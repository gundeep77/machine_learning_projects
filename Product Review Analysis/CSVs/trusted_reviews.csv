Verdict


































The Xiaomi Mi 11 is a tempting phone for the price, and will have you wanting to part with your cash for it over rivals such as the Galaxy S21. In many ways, this is an excellent device; the screen, performance and charging are all top-tier. It isn’t quite perfect, though: there are some issues, especially around the software.



Pros
Strong displayExcellent performance in all areasLikely far more affordable than similarly specced phonesQuick to charge

Cons
It’s very big, with no smaller optionThe software is buggyNo IP ratingCamera choices aren’t always the best

Key Specifications
Review Price: £7496.81-inch 1440p OLED display120Hz refresh rate4600mAh batteryMain 108MP camera


The Xiaomi Mi 11 is a top-tier flagship at a price that undercuts the current headline releases from Apple and Samsung.
If you’re on the lookout for a Snapdragon 888-toting 5G smartphone with a generously sized high-resolution 120Hz display, with less than a grand to spend, then the Mi 11 should be at the top of your list.
On paper, at least, the Mi 11 appears to offer more than the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12. But in use, can it match the best phones and best Android phones?

Xiaomi Mi 11 price and availability
The 8GB/128GB model is priced at €749/749, which is a very tempting price for what’s on offer. A conversion puts that at $902 as there is no US pricing yet.
There’s a 256GB model, too, which will go for €799/£799. Considering the device doesn’t have an SD slot, you’re probably better opting for the 256GB model just to be on the safe.

 
Xiaomi Mi 11 design and screen – A stunning display for the price

6.81-inch OLED display is big, colourful and a standout feature
The lack of IP rating is a shame
120Hz panel with sharp 1440 x 3200 resolution

A few years ago, the notable feature touted by every phone maker on new devices was its camera. Now, it seems, it’s a high-tech display.
The screen tech used by Xiaomi on the Mi 11 is high-end in just about every way – an OLED panel with 1440p resolution, adaptive 120Hz refresh rate and brightness levels that, to my eye, match the far pricier Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra in regular use. 
Considering this is a €749 device, I’m impressed. Load up an episode of HDR-supported content on Netflix and you will be, too. Colours pop, blacks are mostly perfect, and the large 6.81-inch display size makes all content super- immersive. Close-up viewing of some dark scenes may reveal a degree of crushing of blacks, but you’ll only see this if you go looking for it.
The screen is mostly very good 
Like Samsung’s S21 line, the refresh rate here is adaptive, changing rates depending on the task at hand. A faster refresh rate, 120Hz for instance, results in smoother scrolling, while a lower one saves battery when you’re watching videos.
Xiaomi’s software – something I’ll cover in detail further on – does its best to hamper the quality, however, consistently pulling the brightness down to levels that require me to manually increase them.
Of course, a large screen means this is a sizeable phone. It’s comparable to the iPhone 12 Pro Max and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra than their smaller siblings, requiring both hands to clutch it comfortably. Considering this isn’t being marketed as a “Pro” or “Ultra” version, I’m surprised by its size.
Still, at least it’s comparatively light for its size at 195g (slightly less for the Chinese Leather-clad models). It’s slender, too, at 8.1mm, with plenty of curves to give the impression it’s even slimmer.

The display, in particular, makes use of curves, not only on the sides but at the top and bottom too. It gives a very smooth feel, making this handset super-comfortable to hold and use. In the past I haven’t really been a fan of the phones sporting a heavy use of curves – devices such as the Huawei Mate 40 Pro, for example – but here they’re applied more subtly, and don’t get in the way.
Both the front and rear of the Xiaomi Mi 11 are covered in glass – Gorilla Glass Victus on the front; Gorilla Glass 5 on the back. A version of the handset available in China swaps the glass rear for leather.
Displaying a matte sheen, the rear is also home to a nicely designed module that houses the camera. There’s a bit of needless 5G branding, too, but overall the design is clean and simple. It looks good. The review unit is in the Horizon Blue hue, which I wouldn’t say is the most on-trend colour; it seems like a shade that would have been popular in 2017. Personally, I prefer the grey version.
Like most Xiaomi phones, the Mi 11 lacks an IP rating, and the internal storage isn’t expandable. The cheaper price of the device can also be seen with regards to finishing touches. For example, the corners of the device aren’t rounded in the same way as the display; the result is they don’t look quite right. 
Xiaomi Mi 11 camera – A great main sensor paired with some odd choices

108-megapixel main camera can capture great photos
Less impressed with the 13-megapixel ultra-wide and 5-megapixel macro
8K video supported at 24 and 30fps

Xiaomi might be correct in calling the setup on the rear of the Mi 11 a triple-camera array; however, when I hear the term “macro” camera, I tend to discount it from the equation. 

The Mi 11 comes with a main wide sensor, an ultra-wide, and the aforementioned macro unit. There’s no zoom lens of any kind, which is a shame – but acceptable at this price. Around the front sits a 20-megapixel selfie camera housed inside a small cutout.
The main wide camera is the star of the show, and it’s the same 108-megapixel 1/1.33-inch sensor Xiaomi has in other devices. It packs an f/1.9 aperture, OIS along with PDAF for focusing.
As will be the case with all phones that come with 108-megapixel sensors, you won’t typically shoot at that high resolution as the resulting files will be huge and take a toll on processing speed. Instead, the phone uses a technique called “quad-pixel binning”, which combines four pixels into one and spits out 27-megapixel snaps.
You won’t see a significant jump in quality over images taken with Xiaomi’s Mi 10 range of devices, and the Mi 11 isn’t quite up there with the very best cameras phones around. However, it is capable of taking great shots. Colours are nice and punchy and the high megapixel count ensures there’s plenty of detail. 
Detail in shots can be very good
You can only zoom digitally, this is at 2x
Low-light performance can be good
You’ll get your finest shots in bright situations – and in this scenario the Mi 11 can certainly hold a candle to snaps taken on the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21. It isn’t quite as good in tougher conditions, though, with noise and slow focusing becoming more common.
Switch to the 108-megapixel mode and you’ll see a slight increase in the level of detail, but a lot more noise. The trade-off probably isn’t worth it, unless you’re shooting still subjects on an extremely sunny day.
You can utilise all these megapixels to crop in and zoom 2x, 5x, 10x and 30x, but this is purely digital zoom and the results are limited. Digital zoom is no match for optical zoom offered by varying focal lengths, and it’s a shame that Xiaomi hasn’t added such a camera here.
Shots from the 13-megapixel ultra-wide camera get the job done when you’re trying to jam in more scenery – again, as long as the lighting is good. At night, ultra-wide shots display extreme noise and lack detail.
Compared to some other phones that utilise a dedicated macro camera, the 5-megapixel shots taken with the Mi 11 are actually quite good. If you want to shoot up close and personal and pull out good detail it’s a nifty trick. I’m just not sure it’s deserving of having a whole sensor dedicated to it.
The macro camera can take interesting shots
Selfies from the 20-megapixel front camera are very much on the unnatural side, with skin smoothed out. If this is to your taste then you’ll appreciate the results.
Video can be recorded in a variety of resolutions up to 8K at 30fps. I’d recommend sticking to the 4K; the results here are a little more pleasing to my eye – and 8K just takes up so much space. 
Xiaomi Mi 11 Performance – Our first taste of the Snapdragon 888

One of the first phones to ship with the Snapdragon 888
Very powerful 5G chip that can handle everything you throw at it
8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage

Xiaomi might have made sacrifices in some areas; however, when it comes to performance, this is a full-on flagship device. The Snapdragon 888 chipset is paired with 8GB of RAM (a 12GB version is also available in some regions) and either 128 or 256GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage. It’s 5G and Wi-Fi 6 capable, too, if you have access to the right gear. I’d still be wary about recommending you to go out and buy a phone simply as it has 5G, however it should certainly be something to look for if you’re investing in a phone you plan to keep over the next few years.
I ran a number of benchmarks on the Mi 11 in both Geekbench 5 and 3DMark, and the scores it achieved are right up there with the very best phones out there – getting close to the iPhone 12 in some aspects and matching the Exynos Galaxy S21 Ultra. I didn’t even notice the phone getting warm during these benchmarking tests, something my colleague Al mentioned in his Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus review. The handset lived up to these benchmarks results in real-world use, both in gaming and general day-to-day productivity. 
Gaming on this handset is a particular joy, since the 480Hz touch input rate (which basically means the screen captures your finger movement 480 times per second) means your button presses will be relayed very quickly.
The fast chip paired with the fast display makes for a smooth experience that’s only really let down by some issues with the software.
Xiaomi’s MIUI skin, which here sits over Android 11, is heavy – and, during the review period, I found it buggy and unreliable. Apps would crash; the wallpaper would randomly change itself; and notifications would take significant time to appear. For instance, I’d get an alert through the WhatsApp web app that I had a message waiting, without the phone doing anything. This would usually then be followed by multiple alerts 20 to 30 minutes later.
MIUI 12
Xiaomi’s overall design is clunky, too, with the multitasking menu having been changed but presenting no clear benefit. In addition, there are far too many duplicate apps that can’t be removed. I do welcome the ability to pop apps into small windows; however, trying to convert these back to full-screen apps rarely worked as expected. It’s all just a bit of a mess and does detract from the overall experience somewhat.
Also frustrating is the fact that  it doesn’t appear Xiaomi is using the full power of the Snapdragon 888. A new feature added to this chip was supposed to offer smooth switching between camera lenses – but here there are still hefty stutters as you move through them.
An update to MIUI 12.5 is coming, which might fix some of the issues – but in its current state, you’ll have to spend a bit of time getting used to the Xiaomi way.
In terms of audio quality, the Mi 11 impresses with a decent sounding stereo speaker and capable microphones. 
Xiaomi Mi 11 battery life – Big battery and very quick charging

large 4600mAh battery
55W charging with the included plug
50W wireless charging offered, too

Size-wise, 4600mAh sits on the larger end of phone batteries, so I was expecting the Xiaomi Mi 11 to be left with plenty of battery life after a long day, even perhaps getting a good part of the way through day two before requiring a top up. Following a few weeks of use, this hasn’t really been my experience.
The Xiaomi Mi 11 has easily made it through a day; however, on the majority of days I was left with less than 10% of juice. This would then be completely depleted in the morning, if I hadn’t plugped it in. Typically, with the iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, I’m closer to 20% at the end of a busy day.
I’ll caveat this by saying that these figures are with use over Wi-Fi, with no 5G use at all. If you’re moving between networks frequently then you might see even more of a drop.
An hour of Netflix HDR streaming consumed 12% of battery life, which is a lot more than the same test run on any of Samsung’s newest phones.
Of course, you can stretch battery life out further if you tweak the settings, keeping the brightness down, and sacrificing either the 1440p resolution or the 120Hz mode – which got me an hour or so extra per day.
Where the Xiaomi Mi 11 does present a comfortable lead over the S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 series is charging. Not only is a charger included in the box, but with a max 55w charge speed, you can go from 0-100% in about 43 minutes. An 80% charge will take a little over half an hour.

Wireless charging is available, too, with Xiaomi touting 50W speeds. That sounds incredibly fast, but finding a suitable pad may prove tricky.
Xiaomi Mi 11 Conclusion
There’s so much good stuff here. From the screen to the performance and the quick charging skills, Xiaomi is offering a lot for the money. If the software experience was just that little bit better this could easily be one of the easiest to recommend Android phones.
You should buy the Xiaomi MI 11 if…
You want a seriously snappy phone
Getting a Snapdragon 888 chipset for this price is fantastic, and the Mi 11’s performance is among the best you’ll find outside of the iPhone 12. Pair that fast chipset with 5G support and a 120Hz display (with 480Hz polling), and you’ve got a speed champion.
A big, excellent screen is key
For the price, there isn’t a better screen around. The Mi 11’s display beats the S21 and S21 Plus for size and resolution, and includes mod-cons such as HDR, 120Hz refresh and plenty of brightness. 
You shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Mi 11 if…
You want reliable software
Xiaomi’s take on Android is both buggy and a little ugly. There are too many apps duplicating functionality, too, and it can make everything feel a bit heavy.
A zoom camera is a priority
There’s no dedicated zoom camera sensor here, so if you want to achieve excellent results shooting from afar then this isn’t the phone for you.

Key Features




Updated camera systemNew 50MP main camera and secondary ultra wide


Google’s first chipsetPixel 6 is powered by the Tensor chipset


Android 12Featuring the new Material You theming engine


Introduction
The Pixel 6 has had a launch unlike any other phone I can remember, with Google revealing just about every facet of the device ahead of a full release.
Pair that with the excessive number of leaks, including all that Google itself has divulged, and there’s very little we didn’t already know about this phone ahead of its grand unveiling.
But that release is finally here and the Google Pixel 6 is now available to buy. I’ve had the Pixel 6 for about 10 days now and I have many thoughts about the direction Google has taken.
Sporting a new look, a chip designed to Google’s spec, and a completely new camera sensor – plus a very tempting price – the search engine giant is certainly taking phones seriously again. But how does it compare to the other big Android hitters like the Galaxy S21 Plus, OnePlus 9 Pro and Apple’s latest iPhone 13 Pro?
Design and screen
Completely new design6.4-inch 1080p OLED display with 90Hz refreshA flat panel as opposed to the curved 6 Pro
When Google first unveiled the Pixel 6 in August, I was taken aback by how different it looked from other Pixel phones. The striking visor housing the rear cameras, the unique colour combinations and the effort seemingly put in was at odds with the series’ past. Pixel phones have never been ugly, but they’ve always focussed on functionality over visual flourishes.
Despite being initially wowed by the revamped design, my impression was tainted slightly when I first took it out of the box. Maybe seeing it in so many images, both leaked and official, ahead of release made me accustomed to the looks but I wasn’t as impressed as I was expecting.
From a number of angles, the Pixel 6 looks very much like a Samsung phone. You really need to flip it over and see that camera strip to get a real sense of design. Now, my opinion might vary wildly if my review unit wasn’t a very dull Stormy Black hue. It’s not really black at all, but a boring dark grey that gets ever so slightly lighter towards the top. If you want a phone that stands out, the Sorta Seafoam version looks a whole lot nicer.

I also find it strange that Google has opted for a glossy glass rear when the matte finish seems to be the wiser route to take. The Pixel 6 is prone to picking up fingerprints and it needs constant attention to keep it clean. I guess most people will put a case on immediately and never worry about this, but I still feel a matte finish would have been a smarter route to take.
Another odd design choice is the positioning of the volume keys, which sit immediately below the power button. I’ve hit the volume key instead of the power button countless times during my time with the phone. The keys themselves aren’t great either, feeling mushy without any real resistance.

With all that said, the Pixel 6 is still an attractive phone made from 100% recycled aluminium and it feels nice to hold and to use. The sides have this industrial matte finish while the visor covering the duo of camera sensors is easier on the eyes than a huge camera bump. It also allows the phone to rest on a table without moving around too much when you’re typing.
The 6.4-inch screen makes for a nice sized phone. It’s a little bigger than the iPhone 13 and Galaxy S21 but still small enough to slide into decent-sized handbags and back pockets. There’s a nice heft to it too and it is well constructed. 
The phone comes with an IP68 rating, which guards against any water-based accidents, and the glass back allows for wireless charging. These are two features that aren’t a dead-cert on handsets at this price.
Google Pixel 6 vs Google Pixel 6 Pro
One of the notable design differences between the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is the latter’s curving screen. The regular Pixel 6, on the other hand, has a more traditional flat panel – which I actually prefer. Ideally, I would like a flat screen with the specs of the Pro model.
The Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch HDR OLED panel with an in-display fingerprint scanner (that’s the first time we’ve seen this on a Pixel phone), a refresh rate that can switch between 60 and 90Hz, and a 1080p resolution. While these specs aren’t anything special, in practice they translate to a perfectly adequate screen on a $599/£599 phone.
The 1080p resolution doesn’t bother me in the slightest and sharpness is never an issue here. It’s a colourful, bright panel too with three distinct modes for tweaking the colours to your personal preference. HDR video doesn’t quite have the eye-searing bright point of the top-end phones but it’s on par with the similarly-priced Asus Zenfone 8.
One feature I really like is an Extra dim mode which ramps the brightness all the way down. I admit I often check my phone before I go to sleep and this mode makes it a lot kinder to the eyes. Having it easily accessible in the quick settings panel is great too. 
I do miss having a 120Hz refresh rate though and it’s one of few features I really wish this phone had. It’s not that uncommon to see 120Hz at this price (Asus Zenfone 8, OnePlus 9) either.
The 90Hz panel is, of course, smoother than a 60Hz Android screen and it adds some extra zip to scrolling and swiping. It does feel a little janky though and it’s not the most responsive screen around. Sometimes my touches won’t register and other times my swipes to go back to the homescreen will be completely ignored. I’m not sure whether is the screen’s fault, the Tensor chipset or the software, so maybe there’s hope it’ll get fixed.
Camera
Two main cameras on the back, including a new 50MP main sensorNight Sight mode returns, as do many other nice additions
Arguably the most important piece of the Pixel 6’s jigsaw is the camera. Pixel phones have stood out from the crowd in the past as a result of their awesome photo skills and it’s often the thing that has kept me coming back. Pixel phones have often topped our best camera phone lists in the past, because of this.
The Pixel 6 has a duo of cameras on its rear. There’s a big 50-megapixel main wide sensor (1.2μ pixels, f/1.85, 1/13in sensor) and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide with a 114-degree field of view. These hardware features are paired with Google’s very good photo-processing algorithms.

There’s an obvious missing feature here, and that’s any kind of optical zoom lens. Like Apple, with its iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, the telephoto zoom camera is exclusive to the pricier model. If you want the 4x optical zoom, you’ll have to opt for the Pixel 6 Pro. 
All the zoom skills on the Pixel 6 come via digital zoom and while the results are actually not bad (see the images of the coffee beans) it’s not a match for an actual folded zoom lens like the Pro.
For digital zoom, it’s not too bad
The Tensor chip also uses its machine learning and AI skills to add in some new features, such as a Magic Eraser tool that easily lets you remove photobombers from your snaps. This works, most of the time, very well. I found a few shots of people on a beach in my Google Photos library and managed to remove them all completely with barely any warping to the background. I can see myself using this a lot.
There’s a Motion Photo option, too, which adds some spark to snaps of fast-moving objects such as cars, although this doesn’t seem to be accessible on my Pixel 6 review unit. Google has also worked on skin tones, with Real Tone adapting the white balance to better suit diverse skins types. This isn’t something you can turn on or off, it’s just always there and it’s great to see.
These features would all fall into insignificance if the actual photos weren’t good, however.
Let’s start with regular daytime snaps. Most phones can handle these well, but the Pixel 6 certainly impresses thanks to that big sensor. There’s a wonderful shallow depth of field look when you’re up close to an object, like the tacos below, and this gives a real professional look to snaps.
There’s loads of detail in the fur
Bright colours pop
The colours in the photos I captured were mostly natural, though not always. The sky, for instance, in the picture featuring the bridge is far more vivid than it actually was, while some can look a lot duller. There was actually a few times when the image I was seeing through the viewfinder struggled to get a good read on the colours. Sometimes strong light sources can make for a very yellow picture, although the HDR mode does combat this quite quickly. 
(ultra wide) Sometimes skies can look quite saturated, but it’s still a pleasing image
What was never a problem though was detail. There is so much detail packed into these images and it doesn’t turn to mush when you zoom in. With the picture of the dog, the facial fur is distinct without looking too sharpened.
Excellent contrast here and plenty of detail retained
There’s a lot of detail in shots and the big sensor allows for a nice blurred background
In dimmer situations, like inside a bar or a darker room, the photos I took were bright and kept the same hit of detail. There are plenty of images below taken at dusk that show the Pixel’s prowess when the light is beginning to disappear.
There’s a lot of detail packed into the leaves and a nice shallow depth of field
The camera doesn’t struggle when it comes to low light focussing
The sky is nicely exposed, the colours are accurate and there’s a lot of detail
When the light gets even worse, there are two options. The Night Sight mode will kick in automatically and brighten up shots and this is great for static moments where you can keep the phone steady for a few extra seconds. You can also enable Night Sight manually – something you can’t do on the iPhone 13. The bigger main sensor used here does mean Night Sight can be used less as more light hits the sensor and it’s generally better in darker situations without any computational help.
Loads of detail here considering the lack of strong light
Plenty of detail retained and nice reproduction of the colours reflecting in the window
I took the Pixel 6 and iPhone 13 Pro to an Arsenal football match and both churned out very good snaps in the darkness. The shots from the iPhone were marginally warmer in tone (you can see the two below) but whether or not that’s better is down to personal preference. I’d say the Pixel 6 produced an image more akin to what I was actually seeing.
The iPhone 13 Pro shot is warmer in tone
The Pixel 6 is a little cooler
Some of the occasional performance jank I have mentioned throughout this review is present in the camera too. Sometimes when booting from a locked state the camera jumps around in different orientations and flashes to black before it lets me shoot.
For the selfie camera, images are fine but nothing special. It’s a similar story for video, especially compared to the iPhone 13. 4K 60fps video looks good and the stabilisation is excellent, but there’s certainty fewer options here than elsewhere.
Performance
This is the first phone to use Google’s Tensor chipsetThere’s 8GB RAM too, 5G and 128/256GB storageTensor powers many of the ML and AI elements here
One of the most interesting parts of the Pixel 6 is the new chipset. Instead of the usual Qualcomm SoC (system-on-chip) you’d typically find in a Pixel phone (or any other Android handset, for that matter), the Pixel 6 is powered by Google’s own Tensor silicon.
Rumours suggest Tensor is built by Samsung, and is similar to one of the Korean brand’s Exynos chips that you’d find in many European versions of its phones. However, it also features a number of elements that Google has been refining over the years, including a focus AI and ML (machine learning). 
Tensor should give Google more control over the phone and it’s likely one of the reasons that the search giant is now promising a minimum of five years of security updates. Google has only promised three years of actual Android updates though, which is a little concerning. Not because three years isn’t a lot (it is by Android standards) but I had hoped this might be the first Android phone ever to rival iPhones for continued software support.
Paired with the Tensor SoC is the Titan M2 co-processor, which covers all the security aspects of the phone.

It’s important not to purely focus on the performance aspects of Tensor, as it doesn’t really seem to be the area Google is focussing on and there are plenty of phones out there that do place a greater emphasis on pure performance. It falls well behind the A15 Bionic chipset in Geekbench numbers and while it just about beats the Exynos 2100 for single-core performance, it’s not as capable when it comes to multi-core.
Most Android phones are fast enough though, even those that sit in our best cheap phone list.
In real-world use, I haven’t been too concerned about performance, aside from the responsiveness issues I mentioned above. Games play fine and are on par with the higher-end devices powered by Qualcomm chips. There’s 5G support too and 8GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage. Note that there’s no way to up that amount, so choose wisely.
What really excites me about Tensor is how it powers some of the smaller features that have been on Pixel phones before. The auto-translate skills for example are fantastic, as are live captions that appear when you’re watching videos. Tensor seems to make these far quicker to appear. It’s a similar story for the excellent Voice Recording app, which can eerily accurately transcribe conversations almost immediately.
Tensor is also working in the background to aid the camera. Here the AI and ML skills help make features like the Magic Eraser as accurate as they are.
Another highlight of the Pixel 6 is the version of Android 12 it’s running. Android 12 and the Material You theming engine is a step up in terms of the look of the software, and it does feel new and fresh. Icons and default apps now mimic the colours of your wallpaper, while there are a number of redesigned widgets that look great – in particular, I’m a fan of the updated clock which moves around as the seconds tick by. It’s just a shame there are so few of these new widgets from Google itself, with apps like Gmail, Calendar and more still stuck with the old style.

There’s a new look for the quick settings shade that makes those settings easier to spot thanks to larger icons, a really nice Security panel that combines a password checker and device safety tips plus easier access to smart home controls. Some of the new elements take a while to get used to, but overall it’s a sleek update that finally adds something new in terms of design.

Android 12 will of course be available on older Pixel phones (and other Android devices, although don’t expect the same features everywhere), but it does feel as if it has been designed for these Pixel phones specifically. 
Battery Life
4600mAh batteryNo charger included
Throughout the 10 days I have been using the Google Pixel 6 it has typically gotten me through the day with about 5-10% or so left by the end of it.
If you really push it with intensive tasks, especially gaming, it depletes a little faster than I would expect, however standby time is excellent. Forget to put it on charge overnight and it’ll only lose a couple of percentage points come morning.
When it comes to charging Google states this supports up to 30w, however you’ll have to provide your own plug as there’s only a cable in the box. You can buy a 30w capable plug directly from Google (£25) or provide your own. I don’t have one of Google’s, so I used another 30w capable charger for this review.
I managed to get a 50% charge in 36 minutes, while a full 0-100% charge took 115 minutes. I like that you can charge halfway relatively quickly and this should help the long-term health of the battery. It is not, however, among the fastest phones around when it comes to charging.
Qi wireless charging is supported too, though to benefit from the faster 21w speeds you’ll need one of Google’s new Pixel Stands which I do not have access to yet. If that changes, I will update this review accordingly.

Should you buy it?


Software is a big factor in how you use a phone: Google excels at software and there are so many neat tricks here. Plus you’ll get plenty of updates and five years of security updates.


Sheer performance is your key reason to upgrade: Google’s focus with the Tensor chipset isn’t on blazing performance, and for me that’s fine. I prefer the AI and ML elements here more, but if you want the fastest phone around there are better choices, even at this price, like Zenfone 8 or OnePlus 9.









Final Thoughts
For £599/$599, the Pixel 6 is a great choice. A smattering of bugs and odd design choices hold it back from utter greatness, but it packs some of my favourite software features ever on a phone, plus a very capable camera at that. The Pixel line has always had more charm than your typical Android phone, and the Pixel 6 has that in swathes.
If you’re comparing this against the Pixel 5 (which actually launched at the same UK price) then it’s one of the biggest year-on-year jumps I have ever seen in a phone. 
The camera, design, performance and just about everything else has been improved. If you thought Google was going to fall into the rhythm of taking no risks with its phones after 2020’s focus on cheaper devices then both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will prove you wrong.
As has often been the case before, there are some annoying bits that let the phone down. While the design is overall very nice, some choices strike me as odd – notably the glossy back and power key placements. There’s also a little wobble in daily use, with some performance jank and lack of screen responsiveness being an issue.

Key Features




Guaranteed be updated to the next three versions of AndroidPlus 5 years of security patches


Triple sensor rear camera Combines 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide and 48MP telephoto parts


Powered by GoogleRuns using Google’s Tensor CPU + 12GB RAM


Introduction
The Pixel 6 Pro is Google’s latest flagship smartphone. Sitting above the base Pixel 6, it aims to take on top-end phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S21, iPhone 13 and OnePlus 9 Pro.
In its bid to entice users away from the competition, Google’s offering a unique version of Android 12, a super-charged rear camera and, most interesting of all, a new Tensor chip, which adds a number of exclusive features to the phone, including in-app real time translation.
After a week using the Pixel 6 Pro I can confirm the combination adds up to create one of the best all round experiences available on Android. The new camera is excellent, the LTPO, variable refresh rate screen works very well and the software offers the best user experience available on Android at the moment. The only minor downside is that the Pixel 6 Pro’s battery life is mediocre at best.

Design and screen
The Pixel 6 Pro has a very distinctive designYou’ll want to invest in a caseThe screen’s variable refresh rate makes it great for gaming
Unlike past Google phones, which seem to have been designed to look as unassuming as possible, the Pixel 6 Pro has a very distinctive aesthetic. Taking the Pixel 6 Pro out of the box, I was immediately greeted by the phone’s camera housing, which looks like a visor running across the handset’s back.
The 6.7-inch device was also noticeably heavier than the Galaxy S21 Plus I’d been using previously, to the point where it took me a good half hour to get used to the increased heft.
I’d also strongly recommend anyone buying a Pixel 6 Pro to invest in a case. Though the mixed metal and glass design looks nice and feels well built – the back offers little to no flex when pressed during testing – it is a fingerprint magnet. Within seconds of unboxing the Pixel 6 Pro’s back was a smudgy mess.

The glass can also become very slippery when wet. Though it can survive the odd accidental downpour thanks to its IP68 certification, the Pixel 6 Pro regularly became quite difficult to get a solid grip on when met with water. Using it in the gym it felt like my sweaty digits were trying to type on a bar of soap, and I had several near misses while using it in the rain. This was largely due to the fact that, like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and many other 2021 flagships, the Pixel 6 Pro has curved glass sides on its front.
My only other minor quibble with the design is that it doesn’t feature a microSD card slot, meaning you’re stuck with either 128GB (tested) or 256GB of storage, which will be an issue if you plan to take lots of RAW photos or shoot video.
Outside of this the phone ticks all the right boxes. The Pixel 6 Pro is the first Google handset to feature an in-screen fingerprint scanner. The scanner works well enough and I had no serious issues with it.
The Pro’s screen is it’s primary selling point. As well as being bigger than the Pixel 6, which has a 6.4-inch screen, the Pro’s 6.7-inch unit has a higher resolution and offers a 120Hz variable refresh rate.
The latter is a key feature that lets the Pixel 6 Pro match significantly more expensive phones, like the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Galaxy S21 Ultra. Refresh rate refers to how many images per second a screen displays. A higher rate makes the screen feel significantly smoother to use and can aid performance when gaming online by reducing the delay between each image.

The only downside is a higher rate puts a bigger strain on the battery. Variable refresh rates countermand this by only raising the Hz count when there is a tangible benefit. This means the Pixel 6 Pro’s LTPO panel can run as low as 10Hz to save battery when doing basic things, like reading in the Kindle App, before jumping to 120Hz when you launch PUBG mobile.
During testing I found the tech works a treat and makes everything from gaming to editing video much more pleasant on the Pixel 6 Pro than it is on most competing handsets, and a clear step up on the Pixel 5 with its 90Hz non-variable refresh rate screen.
The screen’s also very good for entertainment, offering suitable max brightness levels to stay legible in most conditions, outside of direct sunlight. This, plus its deep OLED blacks, also make it great for watching HDR content. Watching Blade Runner and the city looked wonderfully detailed, with detail in the darkest depths revealed with ease.
However, the Vivid screen mode’s colors look a little overcooked, though this is an issue I experience on most phones. Thankfully there’s a natural option that makes them look more realistic. For those that like overly saturated “punchy” colours, there’s also an adaptive option. This makes the phone display colors in the Vivid setting until you activate an app where color accuracy is key, like the camera.
The only downside for movie goers is that the Pro only features a single speaker. The speaker sits at the phones bottom, next to the USB C charge port. It offers decent enough audio quality and volume for gaming and watching the odd episode of Final Space on Netflix, but the placement makes it all too easy to accidentally cover when holding the phone in landscape, especially if you’re right handed.
Camera
Excellent performance in regular and low lightTakes fantastic portrait shotsNot got the best zoom functionality
Pixel phones have a strong track record in the world of mobile photography. Year-on-year, each new Pixel Trusted Labs tests manages to earn a place on that year’s best camera phone lists. After a week happily snapping away, this legacy continues with the Pixel 6 Pro, which features one of the most developed cameras seen on a Google phone.
The Pixel 6 Pro has a similar camera setup to the regular Pixel 6, featuring a 50-megapixel (f/1.85) main camera with an 82-degree field of view and secondary 12-megapixel (f/2.2) ultra-wide camera with a 114-degree field of view. The only big difference is that it has a third 48-megapixel (f/3.5) telephoto camera with 4x optical zoom and up to 20x Super Res Zoom.
The main camera performs excellently. Testing it directly against the similarly priced Galaxy S21 Plus, I preferred the images taken on the Pixel 6 Pro in nearly every instance. This is largely because Google’s processing is so much better than on any other phone.
Even using the basic auto setting, images taken on the Pixel looked wonderfully realistic. Colours aren’t quite as oversaturated, or over-sharpened as on the Galaxy, and the phone’s auto focus is one of the fastest I’ve tested this year. On the odd occasion images did come out with slight blurring, Google’s also set to release a custom Face Unblur option. This will let you “unblur” people’s faces using an editing option in the Camera and Photos apps. Sadly it wasn’t available on my review unit at the time of publishing. We’ve contacted Google for comment on when it will launch.
The ultrawide is also very capable, offering a smooth shooting experience and generally great results. I was particularly impressed with how well it dealt with minor hand movements. Photos taken by my very excited nephew came out with only minor aberrations, which is a testament to how good the processing and stabilization is.
Low light performance is excellent. Snapping around dim pubs, photos taken on the Pixel 6 Pro looked sharp, retained decent contrast and were pleasingly distortion free.
The Portrait mode is one of the best I’ve seen offering a wonderful bokeh effect that’s reliably free of the aberrations you get on many competing handsets, even when shooting tricky subjects, like my cats. Bokeh is an effect that blurs the background while keeping the photo’s subject matter in focus.
What makes the Pixel shine compared to other phones is its wonderfully simple, but effective editing options. These include basic things like tweaking contrast, or cropping, plus a few custom services you won’t find elsewhere. The coolest of these are the ability to add a bokeh effect to images after the fact and the Pixel 6 Pro’s “Magic Eraser”. The latter uses the phone’s AI smarts to let you crop unwanted parts of an image out, like photo bombers, with a couple of simple taps.
During testing I found, while Magic Eraser doesn’t work on everything,  it was able to reliably let me cut things like people walking in the distance out of shots.

Zoom photography is the only area the Pixel 6 Pro isn’t industry leading. The telephoto lens works well enough for 2x zoom shots, but any more than that and I found I could only get reliably good results using a GorillaPod. The 4x optimal and 20x digital zoom limit also puts it behind many competitors. The Galaxy S21 Ultra remains the industry leader here offering 10x optical and 100x digital zoom capabilities.
The Pixel 6 Pro’s video capabilities are solid. The phone can record in 4K at 60fps and features all the modes most people will need. As ever, Slow Motion remains a highlight, with it performing admirably during testing, creating a fun video of my cats attacking a new toy with ease.
All in all, if you want an easy to use camera phone that doesn’t scrimp on image and video quality, you’ll struggle to do better than the Pixel 6 Pro.










Performance
New Tensor chip is competitive with Qualcomm’s, making it a solid performer for most tasksThere are a few bugs, but these will hopefully be ironed out in future software updates
The Pixel 6 Pro runs using the same Tensor chip as the Pixel 6. The only upgrade is that it features 12GB of RAM, compared to the regular Pixel 6’s 8GB.
Tensor is the first mobile silicon made by Google. The firm made a big deal about this during the Pixel 6 and Pro’s unveiling claiming the new chip is “significantly” better than competing parts in key areas including AI and multi-tasking.
And from what I’ve seen it is an impressive chip. Deputy editor Max Parker reported experiencing some “bugs” testing the base Pixel 6, but I’m yet to encounter any serious performance issues reviewing the Pro.
With everyday use apps open instantly, games run chug free, even with their graphics settings maxed and I’ve been able to comfortably edit images using Photoshop Express with zero issues. The only time I had any minor issues was when gaming on GeForce Now, after the first 30 minutes the phone’s back began to noticeably heat up, though not to the point I encountered CPU throttling.
This is interesting as the phone’s synthetic benchmarks put the chip slightly behind some rivals running Qualcomm’s competing Snapdragon 888 chipset in multi-core performance. You can see how it performed against the 888-variant of the Galaxy S21 Plus in the table below.
Geekbench 5 single-coreGeekbench 5 multi-core3DMark WildlifePixel 6 Pro104629146615Galaxy S21 Plus100632185701
However, the cooler parts about the chip have nothing to do with gaming framerates or benchmark scores. Google openly said it developed the chip to help offer better AI and machine learning powers. This is apparently why the Pixel 6 Pro can offer things like superior image processing, plus nifty extras like real-time translation and transcription services.
The latter two are particularly impressive. The 6 and 6 Pro aren’t the first Pixels to feature real time transcription services, Google phones have done that for a while. But the system here just makes them better. Conversations captured with the Recorder app are instantly transcribed with industry leading detail. This is a serious selling point for anyone that regularly needs to take notes, like journalists or students.
The real-time translation also works great. Powered by Google Translate, I tested the feature with a French friend. The app accurately detected and reported every expletive he threw my way with harrowing detail. I’d share the video as proof, but trust me, the language is not PG-13.
This is indicative of general improvements Google has made to the Pixel’s software, with the 6 and Pro being the first handsets to launch with Android 12 preinstalled.
You can see a full list of all Android 12’s features in our dedicated guide, but the cliff notes is that it’s THE most user friendly version of Android ever made. The service features a new Material You design that reworks everything from app icons to the notification panel in a bid to make the OS more user friendly.
Being made by Google, the Pixels also come with a healthy guarantee that they’ll receive updates to at least the next three versions of Android, which gives them an element of future proofing missing on many other flagships, outside of Apple iPhones.

Battery
The Pixel 6 Pro will last a full day with regular useBut some tasks put a massive drain on the battery
Google also made some pretty bold claims about the Tensor chipset’s power efficiency, making me hopeful its “24 hours” regular use estimate would prove accurate. And for the most part it is.
With regular use I found the Pixel 6 Pro can last a full day. Using it as my main work and personal phone, I generally made it through the day with at least 20%. This entailed making and taking a few calls, constantly checking incoming messages and social media alerts, browsing the web, watching a few videos on YouTube and a 30 minute gaming session on GeForce Now.
Standby times are also excellent. Leaving the phone overnight I never saw more than 1-3% of the battery drop, which is impressive.
But certain tasks outright drain the battery. Video playback saw the phone lose an average of 6-7% of its charge, which is fairly standard. But gaming and video recording put a dramatic drain on the battery.
Playing games offline the phone lost as much as 25-30% of its charge per hour. Going onto GeForce Now running over WiFi or 5G things got way worse. On one occasion I managed to knock a good 45% off the phone’s battery after 40 mins playing Grim Dawn over the cloud.
Thankfully, in these instances it is possible to Fast Charge the Pixel 6 Pro. The device features support for 30W fast charging. A plug isn’t included in the box, so you’ll need to invest in one if you want to take advantage of the functionality. Google claims, if you do, you’ll be able to get 50% charge off 30 minutes at the mains. With real world use I was able to reliably get 50% charge in around 30-40 minutes using a 30W charger, which is impressive.

Should you buy it?


You should buy the Pixel 6 Pro if you want the best user experience Android has to offer. The Pixel 6 Pro is the best way to experience Google’s new Android 12 operating system. Featuring a blissfully bloatware free install of the OS, a number of exclusive services like live translation, and a guarantee it’ll be updated to at least the next three versions of Android, this is the ultimate option for fans of Google’s software.


You shouldn’t buy the Pixel 6 Pro if you want best in class battery life. The Pixel 6 Pro is a very capable phone, but it offers mediocre battery life. Most people will be able to get a day’s use out of it, but if you’re a hardcore gamer it’ll struggle to last more than 3-4 hours, let alone a full day off a single charge.









Final Thoughts
The Pixel 6 Pro is one of 2021 best Android and camera phones. The upgraded rear camera has some of the best processing in the business and can deliver excellent photos in conditions that render many competing phone’s sensors unusable. The new Tensor chip also adds a wealth of exclusive features to the phone’s already excellent Android 12 software, making it an easy recommendation to any buyer looking for a top end Android phone.

Jargon buster

HDR
																HDR stands for High Dynamic Range and refers to contrast (or difference) between the brightest and darkest parts of an image. HDR content preserves details in the darkest and brightest areas of a picture, details that are often lost in old imaging standards. HDR10 is mandated to be included on all HDR TVs. It’s also supported by 4K projectors.
															

Refresh Rate
																The number of times the screen refreshes itself per second.
															

OLED
Organic Light Emitting Diode is panel technology that allows each individual pixel to produce light rather than relying on a backlight. This enables the screen to accurately display blacks by turning off the pixel, resulting in improved contrast compared to conventional LCD panels. 


mAh
An abbreviation for milliampere-hour and a way to express the capacity of batteries, especially smaller ones in phones. In most cases the higher the mAh, the longer the battery will last but this isn’t always the case.",trustedreviews,https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/google-pixel-6-pro

Verdict


































The Sony Xperia 5 III earns a place as a worthy rival to most of 2021’s best flagship phones, offering competitive specs to key handsets including the Galaxy S21 Plus and OnePlus 9 Pro. But its high price and a few missing features make it a good alternative to, rather than an easy recommendation over, most similarly priced Android phones.

Introduction
The Xperia 5 III is the little brother to Sony’s even more expensive Xperia 1 III. However, its price makes it more akin to Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Plus than the cheaper Galaxy S21, and places it in the lower echelon of the flagship phone market.
As a handset it retains a lot of the perks seen on the Xperia 1 III, with highlights including an atypically thin 21:9 design and custom “Pro” camera app.
These perks, plus a solid spec sheet make it a compelling alternative to most of the best Android phones we’ve tested this year. And with real world use I found plenty to like about the phone, with it offering surprisingly long battery life and wonderfully accurate camera performance.
The only downside is that it’s missing a few key features, which cement its place as a good phone that matches, but doesn’t necessarily beat 2021’s best phones.

Design and screen
The Xperia 5 III has an atypically tall and thin designThe screen can run at 120Hz, but it doesn’t have a variable refresh rateThe phone is IP68 water resistant
Visually the Sony Xperia 5 III looks a lot like its big brother. It shares the same design philosophy as pretty much every Sony phone I’ve seen over the last few years. This means it’s got an atypically tall and thin mixed metal design that pairs slightly curved sides with a distinctly flat back.
Some people may bemoan the lack of design flourishes, and there’s no denying it’s tall and narrow body can feel a little weird at first. The metal and glass finish also becomes fairly slippery when even moderately wet and I had more than a couple of near misses using the phone outdoors when it was drizzling. 
But as handsets go it feels like a premium, well built phone. The tall rear camera housing is also suitably discrete. Generally, if you like phones that don’t draw unwanted attention, the Xperia 5 III is one of the best looking available.

I do have some foibles with the design, however. For starters, the front camera is still housed in a noticeably big black bezel on the screen’s top. This makes it look very old-school in a world where iPhone 13-esque notches and Galaxy S21-style hole punch camera housings are the norm.
The phone’s button placement is also a little off if, like me, you’re a southpaw. The phone has three physical buttons on its long right side: a volume rocker about three quarters up its side, a power button just below it and a camera shutter button at its bottom. The problem I experienced stemmed from the fact the power button also features an integrated fingerprint scanner and has clearly been positioned to sit where a right handed user’s thumb would naturally fall.
The scanner works well when used this way. I had no issues with its speed or accuracy. But, holding it in my left hand, the scanner proved a little too accurate with every accidental brush of my index finger being detected, leading to it registering “too many attempts” to be used to unlock the phone in the space of time it took me to take it out of my pocket on several occasions.

Large chin and forehead aside, the screen is generally excellent. Sony’s loaded the Xperia 5 III with a 6.1-inch, 1080 x 2520 resolution, 21:9 ratio OLED screen.
The resolution ensures images and icons look sharp, even if it doesn’t match the 4K offering on Sony’s flagship and the OLED panel ensures blacks are wonderfully inky, giving films, especially in HDR, wonderful punch.
I’m also a big fan of the wealth of screen settings on offer. Out of the box it runs in standard mode, which is the equivalent of the “vivid” setting plaguing most Galaxy handsets. This is the showroom floor setting that overcooks colours in a bid to make the screen look as punchy and vibrant as possible, at the expense of accuracy.
I’m a much bigger fan of the creator setting, which focuses on colour accuracy over vibrancy. I found with the creator mode on, colours were much more natural, and generally more pleasant to look at. The setting also targets creatives that want to take advantage of the phone’s “pro” camera functionality, working to ensure what you see on screen is what is actually being captured.
If, for some reason, you want to have a mix of both, the phone also lets you set the Xperia 5 III to only switch to creator mode in certain apps, though honestly, I’d recommend just having it on all the time.
My only minor issues with the screen are that unlike Galaxy S21 Plus, the Xperia 5 III’s display doesn’t have a variable refresh rate and its aspect ratio can make some apps look a little odd.
A variable refresh rate lets a screen intelligently adjust how many images per second are displayed. This lets it max out its refresh rate when there’s a benefit, like gaming and then lower it to save battery when running processes where there’s no benefit. The tech is a key selling point for the Galaxy S21 line, OnePlus 9 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro/Pro Max.
Considering the Xperia 5 III’s price it would have been a nice addition. Without it, all you can do is pick between 60Hz and 120Hz modes in the screen settings.
The aspect ratio is designed to let the Xperia 5 III play modern movies as they are mastered. If you watch modern epics this does ring true and you’ll get a full screen experience. But on older content, and most TV shows, there are noticeable black borders.
Performance
The Xperia 5 III is a powerhouse phone that uses cutting edge partsGames run smoothly, even in 120HzThough it does heat up with prolonged use
The Xperia 5 III is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G chip seen in most of 2021’s Android flagships. Paired with 8GB RAM this makes it a powerhouse device.
Using the Xperia 5 III as my primary work and personal handset, I didn’t have any real performance issues. The device blitzed through basic picture editing in Photoshop Express, opened applications in milliseconds and ran demanding games, like PUBG with its graphics maxed with zero issue.
The only minor problem is that the device’s back did on occasion get noticeably hot to the touch, though this only happened when running demanding processes, or recording video for prolonged amounts of time, which is hardly a deal breaker.
My real world experience rang true when I synthetically benchmarked the Xperia 5 III. You can see how it performed against key rivals, like the Galaxy S21 Plus, in the table below.
Geekbench 5 single-coreGeekbench 5 multi-core3DMark WildlifeXperia 5 III113236724890Galaxy S21 Plus100632185701
Camera
The camera doesn’t have any killer featuresBut it is surprisingly accurate with colours in auto modeAnd features a powerful Sony Pro setting for serious photographers
The Xperia 5 III features a triple sensor rear camera setup that combines 12 MP, f/1.7, (wide), 12 MP, f/2.3, (telephoto), and 12 MP, f/2.2, 16mm (ultrawide) parts. Upfront there’s a single 8 MP selfie camera.
Unlike a lot of phone cameras from 2021 it doesn’t try and entice users with a flashy feature, like 100x zoom, or a custom “cinematography” mode that adds a bokeh effect to video, ala iPhone 13.
For me this isn’t a bad thing, as in its place Sony has focussed on getting all the fundamentals right. As a result, the auto setting produces photos that are in my mind, superior to what you’ll get on most competitively priced phones. Putting it head to head with the Galaxy S21 Plus the Sony Xperia 5 III offered more realistic shots.
This is largely because Sony appears to have taken a much more muted approach to post-shot processing. Colours don’t appear quite as punchy as those taken on the S21 Plus and shots on the Sony have pleasingly realistic colours. They also aren’t oversharpened to an extreme.

The camera’s ultrawide also performed well when taking cityscape shots and bokeh effects were suitably accurate during testing. Bokeh is an effect where the foreground subject is in focus while the background is blurred.
The only time the auto setting struggled to compete was in low light. Here images were universally usable, outside of pitch blackness, but those taken on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus and Pixel 5 were slightly less noisy.
Thankfully this is easily fixed in the camera’s Pro mode. This is the same custom camera mode Sony’s loaded onto most of its top end phones. It effectively gives you a wealth of camera setting options for key things like aperture, white balance and focus zones in a similar UI to what you’ll find in Sony’s A-series mirrorless cameras. It’s a little daunting to use if you don’t know what you’re doing, but in experienced hands I found it’s possible to take excellent, significantly nicer shots.
The front camera is very by the numbers, being no better or worse than what you’ll find on an iPhone 13 or Galaxy S21 Plus. It can take usable selfies in decent light, but struggles in dim conditions and is more than good enough for Zoom calls.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the Xperia 5 III below.






Battery life
The Xperia 5 III will last a full day’s regular useIt’ll charge in just over an hour, if you have the right kind of plug
Sony’s phones haven’t always offered the best stamina, with past flagships’ 4K resolutions, or fancy video modes proving outright power hogs. But I’m pleased to report this isn’t the case on the Xperia 5 III.
I’ve found the phone easily lasts a full day’s use, even with the 120Hz refresh rate screen setting on.
This entailed regularly checking incoming messages and social media feeds, taking and making calls (Zoom and regular) throughout the workday, an hour’s streaming on YouTube/Netflix and a quick GeForce Now gaming session before bed.
However, like all the phones I test, more intensive tasks do put a bigger drain on the battery.
Streaming video at 120Hz, the phone discharged an average of 8-10% of its charge per hour. Gaming put an even bigger 12-15% drain.
If you want to you can also radically extend the battery by setting it to 60Hz. Here the phone lost an average of 5-6% streaming video and 8-10% gaming.

Should you buy it?


You like Sony phones and want a solid all-around handset: The Xperia 5 III doesn’t have a single killer feature, like the S21 Plus or iPhone 13, but by getting nearly all the basics right it ears a place as one of 2021’s best all-rounders. The only real omission is the screen’s lack of a variable refresh rate, which is odd at this price.


You want the very best Android has to offer: The Xperia 5 III is good at most things, but it’s not the best phone at anything. The Galaxy S21 Plus has a better, variable refresh rate screen and rivals, such as the Pixel 5 beat its camera in low light.









Final Thoughts
The Sony Xperia 5 III is an excellent Android phone that will meet 99% of users’ needs.  It offered solid battery life, a reliable rear camera and a wonderfully clean install of Android.

Introduction
The Coros Vertix 2 is a multisport watch that’s firmly aimed at those who like to spend a lot of time exploring the great outdoors. 
Whether that’s discovering new off-road trails for more scenic runs or hiking and climbing up mountains, the Vertix 2 joins the likes of the Garmin Fenix and the Polar Grit X as watches that want to make better companions on outdoor adventures.
Successor to the original Vertix that launched back in 2019, Coros delivers many more features including full mapping for offline use, an ECG for use outside of checking heart health, plus – in a move that sees the Vertix 2 become more smartwatch-like – a built-in music player.
Priced at £599.99, the Vertix 2 costs the same as the original and matches the price of rival watches such as the Fenix 6 Pro. It’s promising to see a watch go toe-to-toe with Garmin’s outdoor beast, so with the Vertix 2, does Coros deliver the goods?
Design
Touchscreen and always-on LCD panelWeighs 89g50.3mm caseRemovable straps
Like the first Vertix, the Vertix 2 is built for ruggedness, so you can expect a big watch with a hulking bezel, and the kind of qualities that make it fit for holding up in extreme hot and cold temperatures.
The case is 50mm, which is a jump up from the 47mm on the original Vertix, but it remains slightly smaller than Garmin’s Fenix 6X. It’s got a little chunkier, too, moving from 15.6mm thick to 15.7mm. There’s no getting away from the fact that it’s a hefty watch, one that might take some time to get used to having on your wrist. If you like a big watch that looks built for the outdoors, then you’re going to like what you see here.
Like the previous model, that housing is made of a titanium alloy, now with an added PVD coating to bolster things in the durability department. 
There’s a sapphire glass screen and a raised titanium alloy bezel to add more protection to that display. Coros includes a 10ATM water-resistance rating on the Vertix 2, which is actually a drop from the 15ATM rating on the original. Nevertheless, it does still mean this watch is safe to wear for swimming and other water-based activities.

That case is partnered with 26mm quick-fit straps, which are super-easy to take on and off if you want to swap them out for something different. I opted for one of the textured silicone straps, which didn’t cause any discomfort or irritation through testing. You do also have the option of a nylon band, which helps to reduce the overall weight of the device.
Weighing in at 89g with the silicone band, the Vertix 2 is 10g heavier than the original. While this might not sound a lot, over a long period of wearing, it’s the kind of weight difference you might notice. I can’t say that it felt heavy to wear day-to-day and during exercise, but it’s a bit more noticeable when you take it to bed.
Front and centre is a 1.4-inch, 280 x 280 always-on memory LCD screen, which does offer a degree of touchscreen support for some of the features. That’s a bigger screen and improved resolution, now matching what Garmin offers on the Fenix 6X.
Quality-wise, it isn’t the brightest nor most vibrant screen, but it’s designed for strong visibility outdoors, and in that regard it largely delivers. There’s a backlight here, too, although it isn’t the brightest. Coros has also brought over the night mode from its other watches to enable you to keep that backlight on during workouts.
Although there is some touchscreen support here, you’ll mainly interact with the device using the physical buttons – these all sit on the right side of the case. The top button’s primary job is to activate the backlight, while the bottom button lets you quickly scroll through some of your daily stats and can also launch an additional settings menu. Between those two buttons is the digital dial, which you can tap to select things and twist to scroll through screens. Note that you do have the option to disable the digital dial – which, out of the box is used to keep the watch screen locked.

To make the Vertix 2 more attractive to outdoor lovers, Coros has also introduced a Carabiner accessory, into which you can clip the device and attach elsewhere. This is for those who are big into climbing, for example, who may not want to wear the watch on their wrist while taking part in the activity.
Tracking and features
Global offline mappingDual Electrocardiogram for HRV measurementsBuilt-in music player
It’s fair to say that the Vertix 2 isn’t short of a feature or two. Whether it’s tracking activities, getting deeper training insights or performing more like a smartwatch, there’s plenty going on here.
We’ll start with the sports tracking. Here, you get a multitude of modes – around 25 – that include running, mountain climbing, hiking, open water swimming, rowing and skiing, whitewater rafting. You can track triathlons as well. On top of those sports modes, you can follow training plans and add workouts to follow, too. In addition to the core metrics, you can also tap into the Coros EvoLab to view further training insights such as your VO2 Max, Training Load and Fatigue.
For outdoor runs, open water swims and using the gym cardio and indoor cycling and rowing modes, I was pretty satisfied with the Vertix 2’s accuracy. On the whole, Coros watches are known for delivering reliable sports tracking performance, and that remains with the Vertix 2.  
GPS accuracy is something Coros wants to shout about here. That’s because it will allow you to talk to all five major satellite systems at the same time. That’s GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and Beidou. On top of talking to all those systems, it also introduces something called Dual Frequency satellite communication to pick up a better signal faster than the previous Vertix. Coros is also improving GPS plotting for tracking around well renowned spotty areas, such as big buildings, deep forests, or when climbing up rock walls. 
As far as how much these features have improved GPS tracking, I’d say there wasn’t enough of a difference over the other watches (Garmin Fenix and Polar Grit X) that I tested the Vertix 2 against. There’s still a little smoothing in places with the GPS routes, although it does a solid job overall.

One of the Vertix 2’s headline features is proper mapping support. Most of the Coros watch clan offer basic features. However, the Vertix 2 additionally offers the ability to view online and offline street and topographical maps using the digital dial to zoom in and out of maps. When in sports tracking mode, those maps can be viewed when you’re navigating to a particular position. If you’re not doing that, you need to jump into the toolbox screen outside of the sports tracking screen to check in on your location, which isn’t the most user-friendly thing to do.
In terms of how that mapping features work, you’re not getting a rich amount of detail here; you’re still getting the more basic navigation to help you get around. The Vertix 2’s mapping features can’t quite match those offered by the Garmin’s Fenix watches – but it’s a start, with Coros doing well to quickly refine its features.
Like the previous Vertix, a pulse oximeter and optical heart rate monitor are included, which can track heart rate continuously and during exercise. While heart rate accuracy was generally fine for steady-paced workouts, I still opted to grab an external chest strap monitor for more intense sessions, which you can pair via Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the missing ANT+ connectivity here is sure to disappoint cyclists who like to pair multiple devices to their watches.
Coros adds an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, but not in the way that Apple, Samsung or Fitbit have added the potentially useful health feature. Instead, Coros offers the ability to take HRV tests, which last a minute and require you to place your fingers on the watch bezel. After that minute, the watch generates an HRV Index score to indicate stress levels. As such, this isn’t a sensor that will detect signs associated with atrial fibrillation. Instead, the tech is present for more fitness-centric purposes.
Coros is embracing a greater number of smartwatch features, too. Like previous watches, you’ll be able to view notifications from Android and iOS devices. While you can’t act on those notifications, the larger display does at least make them a little nicer to absorb. 
If you own an Insta 360 action camera (the One X2 or One R), you can use the watch to control the camera from afar, too. However, the big addition is a music player, which supports the MP3 file format only. This means you’ll need to connect the device to your computer via the charging cable and drag and drop music you’ve purchased; it doesn’t work with third-party music streaming services. You can make use of the 32GB of storage, which is also reserved for storing routes, maps and workouts. Then you can pair Bluetooth headphones and listen to music without needing your phone nearby.

Battery life
Up to 140 hours in full GPS modeUp to 240 hours in UltraMax mode60 days in general useStrong standby performance
One of the biggest reasons that Coros has become a bigger part of the sports watch conversation is its ability to deliver decent battery life. Pretty much across its range, you’re getting battery powerhouses with and without tracking – and this doesn’t really change with the Vertix 2.
Coros breaks down battery performance based on the features you put into play. For daily use, you can expect 60 days and for full GPS, up to 140 hours.
In UltraMax mode, you’ll get 240 hours – but, obviously, you sacrifice GPS accuracy. If you’re using the dual frequency GPS tracking, battery life drops to 50 hours; add in music and it will last 30 hours.
In our experience, the battery holds very well. On a day without tracking and notifications, as well as features such as continuous heart rate monitoring in play, battery drop-off was 1-2%. For an hour’s worth of using the full GPS mode, the battery dropped by 3%.
When it comes to charging, Coros says the Vertix 2 takes less than 2 hours to charge fully – and this played out in our experience. The charging cable is strikingly similar to the one used on Garmin’s watches, which isn’t a cradle-style that hugs the back of the watch case but one that plugs into the case instead.

Should you buy it?


You want an outdoor watch that can go the distance Along with its tough, rugged build, the Vertix 2 delivers a generous battery life, making it a device you can rely on for weeks as opposed to days.


You want the best outdoor watch out there While the Vertix 2 packs in a great array of features here, you’ll find that mapping support and smartwatch features are better executed by rival Garmin.









Final thoughts
The Vertix 2 makes some significant improvements on the original Vertix, making it a better outdoor watch alternative to the Fenix 6 and the Polar Grit X. It doesn’t quite do enough to knock Garmin off its rugged perch, but if you value decent battery life, a wealth of tracking modes and software that Coros regularly seeks to improve, then the Vertix 2 is still well worth checking out for your next big adventure.

Introduction
The iPhone 13 Pro Max is the ultimate iPhone model, but it’s also comfortably the priciest.
I often get asked what are the most important things to look for when buying a phone. My usual reply to this is to get the phone with the best battery life, screen and camera you can afford.
By this logic, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is the best phone around – if you can afford it. Out of all the flagship devices I have reviewed this year, Apple’s top-tier device has the best screen, best camera and best battery life. That’s quite an achievement.
Screen and design
Similar design to the iPhone 12 Pro but heavierNew Sierra Blue colour120Hz screen for the first time on an iPhone
Apple’s Max version of the 13 Pro is a big device. Like, really big. The 6.7-inch screen makes for a phone that requires two hands for comfortable use and the boxy, squared-off design feels sharp. More so than with any other iPhone 13 model, I much prefer using the Pro Max with a softer case.

It’s heavy too. Taking it out of the box it was noticeably heavier than the already hefty iPhone 12 Pro Max. It took me a few days to get used to the added weight and it can certainly be felt in a pocket. You can see in the pictures below how it compares to the smaller Pro.

But, this is forgivable given that it’s being targeted at people who want a big phone. If you don’t, the iPhone 13 Pro has a near identical feature set and is much smaller. If you’re even thinking about the Pro Max you know the benefits, and drawbacks, of the size.
There are reasons why this is heavier than before. The battery, which I will delve into a lot, is larger and once you’ve read my thoughts on that you’ll probably take those extra few grams. The camera module is also larger and again, the benefits are worth it based on my time with the phone.
Pro Max (left) Pro (right)
While it might not be the most ergonomic phone, there’s no doubting it’s gorgeous. The flat, industrial look introduced with the iPhone 12 Pro returns, along with a new Sierra Blue hue you can see in the sample images. This is a lighter blue than the Pacific Blue we had last year and I think it looks great. The less said about the garish gold the better, though. Graphite and Silver round out the collection.
The body is IP68 for some water-resistant and the front is covered by what Apple calls Ceramic Shield. I used the iPhone 12 for most of the year and I found the Ceramic Shield there did a good job at keeping the screen in good condition. A screen protector is always best though if you want to keep those micro-scratches away. 
The design of the iPhone 13 Pro Max might be similar to the older model, but the display is a big upgrade.
As great as the design is, there is one irritating aspect. The stainless steel sides pick up smudges like nothing else and they require constant attention to keep them looking anything other than quite grim.
The design of the iPhone 13 Pro Max might be similar to the older model, but the display is a big upgrade.
Each previous generation of iPhones (including the regular iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini) have included 60Hz panels so they attempt to refresh 60 times every second. On the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the panel can now refresh up to 120Hz – so 120 times a second. This makes actions, like swiping through homescreens and opening apps, feel much faster.
Refreshing at 120Hz is great sometimes, but not all the time. This is why many Android phones that were locked to 120Hz suffered from awful battery life. To avoid this, the LTPO panel used here is adaptive. It can move between refresh rates depending on the task at hand. This is what Apple calls ProMotion and it’ll be familiar to anyone who has used a recent iPad Pro.

If you’re doing something where 120Hz is likely to make a visible difference, such as scrolling Instagram or gaming, the panel will aim for that – and, in my experience hit it. However, if you’re watching an online video, most of which are shot at 30fps, the screen will slow down. It can go as low as 10Hz in activities such as reading.
ProMotion is a real step forward and I noticed it immediately. Once you’ve used a 120Hz display, it can be hard to go back.
At 6.7-inches, the screen here is ideal for content. Be it reading, Netflix, games or editing snaps. The OLED panel is bright and readable outdoors, while the smaller notch (Apple says it’s 20% smaller) makes Netflix binges a little more immersive. The notch will remain an irritant even in its smaller size to those who disliked it before and it’s hard not to feel like, all these years later, Apple could have adopted something a little less intrusive.

I watched a few episodes of the Apple TV+ show Foundation in HDR on the big display and it certainly gave good results. Blacks are perfect, colours are natural and the extra brightness is especially welcome in scenes with bright light and explosions.
Camera
Three rear cameras, plus a LiDAR sensorWide, ultra wide and optical zoomCinematic mode for video
Along with the big upgrades to display and battery life, the iPhone 13 Pro Max also packs Apple’s most impressive camera system to date.
You don’t need to go for the Max model this year to get the true flagship camera experience though, with both Pro models packing the same exact specs.

The triple-camera array consists of a 12-megapixel wide sensor with an f/1.5 lens along with a 12-megapixel f/1.8 ultra-wide with a 120-degree field of view. The set is completed by a 12-megapixel 77mm telephoto capable of 3x optical zoom. There’s also a LiDAR sensor to help with low-light portraits. 
That 12-megapixel wide camera has far larger pixels and a wider aperture than the 12 Pro Max, allowing more light into the sensor for better low-light performance and a more natural depth of field effect.
The benefit of both of these becomes clear when shooting at night, where pictures are clear and detailed without as much reliance on the slower night mode. The shots of cheeses and food below were taken, with night mode off, in near-total darkness with the only source of light coming from a few candles. Yet, detail is plentiful and colours are nice. There’s also none of the overly bright areas often seen on night mode shots. There are still bouts of odd lens flare when shooting at night which can certainly be annoying.
There’s great detail and colour in night shots
There’s great detail here
The optical zoom is 3x this year, so 77mm, but it does have a slower f/2.8 aperture. This means it’s better in daytime for getting closer and taking portraits and worse at night when compared to the f/2.0 lens on the 12 Pro Max. I’ll take the sacrifice, as I mainly use the zoom in the day. 
I do wish the iPhone had a zoom that could rival the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, though.
Optical zoom is 3x, or 77mm
In daylight situations each of the sensors is great. The ultra wide has the fewest upgrades, although you can now utilise night mode here for some striking low-light landscapes. 
The ultra wide is also used for the new Macro mode, which enables (often frustratingly) every time you get close to something. The results are really good, but sometimes I would just prefer the natural bokeh from the main sensor. Apple has said it’s releasing an iOS update to alter the way this works later in the year.
Pictures have loads of detail
The bigger pixels and wider f/1.5 aperture on the main sensor make it incredibly capable of capturing the lovely depth of field, while the Deep Fusion computational tech pulls extra detail in things like fur. You can see this in the picture of the dog below.

The big sensor gives a nice natural blur
There are also some new options for making the photos a little more personal, with Photography Styles. These can up the contrast, up the colours and make pictures warmer or cooler. If you’re coming from a Samsung phone and like its punchy colours, try the Vibrant mode.
These are a step further than a filter, as they change certain bits of the snap only and can’t be reversed once used. It feels very un-Apple to have this much control and hopefully it’ll filter through to other areas of the OS in the coming years.
For the ‘Pros’, there’s ProRAW – Apple’s take on the RAW format – and, coming in a future update, ProRes video recording. While I can’t make a judgement on ProRes yet, ProRAW is great and I often switch it on when I have time to really set up a photo and spend a bit of time editing it afterwards. The RAW format holds much more data and allows much more control when it comes to the edit, but it also keeps all that computational goodness achieved by Deep Fusion and Smart HDR.
What’s less Pro is the Cinematic mode, which is a video portrait mode that has some focus racking included too. This means it can smartly switch focus between objects and faces to give a ‘cinematic’ look. The racking stuff is very good, so it’s a shame the portrait effect feels very artificial and fake. Hopefully, like portrait mode before it, it improves with software updates. The fact this mode tops out at 1080p 30fps means most will stick with the standard video modes, which remain best-in-class.

I’d have liked to have seen some more upgrades to the front camera. The 12-megapixel selfie camera has been the same for generations now, and it could really do with a little more attention.
Performance
Apple A15 Bionic chipset6GB RAM, up to 1TB storageMore 5G bands
Performance across the whole iPhone 13 range is very much the same, even though the Pro models have a slightly more graphically capable version of the A15 Bionic inside, I can’t say you’ll notice that extra core.
The A15 doesn’t feel like a huge upgrade on the A14, at least on the surface. Scores in benchmarking apps are a little higher and it helps enable features like the Cinematic mode and the forthcoming support for ProRes.

I played countless games from Apple Arcade and they ran like a dream. You’ll also get higher frame rates, if the title supports it, thanks to the ProMotion display.
Alongside the A15 Bionic there’s 6GB RAM (2GB more than the regular iPhone 13). I’ve found apps stay in memory longer than the iPhone 12 Pro Max, even though the amount of RAM is the same. Storage starts at 128GB, but you’re better off ignoring that and going for either 256GB or 512GB – you’ll thank me when you start downloading games, HDR videos and shooting in Apple’s ProRaw format. If you plan on shooting a lot of ProRes video, the 1TB storage option is for you.
There’s a wider selection of 5G bands this year thanks to a new 5G modem. Some regions, such as the USA, will get a model with mmWave 5G. We don’t have mmWave 5G yet in the UK, so don’t expect to see that here. There’s no Wi-Fi 6E which might annoy those who invested early in a compatible router. Call quality, Wi-Fi reception and speaker quality are all excellent.
I haven’t spent much time on iOS 15 in any of my iPhone 13 reviews, mostly because it’s available even on older models. However, it does feel like more attention should have been given to the bigger screen size available here. It baffles me that there isn’t split-screen support for multitasking. Some sort of smaller Apple Pencil would be great for note-taking, too.
Battery Life
Very good battery lifeNo USB-C with Apple still using LightningMagSafe charging supported
The battery life on the iPhone 13 Pro Max is truly excellent. I’d say it’s the best on any mainstream flagship phone I have reviewed this year, far outlasting big releases from Samsung, OnePlus and others.
For example, in the first weekend I spent with the phone it lasted from 9am on Saturday morning to 7pm on Sunday. That’s nearly two full days of moderate, weekend use from a single charge. On a typical workday throughout the review period, I was often left with 40% come bedtime.
This changed how I used the phone. Charging it up less at night, and more in the morning or in the evening.
The powerful screen still sucks through juice when you’re streaming HDR content, so it’s possible to eat through the battery much quicker if you’re really pushing it.
You’ll need to provide your own charging block for the iPhone 13 Pro Max as a cable is all that’s included in the box. If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone like the X or XS (or older) you should ditch the slow 5w charger that came with those and get yourself a faster one, ideally 20w.
With a 20w plug, a full charge took me just around 90 minutes. While charging to 50% took around 30 minutes. This is far from the quickest around (Xiaomi’s 11T Pro can go from 0-100% in about 17 minutes) but it’s still adequate.

Wireless charging is an option, though it’s always going to be slower even if you use a 15w enabled MagSafe charger. Most Qi chargers tend to top out at 7.5w when you’re charging an iPhone, so they’ll take a good number of hours to give you a full charge.
Apple’s decision to stick with the Lightning port feels like a misstep, especially on these Pro phones. USB-C is far faster for data transfers, something important if you plan to shoot a lot of ProRaw and ProRes with this phone.

Should you buy it?


You want the best iPhone: If its cost and weight are not problematic, then this is the best iPhone 13 model going. It has a great screen, long battery life and impressive cameras. 


You have small pockets: This phone is big, really big. It’s also very heavy and hard to use with one hand.









Final Thoughts
The iPhone 13 Pro Max is everything I want in a big phone. The screen is glorious, the battery life unmatched in the flagship space and the camera exceptional. If you can handle the size, and the price, you won’t regret it.

Jargon buster

5G
Offering faster download and upload speeds when compared to 4G. Great for game streaming and HDR video playback. Not supported everywhere yet and speeds vary wildly. 


HLG (Hybrid-Log Gamma)
																HLG is a HDR format co-developed by the BBC and Japanese national broadcaster NHK for transmission of broadcast and live streamed content in HDR. It’s backwards compatible with SDR transmission standards, enabling people without a HDR TV to receive the same feed but downsampled.



Dolby Vision
																Dolby Vision is a variant of HDR, adding a layer of dynamic metadata to the core HDR signal. This dynamic metadata carries scene-by-scene (or frame-by-frame) instructions from content creators on how a TV should present the images to improve everything from brightness to contrast, detailing and colour reproduction.
															

HDR
																HDR stands for High Dynamic Range and refers to contrast (or difference) between the brightest and darkest parts of an image. HDR content preserves details in the darkest and brightest areas of a picture, details that are often lost in old imaging standards. HDR10 is mandated to be included on all HDR TVs. It’s also supported by 4K projectors.
															

Lightning
																Apple’s port of choice for charging and data transfer. You’ll find it on the cheaper iPads and all of Apple’s phones.

Design and screen
First iPhone to boast a 120Hz display, up from the standard 60HzThis makes for far smoother navigationSlightly smaller notch for the front camera system
Explaining the benefits of faster refresh rate displays and 120Hz is difficult. It’s really one of those things you need to try out in the shop to get a feel for what it adds. 
All previous iPhones (and the iPhone 13) have included 60Hz panels, which means they attempt to refresh 60 times every second. But on the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro, the panel can now refresh up to 120Hz – or 120 times a second.
At its most basic, this makes actions feel faster. There’s no jarring as you scroll through a website or around the homescreen, while apps rise into view smoothly. 
Refreshing at 120Hz isn’t always a good use of power, however, so these LTPO panels are adaptive – they move between refresh rates depending on the task at hand. This is what Apple calls ProMotion.

When you’re doing something on your phone where 120Hz is likely to make a visible difference, such as scrolling Twitter or gaming, the panel will aim for that – and, in my experience, hit it. However, if you’re watching a YouTube video, most of which are shot at 30fps, the screen will slow down. Reading a book? It will get even slower, down to a low of 10Hz.
My only slight disappointment here is that there isn’t a way for the screen to go down to 1Hz, which could have enabled a clever always-on display to keep the time and notifications always visible. Apple engaged a similar trick on the Apple Watch, and with so many Android phones including these always-on displays, it feels like a missing trick on the iPhone 13 Pro.
I noticed the benefits of ProMotion right from the setup screen, and even following a week of use, its effects still stand out. The smoother scrolling is noticeable everywhere (especially in Apple’s apps and those updated to fully take advantage), and now when I pick up the iPhone 13 or iPhone 12 Pro, it just feels slower. 
Now, Apple is far from the first to implement such tech. There were 90Hz screens on Android phones in 2017, while both the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the OnePlus 9 Pro use similar LTPO panels. I’m just glad Apple has finally brought the tech to the iPhone, since it always felt like the missing piece.
ProMotion aside, the iPhone 13 Pro’s screen is sublime – right up there with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra for quality. The OLED panel delivers deep blacks with infinite contrast, while the brightness levels make outdoor readability among the best I’ve seen.
While the larger 6.7-inch Pro Max is certainly the one to go for if you watch a lot of videos on your phone, the 6.1-inch is no slouch. I loaded up a few episodes of Our Planet on Netflix and Foundation on Apple TV Plus, and the vividness and vibrancy of the colours displayed are glorious. To my eyes it’s a less saturated display compared to the Samsung flagships, showing more natural tones.

One of the more obvious visual changes is the smaller notch that houses the TrueDepth front camera system. Apple says it’s around 20% smaller, but really it’s just narrower rather than smaller all around. If you’re not a fan of the notch, then you’re unlikely to be swayed here. If it didn’t bother you before, then you’re likely to remain unaffected by it here.
Following the huge design refresh with the iPhone 12 Pro, the 13 Pro series was always going to stick to that same blueprint – and, visually, the iPhone 12 Pro looks very much like the outgoing model. 
It’s slightly thicker and heavier (the Max, in particular, is very heavy; see below for all the weights and dimensions), with a far larger camera module to house the new photography setup. Everything else, from the shiny stainless steel sides to the frosted back and the Ceramic Shield front, is the same. It retains an IP68 rating, too.

The gripes I had about the iPhone 12 Pro’s stainless steel sides remain here: even on the 13 Pro, these areas quickly become greasy and smudged. 
Apple has added an additional colour option with the 12 Pro, however, in the form of Sierra Blue. It isn’t as rich as the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro – it has a silvery finish – but I like it a lot. The other colours are Gold, Graphite and Silver. It would have been nice to see some more fun colours of the type seen on the iPhone 13 make their way over to the Pro, especially the more pastel hues. It seems that Apple prefers to keep the Pro models looking a little more clinical, introducing only one standout colour each year.

When Apple launched the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, both models were fairly different. If you wanted in-body stabilisation or the bigger, wide sensor, you had to opt for the 6.7-inch Max model. This isn’t the case anymore.

Both the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max come with the exact same camera – and, in many situations, it’s the best smartphone camera around.
The triple-camera array consists of a 12-megapixel wide sensor with an f/1.5 lens, a 12-megapixel f/1.8 ultra-wide for a 120-degree field of view, and a 12-megapixel 77mm telephoto capable of 3x optical zoom. There’s also a LiDAR sensor to help with low-light portraits.
That 12-megapixel wide camera has far larger pixels and a wider aperture than before. Apple claims this can let in 2.2x more light than before. In addition, Apple claims the new ultra-wide can also let in 92% more light.
The 12-megapixel wide camera is simply stunning. Those bigger pixels give images more natural depth, while the level of detail captured, especially in fur and hair, is fantastic. Apple’s Smart HDR system is now in its fourth iteration, and it does a wonderful job of levelling out dynamic range and colours in trickier situations while keeping everything looking realistic.

Look at the images below, you can see the specks of sand attached to the dog’s face and the individual strands in the sheep’s coat. Again, in the shot of the dog on the beach, there’s a lovely natural blur in the background that all comes from that bigger sensor.
There are huge amounts of details and a nice natural background blur
There’s excellent detail here in the sheep’s face
However, it’s at night where we see the biggest differences. The iPhone 13 Pro relies on its dedicated Night mode far less, since the wider aperture lets in plenty of natural light. The shots below of food were taken in near-complete darkness, with only a smattering of candles for light. Yet, there’s plenty of detail and natural colours on show. The light sources are also properly exposed; they’re not blown out.
Low light look great – this is without the night mode and lit surely by the candles
The Night mode is still present, and you can see how it helps get far more oomph in the sunset shots below. You still can’t enable this Night mode manually – it just jumps into action when the light is particularly low.

Main camera aside, the optical zoom has now been bumped up to 3x (77mm), so you can punch in a little more than before. This is fantastic for portraits – and you can get some quite striking images. However, it isn’t comparable to the zoom features of the S21 Ultra, which still pull out far crisper shots thanks to the periscope setup.
The optical zoom is now 3x
The zoom camera has a slower lens when compared to the 12 Pro. It’s now f/2.8 rather than f/2.0, meaning that while daylight zooming is better, at night it’s fractionally less capable than before.
Finally, there’s the ultra-wide. This 12-megapixel sensor is pulling double duty this year, since it’s used both for typical ultra-wide shots and for the new Macro mode. The ultra-wide shots I’ve taken are generally pleasing, with Apple managing to keep the colours between the three sensors looking very even.
In typical Apple fashion, the way in which the Macro mode works is a little odd – and it seems like changes are coming in a future update. Currently, this Macro mode comes on automatically when you get close to an object; there’s no way to turn it off. This would be fine, but you lose some of the natural bokeh that can be captured by the main sensor. As such, this option might not always be preferable.
But in certain instances, the Macro mode is fun and can be used to take some great shots. It’s far better than any Android phone with a low-res macro sensor and, as you can see from the two images below, it does grab some fantastic details.


Over on the video side, there’s a new Cinematic mode that is basically Portrait mode for video. It takes this idea further by adding in focus racking, which allows the camera to switch focus points if a face turns away, for example. 
Like Portrait mode when it was first introduced, the effect is a little janky in its current form, going from looking great to terrible super-quickly. But, the focus racking works well and I hope the effect will improve in the future. Be warned it only works up to 1080p 30fps, so factor that in when you’re deciding which mode to shoot with.
Later in the year, the iPhone 13 Pro will also gain support for ProRes recording – a format that allows for greater control over colour grading in post-production. Oddly, if you have the 128GB Pro model then you won’t be able to shoot ProRes in 4K, likely due to the space it takes up.
I’d have liked to have seen some more upgrades to the front camera. The 12-megapixel selfie camera has been the same for generations now, and it could really do with a little more attention.
However, my biggest criticism of the camera is the app, which is beginning to feel quite bogged down by all the modes and options. It remains basic in parts, but still convoluted and confusing. Options are hidden behind tiny UI elements, and all the different video options are separated from each other. For example, the new Photography Styles feature is hidden away, not easy to find.
These Photography Styles provide a little more control over the look of your snap. The Vibrant style boosts colours and saturation, very much in the vein of a Galaxy S-series flagship. The High Contrast option ups the dynamic range, producing striking results that aren’t too dissimilar to those from a Google Pixel. Finally, there’s Warm and Cool, both of which do pretty much what they say on the tin.
The Default style
The Rich Contrast style
The Vibrant style
It’s important to not view these options simply as filters. They directly alter the pipeline of the image, meaning you can’t flick between styles or remove them once you’ve taken the photo. Still, they’re a welcome addition.
Performance
The new A15 Bionic chipset is fast, even if the improvements are mainly for the extra features6GB RAM and up to 1TB storageMore 5G bands
Powering the phone is the A15 Bionic, which has a six-core CPU, five-core GPU and a 16-core neural engine for AI tasks. Apple has kitted out the Pro models with a five-core GPU rather than the four-core version in the iPhone 13 – although the benefits of this aren’t clear. There’s also 6GB of RAM, which is a 2GB boost on the regular iPhone 13 models.
I ran a round of the Geekbench 5 synthetic benchmarking app to get a quick overview of the performance of the A15 Bionic, and the results impressed. In the multi-core test, the score of 4791 comfortably beat the best Android phones and the 4007 score of the iPhone 12 Pro.

But benchmarks only tell part of the story; it’s the day-to-day improvements that typically make the bigger difference. Following use of the iPhone 13 Pro for a full week, I can’t say that the A15 Bionic makes it feel any faster than before. But, that’s not to say that extra oomph isn’t required. It powers the Cinematic mode, the Live Text feature in iOS 15, and the ability to shoot ProRaw and ProRes. It also ensures that the ProMotion screen works as well as it can.
All the games I tried from Apple Arcade (The Pathless, Asphalt 8+, Sayonara Wild Hearts) played without a hitch. Some games can even use that ProMotion refresh rate to play at 120Hz, with menus at 60Hz to save battery life.
There’s a wider selection of 5G bands this year thanks to a new 5G modem – and some regions, such as the USA, will get a model with mmWave 5G. There’s no Wi-Fi 6E support, though, which might annoy those who invested early in a compatible router. Call quality and Wi-Fi reception are both excellent.

The base storage size is still 128GB, with 256GB and 512GB the two options I’d suggest for most people. Then there’s a 1TB version – a first for an iPhone. That 1TB model might come in handy if you plan to shoot photos purely in ProRaw and video in ProRes – since, of course, there’s still no expandable storage.
Battery life
No charging block includedBetter battery life than the previous two Pro modelsA full charge in less than 100 minutes
All the iPhone 13 models have received big, very noticeable upgrades to their endurance. The iPhone 13 Pro lasts far longer than both the 12 Pro and 11 Pro.
If you want the absolute best battery on an iPhone ever, go for the 13 Pro Max. However, the 13 Pro has still comfortably managed to get me through the day, working into the next day if I wasn’t pushing it too hard. 
Most nights after a long workday I was left with 10-15% in the tanck, and that’s after many hours of screen-on time, along with bouts of streaming from Audible and YouTube, and constant Slack, Whatsapp and email alerts.
This increase in stamina comes from a few different upgrades. There’s a bigger battery, a more efficient chipset and ProMotion.
Charging is still via Lightning, which means we’re still waiting for an iPhone with USB-C. For a Pro phone that could be transferring countless gigabytes of ProRes footage, the slowness of Lightning (which runs over USB 2.0) just isn’t up to much.
The actual charge speeds are pretty quick, even if phones from the likes of Xiaomi and OnePlus leave it in the dust. Using a 20W charger (not included) and the included USB-C to Lightning cable, I managed 15% in 9 minutes; 50% in 33 minutes and a full charge in 98 minutes.
If you prefer the wireless life, the iPhone 13 Pro supports both the standard 7.5W Qi charging and Apple’s own MagSafe solution. The latter charges at 15W.

Should you buy it?


You’ve been longing for a 120Hz display on an iPhone: The 120Hz ProMotion screen here is glorious; it’s great to see Apple finally add the feature we’ve been enjoying on Android phones for years.


You want the best zoom camera: I love the camera on the iPhone 13 Pro, but it would be nice to see Apple follow Samsung’s lead (among many others) and utilise a periscope zoom. Until then, the iPhone’s zoom will never be quite the best. 









Final Thoughts
The iPhone 13 Pro looks great, includes one of the best cameras around, and far better battery life than I’ve ever seen before on a smaller-sized Pro model. It’s a fantastic phone that ticks just about all the boxes.
The addition of the 120Hz display feels like the icing on the cake. For so long this has been a glaring omission from the iPhone spec list, reserved for Android devices only. Now that’s no longer the case – and it’s great news.
If you upgraded last year then the iPhone 12 Pro remains excellent, and rumours of a big redesign coming next year (possibly without a notch) could make it worth sitting tight for an extra 12 months. If you own an older iPhone (or Android, for that matter) then the benefits here will be instantly noticeable.

Introduction
The iPhone 13 is here, bringing with it a number of smaller updates over the now much more affordable iPhone 12.
On paper, the iPhone 13 might seem more like an iPhone 12S: a moderate year-on-year upgrade that tightens the screws, tweaks the internals, and focuses on one notable upgrade.
Following an extended period using the phone, however, the iPhone 13 does feel like a meaningful release. Probably not for those who invested last year, but certainly for those who have been hanging onto an iPhone XS, X or older.

Design and screen
A 20% smaller notchBrighter OLED displaySame IP68 rating and Ceramic Shield as the iPhone 12
Apple went big with the iPhone 12 redesign, ridding the curved sides of older models, and giving the new device a refresh that harked back to the iconic iPhone 4 and 5. It was a welcome change, especially after years of the curved iPhone 6 look.
With such a significant change to the iPhone’s exterior happening a mere 12 months ago, this update was always going to be iterative. Apple has made some design changes, but they’re all fairly minor.
The notch is 20% smaller, which is welcome but still more annoying than most of the Android competition that have switched to hole-punch style cutouts for the front cameras. On the iPhone 13 Mini, the smaller notch is most welcome; but here it doesn’t have much of an impact. It would have been good to use that extra space to display the battery percentage, for instance. 
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
The iPhone 13 is also slightly heavier and thicker, to account for the bigger battery and upgraded camera module. Unless you hold the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 next to each other, however, you’re unlikely to notice this difference. The larger camera bump does mean that the device won’t fit into older cases, though, which might prove annoying to some but is hardly a surprise.

Apple has introduced a couple of new colour options this year. Starlight adds a hint of gold to a silver body, while the Product(RED) model you’ll see pictured is a deeper shade than before; it really is quite striking.
Midnight is a very dark blue that looks almost black, plus there are blue and light pink options, too. This isn’t quite the standout selection of colours we’ve seen in recent years; I’m disappointed that there’s no pale green and purple option – both of which I really liked on the iPhone 12.
The upgrades that Apple added with the iPhone 12 remain, including Ceramic Shield and the IP68 water-resistance rating. I used an iPhone 12 for an entire year, and despite a few drops and no screen protector fitted, the phone still looks in good condition. There are a few micro-scratches on the display – obviously, fitting a screen protector would have alleviated such issues – but they aren’t too bad. I’d hope it would be a similar case this time around. 
It’s the iPhone 13 Pro model that gets all the big-screen upgrades this time around, and it’s a shame the iPhone 13 sticks with the standard 60Hz panel – although it is a very good 60Hz panel. 
ProMotion, which adds an adaptive refresh rate that can ramp up to 120Hz and down to 10Hz, is one of the headline additions to both Pro models – and I have to say it’s my favourite iPhone upgrade in years. 
A faster display isn’t really something you wish for when you haven’t already experienced it, but once you have, it’s hard to switch back to a 60Hz panel. Scrolling, swiping and gaming all feel super-smooth; it just makes animations and movements so much faster. Judging by Apple’s past releases, I’d expect ProMotion to trickle down to iPhone 14 models next year.
Still, the iPhone 13 features a great OLED display. The smaller notch is welcome when watching videos, while the extra hit of brightness (an 800 nits max in general activities and 1100 in HDR video) is of slight benefit when reading messages or viewing Google Maps directions on sunny days. It isn’t a reason to upgrade, however.
Apple’s screens tend to be some of the more neutral around, reigning in the overly saturated look of Samsung’s panels. Colours are vibrant and immersive, without feeling lurid. An episode of the visually stunning Our Planet on Netflix showed this off perfectly, with fantastic contrast and accurate colours.
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
You don’t have any control over the screen, though. Don’t expect to find multiple presets available if your preference is for a cooler, or warmer, panel.
Camera
A duo of new 12MP sensorsNew diagonal orientationFocus on video with a new Cinematic mode
The biggest spec upgrade for the iPhone 13 comes by way of the duo of cameras on the back. The new cameras here – wide and ultra wide – are pretty much identical to what you’ll find on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, minus the optical zoom of course. This is great considering that was one of the best camera phones around.
The main wide camera remains at 12 megapixel, with an f/1.6 lens, while the 12-megapixel ultra wide has a slower f/2.4 lens and a 120-degree field of view.
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
This is impressive stuff, especially when you consider last year’s smaller Pro model didn’t even have this camera. It makes this a sizeable upgrade over the iPhone 12. 
The camera sensors themselves are much larger (1.7µm on the iPhone 13 vs 1.4µm on the iPhone 12) to allow in more light. The main wide sensor now has in-body stabilisation, too, which Apple calls Sensor Shift stabilisation. Both of these upgrades help significantly in low-light situations – the pictures I snapped when the lighting was less than stellar were similar to those taken with the 12 Pro Max.
Shooting at night, in darker bars and restaurants, is a real highlight. The iPhone 13 tends to force itself into the dedicated Night mode more often than the iPhone 13 Pro, but the results are supremely detailed with natural bright points and minimal noise. Such results were impressive on the £1099/$1099 Pro Max last year, but even more so on the more affordable iPhone 13.

Daylight photos taken with the previous model were decent, and it’s hard to tell the difference between landscape shots taken with the iPhone 12 and the 13. However, if you’re coming from an even older iPhone then the difference is far greater, with punchier colours and sharper details apparent. That bigger wide sensor also helps with a more natural bokeh effect (the soft blur that surrounds an object when you get up-close), which is always welcome. If you want a stronger, more customisable blur then the dedicated Portrait mode is excellent. 
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews): Portrait mode is great and very capable at cutting around details
Apple is giving you a little more control over the look of your snaps this time around with a new software feature called Photography Styles. The Vibrant style, for instance, boosts colours and saturation, very much in the vein of a Galaxy S-series flagship. 
The High Contrast option ups the dynamic range, producing far more striking results that aren’t too dissimilar to those from a Google Pixel. Finally, there’s Warm and Cool, both of which do pretty much what they say on the tin.
It’s important to not view these options simply as filters, since they’re more than that. They directly alter the pipeline of the image, meaning you can’t flick between styles or remove them after you’ve taken the photo.
Cinematic mode got a lot of screen time during the device’s reveal and it isn’t hard to see why. It’s almost a Portrait mode for video, but it takes this idea further by adding in focus racking, allowing the camera to switch focus points – for example – if a face turns away.
The blur effect is far from perfect, but it’s much better than attempts made by the Android competition; plus, the focus racking works very well. I lined up a number of objects, with the camera changing focus smoothly as I moved them away. It worked well with faces, too.
You can record Cinematic mode in HDR Dolby Vision up to 1080p at 30fps, far lower than the 4K 60fps maximum in the standard video modes.
I wouldn’t call Cinematic mode a gimmick. It works well and I’m sure that, like Portrait mode before it, it will get better over time. I just can’t see who would use it consistently, especially since the formats and the ability to edit focus points is restricted to Apple’s own software.
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
Where I’d have liked to see some greater upgrades to the camera is around the front. The 12-megapixel selfie camera has remained the same for generations now, and it could really do with a little more attention. Selfies are flat and lack the nuance of snaps taken by the rear cameras.
Performance
A15 Bionic powers the phoneWider 5G band support4GB RAM, 128GB base storage
Apple’s silicon is now past the point where it’s valid to say a new chip makes the phone feel faster. iPhones have felt fast for years now, and the advancements to the A15 are far beyond upping some benchmark scores or making web pages load faster.
The A15 Bionic powers the Cinematic mode with its focus racking and constantly changing blur effects. It also powers stuff like the ridiculously useful Live Text feature, which can pull addresses and phone numbers from your photo library.
Inside the chip is a six-core CPU, four-core GPU and a 16-core neural engine for AI tasks. Interestingly, Apple has kitted out the Pro models with a five-core GPU – although I didn’t notice any real differences through testing. The A15 Bionic is paired with 4GB of RAM, which is identical to the iPhone 13 and 2GB less than the Pro models.
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
The iPhone 13 is fast in all tasks you throw at it. I’ve tried countless Apple Arcade titles and they all run without a hitch, while apps open instantly. While I’d expect such performance on a far cheaper phone than this, it’s still worth noting.
There’s a wider selection of 5G bands this year thanks to a new 5G modem. If you’re in the USA then the iPhone 13 also supports mmWave 5G – a faster version of the tech that only really works when you’re very close to the masts. mmWave isn’t a thing in the UK, nor many other regions yet, so the tech is simply just missing from these iPhone models.
One very welcome change is the jump up to 128GB for the base model, doubling the previous 64GB model. There’s also 256GB (the one I’d recommend) and a 512GB option.
Battery life
Much better battery life than the iPhone 12Doesn’t come with a charging plugCan charge wired at 20w or wirelessly through MagSafe at 15w
Battery life has seen one of the biggest upgrades in the iPhone 13, and it’s been achieved through the inclusion of larger cells and a more efficient chipset.
Apple claims an extra two hours of video playback, and while this is something of a pointless metric unless you really do just stream video all day, I’ve found it does equate to a couple of extra hours of use before a charge is needed.
Throughout testing, I’ve been trying to deplete the phone’s battery in a day. I ran a looped video that took 21 hours for the battery to die (more than Apple’s claimed 19 hours) while streamed video lasted for 15 hours. An hour of Netflix streaming in HDR at 100% brightness consumed 9% (7%, with a more reasonable 75% brightness), while an hour of playing Sayonara Wild Hearts only took off 11%.
I’m not going to say this is the best battery life I have seen on a phone, but it’s certainly far better than the battery life I experienced with the iPhone 12. 
For charging, you’ll still need to provide your own plug (although a cable is included in the very slim box), or pick up either a MagSafe charger or another Qi-enabled pad. 
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
Apple might have switched to USB-C across its laptops and the majority of iPads, but it still uses Lightning for the iPhone. If you have plenty of iPhone accessories lying around then this is great; but USB-C is just so much faster for both data transfer and charging that it does feel like a miss.
Charging speeds will likely depend on the type of charger you’re using. All iPhone 13 models support up to 20W fast wired charging, and using this you’ll get to around 50% in half an hour.

Should you buy it?


You haven’t upgraded in a few years: The iPhone 13 takes all the iPhone 12’s great features and adds in a better camera, more video modes and far better battery life.


You want the fastest screen: If a 120Hz screen is on your list, then this isn’t the phone for you. We would suggest going for the iPhone 13 Pro instead.









Final Thoughts
The camera is the best at this price point; the display is great for HDR video, and I still absolutely love this design with its flat edges and smooth sides. The slightly smaller notch and the extra hit of brightness for outdoor viewing are welcome, too, although neither is particularly standout.
If you upgraded to the iPhone 12 last year and don’t have a yearly upgrade option then you’re not missing too much. The prospect of a ProMotion display and possible hole-punch camera cutout coming next year with the iPhone 14 should end up being more tempting.

Verdict































The Moto Edge 20 Lite on paper doesn’t bring as much to the table as the competition. But with a great HDR OLED screen, good battery life, strong performance and a charming software skin, it will reward anyone willing to take the plunge and pick it up. Sometimes a smartphone is all about experience, and this is one worth having.

Introduction
The concept of the ‘mid-range’ phone is relatively simple – take the best bits from the flagships of last year and build  handsets that deliver value without too many compromises. Though the niche has expanded in size and definition over time, this rule has mostly remained true.
In 2021, things are beginning to change however. With the Redmi Note 10 Pro, the Poco X3 Pro and the Poco F3, Xiaomi has placed former flagship components in low-cost phones to disruptive effect. What we might consider ‘budget’ is now markedly different than before, and new mid-range phones are concurrently facing an existential threat – does the ‘mid-range’ exist any more or is it too broad a definition?
Enter the Moto Edge 20 Lite, one of a new slate of releases from Motorola under Lenovo. It is intended as a mid-range phone, but it fits firmly at the lower-end of that segment. With a 90Hz OLED panel, a 108MP camera and a 5,000mAh battery, it has features that are each matched or bested by all of Xiaomi’s latest offerings, and at lower price points. 

The sole differentiator is the software experience provided by Motorola, how much of a difference does it make? Is it enough to thrive or even survive? Read on for our full thoughts.
Price and availability
The Moto Edge 20 Lite is available now directly from Motorola for prices beginning at £300/€369. Two colour options are available, Lagoon Green and Electric Graphite.
Design and screen – Plastic fantastic
Thick plastic designThe screen is flat and doesn’t curveA large distinctive camera bump on the rear
In the mid-range, no prizes are offered or expected for design. Phones produced are intended to be sturdy and to evoke the best premium qualities of flagship phones without costing quite as much. The Moto Edge 20 Lite fits somewhere inbetween the promise of quality versus the compromise of utilitarian durability. 

The handset is composed entirely of plastic, or to use a kinder term – polycarbonate (read ‘posh plastic’). From the rails to the rear, the device has not a hint of either glass or metal in sight, save of course for the front screen. This doesn’t mean that it doesn’t feel durable however, as it has both heft and presence in the hand and the body doesn’t flex too much when subjected to pressure.
An unsung bonus of plastic is its ability to bend, making it far more suitable for surviving the odd drop or fall when compared to the likes of glass or metal – handsets like the Edge 20 Lite are more likely to continue unscathed in the long term than many more premium options on the market today.
The power button/fingerprint sensor combo along with the volume rocker can be found on the right side. Although the placement of the sensor proved to be somewhat awkward in general use, it was never more than a mild annoyance, with it proving to be mostly accurate and fast. 

On the left side can be found the typical, unmappable ‘Google’ button, which most will press twice by accident before turning off entirely, and on the bottom there is a welcome 3.5mm headphone jack.
Found on the rear are a very subtle ‘Moto’ blazon and the camera island, which houses three separate sensors. The front sports the main display, along with a somewhat distracting silver ring around the pinhole selfie camera.
In all this isn’t a handset that will turn heads, especially in the boring ‘Electric Graphite’ colour which sports all the excitement of pencil lead, but that certainly doesn’t feel cheap or insubstantial. At 185g and 8.3mm thick however, it is definitely not for one handed use, this is an unapologetically large phone.
Where the design of the handset clearly didn’t eat up too much of the budget, the screen is another matter altogether. It is an 6.7 inch 1080p OLED panel, sporting “1 billion” colours, a 90Hz refresh rate and HDR certification, all of the numbers and specifications needed to fit in with the crowd.
These don’t do a service to it in general use. From movies to reading and gaming, this panel is a delight. Though the general white point may skew a little warm for most, I found it to be mostly colour accurate and bright enough to view on a day with strong sunlight. 

One criticism which could be levelled is the use of a 90Hz refresh rate while the competition are moving to 120Hz and above as a matter of course. Most will not notice the difference, 90Hz is an appreciable jump from 60Hz, and by choosing a lower refresh rate battery life is preserved and performance improved.
In all, the Moto Edge 20 Lite might note have the most technically advanced display available in the mid-range at the moment, but for all but the most dedicated of screen purists it will be more than enough.
Camera – More megapixels than sense
Four camera modules covering various focal lengthsMain sensor has 108MPA host of dedicated camera modes are available
It is an unfortunate development in recent years that the ‘megapixel wars’ have begun once again. Smartphone manufacturers are locked in an arms race with one another to produce the highest megapixel count, which doesn’t deliver much in the way of value to the consumer.

As phone sensors have gained more megapixels, the detail of the images captured hasn’t improved stratospherically. I was therefore skeptical of the Edge 20 Lite’s touted 108MP sensor and its ability to deliver decent results. 

Unfortunately, this cynicism was rewarded, the sensor on the Edge 20 Lite performs nowhere near the expectations set by the marketing. To begin, the 108MP label is quite misleading, as the sensor combines pixels by 9 for each shot produced, outputting 12MP images.

Photos produced have little detail, a result of heavy over-sharpening which is not too present on shots of buildings but highly noticeable in pictures with foliage. White balance is in general accurate, however shots did tend to either under or over-expose without finding an acceptable middle ground, showcasing a lack of dynamic range. 

In low-light the pictures were a little better, with decent colour but again little detail to offer. The included ultra-wide sensor suffered from all the same issues as above, though compounded due to the smaller sensor used, while the Macro sensor proved to be next to useless.

Being able to take macro photos is generally accepted as a benefit, however when the reality is dependent on staying steady with the phone 2cm from the subject, achieving usable results is an almost impossible task.
The bad impressions extend to the camera app, which is clunky and slow to use. Starting the app takes quite a long time, and then locking focus adds seconds more, as such for those looking to photograph either a pet or a toddler we would recommend looking elsewhere.
Moving between modes then proves to take longer than it should, while many of the ‘fun’ options (such as a ‘Spot Colour’) mode are hidden in settings. In all it feels sparse, minimal and poorly optimised, which is unfortunate. 


This isn’t to say that in good light, with a static subject, the Moto Edge 20 Lite cannot achieve good images, for it certainly can, however it performs well below expectations in almost every way when compared to the competition.
Performance – Can keep up with most
Runs a Mediatek Dimensity 720Comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage by defaultRuns cool for the most part
Mediatek processors have never achieved quite the fame or success of their Qualcomm peers. Although they have been used in many handsets, their presence has typically been taken as the hallmark of a ‘budget’ phone, delivering neither performance or efficiency.
The Moto Edge 20 Lite is a thankful exception to this story. Backed up by 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the Dimensity 720 SoC manages to easily power through most every day tasks without breaking a sweat. Whether simply navigating through the interface or using more intensive apps we found little could faze it, never experiencing a slowdown across the review period. 

This wasn’t quite the case when attempting to play the likes of PUBG on High detail settings, however this troubles even higher end handsets. The picture painted here is backed up by Geekbench 5 testing, which saw the handset achieve a single core score of 506 and a multi-core score of 1623. Neither of these are enough to trouble the big boys, but place the handset firmly in the middle of the mid-range, scoring more than devices with the Snapdragon 730 in general.
Where the Moto Edge 20 Lite really has an opportunity to stand out from the crowd is with its software. Starting with the original Moto X in 2013, the company has offered its own flavour of Android with multiple quality of life inclusions in tow. These include the well-known ‘double karate-chop’ to activate the torch, and a double wrist-twist to call up the camera. There are multiple such inclusions peppered throughout the software, which offer thoughtful improvements on the stock Android experience. 

Despite this, it isn’t a heavy skin, being mostly stock in appearance and a far cry from the likes of MIUI on Xiaomi devices, there is no feature bloat or incomprehensible menu system here. 
Though it isn’t enough to sell the device by itself, the software system is certainly enough of a reason to pick up Motorola over the competition, and adds considerable charm to the experience of using the handset overall.
An unfortunate element is the admission from Motorola that the handset will only receive a limited number of software updates across the course of its life. As Samsung and Nokia are promising upwards of three years of support, this limits the longevity of the Moto significantly and may reduce its appeal as a result..
Battery life – Will last a full day, sometimes two
5000mAh batteryCapable of 30W fast chargingComes with a fast charger in the box
Where it used to once be something worthy of note, in the mid-range/budget segment now having a 5,000mAh battery is now de rigueur. The Moto Edge 20 Lite follows suit, offering such a pack along with 30W fast charging.
Although a big battery is an important ingredient in good battery life, it isn’t the only one. An efficient processor and software are also necessary, and luckily the Moto Edge 20 Lite has both. 

On an average day, with around 16 hours of messaging, calls, email, browsing, streaming music, playing games and watching video, we managed around 6 hours and 30 minutes consistently before hitting 20% battery.
With lighter usage, it will be possible to extend the battery into a second day and for most people this will be a phone they will never be able to kill with a single day of use.
The included 30W fast charging ability is welcome, as is the charger in the box, however the competition, especially that from Realme, offer far faster speeds. This will be useful in a pinch, we managed to recharge around 45% in 30 minutes on average, however it isn’t the best such option available.

Should you buy it?


You watch a lot of movies on your phone: The phone offers solid battery life, a good for the money screen and solid build quality.


You want the best performance: The Lite isn’t the fastest phone and it also doesn’t feature the best camera you’ll find at this price.









Final Thoughts
Making a successful mid-range smartphone has never been an easy task, and that has never been the case more than before. With a proliferation of budget handsets stealing their thunder, it has been increasingly difficult to justify spend more on a handset that only offers the same rather than more.
The Motorola Edge 20 Lite won’t change this. It is a phone that is handily outclassed by the competition on most fronts on the spec sheet, and for those who need the absolute best in any one area, it will be best to look elsewhere. 
But for those who do end up buying one, the Edge 20 Lite is a highly likeable smartphone with much to offer, including a great screen, strong battery life, good performance and helpful software. It isn’t the shot in the arm the segment needed, but it is a worthy inclusion nonetheless.

HDR
																HDR stands for High Dynamic Range and refers to contrast (or difference) between the brightest and darkest parts of an image. HDR content preserves details in the darkest and brightest areas of a picture, details that are often lost in old imaging standards. HDR10 is mandated to be included on all HDR TVs. It’s also supported by 4K projectors.
															

HDR10+
																HDR10+ is a HDR variant created by 20th Century Fox, Panasonic and Samsung as a free to use, open platform alternative to Dolby Vision.

Verdict


































Motorola makes some compromises here and there to accommodate a 5x pericope zoom camera in the Edge 20 Pro. But if you’ve been waiting some time for a somewhat affordable phone to push this particular area of camera tech, you’re in luck. Just make sure you’re happy with the few things it doesn’t do quite as well first.

Introduction
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro is the most expensive Motorola phone most of you should consider buying. Yes, that is throwing shade on the Motorola Razr 5G. 
It costs £649, which is half the price of the true God-tier Androids, but Motorola has done its best to cram in almost every core feature present in those phones. 
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro is slim, comes with a fast processor, a 5x zoom camera and can even record 8K video. It includes 256GB storage, too, when mid-price favourites such as the OnePlus 9 demand upwards of £700 for that upgrade.
You get a great spread of features in the Motorola Edge 20 Pro. However, it doesn’t act as a benchmark in any of them. Rivals offer better speakers, faster processors, brighter screens, fancier fingerprint scanners and cameras with better processing or superior low-light image quality.
So is the Motorola Edge 20 Pro a dud? Absolutely not. Motorola has simply chosen to downgrade slightly in a few areas, rather than cutting out features altogether, as you often see in other phones at the price. I’ll cover all the omissions in this review, but whether or not this phone belongs on your shortlist will depend largely on how much you want a “superzoom” 5x magnification camera.

Design
The Edge 20 Pro has a sleek design, by Motorola standardsIt offers very basic water resistance It has a side facing fingerprint reader
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro is one of the few Motorola phones that doesn’t feel somewhat chubby. The company’s entire G-series line comprises phones that are 9mm thick or more.
It’s a Motorola trait, one I’m always happy to ignore considering the phones come with reasonably large 5000mAh batteries. The Motorola Edge 20 Pro design is a little more elegant, however.
This phone has a depth of 8mm, so feels slim without the bundled silicone case in which I’ve used it 90% of the time. It’s also one of the few Motorola phones that isn’t largely made of plastic, and doesn’t use a cheaper alternative to Corning’s Gorilla Glass for the display protection.

The Motorola Edge 20 Pro screen glass is Gorilla Glass 5, and the rear an unspecified “3D” glass, which means it curves at the sides. However, like so many phones in this class, it isn’t a full metal and glass construction. The sides are plastic.
I haven’t noticed this too much, what with the silicone case in place much of the time, but it does make the Motorola Edge 20 Pro feel noticeably less expensive than a device such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus.
Still, things have shifted enough over the past 2-3 years for a part-plastic £650 phone to seem entirely normal nowadays.
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro offers basic water-resistance, too. It’s rated at IP52, which means it’s protected against dust, but is only rated to withstand rain and other water drips. This water resistance is similar to the “nano” coatings of other Motorola phones.
Style-wise, the Motorola Edge 20 Pro fine. It isn’t as distinctive as Samsung’s S21-series Android, but the matte finish on the rear glass is pleasant enough. Much like every other mainstream Motorola phone of this year, you get a sense that style hasn’t been a priority.

You’re likely to notice a couple of cost-saving measures to the outer hardware, too. The Motorola Edge 20 Pro has only one speaker, which sits along the bottom edge of the phone – but it delivers good volume. Some alternative devices come with stereo arrays, and slightly meatier sound.
In addition, the Edge 20 Pro’s fingerprint scanner sits on the side of the phone, not inside the screen. In-screen scanners are regarded as the slickest way to unlock a phone these days; but this pad is fast and reliable. A few days in, I wasn’t left wishing the Motorola Edge 20 Pro had an in-screen scanner. The placement of the pad is a little high, but still a good ergonomic fit for my hands.
The phone also has a Google Assistant button. These are often quite annoying, and have a habit of accidentally being pushed down in your pocket, waking up the assistant. Motorola has done its best to fix the problem by pushing the button way up the left side of the phone, and using a much stiffer mechanism. It works: I don’t think the Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s Google Assistant has been engaged once by accident. It’s a smart and thoughtful little design tweak.

Display
It has the best display seen on a Motorola phone this yearThe high refresh rate panel is great for gaming
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro has a 6.7-inch Full HD OLED screen, making it the best panel you can get in a 2021 Motorola phone.
A 144Hz refresh rate is its most eye-catching feature. Other phones may have 90Hz or 120Hz screens, but this one is even “faster”. I don’t think this is a real draw, though. Refresh rates this high may be great for super-powered gaming PCs or laptops, but I don’t see any obvious benefit over the more common 120Hz in a phone.
Let’s get real: Motorola has used a 144Hz panel here because it found one it could source at a reasonable cost.

It’s a solid OLED display. There’s only a slight blue tint when it’s viewed from an angle, contrast is perfect, and you have a choice of two colour modes. Saturated seems to be based on the native colour of the panel, so looks quite oversaturated. Natural is more reserved, and appears better to my eyes.
Ultra-high brightness is the one missing piece, but what you do get isn’t bad at all. The Motorola Edge 20 Pro reaches around 450 nits indoors, rising to 650 nits when in direct sunlight, using the Adaptive Brightness mode.
While this isn’t as high as the 1000-plus nits seen in some top-end phones, I do find it bright enough to comfortably take photos outdoors on a sunny day.

The use of an OLED panel also allows for the classic Motorola software add-on feature, a screen that pops up when the Motorola Edge 20 Pro is sleeping and is either moved or on a notification coming in. Per-pixel lighting means it uses relatively little battery, where an LCD would have to light the entire screen.
Software and Performance
It has a wonderfully clean Android installThere are basic motion controls for things like activating the flashlightIt offers speed performance and 5G connectivity
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro runs an extremely clean version of Android 11. Motorola only puts one substantive app on here, called Moto, and this controls the little extras added to an interface that could pass for totally vanilla Android.
Anyone familiar with Moto-series phones may have experienced these before. Peek display, the lock-screen feature already mentioned, is the top addition. There are also shortcut gestures that can be enabled and disabled separately.
Two karate chops toggle the torch. You can touch the screen with three fingers to grab a screenshot, or twist the Motorola Edge 20 Pro twice quickly to start the camera. Motorola leaves most of these disabled as standard to avoid annoying accidental use.

I have no complaints about the software. There’s virtually no “bloat” to the preinstalled apps. And even if there were, the 256GB storage means you’re basically complaining about being annoyed by extra icons on the screen.
If you want to complain about the Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s power, there’s a better argument to make. This phone has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 5G processor.
It’s effectively a tweaked version of last year’s Snapdragon 865-series chipset. The manufacturing process isn’t as advanced as the newer Snapdragon 888s, and its graphics chipset isn’t as powerful. If you want as much power as you can get for your money, check out the OnePlus 9 or Realme GT 5G. Those phones have the Snapdragon 888, and the Realme is a good deal cheaper.
However, I’m a fan of the Snapdragon 870, and the cheaper Snapdragon 860. Both get you flagship-grade performance, and let phone makers put more of their budget into other areas of a phone.
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s Snapdragon 870 destroys 7-series chipsets such as the brilliant Snapdragon 765G and 750G for gaming. In 3DMark’s Wildlife benchmark, the Edge scores 4262 points. While this is around 20% lower than the score you could expect from a Snapdragon 888 phone, it’s more than double the score of the OnePlus Nord, which features a Snapdragon 765G – and that phone already does a serviceable job with top-end games.

Fortnite runs very well with its graphics and resolution slider maxed. Epic Games doesn’t let you try out its 60fps mode, available in some phones, but the way the Motorola Edge 20 Pro seems to stick to 30fps aside from brief dips when new textures are loaded suggests it could achieve frame rates in excess of 30fps much of the time.
Similar to the OnePlus Nord 2 5G and its Dimensity 12000 5G chipset, while the Motorola Edge 20 Pro may not come with the most powerful processor around, it’s worth questioning whether you’ll actually notice or appreciate the difference. Some will, many won’t.
Camera
The phone has a triple sensor rear camera setupIt offers 5x optical zoomCamera quality is excellent for a phone this price
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro has three cameras, and one of them is this phone’s star feature.
Up at the top sits a 5x optical zoom with folded pericope optics. This means a 45-angled mirror diverts light by 90 degrees onto a sensor that sits perpendicular to the phone’s back, not parallel with it.
These kinds of camera must be expensive to produce, because you only tend to see them on very high-price phones. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is probably the best example today. It has a 10x periscope zoom, and a 3x non-folded one.

The Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s isn’t quite as good, but it’s the most powerful zoom I’ve used at this price to date. It’s great for gig photography, or those moments you find something interesting in the distance to shoot, only to find it looks hopelessly small through a “standard” camera view.
This zoomed camera is a little slower to use than the other two, with a little focus and shutter lag. But it’s still easy and fun to use, and has OIS. This stabilises the lens so you can take sharp images handheld. A 5x lens magnifies the effect of natural hand movement. OIS is pretty much essential at this focal length.
This is my favourite part of the Motorola Edge 20 Pro camera. No contest. But you should also approach it with realistic expectations.
The camera uses a tiny 1/4-inch Omnivision 8-megapixel sensor and a narrow aperture f/3.4 lens. Its native light sensitivity is poor compared to a good 1x zoom phone camera. Even the most expensive superzoom phones have to deal with comparable compromises, but I find they affect image quality more often here.
Good luck trying to get gig photos as clear as this, from far back in the crowd, with other £600 phones
A slight increase in ISO – the sensitivity setting that cameras use to contend with lesser light – results in a swift drop in detail. And if you’re capturing a moving object, such as a duck on a pond, it had better be in bright conditions. 
Low native sensitivity means the 5x camera will only use a truly fast shutter speed if there’s plentiful light in a scene. The Edge 20 Pro zoom also has a tendency to mush some foliage detail, even in perfect lighting. I can’t quite tell whether this is the result of exposure merging, used to improve dynamic range, or the image processing identifying its detail as noise and smudging it. But it happens.
Even tree cover can cause ISO sensitivity to raise, resulting in soft or fuzzed-out detail
Some will argue a 3x zoom would be more useful. If you’re in that crowd, check out the cheaper Motorola Edge 20, which comes with a 3x zoom. But I’m a fan of these extended zooms. I find they make me think a bit more deeply about the kind of shot I could get with a phone, rather than just pulling the device out when I spot a scene that looks nice based on what my eyes see in that moment.

The Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s other two rear cameras are a 108-megapixel standard view cam and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide.
Our main camera has a Samsung HM2 sensor, a fairly large and powerful chip. However, it doesn’t capture any more detail than the 12-megapixel Pixel 4a 5G; less in some cases. Like most high-resolution phones it actually creates 12-megapixel shots as standard. There’s an Ultra Resolution mode that creates 108-megapixel files, but using this mode usually isn’t the best idea since dynamic range is worse. While brightly lit areas of fine detail may look clearer, areas in shadow are often less detailed or flat-out fuzzy.
Blown-out sun higlights, red flare: two returning issues of the Motorola Edge 20 Pro camera
The primary camera here isn’t as good as the units that feature in the Pixel 4a 5G or OnePlus Nord 2 5G, in my opinion. Blown highlights are far more common here. Earthy browns often take a turn towards purple, an effect I’ve seen in other Motorola phones. Pretty much every sunset-style photo I’ve taken with the Motorola Edge 20 Pro has a big, red lens-flare splotch on it, and cleaning the lens doesn’t appear to help in this case.
Some of these issues are the result of Motorola’s processing. The flare is down to the lens. But the Samsung HM2 sensor’s presence in the much cheaper Realme 8 Pro suggests this is a budget-friendly chip.

I just haven’t been able to take as many pictures with the Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s camera that I’m actually happy with, as opposed to shots from the OnePlus Nord 2 5G or Pixel 4a 5G – although, on occasion, I can get the result I’m after by a quick Photoshop edit. This doesn’t apply to the Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s night photography, however.
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro does have a Night Vision mode, but it just doesn’t stack up well next to 2021’s top mid-range performers. Sure, it brightens up a scene, firms up detail and reintroduces colour absent from the “auto” mode photos you shoot at night. But it doesn’t provide the dramatic dynamic range and shadow detail improvement that’s beginning to drop down to phones at £400 or even below, perhaps originally spearheaded by the Pixel 4a.
Night photo quality okay, but not great by 2021 standards
My expectations for the Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s 16-megapixel ultra-wide were much lower, so there are no such disappointments here. I think it’s a fine wide, with slightly better image quality than plenty of lower-mid-range Androids. When reviewing images on my MacBook, I’ve had to check the aperture to see whether it was shot with the 1x or 0.5x lens: a good sign. And I find the ultra-wide’s colour tone more consistent than that of the primary camera.
Primary camera: red flare, and the HDR could be pushed further
Ultra-wide camera: hey presto, no red flare
It’s a useful secondary field of view but, of course, the OnePlus 9’s quite brilliant 50-megapixel ultra-wide does make it look pretty bad. Still, that phone has the same effect on many rivals.
There are plenty of ups and downs with the Motorola Edge 20 Pro camera. An unusually potent zoom with expected compromises. Powerful-sounding main camera that doesn’t quite come up with the goods. As seen elsewhere, Motorola offers a breadth of features without entirely nailing the fundamentals. 
My wording of some of this is perhaps slightly harsh. The phone’s three cameras are all decent, but the Motorola Edge 20 Pro isn’t quite the mid-range camera king I was hoping for on seeing the 5x zoom. 

Video features are comprehensive. You can shoot detailed 8K video with a cropped view, although this footage isn’t stabilised, so I’d advise sticking to 4K capture unless you can use a tripod. Slo-mo offers up to 240fps at 1080p resolution, and this is supported by the sensor itself. As such, there’s no reason to suspect Motorola uses frame interpolation, where additional frames are created to make up the numbers.
The 32-megapixel selfie camera uses an Omnivision sensor, just like the ultra-wide and 5x zoom, and it offers fair-quality selfies. Detail is very good in bright lighting, but its pixel-binning technique doesn’t seem effective enough to avoid pictures turning stodgy indoors or poor lighting. You can, however, use the Night Vision mode for selfies, which improves matters significantly.
Battery life
It has a smaller battery than most phones this priceBut still offers decent battery life
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s battery is smaller than that included in most Motorola phones. Its a 4500mAh battery, where most of the cheaper Moto-series phones come with a 5000mAh.
A smaller battery, larger screen, more powerful processor and 144Hz refresh rate sounds like a bad combo, right? However, I’m perfectly happy with the Motorola Edge 20 Pro’s longevity, and find it tends to outlast several of the true flagship phones I’ve used over the past 12 months with the same or similar battery capacity.

While the Motorola Edge 20 Pro has never lasted two days with my typical use, which involves above average podcast streaming and occasional deep dives into YouTube and harmless subreddits, I’ve never had to top it up to see it last until midnight.
Note that Motorola’s battery reporting seems to be slightly different to the norm. Even on heavier-use days, when it may be down to 40% by the early evening – which has happened a couple of times – the Motorola Edge 20 Pro has held onto that last tranche of charge way longer than I expect.
You get one solid to fairly heavy day of use from the Motorola Edge 20 Pro. That’s not the near-two days achievable from the Moto G50, but it isn’t a bad result considering the phone is thinner and much more powerful.
The handset’s OLED screen may play a part here. An hour of streamed video consumes just 6% of the charge level, although I tend to find real-world battery life is largely determined by battery capacity and the manufacturer’s software layer’s approach to background processes – if you’re dealing with similar-generation hardware.
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro offers 30W charging, and comes with a 30W charger in the box, unlike a charger-free Samsung Galaxy S21. This isn’t the fastest you can get at the price, beaten by the OnePlus 9’s 65W, for example. However, it’s reasonably quick, taking 31 minutes to reach 50%, from a battery so drained the phone won’t switch on. A full charge takes 1hr 25mins.

Should you buy it?


You want a reasonably affordable “superzoom” phone Handsets with a 5x zoom camera at this price are rare, and this lens is great for gig photography and nature shots when you can’t get too close to the subject. Some cuts are made elsewhere to include such hardware, but most don’t impact on day-to-day to a detrimental level.


You expect perfection everywhere The Motorola Edge 20 Pro may be a bit of a zoom master, but it isn’t an all-round photography pro. Other phones at this price and cheaper offer better HDR and low-light photography. You also need to be able to accept the mono speaker, and while the Snapdragon 870 CPU may be great, it isn’t on a par with the Snapdragon 888 offered by some alternatives with a slightly narrower feature focus.










Final Thoughts
The Motorola Edge 20 Pro is no also-ran mid-range phone. It’s one of the few sub-£1000 Android devices with a pericope zoom, which opens up the possibility of taking images that are beyond almost all of its rivals.
If that sounds great, you should consider the Motorola Edge 20 Pro. If, having read the review, you’re left wondering why you’d want a 5x zoom in a phone, then this probably isn’t the device for you. 
It doesn’t nail some other aspects of photography quite as well as the very best sub-£650 Android phones, and if you’re happy to forego the great zoom then you can pick up a handset with an even more powerful CPU. Motorola has played the budget balancing act pretty well here in my opinion, but that it isn’t at the forefront of camera image processing shows up quite keenly in a phone at this level.

FAQs
Is the Motorola Edge 20 Pro waterproof? The phone has basic IP52 water/dust-resistance. It’s enough for rain, but not much more than that.  Does the Motorola Edge 20 Pro have a headphone jack? There’s no 3.5mm jack here so you’ll need to use a USB-C adapter or wireless headphones.   Does the Motorola Edge 20 Pro offer fast-charging? A 30W adapter gives the phone mid-speed fast-charging, which gets you to 50% in around 30 minutes.

Introduction
The Motorola Edge 20 is another phone to enter the mid-market fray, offering a classy design, capable performance, and an unusually rapid display for £430.
These are shark-infested waters in which Motorola is choosing to swim, with the OnePlus Nord 2 and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G making strong statements for slightly less money in recent months. The Poco F3, meanwhile, costs a good £100 less. 
If anyone knows how to make an impressively well-rounded phone for a limited budget, however, it’s Motorola. With a fresh design language and one or two stand-out components, the Edge 20 is out to impress. 

Design and Screen
Curiously edge-less metal-and-plastic designOnly Gorilla Glass 3 and no IP rating 6.7-inch AMOLED with 144Hz refresh rate
Motorola has lost its edge with the Motorola Edge 20. Quite literally. The original 2020 version of the Motorola Edge was so-named because of its pronounced dual-curved display, but there’s no sign of it here.
Its successor is as flat as a pancake, and almost as thin at 7mm, with not so much as a hint of a curve to its display. Motorola calls it a “2.5D” screen, but that seems like a rather creative use of the term.
This isn’t a criticism of Motorola’s approach, though. The general trend seems to be away from impractically curved displays, and the Moto Edge 20 feels more usable day to day as a result of the shift. It’s incredibly light for its size, too, at just 163g. 
The phone’s aluminum edges – by no means a common provision at this price – are also flat, combining to make it feel somewhat like a wider, less premium Sony Xperia 1 III. Talking of those edges, Motorola has positioned its power button (complete with reliable integrated fingerprint sensor) unusually high on the right edge. That has a knock-on effect for the volume rocker, which feels ludicrously high.
Similarly, on the left edge, there’s a small Google Assistant button that feels so high that I frequently forgot it was even there. That might be something to do with the lack of basic utility, and it’s a shame this button isn’t customisable in the otherwise useful Moto app.

While the Edge 20’s body is metal, the rear panel is plastic – or PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), to be precise. This is a transparent synthetic resin that’s often used to replace glass in shatter-proof windows. It doesn’t feel cheap, though, thanks to a shimmering-matte finish (if that isn’t too much of a contradiction) that gives the impression of glass. 
Our model is the fairly unpromising-sounding Frosted Grey, but it picks up flashes of surrounding colours depending on how you angle it. More generally, it sometimes looks stealthy and black, and at others almost blue.
The front of the phone shows faint signs of compromise other than that lack of a physical edge. Motorola has gone with Gorilla Glass 3 in its construction, which is quite an old standard now. More broadly, there’s no IP rating here either, with Motorola only confirming that the Edge 20 design is “water-repellent”.
I may have mis-spoken when I likened the Edge 20 to a pancake just then. I dare say no combination of flour, eggs, and milk has ever rocked and clattered around on a flat surface quite so disconcertingly. That’s down to a two-tiered camera module – three, if you include the phone’s pronounced camera lenses – positioned in the top-left corner of the rear panel, which leaves the handset feeling unusually precarious when you lay it down.
While the Motorola Edge 20’s design is a little prosaic, its display is quite eye-catching. It’s a 6.7-inch AMOLED that gets reasonably bright. I recorded it as hitting 483 nits in its default Saturated colour setting, and 408 in Natural. The latter is far more colour-accurate, however, yielding a white point of 6477K.

Natural mode also supplies solid, if unspectacular, colour gamut coverage of 98.1% sRGB, 70.8% Adobe RGB, and 72.9% DCI-P3. That isn’t quite up there with flagship efforts from Apple, OnePlus and Samsung, but it’s still decent.
More impressive than these basic metrics is the Motorola Edge 20 display’s refresh rate. At a time where some £400 phones still offer 90Hz (the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G) and even 60Hz (the Sony Xperia 10 III) displays, the Edge 20 goes all in with a 144Hz offering.
Is this a noticeable improvement over the 120Hz refresh rate used by most flagship phones? No, it doesn’t really feel like an improvement at all, but it does feel nice and smooth. You’ll have to turn this provision on, however, since the Auto mode will only increase the refresh rate up to 120Hz when the situation calls for it. 
Which kind of reinforces my suspicion that the 144Hz is a bit of a headline-grabbing gimmick here. True, there are gaming phones that offer this spec. But they’re in the minority for a reason, and they at least have the top-level processing power and specific use-case scenario to justify such an inclusion.
Camera
108MP main sensor16MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto Strong shots in good lighting, weak in low-light and night conditions
Unlike with last year’s Edge lineup, Motorola has brought a 108-megapixel sensor to the entire Edge 20 range, not just the top model – which is called the Pro this year, rather than the Plus. 

That 108-megapixel image sensor has been making its way into a lot of mid-range phones in 2021, with generally decent results. Once again, it utilises a pixel-binning technique to produce brighter shots. In this case that translates to a 9-in-1 process, which yields 12-megapixel “Ultra Pixel” shots.
In strong lighting, some of the shots I obtained were fabulous. On a sunny day, several close-up shots of flowers and plants were genuinely excellent, packed full of colour and detail. 

Motorola’s auto-HDR facility did well to balance out some awkward exposure scenarios, too, such as bright skies over a clump of shady trees or a dingy old church.

As the light levels dropped, however, so did the quality of the images captured – sometimes, quite alarmingly. Whether it’s the lack of OIS playing a part or an image processing deficiency, reasonably lit indoors shots became noisy and indistinct. Night mode shots, meanwhile, packed lots of disconcerting grain, despite being reasonably bright.

The 16-megapixel ultra-wide sensor isn’t anything to write home about, but it’s competent – and that’s not always something you can guarantee at this price. Its tone is noticeably warmer than that of the main/wide sensor, and detail is worse. It’s an adequate provision, but nothing more. 
1x zoom
2x zoom
There’s also an 8-megapixel telephoto sensor. On the negative side, it isn’t massively sharp. On the positive side, it sports a deeper-than-usual 3x zoom lens, which opens up the possibility of some genuinely fresh framing. Unlike the main sensor, it also benefits from OIS. 
Selfie camera
Selfie camera in Portrait mode
A 32-megapixel selfie camera seems to be pretty good on paper, but it isn’t too hot in practice. I observed bags of grain and purple fringing, while the selfie Portrait mode smudged out an alarming amount of edge detail, giving me an even more ghostly appearance than usual.
Performance 
Capable Snapdragon 778G processor 8GB of RAM and 128/256GB of storage Light, near-stock Android 11 
The Motorola Edge 20 runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 778G processor, which is a very similar chip to the Snapdragon 780G that proved so impressive in the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G.
It’s a partial downgrade on that chip, but this amounts to a simple production switch from Samsung’s 5nm processor to TSMC’s slightly less efficient 6nm node. When you really get down to it, this is yet another punchy mid-range chip that isn’t too far off the standard of a 2020 flagship, backed by a strong 8GB of RAM.

An average Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 2768 falls around 150 short of the aforementioned Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G, and is almost identical to the OnePlus Nord 2 with its speedy Dimensity 1200-AI processor. It falls about 600 short of the Poco F3, which continues to rule the mid-range performance roost with its Snapdragon 870 chip.
In general navigation, the Motorola Edge 20 feels fast and smooth. That Snapdragon 778G is more than capable of driving the phone’s rapid 144Hz display, and we didn’t pick up on any real pauses when opening and flitting between apps.
In the 3DMark Wild Life GPU test, the Motorola Edge 20 scores 2481. That’s well short of the OnePlus Nord 2’s 4226 and the Poco F3 on around 4100. If you’re after mid-range gaming performance, the Edge 20 isn’t quite in the same league as those two rivals.
Sure enough, Genshin Impact defaults to Low graphical settings, where the two aforementioned rivals will default to Medium. That said, it did remain quite smooth and playable on High, bar the odd pause.
Any dedicated gamers on a budget should probably look elsewhere for their gaming kicks. No only do the OnePlus Nord 2 and the Poco F3 offer faster performance, they also both have stereo speakers, which the Edge 20 lacks. 
You’re well-catered for on the internal storage front here, with either 128GB or 256GB on offer. There’s also a microSD slot, which is a welcome provision.
That internal storage isn’t the fastest we’ve seen in this class, however. We recorded a read speed of 629MB/s and a write speed of 180MB/s, which is half and a third of the speed of the OnePlus Nord 2 respectively. 

Motorola’s light take on Android is always welcome. This is Android 11, pure and simple, with minimal customisation. As usual, Motorola adds its own Moto app, which bundles all its thoughtful little tweaks and additions into one brightly presented interface. 
You can access things like Moto Gestures here, which lets you execute a double-twist to open the camera, a double-chop to start the torch up, and other smart shortcuts. 
It’s predominantly positive on the software front, but there are a few annoyances. Motorola’s stock tones are rather obnoxious, although of course these can all be altered. Its icons also feel a little chunky to my eyes, although that too can be changed through the Home settings menu.
Battery life 
Decent stamina despite small 4000mAh battery30W charging No wireless charging 
The Motorola Edge 20 packs a 4000mAh battery, which is rather small for a modern mid-range smartphone. Both the OnePlus Nord 2 and the Poco F3 come with 4500mAh units, and even the svelte Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G manages 4250mAh.
With that said, the Motorola Edge 20’s stamina is perfectly competent. A long 16-hour day of moderate use (around 4 hours’ screen-on time) would typically leave me with around 40% in the tank – and this was with the screen refresh rate locked to 144Hz, rather than the more efficient Auto mode default.
An hour of Amazon Prime video streaming, with the screen set to 144Hz and full brightness, lost 10% of a charge. That’s comparable with the OnePlus Nord 2 (9%), but much worse than the similarly priced Sony Xperia 10 III. The latter is a much less impressive runner all round, however.

When it comes to recharging, you get a 30W TurboCharger bundled in. That’s roughly comparable to the Poco F3 and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G (both with 33W), but way behind the impressive OnePlus Nord 2 (65W).
It’s still reasonably fast, with a 0 to 50% recharge time of around 25 minutes, and 0 to 100% in around an hour. But the OnePlus can hit those marks in around half the time.
There’s no wireless charging provision here, but that’s not at all unusual in the £400 category.

Should you buy it?


You want the smoothest screen possible for less than £500 There aren’t many phones that offer a screen refresh rate in excess of 120Hz. The Motorola goes up to 144Hz. 
You want a dead-flat design Unlike the original Edge, and many of the Edge 20’s rivals, you’re getting a curve-less design here.


You’re not prepared to rock The Motorola Edge 20’s large, tiered camera module makes it very unstable when you lay it down on a flat surface. 
You’re a committed gamer The Motorola Edge 20 can handle games well, but it falls behind the OnePlus Nord 2 and the Poco F3 for raw graphical output, and it doesn’t have stereo speakers.









Final Thoughts
The Motorola Edge 20 has lost some of the classy appeal of its predecessor, and feels rather less special as a result. But it applies its resources quite well, with a healthy performance bump, a sharp 108-megapixel camera, and an atypically fluid 144Hz display. It’s design needs some work, and you undoubtedly miss out on a few little quality-of-life features such as stereo speakers. Camera performance falls off quite dramatically with the light, too. Ultimately, the Motorola Edge 20 isn’t quite as complete a mid-range package as the OnePlus Nord 2. It also lacks the raw performance and sheer outstanding value of the Poco F3. But it’s a composed and worthwhile alternative, with relatively few rough edges.

Introduction
With the Galaxy Z Flip 3, Samsung has finally made a foldable clamshell phone that can be taken seriously.
It has taken a couple of attempts, but Samsung’s latest line of foldable phones finally have a clear reason to exist. While the Z Fold 3 might get the ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ due to its futuristic look, the retro charm of the Z Flip 3 surely gives it the tag as the most unique phone of 2021.
It’s also the most fun I’ve had reviewing a phone all year. While I don’t think it quite takes foldables into the mainstream (that could happen in 2022), it’s certainly the easiest device like this to recommend to the mainstream audience.
Design and Screen
The improved outer display is useful nowStronger aluminium bodyIt’s now IPX8 rated for water resistance
Samsung hasn’t made any particularly sweeping changes for the third iteration of its modern clamshell phone, instead tweaking and tuning lots of smaller bits. This bevvy of changes makes for a far better phone.
The hefty price drop is also important. The sub £1000/$1000 price point is still, of course, very expensive. However, it’s not too dissimilar to phones such as the iPhone 12 Pro or Galaxy S21 Plus. This takes the Flip 3 out of the luxury market and makes it far more accessible to those who would typically spend big on an iPhone.
Since Samsung’s first Fold device was heavily delayed after durability issues, the strength and long-term viability of these devices had been called into question. I’ve been using the Z Flip 3 solidly as my main phone for over a week now, which is enough to give a general overview but not enough time to see if it can survive over a long 24-month contract.

To try and up the Z Flip 3’s durability, Samsung has changed a number of things. There’s a stronger coating over the ultra-thin glass display; Gorilla Glass Victus on the outside and tougher ‘Armor’ aluminium around the sides. It does feel more rigid than before and while it’s still delicate (you get a pretty hefty warning when you first boot it up), I’d have hope it’ll last.
The stronger covering layer – basically a fancy screen protector you won’t want to take off – is a big deal in a number of ways. It’s not as smudgy as before and far less prone to picking up dings. After a week of use, the screen is still perfectly clear.
Arguably the biggest durability improvement is the IPX8 rating. That ‘X’ portion means it’s not resistant to dust, but the ‘8’ means it’s finally water resistant – the first foldable to pack this feature.

I’ve been completely taken with the look and feel of the Z Flip 3. The clamshell design makes it immensely pocketable and oozes nostalgia. Snapping it shut to end a call remains consistently satisfying, while having such a small closed device has made me use the phone less – which is very much a good thing.
While the previous Z Flip had a virtually useless outer display, the Z Flip 3 has a 1.9-inch display that uses four times the space of before. This display can show the time, upcoming calendar appointments, a couple of recent notifications, alarms and the like. It can also act as a quirky little viewfinder for the camera. 
It’s not quite as practical as the outer display on the Moto Razr that lets you basically use any app, but it remains a big improvement.

Flip the phone open and it becomes a lot less miniature. The 6.7-inch inner display is one of the tallest around, making it ideal for scrolling through social feeds but less so for navigating with one hand.
Bang in the middle of the very smooth 120hz 1080p OLED panel is a crease. This divet in the display is noticeable when you’re scrolling and it does remain one of the biggest drawbacks of foldable tech. I don’t mind it as much here as I do on the large Fold devices though, and it is easy enough to ignore.

The screen itself is better this time around, too, especially in terms of brightness levels. I recorded a brightness of just below the quoted 900 nits, which is ideal for outdoor viewing.
Performance
Speedy performance thanks to the Snapdragon 888No microSD, so choose either 128 or 256GB wiselyOnly one RAM option – 8GB
The Z Flip 3 is an interesting phone as it doesn’t really sell itself on being the fastest, most powerful or having the best camera. The uniqueness of the design and the fantastic way it has been implemented allows for a focus away from simply stating speed improvements.
But, of course, this is still a near £1000/$1000 phone, and certain expectations must be met. There’s a Snapdragon 888 at the heart of the Z Flip 3, available in whatever region you buy it in, as well as 8GB RAM. It benchmarks as well as any other high-end Android phone and is a capable gaming device, even if the aspect ratio isn’t ideal for such tasks.
The previous default storage of 256GB has been sliced in half – likely to save extra costs – and you’ll have to pay extra to bump up the initial 128GB. There’s no SD card either, which is becoming the norm on high-end Android phones.
The rest of the phone performs well. It’s one of the best phones around for call experience, as the shape of the foldable curves around your face when you’re on the phone. There’s support for Wi-Fi 6 and 5G, too. 
Having a flexible display lets Samsung be a little bit more creative with the software. In apps such as YouTube and Google’s video chat app Duo, you can bend the display halfway to prop it up, producing a built-in stand. It’s a nice touch, made better by the sturdy hinge. While only a few apps support this natively, Samsung has added a function to force any app to split.

The rest of the software is very much the same One UI from Samsung’s other phones. There are lots of Samsung’s own services included like Samsung Pay and Bixby, so if you’d prefer Google’s alternatives there’s a bit of work to be done.
Camera
A pretty good camera but it’s not the focusTwo 12MP cameras sit on the coverAnd there’s another inside
If there’s one area you’re not quite getting the £1000/$1000 phone experience it’s with the camera. The three cameras here are all good and can take very usable shots, but they’re more comparable to mid-range devices like the Pixel 5 or a Samsung flagship from a couple of years ago than the best camera phones.
On the cover you’ve got the two main cameras. Both are 12-megapixel sensors, with the wide packing an f/1.8 lens with OIS and the ultra wide an f/2.2 lens. Thanks to the cover display you can use these two cameras for selfies too, so the 10MP inside sensor will likely be more appropriate for video calls.
The main camera copes well when you’re shooting in bright situations, with nice colours and that trademark Samsung’s processing upping the saturation to give a rich feel. Next to the Pixel 5, the snaps aren’t as natural nor as packed with dynamic range, and they can’t match the S21 range or the iPhone 12 for detail.


Switch over to the ultra wide and you can fit more in, with a little less of the oomph of colour you get from the main sensor. Ultrawide cameras have come a long way in 2021, with the OnePlus 9 Pro and Oppo Find X3 Pro both focusing as much here as they do with the main sensor so the Z Flip 3 does feel left behind in this respect.
Ultra wide shots have a strong fish-eye look
In trickier situations the Z Flip 3 can perform, but again it’s far from the best camera phone around. When shooting at night, I found bright light sources often blew out the whole picture and the night mode did little more than brighten the shot.


The lack of a dedicated zoom camera is a shame, meaning you’ll need to use a digital crop to get closer to a subject and this, of course, loses detail. If you really want the camera to be the best it can be, you’ll probably prefer the S21 line where the S21 Ultra has some of the best zoom skills around.
Don’t bother zooming
Video capture is fine with the main camera capable of 4K up to 60fps and slow-mo 720p at 960fps. There’s also support for HDR10+ shooting to add some more dynamic range to your footage.
I think it’s clear the focus here was not on the cameras – and that’s fine. This is a phone that puts form over function and it works. The pictures it captures are adequate for social media, and in daylight situations don’t look much different from the competition. It’s those trickier situations like a darkened bar where you can really tell the difference.
Battery life
No charger is included in the boxSupports wired (10w) and Qi wireless chargingGood, but not great, endurance
This is a relatively small phone so it probably comes as little shock that it doesn’t have a huge battery. The 3300mAh cell is smaller than much of the competition and translates to good, but not great, endurance.
On a typical day I was making it to bedtime with only a couple of percentage points left, and on a few particularly busy days I was reaching for a quick top-up in the evening to feel confident it would make it through.
What I did notice was that after using the phone for a while I was opening it up less and using the cover display more. This outer display works a lot like a smartwatch, and when used properly it can lead to you opening the phone less and saving more juice. If you’re not the heaviest of users – maybe around 3-4 hours of screen-on time per day – you’ll get through without many issues.

An hour of Netflix streaming took the battery down 13%, while the same amount of time spent gaming took off another 15%. These are slightly higher than other Samsung phones from this year, but then this has a smaller battery.
When it comes to charging you’ll need to provide your own plug, as the box includes just a USB-C to USB-C cable. The maximum output is 15w, which does make this a slow phone to charge. A full 0-100% charge took just shy of 110 minutes, with 50% taking around 40.
If you prefer wireless charging, the Z Flip 3 can charge at 10w. A full charge here took double the time it took when plugged in.

Should you buy it?


You crave something different: There’s no doubting the Z Flip 3 is unique and it feels like something genuinely new. Or at least a new version of something old.


Specs are what you want: The Z Flip 3 is more than fast enough, but it can’t compete with the best for camera quality, battery life or charging speeds. If these things are key, your money is better spent elsewhere.









Final Thoughts
The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is such a fun phone and it’s the first foldable that I would be happy to recommend. It’s not quite the device to make foldables mainstream, but things are heading in the right direction.
The improvements to durability, the far better cover display and the brighter, faster internal screen make this a hefty upgrade over the previous model and a great alternative to Samsung’s other phones.
If you value design and want something a little different to the typical candy bar phone, then this fits the bill. If things like camera performance and battery longevity are key you might still do better with the iPhone 12 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. You can even get the S21 Ultra for roughly the same price as the Z Flip 3.

High-end specs: Snapdragon 888, 12GB RAM and 256GB storage


Introduction
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s latest flagship foldable phone, sitting above the, by comparison, cheaper Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3.
It aims to offer a convertible handset that can be switched between phone and tablet modes using a custom folding screen.
At first glance it doesn’t look all too different to the first two generations of Samsung’s Fold line, featuring a very similar design, and the same slightly odd form factor which uses atypical aspect ratios on both screens.
However, under the hood Samsung has made a number of key changes including updated internal components and general build quality improvements. The latter is particularly important and made using the phone’s folding screen, a lot more pleasant.
Though I’m not convinced the design will be for everyone and its high price is prohibitive, even compared to the Galaxy S21 Ultra, the upgrades do enough to make the Fold 3 the first foldable I’ve tested that doesn’t feel like proof of concept.

Design and screen
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 has two screens, one on its front and a secondary folding display that turns it into a tabletBoth screens have variable refresh rates, which is great for gamersSamsung claims the folding screen is “80% tougher” than past Folds’ and has designed it to meet IPX8 water resistance certification standards
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a very different design to most phones. Specifically, it has a giant folding screen that reveals a smaller phone display when turned in on itself. This is very different to the Galaxy Z Flip 3 which has a folding screen design more akin to the clamshell mobile phone form factor of yesteryear.
This makes it undeniably chunky and heavy by traditional phone standards, despite Samsung having reduced the Fold 3’s weight from 282g to 271g. It features a giant aluminium cover along its left side that makes it look more like an old school address book than a phone. It’s also around an inch thick, which in today’s world just feels weird.
The other big difference is that it’s much longer and thinner than a regular phone, even when compared to other atypically tall handsets, such as the Xperia 1 III. The plus side of this is that, once you get used to the added heft, it is fairly easy to use in one hand.
The phone also has a slightly old school button format, with Samsung having loaded the fingerprint scanner into the Fold’s power button, which sits in the middle of its long right side.
The power button and sim card slot sit above it. This is fine for right handed people, but as a lefty I found the placement made it slightly difficult to use the fingerprint scanner. Luckily the phone’s face unlock feature was suitably reliable to not make this an issue, however.
I was also incredibly impressed with the phone’s build quality, which after our terrible experience with the first generation Fold, isn’t something I expected to say. For starters, Samsung used Gorilla Glass Victus to coat the front screen. This makes it much more crack and scratch resistant than most competing flagships. The phone’s front screen easily survived an attack from my cat, who for reasons unbeknownst to me has decided phones and tablets in the flat must all be destroyed.
The firm’s also given it a “tougher aluminium” body, which feels rugged, albeit not to the point I dared drop test the handset. The only slight downside I’ve noticed is that the back camera housing’s paint has already started to chip, leaving a visible silver line across one of its edges. I’d recommend most buyers invest in a case as a result.

The IPX8 certification is another welcome change. This makes the Fold 3 the first in the line to feature any form of water resistance and means it is capable of surviving an accidental spill or splash. With my aforementioned cat having knocked a full glass of water over it I can personally attest to the phone’s water resistance.
The most pleasing change relates to the phone’s internal screen, however. Samsung has protected it using a new film it claims makes the display 80% stronger than its predecessors. This is a big deal as the folding screen mechanism has always been a big concern for me, with it feeling a little too flimsy for my liking. The folding part of the screen feels sturdier, offering slightly more resistance while being opened and not feeling quite so delicate. The only downside is that there is still a very noticeable crease in the screen when fully open.

I still winced when opening the screen for the first couple of days, but once I got used to the mechanic I never once hesitated or worried about breaking it, outside of one bad occasion where someone nearly tore it in half.
The screens are also generally great, but come with one big drawback. Starting with the positives, both use OLED panels and come with variable 120Hz refresh rates. The big difference is that the folding 7.6-inch display is the only one of the two to feature HR10+ support.
This means both offer wonderfully deep blacks and are great for gaming. Refresh rate is a metric that determines how many images per second a screen displays. A higher number makes a screen feel more fluid and smoother to use, but eats up more battery life. A variable refresh rate lets a screen increase how many images per second are being displayed when it’s useful, like when gaming, and reduce it to save battery life when it’s not.
With real-world use I found the displays are impressive. Both offer great contrast levels and are wonderfully smooth to use. Colors are reasonably well represented to the naked eye, though I found the out of the box “Vivid” option was a little too overcooked for my liking. I’d recommend anyone that cares about color accuracy switch to the “Natural” display option as a result.
HDR shows from Amazon and Netflix looked great during my tests. Episodes of Bosch had more detail in their night time city shots than most competing phones and came close to matching the excellence of the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which has one of the best mobile displays we’ve seen this year.
This was aided by solid audio, with the phone’s stereo speakers offering decent heft and enough detail for me to comfortably binge shows in bed with feeling the need to reach for my Galaxy Buds Pro. The only downside is that their side placement makes it fairly easy to block them when using the Fold in its tablet mode.
Cracking out Trusted Labs’ colorimeter, my naked eye impressions rang true.
The front screen featured a 6300K color temperature in its natural setting, which is suitably close to the 6500K ideal. The main tablet screen was similarly accurate with the colorometer detecting a 6351K temperature. This means colors look accurate and aren’t too cold or too warm.
Max brightness levels are also solid. With the auto setting off I detected a 395.56 nit max brightness on the front screen. The tablet screen displayed a 406.87 nits max brightness with regular use. The main tablet spiked up to around 600 nits when running HDR content. This isn’t surprising as screens usually cap max brightness levels when not running specific tasks, like HDR playback, to help protect against damage. For non-techies, a nit is a measurement of luminance. One unit is roughly the brightness of a single candle.
The only downside is that neither screen is suitably accurate for serious creative work. Neither managed to achieve more than 60% of the Adobe RGB or DCI P3 gamuts favoured by creatives. Gamut coverage is a measurement of how wide a range of colors a screen can display. They’re used by professional photographers, digital artists and various other creatives to gauge how accurately a color rendered on screen will be replicated when printed.
The only downside is that, when watching content in bright environments the main folding screen’s crease and under screen 4MP camera are both very visible. The front and main screen’s atypical aspect ratios also throw up some annoying issues.
The front screen still carries an atypically tall and thin 25:9 aspect ratio, while the inner tablet has a distinctly square 22.5:18 one. The outer display is the more annoying compromise of the two. The thin dimensions make doing even basic things, like typing a reply to an incoming alert, difficult as the keyboard is much smaller than it is on a normal phone. Some apps also display oddly, with Zoom calls looking a little weird, which is a double faff, as the front display’s 10MP selfie camera delivers much better video quality than the main screen’s 4MP effort.

The square tablet screen also still isn’t optimised to play most types of content. Unless you plan to watch square content, you’re going to get huge black bars around video. This means you’re only actually getting a moderately larger window than if you watched it on a Galaxy S21 Ultra or an older Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
This issue is partially countermanded by the productivity gains I got using the tablet mode. After a week with it, the extra screen space has made the Galaxy Z Fold 3 my primary e-reader and comic binging station. Manga on CrunchyRoll looks great as do e-Books on the Kindle store. The screen is also great for basic spreadsheet work, with the extra screen real estate making it possible to edit using basic touch inputs. This will likely be made even better with an S Pen, with the Fold 3 supporting the Pro and regular versions of Samsung’s stylus. Sadly I didn’t have either on hand during testing.
Samsung has also done some good work improving the Fold 3’s multi-app support, making it quick and easy to have up to three running on the screen at any one time. As an added bonus you can easily adjust how much screen real estate each takes using basic touch inputs. This will be a serious boon for business users looking to multitask on the go.
However, even with these benefits the issues make the Fold 3 feel like it’s offering a compromised phone and tablet experience that doesn’t quite match what you get using dedicated devices’ when running certain apps.

Performance
The phone features a cutting edge Snapdragon 888 CPU that’s more than powerful enough for gaming and photo editingThe phone can get quite hot when running games for long periods
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 features a top of the line Snapdragon 888 CPU. This is the same chip used in the US versions of the Galaxy S21 Ultra and most of 2021’s other flagship smartphones. Paired with 12GB RAM this means the phone is a top performer and 5G ready.
During my time with the phone I didn’t notice any lag switching between menus and it blitzed through every process I threw at it. Over the last week I’ve used it for everything from lightweight photo editing in Photoshop Express to gaming on GeForce Now.
GeForce Now is a streaming service that lets you play AAA games from your Steam and Epic Store library over the cloud.
The only minor issue I noticed is that the device could get very warm during prolonged gaming sessions, to the point certain apps would crash. This happened more than once playing For Honor over GeForce Now.
Outside of this Samsung’s done a good job improving app stability on the Fold 3. Unlike previous models, though they sometimes don’t display quite right, with Netflix and its ilk still playing content with sizable black bars, I’ve not experienced any serious app crashes or performance issues during my time with the Fold 3.
The phone matched my real world impressions when I ran it through Trusted Labs standard suite of synthetic benchmarks. Benchmarks tests that aim to gauge a product’s performance in various areas using a series of simulated tests. You can see how it scored in the table below.

Camera
It doesn’t have as advanced rear cameras as the Galaxy S21 UltraThe front camera is built directly into the screen
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 features a fairly by the numbers rear camera setup. Specifically, it features a triple camera arrangement that combines 12MP wide, ultra-wide and tele sensors. For selfies there’s a 4-megapixel in-display unit on the tablet screen and a 10-megapixel unit on the front.
This is fairly similar to the Z Fold 2’s setup and a far cry from the setup seen on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which offers a more advanced 108 MP wide, 12 MP Ultrawide, 10 MP tele one and 2x 10 MP tele quad sensor arrangement. The only significant upgrade on the second generation fold is that the telephoto now has OIS (optical image stabilisation).
This means you miss out on a few key features, chief of which is the Ultra’s custom 100x zoom capabilities and advanced distance tracking tech. The latter aims to let the phone better gauge the distance of objects and optimise the cameras’ settings using the data.
Snapping around London, I found the arrangement to be perfectly capable, but not industry-leading, especially compared to competing flagships, like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro Max. In certain situations, it even struggles to match some of the best mid-range phones, with the Google Pixel 5’s advanced processing letting it offer better performance in low light, based on my testing.
That said, for casual users the rear camera is still perfectly capable. In regular light images come out crisp, there’s fast auto focus to ensure they’re good enough for sharing on Instagram. The processing is also typically Samsung, with the auto setting pushing colours and contrast levels to make images look generally punchier and more vivid. This may anger people that prefer a more natural look, but that’s largely a matter of personal preference. I know plenty of people that like the look, it’s just not to my personal taste.
Low light performance, while not industry leading, is reasonably good with the addition of OIS letting me capture usable photos in dim conditions. The only downside is that the camera can still struggle in more difficult scenarios, like night settings featuring strong isolated sources of light, such as street lamps or music stage lights.
I was also able to capture blur free photos at 2x zoom which is another step up on the past Fold.
The only serious downside is that the 4MP front camera is outright dire. During testing I struggled to use it for reliable video calling, let alone selfies. The 10MP front screen’s camera yields far better results, but comes with the caveat you have to frame the shots using the smaller screen, which can be a bit fiddly.
You can see a selection of sample shots taken on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 below.






Battery life
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 can survive a day’s light/moderate useGaming and video streaming puts a serious toll on the battery when it’s used in tablet mode
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 features a 4400mAh battery, which is fairly small for a device with two 120Hz screens, one of which is pseudo-tablet sized.
Going into the review I’d hoped the variable refresh rate tech would help alleviate these issues, but with real world use I found the device offers distinctly average battery life. Throughout testing I struggled to get more than a day’s use out of the Z Fold 3 off a single charge when using it as my primary work and personal phone/tablet.

This entailed listening to music, answering incoming messages, checking the internet and my social media feeds throughout the day, plus an hour’s gaming and movie streaming towards the end of the night. This was with the screen set to auto-brightness and with the variable refresh rate active.
Video playback performance was reasonable with the Fold 3 shedding an average of 7-10% of its charge per hour streaming non-HDR content from Netflix. But gaming puts a serious drain on the battery. Running games on GeForce Now in tablet mode the phone regularly lost 11% of its charge within 15 minutes. Android games put a smaller drain on the battery, but only by a small amount. This means, if you plan to use it to game on the go you will have to invest in a battery pack.
Latest deals




Should you buy it?


You’re a power user that likes to have THE latest gadgets: The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the first foldable I’ve used that doesn’t feel like a prototype thanks to general improvements to its software and build quality. If you’re a power user with cash to burn that likes the idea of a phone that converts into a tablet on the fly, this is the best option available at the moment.


You want the best phone or tablet experience possible: Despite excellent work by Samsung improving the Fold 3, the screens’ atypical aspect ratios still hinder the overall user experience. As a phone its screen feels a little too squashed, making even basic things like typing harder. The tablet’s atypical shape also makes apps look odd and means streamed videos don’t take full advantage of the extra space. As a result you’ll get a better experience using dedicated flagship devices, like the Galaxy S21 Ultra or Galaxy Tab S7 Plus.









Final Thoughts
Final thoughtsThe Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the most accomplished phone/tablet convertible Samsung’s ever made. General improvements to its build quality, a more robust folding screen and upgraded internals make it feel like a proper option for buyers, rather than a clever proof of concept. However, ongoing issues with its screens’ atypical aspect ratios can make for some awkward compromises.
The thin, atypically long front display makes some app UIs and the keyboard feel a little too squished together. The tablet mode’s square dimensions also mean some apps, particularly video streaming, have huge black bars around them that diminish the value you get from the extra screen real estate. This, plus its high price, mean most buyers will be better off investing in a normal phone, like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, and then picking up a separate tablet.

Key Features




Very ruggedHas both MIL-STD 810H standard and an IP68 rating, along with a tough casing


5GEven though it’s a rugged device it still has 5G support


Introduction
The Nokia XR20 is a rugged phone that sells at a mid-range price, and there are no extremely jarring compromises made to accommodate the rugged design.
You get an unusually strong Gorilla Glass Victus screen and a military-spec tested casing, but the Nokia XR20 also has 5G and can play demanding games moderately well. Battery life is good too, although claims of two day use may be a stretch for most scenarios. 
It is significantly more expensive, and larger, than the Motorola Defy. I enjoyed using the Moto phone marginally better, but only because its smaller stature is a little easier to handle.
I wouldn’t recommend a phone like this to someone who doesn’t actually need rugged toughness as most of the best Android phones are far superior in many areas.
But just like Motorola, Nokia has managed to make a phone with a more accessible price and design than you’d usually see from specialist manufacturers.
Design and Screen
Durable look and feelBig and heavy6.67-inch display is a good size
The Nokia XR20 is this company’s “most durable” phone to date, but I think it suits the Nokia brand well. If you have 20 year-old memories of classic Nokia phones from the pre-smartphone era, you may remember them as virtually indestructible bricks that could be, and sometimes were, thrown against a wall.
This is not a feature phone, though, and making a smartphone rugged comes with a new set of challenges. It still has a large glass screen layer, one at risk of shattering. Nokia uses Corning’s strongest Gorilla Glass to avoid this. It’s Victus-series glass, as used in Samsung’s top-end Galaxy S21 phones.
The Nokia XR20’s sides also act as shock absorbers. Press at the corners and you’ll feel the slight “give” of rubbery plastic, likely similar to the materials used in some ultra-tough cases.

By baking it into the design, Nokia has managed to make a phone that is tough but not ridiculously thick or large. The Nokia XR20 is still very big, though. Its thickened sides add a millimetre or two to the dimensions in each direction, and the phone already has an XL-size 6.67-inch screen. I’d suggest checking out the Motorola Defy if you’d rather have something smaller.
The two phones have pretty similar rugged credentials. They have been drop-tested from a height of 1.8m onto a hard surface, have the IP68 water resistance that lets you submerge them in water at a depth of 1.5m for at least half an hour. And, just as important, the Nokia XR20 has a wider operating temperature range than most, at -21 degrees centigrade to 55 degrees.
Unlike the Motorola Defy, Nokia does not seem to have teamed up with a veteran of this area like Bullitt for the phone’s design. But all the essential elements are in place. The screen surround extends just slightly beyond the display to keep it safe when sat face down on a rough surface. The camera lens gets the same treatment. And there’s a little loop on one corner to let you attach the Nokia XR20 securely to your belt or… whatever else you might want to hook it onto.

Nokia has tried to add a touch of class to accompany the tough stuff. The parts of the sides you grip are aluminium, not rubberised plastic. I don’t think this gets close to making the Nokia XR20 feel like an ordinary style-led phone, but it is an extra step Nokia did not need to make, a sign of attention to detail.
I am not a fan of the Google Assistant button Nokia seems to put on all its phones, also seen here. This sits on the left side and I guarantee you’ll press it accidentally more often than deliberately, most likely by a factor of 10 or more. The last thing a rough and tumble phone like this needs is a button you’ll press accidentally that stops your music/podcasts.

I expect Nokia has to put this button here as part of the same Google agreement that saw the company become the main maker of Android One phones — where you get vanilla Android software and guaranteed software updates. Nokia says the XR20 will get three years of core software updates and four years of security updates. It also comes with a three-year warranty in the UK, although I’d recommend looking up the terms of this if you’re planning on giving the Nokia XR20 a particularly perilous life.
Other parts to note: the Nokia XR20 has an ever-so-slightly sluggish side fingerprint scanner. And it has stereo speakers.
These speakers aren’t particularly pretty-sounding. They lack the lower-end presence that smoothes-out phone speaker audio at higher volumes. But they do have respectable top volume and enough mid-range presence to cut through a decent amount of ambient noise. 
The phone also has a headphone jack and a second SIM slot, which seems doubly important in a rugged Android like this. However, you do have to choose between a microSD or a second SIM, as this is a combi slot.  
The Nokia XR20 screen offers some of the top reasons to buy over the cheaper Motorola Defy. It’s larger at 6.67 inches, one of the largest screens found in mid-size phones. It is sharper too, with the 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution matching the “normal” phones you’re able to buy for similar money.
However, it’s the added brightness I appreciate most. The Nokia XR20 screen gets reasonably bright indoors but reserves its true peak brightness for when you go outdoors on a bright day. 
This screen’s outdoor visibility is significantly better than the Motorola Defy’s. Nokia says its peak brightness is 550 nits, which is a solid result for a phone without a top-end OLED screen, some of which can top 1000 nits (although most only actually do in very specific scenarios).

This is an LCD screen, and aside from good peak brightness and the high inch count, it is unremarkable. There’s obvious brightness loss from an angle, colour depth/calibration does not look that great to my eyes and there’s clear brightness variance around the punch hole camera at the top. This is also a 60Hz screen, one that lacks the added scrolling smoothness of a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate.
Most non-rugged £400 Androids have better displays. But then they are more likely to get scratched. Weigh up your priorities on this one, although if you don’t care about toughness why are you even reading this review?
Performance
Android One software5G support is good at this priceMid-range Snapdragon 480 chipset
The Nokia XR20 is an Android One phone. This is a Google initiative that acts as a sort of Android quality mark, although the vast majority of the best Android phones are not part of Android One.
It means the Nokia XR20 has a near-untouched version of Android 11 and you get an assurance the phone will receive, as mentioned earlier, three years of standard software updates and four years of security updates.
Android One also means there’s no software gunk in the Nokia XR20 at all, and the 128GB storage offers a good amount of room for apps and photos.

The Nokia XR20 has one of the weaker CPUs you’ll find in a phone at this price. It’s Snapdragon 480 5G, the same chipset used by the half-the-price Motorola Moto G50.
However, I find its real-world performance to be solid enough given this is part of Qualcomm’s traditionally low-end 4-series family. There’s a big gap between this and the Snapdragon 460, for example.
Android 11 runs with no obvious lag and the Snapdragon 480 does a serviceable job of playing games like Fortnite at lower graphics settings. The game looks soft, but runs OK at default graphics and major drops below 30fps are not too common.
Low-end chipsets like this benefit from a general up-rating of Qualcomm graphics chipsets this year, while somewhat affordable SoCs like the Snapdragon 860 and 870 provide flagship-level performance at a keen price.
The Snapdragon 480 doesn’t offer this, of course, but it means the Nokia XR20’s performance deficits won’t be obvious to most people most of the time.
It’s another area where you have to simply accept you get a bit less in some areas because of the phone’s rugged design. The processor is bad for a phone of this price. But in a rugged phone of this price? It doesn’t seem so bad. 
Camera
Two rear cameras48MP primary camera 13MP ultra wide secondary sensor
I am a fan of Nokia’s XR20 camera approach. You get just two lenses on the back, each has a specific purpose and there are zero “filler” cameras here to make up the numbers. Such cameras are very common in even the best mid-range phones. The similarly-priced OnePlus Nord 2’s 2MP black and white camera is a good example. Where filler cameras would normally sit, you get a dual-LED flash and a second single LED flash. 
The Nokia XR20 has a 48-megapixel primary camera, which uses a Samsung GM1 sensor. And a 13-megapixel ultra-wide with a Samsung S5K3L6 sensor.

Its ultra-wide is the more notable piece of hardware here, as I’d expect a phone like this to use a bottom-rung 8-megapixel camera. This one is no masterpiece but can at least compete with some of the better 5G phones in the price range.
These cameras are sound enough considering they are part of a rugged phone, but unsurprisingly can’t nearly compete with a price class leader like Google’s Pixel 4a 5G. The Nokia XR20’s images are frequently too cool-looking and their colour tone is often a bit off, leaving muddy tracks looking purple rather than brown. Sometimes whites look too blue.
Purple path, purple-looking clouds: the Nokia XR20 has not nailed the colour in this scene
Fine detail is good in daylight but the representations of the mid-tones and shadows aren’t in the same league as the OnePlus Nord 2’s, which I used before the Nokia XR20. Some photos end up looking a little dull, if not terribly so. 
Typical of a phone with a lower-end Snapdragon processor, there’s also a slight wait before you can preview or share an image, while the brains of the phone construct the final picture. These waits gets worse in lower-light scenes or ones where a lot of HDR processing is required.
Still, shutter lag is much less noticeable than it is in the Sony Xperia 10 III, which sells at the same price.


As you can see in the above images, the ultra-wide camera is not miserable. But its images do have lower dynamic range, tend to flatten out textures and there’s the usual corner distortion seen in every entry-level wide camera. 
The Auto HDR does a good job of balancing highlights with the foreground. And if you want the path and greenery to be brighter, lifting the shadows reveals there’s still an impressive amount of detail in there. 
Not a bad turnout for the XR20, but auto-tuning the image in Photoshop results in a much warmer colour tone
Shot with primary camera: a quick play around on Photoshop would warm up the cool colour tone, and make the highlights pop  
Shot with ultra-wide: Auto HDR has kept the sky contours on point but limited dynamic range does not show off the cathedral’s detail well 
Night photography is poor. The Nokia XR20 does have a dedicated low-light mode that takes a couple of seconds to capture an image, but its effects are not too dramatic. Dark scenes still look dark, dynamic range is poor and there’s minimal detail, although noise reduction means they don’t tend to look flat-out ugly.
The XR20’s Night mode is not particularly effective, leaving low-light shotslooking dark and vague
The Nokia XR20’s video is very limited. There’s no 4K capture mode. 1080p is the maximum resolution, and if you choose to shoot at 60fps rather than 30fps you lose out on the all-important software stabilisation. This is a pretty barebones video camera.
Nokia has put “Ozo” sound tech into the phone. In the past, this indicated the use of higher-quality microphones able to deal with very loud sound without distortion. Here, it seems to relate to a wind noise reduction feature, using two mics to reduce unwanted sound. I tried it outdoors. The clip still came out pretty windy-sounding, suggesting this is a case of milking/diluting a once quite notable piece of Nokia tech terminology.
Battery life
4630mAh battery offers good endurance18w charging is fast enough
The Nokia XR20 has a 4630 mAh battery, which is actually a slightly lower capacity than I’d usually expect from such a large phone. This suggests the rugged shell leaves less space inside than you might assume.
Real-world stamina is good, although I think you are only likely to reach Nokia’s “two day” claimed use if you use the XR20 fairly lightly. Still, I find it reaches my own personal standard for satisfaction, that of regularly ending up with around 30% charge by bed time without trying to conserve battery during the day.

I’d put this largely down to the Snapdragon 480 5G processor, which also produced great battery life results in the Motorola Moto G50.
Can you hammer it hard and be certain it will always last a full day? No. On one day of testing I had to travel half-way across the country, and managed to drain it by the evening. 
Battery charging is also not super-fast. The Nokia XR20 supports 18W charging, and takes 46 minutes to reach 50% from a flat battery. It also supports 15W wireless charging, which seems mildly surprising in a rugged phone.

Should you buy it?


You want a rugged 5G phone:The Nokia XR20 has similar rugged specs to specialist brands, but costs less than some and also has 5G mobile internet.


You don’t need a really rugged Android:The Nokia XR20 falls behind other non-rugged £400 phones in key areas, and even some £200 ones, so don’t go thinking you get an ultra-tough exterior for free.









Final Thoughts
The Nokia XR20 is a tough phone, one made to appear not to throw too much away in favour of ruggedisation. You still get 5G. You still get stereo speakers. And while the XR20 may not be a work of art, it is not comically larger than some of the other 6.67-inch screen Androids.
If you’re weighing this phone up against the Motorola Defy, its best upgrade as an outdoors phone is screen brightness. On bright days, the Nokia XR20’s display is much, much clearer.
Its zero-filler camera style is refreshing too. However, it almost goes without saying, you shouldn’t buy this phone unless you need real ruggedisation. It has the same power as phones half the price, the cameras are not hugely impressive, video modes are poor and the stereo speakers sound a little unrefined.
Still, if you do care about extras like 5G and are willing to put up with a pocket-filling phone, it’s a sensible step up from the Motorola Defy.

Verdict































The Motorola Moto E7i Power is one of the cheapest mainstream phones we’ve seen in some time, but that needs to be weighed against a correspondingly limited offering. 
For half the price of a Moto G30, you’re getting a 6.51-inch 720p LCD display, a 13MP camera, a Unisoc SC9863A processor, and a 5000 mAh battery. For non-techies, battery aside, these specs aren’t competitive with most of the best cheap phones we’ve tested this year.
But, for smartphone first-timers, parents looking for a cheap phone for young kids and those on a seriously strict budget, the Moto E7i Power is just about as solid a bet as you’ll get for less than £100.

Introduction
The Motorola Moto E7i Power might draw attention to its stamina through its ‘Power’ moniker, but the real signature feature here is its price tag.
In our business, the phrase ‘best cheap phone’ does an awful lot of heavy lifting. It’s frequently applied to a vast swathe of the market, with devices ranging from £150 right up to £400. But the Moto E7i Power makes such frivolous use of language feel borderline irresponsible.
At £79.99, the Moto E7i Power is the cheapest phone I have reviewed in an awful long time, undercutting even the £90 Nokia 1.4. It’s literally half the price of the Moto G30.
With a humble Unisoc SC9863A processor, a 720p LCD display, and one of the most stripped back camera systems you’ll find, there’s nothing remotely regal about the Moto E7i. But boy, is it budget-friendly.
Design and Screen
All-plastic designThick (9.2mm) and heavy (200g)Dim 720p LCD
Motorola is a proven master of making budget phones feel cheap, but the Moto E7i Power had to be its stiffest challenge yet. This is a price point that necessitates compromise at every turn.
You don’t expect glass and metal from an £80 phone. At this price it’s optimistic to expect high grade plastic. All you can really hope for is a phone that doesn’t feel like it’s going to come apart in your hands, and on that front the Moto E7i is largely a success.

Its all-plastic body is certainly chunky at 9.2mm thin, and it weighs a not-insignificant 200g. But it feels reasonably robust with it, and there’s little in the way of flexing or creaking when you apply some pressure. I did notice right off the bat that the red SIM tray flange was a little loosely fitted, however, and it got snagged during the initial set-up
I wouldn’t call it an attractive phone, but in the slightly shimmering Tahiti Blue shade that my model comes in (Coral Red is the other option), it’s certainly not ugly either.
Motorola has even found the space to incorporate a little texture to the buttons along the right hand edge, of which there are three: the power/sleep button has a fine grooved finish, the volume rocker is perfectly smooth, and there’s a dedicated Google Assistant button above that with four circular pips along its surface.
There are two ports on the E7i, and both of them are extremely welcome. The 3.5mm headphone jack on the top makes more sense here than on pretty much any other phone we’ve used this year, because if you’re spending this on a smartphone you’re unlikely to be shopping for one of the  best wireless headphones on the market.
The USB-C port on the bottom is also far more notable here than elsewhere. It wasn’t too long ago that a sub-£100 phone would tend to include a terrible Micro USB port.
There’s no hole punch display notch around the front, so you’ll have to make do with an old school teardrop alternative. But it’s one of the more subtle ones.

The screen itself is just about the minimum spec you could imagine from a modern phone. It’s plenty big enough at 6.51-inches, and it’s an IPS display, so viewing angles aren’t terrible. But it doesn’t get very bright at all at 380 nits (typical), and its LCD colours lack any kind of pop or contrast. Needless to say, HDR support is not on the menu here.
The resolution is a poor 1600 x 720 (720p), so you won’t be getting the Full HD experience from video content. Thumbnail images and web content is where you’ll really spot the shortfall in day to day usage. Naturally, the refresh rate is a baseline 60Hz.
For all that, the Moto E7i Power’s display is just fine, given the price. It’ll display your messages and social media posts perfectly adequately, which is really all it’s likely to be asked to do by most people.
Camera
13MP main sensor takes barely adequate shots in good lightingNight mode is nigh-on useless, as is the 2MP macro sensorNo telephoto or ultra-wide
It shouldn’t surprise you to learn that the Moto E7i Power’s camera provision isn’t great – it’s about as far from the best camera phone as you’ll get. 
One of the main things you pay more for in a phone (generally speaking) is a decent camera, so of course a super-cheap phone shouldn’t be expected to take very good shots.

Taking point here is a 1/3.1″ 13MP wide sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and PDAF. This is a small, humble sensor without OIS or any fancy tricks, and the best thing I can say for it is that it doesn’t disappoint for the money.
In practice that means you’ll be able to capture adequate shots if you’re in nigh-on perfect lighting. They’ll be fine to share on social media and WhatsApp, with reasonably natural colors, and even a rudimentary grasp of contrast.


Don’t look too closely, though, or you’ll pick up on the grain in those blue skies, or the fact that detail drops off a cliff as soon as you stray indoors, or when the light dips. The Auto HDR is strictly limited too, completely failing to pick out darker areas in certain predominantly bright shots.


There’s a Night mode here, but from what I can see it’s not the usual multi-shot affair. Rather, it seems to simply artificially brighten the image, which is a quick and easy if wholly insufficient alternative. The results are predictably dark and grainy, and not something I’d term usable in any scenario.

The Moto E7i’s dual-camera set-up is one of the most pared-back you’ll find. But if anything, I feel it should have gone further. There’s absolutely no need for the 2MP macro sensor that’s been supplied here. 
It’s fair enough that Motorola’s impossibly tight budget precluded the provision of an ultrawide and a telephoto sensor, though it does greatly hamper your shooting options. The video provision is similarly limited, with the possibility of a mere 1080p at 30fps.
There’s a 5MP selfie camera around the front, which sounds respectable, but is actually pretty terrible. Self-snaps lack pop, detail and invariably feature blown out highlights.

Ultimately, I feel a little silly talking about the Moto E7i Power’s camera quality, as it’s really not going to be a deciding factor for anyone weighing up a purchase. All they will really need to know is this: the Moto E7i Power is an incredibly cheap smartphone that also happens to take pictures.
Performance
Humble Unisoc SC9863A offers basic performanceOnly 2GB RAM makes multi-tasking limitedScant 32GB storage runs out fast if you download media
If you’re expecting or even hoping that the Moto E7i Power can punch above its weight in the performance stakes, then we’d like to welcome you to the review. You should probably go back and read the previous sections, but never mind.
To give you the TL;DR summary: this is an £80 phone, which means severe compromises have been made at every turn. And that includes the silicon at the heart of it all.
You might not have heard of the Unisoc SC9863A chip before. Don’t worry, it’s hardly a household name. This is a humble 28nm octa-core chip, which is backed by an equally humble 2GB of RAM.

That would be below the minimum we’d hope for in an Android phone, but Google’s lightweight Android Go software ensures that it’s not a complete stutterthon. Layered on top of Android 10 rather than Android 11, it’s a perfectly clean and crisp take on Android with absolutely no bloatware whatsoever. 
Everything runs on Google’s apps, which makes it more pleasant to use than some flagship phones with their ugly custom UIs. Well, almost.
Don’t set your sights on any kind of advanced multi-tasking or 3D gaming, though. An average Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 474 is about a third of the score attained by the £160 Moto G30.
In the interest of science I booted up a round of PUBG Mobile. Interestingly, while it defaults to the lowest (Smooth) Graphics settings, it also defaults to Medium rather than Low Frame Rate. Jumping into the classic Erangel map, though, I wished it had played it safer, as the experience was halting and clunky.
Backing this up is 32GB of internal storage, which is something not seen for years. Even £200 phones have started offering 128GB these days. There is a microSD slot, at least, so you can expand that.
Really this all confirms that if you’re after smartphone bangs for your bucks, you ideally want to be shopping around the £150 mark and above these days. Below that point you’re looking at severely diminishing returns.
Of course, many people will simply be unable or unwilling to pay more than £80 for a smartphone – perhaps for a young child, or for an elderly relative. From that perspective, the Moto E7i Power performs perfectly well. Skipping between home screens occurs without too much incident, and there’s nothing that feels fundamentally broken here. That’s progress compared to many previous super-cheap handsets.
Battery Life
5000 mAh battery is large, but not still slightly smaller than the G9 Power40 hours battery life during testingSlow 10W charger supplied
The Moto E7i Power joins Motorola’s family of stamina-focused phones, but it doesn’t have the whopping great 6000mAh cell of the Moto G9 Power we tested at the start of the year.
Instead, it relies on an altogether more compact 5000 mAh cell. That’s still far from small, and is it is bigger than the batteries of most flagship phones these days. But it’s also not an unusual spec for an affordable phone.
Motorola’s claims for the E7i Power are a more modest 40 hours on a single charge, as opposed to 60 hours for the Moto G9 Power. 
Still, together with that dim 720p display, the Moto E7i Power packs decent stamina. I found that I was able to get through a long 15 hour day of light usage (2 hours 30 of screen on time) with more than 60% left in the tank. And as we’ve hopefully established, light usage is what this phone is intended for.
Heavier usage scenarios, such as media consumption, will hit that battery hard. One hour of Netflix streaming took 12% out of the E7i Power, which isn’t too hot at all. Your average £200 smartphone with a 5000 mAh battery, like the Oppo A54 5G, will sap 9% in similar circumstances.
All of which leads me to suspect that moderate users could potentially shoot for just shy of two days of usage on a single charge. In other words: Motorola was about right on its 40 hours claim.
The Moto E7i Power has been bundled with a 10W wired charger, which is pretty slow by modern standards. It’s another compromise in service of that price tag, and you can easily double or even triple those charging speeds by spending £160 to £200.

Should you buy it?


You need the cheapest smartphone possible from a reliable brand: At £80, phones don’t get any cheaper than the Moto E7i Power without compromising on reliability


You plan on doing anything intensive: The Moto E7i Power has just about the most humble specs you can imagine, so you’ll need to keep things light









Final Thoughts
It’s seriously impressive how Motorola has managed to build such a competent phone for so little money. Still, those cuts run deep, and spending a little more money will get you significantly superior results.

Verdict


































Once you get past the price, the Apple MagSafe Battery Pack is a capable device that wins out due to its deep integration with iOS. This is a handy accessory for those with an iPhone 12 Mini or an iPhone 12 but hardly a must-have.



Pros
Small and compactDoubles as a 15w wireless chargerPerfoms its job very wellDeep iOS integration

Cons
Won’t fully charge any iPhone 12 modelIt is very expensive5w is pretty slow

Key Features




MagSafeMagnets to keep it in place and secure


Works with iPhoneDesigned for iPhone 12 series, but does work with other Qi devices


Introduction
Like a lot of Apple’s own accessories for its iPhones, the MagSafe Battery Pack has caused quite the stir since its stealthy release. 
The usual calls of being overpriced, lacking in features and so on have been easy to spot in any online discussion about the charger. Yet, after spending some time with it, it’s clear that it serves its purpose very well.
This is easily the most worthwhile MagSafe-branded accessory I have used since the tech was reborn as a magnetic iPhone system alongside the iPhone 12.
Design
Comes only in whiteSingle Lightning portSoft finish
The MagSafe Battery Pack is small, simple and distinctly Apple. There are no buttons anywhere, just a Lightning port and an LED that indicates when it’s charged or being charged.
In terms of size, it’s almost exactly the width of the iPhone 12 Mini. It’s small enough to slip into a pocket alongside the phone (11m thick) and it’s very light (113g).
MagSafe Battery Pack on the iPhone 12
The Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max
There’s one colour option – white, with a grey back. I can see this getting dirty over time, especially if you keep it in your jeans, so it would have been nice to have a darker shade made available too.
The outer shell is made from a soft-touch plastic that has a nice, grippy texture to it, and the back has a rubberised pad to make sure it sticks to your phone. It’s all very simple and stylish.

There has been some concern about just how strong the magnets are in these MagSafe accessories. The Wallet, for instance, received some criticism for popping off too easily. I’ve found the connection between the battery pack and the phone to be strong, even more so if you’ve got a case on. 
There’s a bit of wobble towards the bottom and it will fall off if you really shake the phone, but you probably shouldn’t be shaking your phone in the first place.

Battery Life and Features
 Works with iPhone 12 models (and future MagSafe devices) Can’t fully charge any of those models Great for small top-ups
The MagSafe Battery Pack isn’t designed to be a charger to give your iPhone 12 multiple boosts. 
It is not competing against those hefty packs from the likes of Anker that can keep your phone chugging along through a weekend at Glastonbury or on a camping holiday. 
Instead, this is more for those situations where you’re running for the last tube and your phone is close to the red, or waiting for someone’s call and you’re away from the plug.

This purpose is made clear by both the size of the pack itself and, in turn, the fairly small 1460mAh battery. I tested this with all three sizes of iPhone 12 (12 Mini, 12 and 12 Pro Max) and it couldn’t give any of them a full charge.
On the iPhone 12 Mini, it took a completely depleted device to 78%; an iPhone 12 to 60% and an iPhone 12 Pro Max to 49%. Of course, these figures will likely vary, but it’s a handy guide.
Interestingly, the first time you attach the add-on to your phone you’ll get a pop-up saying it won’t attempt to charge your phone past 90%. This makes sense, as it requires a lot of oomph to fill that final 10% and Apple clearly feels the trade-off in efficiency isn’t worth it. If you disagree and want to push it, then there’s an option in the Control Centre to disregard this limit.

When you snap the magnetic battery pack to the back of your phone it will charge at 5W. This is fairly slow, but the same speed is provided by the Anker 5K. 5W is roughly the same as the older plugs that came with iPhones until the 11 series and it does feel very slow if you’re used to something faster. For example, the MagSafe Battery Pack took 120 minutes to charge up a 12 Pro Max until it ran out.
Another use of the MagSafe Battery Pack is as a portable 15W wireless charger. This works when the battery is plugged into a fast USB-C plug. As MagSafe is backwards compatible with Qi, it will charge other phones and accessories like AirPods Pro too – but always at a maximum of 5W. I attached a Pixel 5 and it charged fine.

When the MagSafe Battery Pack runs out of charge there are a number of ways to top it up. You can plug a Lightning cable into the bottom and charge from there, or attach it to the back of an iPhone 12 series and plug the cable into the iPhone. This will then intelligently charge both the phone and battery pack.
The most unique charging method is when you attach the battery to the iPhone and then plug a cable into the battery itself. This then uses a form of reverse wireless charging to juice up both devices. This is another area where the MagSafe Battery Pack shines. Other similar packs I have tried require charging separate to the phone, but due to Apple’s control over the ecosystem, you can charge both with one cable. It is worth noting you don’t get a cable with the Battery Pack, so you’ll need the one from your iPhone.
What you can’t do though is use this to charge other devices with a cable. This is a limit of Lightning not being capable of charging in both directions. If you want to share the power here with a friend, you’ll have to hope they have a Qi-enabled phone.

There’s deep integration in other parts of iOS 14.7 too. You’ll get a pop-up every time you attach the pack with a charge update, and it’ll be visible in the handy iOS battery widget too. If you’ve ever used the previous iPhone battery cases then you’ll be very familiar with this as it’s something you don’t get with third-party products. It’s a shame Apple doesn’t allow accessory makers access to these parts of the OS.

Should you buy it?


You need some extra juice in your iPhone 12: This is a small, compact add-on that gives some extra charge when you need it most. It also boasts excellent integration into iOS.


You want a huge capacity:  This won’t fully charge any of the iPhone 12 models and it’s not really going to do a good job if you want to go from 0-100%. There are better options out there for that purpose.









Final Thoughts
There’s no getting around it – at £99/$99, this is a pricey add-on. But for many, I think it’s genuinely worth it. If you’ve got an iPhone 12 Mini or iPhone 12 then the extra juice is welcome and the deep integration makes it much better to use than competing products. It also doubles as a very fast wired charger for the iPhone 12 series.

Verdict


































The Xperia 1 III is one of the most interesting phones I’ve tested this year. This isn’t a cookie-cutter flagship impersonating a Galaxy S21 in its attempt to earn a place among the best Android phones – it’s doing its own thing and I appreciate that a lot. 
It’s great to see features like the SD card slot and headphone jack kept in. Design-wise its also wonderfully unique featuring a notch and cut-out free screen alongside an atypically tall and narrow design. On top of this it’s fast, has a good camera and mostly fluid software.
But, there are bits that aren’t a complete success. Some parts of the camera need improving and I’d like a brighter screen when outside. Still, even with these flaws this is the best Sony flagship in a long time and it shouldn’t be dismissed – even at its high asking price.



Pros
No notch and cutout leaves screen uninterruptedNarrow body is great most of the timeFeatures ditched elsewhere like SD card, headphone jack included

Cons
Screen doesn’t get bright enough outdoorsTall display can make certain things feel crampedLow-light and zoom photography isn’t that great for something that costs this much

Key Features




Tall 4K displayThe 21:9 screen has a 4K resolution, HDR and 120Hz refresh rate


Triple camera arrayYou’ve got a wide, ultra wide and a duo of tele cameras here


High-end specsHi-Res audio support, Snapdragon 889, 5G, 12GB and up to 512GB storage


Introduction
Sony is taking Android phones seriously again. The Xperia 1 III is as feature-rich as any other device around, pushing the limits with its 4K 120Hz screen and variable camera system.
Sony phones have often felt like niche products that aren’t quite as good as they should be. That niche element is still retained with the Xperia 1 III, however it’s a far more complete Android phone than previous attempts.
Design and Screen
4K display with 120Hz refresh rateTall 21:9 aspect ratioSimple, attractive look
There’s a lot I like about the display on the Xperia 1 III and a lot that has annoyed me during my week with the phone. Let’s start with the good stuff.
There’s no doubting the quality of the 6.5-inch OLED panel and the addition of a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling makes it a notable improvement over the Xperia I II. That phone had some odd software trickery to try and fool you into thinking its bog-standard 60Hz panel was faster.
120Hz makes a number of obvious differences. This means that the screen refreshes 120 times per second, rather than 60 times on a 60hz screen. Swipes and scrolls in everything from Twitter to Google Docs are smoother, games are more responsive and there’s just a generally faster feel in everything you do. A faster refresh rate is one of those things that needs to be seen and used to really be understood. Once you’ve used a phone with it, it’s hard to go back.

The screen also has an atypically high 4K resolution. This feature has been a headline addition to Sony’s flagships over the past few years and the Xperia line is still the only place this pixel-dense addition can be found. Most phones, like the Galaxy S21, have a 1080p panel, while others up that further to 1440p.
Pushing up to 4K does give Sony something its big rivals don’t and while you likely won’t notice the difference in regular use it does make a difference in media – if you go looking. 4K YouTube videos have extra sharpness and if you appreciate the difference, you’ll find the Xperia 1 III ticks all the right boxes.
Of course, a higher resolution doesn’t necessarily equal a better display. I’ve used many 4K TVs that look worse than 1080p alternatives and older Xperia 4K phones were comfortably beaten by the lower-res competition. It’s just as important to have accurate and pleasing colours.
The Xperia 1 III offers two distinct colour modes. By default, there’s a standard mode enabled which has quite a punchy, saturated look. Everything is bright and colours pop, possibly a little bit too much. Delve into settings though and there’s an option to switch this into Creator mode. This, as Sony puts it, aims to provide a ‘faithful reproduction of the creator’s intention through 4K display and specially developed image processing with BT.2020 colour gamut and 10-bit colour of HDR spec’. Whether that means anything to you or not is beside the point, as enabling this mode is my preferred way to get the most from this screen.
Everything feels a little warmer, more realistic and generally more pleasing. It feels like when you switch a TV from standard mode to cinema mode – it might take some adjustment to that more orangey look, but you’ll find the other mode a bit lurid when you go back.

This really is a great screen for watching content on. Films shot to fit the display’s 21:9 aspect ratio look ace, while the lack of a notch makes this one of the few high-end phones around that doesn’t have an annoying interruption on the screen. Apps like Netflix support HDR, and I truly believe the added punch this gives makes the viewing experience even better.
Now, there are some areas where I am still entirely not convinced by some of Sony’s choices. The 21:9 design makes for a tall device that’s good for one-handed use and ideal for scrolling in apps like Instagram and Twitter, but not so much for getting as much as possible on the screen. The narrow panel feels far more cramped than many of the other best phones around. It’s also not the best experience when you’re watching videos not shot for the aspect ratio as hefty black bars are commonplace especially when watching YouTube.
It’s taller than the iPhone 12 Pro Max
The panel also struggles to get truly bright enough to use comfortably on a really sunny day – an issue I haven’t had for a while with a phone this expensive.
Even with those quirks, I do like the display a lot and I am glad Sony is offering something different to the swathes of curved, notched displays that sit on most Android flagships.
While the screen goes all-out, the design of the Xperia 1 III is fairly modest. This is far from a bad thing and I think this is a very good looking phone that again offers features others have ditched.
There’s a very capable 3.5mm port on the top, a microSD/SIM tray that doesn’t require a pesky tool for removals and a dedicated multi-step button for opening and shooting with the camera. Sony has even kept around the notification light. I appreciate all these additions.

Along with that camera shutter button, there’s a Google Assistant key and a power key with a fingerprint sensor embedded inside. As this isn’t a flexible display, there’s no fingerprint sensor underneath the screen.
This isn’t a flashy phone. The matte back is soft to the touch and doesn’t get fingerprints all over it while the two colour combinations are muted. It feels durable thanks to sturdy metal sides along with Gorilla Glass Victus on the screen and an IP68 rating. 
Camera
A capable triple camera systemVariable tele cameraPro modes for video and photo
This is the section where the Sony Xperia 1 III will be at its most controversial. 

If we’re talking about pure tech specs, then Sony has done pretty much all it can to make the Xperia 1 III 2021’s best camera phone. There are three main 12MP cameras (wide, ultra wide and tele zoom) with the bottom one using the periscope lens feature utilised on the Huawei P40 Pro Plus and Galaxy S21 Ultra. This telephoto lens is also variable so it can switch between a duo of focal lengths, giving you more versatility with the zoom. 
Sony has also combined the functionality of the basic Android camera app into the Photography Pro app it shipped last year. This is exactly what I asked for when reviewing the Xperia I II and for the most part, it makes for a good experience. Sony has taken inspiration from its well-respected Alpha line of cameras for the design, with many of the dials and options plucked straight from there.
The updated camera app
There’s a lot to like about this camera and in many situations, shooting with it is fantastic. The ridiculously fast autofocus in burst mode is a revelation for snapping shots of my fast-moving puppy and I rarely got a shot that was out of focus when she was running around. That’s something I can’t say when shooting with any other phone.
The burst can capture sharp detail even with very fast movement

Sony doesn’t focus as much on post-processing as some of the competition, with snaps looking more natural and less vivid than those from a Samsung or Apple phone. 
Colours can pop if you play about with the settings
Daylight snaps are bright and colourful
I don’t mind this look and it does give you a more neutral starting point from which to edit snaps, however everything looks a little flatter as a result. You’ll notice this especially in situations with lots of shadows, where smaller details are lost.
Jump into the Pro section of the app and there are swathes of settings for tweaking and tuning things to exactly how you want them to be if you’re willing to put the effort in. I still think Sony needs to cater more for those who would prefer that the phone do a better job without too much fiddling around.
The actual photography falls down a bit when you’re either using the duo of zoom sensors or shooting in tougher, darker environments.
Details are lost when you push the zoom
In night situations, the focussing system goes from excellent to average. On multiple occasions, while shooting in darker bars and restaurants, the photos I shot were out of focus and pretty poor. These are the moments where you don’t want to be using the Pro settings, instead having the camera do some of the heavy lifting for you.
Details can be quickly lost if the lighting isn’t great
Sunset shots can look great
The adaptive zoom tech is clever, and you can quickly jump from 2.9x (70mm) to 4.4x (105mm). This isn’t as wild as the 10x or 20x (let’s not count those ridiculous 100x zooms here) but it’s probably more in the realm of what people actually want. Photos at these zoom lengths are fine, but not as good as similar shots I took with a Galaxy S21 Ultra.

Video is a bit of disappointment too. Video can be shot through the Cinema Pro app and when you open the app for the first time you’ll be greeted with a serious amount of settings, options and dials. 
You can alter the look of your video, easily change the resolution, ISO, white balance and so on. It all looks very professional and it should do, as it’s inspired by the Sony CineAlta brand. But really the results are no better than on other phones, even if you spend a lot of time fiddling with all the options. 
The ultrawide camera is good, if not quite as sharp as some of the competition
I do like the majority of shots I took with the Xperia 1 III, especially those in daylight situations. The shutter button gets you to the camera fast and the ridiculously snappy AF system makes this the best camera for shooting pets I have ever used. But, even with the wealth of options available often I felt it was missing the point of a phone camera.
Performance
Snapdragon 8885G support256GB/512GB storage
The Sony Xperia I III isn’t just high-performing when it comes to the speed of the Snapdragon 888 chipset. It also has great stereo speakers, wide Hi-Res audio support and plenty of RAM. It’s expensive yes, but there’s very little missing.
That flagship Qualcomm chipset ensures general performance is mostly very good (there are some issues, but I’ll get on to that later). This phone can handle any app or game you throw at it without chugging or dropping frames.
Scores in benchmark apps put it alongside other Android big hitters like the Exynos Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and Oppo Find X3 Pro. If you want to see the scores, see the bottom of this review for a full readout.
The wide display is great for gaming and Sony has added a few custom tricks into the software to give you a little more control. The Game Enhancer toolkit includes stuff like screen recording up to 1080p 120fps, the ability to release extra RAM to a game and handy tweaks like disabling notifications and auto-brightness.

If you’re really serious about gaming then you can connect up a Bluetooth controller. Sony says there is official support for the Dualshock 4 but not the PS5’s Dualsense. That’s odd, especially as the iPhone has full support for Sony’s latest pad within iOS.
The audio from this phone is great. There’s a very capable headphone port on the top and it can stream High-Res audio through Sony’s LDAC codec to compatible headphones like the WF-1000XM4s. The front-firing stereo speakers are great and easily among the best I have used on a phone this thin.
Sony has scaled back its Android interface in recent years, going with a far more Google-esque look. There is a selection of Sony tweaks, but many of these actually work quite well. There’s a Side Sense shortcut bar that packs more apps onto your home screen and a very helpful one-handed mode. The tall 21:9 screen is also among the best around for multitasking, as there’s plenty of space for two apps to sit above and below each other.
However, the software – which is built upon Android 11 – isn’t without its quirks. Throughout my time with the phone, there have been multiple occasions of weird activity. Sometimes the phone takes an age to rotate when I am watching a video and often the screen seems slow to respond to my taps. These are not constant issues, but they appear more than I would expect.
There’s also a lot of pre-installed stuff here. An app offering me a free trial of Tidal, LinkedIn, Call of Duty and Prime Video were all on the homescreen when I first booted the phone up. Hardly a big issue, but still something I would rather not see.
Battery Life
4500mAh cell30w charging wiredWireless charging also included
There’s been a big boost to the actual battery inside the Xperia 1 III when compared to the older Xperia 1 II. It’s now a 4500mAh cell, rather than 4000mAh, and has quicker 30w wired charging. I managed to go from 0-100% in roughly 90 minutes, while a 50% top-up took 30 minutes.
That 30w wall plug is included too, which is a welcome touch these days. There’s support for wireless charging and reverse wireless charging for juicing up a pair of earbuds or a Qi-enabled smartwatch.
Neither the battery size nor the charging is the best around, but that’s not to say the battery life is disappointing here. Considering the pixels being pushed, I managed to get through the day comfortably with typically 10-15% left.
Along with the fast charging, there’s a focus on slow charging too. Battery health is a feature often sacrificed in the race to get from 0-100% in the quickest possible time but it’s something Sony really does care about. 
Being able to have the phone trickle charge overnight, only finishing the top-up before you wake up, is such a great idea for when charging quickly offers no benefit.

Should you buy it?


You don’t want to sacrifice any port or feature: SD expansion, removable SIM tray without a tool, notification light, headphone jack – that’s just a few of the serious amount of handy extras Sony has made sure the Xperia 1 III has.


You want a camera that does the hard work: These are strong cameras but the camera app asks you to do a lot of the heavy lifting to really get great shots.









Final Thoughts
This is the best phone from Sony I have ever used and it’s the first time there isn’t as obvious a missing feature. I’d go as far as saying this is the most fully-featured Android phone around.

Jargon buster

mAh
An abbreviation for milliampere-hour and a way to express the capacity of batteries, especially smaller ones in phones. In most cases the higher the mAh, the longer the battery will last but this isn’t always the case.


5G
Offering faster download and upload speeds when compared to 4G. Great for game streaming and HDR video playback. Not supported everywhere yet and speeds vary wildly. 


Qi Wireless Charging
																 
The most common format for wireless charging and the one supported by the majority of devices. Charge speeds vary a lot by the phone. 


ANC
																ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) uses an array of microphones in a headphone to detect the frequency of the sound coming at the listener, with the ANC chip creating an inverse wave (i.e. opposing sound) to suppress any unwanted external noises.



aptX
																Qualcomm’s aptX codec can support higher quality audio than Bluetooth alone.
															

Bluetooth
																Bluetooth - named after 10th-century Danish king Harald Bluetooth who united Denmark’s tribes into a single kingdom - is a method of wireless transmission that allows for the exchange of data between devices over short distances.
															

4K Ultra HD TV
																4K (or Ultra HD) refers to the resolution of a TV’s display, which equates to the number of horizontal and vertical pixels that it can display. 4K TVs have a resolution of 3840 x 2160 (8.3 million pixels), which is four times that of a Full HD TV. With more pixels, you get a sharper, clearer picture than is possible from an equivalent sized 1080p display.
															

HDR10+
																HDR10+ is a HDR variant created by 20th Century Fox, Panasonic and Samsung as a free to use, open platform alternative to Dolby Vision. Like Dolby Vision, it adds dynamic metadata on top of the core HDR10 signal that tells a TV how it should adjust the brightness, colours and contrast of content for the most optimal picture quality.

Verdict


































The OnePlus Nord 2 5G is a more affordable alternative to the OnePlus 9. It looks and feels just as good, gaming performance is strong and even the camera is no clean sweep for the OnePlus 9, as the Nord 2 offers better selfies and cleaner night images. However, battery life disappoints.

Key Features



MediaTek Dimensity 1200 AIOnePlus puts a MediaTek CPU in its phones for the first time. It offer excellent gaming performance, if not quite Qualcomm Snapdragon-level efficiency. 


Stereo speakersThe Nord 2 has two speakers, one on the front above the screen and another on the phone’s bottom. Great for gaming. 


50MP cameraA 50MP Sony camera is a highlight, able to shoot very good quality images in day and light. 


Introduction
The OnePlus Nord 2 5G is one of the best phones to consider if you would like a high-end Android but find the idea of spending £800 or more ridiculous.
It looks, feels and runs like a top-end Android but costs a lot less, giving it some of the bargain flavour that made us recommend OnePlus phones so highly back in the company’s early years.
The OnePlus Nord 2 5G doesn’t have a zoom camera and its battery life is only passable. But it is excellent value, and a worthy follow-up to the original OnePlus Nord.

If you’re wondering whether this phone is worth the upgrade over the OnePlus Nord CE 5G, I think it is. A glass back means it feels and looks more expensive, and the camera array is in another league, getting close to the quality of the OnePlus 9. It even beats it in a few areas.
The OnePlus Nord 2 5G is available in two core models. There’s an entry-level version with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. It costs £399.
OnePlus’s step-up Nord 2 5G has 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, and costs £469. Which should you buy? OnePlus’s upgrade fees are fair, but £70 will buy you a lot of treats.

Design
Glass-back design is a clear step up from the Nord CE 5GLoud stereo speakersFast in-screen fingerprint scanner
The OnePlus Nord 2 5G looks quite a lot like the OnePlus 9. And that is notable in part because the Nord CE 5G didn’t.
There’s the bug-eyed camera housing OnePlus introduced in its 9-series phones and classic OnePlus hardware features like the silent mode slider return. However, the glass back is the part I appreciate most.
The OnePlus Nord 2 5G uses Gorilla Glass on front and back, and the rear panel is curved at the sides to make the phone feel thinner. This phone feels very similar to the OnePlus 9, just a little smaller, and much nicer than the Nord CE 5G, which seems a bit cheap by comparison.

It’s not an entirely no-compromise design, though. The OnePlus Nord 2 5G’s sides are plastic, a “fiberglass infused polymer”, not aluminium. Hardened plastic like this is going to pick up dents and scuffs less easily.
On the other hand, the glossy, chrome-like finish may also show off any damage so I’d recommend using the silicone case OnePlus puts in the box. While OnePlus always makes a good selection of “official” cases for its phones, the bundled one is good. It has a textured panel across the back where your hand rests to avoid the tacky feel of flat silicone.
And, as usual, the OnePlus Nord 2 5G comes with a factory-applied screen protector. There’s no official water resistance rating here, but if you put the thing in its case from day one it should be pretty easy to keep pristine.
However, these are the basics common to all OnePlus phones I’ve used since 2013. Parts that deserve more attention include the OnePlus Nord 2 5G’s loud and fairly beefy-sounding stereo speakers and what OnePlus calls Haptics 2.0.

The first thing I noticed on day one of using the OnePlus Nord 2 5G was that its vibration effects are more refined and sophisticated than you usually get in the best mid-range phones. On unlocking with a finger scan you can get a little haptic ”tap”, switching to Silent mode with the hardware slider results in two lighter taps. And, of course, the OnePlus Nord 2 5G can produce the classic buzz of a phone call vibrate. These kinds of haptics are usually associated with the best iPhones. The OnePlus 9 has similar feedback.
You could call this stuff needless fluff. But I noticed this change before digging into the OnePlus Nord 2 5G feature list and realising it had a name, Haptics 2.0, and it does help the phone feel more like a high-end Android than a budget one. 

As does the fingerprint scanner. The OnePlus Nord 2 5G has an in-screen fingerprint reader. And unlike some of the cheaper phones that use this style, there are no issues with its speed or reliability. It seems just as fast as that of some flagship phones.
There is nothing significant to dislike here at the price. Well, aside from the lack of a headphone jack or microSD slot. If you want one of those I’d suggest one of Xiaomi’s cheaper Poco or Redmi phones, several of which are brilliant lower-cost options, particularly if you don’t care about 5G. A few of the best still only have 4G mobile internet, like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro.
Screen
OnePlus 9-beating display brightnessMid-rankning 90hz refresh rate
The OnePlus Nord 2 5G has a 6.43-inch Full HD OLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. This puts its roughly on par with the OnePlus 8 released a little over a year before this Nord. Newer OnePlus phones have 120Hz OLED screens, likely because the cost of those components has since come down.
A higher refresh rate results in smoother-scrolling menus, but you do still get the bump up from standard 60Hz. 
It’s a great screen. Sharp, bold and fairly bright, in most situations, it is often hard to distinguish the OnePlus Nord 2 5G screen from that of a phone twice the price.

Peak brightness has become one of the few things that makes a meaningful difference between mid-range and high-end Androids so I took the OnePlus Nord 2 outdoors with the Nord CE 5G and OnePlus 9 to see how it stacks up.
The OnePlus Nord 2 is, surprisingly enough, the brightest of the three. While it doesn’t reach the sort of levels as an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21 Ultra (despite OnePlus claims of 1000-plus nits for the OnePlus 9) in general use, outdoors visibility is very good.
Performance
A smooth, responsive take on AndroidGreat gaming performance for the priceFirst OnePlus phone with a MediaTek CPU
The Nord 2 is the first OnePlus phone not to use a Qualcomm processor. It has a MediaTek one instead, the Dimensity 1200-AI. MediaTek chipsets were once considered the cheap and often not very good alternatives to Qualcomm models, but this one is pretty powerful.
Still, OnePlus likely used it instead of the excellent Snapdragon 870 because the Dimensity is cheaper.
General performance is excellent. The OnePlus Nord 2 seems to run about as fast as the OnePlus 9 as you dart around Android. Performance in high-end games like Fortnite is also strong for this price class.
Set Fortnite to Epic graphics with the resolution slider to 100% and it stays more-or-less locked to 30fps even at the start of the round as you fall from the drop ship. This part causes obvious slow-downs even in a great budget gaming chipset like the Snapdragon 765G.

According to 3DMark’s Wildlife benchmark, the Nord 2’s Dimensity 1200-AI has gaming power similar to a Snapdragon 865+. It beats the OnePlus 8T, which is less than a year old at the time of release. CPU performance is roughly level with the OnePlus 8T’s Snapdragon 865, judging by the Geekbench score of 2748. 
OnePlus also offers very fast storage. The 256GB version tested reaches read speeds of 1218MB/s and writes of 548MB/s according to the A1 SD Bench app. That means you get ‘writes’ similar to a fast SATA SSD, and ‘reads’ more like those of an NVMe SSD from a couple of years ago. Not bad for a mid-range phone. This likely has a hand in making apps load quickly.
I can see why OnePlus chose this MediaTek chipset to divert from its traditional Qualcomm-only approach, although I am not convinced the Dimensity 1200 AI is as power-efficient as some Qualcomms. Read the battery life section for more on this.

Camera
Strong 50MP primary camera even performs well at nightWeaker wide cameraFairly poor digital zoom
The OnePlus Nord 2 has three rear cameras but you might as well consider it a dual camera system. Its third is one of the 2MP monochrome cameras OnePlus has used in previous phones.
I’m not even sure where it’s used. OnePlus has said it’s for one of the specific B&W colour filters in previous phones. But there’s only one B&W mode in the Nord 2 and the results don’t seem to change if you put your finger over the monochrome camera’s lens.

The real reason OnePlus likely uses a third camera is because a triple camera phone will sell better than a dual camera one, even if that tertiary lens is completely useless. It’s there because we’re all idiots, in other words.
That out of the way, the OnePlus Nord 2 camera is great, and a significant upgrade over the cheaper Nord CE 5G’s.
The parts I appreciate most are how fast and responsive this camera feels for a mid-range model and that the Auto HDR processing seems next-to bulletproof. There’s no noticeable shutter lag, no fundamental focus issues, images are processed and finalised in the gallery at a similar speed to a phone with a Snapdragon 888 CPU.
It’s in a completely different universe to the similarly-price Sony Xperia 10 III, which is sluggish and unreliable. And cycling between the two fields of view provided by the primary and ultra-wide cameras is quick in the OnePlus Nord 2 as well.
This stuff matters just as much as image quality, as it makes a phone camera enjoyable to use.

The Nord 2’s main camera has a 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor, the same seen in the top-end Oppo Find X3 Pro. OnePlus also uses it in the ultra-wide camera of the OnePlus 9. It captures 12.5 megapixel images, combining four pixels in the sensor for every one in the final image.
It’s a quality sensor with a photosensitive area of 1/1.56 inches, much larger than the classic compact camera size. And, of course, this camera benefits from all the computational photography tricks that have levelled up up the best camera phones in recent years. 
As mentioned earlier, Auto HDR is the highlight for me. In shots that need it, the HDR processing brings out so much shadow detail there’s literally nothing left to bring up in Photoshop by manual excavating the shadow areas. And yet, unlike some of the (much) earlier-gen OnePlus phones, the OnePlus Nord 2 never seriously oversteps, which would result in a kind of tonal flattening.
Despite bring exposed for the foreground, the Nord 2 still renders lots of cloud contour detail in the sky
Here’s a good example of where Auto HDR can introduce oversaturation, used to create a sense of contrast in the bright background
Pictures are bold and bright, with some minor over saturation of colour that can be amped up further when HDR works its hardest. Keep the OnePlus Nord 2 on its standard Auto HDR mode and you really can’t go far wrong. Even if you expose the scene to, say, a dark bush in the foreground with a semi-cloudy sky up above and the sun in view, the camera processing can still keep up and avoids almost all overexposure.
This is what you get when a flagship-grade sensor is matched with strong image processing. Are the pictures ultra-realistic and reserved? Not always, no. OnePlus favours a rich, punchy and bright image. But there’s nothing like the camera-wide oversaturation I saw in the Realme 8 Pro.  
While the ultra-wide camera is less impressive, it can still take some pretty pictures
The OnePlus Nord 2 is actually even better at night than the OnePlus 9, in some respects anyway. It brings out more fine detail, exhibits far less noise and produces an overall brighter image. 
The night mode, called simply “Night” in the app, seems to have four seconds no matter how dark the scene is, but the results are very impressive for a 5G Android at this price.
Night performance is great considering the price, with cleaner results than the OnePlus 9
OnePlus’s Nord 2 is one of the more affordable phones with a camera that seems properly equipped to handle any lighting situation, from having almost zero of the stuff to scenes with extremely stark light contrasts.
The primary camera is also optically stabilised, meaning there’s a little motor that tilts the lens to compensate for movement during shooting. This will help with night photography, much as merging of exposures is the real hero in all modern low-light modes in phones.
The OnePlus Nord 2 has one of the more fun-to-use, reliable cameras at this level. But this mostly only applies to the main camera.
Auto HDR is working very hard here, and again we see the use of colour as well as light/dark values to avoid a flatenning of the image
Our ultra-wide has a lower-end 8-megapixel sensor. And while it’s solid next to the many found in £200-300 Androids, there’s a clear step down in quality when you switch to the wide.
Colour tone is cooler, the lower native dynamic range sometimes results in unnatural sky gradients even with OnePlus’s Auto HDR to help. And you can see much more clearly that HDR working, with halos around some objects and a slight tonal flattening at times.
The ultra-wide camera tends to produce colder, less rich images than the primary 50MP camera
The Nord 2’s main camera keeps up with the OnePlus 9’s, and even beats it in some situations. But the ultra-wide is not even close to the excellent cameras on the higher-end OnePlus phones. Still, it’s good to have, can still shoot decent images and compares well enough with other phones in this class.
There are some gripes to note in other areas. The OnePlus 9’s main camera can’t focus particularly close, so is not great for macro photography, but I have managed to get some decent results using the 2X digital zoom mode.
Don’t rely on digital zoom too much for actual zoom shots, though. The app has presets for 2x and 5x, and the latter produces terrible images. They each use a different profile. The 2x gives images a decent-looking wavy patina down at pixel level, but this switches to a strategy of short hard lines (in textures) and massively boosted edge contrast at 5x.
5x zoom shots are almost universally bad
Stay away from natural textures and 5x images become less offensive, but there are masses of ugly sharpening
The OnePlus Nord 2 is miles behind the £250 Realme 8 Pro in this area. That phone offers a masterclass on what can be done with digital zoom in a budget phone.
I also think the Nord 2 is perhaps a little too heavy on noise reduction across the board. While this doesn’t seem to impact fine detail much, natural textures look a little too artificially constructed down at pixel level.
While no macro star, use the Nord 2’s 2x zoom mode if you want to get up close
The smart processing is, however, a big help, in the portrait mode. It produces some of the more convincing background blur effects I’ve seen from a phone, with generally good edge detection and lovely smooth progressive blurring as objects get further away. 
The Nord 2’s blur mode won’t nail an image with tiny and thin plant stems, but Portrait is well worth using. It’s just a shame it’s so picky about how far you are from the subject. You can’t get particularly close, or particularly far away.
While not foolproof the Portrait mode can capture some highly shareable pics
Video capture is also a couple of steps behind the OnePlus 9’s. The OnePlus Nord 2 can shoot 4K video, but only at 30fps rather than 60fps. There is no 8K video mode either, of course. However 4K/30 uses a combination of optical and software (electronic) image stabilisation, to great effect.
While software stabilisation can reduce the wobble of handheld footage, you need OIS to minimise the frame blurring that occurs in lower light from footfall motion. The Nord 2 seems to do this pretty well.
The phone’s selfie camera also has some real chops. It uses a 32MP megapixel sensor, the highest-res one seen in a OnePlus phone yet, as the company was keen to tell us. And we see some of the same tricks used in the main camera.
Dynamic range processing is, again, excellent. No blown-out backgrounds here. And the Nord 2 can even use its four-second Night mode for selfies. However, in most cases you don’t need it. Pixel binning alone seems to allow for better fine facial hair detail than you see in the Night mode, and the results are great even in very poor lighting.
In good lighting, the Nord 2 selfies beat the OnePlus 9’s. In bad lighting, they pretty much steamroll them. OnePlus gets bonus points for this one. It really needn’t need to try so hard with this selfie camera but, for whatever reason, it did.
Battery life
4500mAh battery, the classic OnePlus capacityDisappointing battery lifeExtremely fast charging
The OnePlus Nord 2 would be one of my absolute favourite 2-3 phones of the year so far were it not for one not-so-little thing: battery life.
No OnePlus phone has truly great battery life. The company seems to favour making them perform well 24/7 and relying on the company’s super-fast charging to make you forgive that you might need to give the phone a top-up before a night out. But the are few things I like more in phones than seeing 40-50% battery life by the end of the day.
The OnePlus Nord 2 and its 4500mAh battery don’t even get close. On every day of testing the phone has been left running of the crisp fragments at the bottom of the packet by 9:30pm. Two day use? No chance.

However, my Nord 2 testing period also landed during a UK heatwave, so I will have spent more time with the screen at max brightness and working at hotter-than-average temperatures. To get an idea of whether the Nord 2 has — as it seems to me — at least slightly shorter battery life than the OnePlus 9, I tried a side-by-side test.
I used an app called Generic Battery Drainer to see if the Nord 2 drained more slowly when maxing-out the screen brightness, CPU, GPU, and making calls to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS.
After 22 minutes the OnePlus 9 had lost 11% charge, the Nord 2 16% charge. I had to stop the test at this point because excessive heat made the Nord 2 put a hard lock on the screen brightness, making the comparison unfair. Its “battery temperature” was nearing 50 degrees centigrade while the OnePlus 9 had settled to around 45.8 degrees.
This may less bad than it sounds, as our test room was 28.9 degrees at the time – hardly normal indoor temperatures.
While not conclusive proof of much other than the OnePlus 9 uses juice less quickly under strain, it is in-line with my observations that the Nord 2’s battery life is not great even by OnePlus’s at-best middle-ranking standards.
I also tried a lighter online video streaming test, matching the phones’ screen brightness at roughly mid-level. The OnePlus 9 lost seven percent battery after an hour, the OnePlus Nord 2 nine percent. Its MediaTek chipset may be to blame.   
The OnePlus Nord 2 leans heavily on its 65W charging, which is best-in-class. OnePlus has removed the initial battery health measure of reducing charge speed for the first few minutes (perhaps linked to the shift to a MediaTek chipset), getting you from flat to 50% in 13 minutes. You’re at 98% in 30 minutes and it tips over to 100% in just under 32 minutes.
The big question here is whether you’re happy to forego reliable 1.5-2 day battery life, safe in the knowledge 10 minutes plugged in refills a big chunk the battery. Still, the limited basic stamina does get on my nerves.

Should you buy it?


You want to get as close to a flagship experience as you can get for £400: the Nord 2 fits the bill. You get a strong main camera, good speakers and tip-top performance in Android and its most demanding games.


The OnePlus Nord 2’s battery life is not impressive: While it should last a full day of moderate use, you may find you need to give it a quick top-up on heavier days. It’s slightly higher maintenance than some.










Final Thoughts
The OnePlus Nord 2 is a near-perfect £400 Android phone if you can cope with one thing. Its battery life is not great, and the heavy user will have to occasionally give it a mid-day top-up to avoid evening headaches. OnePlus’s ultra-fast charging makes this less onerous than it might otherwise be, but it’s not ideal.
Still interested? The Nord 2 is a well-made phone with a great primary camera that can even beat the OnePlus 9’s in a few situations. And its selfie camera beats the OnePlus 9’s in all conditions.
General performance is excellent, and it’s perfect for gaming. That’s not just about frame rates, but also the use of good stereo speakers and a bold, bright OLED screen.

Built for gamersThis is a gaming phone with many dedicated features for pushing titles further


Pop up cameraThe selfie camera pops up on the side of the device


High-end specsLots of RAM, high-end chipset and fast display


Introduction
Gaming phones are a relatively new concept in the smartphone world and the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel 2 is one of the latest. The premise is simple, these devices will bring all the power you need to really let loose and game the way you want to, at almost any cost.
The hallmarks are big batteries, brash designs and even bigger screens, with over-the-top specifications in almost every area. 
Lenovo’s latest effort ticks each of these boxes and then some, going further than much of the competition in its attempt to steal the crown of the best phone for gaming.
It has a landscape-first design, RGB lighting, a motorised selfie-camera, dual turbocharging, air triggers and more RAM and storage than most laptops – but is all of this enough? And in the race to be completely over the top, is enough attention paid to the user experience?
The Lenovo Legion Phone Duel 2 is available now directly from Lenovo in the UK and Europe for £699/€799. No word has been given on availability in the USA and other markets. The base model comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, one colour option is available.
Design and Screen
Flat screen with no curvesGorilla Glass 5 on the front and rearMade for landscape use in particular
The word ‘Gamer’ when applied to product design has typically meant one thing over the years, a kind of gaudy, bolshy, Lynx deodorant-style of excess. 
The Legion Phone embraces this look wholeheartedly, but thankfully it does so with a modicum of restraint. 

The device is a tasteful black, and offers little clue from the front that it is in fact a gaming device. 
On the rear, things become a little different, with a central ‘island’ in the middle which contains all of the cameras (all of which are flush with the casing) an RGB ‘Legion’ logo and a small exhaust fan. That this side of the phone is quite a bit uglier than the front is a given, but besides the point. 
This is a device which may not be quite as at home in the boardroom as it is in the living room, but it is certainly an improvement over some of the competition, including the Asus ROG phone.
Looks aside, this is a very large smartphone, one-handed use will be completely out of the question for most. At almost 1cm thick, and weighing in at 259g it is a chunky customer, though the heft is reassuring rather than daunting. This is a device that feels worth the weight and the asking price, with a rock-solid aluminium frame, good build quality and a tough general feel. It is a glass sandwich of course, so we would be very hesitant to subject it to any kind of drop.
So the Legion phone is undoubtedly a gamer phone, however Lenovo has gone a step further in thinking about how these people might use the phone and made inclusions that are not simply skin-deep in terms of their usefulness. 

These include a side-mounted USB-C port which allows for dual fast-charging, or for charging while gaming, and a pop-up selfie camera housed under the power button. The latter will be of particular interest for those who like to stream live while gaming. 
As a bonus, the included fan seems to aid performance somewhat, kicking in quietly when a game is launched and helping to sustain the thermal performance and avoid throttling. 

With a gamer-focussed phone comes an obsession with frame rates and high refresh rates, meaning ultimately how ‘smooth’ the phone will feel in general use. 
Typical smartphone displays refresh the screen around 60 times per second (though many of the best Android phones have already upped this), whereas the Legion phone can go all the way to 144 times per second. What this means is that not only will the smartphone feel faster than those without this function, but that certain mobile games which support the feature will unlock an extra level of performance.
I certainly found the high refresh rate to be pleasant, and coupled with the fast touch sample response rate this is a phone that flies. 
The rest of the display itself is nothing short of cutting-edge and excellent. It expands over 6.92-inches, at a 1080p resolution, offers support for HDR10 content and is an AMOLED panel so delivers infinite blacks and great contrast. 
With no pinhole selfie camera or notch either, the screen is entirely uninterrupted, making this great for watching movies, or indeed gaming.
Camera
Two camera modules, one standard and one wide angleNo optical stabilisationHas a pop-up selfie camera
Though the focus elsewhere is on excess with the Legion phone, there does come a point when cost savings need to be made. 
In this case, it is with the camera – though the system provided does look good on paper, it is clear that imaging performance was in no way intended to match processing performance here.

The Legion Phone Dual 2 comes with two sensors in tow, a 64MP f1.9 main sensor and a 16MP f2.2 ultrawide. Neither offers any fancy auto focusing capabilities, optical image stabilisation, claims for image quality or frills in general. 
This lack of focus can be seen in the camera app, which is somewhat overstuffed and difficult to navigate. Many options are offered, but with little explanation as to what they achieve. An example is ‘HD photo’ which presumably uses the 64MP resolution to provide a more detailed final image, but this is mere speculation. I couldn’t discern any differences using it during testing.
Moving on to image quality, this is a mixed bag as might be expected. In good light, and with an easy subject (such as a building) image quality, within the context of the price point, is satisfactory. 


There is decent detail, reasonable saturation and colours are not overblown like some of the competition. 
Things begin to degrade as the light goes however, with the lack of any image stabilisation meaning that shots lack detail and saturation. 
The situation does improve slightly with the use of the included ‘Night mode’, but here the best camera phones, especially the likes of the iPhone 12, are more accomplished. Things only deteriorate with the wide angle sensor, which showcases reasonable colour and dynamic range but crushes detail with heavy-handed processing.

The selfie camera is especially disappointing, considering it makes such an entertaining entrance. 
I found that the little pop-up sensor prompted envy from family and friends, who were then baffled at the soft, overblown results produced. If you are someone who sets great stock by a selfie, there are again better options available elsewhere, and for a lower price point.
Performance
Runs a Snapdragon 888Comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage by defaultCooling fan included to help with sustained performance
The beating heart of any gaming smartphone is of course its processor. To justify their very existence, they need the best of the best and then some, anything to give some feeling of an edge in use.
Lenovo has equipped the Legion phone, suitably, with the best. It features a Snapdragon 888, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS3.1 storage, more than enough to enjoy the likes of PUBG. In tandem, they make for a phone which is certainly powerful enough to work as a daily device.
Though the phone feels fast, it doesn’t benchmark considerably higher than the competition, even with the use of its cooling fan. It managed a single core score of 1127 and a multi core score of 3724 in Geekbench 5, which is in line with that achieved by other devices sporting a Snapdragon 888. So though there is no real advantage displayed over the competition, the takeaway is that this is a phone with power to spare.
In games, this is aided by an overlay that appears when swiping down. This offers controls over brightness and volume, the ability to boost the fan speed and, more interestingly, the ability to map the air triggers.
Positioned on the top of the device, these act similarly to the equivalent of the triggers on an Xbox or PlayStation controller, and can be mapped to ‘press’ any part of the screen. An example would be a shooting game, the right air trigger can be mapped to the ‘fire’ button, meaning that the trigger can then be used for that function, freeing up screen space.

Though these don’t work on every game, and are sometimes redundant for those built on swipe touch interfaces, they work very well for console-ports and for emulation. As might be expected, the focus on the haptic feedback for these translates to the rest of the device, its haptic response in general is tight and satisfying.
This is the end of the gamer-themed customisations as far as the software is concerned, the rest is a relatively muted skin of Android that doesn’t offend in any way. It is a ‘stock’ themed version, which means that apps are installed on the homescreen, and that there is also an app drawer etc. The settings menu is where the most customisation can be found, offering finer grain controls over the likes of the screen white point and refresh rates.
The front-firing speakers are a pleasant surprise. They are loud, bright, offer some semblance of stereo separation and even some decent bass. I found them to easily be the equal of a £20 Bluetooth speaker, and they are a real treat for watching movies and TV. 
Battery life
5500mAh batteryCapable of ‘dual’ fast chargingComes with a fast charger in the box
It has been said already that the Legion phone is a very large handset, one which easily wears the ugly moniker of ‘phablet’, being big is part of its core identity. 
A pleasant side effect of its extra girth is the easy inclusion of a monster battery pack inside. At 5500mAh it is among the largest available in a device at this price point, and it is definitely needed.

On an average day, I managed around five hours of screen-on time, with a combination of messaging, watching video, listening to music, browsing the internet and indulging in a little mobile gaming. 
So for most people, the Legion Phone Duel 2 will have enough battery to make it through the day and into a second without too much issue.
The situation of course changes with the inclusion of heavier gaming sessions. When playing the likes of PUBG or more intensive titles, power consumption increased considerably, dropping the screen on time by around 90 min in most cases. This is still a solid showing, those looking for long gaming sessions will be well served.
And when the time comes to do a quick top-up, the Legion Phone Duel 2 has a trick up its sleeve in dual fast-charging. 
It can accept two charging cables at once (both of these plus a fast charger are included in the box). With both of these attached and with the compatible fast charger used, I managed to top up over 90% in 30 min, which is very fast indeed. 
Really the only knock against the Legion phone in the battery department is the lack of wireless charging, though whether this qualifies as a flaw will depend heavily on your personal tastes.

Should you buy it?


You are a keen mobile gamer: The Legion phone is a gamer’s dream, offering a host of features and customisation options.


You dislike brash design: There is no attempt at restraint in the design of the Legion phone, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on tastes.









Final Thoughts
Beyond its bold and gaudy exterior lies an exceptionally capable and mostly refined device that is a pleasure to use. Though it is big and bulky, it is solidly built and feels premium in the hand. Its display is a pleasure to use through and through, and the in-built speakers are among the better options available on the market today.

Key Features




Gorilla Glass VictusThis phone has Corning’s top Gorilla Glass, usually only seen in far more expensive handsets.


MIL spec ruggedisationThe Defy has been tested to withstand a number of military-grade toughness criteria, including drop and temperature tests.


Raised screen borderThe outer part of the phone’s casing raises just above the screen in order to avoid accidental display damage. 


Introduction
The Motorola Defy range has been around for almost as long as Android itself. Former Trusted Reviews deputy editor Ed Chester reviewed a phone with exactly the same name a decade ago.
In fact, in terms of ‘pros’ and ‘cons’, the 2021 Motorola Defy is fairly similar. It’s tough, water-resistant and the battery life is pretty good. But the camera is among the weakest we’ve seen in a £279 4G phone in 2021.
There are a bunch of criticisms in this review, but you should take them in the context they’re intended. The Motorola Defy is one of only a few handsets made for ‘rugged’ use, and I’d rather use such a device than an affordable phone with a cumbersome rugged case attached.
Evaluating the Motorola Defy in the correct framing, the main area I’d like to have seen improved is screen brightness. It isn’t super-clear out on bright-but-cloudy days, which may become annoying on work sites or hikes.

The Motorola Defy costs £279 or 279 Euros, which is a pretty good price for a rugged phone.
On the non-rugged side of the market, you could pick up a Motorola Moto G 5G Plus for this sort of money. Of the two I’d opt for the 5G phone, but that’s because I don’t really need a toughened Android.
The Defy is much better-specced than the Cat S42 H+, and it has more up-to-date software than the more expensive Cleyver XSmart 64. It offers better toughness credentials in some areas, too.
The Moto Defy is actually produced by the same company that makes Cat and Land Rover phones, Bullitt. And it may be the best buy of the lot for many, assuming you don’t need the thermal imaging camera of the £540 CAT S62 Pro.
This is an eminently sensible and well-price rugged phone, if the level of toughness it offers is essential, rather than just a ‘nice to have’.

Design and Screen
A tough phone that still feels like a relatively normal AndroidWide operating temperature of -25 to +55ºCGorilla Glass Victus screen protection
Let’s start with the areas that make the Motorola Defy a tough phone. First up is Gorilla Glass Victus, used to cover the screen.
This is a high-end toughened glass typically only used in the world’s most expensive phones, such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. While it isn’t scratch- or shatter-proof, Corning claims it’s twice as scratch-resistant as the previous Gorilla Glass 6. It has also been drop-tested to 2m in height – the glass itself.
The Moto Defy’s glass isn’t only radically better than the Moto G-series phones of a similar price, which don’t even use Gorilla Glass, it’s better than most of the dedicated rugged phones at the price – which tend to have glass lower down the Gorilla Glass series.

I do find it strange that Motorola doesn’t apply a screen protector. It would be useful extra protection, saving that Gorilla Glass Victus hardness for when it’s really needed.
Water-resistance is the Defy’s second rugged ability. Rated at IP68, it’s the highest rating you’ll find on a phone. This means it’s made to withstand submersion in water at a depth of 1.5m for 35 minutes.
Phones don’t offer the next level of water-resistance, 5ATM, so this is the best you can get. Unlike rugged phones of old, the Motorola Defy doesn’t require rubberised flaps to keep it safe, since headphone jacks and USB-C ports can be made water-resistant.
I’d like to see Motorola specify IP65 resistance, too, which signifies protection from water jets. But only the top rating gets a mention. 

As ever, however, if you drop the Defy and deform the outer at all, you should assume its water resistance may have been compromised. The phone’s speaker also isn’t that well geared up to life around water. While water doesn’t appear to damage it, even slight contact with it neuters the sound, and it can take some time to go back to normal. There’s no clever drainage system and you can’t dry it off yourself easily.
Military-spec testing is the other important rugged factor. This is a qualitative way to make the chunky rubberised plastic outer seem worthwhile.
Motorola says the phone is “drop-proof” at a height of 1.8m and, just as important, has a wider operating temperature range than the average Android. It can be used in environments from -25ºC to +55ºC. The Samsung Galaxy S21’s operating range is zero to 35ºC.
The weather wasn’t scorching in London when I used the Defy, so I couldn’t see if the phone tends to overheat in direct sunlight, as the OnePlus Nord CE 5G did a few weeks before. But that’s a good temperature range.

There are other notable design touches, too. The Motorola Defy has a slight lip over the screen, where the sides raise above the display glass. This offers extra screen protection if you place the phone down on a slightly rough surface.
The Defy also has a little cord loop bar in one of the bottom corners, plus an elasticated wrist strap in the box.
All that toughness ensures the Motorola Defy isn’t a phone we’d describe as attractive. It’s larger than a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, despite having a much smaller screen. However, unlike most of the rugged phones I’ve used before the Defy, it still largely feels like a normal phone. It doesn’t have ridiculously prominent or contoured parts.

The Motorola Defy initially seems like it has a large screen, but that’s an illusion brought about by the phone’s XL-size dimensions. It’s a 6.5-inch LCD with a 1600 x 720-pixel resolution, which is well below what I’d usually expect to see at £275.
Sharpness is sound enough, but it’s an obvious downgrade from a Full HD phone. Colour and contrast are fine, if nothing special; they’re typical of what you might expect from a sub-£200 Moto phone.

There are other signs that the Motorola Defy screen is a C-grade display. It suffers from a very obvious loss of brightness at an angle, and its maximum brightness of 450 nits isn’t as good as most of the non-rugged phones around the price. 
I’m not surprised by any of this. Ruggedisation doesn’t come for free, and Motorola is clearly out to make a phone that doesn’t come with the jump in price that often accompanies such phones.
Performance
Pleasant day-to-day performancePoor for gamingNo 5G mobile internet
You see a little of this compromise in the Moto Defy’s processor, too. It’s the Qualcomm Snapdragon 662, which was announced in 2020. This is a generation older than some of the phones you might buy at this level.
Does it matter? In most cases, no. The Motorola Defy suffers from no serious lag. Jumping around the Android 10 software feels fairly similar to doing so on non-rugged phones that cost this much.
Real-world general performance is similar to the Moto G50, which is a good thing. However, the Motorola Defy doesn’t have 5G mobile internet, just 4G and below. This should come as no surprise. Even among everyday phones, manufacturers need to make quite clear compromises in design and camera tech to fit in 5G at this price. It’s the same here, but for ruggedisation rather than 5G. 

The next important question: can it play Fortnite? It’s one of Android’s toughest games. If a phone can play Fortnite well, it can usually handle just about everything else.
Run Fortnite at its maximum setting, Medium in this case, and while it’s just about playable, there were frequent frame rate drops to 13-14fps. This resulted in obvious juddering. These troughs can be flattened a bit by dropping down to Low graphics and reducing the dynamic resolution setting, but the Defy doesn’t have enough power to make the game shine.
The slightly less graphically intense ARK: Survival Evolved runs okay at its default Medium graphics, but becomes judddery if you bump up the visuals to Epic. This isn’t a great gaming phone, but it’s significantly better than the Cat S42 H+.
Camera
Limited photo quality, particularly up closeSolid enough HDR processing helps make up for mediocre hardwareMax 1080p video: no 4K mode
The Motorola Defy looks like it has a decent camera array from a glance, but it’s a mirage.
Its 48-megapixel primary camera is the only unit with anything approaching a reasonably good-quality sensor. The other two are a poor 2-megapixel macro and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. This isn’t used directly for taking photos, but lets the Defy shoot images where the background is blurred out for an arty look.
You don’t get an ultra-wide camera or a zoom here.

The Motorola Defy has one of the worst primary cameras I’ve used this year in a phone at this price. Even in good lighting, images have a ‘painted’ appearance up-close. This is the result of fairly aggressive picture processing, and means fine detail may be much worse than you’d expect looking at that “48 megapixel” sensor resolution. For the sensor nerds out there, it’s the Samsung GM1.
There are other issues, too. The Defy suffers from shutter lag, which makes a camera feel less responsive. And the preview image in the camera app isn’t as clear as that of some ‘normal’ phones around the price.
While the processing is heavy-handed on detail, it’s also a bit of a slouch in terms of contrast, pop and brightness. Images can end up looking dull and, compared to the norm of at least slightly over-saturated colour, low on vibrancy. I don’t mind this flatter approach, though: the “Enhance” editing button in Google Photos can supply that, and I’m glad the Motorola Defy doesn’t tend to radically over brighten photos taken under a canopy of trees.
Fine detail isn’t very good, but the Defy takes a good stab at exposing all sorts of scenes
The Defy’s photos don’t look great up-close, but tend to appear fine zoomed out


The camera may not be great, but Auto HDR mode keeps cloud contour detail looking good
Photos taken with the 2-megapixel macro are poor
The Defy’s camera is fairly poor, then, but there are some things to appreciate. It still offers solid dynamic range enhancement, which brings out the contours in clouds rather than blowing the sky out entirely.
You also get Motorola’s Night Vision mode, which significantly improves dynamic range and brightness in very low-light conditions. Still, low-light images remain fairly poor. 
The Defy’s video capture is limited. Its maximum resolution is 1080p, and while there is a 60fps mode, you only get image stabilisation at 30fps. I recommend using the 1080/30 mode for most situations.
An 8-megapixel Samsung sensor is used for the selfie camera. It can take sharp-looking pictures in direct sunlight, but they take a turn for the soft and indistinct when working with less light.
Battery life
Very good staminaSlow charging
The Motorola Defy has a 5000mAh battery, just like the Moto G50 and Moto G30. Stamina is very good, perhaps just slightly under that of the Moto G50, likely because that phone has a newer, more efficient CPU.

I have no complaints, mind. I have regularly ended a day with around 40% remaining, so the Defy should last plenty of people the 36 hours that effectively constitutes two-day use.
You could argue a phone such as this could really do with a giant 6000mAh or 7000mAh battery – and you’d have a point. But the unavoidable increase in chunkiness would make me want to use the Defy much less than I currently do.
The Motorola Defy’s charging speed is fairly poor, even though its 20W charger qualifies it as a ‘fast charge’ phone. It takes 2hrs 19mins minutes to get from flat to 100%, and it’s a way off the traditional fast-charge standard of 50% in 30 minutes, reaching just 33% after being plugged in for half an hour.

Should you buy it?


You want a reasonably priced ultra-rugged phone: The Defy’s price and features are better balanced than most Cat and Range Rover rivals. You get real rugged capabilities without having to spend a fortune. 


If you don’t need ruggedisation: The Defy comes with a relatively weak processor and a poor camera, making it a poor choice if you don’t truly need its tough design.









Final Thoughts
The Motorola Defy is an excellent phone for someone who needs the three pillars of ruggedisation: drop-proofing, water-resistance and a wide operating temperature range. Its price is entirely reasonable, battery life is good and the use of Gorilla Glass Victus is particularly noteworthy.

Key Features




21:9 OLED displayThe distinctive tall screen is great for video


Battery lifeThe endurance here is great thanks to a 4500mAh battery


Clean AndroidSony’s version of Android is good looking and free of bloat


Introduction
Last year’s three-strong Xperia II range offered tantalising glimpses of a resurgent Sony, one that’s willing and able to corral its formidable but scattered expertise to produce great smartphones. 
By far the least impressive of those three phones was the mid-priced Sony Xperia 10 II, in more ways than one. While it was neat and tidy enough, it failed to compete with its sub-£400 contemporaries or excel in some key areas.
Now the Sony Xperia 10 III is here with a similarly classy package, added 5G support, and one or two tweaks to the formula. At a new higher price of £399 / €429, is it good enough to go toe to toe with the likes of the Poco F3 and the OnePlus Nord? Here’s what we found testing it.
Design and screen
Classy and unique look21:9 OLED great for movies, a bit cramped for everything elseOnly a 60Hz refresh rate
Mid-range phones don’t tend to be that pretty, but the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G recently showed that cheap needn’t mean nasty.
To be fair to Sony, the Xperia 10 II proved something similar in 2020, offering the kind of poise and class that seems to come from a higher level of phone entirely. The Sony Xperia 10 III follows the same path.
It’s another clean, symmetrical, undemonstrative handset with little in the way of frippery. Just about the most ostentatious thing about it is the superfluous addition of a dedicated (and sadly unmappable) Google Assistant button on the right hand edge.

On the opposite edge sits another touch that’s unique to Sony – a SIM tray that doesn’t require a tool to remove. This is heaven if you’re someone who’s constantly juggling SIMs, and there are two neatly separated SIM slots to boot.
Otherwise you’ve got Gorilla Glass 6 sandwiching what appears to be a metallic frame. That’s another classy touch at a price point where shiny plastic gets an all-too-frequent outing. Our Black model is the stealthiest of the lot, but you can also get the Xperia 10 III in White, Blue, or Pink, depending on your region.
The phone’s forehead and chin are a tad thicker than you might be accustomed to, but the fact that they’re equally proportioned counts for a lot. Most importantly, it enables Sony to stash the selfie camera in the top bezel rather than a cut-out notch, making for a completely unbroken display.
In hand this is quite a small phone, with a slim but proportionally tall footprint of 154 x 68mm, and a modest thickness of 8.3mm. It weighs just 169g, too, which is quite light for a phone this size.
I found it really does feel very well built, and that point is driven home by an IP68 dust/water resistance rating. That’s far from a common spec to find in a phone this far south of £700.
As per Sony’s preference, the Sony Xperia 10 III features a side-mounted fingerprint sensor. It’s not as showy as the in-display alternatives, but in my experience it generally proves to be quicker and more reliable. Here there’s a definite sense of lag, but that seems to reflect the phone’s sluggish performance rather than a shortfall in Sony’s biometric tech.
Sony has lived up to its audio-centric reputation with a headphone jack on the top of the device, but it blots its copybook somewhat by not including stereo speakers. Both the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G and the Poco F3 offer this for around the same money, so pricing is no excuse. This means audio quality isn’t as powerful, so you’ll definitely want to use earphones if you want to watch video on the phone.
The Sony Xperia 10 III’s display offers mixed blessings. It’s not the biggest screen on the market at 6-inches, and when you factor in that extra-tall and thin 21:9 aspect ratio, things like web content can look a little cramped. But widescreen movie content and games look great, especially with no annoying selfie cam islands or curved edges to distract your attention.

A resolution of 1080 x 2520 (FHD+) means that the picture is nice and sharp for the size, while OLED panel technology means that colours really pop. The default offerings of ‘Original’ and ‘Standard’ are perhaps a little warm and cool respectively, but it is possible to fine-tune things in an impressively nuanced White Balance menu.
The biggest letdown here by far is the provision of a miserly 60Hz refresh rate. Rival phones at this price will often give you the option of 90Hz or 120Hz, making for a much more fluid navigation experience. 
With the Sony Xperia 1 III going above and beyond the call of duty with its own 4K 120Hz provision in the super-flagship space, it’s a shame that the Sony Xperia 10 III couldn’t similarly lead the way for lower-mid-range phones. Yes, Apple is still using 60Hz in its expensive flagships, but overall this feels like a bit of a missed opportunity and will put off buyers coming off competing high refresh rate phones.
Camera
12MP sensor fine in good light, terrible in low lightSluggish shooting speedsTelephoto lens
Sony appears to have changed very little with the Sony Xperia 10 III’s camera set-up. Just like its predecessor you get a nicely balanced three-camera system with no superfluous depth sensors or macro lenses. It shouldn’t feel like such a breath of fresh air, but it does.

This is led by the same 12MP 1/2.8″ wide sensor as the Xperia 10 II, albeit this time with a brighter f/1.8 aperture. Backing this once again is a pair of 8MP 1/4.0″ sensors, one a 2x telephoto and one a 120-degree ultrawide.
It probably shouldn’t surprise you to learn that the shooting experience itself is pretty familiar. Based on my tests, you’re getting a fundamentally sound performer in general daylight conditions and an underwhelming offering elsewhere. 
In general, when taking basic photos I found Sony’s even color science is the camera’s defining feature. It lets the phone capture realistic images which is rare in the mid-range market where hyper-exaggerated colors are in vogue. Some people will find this approach a little dull and disappointing, and shots taken with the Xperia 10 III certainly aren’t as immediately Istagrammable as, say, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G. But others will prefer Sony’s more naturalistic ‘as you see it’ philosophy.
Not that the main Xperia 10 III camera is technically superior. It can still struggle with balancing the tone of a scene, and with HDR. On bright days, highlights such as bright skies will tend to be blown out, while on particularly muggy and overcast days I found that many of my shots were dim and murky.


It’s particularly disappointing to see that there’s still an issue with the time it takes between hitting the shutter button and the camera app responding. Like the Xperia 10 II, it’s all very sluggish, which could conceivably lead to you missing those opportunistic snapshots. Again, when the Sony Xperia 1 III has pretty much the fastest camera around, it’s a shame that its affordable brother hasn’t been built in the same image.

The Ultrawide camera
It’s really good to see a dedicated telephoto sensor here, though. Rival efforts such as the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G, the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G, and the OnePlus Nord all omit such a component. The results are far from spectacular, with a tone that’s notably cooler than the main sensor, alongside the obvious step down in detail. But merely having a proper telephoto option rather than employing a cropping algorithm is a victory in my book. 
2X zoom
The 8MP ultrawide seems to get closer to the main sensor when it comes to tone, if rather more on the warm side. But things also get a little soft and fuzzy, especially towards the edges. This is normal in a more affordable phone, of course, and it’s far from the worst example I’ve used.
Again, this is all fine for an affordable phone. Only the Google Pixel 4a really offers an outright compelling photographic experience at this money, and that phone’s missing a fair few bells and whistles of its own.
Shooting at night is a bit of a wash out with the Sony Xperia 10 III, unfortunately. Using the included Night mode yields extremely grainy, fuzzy shots, and extreme low light scenarios are a complete sludgy mess. Sony’s natural approach ensures you don’t get the freaky brightening of some rival affordable phones, which can pay off when using the mode in less extreme or artificially lit situations, but you’ll have to think hard about your framing and keep a very steady hand.

There’s no OIS here, which doubtless contributes to this failure. While that’s far from a given at this price, it’s not unheard of either: the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G features OIS, for example, and takes way better night shots into the bargain.
Selfies from the Xperia 10 III’s 8MP front camera are a little on the soft side, and they also tend to struggle with HDR implementation. Portrait selfies, in particular, seem very hit and miss with their implementation and yield weird edge artefacts. You’re much better off hitting the bokeh control button for the main camera and switching control to the volume key for your arty self-snaps, awkward as that may be.

On the video front, the phone is capable of 4K at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps. Again, a lack of OIS means your footage isn’t going to be the steadiest.
Performance
Snapdragon 690 a big improvement, but still not particularly competitive6GB RAM a 50% boost from last year’s modelSony’s take on Android 11 is clean and considered
Sony has given the Xperia 10 III a considerable speed boost over last year’s Xperia 10 II, courtesy of a newer Snapdragon 690 5G chip and a 50% increase in RAM to 6GB. 
Given that performance was Trusted’s biggest issue with the Sony Xperia 10 II, this can be seen as an essential move from Sony. In day to day usage, it’s definitely an improvement, despite the lack of a fluid display refresh rate.
But it still doesn’t quite feel fast enough for the money in an even more competitive field. The facts and figures back that up: a Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 1717 positions it behind more modestly performing rivals like the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and the OnePlus Nord, let alone the flagship-bothering Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G and Poco F3 which can add more than 1000 to that score.
It’s an even worse story on the GPU front, with 3DMark scores that place the Sony Xperia 10 III below considerably cheaper phones like the Oppo A54 5G and the Realme 8. It’s not a good look in a £400 phone.
In practical gaming terms, PUBG Mobile defaults to Medium and High Refresh Rate, which is pretty normal for the current £400 crop. It’s not the smoothest experience, but it’s perfectly adequate.
Elsewhere there’s a decent allowance of 128GB internal storage – double the Xperia 10 II’s provision – and you can still expand that through a microSD slot. Another addition to this year’s model is 5G connectivity, which makes the Xperia 10 III rather more future-proof.
Android 11 runs well on the Sony Xperia 10 III, helped no end by Sony’s careful take on Google’s mobile OS. There’s way less of the unwanted apps, the clunky icons, and the clumsy customisations than with most of its mid-range rivals.

Where Sony does go the extra mile, it’s generally well considered. Take, for example, the ability to run two apps one on top of the other with a double tap of a side-bar button, taking full advantage of that unusually tall display.
It doesn’t work anywhere near as well as on the larger, sharper, more fluid screen of the Sony Xperia 1 III, but then that phone is three times the price. This is a solid take on that premium feature.
I should note that I observed a weird bug with the Xperia 10 III whereby embedded videos were weirdly stuttery and almost slow motion. Hopefully that gets fixed with a near-future firmware update.
Battery life
4500mAh battery is a big upgradeModerate use gets you two days of juiceSlow 7.5w charger included
Sony has wisely fitted the Xperia 10 II with a much larger battery than before. Moving to a 4500 mAh cell (up from 3600 mAh) is a smart move, if only to pay the infamous 5G tax.
The result of this larger battery, alongside that small 60Hz display, is that the Xperia 10 III lasts an awful long time in between charges. I found that I was able to get through a 15 hour day with around 5 hours of screen on time, and still have about 50% left in the tank.

Yes, the potential for two days of usage on a single charge is very real, and it’s something the far more expensive Sony Xperia 1 III can’t get close to. That two day potential will rapidly disappear if you go heavy on the media, or spend a lot of time flitting between ropey 4G and 5G networks, but then that’s the case with any phone.
While the Sony Xperia 10 III apparently supports 30W charging, you don’t get that provision in the box. Instead, Sony has provided a really slow 7.5W power brick. I recorded an excruciating 0 to 50% time of 1 hour 12 minutes, and just under 3 hours (2 hours 57 to be precise) for a full 0 to 100%.

Should you buy it?


You want a stylish, symmetrical design: The Xperia 10 III’s design is uniquely clean and balanced, with no notch and an appealing hand-feel


You want a fluid screen: It’s quite possible to get a 90Hz or 120Hz OLED display in a phone of this price, so the Xperia 10 III’s 60Hz effort feels a little sluggish









Final Thoughts
The Sony Xperia 10 III is a uniquely equipped mid-ranger with a polished design, an unusually wide (and blissfully unobstructed) OLED display, and stellar battery life. But its performance falls well behind similarly priced rivals, and combined with the lack of a suitably fluid display, there’s been a disappointing lack of progress in some fundamental areas.

Impressive displayThe 6.67-inch OLED panel has a 144Hz refresh rate


Introduction
In the past few years, we’ve seen a host of Chinese manufacturers capture a significant foothold in the Western market with an avalanche of sensibly specced and aggressively priced devices. Of these, ZTE is a relatively new entrant, and with the ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G it’s attempting to create a new product category: the ‘mid-range ultra’.
That is to say, this is a device that doesn’t skimp on the specifications yet comes in at a very tantalising price point, similar to devices in our best mid-range phone list.
These specs include a 144Hz 1080p AMOLED screen, a Snapdragon 888, three cameras that each clock in at 64 megapixels, a periscope zoom sensor and much more. This is a phone looking to go toe-to-toe with the likes of the Samsung S21 Ultra, and for a far more wallet-friendly outlay.
Whether this is simply a niche too far in what is already an oversaturated market is yet to be seen. With the premium mid-range, the flagship killer, the ultra, and more already established popular segments, does the Axon Ultra do enough to set itself aside from the competition and attract the attention of the public?
The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G is available now directly from ZTE for prices starting at £649/$749/€749 for a combination with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of memory. Black is the only colour option currently available.
Design and screen
Thin design with a tall aspect ratioThe screen curves at the sidesA large distinctive camera bump on the rear
‘Premium’ in product design isn’t anything concrete, it’s only a feeling. Yet a premium feel is essential to justify the price of a product deemed as high-end; such devices can’t just walk the catwalk, they need to own it.
The Axon 30 Ultra certainly has everything it needs to hang with the best phones from an aesthetic perspective. 

There’s the trendy, tall aspect ratio screen, a centred pinhole selfie camera, and an under-display fingerprint scanner on the front. In addition, it has a shiny aluminium frame and nice clicky buttons – which are all great, but par for the course at this price. 
On the rear, things become a little more interesting, with the addition of a large camera ‘island’.

This is where all four of the rear sensors live, housed in a large glass rectangle – with some bolshy branding stating ‘3 x 64MP’, ‘NEOVISION’ and more, doing its best to ruin things. 
The back itself is composed of a sheet of Gorilla Glass 5, which pulls double duty on the front of the device, too. Although this isn’t the latest and greatest protective glass on the market, it will likely prove to be plenty tough for most.
As is often the case with a ‘glass sandwich’ design, the Axon Ultra deserves plaudits for the grace and readiness with which it dives off any available surface. As such, a case will be a sensible choice for those who like to keep their device in a presentable state.
Glass issues aside, this is a phone that feels like it will take a few knocks in its stride, if not too many. There’s little if any flex when pressure is applied, and the well-balanced nature of the design makes one-handed use relatively achievable – the mammoth proportions of the display aside. 
This is only aided further by the 8mm thin profile, and the 188g weight – both of which are relatively svelte in this age of gargantuan smartphones.
So the Axon Ultra passes the ‘premium’ test on the outside. Some questionable choices on the rear aside, this is a device that will feel at home almost anywhere. It’s comfortable in general use and appears mostly worth the price of admission. However, a premium ‘feel’ isn’t just the impression the device leaves in the hand, but a question of experience too.
Luckily, the positive impression made by the body is carried over to the display. A 1080p 6.6-inch 144Hz AMOLED HDR panel, it has all the buzzwords necessary to make spec-heads a little hot under the collar. That combination also means that this is a panel that suffers no real faults.

The high refresh rate is the first to catch the eye, since it makes the process of navigating through the UI exceptionally smooth. 
By default, the Axon 30 Ultra 5G has the refresh rate set to ‘Auto’, which means that it will analyse your use case and attempt to pick the best speed for each situation, with the intent of preserving battery life. I found this to be mostly useful, although this mode tends to default to 90Hz in most cases. There is the option to force a specific rate throughout the system – although, again, it will be at the cost of battery life.
In bright sunlight, the Axon Ultra remains very viewable as a result of the bright AMOLED display technology. I also found that it could easily become dim enough for a little bedtime reading. Although it would have been nice to see a 2K display for the price, a 1080p resolution proves to be more than sufficient for everyday use, with the added benefit of lowering the draw on both the processor and the battery.
If you’re someone who watches a lot of TV on their device, the Axon 30 Ultra will be a treat, and likely one of the best screens you’ll own.
Camera
Four camera modules covering various focal lengthsTwo lenses are optically stabilisedA host of dedicated camera modes are available
At the highest level of the smartphone ‘ecosystem’, the main means by which manufacturers differentiate their devices is through camera performance. In particular at the ‘Ultra’ level, this will mean that each device will generally match the others in terms of the raw specification, but will also try to add something a little different – the 10x zoom lens of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, for example.

The Axon Ultra opts for a mix of these two approaches. The main sensor is 64 megapixels and optically stabilised. There’s a 64-megapixel ultrawide lens and an 8-megapixel 5x telephoto in tow, too. 
So far, so similar to the rest of the best camera phone crowd. Interestingly, however, there’s a 64-megapixel sensor at a 35mm lens length equivalent – a popular portrait length – that’s the focus of this device. So, in theory, the Axon 30 Ultra comes with a full bag of lenses that covers a variety of useful shot lengths.
In total, I counted 13 separate shooting modes, ranging from the useful ‘Night’ mode, to the esoteric ‘Watermark’ to the useless ‘Moon’ mode. Navigating through the camera app is generally easy and quick; however, I found the plethora of available options to be somewhat confusing – and this certainly got in the way when I was trying to take a quick shot.
Focusing, too, proved to be something of a mixed bag. In static environments, and at night, it was fine. Trying to photograph a hyperactive toddler or puppy proved to be a far less productive endeavour, however, producing a suite of blurred images.
In general, the picture quality is pleasant, but with a few caveats. Colour reproduction is a strong suit, going the way of Samsung’s warm, almost tropical tones; but it was overdone in some situations, with too much emphasis on reds, in particular. Dynamic range proved to be strong, too, managing to capture subtleties of light in a sunset with ease.

Detail is again a mixed bag – although there is plenty of it, we found that fine textures tended to be negatively affected by the heavy-handed sharpening and noise reduction applied in processing. As is to be expected at the price, there’s also a noticeable difference in white point between the lenses, leaving each with its own distinct profile but with little uniformity across the shooting experience.
Images from the main sensor are understandably the best from an absolute perspective, showcasing the best dynamic range, colour and detail. 
The 35mm Portrait lens does a decent job as a dedicated people snapper, producing images with pleasant colours and detail – even if the edge detection is a little off on occasion. It also pulls double duty when zooming to 2x and beyond in the app, which aids detail at this focal length when compared to an image crop.
The 5x zoom
Images from the 5x telephoto aren’t quite up there with the best, even though they do showcase decent detail. Compared to the main sensor they’re smudgy and grainy – but, once again, are better than any crop.
The ultrawide does plenty to justify its existence, showcasing very comparable detail, dynamic range and colour when compared to the main sensor.
The ultrawide camera
As the light levels drop, performance continues to be mostly good. Utilising the included Night mode yields results with good sharpness, detail, colour and dynamic range. While it doesn’t quite reach the same heights achieved by the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12, the Axon Ultra remains dependable even in more difficult conditions. The same can’t be said of the included Moon mode, which simply pastes an image of the moon into the shot.
The moon mode is fairly useless
So the Axon Ultra will prove to be a dependable photographic companion for most. It has the capabilities to be useful almost anywhere, even if its software is a little more heavy-handed and clunky than the competition.

At the level the ZTE Axon 30 Ultra sits, entirely smooth, hiccup-free performance is expected as a given. And for a device sporting the latest Snapdragon 888 chipset along with 8GB of RAM, so well it should be.
In general use this proved to be the case with the ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G; there’s very little that Android can offer that will faze the likes of the Snapdragon 888. Whether simply whizzing through the interface or firing up an intensive game such as PUBG, it never slowed down even a little. For power users and generalists alike, this is a phone that has grunt to spare.
While this is the case, the Axon Ultra also builds up quite a sweat when pushing harder. Although the device never became uncomfortable to hold, it certainly became toasty under a sustained heavy workload. Running Geekbench 5 to benchmark, it achieved a single-core score of 1110 and a multi-core score of 3558 – both par for the course with this chipset. A base storage level of 128GB is offered, which will likely be sufficient for most. Plus, all options are UFS 3.1, which should aid speedy performance in the long-run.
The phone runs MyOS
Software is an interesting story. ZTE hails from a part of the world where Android is deeply customised by manufacturers, sometimes becoming almost unrecognisable. This was the company’s tendency in the past; however, things have definitely changed for the better.
MyOS is ZTE’s latest take on how to improve the Android experience – and, for the most part, it’s pleasant and stutter-free. There are no ads, no attempts to push custom apps and app stores, and little direct imitation of iOS. The most obvious change over stock Android is in the notification shade, which offers a selection of buttons that look similar to those soon to arrive with Android 12.
A number of useful customisations are on offer, too, such as the ability to change the white point of the screen, to activate an auto-equaliser and more. While it isn’t the most distinctive or interesting software, it’s certainly inoffensive, which is a pleasant change to the likes of MIUI you’ll find on the Xiaomi Mi 11.
No word is given by the manufacturer on the number of long-term software updates the device will receive, however. As a general rule, Android devices will receive around two years of feature and security updates following their original release. This has improved recently, with the likes of Samsung offering four years of updates for its devices. ZTE offers no such promises for the Axon 30 Ultra, so this may not be the most sustainable device for the long-term – and, as a consequence, it may not hold its resale value.
A final positive note is the performance of the built-in stereo speakers. These aren’t exactly best in class, but they’re loud, deliver decent bass, and offer enough oomph and sparkle to make watching videos and listening to music a pleasant experience without the need for a Bluetooth speaker. 
Battery life
4600mAh batteryCapable of 65W fast chargingComes with a fast charger in the box
Big screens and fast refresh rates bring significant challenges in terms of battery life. As devices are becoming more powerful in almost every way, the garden variety phone battery is facing more challenges than ever before.
There are two solutions to prevent this from impacting the user experience: large battery packs and fast charging – and the Axon 30 Ultra offers both. 
The 4600mAh battery is hardly the largest such unit to be fitted in a phone, but this is likely due to the potential impact on the size of the device. 
In general, I was able to make it through a 16-hour day with a little left in the tank. This was with regular messaging, email, Bluetooth audio, around an hour of videos, and snapping a few photos throughout the day. With more demanding use cases you’ll run out of juice sooner.

Thankfully, this isn’t much of an issue, due to the inclusion of both fast-charging tech and a fast charger in the box. 
Using the fast charger you can top up by 70% in just 30 minutes; it isn’t the fastest, but it’s certainly enough for most people. If you’re the kind to forget the odd overnight charge, or find yourself needing a quick top-up, this will be a lifesaver.

Should you buy it?


You want great looks and performance for a relatively low asking price: Compared to some of the other ‘Ultra’ and ‘Pro’ phones around the Axon 30 Ultra is fairly affordable and it has the specs to match the pricier rivals.


You want the absolute best camera performance: There’s a lot going on in terms of camera specs here, however the processing isn’t the best and some of the extra modes are best left alone.









Final Thoughts
The ZTE Axon 30 Ultra 5G is an intriguing addition to the smartphone market. 
It strives hard to create its own special niche, and is very convincing in its efforts. With a capable, versatile camera arrangement, an excellent screen, decent speakers, fast performance, good battery life and more, it at least matches the competition in most ways, if never exceeding it. 
While it can’t quite match the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or iPhone 12 Pro Max in any particular area, it comes super-close, and it does so at roughly 65% of the price of both. Anyone looking for a little more from their next smartphone who doesn’t wish to break the £/$1k barrier should definitely keep the Axon 30 Ultra in mind. In aiming for the moon, ZTE has achieved something notable – but for the lack of long-term updates, this would be an instant recommendation.

An abbreviation for milliampere-hour and a way to express the capacity of batteries, especially smaller ones in phones. In most cases the higher the mAh, the longer the battery will last but this isn’t always the case.


OLED
																OLED stands for Organic Light Emitting Diode. It’s a display made up of self emissive pixels, each of which can create its own light. A bright pixel can sit next to a dark pixel to help create deep black levels and high contrast beyond that of traditional displays. The lack of a backlight also means these displays can be thinner than other types of TVs.

Clean AndroidNokia has one of the cleanest Android skins, with multiple years of promised updates and no bloatware


CameraNokia has teamed up with Zeiss for the camera


Introduction
At a time when confidence in our tech companies is at an all time low, it’s easy to find yourself yearning for simpler times when a nigh-on indestructible Nokia phone would do what you asked of it – and nothing more – for years at a time.
The Finnish company’s hegemonic heyday may be firmly in the rearview mirror, but local custodian HMD Global is keen to capitalise on the lingering sentiment for the brand. Enter the Nokia X20 – the sales pitch for which can be summarised as: “We’re Nokia. You can trust us”.
You’re getting a solid design, 5G connectivity, clean software, and the promise of three years of Android updates in a package that costs only £299/ €349. This focus on dependability over all else is both refreshing and reassuring, but other areas have been neglected in the process.
With the likes of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G and the Poco F3 offering better performance for similar money, the less risk-averse will find better prospects elsewhere.
Design and Screen
Tidy plastic bodyQuite thick and heavyPoor 60Hz LCD
The Nokia X20 is the top model in HMD Global’s most recent range, but don’t think of it as a flagship. This is still a phone aiming for the best cheap phone crown and it’s all plastic.
Still, reliability and durability are very much the operative words here. As part of its press push, Nokia included a video highlighting the various forms of torture the company had put its latest phone through. Buttons, ports and the phone’s chassis were all subjected to various mechanical stress tests, while basic IPX2 certification ensures it will stand up to a light shower.
This would seem to explain the reasons that the Nokia X20 is such a tank of a phone. A 168.9 x 79.7mm footprint means that it isn’t especially large head-on, but a thickness of 9.1mm makes it rather chunky. Meanwhile, an official weight of 220g is very heavy indeed for a budget-mid-range device; it’s more in line with super-phones such as the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra.
For all that, the Nokia X20 is pretty tidy to look at in either Nordic Blue (the review model) or Midnight Sun. Its rear plastic cover is unflashy, with gently curved edges and a matte finish that doesn’t completely dispel greasy footprints, but doesn’t highlight them too much either.

The front of the phone is your typical all-screen affair with a central hole-punch selfie camera, although the bezels are perhaps a little thicker than I’d have liked, and the chunky chin even more so. This isn’t a budget phone, remember.
There are a few points to note about the edges of the phone, which are formed of a slightly glossier plastic. On the right edge is a fingerprint sensor stashed within an indented power button, which is far more reliable than most equivalent in-display methods, if not very fast.

On the left edge, dead-opposite that power/fingerprint button, is a dedicated Google Assistant button. It’s an interesting inclusion in a phone that seems committed to paring things right back – perhaps HMD wanted to emphasise its commitment to the stock Android cause. But it’s rather superfluous in a world of ‘OK Google’ audible cues and power button shortcuts.
Still, it would be churlish to complain about such a hardware inclusion. What’s more galling is the omission of stereo sound, with just a single speaker positioned along the bottom edge. It’s quite possible to get such a feature in a £300-400 phone, as we’ve seen with the Poco F3, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G.
While HMD clearly put the X20 through the wringer, one area it perhaps didn’t test quite so diligently was the phone’s signal reception. My flat doesn’t have the best signal, but I experienced intermittent signal drop-outs to a greater extent than with many other recent handsets. It’s hard to be scientific about this – there are so many variables when it comes to mobile signal issues – but this was my experience.
Perhaps my favourite design feature here is the bundled case. Rather than the usual rubbery plastic cover that you’ll inevitably cast aside, the Nokia X20’s freebie is made of a compostable material with the kind of stylishly flecked finish that you might expect to see on a funky kitchen counter.
The included case
Sticking with the eco-friendly theme, if you register your X20’s IMEI number, Ecologi will plant 20 trees for you. While the non-inclusion of a power brick grates somewhat, Nokia is at least paying more than mere lip service to going green.
Moving on to the X20’s display; it’s hardly a prime component. It might be protected by robust Corning Gorilla Glass 5, but the screen technology itself is somewhat lacking.
It’s plenty big enough at 6.67 inches, and it isn’t lacking for pixels with a 1080 x 2400 (FHD+) resolution. But it’s only an IPS LCD rather than an AMOLED panel, and it only refreshes at 60Hz.
Contrast that with the Poco F3 or the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, which both manage to include similarly large and sharp AMOLEDs with 120Hz refresh rates, and the comparison doesn’t exactly flatter the X20. But really, most £300-400 Android phones will give you either AMOLED or an elevated refresh rate.

Whether it’s this 60Hz refresh rate or the Nokia X20’s underwhelming performance (likely to be a bit of both), flicking between homescreens and scrolling through web pages feels laggy and ponderous in a way that it simply doesn’t on rival handsets.
Camera
64MP main sensor takes crisp, bright shots5MP ultrawide lacks detailLots of Pro features, but no OIS
The Nokia X20 might lack a little in general specification terms, but its main 64-megapixel camera stands its ground pretty well. I was able to take bright, crisp shots in good lighting, with HMD’s effective auto-HDR generally reining in extreme areas of brightness and shade.

There is a slight tendency to overexpose bright areas, especially when shooting on sunny days. But generally, this lead sensor is quick and precise.

The other three sensors aren’t up to much, however. First up is a measly 5-megapixel ultrawide, which captures landscape shots with a completely different tone to that capable wide sensor. These ultrawide shots lack detail, even in the centre of the image.
The ultrawide
Backup for these main sensors comes by way of a 2-megapixel macro and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, neither of which is really worth spending much time on. The macro camera is too low-res to be of any use – when the whole point of such a sensor is fine detail, a lack of pixels is fatal.
The depth sensor is there to service the phone’s Portrait mode, helping to separate the subject from an artificially blurred background. It’s reasonably successful, although Portrait shots seem to lose a fair amount of the camera’s HDR composure, bleaching out skin and backgrounds alike.
Selfie portrait mode
The same is true of selfies taken with the Nokia X20’s 32-megapixel front camera. Shots that looked reasonably sharp and balanced in regular shooting suddenly become badly over- or under-exposed in selfie Portrait mode.
Regular selfie
I’m not sure how extensive the claims of ZEISS optics are, but I certainly didn’t notice any weird optical effects when shooting into the sun – something from which even many so-called flagship phones tend to suffer. Less convincing is the inclusion of a number of ZEISS Portrait effects, which swirl and distort the background in artificial ways. 
Night mode is generally a bit of a write-off. There’s lots of noise in less-than-pitch-black conditions, as well as some slightly erratic focusing. It’s borderline useless in very low-light situations, where little to no attempt is made to brighten the scene. If you get it right, with an appropriately strong light source, you can capture a pretty crisp shot like my one of a pub door. But even then, you don’t want to stare too much into the murky background.


Video recording is modest, with a hard limit of 1080p at 60fps. You also get a Cinema mode that records at a more – you’ve guessed it – cinematic 24fps, and with a wider 21:9 aspect ratio. This also encourages you to shoot in H-Log format to provide more dynamic range, and you can use some fancy ZEISS effects to add flares to your footage.
This is all well and good, but without OIS, your videos are going to look as shakily amateurish as those from any budget phone.
Performance
Snapdragon 480 isn’t quite powerful enough for the moneyThere is 5GAndroid 11 without the bloat and multiple updates
In years past, we wouldn’t have expected particularly great performance from a lower-mid-range phone. And while top-notch performance still isn’t the norm, it’s now quite attainable. The Poco F3 and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G both lay on a level of performance that wouldn’t have been out of place in a 2019 or even 2020 flagship.
Any way you cut it, the Nokia X20 doesn’t quite keep up. That’s a result of the provision of a Snapdragon 480 5G SoC, which, while being a fairly new 8nm chip, doesn’t exactly tear up trees on the performance front. An offering of 6 or 8GB of RAM is pretty much par for the course.
In putting the Nokia X20 through its paces, a Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 1655 and a single-core score of 506 places the phone well below the likes of the OnePlus Nord CE 5G (1807 and 632 respectively). That phone is the same price and offers 5G, too, yet manages to also pack in a superior Snapdragon 750G chip.

If you’re willing to drop the 5G, which really isn’t too much of a hardship at this point in time, then the Poco F3 packs a Snapdragon 870. This basically places it in darned-near-flagship territory, with scores of around 3300 on the Geekbench multi-core front.
And if you don’t want to give up on 5G? Splash just a little more cash (you don’t need to spend the full £399, if you shop around) and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G’s Snapdragon 780G will get you a multi-core score of around 2900 – another flagship-ish result.
It’s a similar story on the GPU side of things. A 3DMark Wildlife score of 978 and a Sling Shot Extreme score of 2425 position it well behind the OnePlus Nord CE 5G (1124 and 2715 respectively). Needless to say, the X20 doesn’t even approach the other two titans we’ve mentioned in terms of graphical power.
PUBG Mobile runs with HD graphics and a High frame rate by default, and it does so fluidly. Which is fine, but the Poco X3 NFC also does that for £100 less. Meanwhile, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite 5G is capable of running PUBG Mobile at HDR Graphics and Extreme frame rate settings.
In terms of general performance, the phone runs along perfectly adequately. But there’s a sense of wallowiness to the day-to-day experience that simply doesn’t match up to the price. We’d expect a £300 phone released in mid-2021 to feel snappy and responsive, and those aren’t two adjectives you could ever attribute to the Nokia X20.
On the positive side, while the X20’s interface doesn’t feel especially fluid as a result of the hardware limitations, its software is otherwise thoroughly pleasant to use. As ever with Nokia phones, this is the purest take on Android you’ll get outside of a Pixel phone.

One spec where the Nokia X20 isn’t found wanting is storage. With 128GB of internal capacity as standard, and a microSDXC slot for expansion, you’re well catered for here.
Android 11 is also here as originally intended, with no reskinning, no secondary app stores, no glitzy theme options, and practically no bloatware – unless you count Amazon and Netflix as unwelcome. It’s to Nokia’s credit that it’s stuck with this ‘Android One’ format, since it adds a sense of consistency that few cheaper phones enjoy.
This approach also means that Google’s standard apps take on all the typical smartphone duties for photo management, web browsing, messaging, emailing and the like. It’s a blessed relief, to be honest, after using multiple phones from the likes of Xiaomi, Realme and Oppo, where setting up a new device can be a chore akin to tidying a messy room or tending to an overgrown garden.
Nokia’s big promise with the Nokia X20 is that it will provide three years of security and software updates, which is a pretty big deal. Few phones go that far with their software assurances, regardless of price.
The Nokia X20 also supplies 5G connectivity for a reasonable price, but this feels like a killer feature from the previous generation. It’s now possible to snag a 5G phone for around £200, if next-gen connectivity really is your priority.
Battery life
4470mAh battery is good for two days18w wired chargingNo power brick
Nokia is making ‘two-day battery life’ claims for the X20, and in my experience that’s quite feasible. What’s interesting is that the battery, while far from small at 4470mAh, isn’t as large as you might expect.
We’ve grown accustomed to seeing 5000mAh batteries from other two-day phones. All of which makes one wonder why the Nokia X20 had to be quite so heavy, but there you are.
I found myself able to get to the end of a 15-hour day of moderate use – or four hours of screen-on time, to use a more precise metric – with just over 50% left in the tank. 
The reasons the Nokia X20 can stretch this far are pretty apparent. That 60Hz LCD screen is neither fluid enough nor vibrant enough to demand too much energy. And while the Snapdragon 480 isn’t a particularly impressive chip, it’s reasonably modern and thus efficient.
When it comes to more intensive tasks, 30 minutes of intensive 3D gaming saw the phone losing 6% of its charge. That’s in the same region as budget phones with huge 5000mAh batteries such as the Oppo A54 5G and the Realme 8. Flagship phones tend to hit double digits – although, of course, they’re running those games at much higher levels.
On the recharging front, the Nokia X20 supports up to 18W wired charging, which is fairly middle of the road. It isn’t uncommon to get 33W charging support, even at this price.
What’s more, you don’t get a wall charger in the box, so you’ll need to make that provision for yourself. It shouldn’t surprise you to learn that wireless charging isn’t part of the package either.

Should you buy it?


You demand ongoing software support: Whether it’s a point of security, or you simply want the latest version of Android on your phone, Nokia’s promise of three years of software updates is a rare and precious provision. You simply won’t find this among any of its direct rivals.


You want the best display for the money: The Nokia X20’s display is plenty big and sharp enough, but it falls short on vibrancy (LCD not OLED) and fluidity (60Hz, not 120Hz). Again, you can do much better for the money.









Final Thoughts
The Nokia X20 is another solid, reliable handset from HMD Global – but, ultimately, we have to question its value. It’s well built, offers excellent two-day battery life, a decent main camera, plus its take on Android is refreshingly free of clutter. We can also get onboard with Nokia’s above-and-beyond commitment to software updates. However, its display and processor appear to belong to a significantly lower category of phone, resulting in a day-to-day experience that’s decidedly below par.

Verdict































Unfortunately, I don’t recommend the Nokia 3.4 – for one reason. Its day-to-day performance is poor, and this rapidly becomes a headache, one that will likely make you wish you’d spent slightly more.



Pros
Android One software looks cleanDisplay has a pleasant colour toneComes with an update guarantee

Cons
Poor performanceVery limited storageMediocre camera quality 




Availability

UKRRP: £129.99





Key Features




Android One software:The Nokia 3.4 is an Android One phone. This means it uses an near untouched version of Android, and you are guaranteed two years of software updates, three years of security updates. 


Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU:This phone uses a processor from the most popular range in the world of phones, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon. This means games may be better optimised for it, although the Snapdragon 460 used here is a low-end chipset. 


Triple camera array:Three cameras mean you can shoot normal photos, ultra-wide ones and use the depth sensor to take “portrait” pics with a blurred-out background. 


Introduction
The Nokia 3.4 is a budget phone, but it’s far from the best phone around at its price.
As such, it should appeal to those who filter deals by cost, or plan to head to the high street to see what they can pick up for around £100.
As I will delve deeper into during this review, the slowness of this phone makes it very frustraiting to use.
If your budget is tight, check out our list of best cheap phones as all of these are far more pleasant to use.

Design
Plain, but tasteful, appearanceFingerprint scanner on the back
The Nokia 3.4 looks and feels pretty good considering the low price. It is, of course, an all-plastic phone aside from the glass that covers the display.
Nevertheless, I quite like that Nokia hasn’t taken the standard approach of trying to make its phones look like they’re made of aluminium and glass. The rear plastic has a lightly ridged texture that improves grip, and its appearance is plain but tasteful.
Two elements elevate the Nokia 3.4 beyond the kind of “generic” design you might expect when looking to spend as little as possible. First up, it has a punch-hole notch rather than a teardrop one – or just a chunkier upper display border. This style is usually associated with Android devices that are much more expensive than the Nokia 3.4.

The camera housing is the second feature that gives the device at least a touch of personality. Its three rear cameras sit in a ring, which is more distinctive than a straight line of lenses.
The Nokia 3.4 is neither too big, nor too heavy. In fact, its design is more-or-less exactly what it should be: inoffensive, with a hint of Nokia character.
A rear fingerprint scanner is a little slow, but it does the job. Plus, there’s just the one speaker, which is a little thin-sounding and quiet. This is another compromise you’re unlikely to have to make if you spend more.
Screen
6.39-inch 720p displayLCD techNot hugely bright screen
The Nokia 3.4 screen is a highlight. While it doesn’t offer any impressive tech, it looks pleasant thanks to a slightly warm-leaning colour tone.
This is a 6.39-inch LCD with a 720p resolution. It’s smaller than most and is as low-res as you’ll find in this category, but these aren’t significant issues in a phone this cheap.

Maximum brightness isn’t hugely impressive, and becomes more noticeable when you take the Nokia 3.4 out on a bright day. But I think display quality is one of the phone’s key strengths in terms of what you actually experience when using the device.
That said, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 is far better – and, nowadays, sells at a similar price. It offers a larger 1080p display, which is seriously impressive at this level.
Performance
Android One softwareTwo years of software updatesFeels very slow
The Nokia 3.4 is an Android One phone. This means it uses Google’s default Android interface rather than one that’s Nokia-made.
It also comes with a guarantee of two years of major software updates and three years of security updates. Frankly, this is the least anyone should expect of a new phone – but buy a unit from a price-gouging small brand and you may not receive any updates at all.
The Nokia 3.4’s interface looks great, but actually using it is another story entirely. This phone is irritatingly slow, and the situation appears to become worse with the more it’s used and filled with apps.
This seeps into everything you do with the Nokia 3.4. Switching between conversations in WhatsApp feels slow. Jumping between Chrome and Google Photos often comes with a grating delay. The processing delay of photos you take to send to a friend can seem long.

I’d much rather a phone such as the Nokia 3.4 be completely unable to play games such as PUBG and Minecraft, but let you do the basics smoothly. This phone actually performs better for games than the basics. PUBG runs just fine.
This is the opposite of what you might expect, given the Nokia 3.4 runs Android One software, perceived as having lower overheads than some third-party interfaces.
So, what’s the reason for this? The Nokia 3.4 has a Snapdragon 460 processor and 3GB of RAM. The CPU should be able to perform better than it does – it has eight cores, including four Cortex-A73s that were once considered pretty high-performance. While 3GB of RAM isn’t a huge amount, I’ve used plenty of phones that run perfectly well with that allocation.

The Nokia 3.4’s internal storage is unusually slow, however, which could act as a bottleneck, particularly given the limited RAM.
You don’t get much storage, either. There are Nokia 3.4 models with 32GB or 64GB, the latter less widely available in the UK. 
This review model is the 32GB unit, which would be the obvious choice given this is a phone for those on a tight budget. However, this amount has proved pretty insufficient. I’ve had to limit it to one storage-heavy game such as Asphalt 9 at a time, and WhatsApp’s backup library alone eats a huge chunk of the available space. And remember, you don’t actually get 32GB to use when you buy a “32GB” phone, since Android itself takes up some space.
These days, few review phones make me want to switch to another device  as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the Nokia 3.4 is one such phone.
Camera
Three cameras on the rearPrimary 13-megapixel sensorLens quality is fairly poor
The Nokia 3.4 comes with three cameras, which seems generous for a phone at this price. There’s the primary 13-megapixel camera, a basic 5-megapixel ultra-wide, and a simple 2-megapixel depth sensor.

This trio lets you have a good amount of fun with your photography. You have two useful fields of view, and the depth sensor allows for background-blurred Portrait pictures. As such, the basics that you’re likely to see with phones at up to £400 or so – where zoom cameras start to appear – are covered.
As you might have already guessed, image quality isn’t stellar. The ultra-wide camera’s low resolution means detail is limited, the image falls apart at the corners as a result of lens distortion, and the lens struggles with bright light sources. There also tends to be a granularity to relatively flat parts of images, such as the sky, even in perfect lighting. But at £100, I’m entirely happy with the quality of the ultra-wide.
It’s perfectly possible to take pictures worth sharing over WhatsApp or Instagram – and that’s all I could ask for at this price.

I have more issues with the Nokia 3.4’s 13-megapixel primary camera, in large part because you naturally expect it to be significantly better than the ultra-wide. Down at pixel level, its pictures are actually fizzier, less distinct-looking than those taken with the ultra-wide. Fine detail looks dithered, an effect that worsens at the edge of the frame.
Lens quality is quite poor; at times you can seen fairly clear HDR ghosting, where you see an afterimage. This is the result of merging frames, which phones more-or-less do as standard in most situations. The Nokia 3.4 also regularly fails to produce natural-looking skies, rendering them as a bright-to-darker blue gradient that just wasn’t there. This is likely down to the limited dynamic range of the sensor.

Slightly more expensive phones can get you close to the image quality of a high-end phone in good lighting, but the Nokia 3.4 is a way off that level. Night photography is – no surprise here – poor as well. However, the phone does have a good stab at “portrait” photography, where the background is blurred out using software. The blurring is fairly sound with simple subjects, and can make for a dramatic-looking picture.

The Nokia 3.4’s video is very basic. You can shoot at up to 1080p resolution, at a rate of 30 frames per second; 720p at 30 or 60 frames per second are options, too. But as none of them offer software stabilisation – the only reason to drop down is to save storage space, which is a legitimate concern with this particular handset.
The Nokia’s front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor and a fixed-focus lens. This means your face may appear out of focus if you take a picture reasonably close-up, so it gets close to filling the frame. Details become pretty soft in imperfect lighting, too, so results are largely on a par with what you’d expect from a true entry-level Android device.
Battery life
4000mAh batteryShould get you through the day5w charging
The Nokia 3.4 includes a 4000mAh battery, which is mid-size in 2021. It should last a full day for most people, or perhaps significantly longer for the kind of person I think should actually consider buying this Nokia handset.
I have tendde to end up with around 15% charge left by the end of a day. There isn’t enough of a buffer to allow you to charge every other day, but I haven’t needed to give it a top-up in the late afternoon just to ensure it lasts.

However, if you use your phone as much as I do then I’d strongly recommend buying something a little more expensive, or considering a brand such as Xiaomi, which offers a little more for your money. That has little to do with battery capacity, and everything to do with the Nokia 3.4’s performance issues.
The Nokia 3.4’s charger is also very poor. It’s a 5W plug, as basic as these things come. And that means you’ll want to recharge overnight, since the process can take several hours.

Should you buy it?


You value guaranteed updates: Nokia guarantees two years of major software updates and three years of security updates with this device. That’s part of the Android One promise, and is particularly reassuring at the cheaper end of the market, where you find lots of phones from small Chinese brands that may offer few, or perhaps no, updates.


You demand a good camera: The Nokia 3.4 has three rear cameras – a decent array considering its low price. However, the ultra-wide camera is quite low in resolution and the main camera exhibits some clear image quality issues that mean it belongs in the league below many of the 48-megapixel phones – some of which don’t cost much more.









Final Thoughts
The Nokia 3.4 makes a good first impression for a phone that costs less than £100 online. It comes with a decent screen; the design is less bland than some; plus the plain Android One software is better-looking than that of many phones with third-party interfaces pasted on top.But, despite using a reasonable Snapdragon 460 processor, the Nokia 3.4 feels slow. This isn’t about 3D gaming or using demanding apps. The basics such as jumping between the browser and a messenger app are affected, and many will find this frustrating.

5GThis offers 5G network support on a budget


BatteryBig cell for strong endurance


Introduction
An intriguing new mini-trend has emerged within the budget smartphone market in mid-2021. Phones like the Oppo A54 5G, the Realme 8 5G, and the Redmi Note 10 5G are all offering 5G connectivity at around the £200 mark. 
That’s cheaper than it’s ever been to get connected to broadband-like data speeds. The question I ask with each of these phones, though, is: at what cost? With a host of hardware compromises over similarly priced 4G phones, you have to really want that 5G functionality for this approach to make any sense.
Oppo, of course, has had a productive year further up the smartphone table with its Oppo Find X3 family. So can it work some of that same magic and make the Oppo A54 5G a fully rounded budget contender?
Design and Screen
Sturdy and durable all-plastic bodyDecent side-mounted fingerprint sensorReasonably colourful 6.5-inch 90Hz LCD
Oppo has gone with a pretty basic design for the Oppo A54 5G. It’s very similar to the bare bones Realme 8 5G, except for a marginally more interesting, color-shifting finish. My handset came in Fluid Black, which partially takes on the surround tone wherever it catches the light.
Together with a particularly bland camera module, however, it’s nowhere near as appealing or premium-feeling as the Redmi Note 10 5G. Its shiny plastic rear material attracts greasy prints like nobody’s business, too.

At 162.9 x 74.7 x 8.4mm, this is the very definition of a regular-sized phone. It’s pretty chunky for a budget phone at 190g, which matches the Redmi Note 10 5G and tops the 185g Realme 8 5G.
The right edge of the Oppo contains a fingerprint sensor, which is pleasingly recessed for easy access. Also helping you find the sensor is the fact that the volume keys are on the opposite edge, unlike with the Redmi Note 10 5G. The sensor itself is a reasonably speedy and agreeably reliable example of the format, and I didn’t have any real frustrations gaining access to the phone.
The bottom edge of the phone contains a 3.5mm headphone jack, which is pretty normal for a budget phone. As is the presence of a single speaker, which is somewhat tinny but gets very loud. Of course, you can get full stereo sound for the same money if you’re willing to forgo 5G.
Spoiler alert: that’s going to be a running theme throughout this review.
The Oppo A54 5G offers a very similar display to the Realme 8 5G. Indeed, given that Oppo and Realme are owned by the same parent company, I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s exactly the same component.
As such, you’re getting a 6.5-inch 2400 x 1080 IPS LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate. This is the first point of compromise, as you can typically either get a more vibrant OLED panel (the Realme 8) or a more fluid 120Hz LCD (the Poco X3 NFC) at the same price if you’re willing to forego 5G.

With a typical brightness of 480 nits (the same as the Realme 8 5G), the Oppo A54 5G’s screen gets a little brighter than the gloomy Redmi Note 10 5G, though Oppo’s auto brightness system continues to be a little too aggressive for my taste. Still, its colours are a lot more vibrant than the Redmi’s, and seem less prone to washing out further when you tilt it off-axis.
Camera
48MP main sensor good in bright conditions, but bad in low-light8MP ultra-wide lifts it above the competition16MP selfie cam OK, but smudges skin tones
The Oppo A54 5G features a 48MP wide camera sensor, which is the same spec as its two budget 5G rivals. However, it has a marginally wider f/1.7 aperture.
Sure enough, in daylight conditions, the Oppo A54 5G captures very bright and reasonably detailed shots, with a tad less oversharpening than the Redmi Note 10 5G. On one particularly sunny day, the Oppo dealt with the extreme brightness of the sun when shooting some cows in a field better than its Xiaomi-bred rival – albeit with the odd dose of overexposure.

You also get something that neither the Redmi Note 10 5G nor the Realme 8 5G provide – an ultra-wide sensor. It’s no great shakes of course, at a mere 8MP and f/2.2. There’s a marked drop-off in detail and dynamic range compared to the main sensor, but it’s far from a total write-off, and I’m glad Oppo included it.

Unsurprisingly, there’s no dedicated telephoto. Oppo does achieve usable 2x results by cropping in on that high-pixel-count sensor, but I wouldn’t advise pushing further to 5x. The results aren’t pretty.
A photo at 2x zoom
Both the Redmi Note 10 5G and the Realme 8 5G took better shots in lesser lighting than the Oppo A54 5G, both with and without the use of Night mode. In low ambient lighting conditions the Oppo captured less detail and didn’t always seem to focus so well on subjects, while in darker night time conditions the Oppo A54 5G tended to produce a bagful of grain.


Macro shots turned out marginally better than on the Redmi Note 10 5G, but they still looked awful. With a mere 2MP sensor, it simply lacks the fine detail needed for shots that demand, well, fine detail.
Oppo’s Portrait mode algorithm is reasonably adept at isolating the subject, and I only lost the very edges of my hat to the artificially imposed bokeh. But the blurry background looks a little fake.

On the video front, you only get support for 1080p at 30fps. This is the same as the Oppo’s budget 5G rivals, but that doesn’t make it any more impressive. Not when you can easily get a similarly priced 4G phone (take your pick) that’s capable of 4K or 1080p/120fps.
The Oppo A54 5G’s 16MP selfie cam is a match for the Realme 8 5G’s, and packs in more pixels than the 8MP Redmi Note 10 5G equivalent. But it still smudges skin tones and struggles with bright areas.

Performance
Snapdragon 480 5G roughly as capable as rivals4GB RAM and 64GB storage seems stingyColorOS 11.1 clean, simple, and relatively bloat-free
The Oppo A54 5G is powered by a Snapdragon 480 5G SoC. This is a considerably more mainstream choice than the MediaTek Dimensity 700 5G chip adopted by the Realme 8 5G and the Redmi Note 10 5G, but also a marginally slower one in certain ways.
While the Realme 8 5G scored 1749 and the Redmi Note 10 5G scored 1677 in my Geekbench 5 multicore tests, the Oppo A54 5G could only manage 1578. That’s a CPU-focused test. 
The Oppo A54 5G attains something like parity when it comes to the GPU tests, which is an area where the Dimensity 700 chip isn’t quite so commanding. In 3DMark’s snappy one-minute Wildlife and Wildlife Extreme tests, the Oppo fell around 10 to 15% behind the Realme 8 5G. But in the more prolonged Wildlife Extreme test, it scored 2417 to the Realme’s 2308.
In other words, the Oppo A54 5G is likely to perform a little better than its budget rivals when playing high-end 3D games for extended periods. Think PUBG Mobile and Genshin Impact.

In practical terms, booting up PUBG Mobile yielded mid-level presets of HD graphics and High Frame Rate, just like those aforementioned rivals. Jumping into a game, it hit the same kind of 30fps frame rate in the lobby, with the odd dip down to 28 or 29.
The Oppo A54 5G’s processor is backed by 4GB of RAM, which isn’t much even for a budget phone. While it matches the Redmi Note 10 5G, the Realme 8 5G offers either 6GB or 8GB, as does the non-5G Poco X3 NFC.
One other specification that feels like a bit of a compromise here is the amount of storage that’s available. 64GB might seem ample if you haven’t checked into this end of the market recently, but the truth is 128GB has quickly become the new normal. Even for the price, the Oppo A54 5G’s allotment feels a little stingy.
General navigation is reasonably smooth regardless. As with the Oppo A54 5G’s rivals, apps can take a little long to boot up, though of course that’s only really noticeable if you’re coming from a more capable phone.
In software terms, the Oppo A54 5G runs on ColorOS 11.1 layered over Android 11. That’s the same basic set-up as you’ll find in the premium Oppo Find X3 family.
While I still wouldn’t call ColorOS my favourite Android skin, it’s undeniably clean and functional. There’s no app tray by default, which keeps things simple and rather iOS-like in its total focus on the home screen.
It’s a shame to see Google Feed jettisoned from its position to the left of the home screen, though. Still, there’s no dodgy widget screen in its place as with certain rival UIs, so I can appreciate the attempt at restraint at least.
Bloatware is fairly minimal too, with just a regular roster of basic tools and apps (Music, File Manager, Weather etc.) to contend with. Facebook is the only third party app to come preinstalled on the phone.
Battery Life
Big 5000mAh batteryCan manage two days of light to moderate use10W charger one of the least impressive in its class
The Oppo A54 5G runs off a 5000 mAh battery, which can be considered large when taking in the smartphone field as a whole. It’s exactly the same size as its budget 5G rivals listed above, however.
There’s a very good reason for this shared spec. Many an early 5G phone has run afoul of 5G’s thirsty nature, powering down well before the day is done. Until 5G modems get more efficient, brute force seems to be the safest bet in securing better stamina.

You can say more or less the exact same thing about the Oppo A54 5G’s battery as you can the Redmi Note 10 5G’s and the Realme 8 5G’s. It’ll clear a full day of usage with ease, even with an excess of screen-on time, and will likely stretch through a second day under moderate conditions.
On a particularly light 15 hour day with just 2 hours 20 minutes of screen on time, we were left with more than 70% left in the tank. Days with more regular usage would drain closer to 50%. This is all comparable with its rivals, but it remains impressive within a wider smartphone context.
When it comes to media consumption, the Oppo A54 5G lost about 9% of its juice after an hour of Netflix streaming and 2% after an hour of YouTube Music streaming, which is a single percentage point worse than the Realme 8 5G in both cases. Allowing a certain margin for error, we can probably call that a draw. 
30 minutes of PUBG, meanwhile, sapped just 6% of a charge. That’s about half what a mid-range or flagship phone would consume, though of course such phones will be running 
high-end games with much more demanding graphical settings, frame rates, and resolutions.
The phone falls behind its direct rivals on the charging front, however. Whereas both the Realme 8 5G and the Redmi Note 10 5G pack 18W chargers (itself a step back from similarly priced 4G phones), the Oppo A54 5G only includes a mere 10W charger.
This means that charging from 0 to 50% takes just over an hour. That’s really not very fast at all.

5G at a sub-£200 price tag means everything to you This is another affordable phone with 5G support, so if this is a key feature for you then this remains a decent choice


You value performance above all else This is far from a speedy phone and not a good choice if you’re a big mobile gamer









Final Thoughts
The Oppo A54 5G gives you 5G connectivity and exemplary stamina for less than £200. If those are your main criteria for a new smartphone, this is a solid option that sits right alongside the Realme 8 5G and the Redmi Note 10 5G. But there are fundamental compromises to the display, camera, performance, and basic specification that you simply don’t have to make to the same degree with the 4G alternatives.

Not bothered about that extra layer of tech skimmed off to accomodate 5G? You’ll probably like the Motorola Moto G50 a lot. It performs reasonably well day-to-day and the battery life is excellent. Like the best Moto G phones it nails the basics and comes with no day-ruining problems.

5GYou’ll get 5G on the cheap


AndroidThe software here is clean and simple


Introduction
The Motorola Moto G50 is an affordable 5G phone. While there are a lot of these about in 2021, the category is still fairly new.
5G mobile internet is much cheaper to implement than it once was, but the Moto G50 still has a few compromises I wouldn’t usually expect to see at the price.
These are a 720p screen, which looks good but doesn’t have the sort of near-flagship sharpness you can easily find among the best cheap phones. And although the Motorola Moto G50 has three cameras on its back, it feels like a single-camera phone much of the time as there’s no ultra-wide lens. These are found in almost every other phone in this category.

It’s here to offer 5G, seen as one of the most important new features to have for today’s phone buyer, to people who wouldn’t have been able to afford it in previous generations.
Design and Screen
Plastic build, to be expected at the priceOnly a single speaker
There are now quite a lot of 5G phones at the budget end of the market. They all look and feel fairly similar.
Characteristics they share include an all-plastic build made to look like a phone with aluminium sides and a glass back. I like a glass-backed phone, but stick the bundled silicone case on the Moto G50 and whether it’s made of glass and metal or plastic makes very little difference.
The Motorola Moto G50 has a slightly more subdued look than its rivals from Xiaomi and Realme. There are no massive slogans or logos stamped on the back, and while the rear finish sparks laser-like lines of blue when it catches the light, it’s otherwise a fairly consistent grey/dark blue colour
A green Moto G50 is also available.

A few specifics are worth noting. The Motorola Moto G50 has a rear finger fingerprint scanner, rather than one mounted on the side. It works well, is fast enough and reliable.
Where a fingerprint reader sits is largely a case of personal preference these days. Even “high end” in-screen ones offer no huge functional benefit over a good, cheaper rear-mounted one like the Moto G50’s. Personally, I’d prefer a side-loaded reader to this one, but that’s probably because I’ve used more of them over the last year.
The Motorola Moto G50 is also slightly smaller than alterntives like the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite, as it has a mid-size 6.5-inch screen. This was a sensible design decision as the G50 is a truly mainstream phone, perfect for the sort of person who prefers something easier to handle over a slightly better video streaming experience.
It’s a phone to use and abuse, not to treat as the light of your tech life. Like some other budget Motos, the Moto G50 has a water resistant barrier that provides some protection from rain without offering full-on IP-grade resistance. Put the case on and you really can treat it fairly carelessly.

I’m a little disappointed by the lack of factory-applied screen protector, though, and have already managed to put a little nick in the display glass despite treating it fairly well. Consider buying a screen protector.
The Motorola Moto G50 also has just one speaker, down on the bottom edge of the phone. It’s moderately loud and not too thin-sounding, but a stereo array is always preferable.
The Motorola Moto G50 has a 6.5-inch LCD screen that has two hallmarks of the tight budget with which is was designed. It’s a 720p screen, not the 1080p kind you get with the Moto G G5, and it has a teardrop notch rather than the punch hole style considered more “current”, “stylish” or “expensive” by some.
I find it hard to care too much about this when the iPhone 12 Pro Max costs more than four times as much and still has a huge notch. But bear it in mind if you prefer the punch hole style, seen in the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite and Oppo A54 5G.

The resolution is perhaps a more substantive issue. 720p phones like the Moto G50 can and do still look pretty sharp, but on switching from the Oppo A54 5G, there was a clear step down. I went from a screen that looks – in many situations – almost indistinguishable from that of a far pricier phone to one more clearly lower-end.
Text appears slightly softer, although two weeks in I can’t say I’m left wishing I could stop using the Moto G50 and go back to a 1080p best phone.
The Moto G50 does not have ultra-deep colour, but looks perfectly good to my eyes. And, the clincher, its outdoors visibility is solid enough thanks to respectable maximum brightness.
This is also a 90Hz screen, best demonstrated by scrolling down your app drawer. It simply looks smoother than it does on a standard 60Hz screen – although an above-60Hz refresh rate is no longer particularly notable even at £200.

Performance
Not the best performer in its price class, but gets by just fineNo grating lag, just the slight performance drop of an entry-level CPU
The Motorola Moto G50 uses the Snapdragon 480 CPU, which sees 5G drop down to the lower tiers of Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. It’s not as good as the Snapdragon 765G used in the earliest “affordable” 5G phones, but is actually rather nippy and zaps the very obvious performance issues of the Moto G10 and the more subtle ones of the Moto G30.
Occasionally, apps and interface screens may take a brief beat to populate. Games won’t load as fast as they do on the surprisingly super-powered Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro, but I could happily carry on using the Moto G50 as my main phone for the rest of the year.
In classic Moto G series style, the Moto G50 does many of the core things well enough to keep you satisfied.

The gnawing issue is some of its competitors are superior. Xiaomi’s Mi 10T Lite uses the somewhat more powerful Snapdragon 750G, the Realme 7 5G the punchy Dimensity 800U. And if you don’t really care about 5G, the Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro is ridiculously powerful at a little over £200. It’s a much better gaming phone than the Moto G50.
I tried a bunch of games on the Moto G50, and I think most will be perfectly happy with what you get here. It’s only very demanding games like Fortnite that show it up. You’ll have to run it at reduced graphics settings, and even then dips below 30fps are fairly common.
You get 64GB storage, the standard amount at this price. It’s enough to get buy for many, but you can also pop in a microSD card.
Camera
Lack of ultra-wide camera is disappointingFairly poor texture rendering from main camera
I find it very easy to ignore the minor Moto G50 issues I’ve mentioned so far. I mostly only play Fortnite to see how it runs on phones, and while I can see the difference between 720p and 1080p screen, living at a lower resolution has been no chore.
The Moto G50 camera is different, though. This phone has a triple camera array, but it feels like a single camera one because there is no zoom or ultra-wide lens.

Aside from the primary 48-megapixel sensor we get the usual crummy 2-megapixel depth sensor – useful in that it lets you shoot Portrait background-blurred images of any subject, but poor in terms of the quality of hardware it uses. The third camera is a 5-megapixel macro. You use this for ultra-close photography.
While it is far better than the 2-megapixel macro cameras used in a lot of entry-level Androids, it is nowhere near as useful as an ultra-wide. The best secondary phone cameras give you multiple compositional options when something you see makes you think “ooh, that would make a nice photo”. But macro photography is an altogether different animal. The close-up photos the Moto G50 takes are nothing to get excited about either – the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro is in a totally different league for macro images.

The Moto G50’s primary camera is also below average. I had a chance to compare directly it with a stack of comparable phones: the Moto G 5G Plus, Xiaomi Mi 10T lite, Xiaomi Poco X3 NFC and Realme 8 Pro. The Moto G50 was the worst of the lot, producing fizzier fine detail, the weakest texture handling and the poorest image integrity at the edges of the frame.
None of the Moto G50 cameras are great, and night-time photography is poor even with the help of the brightness-boosting Night Vision mode. Images are very soft.

Now, having roundly talked the Moto G50 camera down, I don’t think it’s a disaster zone. Not at all. It still uses Motorola’s very solid dynamic range boosting techniques to get you even-looking images in all sort of challenging lighting. And while the lens can struggle a little with intense light sources (ie the sun), introducing purple colour noise at times, this usually isn’t too glaring if you keep your lens clean.
The part I’ve enjoyed most is that the Moto G50 doesn’t take an age to process its photos, unlike the Moto G30 and Moto G10. This can be a real headache in cheaper phones, particularly if you shoot an image to share in WhatsApp. The improvement is likely down to the Snapdragon 480’s superior image signal processor.



The Moto G50’s video is limited. You can only shoot at 1080p. There are 30fps and 60fps modes but I’d advise sticking to 30fps as the higher frame rate disables stabilisation, which is a must for any handheld footage if you don’t want it to look like steaming garbage.
There’s a 13-megapixel selfie camera around the front. It can take very detailed shots in perfect lighting, picking out every single facial hair, but the results unsurprisingly decline dramatically in poor lighting as there’s no pixel binning here to compensate for limited light.
Battery life
Long battery life, beating many rivals including some other MotosSlightly slow charging
There are two good reasons to buy the Moto G50. The first is to get 5G on the cheap. The second is its excellent battery life.
It has, like almost every phone in this class, a 5000mAh battery. But judging by my experience it even outlasts top performers like the Oppo A54 5G, perhaps because it has a 720P screen rather than a 1080p one.
I routinely have around 40% or more charge by bed time, and would trust it to last a full day, on any day.
Battery charging speed is less impressive, however. The Moto G50 comes with a 10W charger, not a truly fast one. I don’t find this a huge turn-off as the phone doesn’t need mid-day top-ups. But the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite has a 33W charger, showing this Moto up.

Should you buy it?


You want cheap 5G: The Moto G50 offers 5G for under £200. That is its number one job. It’s less than you’ll pay for the direct rival from Samsung.


You want a good camera: Don’t be fooled by the three cameras on the back. You only get one field of view useful for everyday photography – no ultra-wide – and the main camera is worse than much of the competition.









Final Thoughts
Motorola has taken the same feature-cutting approach as Samsung here, but the Moto G50 is probably a better buy than the rival Samsung Galaxy A32 5G as it costs £50 less.However, it’s hard to ignore alternatives like the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite, which is available at the same price at the time of writing and has none of these obvious compromises. It’s also a clear step down from the last-generation Moto G 5G Plus, which was (/is) not much more expensive.

Verdict


































If you’re looking for a phone with a top-of-the-line Snapdragon processor, a long-lasting battery and a smooth 120Hz display, the Realme GT is definitely worth your consideration. The camera has its drawbacks and the faux leather design might not appeal to everyone, but with features such as 5G and fast charging, the phone is well-equipped to compete with larger flagships at an alluring mid-range price.

CameraSony 64-megapixel triple camera


Battery4500mAh with 65W SuperDart charging 


Introduction 
Realme recently unveiled its latest eye-catching flagship, the Realme GT. 
The phone packs a 120Hz Super AMOLED display, a 64-megapixel triple-camera array, a 4500mAh battery and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 5G chip all for less that €450 (or under €600, if you opt for the 12GB/256GB model).  To non-techies these are all features and specs we traditionally see on much more expensive phones.
The smartphone will be available to buy in the UK from June 21 – but should you take the plunge? Read on to learn more about Realme’s latest flagship handset and how I found using it for the last week as my main phone.

Design and screen 
The GT has an eye-catching vegan leather dual-tone design There’s a headphone jack The display boasts a 120Hz refresh rate and a 360Hz touch sampling rate 
One of the most attention-grabbing aspects of the GT is its vegan leather dual-tone design. The review unit on test is covered in a textured, warm yellow faux leather and features a wide, black stripe that extends vertically from the camera module. The phone comes in three colours – Racing Yellow, Dashing Silver and Dashing Blue – and is treated to protect against odours, cracks and fingerprints. While the black stripe on the Racing Yellow GT can be prone to fingerprints, I can’t see the vegan leather becoming scuffed as easily. 

The Realme GT is a slim and lightweight phone at 158.5 x 173.3 x 9.1mm and it weighs 186g. The edges of the phone are a shiny dark silver metal and slightly wider at the top and bottom of the handset. On the right sits the power button, while the volume controls and SIM card slot are on the left. There’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack on the base of the phone, alongside a USB-C port for charging. 
Turn the GT over and you’ll be faced with a 6.43-inch Super AMOLED display. The panel is surrounded by a thin black bezel, with no notch taking up space at the top of the screen. Instead, the front camera resides in a hole-punch design in the top-left corner. 
The display boasts a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, as well as a 360Hz touch sampling rate, offering smoother scrolling and a faster response time. The screen also packs dual ambient light sensors to automatically adjust the brightness and keep it comfortable to the eyes. 

During testing I found the display is noticeably smooth and the colours presented on-screen are bright and vibrant. The Realme GT also includes a face unlock feature, as well as an in-display fingerprint scanner that makes unlocking the phone feel quick and seamless. I never had any issues using it to unlock the phone during testing.
Camera 
The GT has a 64-megapixel triple camera Zoom and macro settings leave something to be desired The Pro Nightscape mode does a good job of brightening up scenes 
The Realme GT features a triple-camera array, consisting of a 64-megapixel Sony IMX682 main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro sensor. Realme claims its upgraded multi-frame synthesis algorithm offers clarity closer to 108 megapixels by capturing several 64-megapixel images at once. 
Comparing images captured in the camera’s default setting with its 64-megapixel mode, the primary difference is how much detail is visible up-close. The larger file size of the latter allows you to zoom in much further and glean more detail from the 64-megapixel image. The threads in my daisy face mask, for example, were much sharper and easier to recognise up-close in the 64-megapixel mode than they were in the standard camera setting when I pinched to zoom in. 
The Realme GT’s default camera setting

The colours were also brighter in the 64-megapixel setting in certain images, although I didn’t necessarily prefer the look to the regular camera since the brightness took away some of the dimension.

However, the differences between the two are miniscule if you aren’t looking for them. Both settings present deep, vibrant colours and crisp detail. My biggest issue with the Realme’s camera is that it doesn’t offer the most natural result, especially when compared to some of the best camera phones we’ve recently tested. The little details in the trees look overly sharp and the colours of the grass and the flowers are pumped beyond what you’d see in real life. 

The macro lens doesn’t feel necessary. While it’s able to focus closer to a subject, the result is much duller and grittier than that captured with the wide angle camera. 

There’s a 10x zoom camera that produces decent results at 2x, but the image starts to become a little crunchy when pushed to 5x and beyond. There’s also an ultra-wide angle lens that makes it possible to fit more of your surroundings into one image. 
2x zoom
5x zoom
10x zoom
One upgrade Realme credits to its new algorithm is better noise control and richer details in low-light scenes. The Realme GT has a Night mode and a Pro Nightscape mode. While the Night mode noticeably reduces the level of noise in an image and brightens up the scene overall, Pro Nightscape takes this a step further by offering manual controls such as ISO and shutter speed that allow you to control how much light the camera lets in. The resulting images are even brighter and smoother than those captured with the standard Night mode.

Pro Nightscape mode
On the front of the phone you’ll find a 16-megapixel hole-punch camera with AI beauty mode sliders and a Portrait mode. The front camera creates bright, clear selfies with soft backgrounds (and the addition of AI smoothing doesn’t hurt). 
The front camera in portrait mode
Turn the phone around and the rear camera offers a handful of portrait modes, including AI colour portrait and dynamic bokeh. AI colour portrait juxtaposes a coloured portrait with a black-and-white background, while dynamic bokeh offers an interesting horizontal bokeh effect akin to a moving train behind you. 
The Realme GT is also able to capture 4K video at up to 60fps. Videos taken with the GT are bright and sharp and the audio is clear, too. 
Performance 
The GT is powered by the flagship Snapdragon 888 5G Realme UI 2.0 offers some fun personalisation features The phone is equipped with a steel-copper cooling system 
One of the features that makes the Realme GT a flagship device is the top-of-the-line chipset that powers it. The GT packs Qualcomm’s current flagship SoC, the Snapdragon 888 5G, along with up to 12GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage. I tested the 8GB/128GB version. 
The list of phones powered by the chipset include the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, the OnePlus 9 Pro and the Xiaomi Mi 11, so you know the Realme GT is in good company. Not only does the chip offer 5G support at an affordable price, but it also packs some serious performance power. 

The phone is fast and responsive, moving between apps with very little delay. This seamless feeling is helped along by the 120Hz refresh rate and 360Hz touch sampling rate of the display. The latter is especially helpful when gaming on the GT. Jumping into a game of Among Us showcases just how responsive the display is, allowing you to move through tasks and flee from imposters with ease. 
Onto the operating system, the GT runs Realme UI 2.0, which is based on Android 11. The skin includes some fun personalisation features, including the ability to set a colour scheme for your phone to follow, lots of always-on display themes to choose from, and customisable fonts and icons, to name a few. I really enjoyed taking the time to personalise the phone with my favourite colours and a font that places tiny bears above all of my app tiles. In general, I found the OS relatively intuitive and easy-to-navigate. 
One of the GT’s always on display themes
The GT also features a next-gen steel-copper composite structure that Realme claims offers 50% better cooling power and 42% more strength when compared with traditional copper VC cooling systems. While the phone did become quite hot while charging, I found it otherwise remained pleasantly cool even with heavy use. 
Battery life 
The GT features a 4500mAh battery The phone also supports 65W SuperDart fast charging There’s a power-saving mode and support for OTG reverse charging 
The Realme GT packs a huge 4500mAh battery that can last an average day of use with ease. I kept an eye on the battery level while streaming YouTube videos and noted that it took 52 minutes for the battery to drop by just 5%. 
The GT supports Realme’s 65W SuperDart charging technology, which means the USB-C charger in the box is capable of taking you from 0% to 100% in as little as 35 minutes. 

You can also save battery in a pinch by entering power-saving mode. This prompts the phone to close some background apps, pause background automatic synchronisation function, reduce the display’s brightness, and turn off touch vibrations. 
Finally, there’s support for OTG reverse charge, which allows you to juice up select phones, true wireless headphones and smart watches with your GT.

Verdict
































The OnePlus Nord CE 5G is not a ‘classic’ OnePlus phone, one that disrupts things by offering more than you usually get for the money. 
You’d buy one because you would prefer a relatively small, light and classy-looking phone rather than the geek-friendly, high-value giants on offer from companies like Xiaomi. 
I prefer the original OnePlus Nord, available for only slightly more at the time of review. But the OnePlus Nord CE 5G has its charms.

Key Features




OLEDThe display here is strong for the price


Snapdragon 750GStrong performance and 5G support


Headphone portThe 3.5mm port makes a welcome return


Introduction
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G is a cheaper version of the original OnePlus Nord, with no major benefits aside from a slightly lower price. And I do mean slightly, because at the time of writing you can get the entry-level Nord for only £329.
Cuts include a plastic back instead of a glass one, a lower-end processor, slightly worse cameras and a screen that cannot get quite as bright.
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s snips are consistent across the board, and no single one is too dramatic unless you have your heart set on an Android that feels expensive. Add them up, though, and this phone doesn’t seem as solid a buy as the original Nord or some of the best cheap phones you can get for less money.
Competition in this area of phones is fierce. However, if you like OnePlus’s style and want an OLED screen, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G is a perfectly sound option.
Price and Availability
There are two main versions of the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. The cheaper one costs £299 and has 128GB storage, 8GB RAM.
Spend £369 and you get 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, much like some of the most expensive phones around. However, 12GB RAM is arguably overkill for a phone with this processor, so buy the pricier version for its greater storage rather than the additional RAM. There’s no microSD card slot here to let you expand the storage further down the line.
Blue and black colours are on offer with either spec, and the higher-end OnePlus Nord CE 5G comes in an additional “Silver Ray” finish.

OnePlus 9R vs OnePlus 9: How do they compare?

Design
Plastic sides, plastic back construction is a step down from the OnePlus NordHas an in-screen fingerprint scanner, unlike most affordable 5G phones
I have liked OnePlus’s approach to phone design for ages. I’m not talking about the tech it uses inside, but the way the company tends to stop a few steps short of the bombastic looks other Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Realme go for.
“Reserved” is the word that usually comes to mind, and this mostly applies to the OnePlus Nord CE 5G too. The back has a matt blue finish, in a very similar shade to that of the original OnePlus Nord.
The OnePlus CE 5G has a pleasant blue back. Black and silver are also options
OnePlus’s logo is small, and doesn’t even say “OnePlus”. OnePlus’s phones often look that bit more grown-up than some of the competition, which can be refreshing. It’s like drinking a glass of water after a trip through an American city spent drinking gallons of luminous diet soda.
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G isn’t as well-made as the original Nord, though. Its back looks a bit like matt finish glass but is actually plastic. And the purple gradient finish that appears at the very end of the curved sides does take away slightly from the tasteful conservatism I mentioned earlier.
The original OnePlus Nord feels more “high-end” than this CE model, to a greater extent than their £30 price difference suggests. Its build is pretty similar to many phones in the £200-250 range.
There is one extra feature, though. The OnePlus Nord CE 5G has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, where most other affordable 5G phones have one either on the side or the back. This one is not as fast as the OnePlus 9’s. But it is, in my experience, a lot better than the Realme 8 Pro’s.
Smaller than some, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G is pretty easy to handle
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s speaker is loud too, although it uses just one driver on the phone’s bottom, and it doesn’t have the impressive lower-frequency output you can get from much more expensive phones. This leaves it sounding a little hard on the ear at higher volumes. Those extra few decibels are still useful for listening while you’re in the shower, cooking or as the kettle boils, though.
You also get a headphone jack, which might be the only advantage the OnePlus Nord CE 5G has over the original OnePlus Nord.
Screen
Display size doesn’t sacrifice handling for extra screen inchesClaimed 1000-nit brightness doesn’t pan out in realityOLED tech is better than the LCDs used in many cheaper alternatives
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G has a 6.43-inch AMOLED screen of 1080p resolution. Its size is a good fit if you’d pick a phone that is easy to handle over one with a monster Netflix and gaming screen. If that’s your bag, consider something like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro, although it does not have 5G.
OnePlus says the Nord offers peak brightness of 1000 nits, but this must be in very limited conditions, perhaps with only a small square of the screen lit. I took the phone outside on a very sunny day with both the Oppo A74 5G and the original Nord. Both phones were a good bit clearer than the OnePlus Nord CE 5G.
Its outdoors clarity is fine, but nothing more than is now common among £200-300 phones.
The 90Hz OLED screen looks good, but outdoor brightness is not best-in-class
OLED depth and contrast is what you pay extra for. The OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s screen has per-pixel lighting, which means black parts of the screen will stay black even in very dark rooms. It doesn’t make a huge difference in normally-lit ones, though.
OLED’s colour is more obvious in these situations. The OnePlus Nord CE 5G has a true wide colour gamut screen, meaning it can display deeper tones than some LCD rivals at £200-300.
It can also make a high refresh rate look better, thanks to OLED’s fast-reacting pixels. You can get phones at this price with either 90Hz or 120Hz screens, whose screens refresh their image 90 or 120 times a second rather than the usual 60. The OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s refresh rate is 90Hz, which makes web pages and the app screen scroll more smoothly than your current phone, assuming you don’t already own one with a high refresh rate.
Performance
Good general performance a solid GPU performanceYou can get better gaming phones for your money
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s software looks just like that of the other OnePlus phones. It uses the company’s OxygenOS software on top of Android 11.
This phone feels zippy, even if it is a lower-end model. It has a Snapdragon 750G, which has similar CPU performance to the Snapdragon 765G of the OnePlus Nord.
I’ve noticed the OnePlus Nord CE 5G tends to keep apps you’ve used recently ‘parked’, not fully closed down, significantly longer than a lot of the other affordable 5G phones I’ve tried in the last few months. It does seem to make good use of its 8/12GB RAM, and this improves the experience of jumping between apps.
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s ColorOS interface is good
There’s minimal lag and loading games is reasonably quick, if not at the level of the OnePlus 9 of course.
Games won’t run quite as well as they do on the original OnePlus Nord, though. 3D Mark’s benchmark tools suggest the Nord has roughly an extra 50% GPU power and, sure enough, their graphics chipsets are different. The OnePlus Nord CE 5G has an Adreno 619, the old Nord an Adreno 620.
This difference is frankly not going to be all that obvious in most games. Casual titles don’t need a top-end processor. But Fortnite does run better on the Nord than the OnePlus Nord CE 5G, and the disparity is even wider if you compare it to the cheaper Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro, one of the few affordable Androids that can legitimately claim to be “made for gaming”.
Camera
Higher megapixel count does not result in better image qualityMonochrome camera is uselessCompetes OK with most £200-300, but not an imaging superstar
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G has three rear cameras, and two of them are useful. Its third is a monochrome camera, in contention for the most useless camera put into a phone in 2021, particularly as few people will even dig out the particular “P3” monochrome filter that uses it.
Our other two are a 64-megapixel standard camera and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide. This may sound higher-end than the OnePlus Nord’s 48-and-8-megapixel combo, but it isn’t.
The CE’s cameras are step down from the Nord in a few respects
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s main camera uses an Omnivision sensor rather than a Sony one, seen in the Nord, and it does not seem quite as good. It tends to smush up textures and fine detail in the shadow areas more often than the best in this class.
Zoom detail is slightly worse than the non-CE Nord’s too, despite the higher-res sensor. The OnePlus Nord CE 5G and original Nord do not have an actual zoom camera, but do have a software 2x zoom mode.
It’s not all about OnePlus, of course, so I also compared the phone to the Realme 8 Pro and the Xiaomi X3 NFC, which has one of the best camera arrays you can get for under £200. The Xiaomi once again is better at retaining fine texture detail in the darkest areas of the picture. Its ultra-wide also trashes the OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s, because it has a better 13-megapixel sensor.
This is what the OnePlus Nord CE 5G camera app looks like
The Realme 8 Pro is also better for night photography. However, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G is actually similar to the original Nord at night, and has a dedicated Nightscape mode. Its low-light images are significantly better than those of the Oppo A54 5G and A74 5G. 
If you’re hoping this phone will outright beat the others you might buy at £200-250, it doesn’t. But most of the best performers in that price range do not have 5G.
Photos taken in good lighting are generally solid, with lively colour and enough detail
The ultra-wide oversaturated colour to a greater extent than the main camera
There’s no macro camrea but the primary lets you get moderately close
Here’s a demo of the OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s background blur mode
The phone’s exposure metering is generally good
The sky was, of course, not as purple as seen by the Onelus Nord CE 5G camera 
I’m mostly pleased with the OnePlus Nord CE 5G’s video. You can shoot at up to 4K resolution at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps. All these top modes have decent software stabilisation, which is reassuring.
The 16-megapixel Sony selfie camera is solid, able to hold onto plenty of detail in lower light, although it does tend to lean on contrast a bit to keep your pictures looking punchy. This is not always the most flattering approach, bringing out wrinkles and specular highlights on your forehead in some situations.
In short, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G camera is fine, but nothing special, and is beaten by the older Nord and bunch of cheaper non-5G phones.
Battery life
One day battery life maxHeavy users may need an evening top-upGreat charging speed for this class
The OnePlus approach to battery life is a bit different to that of other affordable 5G and 4G phones you might buy with £300 to spend. It has a 4500mAh battery, smaller than the 5000mAh that has become the standard in this class.
With my every day use the OnePlus Nord CE 5G tends to go the distance, but without much charge to spare by the time each day ends. This is quite unlike the Motorola Moto G50, a less capable phone in other respects, which always seems to be left with a good amount of charge when I came to plug it in.

Stamina here is pretty similar to OnePlus’s other phones. It’s fine, but little more than that. You can drain them down in a day if you hit them hard. Counter-intuitively I find this a little more of an issue with the OnePlus Nord CE 5G than the OnePlus 9 series as there are a lot of affordable Androids competing for your cash that last longer than the flagships. 
High-end phones trade on advanced features like amazing cameras, slick design and great gaming performance, while cheaper ones often focus more on something many of us care about just as much: battery life that makes them easy to get on with.
OnePlus’s consolation prize is fast charging. The OnePlus Nord CE 5G doesn’t not have the company’s quickest charging standard, Warp Charge 65T (65W), but it does have Warp Charge 30T (30W). This takes the phone from dead flat to 61% in 30 minutes, and to a full battery in 69 minutes.
The claims from OnePlus HQ are even better than this, 70% in 30 mins. However, this is likely because their testing leaves out the part right at the start of charging from a dead flat battery, where charger the output is deliberately kept low to avoid damaging the battery itself. Either way, a 10 minute top-up goes a long way.
It’s much faster charging than the 18W Pixel 4a, for example, although Xiaomi offers 33W charging in phones at the same price and cheaper.

Should you buy it?


You want a relatively petite, good-looking phoneOnePlus may have sacrificed a glass back to make the Nord CE 5G cheaper to produce, but it is still a better-looking phone than many you might choose with a £300 budget to spend. It’s not too big, the frosted plastic back looks great and the 6.43 inch screen size makes the phone smaller and easier to handle than the Xiaomi alternatives that might suit an enthusiast crowd better.


You own an older OnePlus or NordThe OnePlus Nord CE 5G bridges the gap between OnePlus’s cheap N-series phones and the Nord. That means you have to have to head a way back into OnePlus’s past to find a main-line phone from which it would be a suitable upgrade. Perhaps 2017’s OnePlus 5.









Verdict
The OnePlus Nord CE 5G is not OnePlus’s best phone for value. And the cuts made to lower the price from the first Nord are quite wide-ranging. Still, it’s not a bad buy if you want a 5G phone that doesn’t cost a packet, and don’t like the look of the competition, may of which are a bit larger and heavier.

Verdict































The Realme 8 offers a competent smartphone package for anyone looking to spend less than £200. In skipping 5G, you get a vibrant FHD+ AMOLED display, a reasonably capable 64-megapixel camera, plus superior gaming performance over the Realme 8 5G. However, there are a few quirks and glitches here that may need addressing, while those hoping for genuine progress over the (at the time) impressive Realme 7 will be disappointed.

Introduction
In the Realme 8 5G and the Realme 8, anyone shopping for one of the brand’s latest budget phones faces an interesting proposition. With an identical price of £199/€199, do you choose next-gen network connectivity or a slightly more capable but 4G-only alternative?
We’ve already shared our thoughts on the Realme 8 5G side of this particular equation. Now it’s time to run the numbers on the ‘vanilla’ Realme 8, which also happens to be the direct follow-up to the Realme 7, one of the best cheap phones of 2020.
The key points of difference between the Realme 8 and the Realme 8 5G are a slightly faster CPU, a slower but more vibrant AMOLED display, a superior 64-megapixel main camera, and a slightly snazzier design. 
But is that enough to remain competitive in a section of the market that includes the mighty Poco X3 NFC? Let’s find out.
Design and screen
Thin and light, if slightly dullIn-display fingerprint sensor can be hit and missVibrant AMOLED display
The main difference between the design of the Realme 8 and the Realme 8 5G lies in what the company calls its “Infinite Bold Design”. This essentially translates to slapping a “Dare To Leap” slogan down one side of the rear of the phone in big bold type, overlaid by a rainbow-hued finish.

It’s a bold approach that’s shared by the Realme 8 Pro, and it proves similarly divisive. 
Like that handset, the combination of a shouty logo with a plastic body results in a device that feels somewhat cheap and tacky. The Realme 8 comes in the more muted Cyber Black, which lends it a little more class over the dazzling Cyber Silver. Nevertheless, both models are highly reflective, and the black version in particular is very susceptible to fingerprint smudges.
Like the Realme 8 5G, the Realme 8 feels reassuringly solid. It’s actually quite a bit thinner (8mm vs 8.5mm) and lighter (177g vs 185g) than its 5G-equipped brother, but there’s a similarly reassuring lack of flex and creak.
The Realme 8 follows the Realme 8 Pro in opting for an in-display fingerprint sensor rather than the 5G’s side-mounted method. This would widely be seen as a more premium touch – but, as it was on the Realme 8 Pro, I actually found it to be a little temperamental. In fact, early on, I even wiped and re-enrolled my fingerprints after a whole series of failures. 
The display itself marks another difference between the Realme 8 and its 5G sibling. It’s only a smidgen smaller at 6.4 inches rather than 6.5 inches, with a similar 1080 x 2400 (FHD+) resolution. 

The big difference is that the Realme 8 opts for AMOLED rather than LCD panel technology. The result is a much more vibrant, HDR-friendly screen, and a higher peak brightness of 1000 nits. As budget phone displays go, it’s very pleasant to behold.
There are no pre-set vibrancy modes, just a simple slider to make the tone warmer or cooler. It’s far from the best OLED display, but it results in a more nuanced picture with better contrast than its brother. 
Conversely, the Realme 8 display has no higher refresh rate option, unlike the 90Hz Realme 8 5G. Just like the Realme 8 Pro, you’ll have to make do with a bog standard 60Hz. 
I have slightly mixed feelings about high refresh rate displays in budget phones, where there’s seldom the hardware in place to do a full 120Hz screen justice. Even the mighty Poco X3 NFC doesn’t manage a seamless 120Hz experience. Raising the refresh rate undeniably improves the general navigation experience overall, and it’s missed here, but it isn’t the essential provision that some would claim it to be.
On balance, I’d take the Realme 8’s 60Hz AMOLED over the Realme 8 5G’s 90Hz LCD. But if you value smooth scrolling above visual fidelity, the 5G is the way to go.
Camera
Main sensor decent in good lightingIssues with the focussingPoor ultrawide
On the surface, the Realme 8’s camera system would appear to hold an advantage over the Realme 8 5G. It’s led by a more pixel-packed 64-megapixel wide sensor (the 5G’s is 48 megapixels), and unlike its well-connected brother, the Realme 8 features a dedicated ultrawide.

It isn’t quite as simple as that, however. In good lighting, the Realme 8 takes nice, vibrant albeit oversharpened shots. There isn’t a great deal in it, but I found images displayed deeper colours and superior contrast to those of the Realme 8 5G.
Those extra pixels also help with zoomed-in shots. In the absence of a dedicated telephoto, the Realme 8’s 2x shots pack more detail and definition than those of their brother. I wouldn’t bother with the 5x option, though; the lack of definition will make your eyes hurt.

Zoom at 2X
Zoom at 5X
However, as soon as the light begins to drop, the Realme 8 camera seems to struggle. Taking shots indoors during the day, it would take an age to lock onto the subject – even once it did, the resulting shots were often blurry. Even on activating the Night mode in these conditions (which would typically be overkill), the results were murkier than their Realme 8 5G equivalents.


That followed through to genuine night-time conditions, where I sometimes found myself questioning whether the Realme 8’s Night mode was even engaged. Sure, the delayed shutter and extended processing was there in the moment, but the results didn’t appear particularly bright, even compared to the Realme 8 5G.
There’s something to be said for a more subtle Night mode that doesn’t bleach everything out – especially in a cheap phone. And the Realme 8’s approach means less noise than rivals such as the Oppo A54. But the Realme 8 doesn’t go quite as far as its sibling.
Better by day, worse by night, then. But as I’ve already mentioned, the Realme 8 has one more ace up its sleeve compared to its 5G brother – an 8-megapixel ultrawide sensor.
Ultrawide
Its very inclusion has to be seen as an improvement over the Realme 8 5G, which provides no way to take those zoomed-out landscape shots. That said, they’re not very good quality, with a more washed-out palette than the main sensor and noticeable softness around the edges.
Photos taken using the 2-megapixel macro camera are exactly what we’ve come to expect from such a lens – fine in thumbnail form, but a blurry, noisy mess as soon as you transfer them to a larger screen.
Macro
Performance
Mediocre overall performance, but strong for gamingSome issues with call qualitySoftware can be glitchy
In our Realme 7 review last year, we spoke of its “average day-to-day performance”. I am a little disappointed to report that nothing has changed with the Realme 8, mainly down to its use of an identical MediaTek Helio G95 SoC.
This humble 12nm chip is sufficient for generally fluid performance. The lack of a 90Hz or 120Hz display helps cover for some of the stutters you’ll often experience in a rival budget phone, although you’ll observe the odd pause when opening apps.
Note, too, that while the handset I was sent employed 6GB of RAM, there are 4GB and 8GB models available. Opting for the lowest model, if it’s on offer in your region, could potentially impact the fluidity of app switching.

The inclusion of an advanced Copper Liquid Cooling System means that there have been some year-on-year performance gains over the Realme 7. This apparently boosts the chip’s cooling efficiency, enabling it to run faster for longer.
Make no mistake, though, this is a budget phone through and through. A Geekbench 5 multicore score of 1692 tells you as much. This result places it a smidgen behind the Realme 8 5G with its Dimensity 700 5G chip on 1749, as well as the Poco X3 NFC and its Snapdragon 732G on 1769.
Geekbench is a CPU-focused benchmark, of course. When it comes to the GPU, the Realme 8 burns past its 5G-focused brother. It managed a 3DMark Wildlife score of 1467 compared to the Realme 8 5G’s 1095, making it more comparable with the Poco X3 NFC in the graphical output stakes.
This is reflected when you boot up PUBG Mobile, where the graphical settings default to HD with a High frame rate. That’s the kind of setting you might expect to see in phones costing double the money – although you’re not able to crank things up any further. Performance is reasonably fluid, too, albeit not to the silkiest degree of the true flagships.
We only really mention call quality these days when there’s something negative to report – and, sadly, that’s the case here. During my week with the Realme 8, several calls were heavily broken up with an accompanying robotic tinge to the voice on the other end. The other party always claimed to be able to hear me just fine on these occasions, but quickly switching my SIM to another phone yielded perfectly clear results.
The phone runs on Android 11 and Realme UI 2.0, which is generally a pretty competent Android skin. It’s as smooth and uncluttered here as it is on the Realme 8 5G.
Call quality wasn’t the only glitch I experienced during my time with the Realme 8, though. There was a weird bug that seemed to refuse to recognise links to places in Google Maps, or to a poll widget in Facebook. I also encountered some disconcerting visual glitches when browsing web content through Google Feed, which is situated to the left of the main homescreen as it should be.
Such bugs and glitches are typically temporary, of course, and may not even be an issue for everyone. I’m simply reporting my experience.

Otherwise, Realme UI 2.0 is a solid if slightly crude interface. Like most of its budget competitors from the likes of Xiaomi and Oppo, it defaults to a curiously retrograde homescreen set-up of virtual buttons and no always-on display. It’s good that you can change these basic functions, but why not lean into them from the off?
Another touch that grates is the way the phone emits a loud notification to indicate that it’s entered optimised night charging mode – often at the point I had begun nodding off. Thanks for the early alarm, Realme.
Just as there are touches that annoy, so there are a handful of small inclusions that struck me as thoughtful. Not every manufacturer bothers to include Google Keep in its suite of preinstalled apps, for example, but Realme does here. 
The company has also refrained from going big on the bloatware here in the West – which wasn’t the case with the Asia-focused Realme 8 5G model I reviewed. There are homebrewed apps for videos, photos, music, and all the usual stock tools, but there’s no superfluous secondary web browser as is the case with many of its rivals. 
On the (non-Google) third-party app front, meanwhile, all you have to deal with is the ubiquitous Facebook.
Battery life
Big 5000mAh batteryGood for two days of moderate use30w charging is welcome
The Realme 8 comes packing a large 5000mAh battery, which is the same as the Realme 8 5G. Unlike that latter phone, of course, you don’t have to worry about occasional 5G connectivity or a high refresh rate display sucking any extra juice.
Sure enough, this phone is an absolute stamina champ. I found myself able to get to the end of a moderately busy day of around 5 hours’ screen-on time with around 50% left in the tank. One mammoth spell of two and a half days and 11 hours of screen-on time still left me with 30% to play with.
Light to moderate users will be able to clear two full days between charges without issue, which is the holy grail when it comes to smartphone battery life.
Heavier media consumption and gaming will hit the Realme 8 battery harder, but it stands up well nonetheless. After 30 minutes of PUBG Mobile, I found that my handset had lost 7% of its power. That’s about half the loss of pricier flagship phones – although, again, they have more powerful components and more demanding visual settings to deal with.
One hour of video streaming sapped 3% of the Realme 8’s battery, which is a very good result indeed. Curiously, the Realme 8 5G lost 8% in similar tests.
Recharging is another way in which the Realme 8 bloodies the nose of its 5G brother. It comes bundled with a 30W brick compared to the Realme 8 5G’s 18W. In my tests, this will see you from 0 to 50% in 26 minutes, and 0 to 100% in 67 minutes – which is pretty much as Realme states.

Should you buy it?


You want two-day battery life: The Realme 8 will see you through two full days, thanks to a large battery and power-sipping components.


You like clean, unassuming design: The Realme 8’s shouty slogan-based design isn’t for fans of subtly or understatement









Verdict
The Realme 8 is a perfectly capable addition to the £200 smartphone category, with an attractive AMOLED display, strong gaming performance, and stellar battery life. It’s not one of the best phones around though, even at the price.It lacks the all-around game of the Poco X3 NFC; its slogan-heavy design is a touch wearisome, and our review model displayed some irritatingly glitchy behaviour. Generally speaking, it’s the better pick over the compromised Realme 8 5G, unless 5G is an absolute necessity. Even then, you can do better for the money.

Huawei is back with the Huawei Watch 3. The original Huawei Watch was among the best smartwatches you could get back in the day, but the line was seemingly forgotten after the launch of the Watch 2 in 2017, with no word of a follow-up until now.
It had that classic watch design that seemed to strike a chord with early adopters and even years after it was on the scene, many hoped it would make a comeback. Huawei decided to take its smartwatches in a different direction with the Watch GT, a smartwatch that swapped Android Wear/Wear OS for its in-house LiteOS, putting a greater emphasis on fitness tracking and achieving better battery life.
Now in 2021, the acclaimed wearable has made its grand return. The Huawei Watch 3 and Watch 3 Pro arrive with bigger price tags than the Huawei Watch GT 2 series (outside of the Watch GT 2 Pro and Porsche Design edition) and crucially, both devices employ the new Harmony OS platform, giving us a sense of where Huawei plans to go next on the software front.
The Huawei Watch 3 will retail for £349.99 (roughly $495, €406) however no official US or European pricing has been unveiled at this time.
Design and screen
Great, sharp AMOLED screenWatch 3 Pro offers a bigger watch caseUses nicer stainless steel and ceramic materialsAdded rotating crown to match Apple Watch Digital Crown
Huawei sticks to the same rounded design philosophy used on the GT for the Watch 3, shifting to nicer case materials and an improved display to set it apart from the likes of the Watch GT 2 and the Watch GT 2e.
There’s a 46mm chassis to match the largest Watch GT 2 option which comes in Active, Classic and Elite editions. That means you have the option of something that’s better suited to exercise, a more classic Huawei Watch look or even an all in metal design if you prefer a formal-friendly watch. All models offer stainless steel cases and ceramic backs, which is a move away from the plastic used on the cheaper GT 2 models.

There is also a Huawei Watch 3 Pro, which grows the case size to 48mm and swaps the stainless steel for titanium. It comes in Classic and Elite editions with both options definitely veering towards that more classic watch aesthetic.
I had the more minimalist-looking Active edition to live with, which does conjure up feelings of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active with its all-black case and fluoroelastomer strap. 
It measures 12.15mm thick and weighs 54g, and in general it has been a comfortable watch to wear throughout the day, during exercise and overnight. 
The traditional watch buckle keeps things securely in place and the bands can be simply removed from the case if you want to switch things up. It might not be the most exciting of looks, but if you prefer a simpler, less dressy feel, the Active edition is one we think you’ll get on with. 
The only thing breaking up that otherwise streamlined case design is the solitary physical button and a new rotating crown. If it sounds like the Apple Watch Digital Crown, well, it works in a similar fashion, letting you twist to scroll through screens and press to open the grid app launcher. The solitary button on the other hands gives you a shortcut to the workout tracking features. 
There’s a crown for navigation
The displays used on Huawei’s GT watches have been a highlight and it’s good to see that things have actually got even better. The Watch 3 and the Watch 3 Pro feature a larger 1.43-inch, 466 x 466 resolution AMOLED screen that’s exceptionally sharp and has all the qualities of a great AMOLED display. It has those deep blacks, accurate colours and whether it’s widgets or watch faces, everything looks great here. 
Visibility in general has been good for too. It can invariably struggle a little in bright outdoor light, but it certainly isn’t bad enough to be a proper nuisance. At the time of this review, there isn’t the option of an always-on display mode, which did appear on the Watch GT, but this might be one of the features Huawei is primed to add at a later date.
Features and performance 
HarmonyOS feels slick to useiPhone users will miss out on some featuresNo payment support in the UKThe Celia smart assistant is good for simple queries
The Huawei Watch 3 is the first smartwatch from the company to run on its own HarmonyOS. This software is set to run a host of different devices including the MatePad Pro, Huawei P50, smart scales, action cameras and more. The view is to create a platform where devices can seamlessly talk and connect to each other. 
On the Watch 3, HarmonyOS’s presence seems to be represented by some UI tweaks, a grid launcher that looks inspired by Apple’s honeycomb one and extra animations that you currently won’t find on the Watch GT 2. 
It’s a slick experience though, with Huawei employing an unnamed dual-core processor with 16GB of storage and 2GB RAM. Swiping through screens has a satisfying zip to it and there are no slow loading apps here either.
Apps are shown in a grid
It’s also geared to offer the kind of smartwatch experience that seems to be more on par with what the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google’s platform have to offer. The Watch 3 will work with Android phones and iPhones, but like the GT series, you’ll get the most complete experience when it’s paired to an Android phone. In doing so, you can make use of the built-in music player and download and make the new animated watch faces.
You do get the ability to view notifications, but you can’t respond to them. Huawei is bringing back the eSim it offered on the Huawei Watch 2 in China back in 2018.

In the UK, Vodafone will be offering that LTE support, but I haven’t had the opportunity to try it out yet. Huawei is also bringing its AppGallery storefront into the fold and hoping developers will have the appetite to build apps for another new smartwatch platform. 
It’s pretty limited at the moment, but the experience of using the app store on the watch feels much nicer than it using Google’s Play Store on Wear OS watches. If Huawei can get some big names on board here, this could be a big plus for Huawei – but it’s a big if. 

Something that doesn’t make the cut here is some form of payment support. At least, there’s no support in the UK as things stand. NFC functionality is available, but it remains to be seen if Huawei will look to give the Watch 3 some payment love in the future.
Luckily you are getting a microphone and speaker on board here, partially to take calls but also to bring Huawei’s Celia smart assistant into the fold. The presence of smart assistants on smartwatches hasn’t massively impressed across the board, with Alexa on Fitbit and Apple’s Siri being the notable exceptions. 
You can launch Celia by uttering the words, ‘Hey, Celia’ and proceed to ask questions with responses read out loud. You have to keep it simple though with questions about the weather or checking your heart rate. 

Ask it to tell you when England’s next game is and it’s a question too complex for this assistant. It clearly lacks the context and depth of similar AI tech like Alexa.
Fitness tracking 
Sports tracking modes perform much like same features on Watch GT 2 Added temperature sensor doesn’t feel all that useful yetHeart rate accuracy still not great for 24/7 and exercise trackingNavigation features are on the way 
When it comes to using the Huawei Watch 3 for tracking steps, heart rate or logging runs and swims, the experience is nearly identical to using one of the Huawei Watch GT 2 series watches.
That’s because you’re getting largely the same workout modes, screens and data on the Watch 3. It’s not actually a bad thing, because Huawei’s approach to sports tracking is a positive on the whole.
There’s an optical heart rate monitor
All the key hardware is here like built-in GPS and Huawei’s latest TruSeen 4.5 optical heart rate monitor, which is set up to improve accuracy over Huawei’s other watches. That same sensor is used to generate SpO2 measurements and there’s also stress tracking and fitness tracking staples such as sleep monitoring. 
The Watch 3 has now introduced a skin temperature sensor, but like the other onboard health sensors, this feature hasn’t been given any sort of regulatory approval, having been made just for wellness and general fitness purposes. Joining Apple and Samsung, Huawei has also added an emergency SOS mode and fall detection modes here too.

If you opt for the Watch 3 Pro, that will additionally give you Huawei’s new dual-channel GPS, which it claims can better the Apple Watch 6 for accuracy.
Huawei is offering 100 workout modes with 19 professional ones that offer richer metrics and 6 modes that offer automatic exercise detection. There’s still the Running guides from the GT series watches and it’s also delivering performance insights like VO2 Max and aerobic/anaerobic training load stats to make sure you’re better managing how much you train and when. 
From a performance point of view, the experience feels like a very similar story to what you’ll find on any of the Huawei Watch GT 2 series. 
It holds up well for GPS accuracy during outdoor activities, though it still generally came up a little short (around 0.5km) on the runs I tested it on against the high-end Garmin Enduro sports watch. It performed well on pool swims and tracked near-identical data with the Garmin Enduro, as well as Form’s very reliable Swim Goggles. 
Heart rate monitoring both in a continuous state and during exercise always seemed too high. Resting heart rate was generally 10-15BPM higher than readings on a clinical grade heart rate monitor on a pulse oximeter, and a Fitbit Sense smartwatch I have come to rely on which delivers reliable resting HR data. It was a similar story during exercise, where heart rate data in general seemed significantly higher than what I got from a Garmin HRM-Pro chest strap monitor.
As a fitness tracker, you’ve got a nice ring-style widget on the watch to keep track of your daily progress and animated inactivity alerts when you’ve not been moving around enough. 
The Huawei Health app
This data along with sleep is all viewed back inside of the Huawei Health app, though sleep tracking was hit and miss during testing. While it largely matched up to the sleep stats on a Fitbit Sense, there were some nights where it logged just a few hours of sleep. I know I sleep badly sometimes, but definitely not to that extent.

Huawei is planning to bring more features to improve the tracking experience. It’s adding Petal Maps to offer navigation that looks set to be utilised by third party apps with popular mapping app Komoot named as one of the apps coming to Huawei’s App Gallery. 
Bottom line, if you’ve used a Huawei Watch GT 2, a lot of what you get there is the same. You might be getting an extra sensor and some extra workout modes, but that’s really about it at the moment.
Battery life 
Just 2-3 days in full smartwatch mode feels like a backwards stepUltra-long battery mode still makes a lot of key features available Reverse charging with Huawei phones a nice extra
Delivering big battery life was one of the reasons Huawei decided to give smartwatches a rethink when it appeared to take a break from smartwatches after launching the Huawei Watch 2. With the Watch GT,  it delivered weeks of battery life as opposed to days and the Huawei Watch 3 aims to build on that – to a degree.
With the Huawei Watch 3, you’re faced really with two different battery scenarios. 
When you’re using the watch in full smart mode with all features in use, Huawei says you should get three days when paired to an Android phone and just 1.5 days paired to an iPhone. My experience with it paired to an Android phone was that it lasted 2.5-3 days with a drop-off of over 30%.
While using its sports tracking features, just over an hour of running saw the battery drop off by 20% compared to just 8% on an Apple Watch Series 6.

Huawei does also offer an ultra-long battery life mode, which the company says can offer up to 14 days. In this mode, Huawei restricts you to just a single analogue face, whilst removing access to some apps and features like its Celia smart assistant and various HarmonyOS UI flourishes. 
You can still access and use a fair amount still. For instance, you can receive notifications, access workout tracking and monitor temperature and heart rate. It’s almost like stripping things back to just using LiteOS on a Watch GT 2. 
There’s an ultra-long battery life mode
Battery drop-off in this mode, even with some workout tracking was around 10%, which would work out to around 10 days. The Watch 3 is clearly capable of going further without greatly reducing the features you have at your disposal.
As an added bonus, Huawei also offers reverse charging in the device, which means you can use compatible Huawei phones to power up your Watch if you’re not close to a charging point.

Should you buy it?


Only if you own an Android phone: The Huawei Watch 3 with HarmonyOS is a slick operator that is set to get better with upcoming updates. It’s got a great screen, feels nice to wear and has a strong set of smartwatch, fitness and health features.


You want the best smartwatch features: While it is compatible with Apple’s smartphones, you don’t get the full array of features available to Android phone users and you’ll have to deal with battery in full smartwatch mode that’s not that much better than what’s on offer on the Apple Watch.









Verdict
The Huawei Watch 3 feels a lot like a Huawei Watch GT 2 though it does a better balance of matching its solid fitness and sports tracking skills with smartwatch features to make it a better alternative to Samsung’s Galaxy Watch and the Fitbit’s smartwatches. Some missing features for iPhone users and the drop in battery life doesn’t quite make it a match for the Apple Watch, but the Huawei Watch 3 could emerge as the best smartwatch for Android users. Especially as Samsung looks to a smartwatch future where it’s hoping its own Tizen OS combined with Google’s Wear will give it a better chance of competing with Apple.

Verdict


































By not following the blueprint of pretty much every other Android phone, Asus has found a niche for the Zenfone 8. If you’re after an iPhone 12-sized Android phone with top-tier specs then this device is an excellent option.

Cons
Can get hot when gamingNo telephoto cameraNo wireless charging

Key Features




High peformance:Snapdragon 888, up to 16GB RAM and 5G


Display:5.9-inch OLED display is smaller than many rivals


Battery:4000mAh cell with 30w charging


Introduction
The Asus Zenfone 8 could have ended up being just another Android phone in the same ilk as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus, OnePlus 9 and so on. 
Instead, Asus has made a clever decision to try to help this stand out among the other best Android phones around. Unlike its competition, the Asus ZenFone 8 is small – as in iPhone 12-level tiny.
Design and Screen
The 5.9-inch screen is one of the smaller optionsOLED panel is of high qualitySimilar size device to the iPhone 12
Having a device with a sub-6-inch display is rare in the Android space, and handsets that have been released recently (Pixel 4a, Pixel 5) can’t really be classed as full flagship devices as they use more modest internal parts.
The Zenfone 8 isn’t being marketed as a ‘Mini’ or ‘Lite’ version of a larger device – this is the true Zenfone flagship for the year. It’s exceptionally pocketable, seriously light at 169g and is still feature-rich.
This isn’t as compact a device as the iPhone 12 Mini; it’s just slightly smaller than the iPhone 12. This is a good move on Asus’ part, since going as small as Apple’s Mini phone would have likely put more people off than those who would have been enticed by the idea. The size here feels like a decent compromise, and the device should certainly be of interest to anyone who feels Android phones are generally too big.

Size aside, the Zenfone 8 feels great. The metal back is heavily curved to nestle comfortably in your palm, and while it isn’t the thinnest device, there is room for a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top. There’s a USB-C port along the bottom edge, and there’s a pop of colour from a blue power button. You even get a notification/charging LED next to the USB-C port and an IP68 rating. 
It’s a simple design, but it looks smart and subtle. 
The front is home to a 5.9-inch flat display. It’s smaller than most, although I’ve found it more than adequate for gaming and watching videos. It’s also the ideal size for navigating with one hand, something that’s made even better by the iOS-like one-handed mode that shunts the whole interface down. 
Asus might have opted for a smaller screen, but it hasn’t skimped on the tech powering the panel. The 1080p Samsung OLED E4 panel offers wide HDR support, Gorilla Glass Victus, a reported 1100 nits of brightness, an in-display fingerprint sensor and 120Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and responsive gaming. 
These are all top of the line specs on a par, if not better, than most of the other flagships I’ve tested this year.
HDR content from Netflix really shows off the quality of the screen, with that added brightness giving an extra pop to explosions and the like. I can’t see many buying a smaller phone for video binges, but at least the quality is there if you do want to do that.
Zenfone 8 and iPhone 12
While the display isn’t adaptive in the same way as the panel that features on the OnePlus 9 Pro, you can switch between 60Hz, 90Hz or 120Hz, or have the system automatically switch it for you. 
I left the auto option on for a while; however, the screen never seemed to switch all the way up to 120Hz, instead mostly sticking at 90Hz. I’m a sucker for that smooth 120Hz goodness, so I forced it to stick to that all the time out of habit. If you want to push the battery life longer, keep the auto mode on or drop it down to 60Hz.
This is an excellent screen with a seriously wide range of customisation options for tweaking colours and gamuts if you’re into that kind of thing.
Camera
Two cameras on the backZoom is purely digitalCapable of shooting 8K video
The one area where sacrifices have been made to keep the size of the unit down is the camera set-up. There are only two sensors on the back, with a zoom lens scrapped due to lack of space. 

The main camera is a 64-megapixel Sony IM686 sensor with optical image stabilisation (OIS), an f/1.7 aperture and 8K video recording. This is paired with a 12-megapixel Sony IMX636 ultra-wide sensor.
I’ve been shooting with the camera for a few weeks now and it can churn out decent shots. The colours are punchy, there’s plenty of detail and the app focuses quickly. However, there isn’t anything of note that stands out, with the camera processing often being a weak point for Asus. Sometimes colours in particularly bright scenarios are oversaturated and look a little garish – even though they looked fine as the shot was being taken.
It’s also not the most capable camera in lower-light situations. There’s a dedicated night mode that combines multiple exposures together to pull out more brightness from a shot and this is fine for landscapes, but it falls down when there’s too much movement.
Some tricky situations push the HDR mode a bit far
The camera here isn’t miles away from the Pixel 5 in regular lighting, however if camera quality is a key feature and you want a smaller phone, then Google’s offering might still be a better choice.
The secondary camera takes good ultra-wide shots and it’s nice for some added versatility, although there’s a noticeable colour shift between the camera sensors.
The regular camera is a lot brighter
(Ultrawide) The colours don’t match too well between the cameras
The lack of any sort of zoom – aside from the digital option – is a shame but hardly a surprise. The similarly-sized iPhone 12 lacks telephoto zoom and you won’t find it on the Pixel 5 either.
The zoom skills are limited to digital cropping
Performance
Seriously powerful for the sizeSnapdragon 888, up to 16GB RAM5G support
The most surprising aspect about the Zenfone 8 is just how many top-end specs Asus has crammed inside its tiny frame. 
It is usual for smaller phones to skimp on the internals, offering mid-range chipsets – but this isn’t the case here. Powering the phone is a Snapdragon 888 platform with 5G and up to 16GB LPDDR5 RAM. While there’s no expandable storage, the 256GB UFS 3.1 storage should be sufficient for most. It even has excellent sounding, front-firing stereo speakers that sound better than many pricier phones.
I’ve been using the phone for a number of weeks now and it’s seriously fast in all situations, whether that’s gaming or just day-to-day business. As with any device that’s powered by this chipset, any game from Google Play runs with ease. I have noticed that the phone can run hot when playing particularly demanding games, something I haven’t seen too often with Android phones.
A few quick benchmarks back this real world use, with Geekbench 5 scores of 1119 (single-core) and 3689 (multi-core) comparing well to other high-end phones.
It’s been a few years since I’ve properly used an Asus phone over an extended period and I can’t say I was too enthused about the software back then. It’s a different story now, with the UI here packing many of the design elements typically referred to as ‘stock Android’. It’s clean, with an emphasis on Google’s own apps and services but with an added layer of depth that you just don’t see on the brand’s Pixel phones.
You have deep control of the display, performance and there are even customisations on offer for the button on the side. It’s a similar story for the battery, too. There are options to limit charging to a certain percentage to eke out more life from the cell.
Asus has said the Zenfone 8 will receive a further two years of Android updates along with the accompanying security patches. Two years of updates are, of course, better than one (or none, which is fairly common) but it falls below the three offered on flagship phones from the likes of Samsung.
Battery life
Good battery life, but far from the best30w chargingCharger included
The Zenfone includes a 4000mAh battery with 30W fast charging (and an included power brick). Wireless charging is missing, though. 
4000mAh might seem small when compared to some of the other best phones around, however with the smaller display, it can still hold its own. 

During testing, I have found that the Zenfone 8 gets me comfortably through a day with between five to six hours of screen time. I’d class this as quite heavy use, so if you’re a lighter user then you shouldn’t struggle at all to go from morning until night without reaching for a cable.
This is less than what you’ll find with larger phones, where screen-on time can often hit eight hours, however it is better than an iPhone 12, and far superior to the 12 Mini. The Zenfone 8 is far from a battery life champion but it’s still more than capable.
Asus has integrated a number of neat battery modes too. You can lower performance to get a little more juice or only allow the battery to charge to a certain percentage to hopefully give it more life. I haven’t spent enough time with the phone to judge whether these make any worthwhile difference but the options are always nice to have.
In terms of charging, there’s a 30w plug included that got me a full charge in 61 minutes. A quicker charge to 50% was completed in around 25 minutes.

Should you buy it?


If you find most Android phones too big, but aren’t willing to sacrifice performance, this is the phone for you.


While the battery life is fine, you do get longer endurance with larger Android phones with bigger cells. The lack of any decent zoom skills on the camera is a shame too.









Verdict
Asus has found a niche for the Zenfone 8 and I absolutely love it. If you’re after a smaller Android phone with top-tier specs that doesn’t break the bank then this device should tick all the boxes. It’s got a great screen, speaker and performance and is very smartly designed.

Verdict


































The iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2021) is a triumph in terms of hardware. The screen is the best I have ever seen on a tablet and the M1 chip powering everything is capable of great things. The only missing piece is the software – which still feels restrictive.

Cons

Up to 2TB storageYou can add up to 2TB of storage however you’ll have to spend big


Introduction
The iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2021 is Apple’s most ambitious tablet yet and a showcase for tech that could eventually hit devices like the MacBook Pro and iPhone.
This isn’t a tablet for the odd email reply or entertaining the kids during a long car ride. The new iPad Pro is a high-end machine with the same chipset as the new iMac M1 and a mobile screen that’s bolder and brighter than anything I have seen from Apple before.
On a technical level this is the best tablet you can find, but it’s not right for everyone. After over a week with it I can confirm that you need to really be committed to the ultimate iPad Pro experience for this to be worth the high asking price.
Pricing
Pricing for the iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2021 starts at £999/$1099 for the 128GB model – which we’d avoid if you plan to do serious work on the device. It then increases as you add more storage space. You can see prices for the other storage options below.

Design and Screen
The mini-LED 12.9-inch screen is the best mobile panel for HDR contentThe tablet retains the same design introduced in 2018The new iPad Pro comes in grey and silver colour options
Apple has differentiated the two available sizes of the iPad Pro quite a lot this year, kitting the pricier and larger 12.9-inch model out with a completely new display that gives it far better HDR (high dynamic range) performance. If you choose the 11-inch model it’s very much the same display as the last two models I reviewed many moons ago.


I’ve been using the 12.9-inch model, so that’ll be what this review focuses on and it’s here where the screen really shines. Previous iPad Pro models have had excellent panels, however this is a step above anything I’ve experienced before. I’d comfortably say this is the best screen I have ever used on a tablet, especially for watching video.

The new tech here is mini-LED, which is taking over from the previous LED and the result is a little more like the OLED panel from an iPhone 12 Pro, Apple Watch 6 or some of the best TVs around. Like OLED, mini-LED offers far deeper, inkier blacks along with improved contrast and richer colours.
The screen is excellent for HDR video
OLED and LCD both have strengths and weaknesses. OLED, for example, is expensive and hard to produce and can suffer from lower brightness levels at larger sizes – however the use of individually lit pixels give it amazing inky blacks and vivid colours.
LCD can often be brighter and cheaper, but the use of a backlight to illuminate those pixels means that blacks look more grey. This is where mini-LED comes in.
To try and recreate the deep blacks that make OLED so great, this panel uses over 10000 LEDs and 2500 dimming zones so that every part of the display can be lit precisely.
The result is a stunning display for watching back HDR content. Blacks are now properly black and this is especially obvious in those chunky bars that sit above and below most videos. These now just about match up with the black rim of the iPad Pro, instead of looking grey.
Apps like Netflix, iTunes and Disney Plus support HDR content
If you really want to see where this screen shines then load up some HDR content. The opening scenes in John Wick 3 with the rain-soaked, neon-lit New York sparkle in a way you’d usually only find on a high-end TV. Load up Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and the colours, especially the bright reds, pop with punch and clarity. In The Empire Strikes Back, the scenes in space are near perfectly black and so immersive.


I’ve watched countless movies throughout the past week on the iPad Pro and every time I continue to be impressed. Apple says the brightness levels can reach 1600 nits for things like explosions, while a more stable level of 1000 is achievable in HDR scenes.

During lab testing, I got a strong 525 nits of brightness using a colourimeter which isn’t far off the 600 nits claimed by Apple for regular use. The same colourimeter gave me an impressive colour temperature reading, perfect blacks and fantastic contrast.
Even titles that aren’t HDR have extra deepness in the blacks and more vivid colours than most of the other tablets to pass through Trusted Labs recently. Whatever you watch here will look better than previous iPads.
The screen remains great in other situations, however this was a strong skill of the previous Pro models and the difference is less noticeable in everyday use, at least to my eye. There’s more punch and brightness to photos shot in HDR on an iPhone and you get those vibrant colours throughout.
Screens are rarely perfect though and the mini-LED panel does have one notable drawback. I have noticed times where blooming is visible, wherein bright elements on black backgrounds can have softer white outlines that glow with a halo effect. This isn’t a deal-breaker for me and it’s not consistent, but my experience does seem better than some others reviewing the device.
The panel packs a 120Hz refresh rate (this is across both Pro sizes) that adapts to what you’re doing; ramping up to make scrolling and gaming more responsive and down again when you’re reading or watching a film. Hopefully this will be the year Apple finally brings this ProMotion tech to its smartphones with the iPhone 13.
While the screen may have seen huge upgrades, the design is very much the same as the two previous iterations. The industrial, squared-off look Apple debuted in 2018 has spread across much of its product line, from iPhone 12 to iMac, and the iPad Pro 2021 remains the best looking tablet I have ever reviewed. 
This model is ever-so-slightly thicker – likely to accommodate the upgraded screen and bigger battery – and heavier. However, you’ll only notice this if you’re directly upgrading from the 2020 model and comparing the two.
Each variation has two very good sets of speakers for excellent audio, while the Apple Pencil charging pad sits on the top (or the side if you’re holding the tablet vertically). There’s no headphone jack, with the only port here being a Thunderbolt connector.
The speakers are excellent
My only issue is that it would have been nice to have a few more colour options, as the grey and silver choices are a little dull. A blue colour, similar to the iPhone 12 Pro variant, would have looked great – as would the green from the 11 Pro. 
Performance and software
The iPad Pro 2021 is powered by the same M1 chip as the MacBook ProRAM options depend on storage sizeThe software is the only thing holding the tablet back
The iPad Pro 2021 is powered by the same Apple-designed M1 chip that also sits inside the iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Air. It has the same 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU as the higher-end iMac and comes with either 8 or 16GB RAM. Apple has never revealed how much RAM sits inside an iPad before, so this is quite the departure.
The only way to get 16GB RAM is to buy either the 1TB or 2TB storage options, with the 128, 256 and 512GB variations all coming with 8GB. I’ve been using the 512GB model with 8GB RAM and haven’t noticed any situations where more memory would be needed, however this could always change depending on what plans Apple has for the iPad Pro with iOS 15.
It seems frankly wild to me that Apple has crammed a desktop-class chip inside a device as portable as the iPad Pro and the performance gains here are far beyond anything I have seen from a tablet before. In Geekbench 5, for example, the iPad Pro 2021 scores 7281 in the multi-core test – that’s not far off double the 4612 scored by the 2020 version.
Benchmarks in Geekbench are impressive
Benchmarks numbers are great, but we always say it’s the real-world situations that are really important. And well, that’s where the iPad Pro 2021 falls down a bit.
This isn’t because it’s slow – quite the opposite. It’s just that there’s nothing really out there to push the M1 at the moment. Considering there wasn’t much out there that would push the older A12Z or A12X, this shouldn’t be much of a surprise.
While this iPad Pro does use the same silicon as the MacBooks and iMac, it doesn’t run macOS like those machines. Instead, you’ve got the same iPadOS that powers every iPad. If you were hoping this would be the first touchscreen Mac with access to every Mac app under the sun, including Apple’s Pro tools and the full versions of Adobe Photoshop, then you’ll need to temper your expectations.

The iPad Pro 2021 has the potential to run those apps, but Apple can’t sell an iPad pricier (when you add a keyboard) than its MacBook Air on pure potential. Until there are more apps and games that can really push the M1, this specific aspect doesn’t feel like a huge upgrade on the previous model.
There are, of course, performance gains though none of them are a true reason to upgrade or choose this iPad simply for the chip. Apps opened marginally faster and a 20 minute 4K stream from iMovie exported a few minutes faster than the 2020 iPad Pro. I didn’t notice any performance boosts in games though – which is a shame considering it is well known the GPU here is very capable.
I think iPadOS is great on smaller tablets like the base iPad 8 and the iPad Air 4. It works well on the sizes those tablets come in and the processors they’re powered by. On the Pro models however, it’s a different story. I would love to use the iPad Pro 12.9-inch as my main laptop. It’s got a wonderful screen that’s better than a MacBook, 5G support, loads of creative apps and compatibility with the excellent Apple Pencil – but it’s frustrating in so many ways. 

While the switch to Thunderbolt (rather than standard USB-C) lets you connect it to the 6K Retina XDR Display (I’d be interested to know who uses this workflow) it still doesn’t output properly to a display. You get these black bars on either side and most apps stay that way throughout.
The multitasking also feels limited on such a big display. You still can’t minimise apps into smaller windows and you have to stick to Apple’s rigid side-by-side layout if you want two apps open at once. There’s always the chance Apple will remedy this in iOS 15 (or iOS 16) but I really wouldn’t bank on it.
Cameras
There are two cameras on the back and one on the front, all of which are very capable.
The biggest changes have come to the front 12MP camera, which is now much wider and uses a feature called Centre Stage for following your movement. It’s a bit like a software alternative to the moving camera on the latest Echo Show.

This is great for video chats, as the camera crops and zooms to make sure you’re always in the middle even if you’re wandering around the kitchen. It works in apps like Zoom and Facetime and does an excellent job – even if your colleagues might be a little unsure of what’s going on.
I would have liked Apple to move the front camera from the side to the top as this is a tablet you’ll mostly use horizontally. Instead, it always looks like I am looking past the screen and at something else during video meetings.
Accessories
There a few add-ons you can buy alongside the iPad Pro 2021 to amp up the experience. The Magic Keyboard ($349/£329) remains the same as before, just now in white, and it has the same pros and cons as when I reviewed it a year ago. It’s very expensive, but if you’re splurging over a grand on a tablet then you’ll probably want this too.
Due to this 2021 edition of the iPad Pro being thicker and heavier than the last, Apple doesn’t state that the previous Magic Keyboard works here. This is a bitter pill for anyone who shelled out last year and is upgrading to this iPad. However, I have tried it and does work, though whether the added weight will cause issues down the line remains to be seen.

The Apple Pencil ($129/£119) is another must. Well, it is if you have an interest in drawing or using the iPad Pro for taking notes. This is exactly the same stylus as before and still charges wirelessly on the top of the tablet.
5G and Wi-Fi
Apple has offered cellular options of the iPad for years, however this is the first time one supports 5G. I’d say 5G is actually better utilised on a tablet, especially one as productivity-focused on this.
There’s Wi-Fi 6 support too, another benefit if you have a router that supports it that improves key things, like multi-device support on a network and stability.
Battery Life
No real advancements in battery life18w charging via the Thunderbolt (USB-C) port
The iPad Pro 12.9-inch 2021 lasts roughly the same amount of time per charge as the previous models I reviewed, which is around the 10 hour mark that Apple claims. This of course varies depending on what you’re doing.
Maxing out the screen brightness and watching Spider-Man: Far From Home in HDR via iTunes took me down 5% in just 14 minutes during testing so you might want to ensure you’ve got a cable nearby. The same 14 minutes played on the 2020 iPad Pro took the battery down 2%. This is hardly a surprise considering the far greater brightness on offer here. It was a better story streaming via Netflix – an hour-long episode of Altered Carbon took the battery down by 8%.
You’ll also notice extra battery depletion if you’ve got the Magic Keyboard attached, which remains an intense battery hog. 

I used the tablet with the keyboard connected throughout a whole workday and was left with 55% left come 6pm. Excellent standby times meant that when I came to start work the next day the tablet had only lost 5% overnight. 
Apple has kept the charger in the box and the 18w brick charges the tablet to 50% in 65 minutes and to 100% in 162 minutes. This is fairly slow, especially compared to the Galaxy Tab S7 Plus.

Should you buy it?


You want the best display on a tablet: The XDR display is gorgeous and it’s the best choice around for enabling HDR workloads and watching HDR films and TV shows. It’s bright, colourful and so immersive.


Don’t buy the iPad Pro unless you really need the M1 chip or the mini-LED display. The iPad Air 4 is a great buy and far cheaper, plus for many the basic iPad will still get the job done.









Final Thoughts
The iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2021) has the best hardware I have ever seen on a tablet, but the software lacks the versatility to really make this a true MacBook replacement. It’s expensive too and the price jump from the previous model makes it even more of an investment.If you want the best tablet, with the best screen and the best performance then go for this. But for everyone else the iPad Air 4 is probably still a better buy.

Verdict































The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is a pricey phone with world-class specs, but as a whole, it isn’t always greater than the sum of its parts. This is the reason its excellent camera, flagship power, ultra-fast charging and stunning screen being set against chunky design, mediocre battery life and an occasionally clumsy interface hold it back from justifying its high price tag.

Introduction
Xiaomi has had plenty of success with budget smartphones, recently (and notably) with the confusingly good Redmi Note 10 Pro. However, can its confidently priced Mi 11 Ultra secure the same kind of success at the top-end of the market?
Looking at the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s specs, there’s no reason the £1199 (roughly $1600, €1199) handset can’t cement the brand as a class leader for world-first technology to be the best phone around. 
The phone’s screen is sharp, smooth and of excellent quality; its ceramic design feels super-premium; there are Harman/Kardon tuned speakers at the top and bottom; and it charges at a staggering 67W – wired and wireless with a compatible charger.
There’s no doubt about it, the Mi 11 Ultra is an exciting smartphone – but following a month of life with the device, does the reality live up to the spec sheet?
Design and screen
Premium but chunky ceramic bodyFour-sided curved glass displayWQHD+, 120Hz AMOLED technology
At 6ft 4in, I’m a tall guy with huge hands, and even I made an ‘ooof’ sound when handling the Mi 11 Ultra for the first time. 
It’s 234g, making it one of the heaviest phones around – the oversized iPhone 12 Pro Max weighs 228g, and when you account for its camera bump, it’s one chunky slab of a smartphone. Size aside, and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra does feel fantastically premium. It’s also unique in its heft and shape – no something many smartphones can really claim. 
At the base of the Mi 11 Ultra is a dual-SIM slot and a USB-C port. Disappointingly for a phone of the Mi 11 Ultra’s price, video-out from the USB-C port isn’t supported. Meanwhile, phones such as the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 feature full desktop UIs when hooked up to an external display, while the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro project their mobile interfaces at the very least.

The right side of the Mi 11 Ultra is where you’ll find power and volume buttons. At the top is an IR blaster for TV channel changing, while around the back is that hefty bump and curved ceramic goodness. 
The front and back sandwich a buffed metal frame, and the phone (available in Black or White) is IP68 water- and dust-resistant. It also comes with a case; something Apple and Samsung don’t include. 
The Mi 11 Ultra’s build quality (and size) extends to the front display, with its quad-curved WQHD+ panel clocking in at 6.81 inches. The AMOLED screen features a 3200 x 1440 resolution, which is super-sharp, resulting in an iPhone-bettering 515 pixels-per-inch. With a 20:9 aspect ratio, the phone isn’t quite the tallest around, but it isn’t too far off – and in turn, between its width and height, small hands may have trouble navigating it. 
The pure display quality of the Mi 11 Ultra’s screen is also fantastic when set aside the competition. It features a 5,000,000:1 contrast ratio, with HDR 10+ support and a peak brightness of 1700 nits. The tonal depth covered by the display makes it one of the best on the market in real life, and the in-hand feel of the Huawei P40 Pro-like four-sided curve screams premium as your fingers swipe across its responsive, zingy pixels.
The 120Hz display is great
With a 120Hz refresh rate, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s screen is as smooth as the competition, although one thing it isn’t is quite as optimized for battery-saving, with a higher minimum refresh rate than phones such as the Oppo Find X3 Pro or S21 Ultra. I don’t know if this is the reason I occasionally struggled to make it through a day with the phone – more on that later.
Where the Mi 11 Ultra does compete is colour accuracy, with a JNCD of 0.4 (the lower the number the better), and 10-bit (also referred to as billion colour) display tech. Protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, it’s packing top-tier protection, too.
Camera
50-megapixel wide-angle camera is the main sensor and it’s huge48-megapixel ultra-wide camera for variety 48-megapixel periscope camera for zooming
The big deal about this big phone is its main camera. The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra features a 1 /1.12-inch sensor size, which isn’t much smaller than the one-inch sensors on premium compact cameras such as the Sony RX100. 
The bigger the camera sensor, the better chance it has of grabbing light and capturing the best possible picture. This instantly puts the Mi 11 Ultra at an advantage when compared to smaller camera sensors on some of the best camera phones around. 
The camera bump is the biggest we’ve seen
With its 50-megapixel resolution, the primary camera on the Mi 11 Ultra packs plenty of pixels, but doesn’t shoot full-res shots by default. 
It takes 12.5-megapixel photos with four-in-one pixel combining. The phone’s lens sports an f/1.95 aperture, optical image stabilisation (OIS) and eight elements. 
Photos from the main camera are totally tanked up with depth when a subject is less than half a metre away. Background blur makes for rich, high-impact photos, be it a person or a succulent. Despite shallow depth and striking bokeh, however, where the Mi 11 Ultra’s main camera drops the ball is usable detail. If the tap-to-focus misses the mark just a touch, the Mi 11 Ultra’s shots aren’t as crisp as those taken on significantly lower-cost, older-generation 48-megapixel camera phones such as the 48-megapixel Poco F3, owing to the limited focus depth. 
In other words, the Mi 11 Ultra has idiosyncrasies, so to get the most out of it, you really need to understand how it works. 
The phone’s nuanced camera story extends to the 48-megapixel telephoto camera. Doubling up as a macro camera when capturing subjects from roughly one metre away (or more), it’s one of the more versatile ‘zoom’ modules available. While Xiaomi claims it packs a 120 times digital zoom and a 10 times hybrid zoom, its optical zoom range is five times, putting it on par with the Huawei Mate 40 Pro. The zoom module packs OIS, a half-inch sensor size and an f4.1 aperture.


While not quite as stellar at picking up far away detail as the Huawei P40 Pro Plus or S21 Ultra in my experience, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is still a formidable camera system for going wide and far without compromising on detail. 
The telephoto camera comes into its own in bright environments and when Night mode is engaged. Its shots also benefit from more neutral colour balance than the punchy main camera. Having said that, colour consistency across the three modules could be better.
The wide camera
…and then the ultra-wide
When it comes to the 48-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, this might be our favourite module on the Mi 11 Ultra. It sports autofocus, which not many ultra-wide cameras feature, and its 128-degree field of view lens is matched with a wide f/2.2 aperture. Most impressive is that it’s also able to capture macro photos, giving you three cameras with which to shoot close-up objects, each with its own characteristics. 
Even with distortion correction applied, the Mi 11 Ultra’s ultra-wide sports a fair amount of barrel distortion, given just how wide its angle of view. That said, with all the detail it captures and its 48-megapixel resolution, you can happily crop into photos taken on the ultra-wide camera, zapping peripheral distortion and making for a more realistic shot. Alternatively, put it in Photoshop or Lightroom, and it can be adjusted. With its almost GoPro aesthetic, I enjoyed the creative ops slightly distorted, super-wide photos delivered, but they won’t be for everyone.
If you’re getting a sense the Mi 11 Ultra’s camera is one for enthusiasts more than amateurs, you’re on the money. Folks who just want to point, shoot, and be guaranteed a reliable shot would be better off with an iPhone 12 Pro Max or a Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. That said, if you’re keen to master your camera phone’s quirks, the Mi 11 Ultra can – in the hands of a trained photographer – capture truly world-class shots. 
The phone also shoots up to 8K resolution video across all three of its rear cameras, and in bright environments the footage it captures looks great, with stabilisation working a treat across all resolutions. When the lights drop, the main and ultra-wide camera are the best to lean on for video. The phone also features a 20-megapixel front camera for selfies, which is a mighty flattering module with software-enhanced beauty features that range from naturally enhancing to totally over-the-top – the choice is yours.
Performance
Flagship power great for 3D gamesPlenty of storage, but no SD card slotBecomes hot with certain intense games and benchmarks
With a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset matched with up to 12GB of RAM, you won’t be seeing slowdown on the Mi 11 Ultra – although that doesn’t mean its user experience is flawless. 
Day-to-day, my first impression of the phone’s power was great thanks to its nippy performance matched with a smooth screen and a good-looking interface. It all runs on Android 11, with Xiaomi’s familiar MIUI 12 over the top – and, unlike Huawei, Xiaomi phones don’t have Google limitations, so you can access all the apps you need. 
While the interface looks good, and runs much better than it did on older Xiaomi phones with less frustrating adverts and blocks to your smartphone flow, it still serves up some UI gremlins. 
When the phone’s dark mode is activated, some of my Twitter contacts’ profile photos were inverted. Interactive notifications for apps such as Spotify also appear with invisible buttons. This is a danger of heavily redrawn user interfaces over Android – and of the main Android phone makers (including Huawei, Motorola, OnePlus, Oppo, Samsung and Sony), Xiaomi’s UI has the most gremlins.

Not surprisingly, the phone benchmarked well, scoring 1126 (single-core) and 3655 (multi-core) on GeekBench 5. Meanwhile, when faced with Wild Life on 3DMark, it scored 5594, placing it at the upper echelon of flagship smartphones – although not quite at the top of the pile, with the iPhone 12 Pro and Asus ROG Phone 5 bettering it. 
The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra also heated up quite a bit when running intensive benchmarks and high-octane games such as Genshin Impact. Given the phone will likely attract power-hungry gamers with its maxed-out specs, the fact you might need to run top-tier titles at anything less than maxed-out graphics settings will be a bitter pill to swallow, especially with the £1199 price tag.
What the Mi 11 Ultra does do really well is play back videos. Its expansive screen was a treat when showing off episode after episode of HDR show on Amazon Prime Video or Netflix, and the Harman/Kardon-tuned speakers are loud and broad.

Battery life
Big battery can struggle to get through the day with heavy useWireless and wired charging are super-fast
The Mi 11 Ultra didn’t make it through a full day on a single charge with moderate to heavy use. 
My full day looks like a 6am start and a 10pm stop, complete with lots of photo taking, Instagram scrolling, Spotify listening and some Netflix or YouTube watching. You could make it work if you’re more restrained, but my Mi 11 Ultra time benefitted greatly from a wireless charger at the office.
Watching an hour of Netflix used up around 7% battery with the screen at 60% brightness. Ramp up to full brightness, and that battery drain climbs to 10%.
In a turn for the books, the Mi 11 Ultra’s fast wired charging is as fast as its wireless charging – both 66W. With that in mind, the phone only ships with the wall charger and cable, so you’ll have to buy the Xiaomi-compatible charger to take advantage of those top speeds. I didn’t have one to test the wireless speeds, but I did have a wired charger, and the phone powered up to full in around 37 minutes. While not the fastest phone to get to 100%, it’s the fastest to do so with a 5000mAh battery.
There’s a USB C port for wired charging
The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is one of those phones that isn’t easy to recommend for most people, but it’s a lot of fun to use if you consider yourself a massive geek. 
The handset’s second screen alongside the camera is too small to be really practical when taking selfies – it’s more useful to give people you’re photographing a view of themselves. Gaming also falls behind some lower-cost smartphones thanks to the fact that demanding titles at max settings heat up the phone. Then there’s that battery life – it’s only ever fine. 
What the Mi 11 Ultra does do is take stellar pictures when you get to grips with its camera quirks. It also looks fantastic when playing back video on its bright, punchy screen, plus it sounds excellent and performs smoothly day-in-day-out.

You want a safe bet The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is a complex phone with a number of quirks. It also becomes hot when gaming for a long time at max graphics settings. Anyone after a simple life would be better off with a Galaxy S21 Ultra or an iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max.









Verdict
Ultimately, when the price drops – or if you find it on a great contract price – the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra could be a novel alternative to the Apples and Samsungs, with its high-impact camera and premium design and features. Those after a safer bet, however, will be well served by an S21 Ultra, or a lower-cost flagship such as the OnePlus 9 Pro.

Introduction
If you thought Xiaomi was finished with its sprawling 2021 Mi 11 line, you’d be sorely mistaken. Scan over the pricing of the existing range, and you’ll notice there’s a gap right in between the flagship Xiaomi Mi 11 and the mid-range Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite, which is what the Xiaomi Mi 11i seeks to fill.
Priced at €649 (roughly £560/$795) for the entry 128GB model and moving up to €699 (£605/$850) for the 256GB version, it notably undercuts the OnePlus 9. 
If you’re wondering why we’re not supplying official UK or US pricing, it’s because the Mi 11i isn’t bound for either of these English-speaking territories, at least not right now.
Although unsurprising, this limited rollout is a bit of a shame, since this really could be one of the best mid-range phones around. 
Design and screen
Identical design to the Poco F3 and Redmi K40 Pro+Slim, balanced plastic and glass buildStrong 6.67-inch 120Hz Super AMOLED screen
If the Xiaomi Mi 11i doesn’t quite look like the rest of the Xiaomi Mi 11 range, that’s because it isn’t from the same stock. To all intents and purposes, it’s a rebadged Redmi K40 Pro+.
You might not be familiar with that phone, which was primarily aimed at the Indian market. But you might well be familiar with the Poco F3, which shares the exact same external design. And I do mean the exact same – I have the two phones in front of me as I type this, and literally the only difference is the branding and some of the writing on the camera module.
Not surprisingly, the Xiaomi Mi 11i’s dimensions are identical to those of its doppelgangers (triplegangers?) – 163.7 x 76.4 and a super-skinny 7.8mm. It also weighs the same 196g, which is within that ‘just-right’ region right before things get uncomfortable.

Whether you call this approach cynical repurposing or efficient recycling (I find myself veering towards the former), it undoubtedly sits at odds with the aesthetically distinct, elegant design language of the wider Mi 11 range. I’d argue that the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite looks better and feels more special, despite costing a lot less.
If that assertion seems questionable to you, then consider that the Mi 11i’s twin, the Poco F3, costs only £329/€349 (no US pricing). In other words, it’s questionable whether you’re getting a premium design here.
That’s apparent from a number of little design compromises, most obviously the use of a plastic frame. While that frame might be sandwiched by Gorilla Glass 5, the display itself is dead flat. And while the bezels are fairly minimal, the chin is a little larger. Glance up to the central hole-punch selfie camera, meanwhile, and you’ll see that distractingly reflective surround that some cheaper phones tend to have.
Another sign that the Xiaomi Mi 11i is made of relatively humble stuff is a deeply modest IP53 rating. You won’t want to be dropping it in any pools of water, that’s for sure. It’s a shame there’s no IP68 rating here, for that extra protection.
The fingerprint sensor is on the side of the plastic body
Another budget-level touch is the inclusion of a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, something often seen on the best cheap phones but rarely on much pricier devices. It’s nice and reliable, and it unlocks the phone in an instant – but like the Poco F3, it lacks the extra texture or indentation to help you find it in a pinch.
Finally, the Mi 11i’s haptic motor clearly isn’t in the same league as that of, say, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra. But then, that phone costs twice the money.
All negativity aside, the Xiaomi Mi 11i is a perfectly pleasant phone to use. It’s robust and comfortable, and it also finds space for stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support, which is apparently a first for Xiaomi smartphones.
On the display front you’re looking at a 6.67-inch Super AMOLED with an FHD+ resolution and a nice fast 120Hz refresh rate. There’s HDR10+ support  for more immersive and colourful video in supported apps and services.
Another small area in which the Mi 11i trumps the OnePlus 9 is the matter of touch sampling rate. At 360Hz, this display is as responsive to the touch as the OnePlus 9 Pro. That’s good news for gamers, especially when combined with the phone’s impressive performance.
Camera
108MP main sensor of a lesser order than Mi 11’sCapable of decent, if not flagship-level shotsUnderwhelming ultra-wide, especially compared to OnePlus 9
In case you hadn’t picked up on it yet, we have the sense that the Xiaomi Mi 11i is a bit of a parts bin job – albeit a very accomplished one. That feeling continues when we consider its camera system.

It’s headlined by a very impressive sounding 108-megapixel wide sensor, but this isn’t the same state-of-the-art Samsung ISOCELL HM3 component that so impressed us in the Xiaomi Mi 11 and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Instead, it’s the much more humble Samsung ISOCELL HM2 sensor that we’ve previously seen in the Redmi Note 10 Pro and the Realme 8 Pro.
We were very impressed with the camera systems of both of those latter two phones. But context is crucial, and both cost a lot less. While we praised their photographic output for punching well above their weight, those same (or very similar) results feel more like par for the course in a phone retailing for double the money.
Still, par translates to pretty good pictures at this end of the market. Shots taken with the Xiaomi Mi 11i’s main camera are generally bright, detailed and nicely balanced. Xiaomi’s AI constructs zingy, colourful shots that nonetheless never get to Samsung levels of extreme vibrancy.
In daylight pictures look good, with bright colours and nice balance
There’s a good whack of detail, too
I noticed an unexpected amount of lens flare when shooting side-on to the sun, which was a bit of an unpleasant surprise. You don’t get the benefits of a fancy Zeiss lens coating as you do with the Vivo X60 Pro. 

But generally speaking, the results are decent. Food shots looked good enough to eat, while the Portrait mode proved pretty effective at isolating subject from blurred-out background.
Night mode shots look passable, but there’s a clear gulf between this and more expensive phones. Besides the more modest sensor, you can probably thank the lack of OIS for that. The OnePlus 9 also lacks this fundamental component, so the Xiaomi Mi 11i isn’t alone here, but it’s worthy of criticism in both cases.
Night mode is passable
The Mi 11i’s 8-megapixel ultra-wide sensor is really nothing to write home about, and certainly isn’t up to the standard of the OnePlus 9’s uniquely capable 50-megapixel equivalent or some of the other best camera phones around. Shots taken with this zoomed-out sensor are far from a write-off, but the colour tone is more exaggerated than with the main sensor, and detail levels are clearly inferior.
The ultra-wide camera
There’s also a 5-megapixel macro sensor, but you can probably guess what we think about that. It will capture extreme close-ups reasonably proficiently, but with noticeable levels of noise. For zoomed-in shots you’ll have to rely on Xiaomi cropping in on the main sensor. Thankfully, it has pixels to burn, so they don’t look bad at all.
Indeed, that eyebrow-raising 108-megapixel figure actually equates to 12-megapixel shots in general shooting, thanks to a 9-to-1 pixel-binning technique. While the pixels come in at a fairly modest size of 0.7μm on their own, they combine to produce 2.1μm ‘super pixels’.
The Mi 11i’s 20-megapixel selfie camera is adequate, if underwhelming. Skin tones tend to feel a little smudged and rubbery in my experience, but it does a basic job.
The selfie camera is adequate
Performance
Snapdragon 888 and 8GB of RAM for flagship performanceTogether with 360Hz touch sampling rate, it’s great for gamingMIUI still fast and functional, but still a compromise
Xiaomi calls the Mi 11i “The Star Performer,” and it isn’t hard to see why.
With a Snapdragon 888 chip and 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM, it’s as well specced as any Android phone on the market. 
Both Genshin Impact and PUBG Mobile operate impeccably at full graphical settings, as you’d expect of any phone with this level of power. Like the OnePlus 9 before it, the Mi 11i really is offering you top-end performance for a good price.
My benchmark tests only confirmed that point.
In Geekbench 5, an average multi-core score of 3721 and a single-core score of 1130 is right up there with the very best. The far pricier Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra, for example, scored 3731 and 1117 respectively.
Unfortunately, I was unable to put the Mi 11i through any of the usual 3DMark and GFXBench GPU tests, since Xiaomi appears to be blocking any that require an online connection. But the eyes and fingers don’t lie, and the Mi 11i made short work of the usual high-end gaming workouts.

The Xiaomi Mi 11i goes one better in gaming performance terms. The OnePlus 9’s display ‘only’ manages a 240Hz touch sampling rate, while the Xiaomi Mi 11i matches the OnePlus 9 Pro on 360Hz. In other words, its display is super-responsive to touch inputs, which has particular ramifications for games that require fast reactions.
Such advanced games tend to take up a lot of space on your phone, of course, but the Xiaomi Mi 11i is well equipped for the task. There’s a choice of either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage, albeit with no potential for expansion.
This being a Xiaomi phone, you have to deal with the company’s MIUI 12 layered over Android 11. I’ve been using this interface an awful lot over recent months, across a diverse range of phones including the Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite, the Poco F3, the Redmi Note 10 Pro, and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra.
Perhaps this familiarity has forced a sense of comfort with Xiaomi’s UI, as I find it quite easy to live with. It’s fast and fluid, Google Feed is right there to the left of the homescreen, and there’s a pleasing level of customisation on offer. The ability to split the notifications and control centre into two separate drag-down motions is a particularly welcome touch.
Despite this growing comfort, though, I’ve still not come to truly love MIUI. This remains a somewhat fussy and overly in-your-face interface – the kind that makes you wait a few seconds to reflect on certain system-affecting decisions before you can confirm them.
You also get the usual suite of Xiaomi’s own apps, alongside a smattering of preinstalled third-party apps. What, you didn’t want TikTok or WPS Office on your phone? Tough luck. I’ve grown accustomed to instantly shunting a dozen or more of these apps into a ‘junk’ folder, but I’d really rather not have to do that.
Battery life
4520mAh battery sufficient for all day use33W is quick enough, if not the quickestNo wireless charging
The Xiaomi Mi 11i runs off a 4520mAh battery, which is a pretty normal flagship spec. It’s roughly the same capacity as the OnePlus 9, with which it’s in close competition.
It’s unsurprising to find that the Mi 11i enjoys a broadly similar level of stamina, then. Just as with the second-tier OnePlus, you’ll be able to get through a full day of fairly intensive use on a single charge. 
I found that I was routinely able to go get to bed time with 20-30% left in the tank. This was with three and a half to four hours of screen-on time, and with fairly mixed usage – including a little gaming and plenty of time spent away from the stability of a Wi-Fi connection.
What’s more interesting is the finding that the Mi 11i enjoyed superior battery performance to the more capacious (4600mAh) Xiaomi Mi 11. While the latter supped up 12% of its charge following an hour of Netflix streaming, the Mi 11i only consumed 7%. 
You can likely thank the Mi 11’s more hungry 1440p display resolution for that. Sure enough, the similarly specced OnePlus 9 consumed a similar amount during our media tests.
Where the OnePlus 9 really scores big over its rival is in recharge time. You only get a 33W charger bundled in with the Xiaomi Mi 11i, whereas the OnePlus 9 provides a huge 65W brick. 
Charge times for the Xiaomi Mi 11i are still reasonably rapid. I was able to get from 0 to 72% in just 30 minutes, which is nothing to be sniffed at. But when you consider that the OnePlus 9 can do the same in less than 15 minutes, it’s clear where the advantage lies.
While we’re giving props to OnePlus, its affordable flagship also supports wireless charging. There’s no such provision for the Xiaomi Mi 11i, which is a bit of a downer. It’s another sign that this isn’t the custom-made premium phone it might appear to be.

Should you buy it?


You want a flagship experience for less The Mi 11i comes with plenty of flagship specs and features, but for a lower price. If high performance is important then this remains a great option.


You’re on the hunt for good design The Xiaomi Mi 11i approaches the mainline Mi 11 with many of its specs, but its design falls well short. It’s way more generic than even the lesser Xiaomi Mi 11 Lite.









Verdict
The Xiaomi Mi 11i offers a compelling alternative to the OnePlus 9, with competitive flagship-level performance, a vibrant and fluid display, and a 108-megapixel camera, all for a little less money. It seems to have been cobbled together from bits of other phones, however, which gives it a somewhat generic feel, while its 108-megapixel camera isn’t quite as advanced as it first seems. It’s a distant and altogether less beguiling cousin to the rest of the Mi 11 family, but it certainly has its talents.

Verdict




























 



There are lingering question marks over its price and availability so I won't be scoring the Vivo X60 Pro yet, but as it stands this is a unique upper-mid-range/entry-flagship phone with a remarkably stable camera, a highly desirable design and solid performance. It isn't the best-specced phone in its class, however, and for all its camera charms it doesn’t take the best photos. As a value proposition, we suspect it’s going to struggle against the altogether more capable OnePlus 9. But for those looking for something a little different in a rather samey field, it’s a sleek and stylish alternative.



Pros

Super steady gimbal shots
Sleek design
Good telephoto camera



Cons

Both day and night time shots can look overblown
No wireless charging

4300mAh battery
33w charging


Less than a year on from the Vivo X50 Pro, has Vivo managed to add power and value to its classy, camera-focused upper-mid-range concept with the Vivo X60 Pro?
The Vivo X50 Pro certainly wasn’t lacking for bold ideas, particularly when it came to its novel gimbal-enhanced camera.
But we had one or two concerns over its viability in a particularly competitive area of the market. There are so many best mid-range phone options around now that it can be hard to stand out. Can The X60 Pro hold its own in such a formidable field?
Design and Screen

Slender design with beautiful satin finish
One or two disappointing ‘affordable’ concessions
Big, bright, 120Hz AMOLED

I described last year’s Vivo X50 Pro as “a strikingly pretty phone”, and the Vivo X60 Pro is equally handsome.
It would have been nice to see Vivo advance its design ideas a tad further, in fact. If it weren’t for a few minor details, you might assume they were the same phone. Nevertheless, it’s a lovely piece of kit to have sat on your coffee table.
The X60 Pro is a couple of grams lighter than its predecessor – at 179g, it hits that same sweet spot of a phone that feels premium without weighing you down. It’s a mere slip of a thing at 7.6mm thick, too.
It has the same combination of aluminium body and twin-glass surfaces as seen in previous devices, and those surfaces are also shaped the same. Both front and rear expanses of glass curve off at the edges, the side rails are thin and slightly rounded, and the top and bottom edges flatten out. The top edge even has its own smooth panel, with ‘Professional Photography’ etched onto it.

The rear of the phone has that same silky, pearlescent yet matte, finish that wowed us before. Our test model comes in a colour I’d be tempted to call “technicolor dreamcoat”, but which Vivo rather undersells as “Shimmer Blue”. It seems to shift through all of the colours of the rainbow, depending on the angle from which you view it.
Another telltale differentiation is a slightly thicker camera module, which still looks suitably ‘Pro’. More so, in fact, with the addition of Zeiss branding. But we’ll dive into the particulars of that in the following section.
A more obvious departure from last year’s model is in the shift to a centrally mounted selfie camera, similar to Samsung. Which is preferable will be down to personal choice.
There are a couple of points that indicate to the discerning user that this isn’t quite a flagship phone. For one thing, the bottom bezel is ever so slightly thicker than the top bezel. It’s a tiny bit disappointing given the phone’s Pro posturing, but it’s a fairly subtle imbalance all the same.
While we’re on the topic of a slightly less-than-premium build, it’s a shame to see that Vivo hasn’t included an IP rating of any kind. A decent, officially sanctioned level of waterproofing is something we’d really like to see as standard in the £/$/€700+ category.
Another slight letdown is the use of a single bottom-mounted speaker. The OnePlus 9 offers decent stereo speakers for less.
One thing that doesn’t disappoint is the Vivo X60 Pro’s display. Like its predecessor, it’s a 6.56-inch FHD+ AMOLED, which outputs a bright, vibrant picture.
This time, however, Vivo has cranked up the refresh rate from 90Hz to a full 120Hz. That’s a proper flagship spec, and it competes well with the OnePlus 9 and the Samsung Galaxy S21 for fluidity when set to the full 120Hz.

By default this refresh rate is set to Smart Switch, which goes with “the most appropriate screen refresh rate… according to the actual usage scenario”. This isn’t a fully adaptable LPTO display (as you’ll find in the OnePlus 9 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra), but rather switches between the available 60Hz and 120Hz options to help conserve power.
Camera

Gimbal offers impressive steadiness, especially with video
Three consistent sensors, but colours a little OTT
Telephoto does a good job

Like its predecessor, the Vivo X60 Pro’s headline feature is its 48-megapixel gimbal-assisted wide camera. This time, however, you get a slightly wider f/1.5 aperture, which is unusually large for a smartphone.

Vivo has also stepped up its game with a new Zeiss partnership in an effort to compete with the best camera phones. The German brand is a respected name in high-end optics, although it hasn’t exactly been shy about putting its name to smartphones in the past, most notably the Nokia X20 and the Sony Xperia 1 III.
While terms such as “Zeiss Imaging quality” and “the famous Zeiss look” might seem a little vague, there are two specific benefits to this co-engineering partnership. One is access to Zeiss’s T* optical coating, which cuts down on reflections and other visual distortions. The other is a Portrait mode that simulates Zeiss’s Biotar lens design for a more pronounced bokeh effect.

However, the real point of interest here is a second-generation double-ball suspension mount for its main camera, and that’s all Vivo. This system steadies shots to a far greater degree than your average OIS system, physically moving the sensor in the opposite direction along five axes whenever movement is detected.
Using the X60 Pro camera feels reassuringly solid. There’s still a slight sense of wallowiness when you shift the viewfinder, but it isn’t too pronounced this time around, and you grow accustomed to the dampened effect.
The benefits are particularly noticeable when you shoot video in ‘Super anti-shake’ mode, where even breaking into a slow jog didn’t seem to disturb my footage all that much. It felt spookily still at times, although you will have to put up with a cropped picture in this ramped up mode. You won’t be able to capture at any higher than 1080p in either this or Standard stabilisation mode.
This gimbal system alone arguably justifies the ‘Professional Photography’ boast scrawled on the top of the X60 Pro. Gimbal systems are indeed something the pros use, and are a rare provision in any smartphone. But it doesn’t quite make the Vivo X60 Pro a top-level contender when it comes to general shooting.
I took the Vivo X60 Pro out for a day’s shooting with the OnePlus 9 and the OnePlus 9 Pro, and the comparison proved instructive. The X60 Pro will likely fall in between those two phones on pricing, and OnePlus (a sister brand to Vivo) is another manufacturer that’s recently attached itself to a camera industry legend (this time Hasselblad) in a bid for photographic legitimacy.

It was immediately evident that the X60 Pro punches up colours way more than both the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro, giving shots an excessively bright, slightly artificial look. On a sunny spring day, it tended to top the OnePlus 9 for detail and displayed a little less sharpening than the OnePlus 9 Pro.


One particular shot of some yellow tulips displayed less noise on the Vivo than the OnePlus phones, but a corresponding lack of detail, like everything had been smoothed out more aggressively. On another occasion, Zeiss’s T* optical coating came into play when shooting into the sun. Where the OnePlus phones suffered from distracting lens flare effects, the Vivo had none.
After impressing with the X50 Pro, Vivo’s gimbal-driven Night mode (which enables long, shake-free shutter times) has rather fallen behind the pack. Low-light snaps are certainly much brighter on the X60 Pro than the OnePlus 9, the OnePlus 9 Pro, the iPhone 12 mini, and the Oppo Find X3 Pro. But there’s also an uncanny, overblown look to them, and I far preferred the more sophisticated and natural looks of all of the above rivals.


Both the Vivo’s 13-megapixel ultra-wide sensor and its dedicated 13-megapixel telephoto match the tone of the main sensor nicely – which is to say that they punch up those greens and blues to a roughly equal degree. I was quite impressed with the telephoto, which captured more detail and exhibited less purple fringing than either of the OnePlus equivalents. It’s a shame to see the dedicated periscope lens missing from the X50 Pro, though.

Those aforementioned Zeiss-enhanced Portrait shots can look great, with some lovely impressionistic bokeh. But it isn’t a true optical effect, and you’ll still lose some of the edge of your subject to blur and weird artifacts.
All in all, you’re going to get more natural-looking results if you go with the OnePlus 9 or iPhone 12 ranges, and you’ll get a better night-shooting experience, too. But the general quality and consistency of the X60 Pro’s triple-camera system is laudable.
If you like your shots to be super-bright and punchy, you lean on the telephoto lens a lot, or your videos have the tendency to descend into vomit-inducing shakiness, then the Vivo X60 Pro could be a great camera system for you.
Performance

Snapdragon 870 offers flagship-esque performance
Performance is good, but you can get better for the money
FunTouch is still gaudy and bloated

Vivo has stepped up its performance game a little with the X60 Pro. While the Vivo X50 Pro generally felt fast enough most of the time, the Vivo X60 Pro genuinely is fast enough all of the time.
Its Snapdragon 870 chip is a capable performer, and a big improvement over the Snapdragon 765 that powered the Vivo X50 Pro. But it isn’t quite at the level of the Snapdragon 888 found in the best phones like the OnePlus 9, nor of the Exynos 2100 that powers the Samsung Galaxy S21.
This is essentially a souped-up version of the Snapdragon 865 that ran most of last year’s flagship phones. The raw gains made from upping the clock rate are actually quite impressive, but it can’t match the graphical output of newer chips.
In terms of raw CPU performance, an average Geekbench 5 multicore score of 3425 places the Vivo X60 Pro only slightly below the OnePlus 9 (3614) and the Samsung Galaxy S21 (3523). That tallies with my general experience of using the phone, with everything feeling fast, fluid and stutter-free – doubtless aided by a generous 12GB of RAM.
The gap is more pronounced when you test the GPU side of things, however. A 3DMark: Wildlife score of 4237 falls significantly behind the OnePlus 9 (5740) and the Samsung Galaxy S21 (5701), suggesting that the ageing chip can’t push advanced graphics as fluidly as its more up-to-date competitors.

Not that most people are likely to notice, even in demanding applications. Cranking PUBG Mobile up to HDR Graphics and Extreme Frame Rate (the highest any FHD+ Android phone will go) yielded a very playable experience. I played it back-to-back with the OnePlus 9 on the same settings, and while the latter was perhaps a little more fluid, the gap wasn’t huge. Ditto with popular MOBA Wild Rift. With the graphical settings cranked up to the max, the OnePlus hit a fractionally higher frame rate, but the Vivo didn’t feel too far off.
Meanwhile, 256GB is a generous amount of storage to go with – it’s another classy touch from Vivo.
Unfortunately, a little of the X60 Pro’s classy sheen is rubbed off by the abrasive effect of FunTouch 11 – Vivo’s custom Android 11 UI. As before, it’s a slightly gaudy take on Google’s OS.
It’s full of overly fussy elements, such as a screen complaining that your perfectly legitimate app downloads aren’t ‘Vivo certified’, and suggesting that you ‘Reinstall safe version in V-Appstore’. As if downloading Disney+ through the Google Play Store is in some way dicing with death.
The second homescreen, meanwhile, offers a headache-inducing array of 20-odd app icons, only some of which are useful or even appropriate to a Western audience. I should note that the Vivo X51 tidied up some of these extraneous elements, so hopefully an official Western successor will follow suit.
I’m glad that Google Feed is situated to the left of the homescreen, too. Elsewhere, Vivo seems to have leaned towards its OnePlus stablemate’s Oxygen OS with some of its new design flourishes: a stylishly enlarged header font here, a thinned-out brightness slider there. But it doesn’t quite go far enough.
Battery Life

The phone will comfortably survive a full day of moderate use
33W charging is decent, but not the fastest for the money
Lack of wireless charging is a bit of a downer

I approached the Vivo X60 Pro’s battery credentials with a little trepidation. At 4200mAh, it’s smaller than the 4500mAh cell in the OnePlus 9.
Perhaps more worryingly, it’s smaller than the 4315mAh battery in the Vivo X50 Pro, despite including a more demanding 120Hz display. That would seem to be a recipe for inferior stamina, all things said.
Despite my misgivings, the Vivo X60 Pro holds its own. Whether in the Smart Switch screen refresh rate setting – which changes between 120Hz and 60Hz as the activity dictates – or a locked 120Hz, I found that around five hours of screen-on time would drain the battery to 20%. That means it’s good for a day of moderate to heavy use without too much sweat.
It certainly isn’t a phone for power users or serious gamers, though. On a particularly intensive day of fixed 120Hz usage, which entailed a couple of games of Wild Rift, a game of PUBG Mobile, and a day out snapping 50 photos, I found myself down to 25% by 6pm – just eight hours after unplugging it.
When it does come time to recharge, you’ll get Vivo’s FlashCharge 2.0 brick in the box. It offers the same 33W fast charging as the X50 Pro, but what seemed quite speedy in mid-2020 feels quite run-of-the-mill in early 2021, with the OnePlus 9 and the Oppo Find X3 Neo laying on an impressive 65W equivalent. Nevertheless, it remains better than the Samsung Galaxy S21’s 25W and the iPhone 12’s 20W charging, and neither of those come free in the box.
One thing those two phones have, along with the OnePlus 9, is support for wireless charging. It feels like a bit of an omission here.
There are lingering question marks over its price and availability I won’t be scoring the Vivo X60 Pro yet, but as it stands this is a unique upper-mid-range/entry-flagship phone with a remarkably stable camera, a highly desirable design and solid performance.
You should buy the Vivo X60 Pro if…

You like your phones slim and stylish
Not every phone has to be a huge lump of blandness, as the Vivo X60 Pro’s sleek, suave design shows.


You want rock-steady shots and videos
Those whose snaps and videos typically devolve into a shaky mess will love the X60 Pro’s uncanny poise, courtesy of a unique gimbal system.


Telephoto shots still matter to you
It isn’t uncommon for mid-range phones to ditch the telephoto lens, but the X60 Pro keeps one around – and it’s pretty decent too.

You shouldn’t buy the Vivo X60 Pro if…

You’re a power-obsessed gamer
The Vivo X60 Pro isn’t power-deficient by any means, but it’s essentially running on 2020 tech. In particular, its GPU falls well behind the OnePlus 9 and the Galaxy S21.
You want a slick, tasteful UI
FunTouch is fully featured and highly customisable – but it’s also busy and bloated.
You want wireless charging
It’s quite possible to get a phone with wireless charging at this price – the OnePlus 9 and the iPhone 12 mini spring to mind – but the Vivo X60 Pro isn’t among them.

Introduction

Key Features




Battery life: The endurance here is good


Two sizes:The Venu 2 comes in 40mm and 45m sizes


Sensors:GPS, Compass, Blood oxygen and more


The Garmin Venu 2 is a higher-end running and fitness watch with more of a smartwatch flavour than other Garmin devices. 
It swaps the highly practical but quite dull-looking screens of the Fenix and Forerunner watches in favour of an OLED. You get more gloss and a touchscreen, rather than having to pilot the thing only with buttons. content
It’s a great watch for regular run tracking, the smartwatch basics, and has a very good heart rate sensor. However, some will still be better opting for the less glitzy Forerunner 745 instead. The Garmin Venu 2 doesn’t offer insights about training effect, recovery and training status.
I’ll look at what these actually mean in this review, but they’re handy if you want to use tech to see how your fitness progresses over the months. 
If you’re not in this stat-obsessed crowd but are still more interested in exercise tracking than smartwatch apps, I’d recommend the Garmin Venu 2 over an Apple Watch 6 or Samsung Galaxy Watch 3. The battery life alone makes it one of the best smartwatches around.

Design
Available in two sizes40mm or 45mm optionDoesn’t have bags of style
The Garmin Venu 2 range comes in two sizes. What you see here is the standard version. It isn’t huge, nor is it tiny. It has a 45mm diameter – and if that seems too big, just buy the Venu 2S instead, which is 40mm wide. Both devices are priced identically.
The pair look more-or-less like smartwatches – and more like cheaper units such as the OnePlus Watch or Amazfit GTR 2e than the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3.
I don’t think anyone should come to Garmin’s higher-end watches expecting bags of style. You won’t find it. But the Garmin Venu 2 is pleasant enough.

The top layer of the device is toughened glass, but not of the expensive Sapphire type. A ring of stainless still sits around the glass, only partially protecting the screen because its top lip sits just a fraction of a millimetre above the glass itself.
It’s clear here that Garmin’s intentions with the Venu 2 have been to make a ‘lifestyle’ watch, not a chunky, ultra-rugged device.
The Venu 2’s underside is plastic and the strap a functional-not-fancy silicone. A bunch of Chinese companies such as Huawei, Honor, Amazfit and Oppo pump out watches of similar contraction at around a third of the price. Again, you don’t buy a Garmin for style. You buy it for what it can do.
I like the Venu 2 for all-day wear far more than the Garmin Fenix 6 Solar. It feels far less weightier on your wrist as you run, and it’s just about light and petite enough to wear for sleep tracking without a sense you’re turning into a Mark Zuckerberg-adjacent tech acolyte.
Screen and battery life
OLED display416 x 416, 1.3-inch screenAlways on mode
An OLED screen defines the Venu 2’s place in the wider Garmin range. The majority of Garmin watches have a transflective screen, one that becomes brighter and clearer the more ambient light there is.
This is perfect for exercise outdoors, and ‘stays on’ 24/7 while using very little battery power. However, such screens are relatively low-resolution and their colour and contrast aren’t very strong. The Venu 2’s OLED offers far greater image pop, bringing the same sort of gloss you get with an Apple Watch.
The 45mm Venu 2 I have features a 416 x 416-pixel, 1.3-inch screen. Compare that to the 240 x 240-pixel Forerunner 745 and you start to see the appeal. The Venu 2 screen looks shaper, which does wonders for the stacks of graphs you can view on the watch itself. More on that later.

As standard, the Venu 2 screen doesn’t stay on all the time. You simply whip the watch around to your face to make it light up, as is the case with most other OLED watches.
However, dig around in the Settings menu and you’ll find options to keep the screen lit during exercise, and all day long. Obviously, this impacts battery life, and Garmin also warns the ‘always on’ mode may affect the lifespan of the screen. This likely refers to image retention and pixel degradation, notable OLED issues – but it’s too early to tell if Garmin is just being characteristically cautious. Always-on modes in OLED watches are very common, it probably is.
Keep the ‘always-on’ mode switched off and you’ll see battery life that comes close to Garmin’s claim of 11 days. Following six days the charge level had dropped from 100% to 38%. I hadn’t worn it 24/7, but I had used the Venu 2 for two hours of GPS tracking.
Checking the battery level before and after these tracked workouts, Garmin’s claim of 20-hour GPS battery life also seems sound. It loses 5-6% an hour.
The Venu 2 lasts far longer than the original Venu, which is rated at just five days. It has the same 20-hour GPS stamina, suggesting there’s significant power optimisation in the processor, software or display. Or all three.
Unfortunately, the full-on always-on display mode has a huge effect on longevity. It loses a couple of per cent charge each hour, draining a full charge in a couple of days. After 24 hours with the screen lit whenever worn, the Venu 2’s battery dropped from 61% to 16%. 
I love watches that display the time, all the time. I don’t love watches you need to charge every other day. And where I’d normally suggest using ‘always on’ where it halves battery life, the sacrifice is probably too great here.
Always-on during exercise? Yes. Always-on 24/7? No – consider keeping it off.

There are also three levels of brightness control available in Settings. However, I don’t think most will need to worry about these since the Venu 2 features an auto-brightness sensor that increases display power when you go outdoors, or into a brighter environment.
This is classic Garmin: if it can give you a customisation option, it will.
Health and fitness tracking
A focus on generalised health trackingPlenty of tracking optionsWorks with Garmin Connect app
It’s easy to start reeling off lists of features when talking about Garmin watches, but the character of this watch is fairly easy to explain. The Garmin Venu 2 is a little closer to the Fitbit Sense than most other Garmin devices.
There’s a greater focus on generalised health tracking than your fitness progress. It estimates how stressed you are, your breathing rate and your ‘body battery’ – a Garmin stat intended to look at how rundown you might be.
But you don’t see a performance indicator when you go for a run, something that pops-up mid-workout in Forerunner watches. Or your training load, which analyses how much you’ve exercised in the past week relative to your usual routine. Or any suggestions of how long you should rest after each session before taking on the next.

The Garmin Venu 2 hasn’t updated my VO2 Max score, either. There’s no sign of it on the watch anywhere, although it does support the stat. A little digging suggests that this is because the watch uses a new way to judge VO2 Max, relying on your ‘fitness age’, calculated using stats such as your BMI and resting heart rate, rather than your performance during exercise.
The message I get is the Venu 2 is tailored for people who exercise a bit less often, or at least less hard, than the average Garmin Fenix/Forerunner owner. That seems sensible, but as someone who uses a Garmin 90% for run tracking, I prefer the classic Garmin VO2 Max calculation. 
You see this lighter approach in the interface, too. The main interaction in the Garmin Venu 2, outside of tracked exercise, is the Glances screen. Flick up or down from the watch face and you’ll see a long list of tracker stats. 

You choose what goes in here, but the default is the following:
StepsFloors ClimbedIntensity Minutes (per week)CaloriesHydrationHeart RateBody BatteryStressRespiration (breathing rate)Pulse Ox (blood oxygenation)SleepActivities (recent workouts)This week (summary)ScheduleNotificationsWeatherHealth snapshot
Combine this array with the lack of nerdy performance metrics and you realise the Venu 2 is less of a flat-out runner/marathon/triathlon watch than other Garmins around the price.
You can dig pretty deep into these lighter areas of fitness tracking, mind. Tap on a ‘Glance’ stat and you’ll see a detailed scrollable graph of results from the past (roughly) 24 hours. And, in some cases, charts showing a history of results over the past week when you flick down to the next screen.

I think this sort of data is best looked at on the Garmin Connect app, but it displays Garmin’s nerdy love of stats, and browsing through it all feels responsive and natural enough on the small touchscreen. This watch doesn’t feel slow and doesn’t – unlike some longer-lasting OLED watches – use an obviously low display refresh rate to conserve battery.
A lack of hardcore performance metric doesn’t mean the Venu 2 is necessarily the wrong choice for those who run marathons. Its GPS accuracy is very good, and I see great results from the new heart rate sensor.
The Garmin Venu 2 has an Elevate v4 heart rate sensor. It uses two LEDs and four light sensors, up from two in the last-generation array.

I compared the Venu 2’s results with those of a heart rate chest strap during a run. The results were extremely similar. The peak recorded heart rate was at the same moment, with just a 1bpm difference in the recorded rate. Peaks and troughs mapped onto each other very well.
There was one anomaly. Before the workout started properly, the Venu 2’s reading dropped to around 65bpm when it should have been ~80bpm, despite recording a more accurate reading at the very start of tracking.
It’s important to remember the software is just as important as the hardware when it comes to heart rate tracking. For example, I had more issues with the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar than this back in 2020. It would usually report a too-high heart rate at the start of tracking, an issue that seems to have largely disappeared after subsequent software updates.
I think the Garmin Venu 2 is a great tracker for runners, as long as you don’t use stats such as training load and per-workout performance indicators to spur you on. 
However, bear in mind the Venu 2 lacks proper maps. This is no surprise.
The more fitness-forward Garmins around the price, such as the Instinct and Forerunner 745, don’t have proper mapping either. It’s an expensive feature in Garmin land.
Not convinced yet? Garmin goes far further than most with its on-watch workouts. These are available in several of the Venu 2’s 25 tracking modes, which range from walking to yoga and bouldering.
For example, choose a workout in yoga and you’ll see animated guides on the different poses. Strength training offers similar prompts.
Each of these workouts splits the sessions into blocks, a little like having a personal trainer who doesn’t shout at you.
Muscle maps are a new Venu 2 feature. You’ll see these before you start each strength-based workout. They show the muscle groups used.
A bunch of guided workouts are pre-loaded on the Venu 2, and you can add more through the Garmin Connect app on your phone. I rarely use them, but it’s a nice free feature, and you can create your own from scratch.
Sleep tracking
Good sleep tracking featuresOn par with Fitbit models we have reviewed
The Garmin Venu 2 has slightly more advanced sleep tracking on offer than other Garmin watches. Looking further into the results, it seems to be based on using indicators such as breathing rate, stress and Pulse Ox (blood oxygenation, tracked if enabled) to inform the results.
However, stress and breathing rate are both derived from heart rate variability. It’s Garmin dressing up stats that its other watches already harvest.

I don’t have a lot of faith in the accuracy of wrist-worn sleep trackers, but the Venu 2 seems solid enough, now roughly on a par with Fitbit’s sleep tracking style. 
It registered when I woke up briefly at 2am one night, and when I hit snooze on an alarm one morning and went back to sleep for an additional 20 minutes.
Smart features and apps
A limited selectionApps for Spotify, Amazon Music and DeezerSpace foe 650 songs
Music is another Garmin Venu 2 highlight. Its a standard feature across the Venu 2 and Venu 2S, and there are apps for Amazon Music, Spotify and Deezer.
The Spotify app lets you download playlists and browse ‘recently played’ albums if you’re not an organised Spotify-er, but you don’t get full browse access to the Spotify library. It would be a bit of a nightmare anyway, since the Venu 2 isn’t designed to let you type away on the screen itself.
You connect Bluetooth headphones to listen, and there’s space for around 650 songs on the watch, or a little over 6GB.
Not a streaming service fan? You can take the old-school approach by transferring tracks using Garmin Express on your Mac or Windows computer. Music controls are available during workouts, as you’d hope.

The Garmin Venu 2 is also the first watch to support Connect IQ 4.0, the latest version of Garmin’s app platform.
This effectively means developers can now create apps with graphics suited to the higher-resolution OLED displays of watches from the Venu series. It doesn’t mean you suddenly get access to a whole new world of software.
A browse through Connect IQ is much like doing so on any other higher-end Garmin watch. You can download lots of watch faces, stacks of data screens. But this isn’t like the Apple Watch library.
Useful features you can add are tools to find your car in the car park, Pomodoro work timers and alerts for intermittent fasting fans.
Don’t expect too much and you won’t be disappointed. That said, the Venu 2 does have much of what I use a smartwatch for. It offers wireless payment via Garmin Pay (check to see if your bank is supported), music playback and notifications.
You can receive your WhatsApp messages, or alerts from any app, on the Venu 2. And you can also send canned replies, which you compose beforehand in the Garmin Connect app.
Conclusion
I have loved using the Garmin Venu 2. I trust its stats, it’s fairly comfortable to wear 24/7, and the battery life is good as long as you don’t set the screen to stay on all day. Just don’t buy a Venu 2 expecting a high-end Forerunner watch with an OLED screen. While it records the usual dizzying array of metrics, some of the stats that can help you balance a packed workout schedule are left out.

Should you buy it?


You want a glossy GarminTake a mid-range Garmin runners’ watch, rip out the (to some) stale-looking transflective screen and add a bold OLED and you get the Garmin Venu 2, more or less. While I’m a fan of Garmin’s other display style, this one is sure sharper, bolder and more colourful.


You want to balance a stacked workout regimeThe Venu 2 lacks some of the metrics that the most ardent Garmin fans enjoy, such as training load, suggested recovery times and training effect. I’ve grown to love these, and they’re useful if you like to analyse how you work out, not just how much you can lift or how fast you run a kilometre. They aren’t necessary, but can be beneficial.









Verdict
The Garmin Venu 2 is a great watch for those who don’t need the hardcore performance monitoring of Garmin’s top watches. It leaves out some of the stats intended for athletes, but the less bulky design and colorful touchscreen display makes it fun to use day-to-day.

Key Features




Battery LifeThe big battery easily gets through the day


5GThis is one of the cheaper phones with 5G connectivity


Introduction
What price would you pay for 5G? That’s the burning question as we consider the Realme 8 5G – a new, budget contender that makes a few questionable compromises to deliver a speedy network connection and a low price.
Funnily enough, there’s a much stronger case to be made for the Realme 8 5G in the UK and in other Western markets. The brand’s key focus appears to be on India and Southeast Asia, where there’s precious little 5G infrastructure at present.
However, even here there’s a question over priorities. Is 5G connectivity more important to you in a best cheap phone than a properly rounded camera system, strong performance, and an optimal quality display? If so, then the Realme 8 5G might just be for you.
Prices start from £199 for 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, while the 6GB/128GB model costs £249. That entry model pricing is exactly the same as the equivalent (non-5G) Realme 8, while the higher model represents a £30 drop from last year’s equivalent Realme 7 5G. There’s no US pricing or likelihood of a release.
This presents a fairly unique dilemma: are you willing to sacrifice more than money for 5G connectivity?
Design and Screen
Sturdy, if plain, all-plastic bodyReliable side-mounted fingerprint sensor6.5-inch 90Hz display
The Realme 8 5G press blurb goes to great pains to highlight how thoroughly the company has tested its latest design, from the buttons to the USB-C connector. It’s also been put through vigorous temperature and humidity trials.
I’m not sure how these processes compare to those of its budget rivals (or even those of the best mid-range phones), but this is undoubtedly one of the most solid-feeling budget phones I’ve used of late.
Both its matte rim and shiny rear are formed of plastic, but there’s little in the way of flex or creak. Combine this with a weight of 185g in an 8.5mm-thick body, and the Realme 8 5G offers sufficient heft and density to not feel especially cheap.
The handset comes sporting a pretty bare bones design, though; there are no distinctive flourishes in the vein of the Realme 7 5G’s split finish. Realme talks confusingly about some kind of movie-inspired “Dynamic Speed Light” finish that brings about “dynamic change of light when the phone is shaken,” but all I see is a device that’s shiny and slightly reflective, which makes it look similar to countless other budget phones.
Supersonic Blue
The right-hand edge of the phone is home to a fingerprint sensor housed within a flat power button. I’m pleased to see that this has been placed in a slight recess for easy sight-free access, unlike the Poco F3. I can also report that it’s super-fast and reliable, especially for a budget phone, and would happily take it over the Realme 8 Pro’s flaky in-display alternative.
Like last year’s Realme 7 5G, the Realme 8 5G features a 6.5-inch 2400 x 1080 FHD+  LCD screen. However, the refresh rate has been cut from 120Hz to 90Hz.
It’s true that 120Hz displays aren’t always all they’re cracked up to be if supported by modest hardware, but when you take into consideration the fact that the Realme 8 and the Realme 8 Pro feature AMOLED screens (albeit at 60Hz), you can’t help but feel that the Realme 8 5G could have offered more.
This is actually a decent LCD panel, with relatively vibrant colours (there are 16.7 million of the suckers) and a strong 600-nit peak brightness. A 180Hz touch sampling rate makes it suitably responsive, too.
But it’s neither as vibrant nor quite as fluid as other phones at this end of the market. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G makes a similar compromise – but the Poco X3 NFC is a great example of what can be achieved in the budget category when you don’t have a largely needless 5G millstone around your neck.
Camera
48MP camera fall short of rest of rangeNo ultra-wide lensPoor video
Realme is making a big photographic push with its current Realme 8 range – but, once again, the Realme 8 5G feels like the runt of the litter.

For starters, you don’t get the Realme 8 Pro’s 108-megapixel main sensor here, nor even the Realme 8’s 64-megapixel downgrade. Rather, like the Realme 7 5G before it, the Realme 8 5G packs a 48-megapixel camera sensor with an f/1.8 aperture. 
I was quite happy with the level of detail and balance in the shots taken outside in daylight hours. They weren’t overly garish, thanks to Realme’s appealingly naturalistic colour science.
However, as soon as the light drops, the noise starts to encroach. Night mode shots look surprisingly good when briefly previewed on the device itself, with a reasonable degree of brightening and pleasingly deep colours. Look at them in greater detail, or on a larger screen, and you’ll see a whole lot of grain and a distinct lack of clarity. The lack of OIS isn’t unusual in a budget phone, but it contributes to these less-than-ideal results. See the sample shots below for an idea of the picture quality.



Low light performance
A far more noteworthy and regrettable absence is any form of ultra-wide sensor. It’s true that we criticised the Realme 8 Pro’s own ultra-wide camera, and that we haven’t met a sub-£300 phone with an ultra-wide that didn’t make us wince just a little. But not having one at all is a definite step back from the Realme 7 5G.
What you do get here is a pair of largely superfluous 2-megapixel assistant sensors, including a macro and a depth sensor. It shouldn’t surprise you to learn that the macro produces close-up shots (as close as 4cm) that are way too fuzzy to be of any real use or value.
The 16-megapixel selfie camera isn’t much cop either, producing noisier and more washed-out snaps compared to the main sensor – and with noticeable levels of overexposure. Skin tones also tend to be a little weird and rubbery.
The selfie camera
A final dose of decline and mediocrity comes in the video department, with support for a mere 1080p/30fps. The Realme 7 5G supported 4K at 30fps and 1080p at 120fps. Even at its low price, this far from one of the best camera phones. 
Performance
A step down from the previous genCapable CPU for general tasks, weak GPU for gamingClean and fast UI with lots of bloatware
The Realme 8 5G utilises a Dimensity 700 5G processor, which is built to a 7nm production standard. Once again, it represents a roll back from the Realme 7 5G and its Dimensity 800U 5G, albeit a fairly modest one.
Together with 4, 6, or 8GB of RAM (our model has 8GB, but UK buyers won’t have that option), it’s sufficient for solid baseline performance when navigating through home screens and flicking between apps. Those apps don’t boot up as fluidly as more expensive phones, but I wouldn’t say the experience was especially slow.
I did find that some of the memory management could be a little aggressive, though. Having started the lengthy initial update of Genshin Impact, I flicked out to do a spot of WhatsApp message triaging, only to find after a time that the progress of the update had been halted.
The PCMark battery test that I ran also failed to retain its information when I came back to it, although I can’t say for certain whether that was a problem with the phone or the app itself. Either way, the lack of stickability proved annoying given the length of the test.
Going back to Genshin Impact, MiHoYo’s epic action-RPG defaults to Lowest and 30fps settings. While it’s perfectly playable, you won’t get the most stable frame rate even at these most humble of settings.
The much older and less visually opulent PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, loads up with HD resources, HD graphics and High Frame Rate by default. Those are all a clear notch above what you get with the most affordable phones on the market. Once booted up, the original Battle Royale game plays reasonably smoothly.
Benchmark tests reveal that the Realme 8 5G’s CPU is pretty competitive for the price. An average Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 1749 places the Realme 8 5G roughly level with the much-heralded Poco X3 NFC and its more mainstream Snapdragon 732G CPU, which scored 1769. It’s markedly faster than the Moto G9 Power with its Snapdragon 662 CPU, which scored 1379.
However, in the GFX suite of benchmark tests, the Realme 8 5G lagged behind the Poco X3 NFC by around 30%. If there’s a weakness to the Dimensity 700 5G, it’s seemingly in the GPU department.

Essentially, you’re getting a phone that can run day-to-day tasks reasonably fluidly, but you won’t want to push it too far with the latest high-end games.
Realme UI 2.0 lends to this general feeling of fluidity. It still isn’t the ideal Android 11 skin, but it benefits from keeping things relatively smooth and uncluttered. 
Its icons are crisp and round (at least by default), the Settings menu isn’t too fiddly to navigate, and Google Feed is situated to the left of the homescreen. In other words, it does the basic stuff well.
There’s a fair amount of bloat on my test device, but there are mitigating circumstances. This particular unit was intended for the Southeast Asian market, as evidenced by the presence of unfamiliar apps such as Lazada and WeTV.
But you also get more familiar pre-installed apps such as TikTok and Netflix, as well as a bevy of home-brewed efforts such as Soloop (a video editor), Realme Link (a smart device manager), and additional storefronts for both apps and themes. And it’s a cardinal sin to provide an additional web browser on top of Google Chrome, whatever the region.
Battery life
Large 5000mAh batteryGood for two days of light use18w charging
The Realme 8 5G really is going all in on 5G as its defining feature. Which perhaps explains the reason the one component that hasn’t been scaled back from the Realme 7 5G is the battery.
At 5000mAh, it’s sizeable power pack alright, and one that’s evidently been included as a means to fuel those thirsty next-gen network speeds. Sadly, I wasn’t able to put that to the test, through a combination of lockdown living and patchy 5G availability in my area and on my network.
But in general terms, the Realme 8 5G’s stamina impresses. At the end of a 12-hour day of fairly heavy use, which entailed 5 hours of screen-on time, I was left with exactly 50% in the tank.
This means that the Realme 8 5G has the potential to go for a full two days between charges, if you don’t go too hard on the media.
Recharging is handled by a bundled 18W USB Type-C charger. That isn’t the fastest provision out there, with other budget manufacturers providing 33W bricks in the box. 
Realme itself provides a 30W charger in the plain Realme 8, as it did in the Realme 7 5G. It’s another unfortunate roll back among many, but it isn’t calamitous in and of itself. Some flagship phones don’t even give you a charging brick, after all.
Conclusion
The Realme 8 5G is a competently built budget phone, offering admirable stamina and, of course, 5G connectivity. 
Its 90Hz LCD screen is of adequate quality, and the phone’s performance is perfectly decent for everyday tasks. 
However, Realme has had to make a series of cuts in order to hit an aggressive price point, and the result is the least appealing phone in the three-strong Realme 8 family.

Should you buy it?


You want a 5G phone on a budget: This is one of the cheaper 5G phones around and if access to the faster data speeds is a must then this will get the job done.


You want the best performing, feature-rich budget phone: The Realme 8 5G isn’t the best pick for gaming nor does it have the best screen at this price.









Verdict
The Realme 8 5G goes out of its way to provide 5G at a super-low price, but the resulting cuts take their toll. In terms of display, design, performance and camera, the phone lags behind the rest of the range, not to mention its rivals.

Verdict































Despite high expectations, OnePlus’ first wearable is a big misfire. The forward thinking ideas and attention to detail that have come to define the company’s smartphones are just nowhere to be found here. There are far better wearables for a fraction of the price, while a slight bump in budget can net you the likes of the Coros Pace 2 or even an Apple Watch 3, all of which you should consider before going anywhere near the OnePlus Watch.

Sleep tracking


After countless rumours, plenty of leaks and an unfortunate amount of hype, the OnePlus Watch has finally seen the light of day, but this is one wearable that probably should’ve stayed in the dark.
Starting with Apple, the precedent has been set that if you’re a manufacturer of smartphones, you must also sell your own smartwatch. This has been the case for Samsung, Huawei, Honor, Xiaomi and more. Even Google is rumoured to launch a Pixel Watch at some point this year.
As something of an underdog, OnePlus has brought some great ideas to the table in its smartphones, and naturally it was assumed that if the company did branch out into wearables, then the occasion would merit something truly special. Well, the OnePlus Watch is here, and all those assumptions can be put to rest.
Design and screen 
Minimalist but on the verge of boringLarge 1.39-inch display is bright and easy to readThe OnePlus Watch’s design is unlikely to catch anyone’s attentionThe included watch strap is comfortable to wear and great for workouts
Unlike the general consensus of critics, I don’t mind the look of the OnePlus Watch. It is by no stretch the most boring smartwatch I’ve seen (that goes to the TicWatch C2 Plus), but there is a certain casual elegance that doesn’t feel quite justified for what’s on offer here.

There’s no rotating crown to speak of as the only physical inputs are two buttons on the watch’s right-hand side, one of which has the OnePlus name etched into it. The included fluoroelastomer watch strap is almost identical to the one on the Apple Watch, but the outer side features some minor texturing to differentiate the two.
What really stands out about the OnePlus Watch’s design is its massive screen. The 1.39-inch AMOLED display might feel too big to some, particularly those with small wrists, but I did find that the larger than usual retail space meant that more vibrant watch faces were really given their due. Trust me, you won’t need to do a double take with text this big.
Despite its large size, the OnePlus Watch doesn’t feel heavy on the wrist, nor did it ever feel intrusive. What I will say, however, is that except for the screen, nothing about the OnePlus Watch’s design grabs your attention. It’s as if OnePlus pretended it was already several iterations into its smartwatch series, and therefore felt the general public didn’t need to be wowed. This is not what I’d expect from a first-gen product.
Features and performance
The move away from Wear OS has been squanderedDay-to-day operation is speedy and without slowdownNo third-party app store, with mostly basic features includedSleep tracking does a great job of breaking down information
A great deal of buzz has formed around the news the OnePlus Watch isn’t using Wear OS. Given Wear OS has been stagnant for some time and that Samsung has had plenty of success with Tizen, I was intrigued to see what OnePlus could present as an alternative. After several weeks of testing, I’ve not been this disappointed in a long time.

What you have here is a system that doesn’t utilise third-party apps like Wear OS or watchOS do, but instead features a bunch of standard native apps for music control, weather updates, breathing exercises, timers and more. These are handy things to have, but it’s an almost identical feature-set to the Honor Watch ES fitness tracker, which retails at a much lower price point. The only two things that genuinely sets the OnePlus Watch apart is its use as a TV remote – a feature rendered instantly useless without a OnePlus TV – and the ability to store music locally for offline playback (don’t expect Spotify or Deezer integration here).
Don’t expect the OnePlus Watch to wow you with its watch faces either, as the collection is about as bland as it gets. Some of the designs lean so heavily into the minimalist concept that you have to squint to see the dials. It’s not as egregious as when a fashion brand fails to deliver a decent watch face (cue memories of the Skagen Falster 3), but I would’ve expected more from OnePlus than this.
Luckily, the OnePlus Watch holds its own where sleep tracking is concerned. Using data provided by the watch, the OnePlus Health app provides a written assessment to detail in plain English whether you’ve slept well, and the benefits or repercussions depending on how you fared. It also breaks the information down into sleep stages, to understand how well you performed at each stage and if your wake-up time remained consistent with previous data. It does a great job of breaking down the jargon into an easy-to-understand format, so props to OnePlus for that. 
Performance wise, the OnePlus Watch runs just fine. Running through menus is a breeze and I never noticed any slowdown that would mar the experience. It did receive a small performance update during my testing which made the tilt-to-take feature noticeably more responsive, but it’s also worth pointing out that the always-on function had yet to appear (although it is coming soon).

Fitness tracking 
More of a fumble than a photo finishA shockingly low amount of workouts can be trackedHeart rate and GPS tracking do not provide accurate resultsThere are better fitness trackers out there at a lower price
Once I realised that the OnePlus Watch more closely mirrored a Honor fitness trackers, I (wrongly) assumed the wearable might impress in the fitness tracking arena. After all, the bottom right-hand button, by default, takes you to a list of tracked workouts so you can kick things off without haste.
Let’s start with the workouts on offer – all 14 of them. I honestly had to double check additional workouts weren’t hiding behind a menu somewhere – commonplace activities such as strength training and HIIT are nowhere to be seen. Similarly, there are only two sports available to be tracked: cricket and badminton. I’ll gladly admit I’m no sports fan, but I’m pretty sure that there are more popular sports that would warrant attention.
Heart rate tracking was a mixed bag, too. For instance, on a 35-minute outdoor run the OnePlus Watch tracked an average of heart rate of 142BPM and a high of 178BPM, while a dedicated chest strap sensor came back with 145BPM and 183BPM, respectively. That’s not a terrible discrepancy, but the results differed greatly during a 25-minute rowing session, with the OnePlus Watch picking up a high of 167BPM on what should have been 175BPM. I must sound like a broken record, but the Honor Watch ES turned in better results than this.
Unfortunately, the untethered GPS tracking didn’t fare much better. With an accompanying Apple Watch SE (and the fact that I’ve done enough Park Runs to know the length of the route), the OnePlus Watch downgraded my 5.8k run to just 4.14k. Maybe the wearable is secretly trying to get me to run more – either way, I can’t say I much appreciated the difference.

Battery life
The one triumph for the OnePlus WatchYou can easily get 10+ days of battery life on a single chargeCharging is quick, netting you an additional 80% in just under an hour
If there’s one immediate advantage of OnePlus moving away from Wear OS, it’s in battery life. From a full battery, the OnePlus Watch still had 17% left after 10 days, and the only reason I needed to charge it was to proceed with a firmware update. Otherwise, I’m certain the OnePlus Watch could’ve lasted at least another two days.
OnePlus quotes a battery life of up to 14-days, which I’m sure could be reached in some use cases – as you don’t go overboard with the GPS and fitness tracking. Charging also operates brilliantly, as I was able to get back to 100% (from 17%) in just shy of an hour. This should allow plenty of longevity from a quick 10-minute charge.
Conclusion
It’d be too easy to lambast the OnePlus Watch for completely missing the mark, but more than anything it’s disappointing such a product exists in the first place. I’m a big fan of OnePlus’ smartphones, and the company’s work has helped to spark innovation, but for whatever reason, that OnePlus style is nowhere to be seen here. I’ll happily concede the battery life is long and the screen is nice and bright, but other than that I can’t think of a single reason why you’d buy the OnePlus Watch over the Honor Watch ES, or even over the Honor Band 5. If you’re after a richer smartwatch experience, the Apple Watch 3 can be had for just £50 more.

Only if you want a massive screen on a wearable: there’s not a lot to like about the OnePlus Watch, but its massive screen is easy on the eyes and makes everything comfortable to read.


You want a competent fitness tracker/smartwatch: the OnePlus Watch doesn’t stand out in any particular way, and it’s easily bested by cheaper wearables.

Verdict


































This is a great phone that’s easy to recommend. It takes the great 11 Pro, tweaks it and adds in a glorious new design that takes things to the next level. It’s a bit of a shame that the Pro Max has the potential for an even better camera though, and a high refresh rate screen would have been nice. Maybe next year.



Pros
A very welcome redesignReliable cameras in all situationsAccurate HDR displayGreat size

Cons
High refresh rate screen feels sorely missed on the Pro modelPro Max bags the bigger camera upgrades

Key Specifications
Review Price: £9996.1-inch OLED displayA14 Bionic chipset6GB RAM, 5G128/256/512GB storage3x 12MP camerasFaceID


The iPhone 12 Pro is Apple’s current flagship, offering an even more refined iPhone 12 with a smattering of design and feature improvements. 
If you want the best of what Apple has to offer in a 6.1-inch size, and are willing to pay the £999/$999 starting price, then the iPhone 12 Pro is for you.
Along with features like the A14 chipset, 5G, faster cameras and the svelte new design we saw on the iPhone 12, the Pro adds more camera skills, a classier design, double the base storage and more RAM.
So, is it worth spending that bit extra cash and is this the best phone around?
Design

The iPhone 12 Pro is a modern take on the iPhone 5

From the moment I unboxed the graphite version of the iPhone 12 Pro I knew Apple made the right decision. Going back to a design made iconic by the iPhone 5, but tuning it up even further, makes so much sense and it completely works. This is not only the best looking iPhone ever, but the best looking phone you can buy right now.
While the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro visually are very similar, the Pro lives up to its name by feeling a fair bit smarter. 
The rails are a super-shiny and seriously smudgy stainless steel, as opposed to aluminium, and the back is frosted glass. The colour choices too are less playful, with light hues ditched for more menacing darker ones. Well, that is apart from the gold variety, which is downright bling-tastic.
Thanks to this use of stainless steel, the 12 Pro has a weightier feel. It’s not heavy at 189g, but it is definitely denser than its cheaper sibling. These steel sides are also softer to the touch, and more pleasing to grip on to for extended periods. The frosted glass rear is a plus too, eschewing all fingerprints completely.

It might be heavier, but the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are identical in size, dimensions and IP rating for water resistance. If you buy a case for one, it’ll fit the other. Of course, if you want a bigger phone then the 6.7-inch display toting Max version is coming soon.
The 6.1-inch screen is larger than the 11 Pro, however the phone itself is only marginally taller. It remains one of the smaller flagships around, offering a respite from the huge amount of large-screen devices. I can grip it with one hand without feeling like I’m going to drop it, and the extra screen, when compared to the 11 Pro, is welcome. While I would normally sway towards the larger end when it comes to a phone, this is a very nice middle-ground.
Covering the display of the iPhone 12 Pro is Apple’s new ‘Ceramic Shield’ glass. This is developed in conjunction with Corning and is, according to Apple, 4x better at withstanding drops than previous models. Apple has added nano-ceramic crystals into the glass which are said to make it much stronger and this is combined with the previously used dual ion-exchange for scratch resistance.

The iPhone 12 Pro isn’t likely any more scratch resistant than the iPhone 11 or 11 Pro, though. And often when things become better at withstanding drops, they become more susceptible to other types of damage, like scratches. My screen is still clean of scratches, however my iPhone 11 Pro’s display has picked up all matter of dings and small scratches over the past 12 months.
Screen

No ProMotion, but this is still a great display

I had never expected Apple to roll out a fast refresh-rate display across the whole iPhone range, however I was hoping a 90 or 120Hz iPad Pro-like ProMotion panel might find its way onto the Pro model. That’s not the case here, and the new panel remains locked at 60Hz. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it does mean the iPhone 12 Pro isn’t quite as smooth in operation as the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.
That quibble aside, the display here remains fantastic. It ticks every box I look for, including fantastic (but importantly accurate) colour reproduction, amazing levels of contrast and enough brightness to comfortably view outdoors in tougher conditions. The OLED panel produces perfect blacks, HDR content at 1200 nits for visible improvements and the surrounding bezel is super-thin.
You don’t have any manual control over the display – a feature now common on Android – but when it’s this good out-of-the-box I don’t really need to fiddle with any settings.
While the media experience is mostly fantastic, the notch is still here and does still make the display feel a little bit smaller than it should. You’ll likely forget about fairly quickly and the Face ID benefits are clear, yet I do wish Apple had, by now, managed to shrink it.

With the iPhone 11 Pro last year, you knew you were getting a seriously better display by paying more over the iPhone 11. That’s not really the case here, as the iPhone 12 is now pretty much on par with this panel. Both are OLED, have the XDR branding and the same resolution. They can also both hit 1200 nits peak brightness when you’re watching HDR content. The only real difference I can spot is a slightly higher general brightness on the Pro model, giving the screen a brighter white look when you’re outside.
Performance

The iPhone 12 Pro is currently unmatched for speed

Powering the entire iPhone 12 line right from the Mini to the Max is the A14 Bionic chipset. This is Apple’s most efficient silicone yet, with a 5nm process and a vastly improved neural engine for AI. There’s also a 5G modem inside, giving you access to the fast data network if you’re in a supported area (and have the right network deal). Many bands of 5G are supported and the US version of the device has an extra antenna on the side for mmWave UWB connectivity. We don’t have this yet in the UK, so it’s not a loss that it’s missing.
5G was the buzzword during the 12 Pro’s launch event and it is being pushed heavily by carriers as a revolution in how you use your phone. They’ll probably be right in a few years when the service is far more widespread, but as of now I think the noticeable difference for most is minimal. I live in an area where 5G is available if I walk a bit down the street and while its nice to see that 5G logo pop up, the actual download speeds on Three are barely higher than 4G and actually a lot less than an EE 4G SIM I used to compare.

 What is 5G?

In a few years when 5G is far more widespread and we’re out again attending gigs and back in big stadiums and festivals then the benefits will likely be a lot more obvious. For now though, it’s far from a must.
Interestingly, Apple has a Smart 5G feature enabled by default that switches you back down to 4G if it judges you don’t really need the benefits of the faster network. This seems to be a good way to juggle battery life and faster speeds, only giving you the full power of 5G when you’re downloading something.

The iPhone 12 Pro is one of the fastest phones around – if not the fastest. I haven’t noticed any lag or slowdown during my time with the phone and save for a few iOS 14 bugs the experience has been fluid and fantastic. In the synthetic Geekbench 5 benchmark app – which should give a decent overall view of performance – the phone scores 1597 in single-core and 3968 in multi-core. This is a seriously high score on both counts.
Games run like a dream and there’s enough good stuff on Apple Arcade to make this a great little portable gaming machine. Especially when you connect up a controller.
The 12 Pro also benefits from more RAM than the iPhone 12 (6GB as opposed to 4GB) and while it’s hard to spot the benefit it should keep the phone fast over a number of years. You’ve also got base storage of 128GB (alongside 256GB and 512GB variants) available – that’s double the iPhone 12. These two reasons might make the upgrade worth it for some. 
Audio from the speakers is very good, call quality is strong and there’s Wi-Fi 6 support if you have the right router. 
Camera

Small tweaks in every area make a big difference

It’s with the camera skills where the iPhone 12 Pro truly sets itself apart from the cheaper iPhone 12 and stands as one of the best camera phones around. Along with an extra 12-megapixel sensor with a 52mm equivalent lens for 2x shots, there’s a clever LiDAR sensor that enables faster low-light focusing. Its video skills are marginally better too, with 60fps video supported when you’re shooting in Dolby Vision HDR.

In terms of the main 12MP wide camera though, the Pro has the same set-up as the iPhone 12. The Pro Max, on the other hand, has a much bigger sensor so that could be the model to look out for if you really want the best camera experience. The final camera is an f/2.4 ultra wide which can now take Night Mode shots.
The main 12MP wide camera has a faster f/1.6 lens which lets in more light and it also benefits from a few updates on the back-end, including Smart HDR 3. This is very noticeable, as it really helps exposure and dynamic range look great in snaps. Even if you’re taking a photo of tricky environments, you’ll have level exposure pretty much every time. Colours don’t blow and highlights and shadows are accurate.

Apple added Deep Fusion last year and it used once again to really bring out a high level of detail. See the photo of the dried flower below and you can pick out individual details that aren’t visible in the photos of other phones.
Detail is fantastic
Where the iPhone falls down slightly is in its zoom skills. While shots from the 2x camera are good, these just can’t compete with phones like the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which have periscope lenses for true optical zooming to 5x and 10x.
I like the addition of the ultra wide sensor, and being able to use Night Mode with it makes it more useful. Yet, the sensor is still not as good as the main camera and snaps are a lot worse. It’s nice for variety though. 
LiDAR is a new sensor on the 12 Pro and it helps mainly with low-light performance (along with some AR tricks). For instance, focusing in poor lighting is far better and more accurate than on previous iPhones and the iPhone 12. Instead of lots of focus hunting, it locks on right away. Low-light portraits are enabled too, and again can look good if you frame things right.
It’s a tough call of which phone has the better low-light performance – but that’s not a bad thing. Blacks are a little deeper on Pixel 5 shots, while the secondary cameras are better on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. I like the reliability of the iPhone though, and the Night Mode usually churns out good pictures even if you still can’t manually enable it.


Low-light ultra wide
On the front, there’s a 12MP camera and it is very much the same as before. Selfies are fine, but they can look a little washed out when compared to the contrasty look you’ll get from a Pixel 5. It’s very accurate for facial unlocking though.
Video has always been a highlight of the iPhone and things are improved once again with HDR. 
HDR gives you better contrast, brighter colours and an overall more pleasing look. It makes the already excellent footage that bit better. 
The iPhone 12 Pro records HDR video in an HLG format (a favourite of broadcasters, like the BBC) with some Dolby Vision encoding on top to give scene-by-scene metadata. 
The results are stunning and especially when viewed on the iPhone 12 Pro’s HDR screen. Colours pop, skies stand out and there’s a real sense of flair that now feels missing when I go back to the iPhone 11.
Of course, there are some compatibility issues. Apps will struggle with the video and even trying to view it on a Dolby Vision TV with an Apple TV 4K also isn’t successful due to the formats used. You might want to turn it off (it’s on by default) if you want them to be as widely compatible as possible. 
Battery life

MagSafe is a nice option, though you’ll likely be buying your own charger too

You probably know by now that the iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t come with a plug inside the box. There are no headphones either. Apple says this is to aid its aim of going carbon neutral and it does make for a far slimmer box.
But, by keeping the Lightning port (and not switching to USB C) I think most people will still need to buy themselves Apple’s new 20w plug – that is unless you’re updating from the 11 Pro. 
For one, the cable included needs a USB-C port-toting plug, so it won’t attach to an older one. Those older chargers (we’re talking base iPhone 11 and older) have measly 5w adaptors that charge very slowly. You’ll be looking at multiple hours to fully charge this phone with a 5w charger.

As a result, you really do need to buy another adaptor and that’s an extra £20 to add to the price of the phone. You can also pick up the new MagSafe Charger (again, this will need a 20w plug). This is a magnetic puck that attaches satisfyingly to the back and charges wirelessly, using the Qi standard at 15w. It’s faster than using any old wireless pad, but whereas you’ll get 50% juice from 30 minutes plugged in, you’ll need an hour to get that far with MagSafe. Still, it solves one of the biggest issues I have had with wireless charging as you can use the phone while it’s charging.
Apple improved the battery life notably last year with the iPhone 11 Pro, and you’ll get roughly the same endurance from the new model largely due to the addition of 5G and larger display. I’ve been comfortably getting through the day and managing to hit six hours of screen-on time. If you’re coming from an iPhone X or XS, you’ll notice the improvement.
The MagSafe Charger
Should you buy the iPhone 12 Pro?
The iPhone 12 Pro is £300/$200 more expensive than the iPhone 12 and for that you to get a nice selection of benefits that are certainly worth it if you want the best iPhone experience. The materials are classier, there’s a little more RAM and base storage, the cameras are far more versatile and the screen is a bit brighter.

The camera improvements will be reason enough for many to plump for this model and I do appreciate the extra versatility of not only the zoom lens, but the LiDAR sensor for both low-light portraits and faster focusing.
Overall, this is a great phone that’s easy to recommend. It takes the great 11 Pro, tweaks it and adds in a glorious new design that takes things to the next level. It’s a bit of a shame that the Pro Max has the potential for an even better camera though, and a high refresh rate screen would have been nice. Maybe next year.

FAQs
What are the iPhone 12 pro colours? You can get the iPhone 12 Pro in blue, grey, silver and gold  Apple iPhone 12 Pro release date? Apple released the iPhone 12 Pro on 23 October 2020  Is the iPhone 12 Pro waterproof? The iPhone 12 Pro has an IP68 rating, meaning it is resistant to some, but not all, water.  Is iPhone 12 Pro dual SIM? You can have one SIM and one eSIM with the iPhone 12 Pro, so it is dual sim in some respects. It doesn’t hold two separate SIM cards, though.  Is the iPhone 12 pro 5G?

Verdict




























 



The Nokia 5.4 provides an all-round competent budget phone experience, and we’ll always appreciate Nokia’s pure approach to Android. 




Pros

Stock Android
Solid Nokia design
Decent battery life
Adequate main camera



Cons

Dull, soft 720p display
Sluggish performance
Slow charging
Terrible ultra-wide camera






Key Specifications

Review Price: £159.99
720p display
Android One
48MP main camera
4000mAh battery



For several years now, the HMD Global resurrected Nokia smartphone brand has been offering a certain type of no-nonsense package made up of solid build quality, pure Android software, and affordable price tags. That’s all most certainly true about the Nokia 5.4.
The Nokia 5.4 occupies one of the most competitive areas of the smartphone market – aiming to be one of the best cheap phones. At £159.99/$249.99/€189, it’s in direct competition with the likes of the Motorola Moto G30 and the Realme 7, both of which provide one or two stand-out features for a modest amount of money.
Compared to such strong rivals, the Nokia 5.4 runs the risk of blending into the background. As competent as the phone is, it fails to stand out in any meaningful way.
Nokia 5.4 design and screen  – Workmanlike in all departments

Solid but dull all-plastic design
Rather heavy given the materials
Poor 720p LCD screen

We’re well familiar with the modern Nokia design language by now. Scan through our previous reviews and you’ll probably see words such as ‘solid’, ‘dependable’ and ‘unshowy’ bandied around.
The Nokia 5.4 fits all three of those descriptions. It’s an all-plastic affair with a shiny rear panel and a matte rim, hinting at the more premium glass and metal materials you tend to get further up the market. There’s a fair amount of flex to the phone when you give it a solid twist and squeeze with both hands.

Despite the extensive use of plastic, this is a surprisingly heavy device at 181g. It’s thick, too, at 8.7mm.
It’s a perfectly fine design as cheap phones go, although I’d rather see manufacturers of cheap phones really lean into the plastic aesthetic and properly do away with the shiny metal and glass-aping finishes. They’re not fooling anyone, and it only attracts greasy fingerprints.
Talking of fingerprints, the Nokia 5.4’s biometric sensor is stashed on the back of the phone, just below a prominent centrally mounted camera module. It’s reliable enough, although it’s also quite shallow and tricky to find in a snap. It can be incredibly slow to unlock, too.
The front of the phone gives you a deeply underwhelming 6.39-inch display. It’s an LCD, and not a particularly great example at that. Colours are dim and muted, and it only gets to 400 nits of brightness. 
Meanwhile, a resolution of 720 x 1560 makes video and photo content look disappointingly fuzzy. I’ve said it before, but 1080p (or FHD) really should be the bare minimum by now, certainly on devices costing £150 upwards.

Another disappointment is the display’s bog standard 60Hz refresh rate. Yes, we’re talking about a £160 phone here. But the Motorola Moto G30 and the Realme 7 give you a 90Hz refresh rate for similar money, and the Poco X3 Pro offers the full 120Hz for not much more.
Nokia 5.4 camera – Competent main shooter in good lighting, poor everywhere else

Adequate shots for the money from the 48-megapixel main camera
5-megapixel ultra-wide is truly awful
2-megapixel macro and depth 

The Nokia 5.4 ostensibly features a quad-camera setup, but only the main (wide) sensor is worth a damn. It certainly isn’t one of the best camera phones around, even at this price. 
Still, credit where it’s due: this 48-megapixel sensor is an upgrade over the 13-megapixel unit belonging to its predecessor, the Nokia 5.3. Paired with a wide f/1.8 aperture and PDAF (phase-detection auto focus), it’s a reasonably capable shooter in good lighting.

I was able to grab some surprisingly crisp and balanced shots off the bat, although there are plenty of issues. Zooming in will reveal considerable noise and over-sharpening, and any kind of pronounced movement tends to get picked up on, suggesting a sluggish shutter. It can struggle with dynamic range, too, blowing out bright skies and white T-shirts on a sunny day.
Portrait mode is able to isolate subject from background reasonably well for a cheap phone, but the bokeh effect isn’t especially convincing or appealing. Night shots, meanwhile, are a complete write-off. With no OIS, a small sensor, limited optics and modest processing power, low-light shots take ages to snap yet produce a dark, grainy mess.

 
These are all complaints that could be levelled at other phones of a similar price, to varying degrees. And you’ll appreciate the work that Nokia has done with that 48-megapixel main sensor as soon as you switch to the 5-megapixel ultra-wide. 
It’s truly terrible, yielding woefully soft, noisy shots even in good lighting. The edges devolve into such grainy mush that they can look like you’ve activated some dodgy art filter. It also sports a much duller, greyer colour tone compared to the main sensor. 


Night shots are terrible
The 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors are barely worth the space they occupy, and we’re not going to waste any of your time discussing them. They’re terrible and useless, respectively. 
One camera you’re far more likely to use is the Nokia 5.4’s 16-megapixel front-facing unit. Obviously it isn’t the best example of such a thing, but it’s capable of taking respectable selfies.

Nokia 5.4 performance – Snapdragon 662 hits par, but the phone feels sluggish

Snapdragon 662 offers adequate speed
General lack of smoothness
3D will run at low settings

You don’t expect razor-sharp performance at this price, but we’re now at the point where the base experience of unlocking, flipping through homescreens and menus, and hopping between the usual apps needs to hit a base level of fluidity.
Unfortunately, the Nokia 5.4 just doesn’t measure up. It uses a lower-mid-range Snapdragon 662 in conjunction with 4GB of RAM, which is a modest if reasonable setup. It’s the same chip that powers the aforementioned Moto G30 and the Moto G9 Power, and it yields a comparable Geekbench 5 score.
But in the hand, everything feels a little too wallowy and stuttery. Perhaps I’ve been using too many high-refresh-rate smartphones recently, but there’s simply no flow to using this phone.
As I’ve already mentioned, unlocking it can take an age, and flicking between homescreens feels juddery and stilted. I’ve warned against completely buying into the 120Hz promise of cheap phones before – they never live up to their more expensive counterparts – but the opposite end of the spectrum is the Nokia 5.4, which doesn’t even seem to nail a solid 60Hz experience. 
When it comes to PUBG, you can expect most advanced 3D games to run okay on low to medium settings. PUB Mobile will recommend the low-end resource pack when first booting up, and can then be played on Balanced/Medium – just one rung up on the graphical settings ladder. It runs fine at that modest level, if not massively fluidly.

You get 64GB of storage here, which is fine for the money. Although it should be noted that many phones in the sub-£200/$300 category have started providing 128GB as standard, such as the Moto G9 Power and the Poco X3 NFC. Still, there’s at least a micro-SDXC slot here, so there is potential for expansion.
Nokia 5.4 battery life – Easily exceeds the one-day mark

4000mAh battery is decent if not class-leading
Well over a day of normal use
10W charger isn’t massively speedy

The Nokia 5.4 is powered along by a 4000mAh battery. That wouldn’t provide any great reason to celebrate in a better-specced phone, but given this handset’s modest 720p display and meagre processor, it isn’t a bad provision by any means.
It will easily survive a day of moderate use, and take you well into a second. Power users will see that figure dropping to a day, but then this really isn’t a phone for power users. Its screen and processor does no favours to video and gaming content.
Still, if you really want strong stamina at this sort of price, then the Moto G9 Power with its 6000 mAh battery is a much better bet. The Nokia 5.4 can’t even get close to this rival budget phone’s figures.
With the Nokia, I observed that an hour of Netflix streaming with the screen brightness at 50% sapped 12% of a charge. The Moto G9 Power lost just 7%, and that was with the screen brightness whacked up to 100%.
You get a modest 10W charger bundled in the box, which got me from 50% to 54% in 15 minutes, and up to 57% in 30 minutes. That really isn’t very fast – especially when the likes of the Poco X3 Pro and the Realme 7 give you significantly faster 30W+ chargers.
Nokia 5.4 conclusion
The Nokia 5.4 provides an all-round competent budget phone experience, and we’ll always appreciate Nokia’s pure approach to Android.
But that no longer feels like enough in today’s competitive budget market, where one or two stand-out features aren’t uncommon. This is a phone that completely underwhelms with its drab screen and sluggish performance, while an improved camera can still only manage acceptable wide shots in good lighting. It isn’t a bad phone by any means, but the Nokia 5.4 simply fails to shine with any of the basics.
You should buy the Nokia 5.4 if…

You want the cleanest Android possible for the price
Nokia doesn’t load any bloatware and hefty skin over its version of Android, so the software you get is clean and easy to use.


You’re a fan of Nokia’s solid, no-nonsense design
While HMD’s Nokia phones aren’t quite as indestructible as Nokia phones of old, they retain a durable look and feel that’s often rare in the Android space.

You should not buy the Nokia 5.4 if…

You watch or play a lot of games and videos
This is a cheap phone, but it can’t compare to other devices at this price when it comes to performance. If you want a gaming device, look elsewhere.


You like to take ultra-wide snaps
As noted in the review, the ultra-wide camera is terrible. As are the other duo of secondary sensors. If you want variety with your cameras then this device isn’t for you.

Verdict




























 



The Oppo Find X3 Lite isn't a bad phone, delivering decent battery life and processing performance – but you might feel a little underwhelmed by the screen and the camera when compared to similarly priced rivals.



Pros

Brilliant fast-charging
Good battery life
Smart design
Decent processing performance



Cons

Screen isn't super
Camera could be better






Key Specifications

Review Price: £379.99
Snapdragon 765G chipset
8GB RAM
64-megapixel main camera
6.4-inch AMOLED screen
4300mAh battery
128GB storage



The Oppo Find X3 Lite is the junior partner in Oppo’s new smartphone series.
The Lite joins the excellent Oppo Find X3 Pro and Oppo Find X3 Neo in the 2021 range, sitting as the cheapest option if you want a taste of what Oppo is offering.
While it is more affordable, it still makes for a promising overall package, including a 5G chipset, a 64-megapixel camera, and speedy charging.
If you’re hunting for a phone on a budget, is this the right pick? Especially with some other excellent picks in our best cheap phone and best mid-range phone round ups.
Oppo Find X3 Lite design and screen – Appealing appearance, though with some niggles

The vibrant matte back panel is striking
It feels lighter in the hand than some clumpier rivals
No IP rating or SD card support
The screen is not bad, but a bit dim

For the most part, Oppo gets the design of the Find X3 Lite just right.
Our unit arrived in an arresting Astral Blue colour scheme (black and silver versions are also available), which looks lively and fresh. Even better is the fact that the finish is matte rather than gloss, so it won’t pick up scuffs or smears easily.
The sides are made of polished metal, and the rear panel is plastic rather than glass, which isn’t quite so premium. However, the result of the latter is a device that feels noticeably lightweight for its size, at just 172g.

The fingerprint scanner is embedded in the screen and worked swiftly, without a hitch in all the time I used it. The same can be said for the face unlock option, which is also available. Plus, there’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack to facilitate listening to music or podcasts in the old-fashioned way. You won’t find this on the pricier Find X3 models.
However, nothing is perfect. The Find X3 Lite doesn’t have an IP68 rating, so we don’t know how it will react to water splashes or immersion, and the lack of an SD card slot means you’re stuck with 128GB of storage alongside any cloud services you may use.
The Find X3 Lite’s screen measures 6.43 inches, which is plenty generous, and it has a decent 1080 x 2400 resolution. It’s an AMOLED display and delivers better contrast than its LCD rivals. It has an enhanced refresh rate of 90Hz over the standard 60Hz for smoother scrolling.

My main bugbear with this screen is just that it isn’t all that bright. Typical brightness is just 600 nits – the maximum being 900 – so I found myself having to ramp it up manually rather than leave it on the auto settings when I was using it in brighter conditions.
The screen isn’t at all bad, but those of rivals such as the Poco F3 are significantly better, and so deserve your attention if the display is your priority.
Oppo Find X3 Lite camera — Satisfactory, but not super

Fairly good performance from the main camera
Macro camera isn’t up to much

The Find X3 Lite has four camera sensors altogether on the back, with the 64-megapixel main sensor the headliner. In addition to this, it has an 8-megapixel ultra-wide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro snapper.

I was satisfied with pictures from the main sensor, which provided fairly sharp in detail with accurate colours.

The main camera performs fairly well in low-light conditions, too, reducing noise relatively effectively:

While there isn’t a telephoto or optical zoom option, you can use digital zoom to capture close-ups. The photo below was captured with the 5x digital zoom option, taken from distance so as not to disturb the bird, and the sensor’s high resolution means that it’s still just about usable.

However, while the main camera does deliver decent performance, I had hoped for more from a 64-megapixel sensor. Bear in mind that the Pixel 4a costs a bit less and it is among the best camera phones.
The ultra-wide sensor is another useful snapper in case you want to include more in your shot, and the results are fairly good:

The macro camera doesn’t offer much and is rarely useful – but, for whatever reason, it seems that mid-range Android smartphones all offer one these days anyway. Here’s a macro shot of some blossom, which is pretty disappointing:

Overall, this camera gets the job done, and will probably meet your expectations without ever blowing you away.
Oppo Find X3 Lite Performance – Competitive mid-range capabilities

Good mid-range performance capabilities
Offers 5G connectivity

The Oppo Find X3 Lite runs on the Snapdragon 765G chipset, which was released in late 2019 and was Qualcomm’s first to boast an integrated 5G modem.
This 5G capability is a significant selling point for this phone, providing access to the highest mobile data speeds where available.
As for day-to-day performance, I had no issues using any apps (the impressive 8GB of RAM surely comes in useful for multi-tasking), and mobile games ran very well.

The Find X3 Lite is firmly mid-range when it comes to performance, but compares very well even to the OnePlus Nord, which features the same silicon, as you can see from our benchmarking tests below:

The Geekbench scores measure CPU performance, while 3DMark scores assess the GPU capability.
As for the software, this device runs Android 11 with Oppo’s ColorOS user interface. This means you’ll get quite a few apps pre-installed, which can be a little annoying.
Nevertheless, it’s very customisable and offers a lot of sneaky shortcuts, such as split-screen mode and a smart sidebar for efficient multi-tasking. I’d say it’s one of the better Android interfaces.
Oppo Find X3 Lite battery life – Strong endurance and incredibly fast charging

Reliable battery life
Astonishingly fast charging

The Oppo Find X3 Lite has a 4300mAh battery, and in my experience this lasted well, never dying on me before the day was out – even under heavy use. After an hour of watching YouTube, a fully charged battery was down by just 5%; for an hour of online music streaming, it took just a 1% hit.
It’s even more impressive when you come to charge the device back up again. From a completely dead battery, the Find X3 Lite was fully charged in just 40 minutes, thanks to the incredible SuperVOOC charging system – you’ll hardly believe your eyes as the percentage ticks up rapidly. It’s an incredibly useful feature if you’re running late and realise your phone needs a bit more juice.
Oppo Find X3 Lite conclusion
The Oppo Find X3 Lite is a decent phone by all means, with a good battery, mind-blowing fast-charging, strong processing performance, and an appealing design – while the camera and the screen are satisfactory without ever being stunning.
It’s a decent all-round mid-ranger, but given how important the camera and the screen are to most people, you might feel a little underwhelmed with what you get for your money.
You should buy the Oppo Find X3 Lite if…

You’re looking for a good battery performance
The battery not only offers strong endurance, but it can be recharged incredibly quickly thanks to Oppo’s SuperVOOC system.


You want decent processing power and 5G
The Snapdragon 765G on this phone performs well compared to direct rivals, and it offers 5G connectivity for faster mobile data speeds.

You shouldn’t buy the Oppo Find X3 Lite if…

The screen or the camera are your top priorities
Most people would probably name these as the two most important aspect of a smartphone purchase – unfortunately, the Find X3 Lite doesn’t deliver top bang for your buck in either of these regards.

Verdict




 



Until UK pricing is confirmed, I'll abstain from giving a final rating to the Vivo X60 Pro Plus – but make no mistake, I've been rendered highly impressed by this new flagship. For the camera set-up alone, the X60 Pro Plus is sure to find an audience with photography enthusiasts, but the addition of a bright 120Hz AMOLED display and the super-fast Snapdragon 888 chipset make this a smartphone to be reckoned with.



Pros

One of the best smartphone camera systems
Fast performance
Bright AMOLED display is great for watching content



Cons

One-day battery life
Ridiculous amounts of bloatware pre-installed






Key Specifications

Built-in gimbal for stabilised video recording
Quad-camera setup
4200mAh battery
191g
6.56-inch Super AMOLED display
Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G

In-display fingerprint reader


Vivo has yet to become a household name in the West, but the company’s latest phone, the Vivo X60 Pro Plus, could be the product to fix that.
I’d wager a bet that for a fair number of people reading this review, it may well be the first time they’ve laid eyes on a Vivo smartphone. The Chinese manufacturer managed to make some headlines last year with the Vivo X50 Pro, noteworthy for its inclusion of a physical gimbal within the camera module.
Having gimbal-quality video in the palm of your hand was an incredible feat, something not achieved by other best camera phones, but the feature hasn’t really caught on in the time since. However, far from being dismayed, Vivo has doubled-down in the camera department by partnering with German-brand Zeiss to give the competition a run for their money. Will the X60 Pro Plus be the first phone to truly put Vivo on the map? Let’s take a look.
Vivo X60 Pro Plus price – Still unconfirmed for UK, US and EU
As of yet, the Vivo X60 Pro Plus isn’t on track for a release in the West, and as such no local pricing is currently available. However, we do know that the Pro Plus retails for Rs 69,990 in India and CNY 6,030 in China (roughly £689/$953/€811).

Since the price will play a significant part in how the X60 Pro Plus stands against its competitors, we won’t be offering a review score until localised pricing is made available.
Vivo X60 Pro Plus design and screen – One of the brightest AMOLED displays I’ve seen

120Hz refresh rate ensures everyday scrolling feels smooth
The display is incredibly bright, with a peak of 1300 nits
Vegan leather backing is a great touch

Despite being only a few months into the year, the current best phones have already earned something of a reputation for polarising design. For instance, the OnePlus 9, while stylish enough, is an absolute magnet for fingerprints, and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra has a camera module of tonally garish proportions. By comparison, the X60 Pro Plus is a breath of fresh air.
Not too dissimilar to the Oppo Find X2 Pro, the X60 Pro Plus’s vegan leather backing feels smooth in the hand, while also providing enough grip that you can get by just fine without a case (even though there’s a see-through one included in the box). This texture has a wonderfully lovely feel, and I’d like to see it carried forward to a greater number of device. However, where I feel the X60 Pro Plus really sets the bar is in its gargantuan camera module.
At nearly half the length of the phone itself, the X60’s rear camera module is hefty to say the least. I’ll admit that I actually had to change the way I held the device to avoid smudging the sensors; but there’s still a lot to love here.
The black slab used to house the phone’s four sensors looks like something you’d find on an actual camera, and the Zeiss logo sitting proudly near the top only further hammers home this aesthetic. Even though the words ‘Professional Photography’ are ludicrously etched into the top of the X60 Pro Plus, I have to hand it to Vivo for making a device that invokes all the high-spec tech one might find on a pricey camera.

Flip the phone over and you’ll be greeted with a rather lush 6.56-inch Super AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 1300 nits – much like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, this phone is made for enjoying content on-the-go. There’s also a ‘Smart Switch’ option for keeping the refresh rate variable, depending on the task at hand.
The small front-facing hole-punch camera sits near the centre of the phone’s top bezel, and you’ll barely notice it’s there when streaming a cheeky bit of content. While the X60 Pro Plus is just a tad too big to be used comfortably in one hand, I can’t deny that the aforementioned specs add up to one of the best viewing experiences I’ve ever had on a smartphone.
Vivo X60 Pro Plus camera – Vivo and Zeiss have created something truly special

The ultra-wide camera features a physical gimbal for video stabilisation
The main 50-megapixel sensor features a brilliantly natural bokeh effect
There’s an abundance of control offered up to the user

Following the recent partnership between OnePlus and Hasselblad, the concept of smartphone manufacturers relying on the expertise of well-known camera brands seems to be back in vogue. Until now, the gold standard among the best camera phones has been Huawei’s partnership with Leica, but after having the good sense to cooperate with Zeiss, Vivo may have ushered in a new camera king.
The X60 Pro Plus features no less than four cameras on the rear: a 50-megapixel f/1.6 wide sensor, an 8-megapixel f/3.4 periscope lens with 5X optical zoom, a 32-megapixel f/2.1 telephoto lens and, lastly, a 48-megapixel ultra-wide with – get this – a built-in gimbal. From a photographers point of view, these specs are an absolute dream – and there’s no pointless macro camera to mess things up.

Right from the get-go, it’s easy to see that this partnership is something that Vivo has taken seriously. The X60 Pro Plus includes a range of image-tweaking features to give users greater control, but without making things too complicated – consider it ‘manual lite’. For instance, after taking a portrait shot, I was immediately given the option of tweaking the bokeh effect – not only its prevalence, but also the point of focus within the picture itself.
Portrait mode does a decent job indoors, but it can get overzealous in outdoor settings.
Of course, for those who like a challenge, there is a dedicated ‘pro’ mode that offers up a wider array of manual features. However, the automatic mode on the X60 Pro Plus does such a good job that you’ll probably rarely want to venture elsewhere. Shots can absorb a great deal of light while also adding plenty of natural-looking colour, which to my eyes looks more true to life than what you’d find on images taken with a Google Pixel or Samsung device.
Colours are natural, without looking saturated.
The natural bokeh on the main sensor is fantastic, and a great amount of detail can be picked up in the foreground.
The ultra-wide sensor doesn’t suffer from a drop in quality.
In low-light scenes, the X60 Pro Plus continued to impress. It takes clear inspiration from Google’s Night Sight, but it benefits from the greater detail offered by its more robust sensors. In fact, the main sensor did such a fantastic job of automatically adjusting to suit a night-time setting that the dedicated Night mode wasn’t really required – although it did help in one instance to nab an incredible shot of a star-filled night sky.
In a near pitch-black environment, the X60 Pro Plus was able to make out the stars.
Night mode gets the job done nicely, without feeling too unrealistic.
While more of a computational issue, I did find that the camera’s Portrait mode was a little heavy-handed with the bokeh. After a while, I ended up simply using the standard photo mode for its more realistic use of the effect.
However, the one thing I simply can’t fault is the video recording. Even though Vivo has been using a gimbal system in its smartphones since last year, I still can’t believe that the company has managed to shrink-down this tech to something that fits in your pocket. Prior to testing, the smallest gimbal camera I’d ever used was on the DJI Pocket 2, which is a lot thicker than the slim chassis of the X60 Pro Plus.
Captured footage is as smooth as you’d expect it to be, and while the process of turning is more elegantly achieved with the use of a proper gimbal cameras, this is still one of the best phones for video. It’s also worth pointing out that upon my initial testing, I made the mistake of assuming that the gimbal was part of the main camera (it’s actually the ultra-wide sensor), but the quality was so good for the OIS that I couldn’t immediately determine the difference – it’s right up there with the iPhone 12.
Vivo X60 Pro Plus performance – The high-end hardware is let down by persistent bloatware

The Snapdragon 888 5G chipset can handle whatever you throw at it
There’s a ridiculous amount of bloatware pre-installed on the device
Funtouch OS features a nice amount of customisation

Despite the stellar first impression made by the X60 Pro Plus’ premium build, it did come crashing down for a moment during the set-up process. There’s a considerable amount of bloatware pre-installed on the device – and, bizarrely, you’re given the option to add even more guff during the installation. Unless you want to be bombarded with clickbaity headlines in your notifications, I highly recommend getting rid of as many of the pre-installed apps as you can.
Bloatware aside, Vivo offers its own take on Android with the questionably titled Funtouch OS. If you can get past its name, Funtouch is actually one of the better Android overlays out there, taking what works from the best Android phones while implementing its own unique control panel.
For instance, just as with the Pixel 5, holding down the power button will give you quick access to an array of features including NFC and any connected smart home devices. The Google News feed is also available for catching some of the day’s headlines – although, as always, the experience pails in comparison to Apple News.

Once you head into the settings, however, there’s a good number of fun little features that you can tweak. Specifically, the various animations that appear when using the in-display fingerprint reader, charging and when notifications appear. This might seem like a minor addition, but when the line between most flagships continues to blur, it’s such small changes that become memorable.
This isn’t to say that Funtouch is without its quirks – throughout testing, the X60 Pro Plus has woken up countless times for seemingly no reason, and the fingerprint reader hasn’t been quite as reliable as I’d hoped.
Still, these are fairly minor issues as the phone is powered by the super-fast Snapdragon 888 5G chipset, which, in conjunction with the 120Hz display, makes the X60 Pro Plus feel incredibly responsive in almost all scenarios. Diving into a quick round of PUBG, the frame rate was smooth and the graphics vibrant – there’s very little (if anything) that this phone won’t be able to handle, and you’re covered into the future with 5G compatibility. Running the phone through Geekbench, the X60 Pro Plus emerged with an impressive 1125 single-core score and 3746 for multi-core, blazing past most other handsets.
Vivo X60 Pro Plus battery life – the Achilles heel in an otherwise stellar package

To make the most of the phone’s specs, the battery life should be longer
You can make it safely to the end of the day, but that’s it

Given how much I enjoyed using the X60 Pro Plus’ camera system, I was really hoping that the phone would pack a robust battery to keep things ticking on. Sadly, this isn’t the case. The phone’s 4200mAh unit is just enough to see you to the end of the day, but don’t expect much more than that without seriously cutting back on your daily screen time.

Taking the X60 Pro Plus away from the power supply around 7am, I was able to make it to 11:30pm – after a day of streaming music, recording video and taking pictures, with NFC switched on – with 27% left in the tank.
This test accrued 1hr 46mins of screen-on time, and while that’s probably enough to avoid any panic towards the end of the day, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll ever be able to stretch the X60 Pro Plus into two days of use.
Vivo X60 Pro Plus conclusion
With the X60 Pro Plus, Vivo has truly outdone itself in creating a flagship device that not only takes its competitors to task, but also introduces new features that the competition should look to adopt going forward. Now that gimbal-steady video is available in a smartphone format, it’s hard to imagine going back to the OIS method, and I have no doubt that the X60 Pro Plus will become the smartphone of choice for many mobile filmmakers and photographers.
The two things holding back the Pro Plus are its lacklustre battery life and the considerable bloatware that plagues the device post set-up. At least with the latter, you can always remove a fair chunk of it or move it to the far corners of the app library. But even with these flaws, I sincerely hope that the Vivo X60 Pro Plus sees a Western release – there’s a lot to enjoy here and it would be a real shame for this part of the world to miss out.
You should buy the Vivo X60 Pro Plus if…

You care about stable video
Gimbal technology has been gradually shrinking over the years, but this feels like a huge leap in convenience. To have gimbal-steady video available at a moment’s notice is just brilliant, and I’m hard-pressed to think of a better alternative for shooting quality footage on-the-go.


You want a premium-level camera system
Vivo’s partnership with Zeiss has absolutely paid off, and so many of the shots I took with the X60 Pro Plus forced me to do a double-take. The camera system really is up there with what you’d expect from the likes of Huawei.


You want a stylish flagship
Too many of the latest flagship phones tend to sport Marmite designs, but the X60 Pro Plus skirts around this by having a sophisticated camera bump alongside a chic, vegan leather coating on the rear. It might be a tad understated compared to the Galaxy S21, for example, but it works far better than some of the fingerprint-catching designs of late.

You shouldn’t buy the Vivo X60 Pro Plus if…

You need a two-day battery life
Despite its many flagship features, the X60 Pro Plus’ battery just isn’t powerful enough to take the phone into a second day of use on a single charge. If you need a smartphone with substantial longevity then there are far better options out there.

Verdict


































A good value phone with a strong primary camera and fast charging, but not the strongest all-round Android at under £300. 



Pros
Solid primary cameraSurprisingly effective 3x digital zoomGood battery life

Cons
Plastic rear and sidesThere’s a giant ugly slogan on the backSlow fingerprint scannerWeak secondary cameras

Key Specifications 
Review Price: £279160.6 x 73.9 x 8.1 mm176g6.4-inch 2400 x 1080 OLEDSnapdragon 720G8GB RAM128GB storage108/8/2/2MP rear cameras16MP front camera


The Realme 8 Pro is an affordable phone with a 108MP camera and fast charging. These three factors sum up the appeal here. 
Forget the rest. The price is low, the primary camera is good and the charge speed is excellent. This is very much deserving of its place among the best cheap phones you can buy. 
Other factors are much less remarkable. This means phones like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro and Realme X50 5G will be better buys for many. It doesn’t have advanced extras like a high refresh rate screen, a glass back or 5G either. 
However, this phone sits in a class of Android where value is king. The aim is to make phones like the iPhone 12 and Samsung Galaxy S21 seem a flat-out bad deal. The Realme 8 Pro does just that, and is a solid choice if you want an Android with a mid-size screen at a reasonable price. 
Realme 8 Pro Price and Availability
The Realme 8 Pro was announced in March 2021 and costs £279 (around $380). At this price you might consider the Pixel 4a or Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro instead. Or perhaps Realme’s slightly older, and still great, Realme X50 5G. 
This newer phone doesn’t actually have all that much new 2021 tech to separate it from Realme’s last wave of phones. But very fast charging and a relatively new Samsung sensor should lure at least a few of you away from competitors. 
Realme 8 Pro Design and Screen – Plastic provocation

Plastic back and sides
Deliberately provocative rear design
Not too big 
Slow fingerprint scanner

The Realme 8 Pro is an attention-grabbing phone that can look alluring in photos, if the giant “dare to leap” slogan on the back doesn’t make you want to bring up your lunch. Its finish glints in the light, and the colour gradient — blue to silvery grey here — is pretty.

However, the Realme 8 Pro isn’t quite as impressive in person. This is an all-plastic phone. The textured glass the back tries to emulate is one of the best finishes seen in phones, but you don’t mistake this homage for anything but plastic when you pick it up. 
The Realme 8 Pro’s sides are plastic too, not aluminium. It isn’t as impressive a presence as the Realme X50 5G, one of my personal favourites of the last 12 months, which has a glass back. 
However, the Realme 8 Pro is of a good size and weight. Many affordable phones from value-packed brands like Xiaomi/Redmi and Realme use fairly large screens to offer more overt value per pound. But it means many of them are slightly too large for comfort for some. The Realme 8 Pro’s size is a near-perfect balance. Its screen isn’t small but the frame is not too wide either. 
Realme uses an in-screen fingerprint scanner in the 8 Pro as part of its attempt to wow us with advanced tech at a low price. This is far from the best I’ve tried. It’s slower than those of mid-range and high-end phones, and does tend to fail to recognise your finger/thumb fairly regularly. It’s a bit like stepping back a couple of years to the early days of in-screen scanners. I’d rather have a more reliable side or rear scanner.
The Realme 8 Pro also lacks stereo speakers, which is a shame when Realme has used them in other budget phones. Sound quality is only fair, lacking the extra mid and bass bulk finally trickling down to some sub-£300 phones. 
However, you do get a headphone jack, two SIM slots and space for a microSD card. Most of us probably won’t even need to consider a card as the phone has 128GB storage. The Realme 8 Pro does not have 5G, though, one of the key things to consider. Several phones at a similar price do have it, including the Realme X50 5G.
The Realme 8 Pro has a 6.4-inch OLED screen of 2400 x 1080 pixels. That’s a good size, just slightly smaller than some Oppo and Xiaomi alternatives, and it has high enough pixel density to make everything appear sharp. 

High refresh rate is what it lacks. This is a 60Hz screen. I switched from a 90Hz Android, the Oppo Find X3 Neo, before this review. The downgrade was obvious. Your app drawer doesn’t scroll as smoothly, neither do web pages or your Twitter feed. However, after 24 hours or so it is not something I kept thinking about. 
90Hz and 120Hz refresh rates are nice, but I don’t think they are essential yet, particularly in entry-level phones. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is still at 60Hz, remember. 
The Realme 8 Pro also has the classic benefits of OLED: superb contrast and bold colour. That said, I prefer the phone’s less saturated “gentle” mode, as the vivid one doesn’t look that well calibrated. It has that slightly sickly, ultra-saturated appearance that used to be common in older OLED phones. 
This is backed up by the Display Tester app I sometimes use when reviewing phones. It does not recognise the Realme 8 Pro’s screen as a wide colour gamut display, suggesting the amped-up modes are just that. 
Brightness is the screen’s most notable characteristic. It is one of the cheaper phones I’ve seen that has enough power to deal with very bright days. Realme says it can hit 1000 nits. I measured 530 nits. Not 1000, but still good considering the cost, and this is likely because the peak brightness varies depending on the on-screen content. 
Realme 8 Pro Camera – 108MP camera is a winner, the rest is less strong

Good primary camera
Weak wide and secondary cameras
Surprisingly good 3x zoom mode

The Realme 8 Pro’s camera is the key draw. We are meant to be wowed by the 108 megapixel count of the main sensor, and how the quad-camera array looks just like that of a phone three or four times the cost.

Here’s the reality. The Realme 8 Pro has one good rear camera. The rest are fairly poor. 
These other three are an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 2MP macro and a 2MP depth sensor. Load the camera app and you might guess the Realme 8 Pro has a zoom, as it has 3x and 5x presets. But it doesn’t.
Let’s start with the weaker parts. The macro, like every 2MP macro I have used, is rubbish. While it lets you focus much closer than the main camera, image quality is bad and close-up photos are barely worth taking.
The macro is rubbish
The 2MP depth camera is handy in that it lets you take background blur photos of any subject, not just people. Its depth maps are quite basic, so parts that shouldn’t be blurred are. However, to give credit to Realme, the way it handles the Portrait mode reduces how obvious these errors are in some shots, by softening blur transitions. 
Cheap sensors used to bump a camera up to four rear cameras are the norm in phones like this. That the wide is also quite poor is the only notable disappointment here. 
The Realme 8 Pro’s ultra wide camera is an obvious step down in quality from the main sensor. Its photos are relatively soft, lower in contrast, and fine detail ends up looking mushy, particularly in darker parts of the scene. It’s your standard just-OK budget wide-angle camera.
The ultra wide isn’t great either
Much of this is redeemed by the Realme 8 Pro’s primary camera. It takes clean-looking, detailed shots with good dynamic range. Rich colour and punchy contrast means they can compete with those of phones twice the price. And often don’t look that much worse than high-end phone camera pictures.
But things get a lot better with the main camera


I even like the Realme 8 Pro’s 3x zoom images.  You might think “of course 3x zoom shots look good, it has a 108MP sensor”. But this is a quad bayer array sensor, which means the actual pixel structure is designed for 12MP images. To get anything approaching 108MP output, you need to reverse engineer it. 
And, the real hit, the Realme 8 Pro’s 3x zoom images look far better than a crop of the phone’s 108MP mode. Some real work has been put into the faux zoom here. I wouldn’t be surprised if the phone merges multiple exposures to enhance detail — a technique Google introduced (using OIS, which the 8 Pro doesn’t have) a few years ago. 
It may be a digital zoom, but it’s a pretty damn good one, particularly for a budget phone. 5x is a step too far for the Realme 8 Pro, as fine detail looks like it has been painted in brush strokes, but is still worth trying out. 
We don’t see quite the same great progress in the Realme 8 Pro’s night images. The phone does have a proper night mode, one that takes a couple of seconds to shoot a bunch of frames to make up the final image. We get a significant improvement to brightness and dynamic range, but not the kind of forensic shadow detail boosting of phones, say, twice the price or more.

Video quality is good, with some caveats. The Realme 8 Pro shoots video at up to 4K resolution 30 frames per second. But this is unstabilised (or virtually unstabilised, as I noticed no smoothing) so you may want to drop down to 1080p. Thankfully you get stabilisation at both 30fps and 60fps when using 1080p capture. 
The Realme 8 Pro also has two “ultra stable” modes. One uses the main camera still, and the same field of view as standard stabilisation — suggesting it just uses a different profile that minimises camera movement. The second “max” mode switches to the ultra-wide camera, resulting in a major drop in image quality. Avoid that unless you need powerful stabilisation and a fairly wide field of view. 
The Realme 8 Pro’s selfie camera has a 16-megapixel sensor that uses 4-in-1 pixel binning for better low-light clarity. Photos end up at 16MP resolution regardless, but tend to look like they have about four megapixels’ worth of detail. 
Selfie image quality is solid within that limit, and the Realme 8 Pro uses a lot of dynamic range enhancement to make sure backgrounds don’t look too washed out. 
Performance – Mid-tier performance, pleasant interface

720G processor is solid, but not the best in this class
A pleasant, Google-style interface

The Realme 8 Pro is a 4G phone, and has one of Qualcomm’s 7-series mid-range processors, the Snapdragon 720G. It’s paired with 8GB RAM, as much as you could ask for, and 128GB storage. 
In the past I have said some of these mid-range Snapdragons get you day-to-day performance very similar to top-end processors. The Realme X50 5G was actually one of the first to trade on that appeal. 
The Realme 8 Pro isn’t quite at that level. I noticed a drop in responsiveness, switching from the Oppo Find X3 Neo, which has the older Snapdragon 865 Qualcomm flagship processor. Still, general performance is solid. The one thing that may slow you down slightly is the in-screen fingerprint scanner, which does fail to register your finger/thumb more often than most.

Games run well enough too. The Snapdragon 720G is part of Qualcomm’s gaming series of processors, with slightly better graphics performance. Fortnite plays at 30fps, Medium visuals, with occasional noticeable drops in frame rate that may encourage you to play with the game’s dynamic resolution slider a bit. 
A Snapdragon 765G phone like the Realme X50 5G will perform slightly better, but this sort of gaming ability seems fine given the Realme 8 Pro’s price.  
Realme’s custom Android 11 interface is also one of the more appealing around, as its look and layout are so similar to Google’s Android norm. Icons are round, the app drawer is a simple scroll of icons. Dig into the Realme 8 Pro’s customisation options and you can change the icon shape and size too. 
Smart Assistant is the one notable add-on feature. This is a home screen feed of widgets for things like your step count, calendar events and the weather. It’s inoffensive and customisable. 
Realme 8 Pro Battery life – Fast charging and good stamina is a great combo

Real-world stamina is very good
Excellent charging speed

The Realme 8 Pro also has above average battery life, even if its 4500mAh battery capacity doesn’t sound all that special among affordable Chinese phones, where batteries of 5000mAh and above are common. 
This phone isn’t a two-day charger for me, but it will be for some of you. And I always have a big chunk of charge left by the end of the day – usually between 30% and 40%. 
You can be pretty lazy about how you change the Realme 8 Pro too, as it has 50W fast charging. That is twice the power transfer rate of the Galaxy S21.
It takes you from, for example, 50% charge to 72% in just 10 minutes. Realme calls its charging standard SuperDart, and says it gets you from flat to 50% in 17 minutes. 
Realme 8 Pro Conclusion
A good value phone with a strong primary camera and fast charging, but not the strongest all-round Android at its price. The highlight is the 108MP camera and it is certainly among the best camera phones if you’re looking in the budget market.
The Realme 8 Pro misses out on two of the key pieces of tech that have just come to more affordable phones, including 5G and a high screen refresh rate. This is a 60Hz, 4G phone. You can get 5G or 90/120Hz models at a not-too-dissimilar price. If either of those are important to you, then you’re best of looking elsewhere.
You should buy the Realme 8 Pro if…

You want a good camera in a cheap phone

Eye-catching specs like 108MP cameras should always be approached with caution, but the Realme 8 Pro’s primary camera is genuinely good. It captures great images, for the money, at its 1x view, and even does a decent job of faking a 3x zoom thanks to Realme’s intelligent image processing. 

You want long battery life and a not-too-large phone

The Realme 8 Pro is slightly smaller than some of the high-value alternatives, but does not sacrifice battery life as a result. This is a good combo, as both the shape and longevity add to the phone’s all-round accessibility. 
You shouldn’t buy the Realme 8 Pro if… 

  You care about the very latest tech

The Realme 8 Pro misses out on two of the key pieces of tech that have just come to more affordable phones. These are 5G and a high screen refresh rate. This is a 60Hz, 4G phone. You can get 5G or 90/120Hz models at a not-too-dissimilar price.

Verdict


































The Poco F3 is an excellent phone by most standards, which makes it even better considering its modest price tag. The screen is a gem, offering specs rarely seen even at double the price, and the processor is not only powerful enough to tackle almost any task, but it also packs 5G connectivity, making it that bit more future-proof. 



Pros
Superb screenPowerful processorExcellent value for money

Cons
Decent but not great cameraDisappointing software

Key Specifications
Review Price: £3296.67-inch AMOLED screen Snapdragon 870 5G chipset4520mAh battery6GB RAM128GB storage48-megapixel main camera








The Poco F3 demands your attention if you’re looking for the best screen and processor you can get for a modest sum of money.

With the quality of the best cheap phones and the best mid-range phones improving all the time, it can often be hard for devices at this end of the market to stand out. Thankfully the Poco F3 manages to outperform its price tag in a number of ways.





Poco F3 Design and screen – Striking but smear-susceptible

The shiny rear panel looks very impressive, though can smudge very easily
There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack
No IP certification for water resistance

The glass rear panel of this phone is as reflective as a mirror, and it’s quite stunning when taken out of the box for the first time. 
Of course, with such a glossy sheen it is especially prone to picking up unsightly fingerprint marks after a bit of use. You can suit it up in the included clear plastic case to avoid this problem, but that detracts from the eye-catching gleam.

In more practical terms, the device is large and so may be difficult to manage if you prefer phones that can be used with one hand – but if not then you’ll enjoy the big-screen experience because the display is something remarkable. 
Unfortunately, it hasn’t got an IP rating and audiophiles will be disappointed by the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack. Yes, there is an adapter supplied in the box, but it’s one of those fiddly little things that’s all too easy to mislay.
The screen is one of the standout features of this device. Not only does it have an AMOLED panel, measuring in at a healthy 6.67-inches with a Full HD+ resolution (that’s 2400x1080p), but it also offers a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support, 900 nits typical brightness, and a 360Hz touch sampling rate.

If you find that stunning spec sheet to be undecipherable, then just booting it up for the first time will leave a lasting impression. 
The display is sharp, scrolling is super smooth, and the contrast is excellent, with vibrant and punchy colours that almost pop out of the surface next to the deeper blacks that only AMOLED screens can provide.
All-in-all during my time with the Poco F3, I found the display touches flagship-level performance; you’d usually have to spend twice as much money to get one this good. 
Poco F3 Performance – 5G connectivity and near-flagship capabilities

Excellent performance from the processor
5G-compatible, for faster-than-ever mobile data speeds
Again, it’s hard to find any competitors who come close at this price point

Fortunately for bargain buyers, the display is not the only specification that can hold its own among the very best smartphones. This device boasts a Snapdragon 870 chipset, which is near the top of the tree when it comes to Qualcomm’s smartphone silicone, and the processor certainly makes its presence felt.
Everyday tasks are completed easily, with no signs of lag, slowdown, or crashes. When switching between apps or running animations there are no hold-ups, and you can multi-task between apps very comfortably (even the base model has 6GB of RAM)
If the 120Hz refresh rate and 360Hz touch sampling rate have halfway convinced gamers to buy this device then the chipset should fully win them over, as I found it can run demanding games with no problems at all.

Moreover, the 5G modem means that it can access the very latest mobile data standard, not only giving you superfast internet when you’re away from the Wi-Fi, but also giving you peace of mind that it should last you for some years to come without falling too far behind newer models.
As for the software, the MiUI 12 interface isn’t my favourite skin for Android. Not only are lots of apps pre-installed, clogging up space unnecessarily, it also pops up with adverts every now and then, which are irritating and only excusable as a compromise that’s knocked down the price by a few pounds.
Poco F3 Battery life – Not the strongest skill

Fairly large battery capacity
However, it drains quickly if you’ve got the screen on max settings

The Poco F3 has a fairly large battery by any standards and 4520mAh is nothing to sniff at, it’s a healthy capacity for most smartphones. However, given how demanding the screen is, I noticed the juice can get sucked up quite quickly. 
If you’ve got the screen on its highest settings and you’re watching HDR video, or playing an intensive game, then that battery percentage soon ticks down, and that’s not a surprise with such a bright and responsive screen.
You won’t get through much more than a day’s heavy usage, but that will suit most people fine as you would generally plug in your phone to charge at the end of a long day.
I’d advise you to use the default 60Hz option most of the time, and only change it to 120Hz when you’re undertaking an activity that would really benefit from the enhanced refresh rate.
Poco F3 Camera – A pretty standard multi-cam selection

Decent performance from the main sensor
The ultra wide camera lacks detail
Macro camera rarely comes in useful

The camera module is led by a 48-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel telemacro lens. Generally, I found images from the main sensor to be bright and punchy, with decent though not brilliant levels of detail.


Thanks to the camera’s Night Mode option, images taken in low-light conditions do reduce glare and noise quite significantly (though not perfectly), and more colour is restored.

The ultra wide camera was a noticeable step down in detail compared to the main snapper. It’s still good to have the option for capturing larger landscapes, but it’s not on the same level as the others.

Generally I don’t use a macro lens all that often, though the one found on this device is perfectly serviceable, as can be seen in the photo below.

However, note that while the screen and processor are truly exceptional for the price, the same isn’t true of the camera. If that’s your very top priority, it would be worth considering alternatives in the same price bracket, such as the Google Pixel 4a which can compete with the best camera phones around.
Poco F3 Conclusion
The Poco F3 is an excellent phone by most standards and it is made even better by the low price tag. 
The screen is a gem, offering specs rarely seen even at double the price, and the processor is not only powerful enough to tackle almost any task, but it also packs 5G connectivity, making it that bit more future-proof.
While there are a couple of minor disappointments – the camera is acceptable but not awesome, and the software is a bit clunky – these don’t take away from the fact that the Poco F3 is one of the best lower mid-range phones around.
You should buy the Poco F3 if…

You need an excellent screen

If you enjoy playing games or watching videos on your phone, then a great screen like this one only enhances the experience

You want 5G on a budget

5G arrived a couple of years ago and is present now on most flagship handsets. But if you want faster mobile data speeds without having to pay over the odds, this is a good starter.

Performance is a priority

This phone has got an excellent processor that can truly hold its own. If you are a power user, or simply want peace of mind that your smartphone will cope with demanding apps a year or two down the line, this is a good choice.
You shouldn’t buy the Poco F3 if…

Photos are your priority

The camera here is serviceable, but it’s not flagship-rivalling as some of the other specs are. If you mainly use your phone as a camera, you should consider alternative options.

The design is a drawback

Unfortunately, there’s no IP rating for this phone, and it lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack. If either of those things, on top of the overloaded and advert-supporting software annoy you, then you might want to find something more practical.

Verdict





























 



The Oppo Find X3 Neo is a worthy alternative to the OnePlus 9 if you value camera zoom and a high-quality build over hardware upgrades that you’d be hard-pressed to notice in reality




Pros

Versatile camera
Slim glass and metal design
Super-fast charging



Cons

Uses last year’s top processor
No water-resistance rating or wireless charging
Pointless macro camera






Key Specifications

Review Price: £699
90Hz OLED screen
Snapdragon 865
65W charging
256GB storage
12GB RAM



The Oppo Find X3 Neo probably won’t get the attention it deserves. It sits one step below the Oppo Find X3 Pro, and sells for hundreds of pounds less. 
However, instead of limiting features and design elements, Oppo has chosen to use some slightly lower-quality hardware instead, which most people are unlikely to notice. 
Despite its price, the Find X3 Neo includes a decent dedicated zoom camera and can shoot excellent low-light photos. It features a high refresh rate OLED screen like many of the best phones around. Unlike the OnePlus 9, it sports a glass and metal design rather than the plastic seen in several unnervingly expensive phones. 
The Oppo Find X3 Neo’s spangly finish is divisive; ColorOS is few folk’s first choice of interface; and the handset comes with last year’s flagship Snapdragon processor at its heart.
Nevetherless, if you want a more affordable high-end phone that doesn’t leave you feeling as if you’ve missed out then the X3 Neo is one of the best mid-range phones around. 
Oppo Find X3 Neo price and availability
The Find X3 Neo costs £699/€799. There’s no USA availability right now, and a straight conversion puts the handset at around $950. You may look at this and think, hmm, that isn’t a great deal when the OnePlus 9 costs £629/€699/$729. However, the Find X3 Neo sits closer to the pricier version of the OnePlus 9 since it comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. 
It does represent a significant jump in price compared to the Find X2 Neo, though, of around £100. 
Oppo Find X3 Neo design and screen – A handset that cuts no corners

Sparkly finishes
Metal and glass, with barely any plastic in sight
Slim 8.7mm depth

We live in a time where phone designs are being downgraded, even on the best Android phones. Screen are getting less curvy, and plastic is becoming more commonplace – on expensive phones, too. 
You won’t find such cuts on the Oppo Find X3 Neo. Its front is curved glass. Its back is curved glass with a finger-charming texture, and the sides are aluminium. There’s a smidgeon of plastic along its top edge, but you’re unlikely to touch that part of the device – and it’s coloured, so becomes part of the visual aesthetic of the phone. 
This “visual aesthetic” isn’t something that all will appreciate, however. I have the off-white version of the Oppo Find X3 Neo, and it’s the sort of phone you might develop if you took a OnePlus 9 Pro and focus-grouped it with a bunch of 8-year-olds. 

Viewed from the right angle, the matte finish fires a rainbow of colours off its back. Oranges and blues cascade into each other, turning to greens and purples at a more extreme angle. It’s sparkly. It’s bold. And it may not be what you expect having seen images of the handset online. 
The Oppo Find X3 Neo looks similar to a OnePlus, minus the classy reserve of those phones. I don’t hate it, but I strongly suggest you consider if this is what you want. The darker version of the Neo also has a sparkly finish, minus the rainbow lightshow. 
The Find X3 Neo also lacks a water-resistance rating, although this shouldn’t be a surprise at this price. 
I have no other complaints about the Oppo Find X3 Neo’s outer hardware. The combination of the curve of the front screen and aluminium sides feels lovely – a clear cut above the OnePlus 9. Its 72.5mm width shouldn’t be a stretch for most hands accustomed to today’s sizeable devices, and the in-screen fingerprint scanner is fast. 
The Oppo Find X3 Neo speakers, too, are solid. There are two: one sits along the bottom edge of the handset, and you’ll find the other above the display. They aren’t quite as loud and beefy as those on the OnePlus 9 Pro – podcasts may struggle to compete with the sound of a kettle boiling 30cm away – but they’re punchy. 
Oppo has chosen to include a 6.55-inch OLED on the Find X3 Neo. It has a 2400 x 1080 pixel screen, not the 1440p one found on the Find X3; and it has a 90Hz refresh rate, not the 120Hz of the Find X3 and the OnePlus 9 Pro.

Theoretically, this should result in a slightly less-smooth scrolling motion than seen with the OnePlus 9, which also has a 120Hz display. However, I’ve noticed slight motion trails when scrolling black text on a white background. Nevertheless, it’s still going to scroll smoother than an iPhone 12 Pro Max. 
Colour is designed to match the rich DCI-P3 colour standard, so tones look vivid. 
Plus, the Find X3 Neo includes the feature that I’ve found makes the most difference when switching from a lower-mid range phone to a higher mid-range phone such as this: a backlight booster. This ramps up the brightness to ~1100 nits when the phone senses it is in more dazzling environments.
The feature proves a godsend if you’re shooting photos on a bright day; the preview image simply isn’t that clear on lower-end screens that have roughly half the peak brightness. 
Oppo Find X3 Neo camera – A match for the OnePlus 9 series?

Wide/main/zoom combo is great for a mid-range priced phone
Takes okay zoomed images at up to 5x
Poor macro

The Oppo Find X3 Neo has four cameras, three of which are well worth using. The fourth is a 2-megapixel macro that takes poor photos and which seems to have been included here primarily to make up the numbers.

The main camera benefits from a rather lovely 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor. OnePlus uses this same sensor in the 9 Pro’s ultra-wide camera, which would usually be a red flag as secondary cameras tend to be of lower overall quality. But Oppo also employs the IMX766 for the main and wide cameras in the more expensive Find X3 Pro. Clearly, this is no junk sensor. 
The Oppo Find X3 Neo also includes a 16-megapixel wide and a 2x zoom, which uses a 13-megapixel Samsung sensor. 
I carried out much of my testing before looking into the Find X3 Neo’s tech specs, to evaluate its photos without being swayed by the hardware. 
The camera app here presents as if it has a periscope zoom. There are 2x and 5x zoom presets, and all of my favourite photos are 5x shots. 
It’s counterintuitive, since in this mode, the Oppo Find X3 Neo uses a “hybrid” crop of the 2x zoom. Image quality only just holds up at 5x, but the phone uses a tailored image-processing profile that makes photos look completely different to a manual crop of the 2x zoom. 


This is one of the better hybrid zoom modes I’ve seen in a mid-range phone. However, in certain lighting conditions the Find X3 Neo seems to revert to using a crop of the primary sensor even at 5x, resulting in weird-looking oversharpened images. And, at times, there’s significant purple fringing at 5x. 
I wish the Oppo Find X3 Neo had a true 5x periscope zoom, but that would have been a big ask at this price. Nevertheless, I have a lot of time for this 5x feature, warts and all. 
The Oppo Find X3 Neo primary camera captures lovely images at 1x, with a tendency towards a warm colour cast. The OnePlus 9 Pro’s colour accuracy is better than the Find X3 Neo much of the time, but this phone didn’t take any shots where I questioned the reasons that such colour tone decisions were made.


Its 16-megapixel wide camera isn’t at the same level as the OnePlus 9’s, but it’s sharper than the iPhone 12’s. 
I like Oppo’s approach here. It has spread its budget to offer you an impressive main camera and both a good wide and zoom, rather than leaving out any bonus focal lengths. And it means you can have more fun taking pictures with the Oppo Find X3 Neo than you can with a OnePlus 9. Fun matters, right?
The one area that I think Oppo could have improved without blowing the budget is shadow detail retrieval in HDR photos. Like every good phone, the Find X3 Neo uses clever techniques to lift the shadows when you shoot an image with, say, a bright but cloudy sky in the scene. But the OnePlus 9 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 seem to do a far better job at brightening a foreground dulled by powerful highlights in the sky. After taking a look at a few underexposed-looking foregrounds in Photoshop, I think Oppo could have pushed the shadows a little further. 
Strangely, things flip with the selfie camera. The Oppo Find X3 Pro will apply masses of HDR processing to selfies, if required. You can shoot indoors with a background of a much brighter window and the phone will handle it just fine. However, actual image quality of the front camera is just okay. The Oppo Find X3 Neo tends to leave facial details looking soft in compromised lighting compared to the best sub-£1000 phones. 
However, the Night mode is effective. This can be used in all four fields of view with the rear cameras, and the selfie camera. 
The Oppo Find X3 Neo doesn’t have a perfect camera array, then, but I commend the choices Oppo has made. It maxes-out on the kind of photos you can take, and features such as the Night mode help to mask the slight compromises in hardware at £700, rather than over £1000. 
There’s no 8K video mode here, but the Oppo Find X3 Neo offers good-quality stabilised 4K video at up to 60fps. You may want to stick to 4K/30, since this seems to result in better images if you switch to a zoomed-in field of view mid-shoot. I’d guess this is because the zoom camera can’t actually capture 4K/60, so the phone uses a basic crop of the main sensor instead. 
Colour is oversaturated in 4K videos and stabilisation isn’t perfect. However, the Oppo Find X3 Neo does have an Ultra Stable mode, which crops into the view a little more and drops the resolution to 1080p. Curiously, this mode also fixes 4K video’s oversaturated colour. 
Standard 1080p doesn’t suffer from oversaturation. My best guess is this is the result of a software bug in 4K video that causes Oppo’s AI Highlight mode to switch on, whether you want it or not. And judging by my results, you don’t. Once this is fixed, the Oppo Find X3 Neo should be a great 4K video shooter. 
Oppo Find X3 Neo software and performance – Not the latest internals, but still powerful

Last year’s Snapdragon 865, but still powerful
Generous storage and RAM (256GB/12GB)
ColorOS is not the most desirable interface

Oppo also makes a smart compromise when it comes to the Find X3 Neo’s processor. It includes the Snapdragon 865 CPU rather than the latest Snapdragon 888. 
This is a much better choice than dropping to one of Qualcomm’s 7-series chipsets, which would make the Oppo Find X3 Neo appear a poor deal. 
The company could have used the new Snapdragon 870, which seems more desirable since it’s a newer chip – but the difference between the two is so slight it isn’t worth worrying about. 
High-end games such as Fortnite run well, although that game won’t let you use the 60fps mode available to phones with the Snapdragon 888, and other recent top-end chipsets. I don’t believe the use of the older Snapdragon will put off the majority. It remains a powerful processor, much more so than a true mid-range 7-series chip. 
The allocation of 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM is generous, and means the phone costs less than the OnePlus 9, which is £729 once you have made the jump to that amount of storage. 

The Oppo Find X3 Neo’s ColorOS software is something to consider, though. This is Oppo’s Android skin, and it isn’t the slickest-looking one around; it isn’t as attractive as OnePlus’s OxygenOS or Samsung’s take. 
There’s plenty of customisation on offer, though. You can switch the Oppo Find X3 Neo’s icon shapes, the size of them and the size of the graphic inside. This lets you alter ColorOS’s character quite dramatically. But you can’t change the fundamental appearance of the app menu, which doesn’t have the coherent style of the best. 
Is ColorOS enough of a reason to discount this handset if you’re impressed by the rest of the offering? I don’t think so. You’ll become accustomed to the look within a day or so, and the system layout is much like Google’s default. You flick up from the screen to access the app menu and there are far fewer bloaty apps here than you’d find on a Samsung Galaxy phone. 
Oppo also provides an option to switch to a style that has no app drawer at all. This is the default, which is perhaps the reason ColorOS doesn’t have the most stylish app page going. 
Oppo Find X3 Neo battery life – It will get you through the day

Solid one-day battery life
Super-fast charging
No wireless charging

The Oppo Find X3 Neo features a 4500mAh battery, which is the sort of capacity you’d find in ultra-thin phones whose designs wouldn’t be able to accommodate a 5000mAh capacity unit or more. 
I don’t consider this an ultra-long-lasting phone; it will need to be charged every day. Through testing, and on busy days in particular, I haven’t tended to see a huge amount of charge left by the time I plug it in before bed. 
However, I does last longer than either the OnePlus 9 or OnePlus 9 Pro. This could be down to a different, more restrictive, approach to handling background processes. Or, it could be that the 90Hz screen is a little less power-hungry.

The end result is the identical to what I see in virtually every flagship-style handset. You certainly won’t see the two-day stamina of lower-end devices such as the Redmi Note 10 Pro, but most people will probably be satisfied. 
Charging speed is fantastic, too, thanks to the 65W charger and use of two battery cells, charged concurrently. A 10-minute charge (starting at 39% battery) added 37% to the battery and a full charge from flat took under 40 minutes. 
There’s no wireless charging support, however, which may put off some.
Oppo Find X3 Neo conclusion
The Oppo Find X3 Neo is a worthy alternative to the OnePlus 9 if you value camera zoom and high-quality build over hardware upgrades that you’d be hard-pressed to notice in reality.
You should buy the Oppo Find X3 Neo if…

You want an affordable high-end phone with a wide spread of features
The Oppo Find X3 Neo is a bit like the OnePlus 9’s cousin. It doesn’t have that phone’s new top-end processor or 120Hz refresh rate, but it does have a proper zoom camera and a much fancier design with a curved-glass front and metal sides. You get bonuses you’ll notice day-to-day, and small cuts you probably won’t. 

You should not buy the Oppo Find X3 Neo if…

You hate sparkles
The Oppo Find X3 Neo comes in two colours, black and a sort-of pearlescent rainbow. Both use matte glass on the rear, and are very sparkly. It’s a bold look that won’t be for everyone. 


The latest top-end CPU is a must
You get last year’s Snapdragon 865 here. Noticeable performance differences between this and the new Snapdragon 888 are slight, but you can get the OnePlus 9 for similar money if you’d rather have extra power over the Oppo’s particular strengths in camera zoom and build quality.

Verdict


































The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is an easy recommendation if you’re not bowled over by the flashier flagships and their high prices.



Pros
Great screenLong battery lifeYears of supportOIS is welcome

Cons
Design is a bit basicSecondary cameras aren’t good

Key Specifications
Review Price: £3996.5-inch 120Hz OLEDSnapdragon 750G6 or 8GB RAMIP674 x rear cameras32MP selfie cameraOne UI 3.0


The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is the latest member of the supremely popular A series family of devices and it’s hard to knock for the price.
While the Samsung Galaxy S21 and its S series siblings get all the hype, it’s really the A series that gets the big sales worldwide. There’s a good reason for that too, as these phones tend to compete very well against the other best cheap phones and best mid-range phones we test.
The A52 5G is the latest edition to the line and it’s a great choice if you just want a cheaper device that plays games well, takes good photos and doesn’t run out of battery in a few hours.
Design and Screen – The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G has a basic look and a fantastic display

120Hz OLED is great for the price
Simple design that isn’t shy about being plastic
It has a headphone jack

It’s worth noting right off the bat that while the A52 and A52 5G are similar in name and design. There’s more than just 5G that separates them. The one I have had in my pocket for the last week is the 5G model and all of my views relate to it alone. Keep that in mind when you’re looking for deals in the future.
There’s very little to dislike about the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G’s look. It’s not flashy like the Poco X3 Pro and eschews needless branding for a simple look. It’s not going to turn heads in the same way as the metal and glass-clad Galaxy S21 but it doesn’t feel cheap.

This phone is made of plastic and it isn’t trying to be anything else. This isn’t Samsung trying to pass off plastic as ‘glasstic’ and it’s all the better for it. It feels strong and durable in a way that glass phones don’t and at 189g it’s not too heavy given its overall size.
Unlike the Galaxy S21 series, there’s room for a 3.5mm headphone port on the bottom for your wired cans and it keeps this while still having an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. This is a feature often dismissed on phones at this price-point, especially from Chinese firms like Xiaomi and Oppo, but I think it should be seen as vital at any price.
You’re not going to find me saying the A52 5G is particularly inventive with its styling. It’s basic, with a flat front and back and very few visual flourishes. The camera module isn’t as in-your-face as the S21 and the black coating on my review unit is a smudge magnet even though it’s a matte finish. 
There are a few other colours available, all of which have been given ‘Awesome’ branding by Samsung: blue, white, violet and black.

If you look really close at the seems you can see that this doesn’t have the same high-end finish as higher-priced S series phones. There are small gaps where the plastic meets and over time these might be great places for dust and whatnot to get stuck. You’ll also get a very plasticky, hollow sound when you tap the back. Is that going to put many off buying this? It really shouldn’t.
I’ve been continually impressed with the phone’s 6.5-inch display, even though I moved across from the fantastic OnePlus 9 Pro. That’s big praise for a device with this RRP.
Like the pricier Samsung phones, you’ve got a 120Hz OLED panel (though it will stick at 120Hz, rather than adapt) with an FHD+ (2400 x 1080) resolution. 
That high refresh rate means the screen refreshes twice as often as a 60hz device – let’s use the iPhone 12 as an example – and as a result, everything looks a lot smoother whether you’re scrolling or playing games.
I have often found cheaper devices with more modest chipsets struggle to keep up with these refresh rates, leading to random stuttering and slow-down. That’s not the case here and I haven’t had any issues with smoothness at all. As I feel like I say in every review; once you’ve tried a 120Hz phone, it’s hard to go back.
I fired up Netflix to give the phone’s display a runout and was impressed with the results. While it seems HDR support is lacking, the OLED tech gives fantastic contrast in dark scenes and Samsung once again impresses with punchy colours. It’s bright too, even when you’re outside.
Pop it next to the S21 and you will see some differences, especially in the range of colours visible. The S21 also gets brighter and is easier to read in direct sunlight. The screen on the A52 5G feels more comparable to the one on the Galaxy S20 FE and considering I am a huge fan of that phone this is no bad thing.
The final trick of the display is the embedded fingerprint scanner. It’s fine and does unlock without much hassle most of the time. However, it required a few attempts to actually get my digit registered and it feels a bit finicky every now and then, especially when used in the rain.
Samsung Galaxy A52 5G Camera – Surprisingly capable multi-sensor setup

64MP main sensor
32MP selfie camera on the front
Generally good performance but there are a few pointless additions

The biggest differentiator between the cheaper phones and the best phones is the camera. The Pixel 4a remains the only true mid-range phone that can compete with the best camera phones around and if you want a truly great Samsung shooter that’s reliable in all conditions you’ll want to pay more.
With that being said, I have enjoyed using the A52 5G and I have little criticism when it comes to daylight or even evening photos.
On the back you’ll find four cameras, but only two of them are worth using. There’s a main 64MP sensor with OIS that’ll capture 16MP images and an ultra wide 12MP sensor. The other two comprise a 5MP macro and a depth sensor.
Colours are punchy
Well lit shots look good

I can only imagine the addition of these latter two cameras is for marketing and there’s some telling research that implies more people will buy a phone that has four cameras over two. The macro camera is useless and the depth sensor has no obvious benefit to my eye.
The addition of OIS (optical image stabilisation) is the big one here and it helps out no end with low-light shots. Samsung’s scene optimiser does a good job too, taking some of the heavy lifting away from the sensor. 
The 16-megapixel pictures here might not match those taken from the S21 in anything but ideal lighting, but they’re good. Colours are nice without looking garish, shadow detail is strong and you can even capture some good photos in low-light – as long as movement is kept to a minimum.
The ultra wide camera gives you some versatility
The zoom skills are quite poor
The ultra wide camera is ok and a ‘nice to have’ addition that adds a bit of variety. It’s a little lighter on detail and the colours aren’t as pleasing as the main sensor. The only zoom here is the digital kind, where the camera crops into images taken from that 64MP camera. Results are mushy and lack detail and probably should only be used sparingly.
Flip the phone over the 32MP selfie camera again feels very mid-range. Skin tones aren’t the best and I think many will be fooled into thinking all those megapixels will do a good job.
Video tops out at 4K 30fps. You can also capture 120fps footage at 1080p. The footage looks ok and the stabilisation works well – just don’t expect too much.
The final word on this camera is that it is good for shooting daylight and some low-light snaps. If you pay more you get more versatility with additional focal lengths, superior secondary sensors and better colour profiles.
Samsung Galaxy A52 5G Performance – All you need

Capable Snapdragon chipset with 5G
Expandable storage
Up to 8GB RAM and 256GB storage

Wherever you buy the A52 5G you’ll find a Qualcomm chip under-the-hood, rather than Samsung’s own Exynos alternative. 
The Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G chip used here is supremely capable for a phone at this price and for most people it should offer enough grunt.
Throughout my week with the phone I didn’t run into any issues with my usual selection of apps and I was surprised by how capable this phone is for gaming. 
Graphically intense titles, I used Genshin Impact as a test, run well and they’re perfectly playable. Yes, pop it next to the Galaxy S21 and you’ll be met with a couple more dropped frames and slower load times – but this phone is far cheaper and the results aren’t that far apart.
There are even some areas where the A52 5G beats out the S21, like the Micro SD card slot for beefier storage expansion. It seems odd that features like this, and the headphone jack, are now becoming far more associated with cheaper phones.
You can notice the Galaxy A52 5G’s cheaper price in certain performance areas. The vibration motor, for instance, is harsh and shrill. If the phone was on a table and rang, the noise it sent out was far from pleasant. The speakers too are merely fine, and the microphones pick up a lot more wind than I would expect on calls.
The software is pretty much the same across the whole Samsung line
Samsung’s software will be familiar if you’re upgrading from another A series device and it gets the job done. I don’t personally love the look of One UI, but it is full of features including excellent battery saving modes and lots of customisation options. It’s also great if you have other Samsung gear, as it pairs smoothly with the Buds Pro, Smart Tag and other accessories.
I do have to praise Samsung for its promise of four years of security updates, something barely seen at all at this end of the market. It’s also one of the most bug-free software experiences you’ll find, more than so than even the Oppo Find X3 Pro and OnePlus 9.
Battery Life – Big battery but no wireless charging

4500mAh cell offers good endurance
15w charger bundled

I was a little wary that in light of the phone’s 120Hz display, endurance might be a weak point here, but, thankfully It is not.
I’ve been using the Galaxy A52 5G as my main phone for the past week and I have been easily averaging seven hours of screen on time. That will get even the heaviest of user through the day and the average should go nearly two days between charges.
This is with the 120Hz mode enabled and brightness consistently pushed to the higher-end of its maximum setting.
Where the battery does struggle a little more than flagships with more efficient chipsets is when you’re gaming. I found the battery drained in various titles a lot faster than on the S21 I was using as a comparison.
The phone comes with a 15w charger (and supports up to 25w) however I wasn’t provided with an official charger for the review. I juiced it up with a regular 25w Samsung brick and managed to get 50% in roughly 35 minutes. There is no wireless charging.
Samsung Galaxy A52 5G Conclusion
The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is an easy recommendation if you’re not bowled over by the flashier flagships and their high prices. 
It has a good camera, snappy 5G chipset and a lovely 120Hz display. There is competition though, with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro lacking 5G but offering a great camera at £100 less and the Pixel 4a coming in a much smaller size.
You should buy the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G if…

An affordable phone is key

The price here is great, especially when you consider what’s on offer. Getting a Samsung 120Hz OLED without paying more is welcome and if you’re familiar with the Samsung UI you’ll feel at home.

You want big battery life

I achieved some impressive battery stats with the A52 5G, getting through a day with ease and well into day two with more moderate use. There’s a charger in the box too.

You want 5G

5G isn’t completely common at this price, so if you want some faster data speeds this is a good choice.
You shouldn’t buy the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G if…

You like flashy phones

The Galaxy A52 5G isn’t a particularly standout phone for its design. It’s boxy, basic and functional. Something like the Redmi Note 10 Pro and even the Poco X3 Pro offer more visual flair.

Verdict




























 



You can’t argue with the value Motorola offers: the phone packs power and accessories at a reasonable price. Some risks have paid off, with the dock being a useful addition, albeit a clunky one. That said, with its hit and miss camera and an immature, chunky design it has fallen a bit flat.






Pros

Powerful for the price
Accessories included
Clean Android interface



Cons

Chunky design and very tall
Immature design
Underwhelming camera performance






Key Specifications

Review Price: £449
Snapdragon 870
90Hz display
Ready For software
Quad camera on the back



The £450/$500 price is the awkward middle child of smartphones, and that’s precisely where the Motorola Moto G100 sits — not quite budget or high-end. 
On the one hand, the G100 heralds from a long line of affordable gems, with the original Moto Gs virtually defining the ‘budget smartphone that doesn’t fall to bits’ category. And in recent times, the Moto G8 and Moto G Pro have successfully built on the OG’s legacy.
With the Moto G100, Motorola’s doing something different in an effort to churn out the best Android phone. There are obvious wins out of the gate: it packs an almost flagship chipset, and ships with a fancy dock, which when hooked up to the phone and a TV or monitor, projects a new ‘Ready For’ UI to a big screen. 
I do admire Motorola’s vision. The G100 is doing something different from the cookie-cutter cost-effective competition. That said, it costs more than other Moto Gs, so has a harder time justifying some Moto G traits.
Moto G100 pricing and release date
Motorola’s Moto G100 is being launched in Europe from a range of retailers, including Amazon and Motorola.com. No US availability has been announced at launch.
The phone is available in two colours, Iridescent Ocean and Iridescent Sky, though it is unclear whether there will be regional exclusivity for either colour. 
Shipping with one RAM/storage combination in the UK — the can be picked up with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, and ships with the dock and HDMI to USB-C cable for £449.99. The phone’s 20W wired charger is also in the box. 
Motorola Moto G100 design and screen — A 90Hz holographic handful

Heavily stylized plastic build 
Tall and chunky
Ships with a case in box

Who’s the Moto G100 made for? Based on its design, unicorns and folks who don’t mind a bit of glisten and sparkle. The chunky plastic phone looks seriously fun on the one hand, changing colour as it grabs light from different angles — is it purple? Is it blue? Who knows.

That said, it definitely doesn’t look or feel sleek. With a trademark Moto G-series chunk, it’s 9.7mm thick, exceptionally tall at 168.4mm (taller than a 163.3mm iPhone 12 Pro Max), and its matte, holographic plastic back screams 80s shellsuit fantasy.
Don’t get me wrong; I don’t hate fun, and I don’t have an issue with Moto G100 looking a bit zany. At the price though, between its heft and styling, I am just not entirely sure who the Moto G100 is made for.
Dotted around the phone, you’ll find a Google Assistant button to the left, a USB-C port and headphone port at the base, and on the right is a volume rocker, below which sits a fingerprint scanner/power button combo. Around the back, adorned by all that shimmery plastic is a stepped camera bump and a Motorola insignia. 
The phone is curved on all sides, edges and corners, so it feels soft in-hand. Even the flat-screen sports 2.5D glass, so there’s nothing jarring or angular digging into your palm when using the G100. Its finish also does a better job of hiding fingerprints than the high-gloss competition, like the Poco F3, for example.

Despite a few wins though, I do wish the Moto G100 was more distinguished. It looks like an overgrown Captain Planet when set against the Batman of Motorola’s line-up: the cheaper, less powerful Motorola Edge, which can be had for £399.99 on Motorola.co.uk. Even the Edge’s screen puts that of the G100 to shame, with its OLED technology and less bezel-heavy frame. 
The G100’s 1080 x 2520 IPS panel isn’t bad by any means. Viewing angles are strong, and it scrolls smoothly at up to 90Hz, while packing HDR10 support. At 6.7 inches and with a 21:9 aspect ratio though, it does make for a very tall experience, mid-range experience, and its peak brightness could be a touch higher in direct sunlight. Set alongside the cheaper Poco F3 and Redmi Note 10 Pro, Motorola’s screen falls flat.
Motorola Moto G100 camera – capable, not a lot more

Mediocre 64MP main sensor
Impressive 16MP ultra-wide plus macro
ToF sensor and depth sensor

Motorola has never wowed with its cameras. The brand has always tended to do a decent job in ideal conditions, especially for the price, but never offer best-in-class imaging in challenging scenes.

Since the 64MP Samsung ISOCELL sensor was introduced to the Moto Gs, including the recently reviewed Moto G30, this good, not great performance is getting a bit predictable. 
The Moto G100 is no exception, but it’s a bit harder to swallow given the phone’s price. 
The 64MP camera at the helm excels in well-lit scenes, though crumbles when the lights go down. It’s a real shame it doesn’t sport optical image stabilisation (OIS), which would have helped things along, but even when compared to some cheaper competition lacking OIS, like the Redmi Note 10 Pro, the G100 falls short.
Bright environments that feed the sensor loads of light can produce beautiful photos, and the phone’s HDR mode is really good, grabbing detail from shadows and boosting them nicely. 
The contrast is a bit high, and photos are noticeably sharpened, which is really visible when you zoom in on them; but they still look good.


As soon as the lights go down, everything gets much muddier. The slightest movement from your subject or your own hand sends the camera into a bit of a blur-frenzy that even oversharpening can’t save. This is the same across both cameras, and is what really lets the G100 down. 


The phone’s ultrawide camera, with its 16MP resolution autofocus and macro capability, is most welcome. 
So many ultra-wide and macro cameras lack autofocus, and Motorola’s decision to combine the two and make it fully featured, like the ultra-wide on the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and other premium camera phones, was the right one. 

Prop it on a surface and it can take a beautifully detailed macro shot. Once again though, it copes especially badly with dim environments, given the fact when switched to macro-mode, it crops into the ultra-wide frame, thereby magnifying handshake.
The macro isn’t great
So while you can get some fantastic shots from the Motorola G100, it definitely isn’t consistent. The inclusion of a time of flight (ToF) sensor, and a depth sensor is a bit superfluous, though the phone’s portrait mode is respectable, and video capture is competitive too. 
The G100 shoots at up to 6K resolution (30fps) with no electronic image stabilisation (EIS), and up to 4K resolution (60fps) with EIS active. 
In the dark, it can’t stack up to better cameras like the OnePlus 9 with its video Nightscape mode, for example, but competes with similarly priced smartphones. 
As for the dual-selfie-camera, the main 16MP, f/2.2 wide-angle and 8MP ultra-wide miss the mark when it comes to capturing flattering skin tones or stacks of detail. They are also relatively unusable in low light without a fill-flash, though do grab a usable selfie in well-lit scenes.
Motorola Moto G100 performance – Powerful performance plus a novelty dock

Snapdragon 870 delivers 2020 flagship-grade power
Clean Android skin
Big-screen experience — Ready For, debuts on G100

The Motorola G100 is very well specced when it comes to power for the price. This power is all thanks to the Snapdragon 870, a new chipset from Qualcomm that’s a 5G variation of the 2020 Snapdragon 865. Throughout my time with the phone I have found it very quick in day-to-day use, which mirrors the results of the synthetic benchmarks I ran.
Despite undercutting the Pixel 5, it achieves a respectable Geekbench single-core score of 955, and a multi-core score of 2824, not far off double the performance of Google’s pricey camera champ.
The phone also sports 128GB storage, a microSD card slot (or a second-SIM slot) and 8GB RAM, so neither storage nor speed should be an issue for most.
The phone runs Android 11, the latest version of Google’s mobile OS, and Motorola has always kept its take on Android respectfully stock. There are Moto flourishes, some illustrations here and there, as well as additional modes, but the core UI experience is in line with Google’s vision.
With a bottom-firing mono speaker that’s easy enough to cover up, the Moto G100’s audio is a bit disappointing — less pricey Moto G devices have packed dual-speakers — but the G100 is still plenty loud. That said, Moto’s vision doesn’t involve you watching your content on the phone itself.
 
Ready For, Motorola’s projected UI experience refers to the ways you can use the Moto G100 on a big screen, by way of either an HDMI cable or a fiddly magnetic dock the phone ships with. Once assembled, it plugs into a TV and power connector, and when the phone is placed on it, a Ready For menu appears.
Whether you want to game, watch content, video call chums or enjoy a desktop UI, Ready For has your back… sometimes. Each instance of Ready For packs a few pitfalls. 
Gaming, for example, requires a controller, which you’ll have to buy separately. Additionally, most Android titles are touch-optimized, and the G100 doesn’t give you an option to map controller keys to on-screen controls, like the Asus ROG Phone 2, for example. Some games work great, but most won’t. 
What about streaming platforms? It’s just as hit and miss. BBC iPlayer, Disney Plus, HBO Max and Netflix worked great. Meanwhile, All4, Amazon Prime Video and Sky Go wouldn’t display on a second display. 
The desktop UI was useful for things like document editing. I wrote a few hundred words of this review on the G100’s Ready For interface with a keyboard and mouse connected over Bluetooth, and it worked just like Samsung’s DeX. With Samsung’s desktop UI not available on non-flagship devices in the G100’s price-range, that makes for a great and unique value add. 

I also found myself using the phone’s unplugged dock around the flat a fair bit, when cooking dinner and watching content or video calling while getting on with something else. When plugged in, it has a fan that keeps your phone cool while powering it up, but even when it isn’t connected, the dock is still useful.
Despite its clunky hardware smacking of Windows Mobile circa 2005, therefore, I can’t argue with the fact the dock adds functionality to the G100 and Motorola isn’t making you fork out an arm and a leg to buy it separately. 
Moto G100 battery life – Big phone, big battery

Hefty cell inside the G100
Charger included

With most of the best phones today rocking roughly 4500mAh of battery capacity, the 5000mAh cell in the Moto G100 is off to a great start on paper. 
It supports Motorola’s 20W Turbo Charging, so 15 minutes powers up the phone up by around 14%, while an hour of charge half fills the tank. 
If you want a full charge, you’ll need to keep the phone hooked up for over two hours. Faster than an iPhone, slower than most other similarly-priced smartphones.
I easily made it through a full day with the G100 using it casually, with a 30-minute episode streaming over Wi-Fi dropping the battery by about 8%.
There’s a headphone jack…
The screen-on time isn’t as impressive as expected, when compared to other smartphones with OLED screens and smaller cells, however, thanks to the sheer capacity of the G100’s battery, it should still last most a day without fail. 
Motorola G100 Conclusion
You can’t argue with the value Motorola offers: the phone packs power and accessories at a reasonable price. Some risks have paid off, with the dock being a useful addition, albeit a clunky one. 
Add to the mix smooth performance when gaming and using the G100 throughout the day, and it was a pleasure to swipe and tap away on. 
That said, with its hit and miss camera and an immature, chunky design it has fallen a bit flat. 
The result is a very niche device that definitely offers value in spades but lacks the refinement of the best mid-range phones from brands like Samsung in the less powerful, much prettier Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, and Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 10 Pro.
You should buy the Moto G100 if:

You’re a giant geek who loves fiddling with accessories

There’s an undeniable geek-factor to the Moto G100’s dock, and when it works, it works really well, opening up working across windows, and enjoying big-screen video and gaming with just your phone and an external display.

You want maximum power for the price and stock(ish) Android

 If you want a 2021 smartphone for gaming, the G100 is a decent option, with ample power to playback Genshin impact on max settings. It’s also one of a handful of powerhouses with a relatively stock Android 11 interface.
You shouldn’t buy the Moto G100 if:

You crave an end-to-end refined experience

The magnetic dock is a bit clumsy and the phone’s clunky holographic styling feels like a prop from an 80s fantasy flick. If you want more refined and modern, opt for the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, or even an iPhone SE 2020. 

You have small hands

 A 21:9 aspect plus a 6.7-inch screen size makes for a massive phone. Add thickness to the mix, and the plastic fantastic Moto G100 misses the mark for anyone with dinky digits.

Verdict


































The OnePlus 9 Pro really is a great phone, comfortably one of the best Android phones around. The screen impresses, performance is snappy and the camera is surprisingly capable (for a OnePlus phone, at least) – even if a slow camera app can make the experience a little frustrating at times.



Pros
Excellent screenFast wired and wireless charging is a dreamOne of the best versions of AndroidImpressive ultra-wide camera

Cons
The camera can be frustratingly slow to openNo great zoom skills and better photos taken elsewhereNot widely available on contract

The OnePlus 9 Pro is the Chinese brand’s latest attempt to build the best phone possible. 
And we’re not talking here about a budget experience. No, OnePlus is delivering a fully fledged handset to take on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus and Oppo Find X3 Pro.
Past experience has taught us that there’s usually a hefty caveat with any OnePlus flagship. For example, the OnePlus 7 Pro lacked an IP rating, while the 8 Pro couldn’t quite compete with the best camera phones. With the OnePlus 9 Pro, do we finally have a no-compromise device?
OnePlus 9 Pro pricing and release date
The OnePlus 9 Pro is being launched fairly widely. It’s available from OnePlus direct in a number of countries, including the United States, Canada and the UK.
However, in the UK availability is scarce if you’re looking to pick up this device on a long-term contract. It seems only Three will be stocking it, which is a shame for such a pricey device.
The Morning Mist and Stellar Black models come with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage at a price of £829/€899/$970, while the Pine Green option with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for £929/€999/$1070. If you want the 50W wireless charger then that will cost an extra £69.95, while the OnePlus Watch is £149.
You’ve also got the OnePlus 9. Our full OnePlus 9 review will fill you in on the cheaper model in the range.
OnePlus 9 Pro design and screen – Flagship view

Adaptive 120Hz can drop as low as 1Hz to save juice
Excellent OLED panel with plenty of detail
Multiple colours and finishes available

Design-wise, the OnePlus 9 Pro isn’t the most exciting phone. It’s perfectly adequate, with its curved front and back, glossy rim and expansive screen covering the front – but it lacks the stand-out style of the Samsung Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12.
Morning Mist
My review unit is the headline Morning Mist version. This handset, at least on the rear, combines heavily glossy and frosted silver finishes that looks good out of the box, but quickly becomes covered in smudges following a few minutes of use. 
If I were buying the phone, my eye would be caught by the Pine Green model, with its moody colour and matte finish. There’s a Stellar Black model too, which has the brand’s once-ubiquitous rough Sandstone finish.
The metal and Gorilla Glass sandwich retains all the bits I’d expect from a flagship device, especially one from OnePlus. The handy alert slider remains, providing quick and tactile access to sound profiles. This is a super-convenient feature, and I can’t understand the reasons that other manufacturers haven’t added it to their devices. The 9 Pro is IP68-rated to survive 1.5m submersion in water for 30 minutes, and the glass rear allows for wireless charging, too.

The only rear design flourish is the camera housing, which prominently displays the Hasselblad branding – which you’ll hear far more about in the camera section further down. The unit comprises two large sensors, with two smaller ones below and a flash.
Flip over the phone and you’ll instantly forget the run-of-the-mill looks. The display here is gorgeous. It’s a 6.7-inch OLED panel, with LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) tech for adjusting the refresh rate to best match the task you’re doing. Looking at an article? It can drop to 1Hz. Watching a film on Netflix? It will bump that up to 24Hz. Playing Fortnite? The screen will push on to its maximum 120Hz.
If you’re moving to a high refresh screen for the first time then you’ll find the change monumental. Plus, this Smart Refresh tech ensures you’re not wasting energy by running it at 120Hz all the time.
There are lots of customisations with the screen
It’s a bright panel (OnePlus claims 1300 nits at its peak), with enough kick to counteract direct use in sunlight or give enough definition to HDR content on Netflix or YouTube. By default, it comes set at 1080p – which you can happily remain with to eke-out more endurance. If you want things sharper then you can push it to 1440p, which is what I’d opt to do.
It’s possible to tweak the colours on the display to your preference, too, either warming them up or cooling things down. I tend to use the DCI-P3 mode, to give everything a warmer, more pleasing look. 
The customisations don’t stop there. You have the usual SDR to HDR booster modes – which, in my opinion, tend to oversaturate – and a mode that will sharpen video in supported apps. If you’re a gamer, the Hyper Touch setting ramps up the syncing speed between the display and the processor to 360Hz for more responsive controls in supported titles such as Call of Duty Mobile. If you play such games then you’ll notice the difference.
It’s a great screen
There are a couple of issues I’ve encountered with the panel, although they are minor. For example, the auto-brightness setting is rubbish, taking far too long to alter. In addition, it often dropped me right down to the lowest brightness setting for no reason, forcing me to manually up it again. I’ve also found the screen picks up many more fingerprints than other Android phones I’ve reviewed, and the curved edges do still heavily reflect light.
Nevertheless, the OnePlus 9 Pro’s screen is certainly up there with the best displays around, and OnePlus has made the panel’s curvature a lot less obvious than on the OnePlus 8 Pro. As a result, the handset is far easier to hold and use. It’s still big, but at less than 200g it’s noticeably lighter than the iPhone 12 Pro Max and Galaxy S21 Ultra I was comparing it to. It would have been nice to see OnePlus offer a smaller version of this phone that doesn’t sacrifice quite as much as the OnePlus 9.
OnePlus Pro 9 Pro camera – Does the Hasselblad partnership pay off?

OnePlus teams up with the Swedish camera brand for colour science
Excellent ultra-wide shots
Some issues with camera speed hamper the experience

OnePlus has teamed up with Hasselblad to deliver the OnePlus 9 Pro’s cameras, plastering the Swedish brand’s name across the module on the rear of the device and in the camera app itself.
You’ve got the Hasselblad orange camera button
Before I get into the camera skills, it’s worth looking at this partnership because, at this stage, the input from Hasselblad is quite minimal – at least that’s what it feels like. While it will likely expand in the future, the current benefits are limited to some Hasselblad influence in the camera app (shutter sound, an orange button, expanded Pro mode) along with colour tuning.
The camera hardware itself isn’t Hasselblad-infused. Instead, you have two main cameras: one wide and one ultra-wide. The wide is a 48-megapixel Sony IMX789 with optical image stabilisation (OIS), an f/1.8 aperture and an equivalent focal length of 23mm.
The ultra-wide is also a Sony sensor, this time a 50-megapixel unit with an f/2.2 aperture and freeform lens to avoid distorted images.
This is a good camera; it’s no longer the weakest part of a OnePlus phone. Whether this is down to Hasselblad or the newer Sony sensors is a mystery, but I’ve taken numerous shots that don’t completely fall down against the best camera phones around
OnePlus said the colour toning should be more natural with the Hasselblad tuning, although I can’t say I’ve really noticed this whether shooting in the standard or Pro mode. Images are a little less saturated than the Oppo Find X3 Pro, but they still display punchy colours that are more vibrant than the actual subject. See the images below for some sample shots taken with the OnePlus 9 Pro.
Colours are nice and, to my eye, pretty accurate. There’s still extra oomph to reds and this comes across more on the phone’s display
Detail here in the fur is great. even if its a little lighter than in real life
 
The ultra-wide camera is super- impressive, however, especially since it foregoes that fish-eye view you see with much of the competition. Ultra-wide shots are crisp though I wish it didn’t vary so much in colour tone to the main sensor.
Ultra wide shot
Regular wide camera shot
The Nightscape low-light shooting mode is present, too – and again, it’s very good for pulling out detail and boosting light in dark shots. The results don’t look very realistic, but that’s to be expected with all the HDR stitching and post-processing that goes on.
Night Scape mode can pull lots of brightness out of dark situations
…but it can often look a little unrealistic as a result, which colours that are far too bright and noisy clouds
Shooting with these two main sensors for more than 10 days now, I don’t feel I’m missing out on a great camera even if it feels like OnePlus hyped this camera up too much to its detriment. This is especially true for daylight shots, which, on the whole, look very good. Note that the camera app is slow, something I delve deeper into in the Performance section below.
If you have the desire to play around with the settings, then the Pro mode is stacked-full of customisations – and you can shoot in RAW 12-bit.
However, this still isn’t a complete camera system. The 8-megapixel telephoto camera is pretty poor. Detail is lost when you’re at 3.3x and the f/2.4 aperture means it struggles to grab light in darker situations. The fourth sensor is merely a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor that aids the main camera.
3.3x Zoom:The zoom is pretty awful
In terms of video, there’s 8K at 30fps, 4K at 30/60/120 and 1080 up to 240fps. Having 4K at 120 is very much welcome if you’re trying to capture some silky-looking b-roll – and although watching back 8K footage is tricky, it looks good on a spec sheet.
OnePlus 9 Pro performance – Snapdragon 888 runs the show

Snapdragon 888 5G chip keeps things running smooth
One of the best Android skins around
Multiple RAM and storage options

If you’ve read any of our other reviews for the best Android phones of the year, then this section will read much like many of them. Like the Oppo Find X3 Pro and Xiaomi Mi 11, the OnePlus 9 Pro packs a Snapdragon 888 chipset with 5G support.
That’s paired with 8GB or 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM (the latter of which I am using here) and 128GB or 256GB UFS 3.1 of storage. Considering there’s no expandable storage, a 512GB option would have been welcome. Nevertheless, I do think that even the most ardent of users will be fine with 256GB.
The OnePlus 9 Pro feels fast and fluid and, aside from some software bugs that I’ll get on to later, it’s an absolute pleasure to use.
This probably doesn’t come as a surprise, though, since I feel that’s been my experience of OnePlus phones in general, even the cheaper OnePlus Nord.
The Hyper Touch gaming feature paired with the 120Hz display even makes the 9 Pro a great gaming device, with any title I tried running flat-out without issue – even with settings maxed out. Your only quibble might be that a flat display is better for gaming than the curved one here. For that, you might like the Asus ROG Phone 5.
My real-world use was reflected in the benchmark scores, too, with the OnePlus 9 Pro pumping out hefty synthetic scores in both Geekbench 5 and 3DMark. Suffice to say, there isn’t a phone out there in the Android space (aside from possibly the Ultimate version of the ROG Phone 5) that can beat the OnePlus 9 Pro in terms of speed.
Call quality and Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6 is supported, but not Wi-Fi 6E) reception are adequate, but the speakers are a little on the weak side. There’s no headphone jack, either.
OnePlus redesigned its OxygenOS software in 2020, moving away from the ‘stock’ look to give it more personality. It still takes most of its cues from Google, and all the big Android 11 features are here. But there’s a definite hint of Samsung’s OneUI here, too, which isn’t a bad thing at all. UI elements are lower on the display to make them easier to use with one hand, and navigation is improved.
There are lots of nice extras with OxygenOS, too, which make it one of my favourite versions of Android. There’s a Reading mode that turns everything black and white; a swip- down menu that can keep all your widgets together; and a heavily customisable always-on display. OnePlus has shown itself to be great with quick Android version updates, too.
OxygenOS isn’t without its issues, however. The camera app is slow, especially when you’re opening it up with a double-tap of the side key. Numerous times I’ve pulled the phone out and missed my shot as the app takes a good couple of seconds to load up.
OnePlus 9 Pro battery life – Warp speed ahead

65W charging remains a dream
Super-fast wireless charging, if you buy the cradle
Charger included in the box

The 4500mAh battery inside the OnePlus 9 Pro isn’t the biggest around, yet it does the job well. Choosing the ‘smaller’ cell allows for a slightly slimmer, lighter phone, and the trade-off here is just about worth it. I’ve managed to get through the day and into the next without hitting 0%, and the ridiculously fast charging will top the device back to 100% in about 35 minutes.
The Smart Refresh display does appear to make a difference. The display doesn’t drain heavily when streaming an episode of Altered Carbon, for example, losing only 6%. This isn’t quite as good as the Galaxy 21 Ultra, but superior to the Oppo Find X3 Pro.
You can, of course, hammer the battery. I noticed that gaming did cause issues – hardly a surprise considering the 120Hz refresh rate. Lowering the screen resolution helps a little; the device managed an extra 30-45 minutes with it set to 1080p.
When you’re running low, the tremendously fast Warp Charge achieves a 0-100% charge in around 30-35 minutes. The same charger can also juice up other devices such as a Nintendo Switch or a laptop up to 45W since it’s USB-C PD-enabled. You’ll need to use that particular charger, though; the speeds aren’t as fast with a third-party option.
This is one of the reasons I doubt OnePlus will ever ditch the boxed charger – it’s just too much of a feature on these phones to make someone buy it separately.
OnePlus is also selling a 50W wireless charger that I’ve been trialling with the phone. This offers a full charge in roughly 45 minutes, if you’re happy to put up with the level of noise it emits.
The OnePlus Warp Wireless Charger
Of course, there are still questions to be asked about the health of batteries that are charged this quickly and what it really does to them in the long-term. 
OnePlus 9 Pro conclusion
The OnePlus 9 Pro really is a great phone; it’s comfortably one of the best Android phones around. The screen is impressive, performance is snappy and the camera is surprisingly capable – even if a slow camera app can make the experience a little frustrating at times.
There aren’t any obvious missing features, possibly aside from a really good zoom camera – and while the design isn’t standout, it’s hardly ugly. My most significant concern is availability, and whether without a strong carrier and network partnerships people will be willing to part with the cash required to buy this device outright.

OnePlus 9 vs OnePlus 9 Pro – Specs Comparison

You should buy the OnePlus 9 Pro if….

You want a great screen
The 120Hz OLED display is big (6.7 inches), bright and sharp. It’s fantastic for HDR content from Netflix and seriously fast and smooth for games.


You hate long charge times
A full charge with the included brick takes around about 30 minutes. If you buy the OnePlus wireless charger, you can get a full charge in about 45 minutes. Impressive stuff.


You’ve not upgraded in a while
I really do think this is an excellent choice if you’ve held off upgrading for a while. You’ll notice the speed improvements in both general performance and the display; it’s just a good all-round choice.

You shouldn’t buy the OnePlus 9 Pro if…

You want a great zoom camera
I wasn’t expecting OnePlus to include a periscope zoom here, especially at the sub £1000 price, but even the ‘telephoto’ camera is pretty poor. To be honest, there are just better camera phones out there.


You don’t want a big phone
The OnePlus 9 Pro isn’t the biggest device around, yet it’s still quite hefty. This isn’t a device for those who really don’t want a large phone.


You’re not looking to spend big
I get it – the OnePlus 9 Pro isn’t as pricey as the Galaxy S21 Ultra or iPhone 12 Pro Max, even though it comes close if you throw the 50W wireless charger into the mix. However, the lack of network availability in the UK means if you don’t want it on Three, you’ll have to pay outright. That was fine when OnePlus sold £600 phones, but it’s harder to stomach with an £829 starting price.

Verdict


































The OnePlus 9 is a fantastic phone, with a screen that’s tailor-made for gamers and people who regularly stream movies on their mobile. However, the fact its screen doesn’t feature a variable refresh rate panel puts it a step behind some rivals when it comes to battery life.



Pros
Well calibrated screen that’s perfect for gamers and movie fansSolid camera with an advanced pro mode for tinkerers Outstanding, future proof performance

Cons
Lack of variable refresh rate means the screen eats up battery in its highest settingCamera’s image processing can be a little heavy handed

The OnePlus 9 is the latest flagship smartphone from the Chinese tech upstart that’s behind the winner of the Trusted Reviews Awards’ best 5G phone category in 2020.
It’s the cheaper option in OnePlus’ 2021 flagship line, sitting below its OnePlus 9 Pro sibling, which features a more advanced variable refresh rate screen and slightly newer rear camera setup.
This puts it squarely in competition with key handsets, including the base iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 and Xiaomi Mi 11. It aims to entice buyers away from those rivals by offering a wealth of custom features, the biggest of which is a new partnership with imaging heavyweight Hasselblad – which OnePlus claims has let it deliver “a giant leap forward in mobile photography”.
After a solid week using the OnePlus 9, I can confirm it’s a great phone. It would be the perfect choice for any mobile gamer and discerning tech aficionado, offering robust performance and a wonderfully well setup screen. The only downside is that niggling flaws in OnePlus’ formula remain, chief among which are the ongoing lack of a formal water-resistance rating and the absence of a variable refresh rate screen, which has a heavy impact on battery life.
OnePlus 9 price and release date
The OnePlus 9 is available now on the OnePlus store in two configurations. The lowest offers 8GB RAM / 128GB storage and retails for £629/$729. The more premium edition features 12GB RAM / 256GB storage and retails for £729/$829. We’re waiting on US prices.
OnePlus 9 design – It feels like a lot of other phones

The OnePlus 9’s frame is built of a custom fibreglass-reinforced polymer
There’s no formal IP water-resistant rating
The smartphone includes a handy switch control on its side

OnePlus describes the 9 as having a “burdenless design”. Taking the phone out of the box, the reality is that the OnePlus 9 immediately feels a lot like all the other flagships I’ve reviewed this year.
Specifically, the device has slightly curved edges that wrap around a Gorilla Glass front and a fiberglass-reinforced polymer rear and frame. The only obvious design feature is the rear camera housing, which juts out of the phone’s top-left side.
The lack of metal and glass is pretty common on phones at this level, with Samsung having opted to do the same with its base Galaxy S21. In hand, the curves a make the OnePlus 9 significantly more comfortable to hold than flatter models such as the Galaxy S21 Plus.
The only feature I’m not sold on is the back’s finish. OnePlus claims it has used a custom manufacturing process to create a “glossy, premium” finish. However, like all glossy back phones, I found my “Winter Mist”-coloured review unit a magnet for fingerprints. Within seconds of having it in my hands, the phone was covered in prints. Thankfully, a case is included in the box.

And I’d recommend any phone buyer use the case – although the device felt well made through testing, its rear offered more flex than expected when pushed down, indicating it might crack easily if dropped.
In addition, OnePlus fails to offer this handset with a formal water or dust resistance IP rating in a bid to keep down costs. As such, you won’t want to use it when caught in the rain.
Aside from these minor issues, the OnePlus 9 ticks all the design boxes I’ve come to expect from a phone at this price.
At the bottom sits a solo USB-C port, which handles the phone’s cabled charging and one of its dual stereo speakers. Under the hood there’s also support for 15 Qi wireless charging.
The in-screen fingerprint scanner performed well during testing; I found it just as responsive and accurate as the one that features in the S21 Plus. The scanner recognised my finger without issue in normal conditions. The only time it struggled was on using it in a minor downpour with wet fingers.
I’m also a big fan of the slider switch control that OnePlus has loaded onto the phone’s right side. This is a shortcut control that lets you set the phone to ring, vibrate and silent profiles. It’s a minor addition, but one I’ve always appreciated, making it quick and easy to switch the phone to silent when watching movies or in a meeting where it would be impolite to start playing with your phone.

OnePlus 9 display – 120Hz makes all the difference

The handset features one of the most customisable screens you’ll find on a phone
A display that’s a perfect fit for mobile gamers
The lack of a variable refresh rate can impact battery life

OnePlus made a big splash in mobile displays when it debuted what, in many people’s minds, was the world’s first mainstream high-refresh-rate mobile phone – the OnePlus 7. Razer actually did this first; it just didn’t make quite as many waves at the time.
Refresh rate is a metric that dictates how many images a screen shows each second. It’s a staple feature in gaming hardware that helps make a screen feel smoother to use and more responsive, which is the reason it’s no surprise the OnePlus 9’s 120Hz “Fluid AMOLED” panel is absolutely great for gaming.
The screen is big enough to game comfortably, and the 120Hz mode makes for a wonderfully smooth experience. This is further aided by the phone’s robust haptic feedback, which I found was noticeably stronger than that of rival devices. The only handset I’ve tested with more rumble recently is the Black Shark 3 Pro, which is bespoke designed for gaming. The only minor downside is that, during testing, I found the phone’s 8.7mm thickness meant I couldn’t fit it into a Razer Kishi controller dock.
However, what really sets the screen apart is that it’s well calibrated and customisable. Out of the box, the AMOLED screen is set to a fairly garish Vibrant mode, which makes colours look punchy but slightly saturated. However, jumping into the phone’s Display Settings menu I was treated to a wealth of customisation options that made it quick and easy to get the neutral profile I wanted.
Switching to the “natural” setting offered a far more realistic colour profile that met my needs. But what really sets the OnePlus screen apart is the ability to set it to target colour gamuts. For non-techies, these are specific colour profiles used by creative professionals such as photographers and cinematographers to guarantee quality. Specifically, they’re a key factor that helps to ensure colours appear on-screen as the creative intended. The DCI-P3 gamut is particularly important for streaming since most movies use it.

Evaluating the screen quality using an X-Rite colorimeter, I found the colour profiles are excellent. Coverage of the sRGB, Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 gamuts is fairly average in the out-of-the-box Wide AMOLED option. However, switching to DCI-P3, coverage is outstanding. The only devices I’ve tested to offer better colour gamut coverage generally come from Apple, which has a long legacy of manufacturing devices for creative professionals. You can see colour gamut coverage across the two profiles in the table below.

DCI-P3 mode

The phone’s entertainment capabilities are further aided by its impressive maximum brightness levels. The screen is HDR 10+ ready, meaning it can operate at a peak brightness in excess of 1100 nits. A nit is a measurement of brightness; a single unit is roughly equivalent to a candle’s flame.
However, it only does so for very short periods when it detects an HDR signal, so that it doesn’t damage the screen. Through testing, I detected a peak 455.28-nit standard operating max brightness, which is atypically high. Most competing flagships operate at 350-ish nits.
This coupled with the deep blacks inherent to an AMOLED panel enabled me to enjoy wonderfully immersive movie-watching experiences. HDR 10+ content in particular looks great, with the deep blacks and 1000-nit-plus peaks looking great. Watching Bosch in HDR, the night-time city scenes really came alive, and I was able to see details that were completely lost on most competing non-HDR phone screens. HDR (high dynamic range) is a standard/technology designed to let creatives capture and display higher quality, more detailed and immersive images and video.
My only issue with the screen is that it still doesn’t feature a variable refresh rate. Unlike its Pro sibling, the OnePlus 9’s screen has to be locked to run at either 60Hz or 120Hz. A variable refresh rate lets a phone manually adjust its setting depending on the task the handset is running. This lets a screen offer the benefits of a higher refresh rate only when it’s required – when gaming, for example – and then dialling the setting down when it isn’t needed to save battery. The tech works a treat on the Galaxy S21 Plus, and I can’t help but wish OnePlus had found a way to get it onto its latest affordable flagship as a result.

OnePlus 9 performance – On par with the Pro model

A powerhouse 5G smartphone that’s more than powerful enough for gamers and creatives
The Oxygen OS Android skin adds a number of optimisations designed to avoid any slowdown

The OnePlus 9 is available in two configurations. The first nets you 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 128GB of storage. The other includes 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage.
Personally, I’d recommend opting for the latter, since it’s far too easy to use up that 128GB allowance if you regularly shoot video or photos in HDR/4K. Both configurations are powered by the blisteringly fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip.
In real-world use, I found the phone wholly capable of running every process I threw at it. Demanding games such as PUBG and CoD Mobile ran at their highest graphical settings with zero issues. The robust cooling system also ensured I never experienced CPU throttling, even when stress-testing the device using 3DMark’s Wildlife benchmark. This is a synthetic test that makes the phone run a cycle of incredibly demanding processes. Throttling is an issue that occurs when a component becomes too hot. Photo editing in Photoshop Express was also fine, even when working on large RAW files.
The phone’s OxygenOS skin, which runs on top of its core Android 11 software, also has a few nifty tricks designed to ensure performance stays top-tier long-term.
The biggest is Turbo boost 3.0, which OnePlus claims lets the phone run “25% more” apps and background processes at once than competing phones. There’s no easy test to confirm this claim, but in my time with the phone, I’ve found it super-capable at multitasking. Overall, I haven’t experienced any performance issues using the OnePlus 9.
The OnePlus 9’s synthetic benchmark scores mirrored my real-world findings, which also generally match the S21 Plus. You can see how the two phones compare in the table below. Geekbench 5 is a CPU-focused benchmark that checks a device’s single and multi-core performance. 3DMark is a GPU-focused testing suite designed to gauge gaming performance. In both tests, a higher score is better.

OnePlus 9 camera – Does the Hasselblad partnership mean anything?

The camera has been co-engineered with photography heavyweight Hasselblad
Only the OnePlus 9 Pro uses the new Sony IM789 sensor
The OnePlus 9 doesn’t have OIS (optical image stabilisation)

OnePlus hasn’t got the best track record when it comes to mobile photography. While previous handsets from the company to pass through Trusted Labs haven’t been terrible, neither have they been frontrunners for the best camera phone title. The issues tend to be around software, with the OnePlus 7T and 8T both having a tendency to over-process shots when we tested them. This led to photos that didn’t look as realistic as the results you’d get when shooting on an iPhone, Pixel or Huawei P-series device.
OnePlus has made a bold move to fix this by partnering with photography powerhouse Hasselblad to “co-engineer” the 9 and 9 Pro’s rear cameras.
The basic 9 model comes with a triple-sensor rear camera that combines a 48-megapixel Sony IMX689 main, 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 ultra-wide and 2-megapixel monochrome units.
You’ll notice there isn’t a telephoto lens, as there is on the competing Galaxy S21 line. This is because, rather than focusing on the camera’s zoom capabilities, OnePlus has opted to push the camera’s ultra-wide sensor and colour accuracy as the primary selling points.
OnePlus claims to have customised the ultra-wide and main sensors to enhance their capabilities in a variety of ways. For starters, the ultra-wide features a curved Freeform Lens that radically reduces noise. OnePlus also has set it so you can use the ultra-wide camera to capture macro photos from distances as close as 4cm.
The main sensor has been tweaked to make it work with the camera’s more advanced Hasselblad Pro shooting mode, which lets you capture huge 12-bit RAW images. RAW is a file type that records significantly more data/information than the more common JPEG file type used by default on most camera phones. It’s a staple requirement that helps professional photographers make more detailed edits and changes.
Testing a camera through a lockdown was never going to be easy, but during my time with the OnePlus 9, I’ve generally been impressed with the rear unit.
Using the Auto setting, the camera offers wonderfully fast shutter and autofocus speeds, to the point I was able to actually capture usable shots of my cats during a particularly animated play-time. Believe it or not, the portrait captured below occurred right after Kenshin had pounced his favourite mouse toy.
The bokeh effect in this portrait is also very good, so long as you don’t massively blow up the image. Bokeh is an effect where the foreground image is in focus, but the background is blurred. Using my cats as ongoing test subjects, I found the mode generally shows good edge detection, although aberrations around their fur were visible on evaluating the images on a laptop screen.
The ultra-wide takes excellent landscape shots, too, offering rich detail and wonderfully wide views of the London skyline that were taken from my flat’s balcony.
My only minor quibble is that, like pretty much every flagship, captured images can come out looking slightly over-processed. This is particularly noticeable when shooting landscapes, where the sky looks over sharpened.
That level of processing can also make the app feel slightly sluggish. There was always a noticeable delay between the image being captured and the thumbnail appearing in the gallery. Switching between modes also felt a little sluggish compared to the experience I’d had using the S21 Plus.
This sluggishness was particularly noticeable in the Hasselblad Pro mode. Accessed in the main camera app, the mode features a UI based on Hasselblad’s own image-processing software. In general, it works in the same way as most Pro modes I’ve tested, letting you manually tweak ISO, exposure time, white balance and the focus area. The more interesting feature is its option to capture 12-bit RAW files.

Low-light performance here is also a step up on OnePlus previous efforts, but it still isn’t best in class – although images are good enough for sharing on social media. However, the lack of OIS (optical image stabilisation) means that noise does creep in if you don’t hold the phone super-steady.
The monochrome sensor does what it says on the tin, letting you take black-and-white stills. Ultimately, though, like all the monochrome phone cameras I test, it quickly stops being used after the novelty factor has worn off.
The same is true of the custom tilt-shift option. This is a weird mode designed to make “the world look like a miniature model”. In use, as far as I can tell, it simply blurs the top and bottom of captured images.

OnePlus 9 battery life – The fast charging is a joy

This handset will last a day of normal use
The OnePlus 9 is one of the fastest charging phones on the market
It supports wireless charging, too

The OnePlus 9 is powered by a 4500mAh battery. This is a fairly standard capacity for a phone of this size, although based on my experience of other 120Hz devices such as the Xiaomi Mi 11, the capacity left me nervous about the OnePlus 9’s longevity.
With the screen set to 120Hz, I found I could comfortably get a full day’s use out of the phone. Regular use entailed frequently checking incoming messages and alerts, making a few video calls during the work day, sporadic music listening, a quick blast on PUBG over lunch, and a few YouTube videos before bed.
More intensive tasks put a much heavier drain on the battery. Streaming video with the handset discharged an average of 7-10% of its charge per hour, which is a smidgeon higher than the 5-6% discharge rate I recorded running the same test on the Galaxy S21 Plus. Gaming in 120Hz, I recorded an average 24% discharge per hour. The figure went up even more when I started streaming games on GeForce Now with a Razer Raiju Bluetooth controller connected. Here, the phone died after less than three and a half hours play.
Thankfully, the phone makes up for its mediocre battery by offering a wealth of custom-charging features. The biggest is its support for Warp Charge 65T. This is OnePlus’ proprietary fast-charging tech. It’s particularly important on the OnePlus 9 because, unlike Samsung and Apple, OnePlus has included a compatible plug in the box. In tests, in topped up the phone from 0-80% in just 15 minutes at the mains.
I’ve generally been taking advantage of the OnePlus 9’s wireless charging support. In the US and UK phones support 15W Qi wireless charging, which lets you top up the charge just by placing the handset on a compatible plate.

OnePlus 9 conclusion
The OnePlus 9 doesn’t revolutionise the flagship phone market in the way that the company’s past handsets have. Nevertheless, it’s still an all-round solid handset that ticks all the right boxes to compete in the top-end phone market. Highlights include a fantastic screen for gaming, powerhouse performance, and the best camera I’ve tested on a OnePlus phone.
You should buy the OnePlus 9 if:

You’re after a gaming phone that doesn’t look like a children’s toyIf you want a phone to play games, but don’t fancy RGB lighting, then the OnePlus 9 is an excellent option. It offers powerhouse performance, a super-fast 120Hz AMOLED screen, and the best haptic “rumble” feedback we’ve experienced on a mainstream handset
You don’t like heavy-handed Android skinsOnePlus OxygenOS is one of the lighter Android skins on the market. It features considerably less bloatware than both Xiaomi and Oppo’s software. This makes the OnePlus 9 a better option for people who prefer a more traditional Android user experience.
You care more about ultra-wide camera performance than zoom photographyThe OnePlus 9’s rear camera aims to offer the best ultra-wide camera performance on the market. In tests, we found it offers brilliant image quality that matches, if not beats its Samsung rival. The only downside is that it does so at the expense of advanced zoom capabilities.

You shouldn’t buy the OnePlus 9 if:

You want best-in-class battery lifeThe OnePlus 9 offers at best average battery life if you use it with the screen set to 120Hz. The lack of a variable refresh rate means it loses excessive amounts of power running intensive tasks such as filming video or playing games. Those looking for best-in-class battery life would be better off looking elsewhere as a result.
You want best-in-class low-light camera performanceThe OnePlus 9’s rear camera is one of the best the company has ever made, having been co-engineered with Hasselblad. But it still falls behind the Huawei P-series, Google Pixel and iPhone 12 family of phones for low-light performance. This is largely down to the lack of OIS, which means noise and blur can creep into shots fairly easily.

Verdict





























 



The Poco X3 Pro is a very capable cheap phone that should be a hit among gamers on a budget, thanks to its punchy processor and strong screen. The camera doesn't reach quite the same giddy heights, but overall it's a very tempting package if you're on a £200 price limit.



Pros

Excellent processor
Very responsive large screen
Great value for money



Cons

Divisive design
Middling camera
Sub-optimal software






Key Specifications

Review Price: £199
6.67-inch LCD display
Snapdragon 860 chipset
6GB RAM/128GB storage
5160mAh battery
48-megapixel main camera


Xiaomi’s sub-brand Poco struck gold a last year with the Pocophone F1, which became a major cult hit thanks to the inclusion of unbelievable specs for the price. The X3 Pro is its attempt to recreate that magic, by pulling the exact same trick.
With a Snapdragon 860 chipset, 120Hz display refresh rate, and a 5160mAh battery — all for less than £200 — it certainly looks promising.
Poco X3 Pro Design — Loud and proud, but practical too

Bold look that you’ll like or loathe
Very practical design, with 3.5mm headphone jack and expandable storage

The Poco X3 Pro is not a subtle smartphone. My review unit was undeniably large. This plus its vivid blue coloring and large brand name emblazoned across the back underneath a chunky camera module, means you’d struggle not to notice it.
That’s not necessarily a bad thing by any means. It’s refreshing to see a device that wants to stand out, rather than blend into, the crowded best Android phone market.

The rear of the handset has matte stripes at the sides with a reflective centrepiece. It’s available in Phantom Black and Metal Bronze as well as the Frost Blue review sample that I have my hands on.
It’s flash, but I like the boldness from a firm that wants to put itself on the map. However, the massive Poco branding is a step too far, even for me.
When it comes to the practical touches, the X3 Pro gets it all right aside from the lack of an IP rating. There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C connector, and expandable storage up to 1TB. A fingerprint sensor is overlaid on the power button at the phone’s side.
Poco X3 Pro Screen — Large and 120Hz

Large 6.67-inch screen
The Full HD+ LCD screen is decent enough, but not flagship standard
120Hz refresh rate and 240Hz touch sampling rate are standout specs

The screen is big, clocking in at 6.67-inches, and it has a slim bezel running around the outside with a centralised holepunch selfie camera at the top.
The size of this handset makes it ideal to watch a few videos or even some full TV episodes – something I have been doing a lot since I started reviewing the phone. If you’re used to a higher-end display then you’ll notice that colours don’t seem to have that same bursting vitality you get with more expensive flagship phone screens. Pop open some content on Netflix on an OLED-toting phone like the £399 Samsung Galaxy A52 and the difference is big.

The resolution is Full HD+ (so a touch taller than 1080p) and it’s got HDR10 support, but it’s LCD so the contrast will never be as good as its OLED counterparts. This is due to AMOED’s ability to display perfect blacks. HDR (high dynamic range) is a standard/technology that makes images and video captured in the right standard look more immersive and dynamic.
The lack of killer contrast offered on LCD is a common compromise you’ll find on every phone this priced and it’s especially forgivable when you consider the phone’s refresh rate. With a 120Hz display refresh rate and a 240Hz touch sampling rate, this device’s display is ultra-responsive and puts many more expensive handsets to shame.
Scrolling is very smooth when the enhanced refresh rate is turned on (you’ll have to switch this on in Settings, as it’s on 60Hz by default to save juice), and the touch sampling rate should give competitive gamers an edge.
Poco X3 Pro Battery Life — The beefy battery has its work cut out

Massive 5160mAh battery capacity
However with 120Hz refresh rate switched on, you won’t get marathon endurance

When it comes to cell capacity, 5160mAh is very generous no matter whether its a cheap phone or an expensive one. And after all, if you’re going to be running a 120Hz display then you’ll want every battery boost you can get.
In my experience, using the phone with 120Hz enabled, the battery life was good and reliable for a day’s usage, but it was not exceptionally enduring. If you think you’ll be getting a couple of days’ heavy usage out of it, you’re probably mistaken.
The phone can be topped up with a 33W charger, which should ensure a rapid recharge. Our review unit was supplied in the box with a two-prong European plug, so we can’t give an official opinion on how the UK plug will perform but Xiaomi has impressed before with its quick charging speeds. There’s no wireless charging.
Poco X3 Pro Performance — Great for gaming

Packs a powerful processor for the price
Everyday tasks and mobile games are done with ease
The MiUI software might take some getting used to

The Snapdragon 860 chipset makes its debut on this handset, and it seems like quite a coup to have a processor this powerful on a budget device.
It doesn’t deliver 5G, but it’s easily good enough to power through daily tasks and I didn’t have any trouble with the numerous mobile games I loaded up. Thought to be based on a flagship processor from previous years, it’s hard to imagine getting better silicon for the price.

From my experience with the phone I never once had a problem with everyday apps, all of them functioning just fine without a hiccup.
When it comes to software, Xiaomi reassures you before you even open the box: “with easy access to the Google apps you use most”. This is to distinguish itself from Huawei, which hasn’t had access to Google Mobiles Services for the last year. Here they’re all available on the full-fat Android 11 package, though you’ll have to deal with the heavy MIUI 12 interface.
As is Xiaomi’s won’t, there’s a ton of unnecessary apps pre-installed, and couple of ads pop up from time to time when you’re using the company’s apps.
I didn’t really find it all that intrusive, and it’s probably worth the trade-off in price, but do bear this in mind if you’re buying this for a child or somebody who might click a bit too impulsively.
Poco X3 Pro Camera — Decent enough, but nothing special

The X3 Pro has a four-sensor camera module
However images were mostly disappointing, lacking vibrancy
Night Mode performs pretty well

The Poco X3 Pro has a hefty camera unit that’s composed of a main 48-megapixel sensor, two 2-megapixel sensors (one for depth, and one for macro images), and an 8-megapixel ultra wide lens. It may look and sound fairly impressive, but how does it perform against the best camera phones?

In clear daylight, I found that images from the main camera had decent but not exceptional levels of detail, but more than anything they just seemed a little washed-out, lacking a “wow factor” to make you take pride in your snaps.

In fact, its performance in dark conditions actually impressed me more, as Night Mode functions relatively well to quieten down blown-out lights and restore more balanced colours to the palette, even if the detail isn’t stunning.

An ultrawide lens is often a useful tool to have just to fit more into your frame, especially if you’re shooting a landscape. The below image of the London Stadium gives a wider shot with a tad of distortion around the edge of the frame, but the image once again lacks any real punch, and detail is noticeably poorer than with the main snapper.

This image of a bridge (below) shows that the ultra wide can really struggle to deal with light in certain conditions, serving up another somewhat anaemic image.

As mentioned, there’s also a 2-megapixel macro sensor. In all honesty, there are few occasions to put this to use at the best of times, but in the spirit of Spring, I chose a daffodil as my subject:

As you can see, detail is severely lacking here (not a surprise with a sensor of such low resolution), and so an option I’d rarely take advantage of anyway seems even less appealing.
Poco X3 Pro Conclusion
The combination of price and specs will turn heads just as much as its gaudy design, and no wonder: for a base price of just £199/$TBC, it’s surprising to see both a high-powered processor and a super smooth screen enhanced to the tune of 120Hz. It’s powerful enough to handle pretty much whatever you need, and the large and responsive display is particularly adept when it comes to mobile gaming.
Some of the specs do somewhat flatter to deceive; the camera, in particular, is not quite as brilliant as it may seem on paper, and I didn’t find the battery to be quite as long-lasting as its 5160mAh capacity would have led me to believe. Yet this is still a very strong overall package for the price.
You should buy the Poco X3 Pro if…

You need a budget phone that packs a punch: If you’ve got a £200 spending limit, you’ll be very hard-pressed to find anything as good as this elsewhere. In particular, the processor and the screen are highly impressive for the price and represent excellent value for money.


You’re a keen mobile gamer: If you love playing games on the go but don’t want to fork out a load of cash for a dedicated gaming phone, this a good cheap alternative thanks to its strong performance and highly responsive, large screen.


Practicality is important to you: This phone retains a 3.5mm headphone jack, a widely-compatible USB-C port, and expandable storage up to 1TB.

You should not buy the Poco X3 Pro if…

The camera is your priority: The X3 Pro’s camera is serviceable, but I found images to be underwhelming and a bit washed-out. That said, it’s hard to find a top-class camera at this price point.


You prefer a subdued style: This device is big, bright, and blue — if you’re more suited to subtlety then it might not be your best bet.


You’re not a fan of Mi software: This phone comes pre-installed with a ton of apps, some of which contain adverts. For many of us it’s worth the trade-off for a lower price point, but others will find it irritating.

Verdict




























 



The Moto G10 is a decent buy for those who want a cheap phone that lasts a long time between charges. Others might be better off spending a little more on alternatives from Realme or Xiaomi. This phone feels a little slow and its main camera often produces drab, oversharpened images.  



Pros

It’s cheap
Has a half-decent (mono) speaker
Two-day battery life



Cons

Poor primary camera image processing
Noticeable performance compromises

Don’t expect miracles with the Moto G10. It feels noticeably slower than the main-line Moto G9 phones, even when you’re simply milling around in Android 11.  
The Moto G10’s cameras are uninspiring, too, especially when compared to some of the other best cheap phones around. Its main sensor takes cold and somewhat dull-looking images most of the time.  
This handset is only really a good option for people who don’t spend much time with their phone, using it just for the basics. And with that in mind, the Moto G10 offers exceptional battery life, easily lasting a full two days for many people.   
Price and availability 
The Moto G10 is Motorola/Lenovo’s main ultra-low-cost phone for early 2021. It costs £129.99/€149/roughly $180. The phone isn’t available in the USA. 
That’s less than the Moto G30, which we mostly like.
Moto G10 design and screen – Everything is just fine

Low-spec display, but the quality is fine
So-so max screen brightness
720p resolution isn’t an issue at this price 

I often talk about budget phones that pull off a pretty good impression of expensive handsets for design and performance. They’re the phones I believe most people should actually buy.   
The Moto G10 belongs to a league below, where the aim isn’t so much as to fool us, but to present a device that isn’t completely boring.  
A wavy plastic rear does the job here. And this isn’t a finish that sits below a flat top layer. The plastic is actually contoured, like the sands of a wind-swept desert.  
At first glance, I wasn’t convinced. But it feels quite nice to the touch since the peaks of these dunes are soft – not sharp, as they may appear in photos. 

However, there’s almost no contouring to the rear fingerprint scanner, making it tricky to find blind. It’s another reason to use the included silicone case, alongside drop protection.   
The fingerprint scanner here is a little slower than most, but otherwise works well. You even get IP52 water-resistance, equivalent to light splash-proofing, which is nice to see at the low price.  
The Moto G10 also surprises for the quality of speaker. At this price, the norm is pretty dreadful thin-sounding units – but this one offers the reasonable volume and tone found in the rest of the Moto range.  
There’s only get one driver at the bottom, though, making the device better for listening to podcasts over watching YouTube videos or playing games. 
The Moto G10 screen measures 6.5 inches across, which is a good size, with a resolution of 1600 x 720 pixels.

The screen here, like almost every panel in a cheap phone, looks good despite the low specs. But compare it to the screen of a phone from a tier or two above, and you’ll notice some differences.  
The Moto G10 doesn’t offer super-deep, rich colour – even if you use its “saturated” mode. Plus, the 720p resolution means you can see a tiny amount of pixellation if you go looking for it.  
With a standard 60Hz refresh rate, the panel here doesn’t appear as smooth as the Realme 6’s 90Hz LCD.  
However, while I get the opportunity to try all kinds of high-end phone displays, there’s only one shortfall that really grates having used the Moto G10 for a couple of weeks. Its maximum brightness of 384 nits.  
I tested this using a colorimeter and an LED array to simulate bright conditions. But the fact that this isn’t the clearest screen outdoors had already become apparent beforehand on several occasions, particularly when taking photos. 
Moto G10 camera – It looks better on paper

Poor processing lets down hardware that looks good on paper 
Stabilised 1080p video 
Soft selfies 

The Moto G10’s camera array looks swish. Four lenses sit in a compact glass rectangle, the sort of design you might have seen in a super-expensive phone just a couple of years ago. 

But the results? I’m not all that impressed by them, and they certainly aren’t comparable to the best camera phones around, even those handsets at this price. 
The main 48-megapixel camera tends to oversharpen images, spitting out overly cool-looking photos that verge on undersaturation. Its processing character is disappointing, leading to “crispy”-looking natural textures and unnatural outlines around objects, caused by all that image sharpening.  
Shots of scenes in mixed lighting also end up looking quite dull, despite the Moto series’ solid HDR algorithms. These brighten up dark areas in an image to bring out greater detail. 


Unusually, the Moto G10’s ultra-wide camera often shoots photos that are appealing, displaying warmer, more vibrant colours and less obvious evidence of sharpening. And this despite the ultra-wide camera having less to work with, since it uses a lower-resolution 12-megapixel sensor that you’d assume is weaker. 

Such borderline ugly processing isn’t the norm for Moto phones. I dug out a 2016 Moto G 4th generation device to see if there was actually any real progress here.  
The Moto G10’s dynamic range is better, as a result of the improvements in HDR processing over five years. But the Moto G4 arguably produces the more natural image, with none of the over-the-top sharpening seen on images taken with the new phone.  
As such, I don’t think it’s necessarily the core camera hardware at fault here, but what the Moto G10 does with it. And most of the criticisms only apply to the phone’s primary camera. The 12-megapixel wide produces smoother images with a more pleasing colour tone. There’s the usual secondary budget camera effect: that ultra-wide images are quite soft and relatively low in detail.
The Moto G10 also has two other cameras. There’s a 2-megapixel macro, which is pretty poor; it doesn’t have the resolution to actually render fine details with the clarity that makes macro photos stand out. The final 2-megapixel sensor is used as a depth aid for background blur in Portrait mode.  
This doesn’t create particularly good depth maps, leading to parts of the background that should be blurred appearing sharp. But it lets you use the Portrait more for any object, not just people.  
The Moto G10 only shoots video at 1080p. Its image quality is uninspiring and the exposure seems to bob up and down awkwardly with some scenes. But it’s at least stabilised, making it somewhat usable.  
Night Vision redeems the Moto G10, slightly. This is the Moto’s low-light photo mode. It takes a few seconds to shoot an image, several more to process it, but it dramatically improves brightness, visibility and dynamic range. Night Vision shots also side-step the sharpening issue of the Auto mode.  
Sure, they’re soft and not a match for the night photos of a good sub-£300 phone such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro, but it’s nice to see Lenovo put Night Vision in a phone at this price.  
Our front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor, and – no surprise here – it takes fairly poor selfies. They look soft and there’s no autofocus.  
The Moto G10 doesn’t have a good camera array, but it’s mostly let down by a fumbled implementation of the main 48-megapixel sensor. Shooting also feels quite sluggish, with some shutter lag and long processing waits if, for example, you shoot a photo in WhatsApp rather than the camera app (where the processing happens in the background).  
The in-app preview image is also dreadfully dark, even with max screen brightness – because, unlike a higher-end phone, the Moto G10 doesn’t estimate what the final image will look like as you compose a shot.   
Moto G10 performance – You get what you pay for

Feels slower than phones only a level up the scale
Can play plenty of games, but Fortnite runs poorly 

The Moto G10’s slow image processing is likely in part the result of the phone’s Snapdragon 460 chipset. This is a low-end Qualcomm chipset with eight cores. Most Moto-series phones use CPUs from the step-up 6-series range.  
It performs well enough in some areas, but not so well in others. Unfortunately, one of the compromises is quite obvious.  
The Moto G10 doesn’t feel all that nimble in Android, around parts of the interface and between the simple apps most of us use daily. 

Slight pauses here and there, the sub-second waits as a blank screen is populated with the Settings menu, are reminders that this is a cheap phone. There’s less of this in the Moto G30, or the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9, which sells at the same price as the Moto G10 nowadays. 
The Moto G10 can play PUBG just fine; Asphalt 9 runs okay at default settings, bar the odd full-on pause that seems to affect almost every genuinely cheap phone when playing this game. ARK: Survival Evolved runs fine, too, without reducing in-game detail to a great degree – in fact, plenty of budget phones don’t support this game at all since it requires support for graphics standard Vulkan API.   
The phone scores 1111 points in Geekbench 5 (248 per core). This may not sound too much lower than the 1300-odd of the Moto G30, but there’s a real-world impact.  
As such, it would be enough to persuade me to perhaps spend a little more, or opt for another brand – although the lag isn’t so infuriating to  make you want to flush your phone down the toilet. The Moto G10 isn’t unbearably slow, it just isn’t hugely responsive. My issue is that you don’t have to pay all that much more for such zip these days.  
Fortnite runs – but don’t bother trying it. Even at the lowest possible setting, dips to single figure frame rates were common, making it more-or-less unplayable unless you want to return to a dead character following a fps dip.   
The Moto G10 could be a worse gaming phone; Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 460 performs better than some entry-level MediaTek chips. But you can get better results by spending just a little more money.  
Moto G10 battery life – The shining star

Two-day use is a reality 
USB-C charging 
Slow 10W charger included 

I’ve shown you, at best, a mixed view of the Moto G10 so far. However, battery life is the best reason to hold on through the issues.  
The Moto G10 comes with a 5000mAh unit – and it works wonders in partnership with the low-power CPU.   
I have frequently been left with 50% battery life by bed time. It’s one of the very best results I’ve seen in the past 12 months.  
Sometimes I find that low-power phones achieve such great battery life figures because poor performance has meant that I use them less. But that isn’t the case with the Moto G10. We’re talking about 50% charge loss after a full 17 hours of normal use.

So, battery life is long – but charging time is slow since you get only a 10W charger in the box. However, this arguably matters less in a phone you probably won’t need to top-up through the day.  
Moto G10 Conclusion 
I often recommend Moto phones. They tend to get the basics right, and are rarely overpriced. You’ll find they consistently feature in both our best phone and best mid-range phone lists. 
The Moto G10 isn’t such a device, though. Despite offering exceptional battery life and a screen that looks pleasant, the Moto G10’s performance compromises are sufficient to warrant spending a little more on the Moto G30 – or switching to the similarly priced Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 instead. Camera image processing leaves a lot to be desired, too.  
You should buy the Moto G10 if…

You want a phone with a two-day battery
The Moto G10’s top feature is that it lasts as long (or longer, in some cases) than phones in the G Power line, which have bigger batteries. Its 5000mAh battery lasts up to two days, and with moderate rather than super-light use.  


You just want a cheap phone for the basics
A low price is the main draw of the Moto G10 – and, unlike some cheap phones, it isn’t completely devoid of personality thanks to its wavy back. The screen leaves a good impression as well, if your expectations aren’t set too high.  

You shouldn’t buy the Moto G10 if…

You expect top performance
The Moto G10 isn’t a hugely powerful phone. Its performance isn’t so bad you’re likely to regret buying it on day one, but Android 11 is noticeably slower than in phones one tier up. And while Fortnite will run, slow-downs mean it isn’t worth the effort.  


You want to take great photos
The Moto G10’s camera array looks good on paper. Who’s going to complain about a 48-megapixel camera at this price? However, the hardware is let down by shoddy processing. Excessive image sharpening and poor colour handing result in below average image quality.

Verdict


































The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro manages to stand out in a crowded budget smartphone field thanks to a stunning 120Hz AMOLED display and a capable 108MP camera. It’s not the prettiest sub-£300 handset on the market, and you’ll have to be prepared to make do without 5G connectivity. Even so, there aren’t many phones on the market today that give you more for your money.

No 5GCamera disappoints in less-than-ideal lighting



The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro is the latest ‘premium budget’ phone from this vibrant sub-brand. It’s a remarkably compelling package for the money.
For £219/$279 then, you’re getting a couple of remarkable components in the shape of a 120Hz AMOLED display and a 108MP camera. 
That’s flagship talk right there. And while Xiaomi has made some inevitable compromises to hit that spec, they’re not as consequential as you might think.
Price and Availability
In the UK, the Note 10 Pro sells for a fantastic £249 for 64GB storage and £249 for 128GB. There’s also a global price of $279.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Design and Screen – Ordinary looks, an extraordinary display

Plastic body is robust yet uninspiring 
Side-mounted fingerprint sensor accurate but awkward to locate
Outstanding 120Hz AMOLED display for the money

If there’s one element of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro package I’m fairly ambivalent about, it’s the way it looks and feels. Xiaomi might have applied pressure to its bottom line with a couple of this phone’s components, but it’s clear to see where the release valve lies.
This isn’t an ugly phone by any means, but it is all but indistinguishable from a number of other phones around this price point. It certainly doesn’t look or feel as good as some of the best phones in the budget space.

While you get Gorilla Glass 5 to the front and glass to the rear, the body of the Redmi Note 10 Pro is pure plastic. If we’re being positive, this no doubt contributes to the phone being able to come in under the magic 200g mark (it weighs 193g), which is far from a given when you’re packing in a huge 5000mAh+ battery.
At 164mm x 76.5mm x 8.1mm, it’s in that just-so range that will neither stick out of nor disappear into a reasonably sized trouser pocket. Without even needing to glance at the respective measurements, I can tell that it’s got roughly the same dimensions as the OnePlus Nord N10 that’s sat on my desk, though the Redmi feels the more solid and classy bit of kit.
One little premium flourish here is the phone’s camera module, which apparently has an ‘Infinity-rainbow’ finish. If this means that there’s a nice shiny metal effect framing the main sensor, then sure. Combined with the two-tiered camera module mounting, it gives the camera a purposeful Pro look that distinguishes it from many cheaper efforts.
Another subtle but welcome flourish is the phone’s flattened out top and bottom edges, which also switch to a less glossy finish than the rounded sides. Not only is it a rare point of visual differentiation for the phone, but it also gives your supporting pinky finger a little extra purchase.  
The right hand edge of the phone contains a fingerprint sensor integrated into the power key. While it’s both fast and accurate, I do take slight issue with its shape and positioning. It’s both smaller and less prominent than the volume rocker just above it, which means it’s harder to find by feel than the more common indented system of the Realme 7 5G and the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite. It also falls a little lower than the right thumb’s natural resting position, which adds to the awkwardness.
I’m glad to see a pair of stereo speakers here. It’s not exactly an unprecedented provision – the Poco X3 NFC does the same for around £200 – but nor is it normal. The presence of a 3.5mm headphone jack is a lot more common, but still welcome. One final surprise is the appearance of an IR blaster on the top edge, which opens up the possibility of controlling your TV and Hi-Fi set-up from your phone.
The front of the phone doesn’t have much in the way of premium design flourishes. You get that generic not-quite-edge-to-edge display that typifies phones at this end of the market, with slightly larger bezels and a proportionally weightier chin. There’s also a plastic frame between the phone’s sides and display, which is a sure sign that this was made to a strict budget.
To be fair, you do get a much smaller hole punch camera notch than you’d ordinarily find on such a cheap phone, mounted right in the middle of the top edge, but Xiaomi somewhat undermines any efforts to make it less obtrusive by giving it a distractingly shiny border.
All that fades away when you consider what’s going on within that somewhat generic frame. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro’s display is an absolute peach.
There’s nothing particularly remarkable about its 6.67-inch size, or its 1080 x 2400 (FHD+) resolution, though both are fine. What really catches the eye is the combination of AMOLED panel technology and a 120Hz refresh rate.

We’ve seen AMOLED screens in cheaper phones before, but the likes of the Vivo Y70 don’t come with 120Hz refresh rates. And we’ve also seen 120Hz refresh rates in affordable phones before, but the likes of the Realme 7 5G and the Xiaomi 10T Lite don’t have vibrant AMOLED panels. 
Such a combination was formerly the preserve of flagship models, so the fact that the Redmi Note 10 Pro gives you the whole package for less than £300 is quite a feat. This is a decent quality AMOLED display too, with punchy colours that stay just the right side of gaudy. With a typical brightness of 450 nits and 1200 nits at its peak, it’s plenty bright enough too with episodes of TV on Netflix or Prime Video looking punchy.
The use of AMOLED also enables little flourishes like a subtle edge notification effect when you receive messages, and the inclusion of always-on display options. None of this would be possible with an LCD.
I’m always cautious about praising a cheap phone for packing in a 120Hz refresh rate. Limitations elsewhere – such as less capable processors and inferior optimisation – tend to act as bottlenecks, inhibiting the super-smooth effect. The Redmi Note 10 Pro doesn’t escape these issues, and using it doesn’t compare to flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21. There are levels of 120Hz, just as not every 60Hz phone feels equally smooth.
Still, activating the elevated refresh rate does make general navigation a touch more pleasant. It’s a welcome dash of opulence, and a 240Hz touch sampling rate ensures that this display feels as responsive as it looks.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Camera – 108MP shots look good for the price

108MP sensor works great in good light
Moderate lighting can trouble it
Night Mode one of the best for the price

Google’s Pixel 3a and Pixel 4a aside, we rarely encounter affordable phones with genuinely decent cameras. This is where a significant portion of a flagship phone’s development budget will tend to go, after all. Just take a look at the best camera phones around for proof of that.

While it isn’t quite as impressive as it initially sounds, the Redmi Note 10 Pro’s 108-megapixel main camera is quite possibly the best you’ll find for less than £300. It utilises the 108MP 1/1.52″ Samsung ISOCELL HM2 sensor, which we’ve previously seen in the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 and the Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G.
This huge sensor utilises 9-to-1 pixel binning techniques to produce 12-megapixel snaps using chunky 2.1 μm ‘super pixels’. Essentially, the Redmi Note 10 Pro is capable of capturing more light and way more detail than other affordable phone cameras.
The results can be pretty darned great in good lighting, where all that extra sucked-in detail manifests in sharp, balanced snaps. Colours are extremely vibrant, occasionally verging on the slightly too in-your-face (especially reds), but generally pleasing to the eye. Dynamic range is pretty strong too.



It also has a Night Mode that’s better than most of its rivals, if still not at flagship levels (OIS is the big miss here). I took the Redmi Note 10 Pro out for a night time stroll along with the OnePlus Nord N10, the Realme 7 5G and the Poco X3 NFC, and took a bunch of identical Night Mode shots with them. The Redmi consistently pulled out the most detail and featured brighter, cleaner shots overall.

Where the Redmi Note 10 Pro camera seems to suffer most is those in-between lighting situations, where you’re past perfect daylight conditions yet Night Mode isn’t appropriate. I was quite surprised by the amount of noisy, grainy artefacts present in many of my daytime indoors shots, even whilst the colours were popping off and the thumbnails seemed to be on point. I was even more surprised to find that the camera struggled to lock on to my subjects in artificially lit dinner time conditions. You can see a bit of both in the teapot shot included in the image below.

At other times neither of these problems manifested, which leads me to think it’s an issue with Xiaomi’s algorithms, or maybe its typically-strong AI assistant. Hopefully the experience can be made more consistent with a future software update.
Xiaomi has obviously placed all its photographic eggs in one 108MP basket here. That’s perfectly understandable, but it does mean that elsewhere you have a mediocre 8MP ultrawide camera that shoots slightly murky landscape shots. As we’ve come to expect, the tone doesn’t quite match the main sensor, dynamic range isn’t great, and detail levels fall off towards the edges.
The ultra wide camera
There’s no telephoto camera provision here. Instead, Xiaomi uses the main sensor’s surfeit of pixels to crop in. On the plus side, this means that the colour tone and dynamic range are always on point in a way that they aren’t for those ultrawide snaps. On the negative side, the detail level degrades exponentially beyond 2X.
Replacing that telephoto sensor is a fairly pointless 5MP macro camera. In its defence, this sensor isn’t totally useless at capturing close-up shots, which is the case with most sub-2MP affordable macro cameras. I was able to take some pleasingly alien-looking close-ups of some succulents, but how many freaky plant close-ups do you take in your average week? 
The macro camera
Video capture extends to 4K 30fps, which is fairly typical for such a phone. Elsewhere, selfie duty is handled by a 16MP front camera, which yields pretty respectable results for a budget phone.
All in all, the Redmi Note 10 Pro’s camera setup is uncommonly good for its price. It’s not the night and day improvement over its closest rivals that its specs might lead you to expect, and it still falls well short of flagship levels but progress is progress, and this cheap camera phone is capable of great things under the right conditions.
Performance – Snappy Snapdragon 732G, busy MIUI

Snapdragon 732G is a capable budget chip
A choice of 6GB or 8GB RAM
MUI12 is ugly but customisable

The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10Pro runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 732G, which is the same capable lower-mid-range chip that powers the Poco X3 NFC.
I was pleased with this punchy chip’s performance in that late-2020 budget champ, and it continues to do the business here in early 2021. It’s capable of running a 120Hz display with only the occasional halt and stutter, and these instances will be barely perceptible to someone who doesn’t use a lot of high-end phones day to day.
You might experience the occasional pause when navigating through the Note 10 Pro’s menus, or when initiating an update of multiple apps in the Google Play store. Browsing through a media-rich web page isn’t as slick a process as with a more expensive phone, either. But again, that’s not something most customers will really notice.

Performance doesn’t quite live up to the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite with its Snapdragon 750G, however. It would have been nice to have that slightly faster chip to call on here, but the Redmi’s superior display and camera comfortably make up for a minor performance shortfall.
Besides, the Snapdragon 732G is a similarly capable gaming performer, with a GPU that far outstrips lesser chips attributed to the Snapdragon 665 and the Helio G95. You can expect PUBG Mobile to default to High Frame Rate and HD graphics – something that’s no doubt aided by a decent 6GB or 8GB of RAM.
I’d usually provide Geekbench 5 results at this point, but for whatever reason the benchmark test would consistently crash on my Redmi Note 10 Pro model. Rest assured that it feels every inch as capable as the Poco X3 NFC.
Storage options are decent, if not best in class. You have the option of 64GB or 128GB, with the added bonus of a microSD slot. 
The one glaring spec omission here is 5G. We’ve all grown accustomed to seeing cutting edge mobile connectivity present at this end of the market by now, to the point where I feel duty bound to cite this in the ‘Cons’ field of the review. But in truth, I really don’t think it’s a big deal beyond a missed box-ticking opportunity.
Does achieving 5G connection speeds feel magical? You’re damned right it does, but part of that feeling is down to the fact that achieving a full and sustained 5G connection is so vanishingly rare for most people, even within major cities.
By taking the brave decision to cut 5G from the package and place its resources elsewhere, Xiaomi has merely demonstrated that it’s got its priorities straight. If 5G is that important to you, there are plenty of 5G-ready phones available at a similar price – several of which are mentioned in this review. But know that you won’t get as good a display or as capable a camera with any of them.
Maybe I’m experiencing a kind of smartphone Stockholm syndrome having been held captive by using Xiaomi’s software so much over the past few months, but I think I’m warming to Xiaomi’s distinct approach to Android. This is MIUI 12 layered over Android 11, and it’s as colourful and customisable as it was when I used it on the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite and the Poco X3 NFC. 
You still get the option of gestures or virtual buttons. I also appreciate the option of a split notification pane, enabling you to pull down notifications by dragging down from the left and settings toggles by pulling down from the right.
You also have Xiaomi’s own custom apps and tools, many of which I stashed away in a makeshift junk folder early on in my time with the phone. Gallery, Music, Mi Video, Weather, Notes, and Mi Browser are functionally fine, but there are way better and more popular options out there. Some of them are even preinstalled right alongside them in the case of Google Photos, YouTube Music, and Chrome.
There’s also a smattering of third party apps preinstalled like Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, eBay and TikTok. I’m never in favour of such presumptuousness on the part of developers, but it’s a common enough practice by now to be greeted with a shrug rather than any great annoyance.
One thing that is most definitely worthy of a stern tut is Xiaomi’s ugly full-page ads, which rudely insert themselves every time you install a new app in the Google Play Store. I still find it worryingly easy to get lost within Xiaomi’s Settings menu, too – something that the company itself seems to acknowledge with the provision of redirecting help links at the bottom of each section.

Ultimately, Xiaomi’s software continues to be way behind that of OnePlus and Motorola (let alone Google’s and Apple’s software) in terms of tastefulness and layout, but it’s stable and inviting, quick to lend a hand – often to a fault – and eminently customisable.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Battery Life – Two day potential

5020mAh battery is ample
Two day potential for light users, comfortable all-day for everyone else
33w charger for speedy top-ups

The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro is a star when it comes to stamina. With a large 5020mAh battery and no power-hogging 5G to worry about, it’s a phone with genuine two-day potential should you be light or occasional user.
Of course, with a 120Hz display and a budget processor, it’s not without its power-hungry components. But even so, I never felt like I was going to come up short with this phone.
It wasn’t uncommon for me to go to bed after a particularly easy day of usage (just 2-3 hours of screen on time) with 50 to 60% left in the tank. More intensive use would bring it down below that magic two-day mark, but I was never sweating come the end of a busy day.
An hour of Amazon Prime Video streaming with the screen cranked up to full brightness sapped 8% of a charge, which is good for a budget phone. The Poco X3 NFC sapped 11 to 13% under the same conditions, while the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite drained 12 to 14%.
The Redmi Note 10 Pro charges nice and quickly for a budget phone too, with a bundled in 33W charger that’s supposedly capable of going 0 to 59% in half an hour. I never ran it down to absolute zero to test that claim, but I did observe that it was able to go from 17 to 30% in 15 minutes, and 50% to 90% in 30 minutes.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro Conclusion
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro is one of the best cheap phones you can buy, it is even better than some of the best mid-range phones we have reviewed. 
It’s not the prettiest sub-£300 handset on the market, and you’ll have to be prepared to make do without 5G connectivity, but there’s so much here for the money that it’s hard to resist.
You should buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro if…

You want the best screen for the price

You don’t usually see phones this cheap with displays like this. The large 6.67-inch 120Hz panel is excellent and the true star of the show.

You want a good camera but can’t stretch to the Pixel 4a

The 108MP sensor used here allows for strong snaps if the light is good. It’s not quite as good, or as reliable as the Pixel 4a, but it isn’t too far off. The Night Mode is excellent too.
You shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro if…

Classy design is key

Picking fault with a phone that offers value this good is tough, but the Note 10 Pro isn’t quite perfect. Some sacrifices have been made in terms of design and this is a bit plastic fantastic.

You like a clean Android experience

If you’ve read any of our other reviews for Xiaomi phones, then you’ll know the overly intrusive software is a constant niggle. It’s no better here.

You want 5G

The obvious missing feature here is 5G. For me, this isn’t a big deal yet. For you, that might make this a miss.

Verdict


































The Oppo Find X3 Pro is a great Android phone and if you’re not keen on the hefty size of the S21 Ultra then it does offer a tempting alternative. It takes excellent pictures and has one of the best screens on any phone you can buy.



Pros
Thin and light for a 6.7-inch phoneAdaptive 120Hz display is gorgeous and highly customisableOppo’s software has seen huge improvements

Cons
Battery life not as good as the Galaxy S21 UltraLoses the periscope zoom skills of the Find X2 ProVibration motor is terrible

Review Price: £10996.7-inch 1440p displayHDR10+ supportSnapdragon 888 with 5G4500mAh battery65w charging2x 50MP camera


The Oppo Find X3 Pro is the follow up to our favourite phone of 2020 and in many ways it’s much better than the X2 Pro.
The rapid rise in quality of Oppo’s phones over the recent year has been staggering, peaking with the Find X2 Pro deservedly bagging the Phone of the Year gong at the Trusted Reviews Awards 2020.
The Oppo Find X3 Pro is the brand’s next flagship and it’s everything I would expect from a phone that wants to rival the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the other best Android phones on the market. In some ways, I would even recommend it over Samsung’s behemoth, especially if you want a thinner, lighter device, but that’s not to say it’s perfect.
There’s no regular Oppo Find X3, with the other members of the family comprising the mid-range Oppo Find X3 Neo and affordable Find X3 Lite.
Oppo Find X3 Pro pricing and availability
The Oppo Find X3 Pro will be available in the UK from April 14 for £1099 in a single 12GB RAM/256GB storage combo, putting it right in the crosshairs of the Galaxy S21 Ultra (£1149) and iPhone 12 Pro Max (£1099). 
It will be available through O2, Carphone Warehouse and via Oppo itself in both the blue variant (that’s the one you’ll see in this review) and grey. You can also buy it through EE, Vodafone, Three, Virgin Mobile and Sky in the glossy grey hue only.
Elsewhere, it’ll be available for €1149 from mid-April in other European countries. It won’t be sold in the US.
Design and Screen – The Oppo Find X3 Pro is a gorgeous phone with a fantastic display

Considering the big 6.7-inch display, this is a great feeling phone to hold
The curved OLED display is stunning for gaming and media running at 1440p and 120Hz
Multiple finishes included blue (matte) and grey (glossy)

After spending the last few months with the iPhone 12 Pro Max and then the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra weighing down my pockets, it’s refreshing to hold the Find X3 Pro. 
This is a much lighter phone than its rivals and while it is still big (nothing with a 6.7-inch is ever going to be small) the use of curves help it feel very comfortable to hold.
I’ve got the blue version here for review which has a lovely matte finish on the back. It’s smooth to the touch and doesn’t pick up any fingerprints whatsoever. Pick the grey model though and you’ll get a glossy back. Personally, I much prefer the matte finish and would have liked to see it across the whole range, as glossy finishes tend to be fingerprint magnets.

At least there’s a nice colour-matched silicone case in the box to cover up that fingerprint-prone glossy finish. All the usual mod-cons are here too, including an IP68 rating for water and dust protection and a USB-C port on the bottom for fast charging. 
Both the front and back are covered in Gorilla Glass 5 (not the latest Victus version though) and there’s a dual SIM slot on the bottom. Like the Galaxy S21 and X2 Pro, there’s no expandable storage.
The back of the Find X3 Pro is where the real design shines. The camera module has been tightly integrated into the design to the point it looks like it’s trying to burst free of its case. There’s certainly a hint of the iPhone 12 Pro here, not least in the moody blue hue, but I think the Find X3 Pro stands as one of the best phones around when it comes to looks. It’s simple and free of excessive branding, something that bothered me with the Xiaomi Mi 11.
Flip the X3 Pro over and the screen impresses as much as the design. This is a beauty of a panel with some serious tech behind the curved glass. There’s a 1440p resolution panel with support for HDR10+, an adaptive refresh rate and in-display fingerprint authentication.
There’s an in-display fingerprint sensor here
Unlike a typical 120hz refresh rate, this phone can move between multiple rates like 24Hz, 30Hz and 60Hz. A 120Hz panel gives you smoother scrolling and more responsive gaming, but it’s not always utilised well, when watching a film for example, and can waste battery. An adaptive refresh rate curtails this risk, ensuring you’re only at 120Hz when you need to be.
You can tweak the screen
Android screens have taken a huge leap forward already this year and this is one of the best. Load up an episode of HDR content on Netflix – I’ve used my usual episode of Altered Carbon as a test – and you’ll see bright colours pop and blacks look perfectly deep and inky. If you’re watching SDR content then there’s some software trickery that’ll add a little more oomph to the saturation.
I’m a big fan of how customisable the display is too, giving you full reign over colours and gamuts. There’s a mode that offers a cinematic look and utilises the P3 gamut, while another aims to cover sRGB. Whether or not you know what these mean, the results will help you tweak the experience. 
I have been using this phone heavily in bright sunshine over the past few days and there’s enough brightness here to get by, though to my eyes the panel on the S21 Ultra can get even brighter.
Oppo Find X3 Pro Camera – A duo of 50MP sensors and a focus on 10-bit recording

You get two 50MP sensors – one wide, and the other ultra wide
The third camera offers hybrid zoom
There are plenty of AI-infused camera modes and a quirky microscope option

The  Oppo Find X3 Pro takes a different route than the Find X2 Pro and the current best camera phone – the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra – with its rear camera setup. It ditches the periscope zoom camera, instead focussing on ultra wide and wide performance.

If you want a phone that can reliably offer 10x, 30x and even 100x zoom then you might be disappointed. But holding the phone I think Oppo made the right call as ditching the periscope lens helps keep the weight down and ensures the camera bump is small.
Oppo has put a lot more focus into the ultra wide camera which uses the same Sony IMX 766 sensor as the main camera. Having essentially the same camera on both aside from focal lengths is rare and it makes the Find X3 Pro far better for ultra wide shots.
The zoom skills that are here are taken care of by a 13MP telephoto camera, which offers 3x optical and 5x hybrid zoom. Finally, there’s a 3MP Microlens which offers, Oppo said, up to 60x magnification.
It’s a very capable setup and I have been impressed with the pictures I have shot over the past week. The 12.5MP shots that come from the 50MP sensors are detailed and, when viewed on the Find X3 Pro’s display, are beautifully vibrant. The images shot from both the wide and ultra wide have similar traits and there’s very little distortion on the latter.
Ultra wide shots are fantastic
The quality continues in lower-light situations too. There is a multi-exposure night mode for when there’s virtually zero light, but I have found the sensors are more than capable of shooting in darker environments without much help. The picture of the puppy below was taken in near darkness, yet it’s bright and the detail isn’t over-sharpened or non-existent.
There’s load of detail in low light

There’s a whiff of Samsung with the colour tuning, as reds and greens pop with high levels of saturation. I have been shooting a lot on brighter days and both the wide and ultra wide cameras pack so much vibrancy into pictures. Transfer your snaps back over to a computer and they look a little flat, but that’s not uncommon. The screen here is designed to be the best place to view the images and that’s certainly the case.
Colours are bright and punchy
Snaps are packed with detail

There are a couple of customisation options available to you when you shoot, including using the full 50MP resolution for slightly more detail, but at the expense of any zoom skills, along with 10-bit colour support. The latter will cause some compatibility issues with older apps and screens, however when used correctly it does give you the ability to capture even more colours.
If you want more control then the Pro mode is one of the best out there with all sorts of options to tweak these impressive camera sensors. There’s a RAW+ mode, for instance, which combines the strength of RAW capture with some of the phone’s HDR skills.
You can get really close to subjects and still pull out decent detail using the macro mode – look at the shot of a PS5 DualSense controller for an example.

The use of the microscopic camera, or microlens as Oppo calls it, gives the phone another handy trick. You can get even closer into subjects with and it’s particularly clever to see intricate details inside an LCD (see below) or plant. It’s very gimmicky, but clever nevertheless even if it can be fiddly to get a good shot.
A 60x look inside a 4K LCD montor
Ink on paper, again at 60x magnification
Photo capture is only a part of the story, as like many of the best phones around now video capture is arguably just as important. The Find X3 Pro can capture 4K HDR footage at 10-bit colour and if you want flat footage for processing and colour correction then there’s LOG shooting too. You don’t get that with an iPhone.

The video here is punchy (when not in LOG, of course) and very pleasing. Stabilisation is great and I had no problems keeping up with a sprinting puppy without any obvious shakes.
Oppo Find X3 Pro Performance – Everything you’d expect from a 2021 Android flagship phone

The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 888 cup and features loads of RAM and storage
Oppo’s software has been improved a lot over the past year
120Hz adaptive display makes everything feel quick

I have already reviewed a few Snapdragon 888 (or very similar) phones this year and the Oppo Find X3 Pro follows the same path. This is supremely fast chip that’s easily capable of handling any app or game at any setting. The hefty 12GB RAM and controlled management of the system means apps stay open for a long time letting you easily hop back to them.
If you’re a gamer, the 888 Platform has a beefed-up GPU when compared to 865 and all titles I tried were smooth and responsive. Bouts of PUBG and CoD Mobile didn’t cause the device to heat up and there are numerous software tweaks that make gaming more immersive.
Great performance isn’t just for gaming though. The effects of the flagship chip are felt everywhere, from the support for 5G to some improved camera processing. I never ran into any lag during my week with the phone, which is to be expected from a device that’ll set you back a grand.
The benchmark scores the Find X3 Pro chalked up matched my real-world use and its predictably among the top scorers both for its CPU and GPU.
One of the things I didn’t like much about the Find X2 Pro was Oppo’s interpretation of Android. The latest version of ColorOS you’ll find here fixes many of my issues, with a far more Google-influenced look. Swiping through the UI is quick and, unlike on the Xiaomi Mi 11, I didn’t suffer any app crashes or notice a plethora of bugs.

There has been one thing that has stood out as being oddly poor during my time with the Find X3 Pro: the vibration motor. Even when it’s cranked up to the max, the tinny vibration is barely strong enough to register a buzz on my desk. I have missed countless messages and calls as I just can’t tell when the phone is going off. For the first time in countless years I have had to turn my phone off silent.
It’s a better story with audio and call quality. The speakers are on par with other Android phones that pack a full-screen look and you get a pair of USB-C earbuds in the box.
Battery Life – Does amazing endurance matter when charging is this quick?

65w charging is very quick
Wireless charging added after missing the X2 Pro
4500mAh battery inside

One thought has crossed my mind consistently since I started using the Find X3 Pro: does epic battery life really matter when you can go from 0-100% in less than 40 minutes?
Of course, you still need to be able to get through the day comfortably – something the Find X3 Pro is capable of. Throughout my week I have been getting roughly between five to six hours of screen-on time per full charge, which is good but not the best. Working from home has changed my habits slightly, but I am still confident this would get most people through the day without much hassle.
You can, of course, get more juice if you dial back the screen a bit. Stick to FHD+ resolution is one way, or forcing the refresh rate to stay at 60Hz. 
An hour of Netflix HDR streaming took off 7%, which is more than the same test on the S21 Ultra.
I have never felt worried about the battery life though, as I knew a full charge could happen so quickly. Instead of charging overnight, I now just plug it in while I am having a shower and making coffee in the morning and we’re at 100% by the time I am ready to sit down at my desk.
A full charge in about 38-40 minutes is far quicker than anything offered by Samsung or Apple and if there’s fast wireless charging if you can get hold of a capable pad. The Find X2 Pro omitted wireless charging completely, so it’s nice to have it here.
The included charger
To get these speeds you do need to use the bulky included charger, so plugging it into your MacBook Pro charger won’t give you those fast speeds.
Oppo Find X3 Pro Conclusion
With so much choice at all price-ranges now, phones that cost above a grand have to be pretty much exceptional to warrant a true recommendation. There’s no margin of error anymore, especially when something like the Xiaomi Mi 11 offers many of the same features for a lot less.
The Oppo Find X3 Pro is a great Android phone and if you’re not keen on the hefty size of the S21 Ultra then it does offer an alternative. It doesn’t feel quite as innovative as the Find X2 Pro though, with things like the leather back and periscope zoom ditched for a more traditional outcome.
You should buy the Oppo Find X3 Pro if…

You want to take a lot of ultra wide shots: By using the same high-end sensor for both the wide and ultra wide cameras, Oppo has ensured that whichever focal length you shoot with you’ll get a quality shot. The ultra wide camera with 110-degree field of view is a secondary sensor, but right at the forefront of Oppo’s thinking.
You don’t want to wait around for the phone to charge: Oppo provides a hefty 65w charger in the box and it can take the Find X3 Pro from 0-100% in around 38-40 minutes in my tests. That’s impressive stuff.
You want a gorgeous display and a sleek design: I love the look of the Find X3 Pro, especially in the version with the smooth blue finish. It’s lighter than the Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro Max too. The sleek design melds with the 120Hz HDR display which is vibrant and bright.

You shouldn’t buy the Oppo Find X3 Pro if…

You want multi-day battery life: There’s a 4500mAh battery inside the Find X3 Pro which does offer good endurance. You can stretch the battery out further if you disable some of the higher-end skills (1440p resolution, adaptive refresh) but in a pure battery battle, the S21 Ultra lasts longer.
You want a phone with a great zoom camera: Oppo has sacrificed the periscope zoom skills of the Find X2 Pro for the followup, instead focussing on hybrid zoom and ultra wide performance. If you do want a phone capable of getting 10x or even 30x closer to the action then this isn’t for you.

Verdict


































The ROG Phone 5 is an excellent smartphone, combining a premium screen, killer specs, a decent camera, long-lasting battery life and fantastic stereo speakers. Its styling won’t be for everyone – and it’s very similar to the ROG Phone 3, which enjoyed a more limited release – but if you can hack its size and styling, and want a fantastic portable media player and gaming device, you’ll be hard-pushed to find more for less.



Pros
Long-lasting, fast-charging battery144Hz AMOLED screenFantastic stereo speakers

Cons
No telephoto cameraNo wireless chargingFantastic stereo speakers

Skipping the number four and going straight to five, Asus is dropping not one, but three versions of its latest gaming handset, the ROG Phone Phone 5. Available in vanilla, a Pro and Ultimate versions, the series is the world’s first to deliver up to 18GB of RAM, and more customisable on-body buttons than any other handset on the market.
The Asus ROG Phone 5 builds on a legacy of smartphones tuned to tickle gamers, matched with custom accessories, RGB lighting and speakers that will flood sound your way from a front-firing direction. Hits and misses have paved the way for a gaming phone in 2021, from the Razer Phone and Razer Phone 2, to the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel and, of course, past ROG Phones. But have generations of cautionary tales taught the Taiwanese tech giant enough to make the perfect gaming phone?

Asus says, yes – and at a first glance of the ROG Phone 5’s specs I’m inclined to agree. This device comes loaded with gamer delights, from a 144Hz custom Samsung AMOLED screen, Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 power, a 6000mAh battery, stereo audio with a built-in high-grade DAC (plus a headphone port), a sweet suite of accessories, and software tuned to turbo-charge control over your gaming.
But do its impressive specs translate into a positive real world experience? After thoroughly using the device I can confirm, for the most part, yes they do. Here’s why.
ROG Phone 5 combines gaming grunt with a dash of dot matrix

One of the better-looking gaming phones
Heavier than most smartphones at 238g
RGB lighting in dot matrix pattern on the back

Asus’s ROG Phones have always looked like gaming phones. Past iterations wouldn’t look out of place in the Fortress of Solitude, or as a new Decepticon in the next Transformer’s movie (please God, no). However, taking it out of the box I found the ROG Phone 5 is much less angry-looking than older Asus models.
Unlike the ROG Phone 2 and Lenovo Legion Phone Duel, for example, the ROG Phone 5 sports a single textured back panel – high-gloss curved glass with uncharacteristically subtle flourishes for the Asus ROG brand. Don’t get us wrong, the ROG Phone 5 still looks disgruntled, but stops before it gets enraged.

On the glass rear, you’ll spot an asymmetric camera bump that’s home to the triple-camera setup, there’s the dot matrix RGB ROG insignia, some red and white flourishes and a bit of typography. The front of the phone is screen and bezel, bookended with stereo speakers, while the sides, top and bottom play host to no less than two USB-C ports, one headphone jack, a pogo pin connector and volume and power buttons.
The phone weighs 238g, which is 10g heavier than the iPhone 12 Pro Max, making it a substantial mix of glass and metal. That means it does feel a lot heavier than traditional phones. It’s thick at 10.29mm, and will prove too hefty for most. On the plus side, though, this weight leads to a phone that feels well put together and more premium than its main rival from Lenovo. As is the case with most gaming phones, there’s no IP68 water- or dust-resistance – but that might be a small price to pay for all those lights around the back.

Also of note, the ROG Phone 5 has two touch-sensitive triggers that support tap and slide interaction on the top-left and right sides of the phone (when held in landscape), and a second USB-C-port to the left for landscape charging. In fact, Asus says the phone was built to be enjoyed in landscape orientation, and in this position, the back of the phone sports two additional touch inputs, while all versions of the device now support shake, tilt and turn command input.
The ROG Phone 5 screen combines a 144Hz refresh rate with AMOLED splendour

The custom Samsung AMOLED panel is one of the best for gaming
It has an ample sized 6.78-inch display with a 2448 x 1080 resolution (Wide Full HD)

The ROG Phone 5’s display is 6.78 inches big, which is larger than its predecessor, and most smartphones on the market. With a 20.4:9 aspect ratio screen, it’s tall and well-suited for widescreen gaming and watching films; but small hands will have trouble navigating it based on my experience using it.
The ROG Phone 5’s screen quality is where it needs to be, thanks to a custom Samsung AMOLED panel that delivers a Galaxy S21 Ultra-beating 144Hz refresh rate, lightning-fast 300Hz touch sampling, up to 800-nits of brightness and 111% DCI-P3 coverage.
All those stats are impressive, but the specs of the ROG Phone 5 screen aren’t world-beating in every respect. With wide Full HD resolution, I wouldn’t have minded a QHD+ panel on a screen of this size, and 800-nit peak brightness is good, but fails to beat the best out there. To non techies this means it is wonderfully bright and immersive, but not best in class at the moment.

Quibbles aside, one thing Asus gets very right is responsiveness. The ROG Phone 5 is the fastest-feeling screen I’ve tested, with nuanced haptic feedback and a lightning-fast refresh rate coming together fantastically. This makes playing games a blast with each shot and explosion offering much more immersive vibration feedback than you’ll find on most regular phones.
Saturation is strong, with movies and media looking a total treat set against inky, deep blacks and decent levels of detail, not to mention HDR10+ dynamic range for an excellent balance of contrast and tonal nuance.
A gaming beast – you’ll want the Asus ROG Phone 5 on your team

The use of a Snapdragon and up to 18GB of RAM make it a powerhouse when it comes to performance
Android 11 support means its one of the most up to date gaming phones available, when it comes to software
It has lots of optional accessories

With Qualcomm’s Android chipset a la mode fitted inside the ROG Phone 5, combined with Asus’s own cooling system, the handset games fast, cool and smooth – even when the performance is cranked up to the max.
You’ll find the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 inside such corkers as the global edition of the Galaxy S21 Plus and Xiaomi’s Mi 11, and it powers the ROG Phone 5 with all the gusto I’d expect from it, benchmarking with a Geekbench 5 single-core score of 1100 and a multi-core score of 3540 (16GB/256GB configuration). Where the ROG Phone comes into its own for gaming isn’t in its specs alone, though; it’s the whole setup.

Starting with software, the ROG Phone experience is much more considered than anything else it competes with. From firing up the phone and engaging an anime AR experience, to the Armoury Crate gaming customisations that make every other gaming interface pale by contrast by adding super-intuitive tools to create macros, map your gamepad buttons to games of your choice and more. During testing I found this is a dream setup for gamers such as myself. There’s also the option to totally strip back the gaming features and enjoy a more stock Android UI.
With a view to saving battery life, Asus sets the ROG Phone 5 to standard mode by default. You can switch to X-Mode+ performance mode with the squeeze of the sides of the phone. Adding to the gamer-focussed combination of hardware and software, the theme and wallpaper switches from cool blue to electric red with the switch into X-Mode+, and it doesn’t get old.

Despite identical internals, the ROG Phone 5 runs games such as Genshin Impact and Injustice 2 Gods Among Us more smoothly than the Xiaomi Mi 11, with more consistent frame rates at max settings. It also runs games cooler, and when combined with that AeroActive Cooler fan accessory, you even get two more hardware keys in addition to better heat management.
If two extra hardware keys still leaves you wanting, then I tested the phone with a Kunai 3 gamepad for the ROG Phone 5, to create a Wii-like handheld controller experience. It worked well, even when mapped to touch-controlled games such as Genshin Impact. If you already have a console, an alternative route would be to pick up a ROG Clip, so you can hook up your gaming phone to the PS4, Stadia and an Xbox controller.
Great for a gaming phone, but the ROG Phone 5 can’t beat the best flagships

64-megapixel main camera misses out on OIS, which can make blurs creep in
The 13-megapixel ultrawide and 5-megapixel fixed-focus macro camera aren’t industry leading

The ROG Phone 5 has a disappointing camera setup if you’re familiar with the ROG Phone 3, in that it’s exactly the same. This means it’s spearheaded by a 64-megapixel IMX686 sensor with no image stabilisation. There’s a 13-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a fixed-focus macro camera backing it up. Rehashing the same camera is something both Samsung and Google have done with some success – so if you’re put off, don’t be just yet.

Shooting 16-megapixel snaps by default, the ROG Phone 5 combines four pixels into one to create a sharper shot with better noise handling and dynamic range than a full-resolution photo. What Asus also gets very right is its software. It loads up the ROG Phone with the modes needed to get a good snap, from a smart automatic option that fires up Night mode by itself, to advanced Pro photo and video modes.
In turn, even though the hardware isn’t new, the ROG Phone 5 still captures decent photos. In bright environments, it can happily cope with a little backlighting as a result of auto HDR. When the lights drop, an automatic Night mode kicks in – which, when combined with a steady hand, results in printable photos.
The ultrawide camera is weaker than the primary camera and misses out on nice-to-haves such as autofocus, which is a shame if you want to capture landscape shots. That said, it’s supported by both Night mode and Pro mode, so even if it isn’t fed great light, it can still deliver the goods if you know your way around a manual camera.

As for the macro camera, on seeing the 5-megapixel count, I was hoping for the module on the Xiaomi Mi 11 with autofocus, which has the ability to grab some genuinely special shots. Sadly, it’s the same macro cam as found on last year’s ROG Phone. While it’s okay, it isn’t great, with fussy fixed focus, mediocre noise-handling and below-par results for a flagship smartphone in 2021.
Despite these gripes, I can’t help but think about the ROG Phone 5’s gaming phone competition: the Black Shark 3, Legion Phone Duel and Nubia Red Magic 3. The ROG Phone 5 is better than all three in every respect as a camera phone – and as a phone in general.
Adding to the appeal, video captured on the ROG Phone 5 looks decent, with electronic image stabilisation making up for a lack of OIS. With resolutions climbing up to 8K (30fps) and noise-handling respectable, despite mediocre low-light performance, the ROG Phone 5’s video capture is at least competitive.

Day-long gaming? Not quite, but not far off with the ROG Phone 5.

It has a huge 6000mAh battery, but still doesn’t quite last a full day’s use
Charges at 65W (charger included) which makes it quick to top up the battery
There’s no wireless charging support

With 6000mAh of battery power, the ROG Phone 5 has one of the biggest power cells around, which is handy because all that gaming makes for thirsty work. It’s little wonder the phone battery depletes significantly faster when in X-Mode+. However, unless you’re full-on smashing the battery with high-pace blasting and blitzing, you shouldn’t have any trouble lasting a full day.
A 65W charger and a dual-cell battery ensure the ROG Phone 5 powers up fast. Just 10 minutes plugged in gets you 25% power, plus 20 minutes half-fills the tank, and you can get a full charge in just 58 minutes.

I can’t overstate how good the ROG Phone is for watching content, and you’ll be able to stream for hours, with 30 minutes of Netflix streaming on full brightness depleting the battery by just 7%. Gaming is more demanding, with 30 minutes of Genshin Impact and Injustice 2 zapping it by 15-20%. That said, it kept its cool better than the competition, including the Galaxy S21 Plus, Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Xiaomi Mi 11.
Asus ROG Phone 5 conclusion
The Asus ROG Phone 5 is one of the best gaming phones ever made. It offers a top notch, wonderfully fast and immersive screen, super fast performance and a wealth of custom gaming features you won’t find elsewhere. But its outlandish design and below average, for a flagship, camera will put off non-gamers looking for a top end flagship.
You should buy the Asus ROG Phone 5 if:

You love watching or listening to anything on your smartphone: The ROG Phone 5 screen and speakers make it one of the best multimedia phones around, and if you can handle its gaming look and feel, then you’ll be glued to it.
You want to game on your phone regularly: As for gaming, the ROG Phone 5 is the best Android gaming phone you can buy thanks to its stability, on-body controls and optional accessories.


You shouldn’t buy the Asus ROG Phone 5 if:

You’re a fan of subtle design and small phones, or need the best camera phone you can buy: The ROG Phone 5 is a gaming phone, brimming with features that look loud and proud with RGB lights and gaming themes preinstalled. While it may be one of the more subtle-looking gaming handsets on the market, it’s anything but demure when set against more traditional mobiles. If you’re a phone user first in need of a compact device, or a telephoto camera and optical image stabilisation, then you’ll want to opt for a non-gaming phone.

Verdict































The OnePlus Nord N10 5G is a very capable phone for the price but, aside from 5G connectivity, there’s little on offer to differentiate it in this increasingly competitive segment of the market. 



Pros
Great value for moneySolid gaming performanceAffordable entry point to 5G

Cons
Camera isn’t the best you’ll find at this priceNo IP rating

Key Specifications
Review Price: £2495G ready6GB RAMQualcomm Snapdragon 690Android 10128GB memory (with expandable storage)4300mAh batteryFour-rear cameras


The OnePlus N10 5G is the latest low-to-mid-range smartphone aiming to wrestle control of the affordable market from Motorola’s iconic Moto G line.
It comes packed with all the hardware you’d expect from a handset with such lofty goals, with highlights including 5G connectivity and a super-fast 90Hz refresh rate screen – two features that even a year ago you’d only see on more expensive handsets.
Following more than a month with the Nord, I can confirm it is indeed a very impressive handset – and one of the best cheap phones with 5G you can get right now. The downside is that it fails to fully deliver in a couple of key areas, making it only a great, not perfect, phone.
Design


The Nord N10 5G has a plastic back that feels a lot like the Moto G’s

There’s no IP rating, so you’ll want to avoid getting it wet

It does come with a fingerprint scanner on its back


The Nord N10 5G sports a very similar design to most of the phones I test at this price. As such, it has a super-shiny plastic – not glass – back and a Gorilla Glass front with a hole-punch camera housing. If this sounds familiar, it should; design-wise, it’s pretty much identical to the Moto G Pro and Moto G 5G Plus that passed through Trusted Labs last year.
Taking the phone out of the box, the midnight blue adds a welcome touch of class and the phone does feel reasonably well built. But the plastic rear is a fingerprint magnet and suffers a couple of millimetres of flex when pressed. So if you want to keep the phone in a clean state, I’d advise picking up a case.
The lack of an IP68 rating is pretty standard at this price, and no surprise given that OnePlus doesn’t bother getting water-resistance certification for its flagships, in a bid to cut costs.
The Nord N10 5G does come with the trimmings you’d expect, though. On its rear you’ll find a centrally placed fingerprint scanner, positioned to sit where your index finger naturally falls. During testing, it proved suitably accurate. The only time I experienced repeated failures to recognise my digit was when using the phone in the rain.
The handset’s slightly curved glass screen cover also makes it suitably comfortable to hold and use one-handed, although the smooth plastic can become fairly slippery when wet.

I’m also a big fan of the fact OnePlus has retained the increasingly rare 3.5mm and microSD inputs as part of the design. The 3.5mm jack will allow you to use cabled headphones and peripherals with the phone, while the inclusion of the microSD will mean you can upgrade the N10’s 128GB of internal storage to 512GB.
My only major issue is that, unlike most phones from OnePlus, the design of the Nord N10 5G is very similar to rival handsets, which is a shame given the company’s history.
Although we tend to go on about Moto Gs being the top dogs in the affordable phone market, OnePlus actually has a strong track record innovating in this space. Back in 2016, it released one of the most interesting budget phones I’ve ever tested, in the shape of the OnePlus X. The £200 handset was one of the best-looking on the market, and a cut above the competition thanks to its use of custom Onyx, or Ceramic materials.
Given how good the X was from a design perspective, it feels odd that OnePlus hasn’t opted to go down the same track with the Nord N10 5G.
Screen


The OnePlus Nord’s 6.49 inch, 1080 x 2400 resolution IPS screen looks great and has some nifty customisation options


The 90Hz refresh rate makes it a solid choice for gamers


Thankfully, my experience with the OnePlus Nord N10 5G’s display was far more positive; during testing it proved to be one of the best you’ll find at the price.
The 6.49-inch IPS panel doesn’t offer the punchy blacks of more expensive AMOLED screens, but it avoids a pitfall I experience on most competing affordable phones. Specifically, it doesn’t attempt to mask its LCD roots by overcooking the colours. This is a key tactic adopted by a lot of phone companies to make cheap screens look more vibrant. While some people like the added punch, it does in fact make the screen terrible for movie-watching, photo editing and pretty much any task where accuracy is key.
Which is the reason I appreciated OnePlus’s more relaxed approach with the Nord N10 5G. Out of the box colours look suitably accurate, if a little cool. This, plus the 1080 x 2400 resolution means that text and icons consistently looked sharp. For those who want the added punch, there’s also a slider control that ups the screen level to warm in the phone’s settings.
This, plus reasonably good max brightness levels meant that, despite the lack of HDR certification, the Nord N10 Plus screen is large and sufficiently well-calibrated on which to comfortably watch movies and TV shows. The only time it struggles is when you watch particularly murky scenes, such as that infamous battle in Game of Thrones. In these moments you’ll struggle to spot key details, but this is an issue on pretty much every affordable phone I test with an LCD panel.
I’m also a big fan of the phone’s high refresh rate. The Nord N10 5G is one of a growing sea of affordable-to-mid-range handsets to bring high refresh panels down in price. Specifically, on the Nord N10 5G it means you can set the screen to run at either 60Hz or 90Hz. Hertz is a metric used to measure how many images per second a screen displays.

Traditionally, phones are locked to run at 60Hz. A higher refresh rate is a positive, since it makes the screen feel smoother to use in general. It can also offer a competitive advantage in reaction-based tasks such as online gaming, by reducing the delay between each new animation being shown. The only negative is that higher refresh rates put an added drain on the battery.
Testing the N10 5G, I found the tech worked well, making the handset one of the best at this price for PUBG and CoD Mobile. In general, games felt smoother to run – and for the past week I’ve been able to use the Nord N10 5G with the Razer Kishi to stream games in bed over the cloud using GeForce Now without hassle.
Performance


The Nord N10 5G is one of the best-value 5G phones on the market


It offers superior performance to many competing affordable phones


The main selling point for the Nord N10 5G is its next-generation connectivity. The phone is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 690 5G-ready chipset and 6GB of RAM. Currently, there aren’t many other such handsets on the market, with most other mid-rangers such as the Moto G 5G Plus using the Snapdragon 765G and costing a little more as a result.
In real-world use, the 690 performed admirably despite being unable to match the 7-series chip’s performance. Games universally ran fine, although I did find myself having to lower PUBGs settings to fully take advantage of the 90Hz refresh rate. Otherwise, apps opened instantly and I didn’t experience any slowdown or unduly long load times streaming video on Netflix and Disney Plus.
The only time I noticed the phone struggling was during more intensive tasks. Editing pictures in Photoshop Express, the Nord N10 would chug along, and the camera app felt a little sluggish, especially when trying to capture multiple images in rapid succession. In addition, media-heavy websites would take a fraction of second longer to load than they did on competing phones with the 765 chipset, such as the Moto G 5G Plus and Pixel 4a 5G.
The OnePlus Nord N10’s synthetic benchmark scores mirrored my real-world experience. You can see how it performed in the table below. Benchmarks are synthetic tests designed to let you gauge various details of a phone’s performance using simulated processes.

Camera


The Nord N10 has a quad-sensor rear camera and can capture decent photos in good light

Its macro and monochrome cameras are pretty useless

Low-light performance isn’t anything to write home about


Aside from the notable exception of Google’s Pixel 4a and 4a 5G, I’m yet to review a mid-range or budget phone recently with a camera I’d describe as anything but usable. This remains the case having reviewed the OnePlus Nord N10, which won’t be making its way onto our best camera phone list.
The phone’s rear camera sounds impressive enough, with OnePlus having loaded it with a quad-sensor arrangement combining 64-megapixel (main), 8-megapixel (ultrawide), 2-megapixel (macro) and 2-megapixel (monochrome) parts.
To a layperson, the above specification may sound almost flagship-level: with that many sensors it has to be good, right? But being blunt, as is the case with megapixels, a higher number of sensors isn’t indicative of solid photo quality. It’s about the quality of the parts, their setup and the processing that takes place in the back-end.

Opening up the app, I found the OnePlus N10 5G’s camera distinctly average, even at this price. Like the Moto G Pro I tested last year, the less said about the extra sensors the better. The ultrawide is the only one of the three that can consistently capture usable photos for social media – and even then, look closely at captured shots and you’ll notice they uniformly look soft or display issues with focus. The monochrome only works when shooting in black and white; but it’s very slow, with a noticeable delay between pressing the capture button and an image being taken. The macro also suffers focusing issues, making it tough to use, especially when trying to capture fast-moving subjects such as my cats.
The main 64-megapixel sensor works better, and is capable of taking usable photos in regular light. However, the lack of any stabilisation means you’ll need a steady hand while shooting. The 64-megapixel sensor, which captures 16-megapixel images, manages to retain decent levels of detail and reasonably realistic-looking colours  again, if you hold it steady. Low-light performance also isn’t anything to write home about. In dim conditions, focusing issues creep in and captured images usually suffer from noise.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the OnePlus Nord N10 5G below.
     
Battery


The Nord N10 is powered by a 4300mAh battery and supports 30T Warp Charge


Battery life is solid, but no better than the competition


The Nord N10 5G doesn’t feature anything close to the behemoth 6000mAh battery seen in Motorola’s Moto G9 Power. Instead, it’s powered by a 4300mAh cell.
During testing, I found it offered solid battery life and would generally last between one to two day’s use from a single charge and using the phone as my primary work and personal handset. This entailed listening to music during my morning workout, regularly checking incoming messages and alerts, watching a few YouTube videos throughout the day, and an hour on GeForce Now ahead of bed.
You can add another day’s use if you downgrade the display to run at 60Hz – although, personally, I preferred the added smoothness of the 90Hz mode.
More intensive tasks do put a bigger drain on the battery, however. Streaming video with the screen brightness set to 150 nits, over Wi-Fi the phone lasted an average of 9-10% of its charge per hour. This is on a par with the figure I detected running the same test on the Moto G Pro late last year.
It’s a similar story with gaming. Playing demanding titles such as PUBG, the Nord N10 5G typically discharged between 18-20% of its battery per hour. This is a little higher than average and likely due to the 90Hz display. Lowering the refresh rate to 60Hz, the discharge figure went down to 12-15%.

You should buy it if:

You’re an avid mobile gamer on a budgetThe OnePlus N10 5G is a great option if you’re a regular mobile gamer looking for a solid phone that won’t break the bank. The 90Hz display is excellent and wonderfully reactive, and 5G connectivity makes it an ideal option for early adopters using services such as Stadia and GeForce Now.
You want 5G but can’t afford a flagshipThe OnePlus Nord N10 5G is one of the best affordable 5G phones you can get right now for less than £300/$300.

You shouldn’t buy it if:

You want a good cameraThe OnePlus N10 5G isn’t the best camera phone you can get at this price. Despite having a quad-sensor, the camera here struggles to perform in low light, and every sensor other than the main 64-megapixel snapper suffers from focusing and general quality issues.






A note from the Editor
The OnePlus Nord N10 may not be the most exciting phone I reviewed this year, but it’s one of the best value on the market. During testing I was amazed quite how many top end features OnePlus had managed to pack into its tiny chassis. This has made it my go to recommendation for any buyer that doesn’t want to spend lots of money on a phone, but still wants top end features like 5G connectivity and a gaming ready 90Hz screen.

Verdict





























 



Chunky, chinny, and notch-heavy, even with its clunky design, the Moto G30 is still a cracking low-cost smartphone for a certain type of user. Sitting alongside the Moto G9 Power and offering a slightly smaller, significantly more iridescent alternative with virtually identical innards — the fact it costs less and offers more is its saving grace. 



Pros

Long-lasting 5000mAh battery
90Hz screen at a low price
Primary camera can deliver great shots



Cons

Weak secondary cameras
Chunky design
Adequate performance






Key Specifications

Review Price: £160
Rear cameras: 64MP, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro, 2MP depth
5000mAh battery
6.5 inch LCD
Snapdragon 662
RAM/Storage: 4GB RAM, 128GB
200g



At £160/€180/$TBC, there’s plenty of competition for Motorola’s latest plastic fantastic budget phone, the Moto G30, but hardly any of it packs 128GB storage or a 90Hz screen. 
While the Moto G30’s design may be Marmite at first sight, it is certainly one of the best cheap phone options thanks to a selection of strong specs and a low price. 
The G30’s main competition comes in the form of the pricier Realme 7, a faster charging option only available online in the UK, and Motorola’s own G9 Power. While the G9 Power underwhelmed us with its performance does the Moto G30 strike the right balance?
Somewhere between an oil slick and a unicorn, the G30’s design shimmers confusingly


Plastic back panel sports a pink/green shimmer finish


Ships with a case in the box




Notch and big chin make it feel less than flagship


Motorola’s budget phones have never been design leaders, and the G30’s no exception, but it definitely feels like a standout looking device. Its plastic back is fantastically fingerprint repellant, thanks to its matte sheen, but it’s also confusingly Marmite in its finish. 
Iridescent, our Dark Pearl version has an oil-slick-a-like shimmer and depending on how you’re holding it, the Moto G30’s back looks either a slightly dirty pink, or a slightly dirty green, with sparkles thrown in for good measure. It’s also available in Pastel Sky for a more traditional shimmer pink look.

The Moto G30’s back wraps around the sides of the phone, which play host to a USB-C port and speaker at the base, a headphone jack at the top and power, volume and Google assistant buttons to the right. 
The phone weighs 197g, so not quite iPhone 12 Pro Max levels of weighty, but still, substantial given there’s no glass or metal around the back weighing it down. 
It’s relatively thick too, but on the plus, feels solid. With an 82.2% screen-to-bezel ratio, the Moto G30 doesn’t look bad, but its big chin and notable water droplet notch feel dated when set aside punch-hole camera competition like the cheaper Oppo A52.
While the Moto G30 can’t boast IP68 water or dust resistance, it is IP52 water repellent, and with a microSD card or second SIM slot within, and a fingerprint scanner around the back, there are some highlights dotted around its robust body. 
The Moto G30 screen combines a 90Hz refresh rate and predictable performance


IPS LCD screen technology



6.5 inches is big, but not Moto G9 Power big


720 x 1600 resolution (Wide HD)
292 PPI pixel density

The Moto G30 has a perfectly adequate screen with one flourish of excellence: its 90Hz refresh rate. At its £160/€180/$TBC price, we aren’t expecting OLED technology, so the IPS LCD panel stacks up well against the competition.
Punchiness is at a premium when it comes to low-cost displays, as are inky blacks, so you’ll instantly know you’re using a sub-£200 smartphone when you fire up the Moto G30, but once you get past your OLED FOMO and lean into the IPS experience, everything from Netflix to websites look as good as they need to.
Brightness levels are adequate, but won’t blow your mind, especially in sunnier scenarios. Automatic brightness is supported and a quick dive into the settings reveals a host of colour options, ranging from natural to boosted and saturated.

With a tall 20:9 aspect ratio, the G30’s display is well-suited to widescreen content and split-screen multitasking, but its height combined with the phone’s heft will leave your thumb stretching unless you have giant hands. In turn, small phone fans should look elsewhere.
A 90Hz refresh rate does make a difference, and the Moto G30 feels faster than the G9 Power which sports a 60Hz panel, despite the fact they feature the same innards. What’s more, the G30’s responsive to the touch, and a tad sharper than Moto’s pricier battery champ too. 
Performance – For the price, the Moto G30 is as powerful as it needs to be


Snapdragon 662 power



4GB RAM


720 x 1600 resolution (Wide HD)

292 PPI pixel density


The Moto G30 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 chipset, and while it isn’t a headline grabber, for the price, it delivers a smooth experience, especially given that 90Hz display and the illusion of speed it delivers.
Just like the Moto G9 Power, the G30 achieves a Geekbench 5 score of 305 single-core and 1260 multi-core. 
The G30 packs 4GB of RAM. That’s just about the minimum spec for running Android well these days, and all apps I ran operated well. There’s a bit of waiting for photo processing and occasional UI swiping as a but this never turned into force closes or failures to launch.
Gamers take note, the Moto G30 will probably run your favourite games, but not at high graphics settings. Injustice 2 gave us a throwback to PS1 levels of artefacting, and PUBG ran at Balanced/Medium graphics settings.

If you can handle Xiaomi’s MIUI interface, the Poco X3 NFC is amongst the best Android phones you can buy in the price region, with its 120Hz display and mightier specs, though it is a fair bit more expensive if it isn’t on offer.
The G30 does serve up 128GB of internal storage, which should be ample for most, and you can supplement it with a microSD card too.
Camera – Sports a decent wide-angle camera and that’s about it


Primary camera impresses on the whole



Ultrawide and macro camera deliver mediocre results

Video is well stabilised but crumbles in low light


Motorola’s crammed four cameras around the back of the G30 but you’ll only really get decent shots from one of them.
Spearheaded by a 64MP main camera with an f/1.7 lens and a 26mm wide-angle, for the price, it’s hard not to coo at big numbers like that. Second in command is an 8MP ultrawide camera with an 8MP resolution, an f/2.2 lens and a 118-degree field of view. Finally, there are two forgettable 2MP cameras, a depth sensor and a macro camera. 
Shooting 16MP snaps by default, the G30 combines four pixels into one to create a sharper shot with better noise handling and dynamic range than a full-resolution photo. The results are good for the most part, especially if you don’t mind waiting a second to see your snaps.
Photos taken in well-lit scenes pack stacks of detail, dynamic range is impressive with auto HDR firing up all by itself, and it even handles notoriously tough subjects like black cats respectably.
Sample picture with HDR

Once the lights drop, so too does clarity, with night mode resulting in softer shots, and blurry ones when hand shake or a moving subject are introduced to the mix. 
Motorola’s improved its processing and photo capture algorithms, but the camera still has its weaknesses. 


The ultrawide camera is another relative weak point, with no autofocus and middling detail. It’s very nice to have in bright scenes, but reminds us of a phone from 2012 when the lights drop. Add to that the fact it’s disabled in night mode, and it fast becomes clear, the ultrawide is a fairweather camera.
As for the macro camera, unless you clumsily fire up the flashlight, its photos will inevitably disappoint. Once you do, if you can stomach the glare an LED light spreads across a scene, it at least delivers crisp snaps for a 2MP sensor. 
Wrapping up, the 13MP selfie camera performs adequately in bright scenes but poorly in even slightly low light, needing a super steady hand for a clear shot. 
Video is probably one of the phones high points, captured at Full HD and stabilised nicely. Dim the lights and the quality drops, but so long as you stick with the main camera and don’t switch to the ultrawide, it’s competitive.

Moto G30 Battery Life – All-day and all night battery gives the Moto G30 an edge


Impressive 5000mAh battery



Charges at 15W, ships with a 20W charger

Powers up from empty in around two hours


With 5000mAh of battery power tucked away behind the shimmery back of the G30, it’s little wonder the phone lasts and lasts. Motorola doesn’t get specific with its claims, but simply states “Over two days of battery”, which I can attest to after using it for an extended period. 
In addition to a 5000mAh cell, the Moto G30 supports fast charging at up to 15W, though strangely includes a 20W TurboPower charger in the box. 
Taking around two hours to charge is anything but nippy these days, but considering it might only need a charge every couple of days takes the sting out of long charge times.

Ultimately, the Moto G30 is one of the better budget mobiles for battery life, and its imperfections can, for the most part, be argued away by its low price. 
You should buy the Moto G30 if:

You value battery life, storage and a stock(ish) Android experience above all else – With its long-lasting, high-capacity battery, the Moto G30 justifies its heft by lasting a long time. It’s also one of the more stock Android experiences on the budget scene, bettered only by Nokia, who is generally less generous with its storage.

You shouldn’t buy the Moto G30 if

You have small hands and high expectations – The Moto G30 is a great budget phone, and it’s a big one at that. If you’re looking for a sleek, elegant, premium-feeling solution that fits your dainty digits, or want a series of flagship experiences, from 4K video through to a decent ultrawide camera, the Moto G30 might well leave you wanting, as will all phones that cost £160. You’ll need to stump up for the Poco X3 NFC or Realme 7.

Verdict





























 



The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus is a great Android phone with one of the best screens available right now. The only notable downside is that it doesn't offer a significant upgrade on last year’s S20 Plus, making it a hard sell for those who have bought a new handset in the past few years.



Pros

Variable refresh rate screen is one of the best on the market 
Reliable camera for casual users
 Solid gaming performance
Decent build quality



Cons

Not a huge upgrade on the Galaxy S20
Exynos version offers average battery life






Key Specifications

Review Price: £950
Chipset: Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 
Rear camera: 12MP, 64MP telephoto, 12MP ultrawide 
Front camera: 10MP
Battery size: 4800mAh 
RAM/Storage: 8GB RAM, 128/256GB storage 
Screen size: 6.7-inch, Dynamic AMOLED 
Weight: 202g


 

 
The Galaxy S21 Plus is the middle-child in Samsung’s current flagship phone lineup, sitting between the more affordable Galaxy S21 and super-expensive Galaxy S21 Ultra.
It aims to target the £1000/$1000 market, taking on big-name handsets such as the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max we reviewed last year.
It’s also an atypical release by Samsung, arriving less than a year after the Galaxy S20 Plus, which was one of the best phones I tested in 2020.
This is a blessing and a curse for the S21 Plus; it feel like a much smaller upgrade on its predecessor than most new Samsung phones that have hit the market.
It isn’t a bad phone, though. Following a week of using the S21 Plus, I found it to be a solid all-round handset that ticks all the boxes you’d expect from a flagship handset.
However, having used the older S20 Plus as my main phone between reviews, I can confirm that there isn’t enough to merit an upgrade if you’ve purchased a new flagship phone in the past two years – and here’s why.
New design

The Galaxy S21 Plus has a reworked design, with a “wraparound” camera module
The devices comes with an IP water-resistance rating
There’s no headphone jack or microSD card slot

Despite sharing a lot of common features with the older Galaxy S20 Plus, the S21 Plus has a very different design to its predecessor. It’s a similar size, measuring in at a sizable 6.7-inches diagonally, but Samsung has chosen to change the glass finish of the rear, redesigning the camera module, too.
The Galaxy S21 has a matte finish, with a camera module that wraps around the phone’s side, giving it a more integrated look.
I found the change to a matte rear positive for a few reasons. First, despite feeling heavy in hand, even when compared to the S20 Plus, the S21’s new finish makes it far easier to grip, particularly when using the device outside in the rain.
Second, this device doesn’t pick up fingerprint and smudge marks. This was a constant bugbear with the S20 family of phones: despite looking all-shiny, within seconds of taking them out of the box the devices would be covered in fingerprint marks and smudges.
The third and final reason is that it makes the phone feel better built. The Galaxy S20 Plus was a wonderfully feeling phone, but the moment I unboxed the S21 Plus, the former suddenly felt cheaper by comparison.
The rear of the S21 Plus feels robust, and during testing proved to be far more scratch-resistant, surviving an encounter with one of my cats – which took exception to it getting more attention – relatively unscathed. As has been the case with most Samsung phone, there is no case included in the box.

In addition, it also offered no flex when pressed, making it generally feel more sturdy. The IP68 water-resistant body should provide reassurance and I had no trouble with the handset surviving a London downpour.
The in-screen fingerprint sensor also continued to work flawlessly in these conditions, which is a good thing in the current climate, where face-unlocking as a verification method outdoors during a pandemic is about as useful as a third nipple.
In fact, my only issues with the design of the S21 Plus are those that applied to the S20 Plus, too. Chief among these is that the S21 Plus doesn’t come with a 3.5mm headphone jack. The only port on offer is a USB-C charge port. This year Samsung has also ditched the microSD slot across the entire S21 range.
Despite audio quality being of importance to me, I’ve made peace with the fact that the majority of phones will no longer arrive with 3.5mm jacks. As such, I now use true wireless earbuds for the daily commute and running. Like Apple, Samsung has opted to ship the Galaxy S21 Plus without earphones and a phone charger, in order to reduce its environmental footprint.
The lack of a microSD slot is a bigger blow. As a golden-oldie with a local music library, who also uses their phone to record footage for the Trusted Reviews YouTube channel, the lack of a means to upgrade my phone’s storage is a particular annoyance. This is made worse on learning the phone only comes with either 128GB (tested) or 256GB of internal storage. I’d managed to fill the 128GB version of the S21 Plus within three days of turning it on – although, in fairness, this was because I was shooting 4K video.

Screen

The Galaxy S21 Plus’ 6.7-inch screen has a variable refresh rate screen that can jump between 48-120Hz, making it one of the best for gaming
But it caps resolution at 2400 x 1080 pixels, so it’s lower-res next to most flagships
HDR performance is excellent, making it ideal for streaming movies and TV

Spec-heads will also bemoan the fact that, at first glance, the Galaxy S21 Plus screen looks like a downgrade on the S20. This is because, despite being the same size, it has a lower 2400 x 1080 resolution rather than the 3200 × 1440 of the S20.
However, in real-world use the S21’s display is actually a huge step up on the S20 Plus’ screen for one key reason: it has a variable refresh rate. This is a key feature I’ve been hammering on about since Razer made high refresh rate phone screens mainstream all the way back in 2018 with its first-gen Razer Phone.
Refresh rate refers to how many times a display renders an image every second. A higher number results in the phone feeling smoother in use and, if coupled with a similar polling rate, more responsive. The downside is that a higher refresh rate puts a much bigger drain on a device’s battery.
This is the reason, to get a 120Hz refresh rate on the older S20 Plus, you’d have to downgrade its maximum resolution. Even then, the phone would always run at 120Hz, regardless of whether the task you were doing merited the increased rate – for example, for watching movies or TV shows, which are mastered at a lower hertz. In certain situations, a lower rate is also better for saving battery life. A good example of this is always-on displays, where there’s no tangible benefit to going beyond 1Hz since the screen is simply displaying a clock or an incoming notification.
The S21’s screen doesn’t go quite as low as 1Hz, but it offers the best of both worlds by being able to intelligently switch between 48-120Hz, depending on the process running on the phone.
This meant I was able to benefit from the 120Hz when playing games such as CoD Mobile or PUBG (during gaming, the increased rate actually helped me play better by reducing the time between pressing an on-screen command and it being rendered), without having to unnecessarily drain the battery while watching Netflix.
Screen quality has also seen an improvement, with the phone’s out-of-the-box profile looking noticeably cooler, and as a result more balanced than the S20 Plus. The use of AMOLED ensures blacks are wonderfully inky, and the phone’s incredibly high maximum brightness and HDR support meant that Netflix and Amazon Prime content looked wonderfully immersive. Watching Bosch in HDR, the cityscape was full of details you’d miss on most cheaper phone displays.
The only minor downside is that, unlike the £100/$100 more expensive Galaxy S21 Ultra, the Plus’ screen doesn’t support Samsung’s S Pen stylus. Although, considering I barely use the feature when reviewing Samsung Note phones, this isn’t a huge deal for me personally.

Performance

The Galaxy S21 Plus comes with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 CPU
Both offer decent performance, but the Exynos version isn’t as power-efficient

The Galaxy S21 Plus is available with two different chip options. Depending on the region you’re in, you’ll find it housing either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 (tested) CPU, but both versions have 5G modems and come paired with 8GB of RAM. So, although there are flagships available with more memory, the S21 Plus is on a par with the majority of 2021 and late-2020 handsets in the same price bracket.
However, past experience has shown there to be a significant difference between the user experience of a Samsung device with a Qualcomm chip and one with the Exynos unit. The latter devices have been found to be less power-efficient than their Qualcomm rivals. I’ve only had a chance to test the Exynos version of the Galaxy S21 Plus, and my experience mirrors that of mobile editor Max Parker reviewing the base S21 and S21 Ultra.
This means the Galaxy S21 Plus proved more than powerful enough to deal with every process I threw at it. The phone managed to easily run PUBG with its graphics settings maxed with the adaptive refresh rate turned on. It also blitzed through basic video editing when I was cutting down footage for our video producer. Photo editing in Photoshop Express ran smoothly, too, and through my time with the phone so far I’m yet to find a process the S21 Plus can’t handle.
The only time I noticed any issue was on running the 3DMark Wild Life stress test on repeat. This is a 20-minute stint designed to push a phone’s chip to its absolute limits. On the third run through, I noticed heat rise to the point the Galaxy S21 Plus felt warm to the touch and was getting close to CPU throttling.
Aside from that, the handset performed as expected throughout the benchmark tests, roughly matching the performance of its S21 siblings. This makes the Galaxy S21 Ultra one of the most powerful phones on the market. You can see how it scored in each test in the table below.
Camera

The S21 Plus has a near-identical camera setup to the S20 Plus, for image quality that’s good, but not best-in-class
Differences are down to how images are processed and the ability to shoot video in 8K at 30fps

The Galaxy S21 Plus comes with a near-identical camera setup to its predecessor. Around the back you’ll find a tri-camera comprising a 12-megapixel main, 64-megapixel telephoto and 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensors. Round the front is a 10-megapixel camera in a central hole-punch placement in the screen. The only minor difference is that Samsung has opted to remove the ToF (time of flight) sensor seen in the S20 Plus’ rear camera.
Putting the rear camera through its paces, I found that in its Auto setting, performance was – for the most part – identical to that of the S20 Plus. The camera is excellent, and more than good enough to capture crystal-clear images for use on social media, or to take the odd selfie.
In reasonable light the camera performs well, with the main sensor proving wonderfully reactive and offering fast autofocus speeds. The Portrait mode also manages to produce a much better bokeh effect than that seen of many rival phones, such as the OnePlus 8T. Bokeh is a cool effect where the object in the foreground is in focus, but the background is blurred.
Colours are also reasonably realistic, although, like the S20 Plus, processing does over-sharpen images ever so slightly. The only mainstream handsets to consistently match or beat the S21 Plus Ultra on image quality are the iPhone 12 Pro Max, Pixel 5 and Huawei P40 Pro Plus, which remain the best camera phones on the market.
The camera is also quite capable in low light, but not on a par with the ruling Pixel 5. In the main, images taken in low light are usable and noise-free – but, like all phone cameras, the unit struggled in mixed light conditions, with bright street lamps or car headlights occasionally appearing overexposed.
I also remain unsold on Samsung’s hybrid zoom tech. It claims to use processing wizardry and the multiple lenses to let you, in theory, take usable photos at up to 30x zoom. However, through testing I never once managed to capture a great shot at 30x zoom, even when using a GorillaPod. Results are better when limited to 10x zoom. At this setting I was able to get usable shots without blur free-handed.

The only significant differences between the S21 Plus and S20 Plus I noticed came down to minor software tweaks and optimisations. For starters, the S21 Plus can now capture 8K footage at 30fps, rather than 24fps. However, when you consider how quickly capturing 4K at 60fps consumes storage, I can’t see most people taking advantage of the feature.
The more useful addition is the new Director’s View mode. This lets you capture images and footage using the front and rear cameras simultaneously. The idea here being that if you’re a YouTuber or blogger looking to chronicle your lockdown life, then you can do so easily using the S21 Plus.

Battery

The Galaxy S21 Plus will survive a day’s heavy use with battery to spare
Charging plug isn’t included

My biggest concern about the S21 Plus was battery life. This is a result of my past experience with Exynos chipsets, which have struggled to make it through a full day of heavy use. As such, my expectations were low.
Thankfully, my experience with the Exynos S21 Plus hasn’t been as poor as expected. Using it as my primary phone, I have found that the handset easily makes it through a full day of constant use. This entails regularly checking social media and email feeds throughout the day, sporadic web browsing, taking and making a few calls, an hour’s gaming over lunch, and a Netflix binge before bed. In this scenario, I generally awoke the following day with about 30-40% battery remaining, having started at 100% the morning before. Such stamina is on a par with most phones of this size.
However, as ever, more intensive tasks will put a bigger drain on the phone’s battery. Streaming Netflix with the screen set to 50% brightness, which is roughly 175-200-nits, the Galaxy S21 Plus discharged an average of 5-6% of its charge per hour. Playing PUBG with the same brightness and the adaptive screen mode turned on saw an average drain of 10% per hour.
Charge times will vary depending on the plugs you have lying around. The Galaxy S21 Plus supports charge speeds of up to 25W, which puts it behind rivals from the likes of OnePlus, Xiaomi and Oppo, which offer speedier proprietary fast-charge solutions. Nevertheless, with a compatible plug I found that topping up the Galaxy S21 Plus was more than fast enough, with it going from 0-100% within an hour.

You should buy if


You haven’t upgraded your device in the past three years
If you’re a fan of Samsung phones, and you haven’t upgraded your device in the past few years, then the Galaxy S21 Plus is a solid option. It doesn’t have one killer feature, but by getting all the basics right, it earns its standing as one of 2021’s best all-round Android phones.


You’re a gamer
The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus is a great choice for gamers. Its variable refresh rate screen lets you enjoy super-fast, responsive gameplay, without having to sacrifice battery life along the way.


You shouldn’t buy if


You’ve bought a flagship in the past two years
If it’s been less than two years since you bought your last phone, and weren’t tempted by the older S20 Plus, then there’s little reason to jump on the S21 Plus. It’s a 0.5 upgrade that refines and tweaks the formula Samsung debuted last year, rather than rethinking it entirely.

Verdict




























 



The Realme 6i is a beautifully designed smartphone that on the surface offers a compelling set of features, including a long-lasting battery and capable gaming performance at a budget price. 

However, the camera is disappointing: while the quad layout is fantastic in some settings, the quality can be inconsistent – in low light, macro and zoom images fall short. Considering the Realme 7 offers higher specs at a similar price, it’s tough to recommend the Realme 6i to anyone looking beyond the basics.




Pros

Nice-looking display 
Eye-catching design 
Good battery life 



Cons

Camera is very hit and miss 
The Realme 7 offers better value at its price






Key Specifications

Review Price: £189
6.5-inch HD+ display 
Helio G80 processor 
48MP AI quad camera 
5,000mAh battery and 18W quick charge 
4GB RAM and 128GB storage 



The Realme 6i is an affordable smartphone that makes promises far beyond its budget-friendly price.
The cheapest phone in Realme’s 6 series, the 6i sits below the Realme 6 and the Realme 6 Pro. For £30 more than the 6i, the 6 takes advantage of a smooth 90Hz display and 64-megapixel quad camera, while the near-£300 6 Pro boasts a similar setup along with a Snapdragon 720G processor and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens.
In terms of price, the 6i also sits just above the recently announced Realme 7 and firmly in the price range we look for when judging the best cheap phones. We were impressed by the 7 as a budget mobile gaming device, awarding it four and half stars. The 7 similarly packs a Helio gaming processor, 48-megapixel quad camera, 5,000mAh battery, plus the addition of a 90Hz display.

With just £10 between the 6i and 7 phones, is it still worth paying more for the 6i? Read on to find out how the smartphone performs.
Realme 6i design and display – An optical illusion on the back


The HD+ display looks great but misses out on a faster refresh rate


The vertical ripple design on the rear makes this phone stand out 


The 6i includes a fingerprint scanner 


The Realme 6i is an eye-catching phone. The front is almost entirely encompassed by a 6.5-inch HD+ display, with a small bezel at the bottom of the screen and a tiny dot-drop selfie camera in the top centre. This offers the phone a modern look that’s comparable to many flagships on the market right now.
The display is sharp and colourful, making it a joy to use. However, scrolling can feel slow compared to other handsets. This wouldn’t ordinarily be an issue on such a cheap Android phone, but the Realme 7 offers a smoother 90Hz experience at a similar price. Although the fast refresh rate on the 7 is rare for such a phone in its price range, it results in the 6i’s display paling somewhat next to it.

The rear of the phone showcases a unique vertical ripple design that in the light almost appears 3D. The device is available in two colours: White Milk and Green Tea. I got my hands on the latter; it’s a deep forest green shade with a soft matte finish.
The lightweight, plastic rear has a paper-like feel and does a fantastic job of repelling any unsightly fingerprint marks. The ripple pattern is interrupted by a responsive fingerprint scanner in the centre, while a vertical camera module in the upper-left corner houses the phone’s four sensors.
On the sides of the 6i, you’ll see volume buttons and a power button, while the USB-C charging port and headphone jack can be found along the bottom of the phone.
Realme 6i camera – Takes great pictures half of the time


The 48-megapixel primary lens is crisp and punchy


The camera performs significantly better in natural daylight than low light or indoor settings


The macro lens is bright, but noisy and difficult to focus


The 48-megapixel AI quad camera is arguably the Realme 6i’s headline feature – which is the reason the hit and miss quality is so disappointing.
48MP camera
As mentioned, the camera includes a 48-megapixel primary shooter with an aperture of f/1.8, a B&W portrait lens with an f/2.4 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle lens with a 119-degree FOV and an aperture of f/2.3. Finally there’s a 2-megapixel macro lens with a 4cm focus and an f/2.4 aperture. The phone supports video recording at up to 1080p at 30fps.
The 48-megapixel lens is the most impressive of the bunch, offering crisp detail, intense contrast and punchy colours. I enjoyed the images captured with this lens and it quickly became my favourite to shoot with.
Default camera
48MP camera
Then there’s the front camera. I was really impressed with the 16-megapixel lens in daylight; the camera offered plenty of detail and bright, eye-catching colours, pumping my faded turquoise hair up to a vivid blue. However, the results were significantly less flattering in low-light conditions and indoors, causing my skin to look dull and washed out once the sun went down.
The rear portrait lens offers a similar outcome to the selfie camera – albeit with a bit more detail – while the 119-degree wide-angle lens was a welcome addition, offering a level of contrast comparable with the 48-megapixel lens with more space in the frame.
Low light
I encountered the biggest issues with the 6i’s camera when using the macro lens and snapping pics indoors. I struggled to get the macro camera to focus on the subject for taking close-ups, and the quality suffered significantly in low light and indoor settings, resulting in little detail, washed-out colours and over-sharpened results when compared with photos taken in daylight. Zoom performance was poor as well.
Macro
If you prefer to take photos outdoors and in the daylight, you’ll be impressed with what this quad camera setup delivers for less than £200. However, night owls and smartphone photographers should beware.
Realme 6i performance – A cheap gaming phone


Realme claims the processor offers a performance and graphics boost over previous phones 


The handset is fast and responsive during gameplay 


There’s space for the storage to be upgraded 


The 6i was the first phone released to pack the Helio G80 chipset. According to Realme, the octa-core, 2.0GHz CPU offers a 35% performance boost over the previous generation, while the 1,000MHz Mali G52 GPU is 25% better than its predecessor.
I found these numbers matched with my real-world results. The phone is fast and responsive while gaming, although this is one more area in which a faster refresh rate would really shine. Regardless, the G80 chip makes the 6i a great option for anyone on the hunt for an affordable gaming device.
As far as overall performance is concerned, I found that the 4GB of RAM of the review model offered enough speed to navigate and switch between apps at a decent rate – although, of course, not in the same league as higher priced phones. Nevertheless, if you’re on the hunt for reliable, affordable performance, then the 6i is a great option.

RAM and storage options include 3GB to 4GB and 64GB to 128GB. There’s also space for up to two SIM cards and one microSD card in the card slot, affording the option to upgrade the storage further.
Realme 6i battery life – Days of use


The 6i packs a huge 5,000mAh battery and claims to offer 39 days of standby 


The phone can go for days without being charged with regular use 


It also includes support for 18W quick charge and reverse charging 


Battery life is one area in which the 6i shines. Realme packs a hefty 5000mAh battery into the device, which claims to offer an incredible 39 days of standby time.
Of course, this number is dramatically shorter when the phone is in use. I found it easy to go a night without plugging in the device to charge – a feat that feels near-impossible with my usual iPhone XR.
The phone also offers 18W quick-charge for gaining power at speed, support for reverse charging, plus it’s compatible with USB Type-C which still isn’t always a given at this price.
I found it was able to hit 50% battery in under an hour and a full charge in about 2hrs 30mins.
You should buy the Realme 6i if

You want a basic phone that offers reliable performance 

The Realme 6i offers a great all-round experience, but doesn’t outperform rivals featured in our best budget phone guide. However, if you’re looking for a phone that delivers solid performance for browsing or gaming, takes great photos outdoors and offers a long battery life, you won’t be disappointed.

You want a big battery 

One standout feature on the Realme 6i is its sizeable battery. If you want a phone that will last for multiple days without requiring a charge, the 6i is a good choice. Fast-charge and reverse-charging are also compelling additions.

You want a eye-catching design 

One of my favourite aspects of the Realme 6i is its unique, light-shifting, vertical ripple design. While this shouldn’t be the main reason for opting for this phone, it’s certainly a must for those who want a device that stands out from all the iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices crowding the streets.

You should not buy the Realme 6i if

You need a versatile camera 

It’s especially unfortunate that the camera falls short given how well-kitted out the quad setup appears to be at first glance.
While the 48-megapixel main lens will be sufficient for most casual photo-takers, the camera will fall short for a dedicated smartphone photographer. The camera’s abilities are limited in low light and indoor environments, and its macro and zoom shots are filled with noise.

You want the best possible display

This point may seem counter-intuitive given the display is listed as one of our pros at the start of this review. However, while the 6i’s sharp and vivid screen is attractive on the surface, other phones in Realme’s line-up pack faster refresh rates. This means they can offer smoother scrolling and more polished gaming performance for a similar price.

You want the best value for your money 

The 6i performs incredibly well for its price, thanks to the Helio G80 chipset. However, if you’re looking for a cheap gaming phone with a similar set of features, consider the Realme 7. It’s packed with the newer G95 chip, more generous RAM options, and a faster 90Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and gameplay – all for £10 less than the Realme 6i.

Verdict




























 



A lot of compromises have been made to produce a 5G-ready phone that can retail at the same price as the TCL 10 Pro, resulting in a device that simply can't keep up where it counts. The TCL 10 5G might have some allure to those who want a fast performing phone at a reasonable price, but the downgraded screen, lacklustre cameras and some niggling bugs and design quirks, are simply too difficult to overlook – particularly when there are better 5G phones out there at a cheaper price.



Pros

Great performance owed to the Qualcomm chipset
Long-lasting battery



Cons

Lacklustre cameras
Downgraded screen from the TCL 10 Pro
Bluetooth issues






Key Specifications

Review Price: £399
Quad-camera module
6.53-inch FHD+ LCD display
Qualcomm® Kryo™ Octa-Core CPU
128GB storage
6GB RAM
4500mAh battery
Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 765G
Dimensions: 163.65 x 76.56 x 9.05mm



The aptly named TCL 10 5G is the tech giant’s most expensive smartphone and its first step into the world of 5G connectivity. But rather than target the same flagship market as the uber-expensive iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy S21 Ultra its sights are aimed at the mid-range market dominated by great value handsets like the Pixel 4a 5G. 
This could make it sound like a great handset, especially as last year we found ourselves to be quite impressed with TCL’s first self-branded entry into the world of smartphones: the TCL 10 Pro. After working through brands like Blackberry and Alcatel for years, the TV manufacturer finally threw its name into the ring and the results were impressive. Despite its £399.99 price point, the phone managed to cram in a great deal of features, including fast processing, an OLED display and a gorgeous camera system that was embedded within the phone’s chassis.
However, after a few weeks with the new phone, I sadly can confirm lightning has not struck twice with the TCL 10 5G. Here’s why.
TCL 10 5G – Price
With the 10 5G, it’s clear that TCL is modelling the phone as a direct alternative to the TCL 10 Pro. The TCL 10 5G retails at £399.99 (roughly $546/€451), the same price that’s currently slapped on the Pro.

While these phones have been designed to appeal to the exact same corner of the market, they differ greatly in the areas they excel in, so the process of deciding which phone to go with will depend entirely on which features you find more valuable.
Design and Screen – a step down in both areas for the TCL 10 5G

Unlike the TCL 10 Pro, the 10 5G’s camera module is not embedded in the chassis
The display has been downgraded to an IPS LCD screen panel 
There’s a dedicated button for calling the Google Assistant

One of the defining features of the TCL 10 Pro was its gorgeous design, which seamlessly integrated the wide camera module into the body itself, creating a style entirely its own. You can imagine my disappointment then when, after unboxing the TCL 10 5G, I was greeted with a wide (albeit slim) camera bump instead.
Still, the phone retains a glass back and an aluminium frame, both of which combine to form a decent weight in the hand that certainly makes the TCL 10 5G feel more expensive than it actually is, even when compared to the more expensive, but plastic backed, Galaxy S21. On the back, there’s also a very subtle gradient chance that occurs as your eyes move towards the bottom of the phone. It’s hardly the most eye-catching design I’ve ever seen, but it is a nice bit of added flair, particularly if you pick up the Chrome Blue option.
Audiophiles will be glad to know that the TCL 10 5G comes with a 3.5mm headphone input for lossless playback, but even rarer is a dedicated button on the phone’s left-hand side that activates the Google Assistant. As a frequent user of the Google Assistant, having an immediate trigger has been quite helpful, but for whatever reason the button’s function can’t be customised to open a different app instead. I’m all for having a few more buttons than the standard power/volume combo, but this feels like a missed opportunity. I suppose you can always ask Google Assistant for the app you really want to use.
Keeping costs down when making a 5G phone is still tricky, but from the moment I turned the phone on it was clear screen quality was the first area TCL cut designing the 10 5G. While the TCL 10 5G’s display is slightly larger at 6.53-inches, the previous phone’s OLED panel has been replaced with a dimmer IPS LCD display. It’s not the worst compromise I’ve come across, but it is disappointing that the 10 5G lacks the visual flare of the 10 Pro.

To remedy this, TCL has included has included the NXTVISION app, which analyses what’s on screen and adjusts the colour and contrast to make the image appear brighter and less dim than what you might find on smartphones with a similar display. The uptick is definitely noticeable, but it doesn’t come close to matching the prowess of an OLED panel, which offers better blacks and a generally more dynamic experience.
As a side note, if you plan on watching any content on the TCL 10 5G then make sure you’ve got a decent pair of headphones because the bottom facing speakers are about as dull as they could possibly be. Audio feels flat and the one-sided output isn’t ideal for conveying any discernible layering.
Camera – a decent main snapper that’s flanked by digital deadweight

The main 64MP sensor can take social-media ready shots under the right conditions
Detail on the ultra-wide is so poor that it’s not worth using
A random pop-up implores you to keep your hands away from the sensors, even when there’s a noticeable distance between them

Just like the 10 Pro before it, the TCL 10 5G has a quad-camera set-up but with a slightly downgraded ultra-wide option. This time you have a 64MP main sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 2MP depth-sensor and everyone’s favourite, a 5MP macro camera.
As tends to be the case with phones this price, the allure of multiple cameras is tempting, but what you end up with is a bunch of underwhelming sensors as opposed to a single sensor that performs well, much like with the Pixel 4a.
On a bright, sunny day, the TCL 10 5G can take colourful shots
Luckily for the TCL 10 5G, the camera offering isn’t a complete disaster, with the 64MP main sensor able to do a decent job under certain conditions. Taking the TCL 10 5G with you on a sunny day, it is possible to get some great pictures that not only absorb the colour well, but also know exactly how to process the brightness of the sky.
The main sensor can handle oncoming light surprisingly well
A good amount of detail is lost with the ultra-wide lens, and you can spot blurring on the market lettering
In most instances, these pictures are great for social media where they’ll be viewed on a small screen, but any attempt to zoom in on an image will immediately reveal the lack of available detail. The situation’s even worse when you swap to the ultra-wide sensor, as image detail takes an even greater hit to the point where blurring around the edges is visible without zooming in.
Around the edges, the ultra-wide sensor struggles to stay focused
The phone’s night mode, or ‘super night’ as its listed in the camera app, only seeks to continue this trend. To its credit, the dedicated night mode can light up the ground of a dimly-lit shot quite well, but it struggles in adapting the sky and anything that could potentially be blended in with it.
A low light setting with night mode switched on
The same setting with night mode switched off
To make matters worse, there is a warning message that appears completely at random, telling the user not to cover any of the sensors on the back of the phone. This message interrupted my picture taking numerous times, particularly outdoors, when my fingers were no-where near the sensors in question. And yet, attempts to capture the pop-up by smooshing my hand all over the cameras brought no results, and there’s no way of switching off the warning in the settings.
Performance – a smooth experience, helped along by a competent chipset

The Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset yields impressive results
Gaming on the TCL 10 5G is a blast
Bluetooth connection problems persisted throughout testing

Until now, it’s likely been easy to get the impression that the TCL 10 5G is universally inferior to the 10 Pro, but this isn’t the case where performance is concerned. This is due to the 10 5G coming packed with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset.
Even though the display is running at 60Hz, movement throughout the phone’s UI feels fast and responsive, giving the impression of a device that’s much higher up the chain where price is concerned. In benchmarking tests, the TCL 10 5G received a high single-core score of 602, and a decent multi-core score of 1880 – the likes of which are atypical for a phone at this end of the market.
This power under the hood ensured that the TCL 10 5G could handle most of what I wanted to throw at it. Diving into some online matches in Call of Duty Mobile proved to be no problem at all, and the same goes for jumping between various messaging apps on the go. Where the TCL 10 5G did stumble was in trying to maintain a constant Bluetooth connection.
Throughout my testing, the 10 5G would inexplicably drop all Bluetooth connections at random, only to reconnect moments later. The frequency at which this issue would appear also changed at random which, for a person like me who enjoys listening to podcasts for long stretches of time, was a frustrating problem that I could gladly do without.

Aside from the Bluetooth issue, the rest of my experience was fine, and helped along by TCL’s largely hassle-free take on the Android OS. This isn’t to say that the TCL launcher is particularly eye-catching – it pales in comparison to stock Android and Oxygen OS – but it’s largely free of bloatware, and there are several visual options to make things easier on the eyes, including eye-comfort mode, reading mode and dark mode.
Battery – under moderate use, you can see up to two days with the TCL 10 5G

With moderate use, it’s easy to get two days out of the TCL 10 5G
From 0%, it takes roughly two hours to reach a full charge

Even though the TCL 10 5G has the same 4500mAh battery found in the 10 Pro, the juice goes a lot further this time around as it doesn’t have to worry about powering a more premium display. As a result, the 10 5G easily outperforms its sibling in this area.
In my testing, the TCL 10 5G was able to go through a whole day, plus 13 hours (two hours and 36 minutes of which were screen on time), before needing to be hooked up for the nearest charger. Of course, heavier use will likely result in the 10 5G needing a charge first thing the next morning, but it’s nice to know that you can get through an entire day without worry.
Just be mindful if you’re in a hurry however, as a full charge will take two hours of your time. A speedier charging process would’ve been nice, but it’s hard to argue with in relation to the low asking price of the phone to begin with.
You should buy the TCL 10 5G if
1. You want an affordable 5G phone
At just £399.99, the TCL 10 5G offers up one of the cheaper ways to get onboard the 5G bandwagon. Sure, it’s not as cheap as the Moto G 5G Plus, but it’s still on the affordable side of things when you compare it to flagships from the likes of Apple and Samsung.
2. You value performance over all
The TCL 10 5G might be lacking in a number of places, but performance isn’t one of them. The included Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset is a powerful beast, allowing the phone to handle everyday tasks with ease.
3. You need a battery that can go the distance
Under the right circumstances, you can easily get two days worth of use out of the TCL 10 5G, making it a handy device to have if you’re going to be away from a power outlet for a decent portion of time.
You should not buy the TCL 10 5G if
1. You want a competent camera experience
Even though the phone totes a total of four rear-facing cameras, it’s only the main 64MP sensor that takes any shots that are worth sharing. Detail is so lacking in the ultra-wide sensor that it’s not worth using at all, and I’d sooner recommend one of the similarly priced Pixel phones.
2. You use your phone primarily for watching content
Disappointingly, the TCL 10 5G uses an IPS LCD display which just isn’t as vibrant or well suited for watching content on the go as an OLED alternative. What’s irritating is that you can find OLED displays on much cheaper devices, so it’s a hard pill to swallow here.
3. You want a more exciting take on Android
While the experience isn’t weighed down by bloatware, TCL’s Android launcher is fairly milquetoast compared to what’s available on Pixel and OnePlus smartphones. It might not seem like the most important quality, but a more developed UI can go a long way to making you feel more confident with your purchase.

Verdict































Once again, Huawei produces a beautiful smartphone to appeal to the Google-avoiders and geeks who are up for some sideloading. If that’s you, the Mate 40 Pro’s expansive screen, rich design, nippy interface and excellent camera will leave you grinning from ear to ear. For everyone else, the Google-shaped potholes that become apparent across a typical day and the high price will likely result in one too many compromises to take the plunge. 



Pros
Great screenExcellent camera systemLoud, expansive speakers


Cons
No Google servicesCan get warm when gamingUltra-wide camera could be widerNot available easily in the USA


Key Specifications
Review Price: £1099.9950Mp camera Kirin 9000 5G 5nm chipset 88-degree OLED display 66w charging



Huawei’s Mate 40 Pro is an expensive Android smartphone at £1099/$NA/€1200. Instantly, a bar is set: it has to include best-in-class features to justify the price. Huawei also has an extra hurdle to overcome – the lack of Google Play Services being one. 
The implications of the latter are far-reaching: from game saves to WhatsApp backups, if you’re not coming from a Google-free phone already, you’ll have to rethink your mobile life. 
However, if any phone is likely to encourage you to do it, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro would be it and this stands as one of best phones and best Android phones in certain respects.
While the Huawei Mate 40 Pro is available through retailers in the UK and Europe, it is not easily available in the USA.
Design 

The Mate 40 Pro is certainly distinctive
Huawei’s largest mainstream flagship yet
Very curved look
USB-C for charging

Fans of big phones rejoice. If you were expecting the compact form of the Pixel 5, or the iPhone 12 mini micro-appeal, then you’re not getting it here. The Mate 40 Pro is Huawei’s largest mainstream flagship to date, measuring 9.1mm thick. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is 7.4mm thick by comparison. Despite the extra thickness here, Apple’s device remains heavier by about 15g, and both taller and wider. Nevertheless, it should provide you with a point of comparison.
From the front, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro brings back a strikingly curved ‘waterfall’ display, similar to that introduced on its predecessor, the Mate 30 Pro. Unlike the Mate 30 Pro, however, this time Huawei ditches the notch and brings back the physical volume button on the phone’s right side. 
On the upper-left of the screen is a chunky pill-shaped cutout for the front-camera system, which also face-unlocks your phone, takes some of the best selfies around, and keeps the screen on so long as you’re glancing at it. 
The Huawei Mate 40 Pro screen is book-ended by uniform bezels top and bottom, but the left and right bezels are virtually invisible owing to that curve. 

Along the phone’s bottom is a loudspeaker, a USB-C port and a SIM tray, which doubles up as a nano memory card slot. You’ll find all the buttons along the left edge, while up top is an infrared blaster and the second speaker. 
Available in two finishes in the UK, the glass back of the Mate 40 Pro can be had in a matte, demure pearlesque Mystic Silver, or Black in the UK. In other regions, it’s also available in ceramic (black or white) and vegan leather (green or yellow) versions.
Huawei can be relied upon for excellent fit and finish. From the Mate 40 Pro’s polished metal frame, the assurance of IP68 water-resistance, through to the relatively smudge-proof matte glass back, everything looks and feels great. We also appreciate the phone’s bold styling, in-part a result of the circular camera system taking pride of place. With Leica branding sitting proud, alongside four cameras and a dual-LED flash, it’s clear that the Mate 4 Pro’s snapper means business before you even fire it up.  
Screen

90Hz +456PPI: Great on paper but the Huawei Mate 40 Pro is stunning in the flesh
Ticks all the boxes we look for in a display
Very slim bezel
Not quite the best display going, but among them

Sporting a 6.76-inch screen, the Mate 40 Pro’s display is a fraction larger than that of an iPhone 12 Pro Max. That said, it looks and feels much broader, owing to a more squat aspect ratio. Featuring slimmer bezels to the left and right than virtually any other device on the scene, it has a 94.1% screen-to-body ratio. That’s compared to the 12 Pro Max’s 87.4%, and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s 91.7%.
The Mate 40 Pro’s screen also comes packing some decent specs. An OLED panel, with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 1344 x 2772 pixel resolution, the display here is as sharp as an iPhone with a pixel density of 456ppi. There are sharper panels to be seen in the Android camp, but once you go above 400ppi, additional clarity becomes much of a muchness. 
Offering excellent viewing angles, colour reproduction, brightness levels and enjoyable-in-the-dark minimum brightness, there’s very little we’d change about the Mate 40 pro’s screen. While Huawei tends to lean towards the cooler side of the white balance spectrum, an eye-comfort mode warms things up nicely.

In addition, the 18.5:9 aspect ratio is a great middle-ground between the ultra-wide 21:9 movie aspect ratio of the Sony Xperia 5 II, and the traditional TV show aspect ratio of 16:9. 
Responsive to the touch, loaded up with a pre-fitted screen protector and a pleasure to navigate, the only area we’d give the Mate 40 Pro a bit of a boost is that refresh rate. While still iPhone-beating at 90Hz, it’s just a smidgen behind the latest from OnePlus, Oppo and Samsung. You won’t notice the difference unless swiping side-by-side with a 120Hz phone, but it is noticeable once you do.  
Performance and Google

Ample oomph, storage and smarts
No Google apps or services
Instead there’s the App Gallery, which is still short of big UK apps
Latest 5nm 5G chipset

The Mate 40 Pro is powered by a Kirin 9000 5G chipset – Huawei’s own brand of silicon. The Kirin 9000 is a 5nm octa-core chip that combines a high clock-speed core with three mid-level clocked cores, and four lower-clocked cores. The result, according to Huawei, is maximum power and maximum power-saving.
While popular benchmark apps don’t run on the Mate 40 Pro (an issue encountered on a number of phones from Motorola through to Nokia), it’s easy to confirm that when it comes to speed, the Mate 40 Pro presented no issues at all for gaming and general day-to-day use. 
Playback in games such as Genshin Impact at highest graphics settings (60fps) was beautiful, with the huge screen joining forces with the wide open sound from the stereo speakers to deliver a fantastic open-world experience.  
Genshin Impact is an example of a game that works well in this Google-free environment. It supports multiple login options – Twitter, Google, or a Mihoyo account – and so doesn’t require Google Play Games. If all titles were similar, then gamers wouldn’t be compromising with the Huawei Mate 40 Pro. However, other popular titles such as Injustice 2 that require Google Play saves won’t let you port across your game data from your old smartphone. 
Also worth noting is that with intense games the Mate 40 Pro can become warm with long bouts of gameplay. I didn’t encounter heat management issues when using the phone for anything else – camera use or extended messaging, for example – and it’s better than the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra for gaming, but if you’re an avid player hankering after hours of action, it’s worth bearing in mind.
The Mate 40 Pro comes with 256GB of storage, as well as Huawei’s own nano memory card solution, so there’s ample space for all your files.
Despite launching a few months ago and running EMUI 11, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro still runs Android 10, which isn’t the latest version of Google’s mobile OS. However, this doesn’t really affect the UI you end up interacting with, given how heavily customised Huawei’s interface is.

EMUI is great in some respects. The Mate 40 Pro’s is the best implementation of eye-monitoring, for example, so even if you put the phone down, so long as you’re looking at it, the screen will remain on. Look away, and it turns off. 
Such eye smarts aren’t an isolated highlight. From knuckle-tap screen grabs to smart integration with Huawei laptops, EMUI is heavy, but it’s also very well thought out. You can even hook it to a TV or monitor for a desktop UI, similar to Samsung’s DeX system – and, in general, interaction with the phone is stable, smooth and feels fast.
That said, no matter how good EMUI is, the lack of Google services is an issue. What’s even more concerning for seasoned geeks is that it’s proving harder to hack Google services onto a Huawei device. Practically speaking, unless you’re actively trying to avoid Google, the Mate 40 Pro is going to be a series of insurmountable compromises sprinkled atop of an otherwise great smartphone. 
The areas in which you’ll feel the lack of Google most are with Google’s apps: Google Docs, Drive, Meet and YouTube, to name a few. The extent to how far this reaches can’t be overstated. For example, WhatsApp backups use Google Drive, so you won’t be able to transfer old WhatsApp history onto your new Mate 40 Pro. I’ve covered game saves already – and, it goes without saying, if your business runs with Google for Business services, the calendar won’t integrate with the device calendar; Google Meet won’t work; and there’s no Docs editing for you, either.
Of course, there are workarounds – but when you’re spending £1099/$NA/€1200, do you really want to be faffing with hacks just so you can dial into a Google Meet conference call on your phone?
Camera

One of the best camera phones of all time
Typical high-quality Huawei cameras with excellent low-light performance
A look akin to Leica cameras
Stable video at 4K

Huawei’s phones have been among the best camera phones around for a few years now, and in this regard nothing changes with the Mate 40 Pro. At the helm is a 50-megapixel f/1.9 camera; identical to the one included with the excellent Huawei P40 Pro Plus. Alongside it sits a P40 Pro-a-like 12-megapixel f/3.4 5x zoom periscope camera, and a 20-megapixel f/1.8 ultra-wide.

While most ultra-wide cameras are 13mm, the Mate 40 Pro’s focal length is 18mm, making it just a little wider than the 23mm main camera. This is unlikely to be a deal-breaker, but the similar focal lengths across cameras do hold back the system’s versatility. On the plus, the ultra-wide camera lens comes with manual focus and can grab macro photos, which is a boon.
As for pure photo quality, Huawei’s look is arguably Leica’s look, with photos taken on the Mate 40 Pro definitely exhibiting similar characteristics. Images are warm, rich and zingy, without looking mottled and over-processed like some photos taken on Samsung phones. As such, the majority will enjoy the balance the cameras achieve.


Detail is generally rich across all cameras, and while there’s no 10x optical zoom as found on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, in well-lit scenes, photos are usable up to around 30x zoom, which is incredibly impressive and you can see in the sample images below.
Dynamic range is strong even in backlit scenes, and challenging subjects such as black cats and glass look textured and realistic. Huawei’s Auto mode is also the best around when it comes to low-light photography, saving you from having to switch to Night mode. 




As for video capture, footage is shot primarily using the ultra-wide 20-megapixel camera, which Huawei refers to as the phone’s Cine Camera. With 4K resolution at a maximum of 60fps, the numbers are competitive, even if they can’t topple Samsung’s 8K-resolution Galaxy S21 series. 
The results impress, though, with footage looking crisp, stable, and a nippy autofocus. The camera also grabs decent background blur when shooting close-up objects, something few smartphones can achieve in video. In middling light, the Mate 40 Pro holds its own, shooting with a softened image. However, as is the case with all smartphones, when the lights drop all the way, grain takes over. 
The only camera phone we’d pick over the Mate 40 Pro in certain scenes is the iPhone 12 Pro Max, whose photos have a more muted, natural look that cinema-style fans will prefer. 
That said, neither phone outperforms the other in every respect, and the Mate 40 Pro is probably the best across-the-board Android phone you can buy, alongside the P40 Pro and Pro Plus. What’s more, with a slew of manual modes and RAW capture available, there’s plenty here to appeal to enthusiasts who like to tinker.
Battery life

Powers up quickly and the Huawei Mate 40 Pro lasts the day
Lasts all day
Very fast charging both wired and wireless

It isn’t surprising that the 4400mAh battery keeps the Mate 40 Pro going all day. It’s a decent capacity and Huawei has proven itself when it comes to power efficiency. More impressive is the speed at which it charges. 
Wired, it powers up at 66W – a single watt faster than Oppo’s 65W Super VOOC 2.0. However, it’s with wireless charging that it takes the lead, with 50W Qi charging. Compared to an iPhone 12 Pro Max, it powers up at over three times the rate. 
Should you buy the Huawei Mate 40 Pro?
You’ll struggle not to coo the second you pick up the Mate 40 Pro – and listening to its speakers boom as its screen sucks you in with crisp 90Hz video is sure to make you want one. Then there’s the camera – in fact, this is one of the best smartphones you can buy from a hardware point of view. 
However, with a sky-high price of £1099/$NA/€1200, you’d be expecting close to perfection, and until Huawei devices support Google Mobile Services again, perfection won’t be the reality for most. 
So, while we can’t recommend the Mate 40 Pro to the majority of readers, if you’re comfortable with the idea of ditching the big G, live in mainland China, or are confident in your sideloading skills and speak ADB fluently, the Mate 40 Pro has the potential to be a cracking phone.

Verdict


































There are sacrifices yes, but this is still a great phone for a more enticing price. It has a lovely screen, a reliable camera and a slick new design that feels a little bit futuristic. The basics are here and they’re all done excellently.



Pros
Much more affordable at launch than S20Still a great screen (and it’s flat)Snappy performance

Cons
Lack of microSD and WQHD+ resolution make it feel like an S20 downgradeDoesn’t feel as good as previous S series phonesMinimal camera upgrades

The Samsung Galaxy S21 isn’t the highest tier phone in Samsung’s current line-up, if you want that then check out the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But having thoroughly used the pared-down device, I can confirm that it ticks all the important boxes for most people. This plus its more wallet friendly price make it an excellent smartphone.
The S21 is the lowest entry point to Samsung’s flagship phone line and it comes with a few key changes to last year’s Galaxy S20. Expandable storage is gone, you’ll have to make do with a plastic rear and the screen’s resolution tops out at just FHD+. On top of that, you’ll have to spend extra for your own charger and headphones – cheers for setting this precedent last year with the iPhone 12.
Still, there’s plenty to appreciate and the Galaxy S21 is sure to be one of the best Android phones of the year, with highlights including several camera additions and a strong focus on offering buyers a unique new design and a lower than expected price tag.
We’ve got a full Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review with a full in-depth look at the spec-beast in Samsung’s range.
Price and release date
You can pre-order every version of the Samsung Galaxy S21 right now, with the handsets hitting shelves on January 29. Prices for the Samsung Galaxy S21 start at £769 €849/$799. This is a slight reduction over the outgoing Galaxy S20 which started at £899 for the 5G model. The Samsung S21 Plus will cost from £949/€1049/$999.
Both the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will be widely available through UK and US network vendors and across big sites such as Amazon. Of course, with all non-essential shops currently closed in the UK, you’ll only be able to get these phones online for now.
This is the earliest we’ve seen Samsung unveil its flagship smartphone in quite some time, with a typical release happening in March. But, with the pandemic continuing to have an impact across the globe, it looks like this year might be quite different in general.
Design and Screen

There have been some sacrifice here, including a switch to a plastic back and a drop in screen resolution
The new rear camera module is very distinctive
The phone’s light and easy to hold

Samsung’s made a few cuts to the Galaxy S21 that make it feel less “flagship” than past Samsung hero phones. Whether this is a blessing or a curse will depend on your personal expectations, but in general I think the move is the right one as it has let Samsung reduce the phone’s RRP.
There have been two notable cuts, along with a couple of other smaller bits that have been left out. The biggest, especially for those who still want this to be a high-end flagship phone, is the drop in maximum screen resolution. Specifically, Samsung’s dropped it from WQHD+ to FHD+, basically 1440p down to 1080p. While yes, you can – if you really look for it – see a difference, on a 6.2-inch panel this isn’t much of an issue for me.

That’s mostly because the rest of the display is great. It’s OLED, supremely bright, still very sharp and has an adaptive refresh rate that can drop to 48Hz and rise to 120Hz. This is a big improvement over the 120Hz panel in the S20 as it’s not wasting energy when you won’t benefit from the faster, smoother speeds.
Describing the benefit of 120Hz displays is hard as it’s something that needs to be seen to be appreciated. But realistically you’ll notice it everywhere when in use, from scrolling Twitter to playing a round of PUBG mobile. Coming to the S21 from an iPhone 12, I dislike it even more that Apple decided against implementing this tech into its latest phone, as with everyday use the S21 feels much smoother and responsive.
For the first time in ages for a mainline S series phone, the screen here is completely flat. Finally! I love a flat screen and it’s one of the reasons I am drawn to the iPhone 12. It means the S21 is so much easier to hold and generally feels a whole lot less delicate. Of all the features lost for the S21, the lack of a curved screen is more of a pro than a con for me.
The other big difference between the S21 and the outgoing Galaxy S20 is a switch to a plastic back, rather than a glass one. I was initially torn on this as I’ve always felt that glass gives off a much more high-end feel than plastic but after using the Galaxy S21 for a week, I think the shift is fine and most people likely won’t be bothered by the material change. The plastic is suitably sturdy, offering no flex.

The only drawback is that the phone does not feel quite as expensive as previous headline S series phones. Its finish is more akin to the Galaxy S20 FE rather than the main S20. It’s light, but lacks that satisfyingly weighty finish you get with glass. The back also still picks up greasy smudges even with the matte finish, which is an annoyance for neat freaks such as myself.
Yes, the back is plastic… but it looks great in Phantom Violet
While the back is plastic, the S21 still has a Gorilla Glass Victus screen and metal rails. The S21 Plus opts for an all-glass design, so that’s the one to go for if you prefer a more high-end finish.
The camera module is now very much part of the design. It sits towards the top-left of the phone, blending into the handset’s edge. I wasn’t sure about the change at first, but I quickly grew to really like the design. Too many phones just stick a large camera module on the back and design around it, whereas this feels like a cohesive unit.
Samsung also goes slightly off-book with its two-tone colour choices. The headline-grabbing “Phantom Violet” model combines a light purple colour with pinky-gold accents, which works well. There’s a gold option too, along with more modest white and black choices. If you plump for the Plus, silver will also be an option.
Another loss is microSD card expandability. This did happen once before in the S series and was quickly brought back the following year so it does seem another odd move, especially when the max 256GB storage option fills up very quickly when you’re shooting 8K video. At least we’ve still got an IP68 rating for some minor water-resistance, and a stereo speaker. 
Performance

The UK and other European versions run the Exynos 2100, while the US version packs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888
It has powerful stereo speakers and offers excellent call quality
It’s seriously powerful and great for gaming

Samsung hasn’t hamstrung the Galaxy S21 with its chipset this year, but you’ll still be getting either the top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 (US) or the Exynos 2100 (UK and other European territories). 
You’ve also got the same larger and far more reliable in-display fingerprint sensor as the S21 Ultra. This might seem a small detail, but with mask-wearing now being so common I find phones that focus on facial unlocking (basically the iPhone 12) feel out of touch and a pain to use outside at the moment.
The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a fast phone. I’ve been using the Exynos 2100 version, which is a major step-up on the previous Exynos chipsets – at least after a week of testing. The new chip shares a similar Samsung design to the older model used in the S20. This time however it has a newer GPU, with the Exynos utilising a Mali G78 and the Snapdragon 888 using the Adreno 660. We’ll have to get hold of a Snapdragon version to compare performance in this regard, but I haven’t had any issues whatsoever with the gaming performance here.
You’ll rarely encounter any lag
This is the current high-end chipset from both companies and the Galaxy S21 is one of the first phones to use them. Like Apple’s A14, they’re both built on a highly efficient 5nm process which to non-techies is a key reason why it offers improved battery life compared to the S20.
Aside from some minor bugs inside Samsung’s OneUI software, the Galaxy S21 is very fast. You won’t notice it on the daily if you’re coming from a phone from 2020 or 2019, however if you’re upgrading from an S8 or S9 then prepare to be impressed.
That’s not to say the advancement of tech under-the-hood is a waste of time. Many of the benefits of these new chips are in areas like AI, giving you faster photo enhancements for instance. 
It also powers clever camera tricks, like being able to view live video from all the cameras at once and recording 4K60 footage from different sensors simultaneously.

Samsung has stuck to 8GB RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage which cannot be expanded. 8GB RAM is fine for me and I haven’t suffered any multitasking issues, however with 8K video taking up around 1GB per 120 seconds and game sizes rising all the time, you’re probably best off paying a little more upfront and getting the higher storage option.
Another benefit these chips have over their predecessors is that the 5G modem is built-in, rather than sitting separately. All Galaxy S21 models have support for at least sub-6Ghz 5G (that’s the only one available in the UK so don’t worry about mmWave support) and you don’t need to pay extra for the 5G version as you did last year.
Camera

The main camera combines 12MP wide, 12MP ultra wide and 64MP tele lenses
Video tops out at 8K, though 4K options are more reliable
It comes with lots of new camera modes, including the ability to shoot from multiple sensors at once

If you want the best Samsung camera phone possible, then you’ll need to invest in the significantly more expensive Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. The cheaper S21 has a set-up that’s very similar to the outgoing Galaxy S20, albeit with some tweaks to the software.
As a result, if you’ve used the older phone then you won’t notice a drastic improvement in photo quality but that’s no bad thing. This is a reliable camera that performs well in a variety of environments. Highlights include good low-light performance and a very good ultra wide option. For a look at the specs, see the table below:

When you’re shooting with that main 12MP sensor with its f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilisation (OIS), the pictures are generally very pleasing. 
Testing the camera I found colours – especially reds and greens – are punchy and vivid and they look great on the S21’s OLED screen. Samsung has consistently gone for a saturated look that shines on apps like Instagram and there’s no doubting the brand knows its audience well.
You get lots of detail
 

While I haven’t been able to visit many (or any) bars recently, I have tried to recreate that distorted light look and the S21 deals with the tougher situations admirably. Enable the dedicated Night Mode and pictures have even more brightness, though with a little too much-added sharpness for my taste. Oddly, the night mode doesn’t seem to launch automatically as it does on most modern phones – you need to scroll over and turn it on manually – which is a faff. All too often I’d forget to turn it on when shooting in low light as a result.
Even if the lighting isn’t great. you’ll still get a crisp shot
The camera’s zoom skills are taken care of by a 64MP sensor. This means it just digitally crops and blows up photos to zoom in, rather than truly zooming. However, the zoom sensor’s narrow f/2.2 aperture means you’ll want to avoid using it solo in low light. 
Here, the main 12MP ultra wide is a much better option. It’s one of the best ultra-wide setups I have reviewed and is capable of capturing photos with large amounts of detail, with very little blurring at the edges and nice colours. See the images below for some examples.
The ultra-wide is great
There’s a good 10MP selfie camera that produces far more realistic and natural images than previous Samsung attempts.
You can shoot video at 8K 24fps if you want to show off the power of the internals, or you can drop down to 4K60/30 for something a bit more manageable. I’d stick with the latter, as I find the stabilisation rather poor when shooting in 8K. 
Director’s View is a new software tweak for the camera. This allows you to shoot from multiple cameras at once, seeing a live preview for each one in real-time. It’s a very neat gimmick, and one I have used on several occasions already. 
Overall, the camera system might not make it the best camera phone around. But, it’s capable and reliable, with that trademark pop of colour you’d expect from a Samsung flagship.
Battery life

Expect to get around five to six hours of screen-on time
There is no charger in the box
Charging tops out at 25w, making it slower than its high-end competitors

With its 4000mAh battery, the Samsung Galaxy S21 isn’t a multi-day device and you shouldn’t expect the same mammoth endurance offered by the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. But with real world use I never struggled to make it through the day on a single charge.
Streaming an episode of Netflix over Wi-Fi in HDR with brightness set to 50% ate through 8% of its charge, while an hour of Spotify streaming with the display off took off another 3%. Over the five days I’ve been using the phone I have been averaging 5-6 hours of screen-on time, which also included leaving the phone unplugged overnight.
Super Fast charging (S21 pictured)
When it comes to charging, you’ll need to source your own plug. Yep, just like Apple, Samsung has slimmed the box right down and ditched all accessories aside from a USB-C cable and a SIM ejection tool.
I’m all for the environmental benefits of this move, but it would be nice if Samsung had offered a free charger to anyone who genuinely did need it. Thankfully, the S21 uses the now common USB-C port so chances are you’ve got a suitable replacement lying around from a phone, laptop, Nintendo Switch or iPad Air.
Don’t expect a charger in the box
The only slightly tricky part is that you’ll get varying speeds depending on what kind of plug you use. For instance, using the included power supply from an M1 MacBook Air, the phone took 94 minutes to go from 0-100%. When I switched to Samsung’s plug – a 25w unit from the Note 20 Ultra – it went from 0-100% in 70 minutes. It’s not a huge difference if you’re charging overnight, but it’s still worth noting if you want the fastest speeds possible. There’s 15w wireless charging too if you have a compatible Qi plug and far slower reverse charging for juicing up a smartwatch or earbuds.
You should buy if
1. You want a slim, light and pocketable device that doesn’t skimp on performance
While it’s not as technically advanced as previous S series phones, the S21 feels like a solid device that’ll suit most people’s needs. It’s slim, ever so light and importantly, doesn’t skimp on performance. The design is also just downright fun and the colour options are nicely varied and interesting. 
2. You want a reliable and versatile camera
They might not be huge jumps forward from the S20, but I have to say that I do like the pictures from the S21 and they’re especially great for social media sharing as they have a real colour punch. The ultra-wide is great and the new Director’s Views is a useful way to record video from multiple cameras at once.
3. You don’t want to spend nearly a grand
The Samsung Galaxy S21 is far more affordable than the S20 and while sacrifices have been made, it’s not a worse phone as a result. Plus, if you do want all those bells-and-whistles, there’s the Ultra model to jump at.
You should not buy if
1. You want a phone with a big screen
Even though the panel is of a high quality, 6.2-inches is a little small if you want a phone for lots of gaming and media binges. Thankfully there’s the 6.7-inch Plus model which has a far roomier display.
2. You want a camera with an amazing zoom
If you’re after a camera that can get really close to a subject without sacrificing detail, you might be better off with the S21 Ultra as that has a duo of dedicated zoom lenses.
3. You want a phone that’ll last multiple days
If you want a phone that’ll last two days between charges then you’re not going to get it here. The limit with the S21 is very much a day, unless you’re tending to the battery by using battery saver models and disabling features like the 120Hz refresh rate.

Verdict


































It’s big, powerful and very capable. If you’re after the very best Samsung Galaxy S21 model and money is no object, the Ultra is the one for you. It’s a big upgrade over the S20 Ultra, fixing the focus issues and improving battery life. It is very pricey though, especially when the regular S21 has become more affordable.



Pros
Great screen thanks to WQHD+ and 120HzMuch-improved design with an attractive finishFar more versatile camera than the iPhone 12 Pro Max

Cons
Expensive, with many cheaper phones offering the same featuresBig and heavyNo charger included

The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra phone stands as the most technologically advanced model in the new flagship line-up.
The Ultra was unveiled alongside the more modest Samsung Galaxy S21 and Galaxy S21 Plus and is the highest-specced model available. As such, if you plan to pick up the device, then you’ll need a fairly bulging wallet. 
With up to 16GB RAM, 512GB of storage, a 120Hz WQHD+ display and a 108-megapixel camera, this is Samsung’s no-compromise attempt at delivering the best Android phone ever. 
However, considering the regular S21 is far cheaper and gets the job done, do you really need to spend £1149/€1249/$1199 on a phone anymore? Here’s what we found after thoroughly testing the handset.
Price and release date
The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra was made available for pre-order on 14 January, immediately after its launch. It will hit retail stores on January 29.
The Galaxy S21 Ultra is designed to be a true “flagship” phone and, as such, this is reflected in its price. The starting RRP of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is £1149/€1249/$1199, which is marginally less than the Note 20 Ultra 256GB model and more than the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
The Galaxy S21 Ultra is also available through UK and US network vendors, if you don’t wish to buy the handset outright and prefer to pay in instalments.
Of course, with all non-essential shops currently closed in the UK, you’ll only be able to get these phones online right now.
Design and screen

The new design is a huge improvement, and for such a sizeable phone I found it feels comfortable to hold, more so than the iPhone 12 Pro Max
You can finally enable Adaptive Smoothness (aka 120Hz mode) and the highest WQHD+ resolution at the same time
It’s one of the largest, and heaviest, phones around

Taking the phone out of the box, it’s immediately obvious that two notable areas Samsung has made improvements – compared to the older S20 Ultra – relate to the S21’s screen and design. While neither were particularly poor, the bevvy of big and small changes add up to make this year’s device the one Samsung really should have launched last year when it first introduced the ‘Ultra’ branding.
In my opinion, the screen is the real star of the show. If you value a quality display over every other feature, then the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra makes a wonderful first impression.
It’s big at 6.8 inches, ever-so-slightly curved at the edges and, according to Samsung, can peak at a whopping 1500 nits of brightness. Sadly due to lockdown restrictions I didn’t have a colorometer to hand to check this figure, but with real world use it performed exceptionally well. Fire up some HDR video through Netflix – I used the neon-lit Altered Carbon as a test – and you’ll really see that brightness come into its own. It’s likely to be small in comparison to the displays of other tech you may have around the home, but there’s every likelihood that the S21 Ultra’s screen will be the finest.
The screen is great
In more practical scenarios, this level of brightness removes the risk of any issues with outdoor visibility, even in very sunny conditions. I never struggled to read the screen, even when using it in direct sunlight.
In a move that shows the degree to which Samsung is positioning this handset as the ‘true’ S21 flagship, this is the only phone of the trio to ship with both an adaptive refresh rate that can move between 10Hz and 120Hz and maintain a 1440p WQHD resolution. The icing on the cake is that both of these features can finally be used together, something that wasn’t possible with any of Samsung’s 2020 phones.
While it can be difficult to demonstrate how much of a difference faster refresh rates make without actually having the phone in your hands, it’s certainly something you’ll miss when it isn’t available. Everything feels so much faster, so much smoother and a great deal more responsive. The effect is even more welcome as an increasing number of games take advantage, offering higher frame rate options.
You can alter the motion smoothing settings
The adaptive nature of the refresh rate offers an interesting benefit by way of improved battery life. The idea is similar to the workings of ProMotion on Apple’s iPad Pro, rattling up and down the display speed to ensure that energy isn’t being wasted if there’s no visible benefit. 
For instance, there’s no point running at 120Hz when you’re simply watching a 30fps YouTube video or 24fps film on Netflix. The adaptive refresh rate tackles this issue, saving battery life in the process.
There’s a very welcome ‘Eye comfort shield’ option that tones down some bright and white colours, giving the screen more of an orange look. Obviously, this should be disabled when you want accurate colours; however, in the evenings and early morning I’ve noticed it makes the screen a lot easier on the eyes.
I also found the S21 Ultra’s in-display fingerprint scanner is a step up on the S20-family’s. It’s significantly faster and more reliable than the previous Samsung phones I’ve tested. Out of 50 unlock attempts, the S21 Ultra only ignored my thumb press on five occasions; this figure was around 15 on the Note 20 Ultra.

During a time when the benefits of even excellent face-unlock systems are stunted by mask-wearing, having a fast physical sensor is more welcome than in previous years.
My only issues with the screen are relatively minor. I’d still prefer it to be completely flat, rather than curved, since those edges result in some annoying reflections and contribute to accidental presses. The default ‘Vivid’ mode is also a little too saturated for my taste, especially when displaying bright colours; the ‘Natural’ option is a little more… well, natural, and gives colours a balanced realistic look. This is the setting I’d recommend most people use.
I’d also completely ignore the video enhancement option, since it makes videos too bright and often uncomfortable to watch. Aside from those issues, this is the best screen on any phone right now.
I’d certainly say that the Galaxy S21 Ultra is up there with the best when it comes to design too, although you really need to appreciate big phones to enjoy using this beast. It weighs 228g, which is the same weight as the iPhone 12 Pro Max – and it will only get heftier upon adding a case.

Compared to Apple’s most sizeable handset, however, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the nicer phone to hold. It’s slightly narrower, and the rounded sides make it far comfier in the hand than the harsh edges of the 12 Pro Max I tested last year. 
The most obvious shift is the new camera module, which is now closer to being part of the overall design of the phone, rather than just looking like it’s been stuck on the back at the last minute. 
The large module blends into the metal rails and is striking as a result. Combined with the new matte finish, available in either black or silver, and you have a phone that looks futuristic without feeling gaudy.
The buttons around the sides are clicky and responsive, if a little on the thin side, and the requisite IP68 rating for protection against accidental drops in water is present too. Those looking for a reintroduction of the 3.5mm headphone jack will be disappointed, plus there’s no microSD in the SIM tray now either.
Phantom Black is very striking
Camera

The dual zoom lenses seriously improve the camera’s ability to capture far away objects
While it’s not the fastest camera to shoot with, the focussing issues from the S20 Ultra are gone
You’ll get a lovely depth of field if you shoot at full 108MP

The camera system on the Galaxy S21 Ultra seems quite intimidating at first, but there’s every chance it could one of the best camera phones by the end of year. There are huge numbers floating about, four distinct lenses and a whole host of software features hyped up by Samsung. See the table below for a breakdown of the specs:

Instead of following Apple and Google’s lead, where much of the camera work is done computationally in the background, Samsung is hoping the use of high-end glass in the camera lenses will give it a lead in image quality. 
For the most part, I have been impressed by the phone’s camera skills. Testing in various shooting conditions I found it’s one of the most versatile mobile phone cameras around. No other phone, not even the iPhone 12 Pro Max, gives you so much variety in how you can shoot. The zoom skills are excellent and a seriously notable improvement over the Galaxy S20, and being able to shoot video from multiple cameras at once is a neat trick that I have found myself using on a few occasions.
The main camera is a new and upgraded 108MP f/1.8 sensor, which combines multiple pixels together to shoot 12MP snaps. You can easily switch to full 108MP pictures, if you’re willing to lose some of the camera’s zoom skills and sacrifice more of the phone’s storage (about 30MB per shot during testing). This is a pain, but if you do it I found the 108MP option is where the camera shines brightest.
When shooting at 108MP you get a lovely and completely natural, blurred background (aka bokeh) that is missing from the 12MP images.
108MP (downscaled to upload): You don’t get that blurry background in 12MP mode
There’s extra detail too, and this is especially noticeable if you’re capturing photos of animals. We’ve just got a new puppy, and with little else to take pictures of due to being stuck at home, I have mainly been testing this camera chasing Peach around the flat. Get her still and the pictures are great, though shooting at high-resolution does slow things down and it’s far from ideal if you’re trying to capture something that’s moving.
There’s a portrait mode for a stronger blur
Samsung has toned down how the camera captures colours a bit here, especially when you’re taking selfies with the 40MP front camera. You even get a pop-up asking you whether you’d like a more natural image when you first flip to the front camera. 
With that being said, there’s still a typically ‘Samsung’ look to photos. Reds are bright, greens are on the verge of being lurid, low-light pictures are on the yellow side and everything looks great on Instagram. There’s a little more sharpness to the photos too, especially when compared to photos taken on the latest iPhones.
Low-light performance is good, even without the night mode
 
Me trying to create an ‘At Home’ bar setting
Outside of this, the ultra wide sensor hasn’t seen a huge raft of upgrades, but it’s still one of the best around and ideal for shooting landscapes and getting more quirky results. Then there’s the duo of zoom cameras which can, in theory, take you 100x closer to the subject. 
Zoom at 30x

I wouldn’t bother going that far, but you’ll get great results if you stick to using up to 10x zoom and often get passable results at 30x if the lighting is good. There’s a nifty anti-shake software tweak too that adds a hit of much needed extra stabilisation. I found you still need to use a tripod if you want the best results though.
Another big focus for the S21 Ultra is video. You can shoot at 8K 24fps if you really want to show off the power of the internals (and you have somewhere to view that high-res footage) or you can drop down to 4K60/30 for something a bit more manageable. This also allows you to shoot from multiple cameras at once, seeing a live preview for each one in real-time. 
8K support is clearly here for the ‘wow factor’ and to tie in with Samsung’s dominance of the 8K TV market, but I’d advise just shooting in 4K as the results are so much better. Results are good; a quick run around the park showed off strong stabilisation and the mics do a decent job at cancelling out wind noise if you’re speaking directly at the phone. I still prefer the footage from an iPhone 12 as it feels more realistic and smoother, but as with all video, which is better will largely be down to personal taste. 
Where Samsung loses some of its shine is the software. Shooting at full 108MP still leads to a noticeable slowdown. On top of that, I couldn’t find an easy way for the camera to automatically jump into the brightness-increasing low-light Night Mode. Instead I had to manually flip to the option. I also found the brand’s AI scene optimiser doesn’t cope well with landscapes (everything is too green), even though it does add an extra sparkle to food shots. 
Performance

You’ll still either love or hate Samsung’s custom UI
There’s no microSD, however storage options go up to 512GB and RAM maxes out at 16GB, so storage won’t be an issue if you opt for the top specced version
You’ll find wide 5G support, good stereo speakers and strong call quality

As has become common for Samsung phones, the region where you buy the Galaxy S21 Ultra will determine the chipset used inside. US buyers will get a model with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, while we in the UK are treated to the Exynos 2100.

In the past we’ve found Exynos versions aren’t quite as good as their Snapdragon siblings. But during benchmarking I found that a lot of my past issues with Exynos chips have been fixed.
Of course, I can’t pass any judgement on the Snapdragon 888 model so all my thoughts on performance and battery come from the Exynos 2100 model with 12GB RAM, which proved suitably fast and power efficient during testing.
As with any flagship Android phone with a 120Hz display, you might feel that a lot of benefits of this are wasted. It won’t feel dramatically faster unless you’re upgrading from a phone that’s three/four years old and these days even mid-range chips have enough grunt to push Android games to their limits.
But that’s not to say the advancement of tech under-the-hood is pointless. Many of the benefits of these new chips are in areas like AI, giving you faster photo enhancements for instance. It also enables other clever camera tricks, like being able to view live video from all the cameras at once and recording 4K60 footage from different sensors simultaneously.
Both chipsets powering the S21 series have built-in 5G modems and the S21 Ultra supports multiple bands. I still haven’t got 5G service where I live and considering we’re all working from home due to current circumstances, I haven’t been able to test the service on this device. But I will when the lockdown lifts.
Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Ultra
The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the first main flagship device from the brand to ditch expandable microSD support in a number of years, meaning you need to choose wisely when you buy the phone. This feels like more of an issue on the S21 and S21 Plus, as they don’t offer the 512GB option you can get with the Ultra. 
For most this won’t be an issue as even the base 128GB is enough, though I would suggest spending a bit more for a 256GB option. If you plan to capture a lot of 108MP snaps (roughly 30MB each) and 8K video (around 1GB for two minutes) then you’ll likely see space fill up quickly.

For the first time, Samsung has brought S Pen compatibility to the mainline S series line. As an added bonus for past Samsung phone owners, S Pens from older Note phones will also work with the S21 Ultra. The downside is that, unlike with the Note though, the stylus here is an added extra (£32/$39) and it doesn’t slide into the phone itself. Instead, Samsung is selling some rather chunky cases that’ll keep the pen safe.
After a few days of use, I didn’t notice any real difference in how the pen worked and it offered near identical performance to what I experienced testing the Note 20 Ultra. It’s just as responsive to draw with and it remains handy to have. As there’s no way to charge the S Pen on the S21 Ultra, some of the features that require Bluetooth are gone however. But truthfully, I can’t say I have used these Air Gestures outside of reviewing a Note so the loss feels minimal.

There’s no denying Samsung’s software has improved dramatically in recent years and there are some genuinely excellent additions here that Samsung should probably shout louder about. DeX is great for outputting (even wirelessly) your phone onto a monitor and you’ve now got the Google Discover panel rather than one of Bixby’s useless homepages. Yet, a lot of the software remains frustratingly different from Google’s interpretation of Android and seems to have been designed simply for the sake of it.
On Android 11, I love having quick access to G Pay and my Home controls by simply pressing the lock key. On the S21 Ultra, you have to go into the notification panel, hit ‘Devices’ and access the shortcut from there. Why ruin a very handy feature for no clear reason?
It’s a similarly annoying story if you’re trying to connect accessories. There are multiple apps and drivers required for something as basic as pairing a smartwatch and many things require a Samsung account. Bloatware is a big issue too, with Samsung pre-installing apps from Microsoft, Google and itself – many of which offer the same functionality. There are also some minor bugs in the software, causing random bouts of slow-down. Hopefully, these will be ironed out in future updates. 
Battery life

Expect to get up to and around eight hours of screen-on time
There is no charger in the box
Charging tops out at 25w, below much of the high-end competition

Samsung has packed the S21 Ultra with a giant battery and during my week of testing it has offered impressive performance, typically offering seven to eight hours of screen-on time per charge. 
That means even if you’re a heavy user it should get you through even the busiest of days – this is with the default 1080p resolution and adaptive refresh rate enabled. Up things to 1440p and you get roughly an hour less. 
Of course, I feel the need to preface this with the usual note that I am currently spending a lot more time inside, not commuting and using Wi-Fi pretty much all the time. These are much safer conditions for a phone to be used that typically give you better endurance. So, once things are back to normal it’ll be interesting to see if my results change.
During my synthetic tests the S21 Ultra again offered good stamina. An hour streaming Spotify to a pair of Bluetooth headphones (screen off) took off 4%, while an hour of HDR Netflix ate through 7%. You can get more if you lower the brightness, but the result is dimmed somewhat.
Super Fast charging (S21 pictured)
When it comes to charging, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is less advanced. The max 25w wired charger and 15w wireless are a lot slower than much of the Android competition and it’ll take around 1 hr 40 to go from 0-100% with a typical laptop and a bit less if you’re using one of Samsung’s own Fast Chargers. 
Having gotten used to plugging something like the OnePlus 8T in while I shower in the morning and having it nearly hit 100% by the time I’m dressed, this is a shame – though likely better for battery health in the long term.
You’ll also need to provide the charging plug yourself and a pair of headphones as neither make an appearance inside the box. 
Expect to see this practice a lot this year and as USB-C is so widely used now across some of the best cameras, best laptops, tablets and even game consoles, it’s not so much of an issue. If you don’t have a plug to use with the included cable, Samsung has lowered the prices of its own and there are loads of suitable options on Amazon from brands like Anker and Aukey. 
You should buy if


You want the very top-spec Samsung phone going


The Galaxy S21 Ultra is an expensive phone and it’s at this price because it’s packed with top-drawer components – fast performance, large amounts of RAM and storage, high-quality display and lots of camera sensors.
Samsung took out some features from the S21 and S21 Plus, so if you want things like a WQHD+ display, more than 8GB RAM and lots of storage then you’re going to have to choose the Ultra.


The display quality is vitally important


The display is the star here. It’s big (6.8-inches), only slightly curved and packing both a WQHD+ resolution and adaptive refresh rate. It’s also ridiculously bright and will likely be the best screen you’ve got to watch HDR content on.


You’re happy with a big, heavy phone


There’s no getting away from it – this is a big phone. It’s definitely a two-handed device and at 228g it’s heavy, even more so if you add a case. Of course, big phones come with plenty of upsides, like the bigger display and larger, longer-lasting battery.
You should not buy if

 Having high-end specs isn’t that important

If you’re not worried about having the most RAM, swathes of storage and fancy extras like 8K video recording then you might end up paying more for stuff you don’t really need here. The S21 is still a great phone and it’s far cheaper. 

 Pocketability is key

While it’s a plus for some, the large size will definitely put many off. Make sure you’re comfortable with such a large device before investing.

 You want very fast charging

25w charging isn’t slow, but compared to phones from OnePlus and Huawei that can fully charge in around 40 minutes, the Ultra feels like it’s lagging behind.

Xiaomi’s Poco smartphone sub-brand has made a real impact with its ability to offer eyebrow-raising performance at a low price. The Poco X3 NFC continues that good work.
Earlier in 2020, the Poco F2 Pro gave off distinct early-OnePlus vibes with its mixture of flagship performance and a sub-£500 price tag. It made a number of very good Android phones look somewhat overpriced.
At just £199, the Poco X3 NFC looks to do the same for the budget brigade. Should Motorola be nervous?
Poco X3 NFC design and screen – It isn’t exactly eye-catching
While the Poco X3 NFC has a number of fine qualities, refined design isn’t one of them. It’s well built, but slightly bland to look at.
You certainly know when you’re carrying it, with a significant weight of 215g and a 9.4mm-thick chassis liable to make any pocket droop.
Nor is there an eye-catching finish to the phone’s plastic rear, of the type you get with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 or the Oppo Reno4 Z. Instead, there’s a fairly ugly band of diagonal lines into which a huge Poco logo is etched out.
Typically, I don’t give bundled-in cases more than a cursory glance, but you might want to consider using the clear silicon example that comes with the Poco X3 NFC. The phone sports a hugely prominent camera module, which the case mitigates with a large circular lip. Subtle it isn’t, but it should prove effective at warding off those inevitable dings.

Utilitarian design aside, the Poco X3 NFC has some stand-out features for its price. It isn’t too unusual to see a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and this one isn’t the speediest you’ll encounter. But how many phones these days have an IR blaster? This phone does, allowing you to use it to control your TV and hi-fi.
Indeed, those concerned with audio are particularly well served here, with both a 3.5mm headphone jack and stereo speakers included. The former isn’t particularly unusual in a £200 phone, but the latter most certainly is. Gamers on a budget take note.
They might also want to consider the Poco X3 NFC’s screen. It’s a large 6.67-inch IPS LCD that gets reasonably bright (450 nits) and sharp (1080 x 2400 or FHD). But the real stand-out spec here is a 120Hz refresh rate.
Now, the Poco isn’t alone in offering such a spec for an affordable price. The aforementioned Oppo Reno4 Z packs one, as does the Realme 7 5G. But both of those phones are a little more expensive than the Poco X3 NFC, and it still isn’t a normal thing to see so far south of £500.
There’s a 120Hz display
I still find that the impact of a silky-smooth 120Hz display is somewhat dulled when it’s framed and driven by more modest hardware. The extra punch of OLED will always be missed, and the limitations of the phone’s silicon will still result in slight pauses when carrying out tasks such as web browsing.
But let’s not be too churlish here. Having such a rapid display available for just £199 is a reason to celebrate, and it makes navigating through the phone’s homescreens and menus feel quite luxurious.
Poco X3 NFC performance – Maximum bangs for your bucks
We’ve already hinted that the Poco X3 NFC might be well suited to gamers on a budget, and that’s a point driven home by the handset’s excellent performance.
Xiaomi has managed to include a Snapdragon 732G CPU here, which is considerably more capable than the silicon employed by rival devices. The Redmi Note 9 (from another Xiaomi sub-brand) uses the insipid MediaTek Helio G85 CPU, while the Motorola G8 runs on the lesser Snapdragon 665.
An average Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 1769 trounces both by around 400-500. This translates into smooth performance when zipping around the Poco’s menus.
PUBG defaults to HFR and HD graphics
But back to those games – the Snapdragon 732G also packs a much meatier GPU than the Snapdragon 865, and that results in an all-round competent gaming experience that you don’t always get for this sort of money.
PUBG Mobile defaults to High Frame Rate and HD graphics, which is impressive for a phone at this end of the market. And it follows through on those settings with a smooth, sharp Battle Royale experience.
Poco X3 NFC camera – Comfortably competent snaps
The Poco X3 NFC nominally packs four cameras onto the back of the phone, although as is often the case with affordable phones, there are only really two of note.

A main 64-megapixel sensor is supported by a 13-megapixel ultra-wide, and these are supported by a 2-megapixel depth sensor and a 2-megapixel macro.
There’s really not all that much to say about the latter two, other than the fact that they’re fairly inconsequential. However, the main two sensors are quite a bit sharper than you normally get for the money.
In practice, you get nicely balanced images in good lighting from that main sensor. Ultra-wide shots show a marked drop in vibrancy and sharpness by comparison, but are more usable than those taken on many cheaper phones.
I captured a number of shots across a couple of bright winter mornings, and early evenings just before sunset, and was pleased at how the Poco handled the distinctive ambience created by the low, weak sun.

Ultra wide
It did struggle a little with overexposing certain background elements, as is normal at this end of the market. In general, though, the results were decent.
Even 2X shots look okay here, despite the lack of a dedicated telephoto. You can thank that 64-megapixel main sensor for that, which allows the X3 NFC to crop in without too much loss in detail.
You could really pick these images apart if you zoomed right in, but we’d suggest that if you’re prepared to do so, you should perhaps be shopping a little higher in the market. The overall impression is a positive one, and the Poco X3 NFC will handle your social media posts and incidental snaps comfortably.
2x zoom
A Night mode is included, too, although without OIS these shots are rather crudely brightened affairs – and they take several seconds to process. Again, for the money, it’s a pretty effective tool, but don’t expect low-light miracles.
Low-light
Poco X3 NFC software – MIUI is much improved
Xiaomi’s MIUI 12 runs on the Poco X3 NFC, and while it isn’t my favourite custom Android 10 skin, it’s perfectly pleasant to use day to day.
It isn’t free from bloatware, with an assortment of Xiaomi apps clogging up the homescreen. We could take or leave (preferably leave) the likes of Gallery, File Manager, Themes, Cleaner, Music, Mi Video, Weather, Notes, and Xiaomi’s own Mi Browser. The latter, of course, is completely superfluous with Google Chrome also preinstalled.
Talking of the big G, its apps are sequestered away inside a separate folder. You also get a folder with half a dozen or so third-party apps, ranging from the obvious (Facebook and Netflix) to the somewhat niche (WPS Office and LinkedIn).
MIUI’s Tools folder gives you a bunch of limited but useful single-purpose apps, such as Calculator and Clock. And in keeping with the Poco X3 NFC’s gaming capabilities, there’s a Game Turbo app that augments your gaming experience with various optimisations and do-not-disturb features.
MIUI is much improved
One aspect of this UI I really didn’t like was its habit of taking you to a separate screen – complete with an ad – every time an app completes its installation. It’s highly annoying, especially when you’re in the middle of something.
Say what you will about MIUI’s slightly artless look, but it’s thoroughly customisable. You can resize and rejig the icons, adjust the layout, choose from lots of custom themes, and more. Credit to Xiaomi for not adding an ugly custom widget screen to the left of the home screen, too. It’s Google Feed all the way, just how I like it.
MIUI is also nice and fluid, except on the odd occasion where the hardware can’t quite keep up with that 120Hz display. It’s nothing drastic, and likely nothing that the software would be able to help much with, but you can tell you’re not dealing with a true flagship here.
Poco X3 NFC battery life – Ample stamina and super-fast charging
A 5160mAh battery sees the Poco X3 NFC coping well with the day-to-day grind. If you largely restrict your use to mundane tasks such as messaging, calling, and the odd bout of web browsing, or if you drop the screen refresh rate to 60Hz, you could quite easily get two full days out of it.
Flip the switch on the 120Hz and hit the media, however, and you’ll see that battery meter drop a little quicker. An hour of Netflix, with the screen brightness set to max, drained 11-13% in my tests.
This isn’t brilliant compared to most phones at this end of the market. The Vivo Y70 – as bog standard a phone you’re likely to find – loses just 8% under similar conditions. Of course, that phone can only get you a 60Hz display refresh rate.
A better comparison would be the Realme 7 5G, which has a similar combination of low-end processor, 5000mAh battery and 120Hz display; it also loses around 11% in this test. The Oppo Reno4 Z, which pairs a 120Hz display with a much smaller 4000mAh battery, loses a whopping 15-16%. So the Poco isn’t doing all that badly within this subsection of affordable 120Hz phones.
Charging is pretty rapid, too, courtesy of a bundled 33W charger. I was able to get the Poco X3 NFC from 28% to 88% – an increase of 60% – in just 30 minutes. That’s way faster than rival efforts such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9, which tend to top out at 18W.
Should you buy the Poco X3 NFC?
If there’s a sub-£200 phone that offers as potent a package as the Poco X3 NFC, we’ve yet to see it.
The handset pairs better-than-usual performance with a slick 120Hz display, stereo sound and strong battery performance. Fast charging, a competent camera, and reasonably clean software (barring a few niggles) round out a remarkably complete package.
If you’re a gamer looking for a cheap phone, or if you want to extract every last ounce of performance and features for your £200, the Poco X3 NFC is the one.

Verdict




























 



Motorola has shown remarkable focus in creating a phone with the potential to go on for days on a single charge. The sacrifices made to achieve this goal in terms of form factor and display quality, however, should probably prompt most people to look elsewhere.




Pros

Phenomenal battery life
Decent camera in good lighting
Clean software



Cons

Mediocre 720p screen
Hefty, ugly design
Unremarkable performance

The Moto G9 Power, like all of Motorola’s previous Power phones, is named for a single outstanding attribute. And it’s got nothing to do with performance.
These phones have all had oodles of battery power on tap, and the Moto G9 Power is no different. In fact, it’s got more power in reserve than any Motorola phone before it.
Panning out a little, the cheap phone field has grown a lot more competitive in the past year or two, with a bunch of exciting new contenders challenging Motorola’s sub-£200 supremacy. Does the Moto G9 Power have enough stamina for this fight?
Design and screen – The Moto G9 Power is grippy but not too sharp
Motorola has mercifully ditched the glossy fingerprint-magnet design of the Moto G8 Power. Indeed, the Moto G9 Power might be even less concerned with turning heads than its predecessor.
This is a deeply practical phone design, with an overtly grippy, textured finish to its all-plastic body and a solid rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. It’s just as chunky as the G8 Power at 9.7mm thick, and a lot heavier at 221g (as compared to 197g).
There are two very good reasons for this extra size: a huge screen and a massive battery. But you should know that the Moto G9 Power is never more conspicuous than when it’s sat in your pocket – or as is more likely, when it’s sticking out slightly.

There’s no IP rating here, but Motorola does speak of a “water-repellent design” to give you some rain protection.
I’d back this robust-feeling phone to stand up to knocks and bumps quite well too, but its huge 6.8-inch screen (which is almost half an inch bigger than the Moto G8 Power) is as vulnerable as they come. I picked up an alarmingly large scratch right across the middle of the screen very early on in my time with the phone.
While I didn’t wrap it up in the bundled silicon case or add a screen protector, I’m one of those meticulous sorts who doesn’t ever let their phone share pocket space with hard objects, so the cause is a bit of a mystery. I suspect this is merely a matter of bad luck rather than an inherent screen weakness, but I thought I’d mention it nonetheless – if only to point out that Power and Force are not the same thing.
Far more of a concern is the quality of that huge screen. This is a 60Hz IPS LCD with muted colours and grey blacks, which isn’t a problem at this price point. But rolling back the resolution to a mere 720 x 1640 (HD+) after the FHD+ G8 Power most certainly is.

Giving you a much bigger yet much less defined canvass, resulting in a paltry 263ppi output, seems like an odd decision from Motorola. I get that the Moto G9 Power is all about prioritising battery life, but the cost to clarity is too much.
Full HD really isn’t too much to ask for in the sub-£200 category either. While the aforementioned Moto G8 Power cost £220 at launch, the Moto G8 Plus is still being sold for exactly the same price as the Moto G9 Power, and that has a Full HD display. Meanwhile, the Poco X3 NFC gives you FHD in addition to a 120Hz refresh rate for dead on £200.
Performance – The Moto G9 Power is fast enough for the price
The Moto G9 Power runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 662 CPU, which is a very similar chip to the Snapdragon 665 packed into the Moto G8 Power. The Snapdragon 665 is technically the superior of the two, though the 662 is much newer, and both have their relative strengths and weaknesses.
We’re looking at rough parity between the two generations, with an average Geekbench 5 score of 309 single-core and 1379 multi-core. The Moto G8 Power scored 312 and 1361 respectively.
Like its predecessor, the Moto G9 Power packs 4GB of RAM. That’s just about the minimum spec for running Android well these days, so we can’t really have any complaints for the price.
All of this, together with that fuzzy display and a single speaker, means that the Moto G9 Power really isn’t well suited to gaming. It’ll run PUBG no higher than Balanced/Medium frame rate, which is just one notch off the lowest rung. It doesn’t look good.
Again, it’s worth pointing out what the Poco X3 NFC offers for £20 more. The phone’s Snapdragon 732G CPU is much better suited to gaming, and you also get the benefits of stereo speakers and a 1080p 120Hz display.
The G9 Power lays on 128GB of internal storage, which is a strong provision, if hardly unique for the money. You can expand that amount via a microSD slot too.

Camera – How good is the Moto G9 Power’s camera?
Motorola has ostensibly equipped the Moto G9 Power with a triple camera, but it isn’t really. The only genuine camera here is a 64MP wide sensor, with no telephoto or ultrawide lenses to back it up as there was in the Moto G8 Power.
Supplemental sensors are often terrible in cheap phones, but last year’s effort did a decent job in providing a flexible budget shooting experience. What’s more, Motorola has fitted the G9 Power out with a way less useful 2MP Macro Vision camera instead.
Once again you get a 2MP depth sensor for aiding with those blurry-background portrait shots. It’s fine at what it does, but it hardly earns its billing as a separate camera.
The main focus is that 64MP main snapper, and the good news is it’s pretty good for the price. It turns out 16MP shots via a pixel binning technique, which uses the spare pixels to improve clarity.
While the shooting experience can feel a little sluggish, the results are largely crisp and well balanced. Auto HDR does a good job at reining in extremes of light and shade without looking weird, even if it can rob certain scenes of depth and drama. Here is a few samples.
HDR on
HDR off
I did manage to catch the autofocus napping on the odd occasion with a quick snapshot, which I only realised when I checked back on my computer – another mark against that 720p display. But generally speaking, the Moto G9 Power camera holds its own in good light.
It also has a Night Vision mode. Check out the two shots of the dark passageway with Night Vision turned on and off. Night Vision draws out the detail in the cellar ceiling and balances out the light sources much better, even if it does all still look a little fuzzy.
Night Vision on
Night Vision on
Night Vision off
In true night time conditions, however, Night Vision isn’t much cop. Sure, it brightens things up significantly, but everything looks blurry and indistinct, like the phone is unable to compensate for natural hand movements. Which, given that there’s no OIS, is probably the case. Even when you do manage to keep your hands nice and still, a huge amount of noise invades night time scenes.
There’s also a 16MP selfie camera, as before, which turns out pretty sharp results as these things go.

One area in which the Moto G9 Power’s camera is notably inferior to the Moto G8 Power’s is with video capture. Thanks to the use of the Snapdragon 662, it can only manage 1080p/30fps video capture, whereas its predecessor could hit 4K/30fps and 1080p/60fps.
Software – Typically clean Android experience from Motorola
Android 10 comes as standard on the Moto G9 Power, and while phones are moving onto Android 11 by now, that’s not unusual in the budget sphere.
This is a Motorola phone, so you’re looking at as light a custom skin as you’ll find in all of Android. If you like your Google software stock, this is as good as it comes outside of the Pixel 4a or an Android One device.
Motorola makes sparing, judicious tweaks here and there, many of which are accumulated in the classy Moto app. Here you can learn about Moto Gesture, which lets you do things like activate the torch with two chop motions, or twist twice to open the camera app.

Add custom styles and wallpapers function, and that’s pretty much your lot. Everything else is distinctly Googley, with all the main G-apps handling core functions like image gallery, web browser, calls and messaging.
I’d take Motorola’s light approach to software over the heavy custom UIs of its rivals (including the Poco X3 NFC) any day of the week.
Battery Life – The Moto G9 Power has truly epic stamina
All of the Moto G9 Power’s quirks and foibles exist to facilitate one thing: a flipping huge battery.
At 6000 mAh, this is Motorola’s biggest battery ever, and certainly the biggest I’ve ever seen in a phone. The Moto G8 Power, by contrast, weighed in with a relatively wimpy 5000 mAh cell.
Motorola claims 60 hours of battery life, which to give some perspective is 50% more than the Moto G8 Plus by the company’s own reckoning. Having put the phone through its paces, I’m not remotely inclined to disagree.
A PC Mark battery benchmark score of 25hr 44min is around double that of rivals like the Poco X3 NFC. It’s not far off three times better than the likes of the Realme 7.
Such phones have smaller batteries, of course, but also smaller, higher resolution, and higher refresh rate displays. This right here is the pay off for having such an underwhelming screen in the G9 Power.
Sustained media playback levels the playing field somewhat. An hour of Netflix streaming with the screen brightness set to full sapped 7% of a full charge. That’s still good for a budget phone running on a humble processor, but it’s not spectacular.
To pluck a couple of other examples out of the aether, the Vivo Y70 with its 4100 mAh battery, FHD display and Snapdragon 665 lost 8% in this informal test. The Realme 5 with its 5000 mAh battery, HD display and Snapdragon 665 CPU lost 9%.
For those who value stamina way more than media experience, or who are routinely away from a power point for three days at a time, the Moto G9 is near the top of a relatively short list of options.
It comes bundled with Motorola’s 20W TurboPower 20 fast charger, which I found was able to get from 16% to 99% in two hours. 15 minutes will generally get you a 13% increase, right up until the final stretch when the charging rate invariably slows down.
That’s not massively fast, but do remember the sheer size of that battery. There’s a lot more battery to fill here, so the G9 Power’s recharging numbers look pretty good in context.

Should you buy the Moto G9 Power?
The Moto G9 Power is even more of a specialist tool than previous models in the range, for better and for worse.
On the positive side, its battery is bigger and lasts longer than ever before. If you have to have a phone that will last you through several days in between charges, and you only have £200 to spend on it, then the Moto G9 Power strains every sinew to make that possible.

These are the best Android phones
Care about photos? These are the best camera phones

However, this blinkered focus on extending stamina has left the Moto G9 Power bigger and heavier than before, and with modest performance and a poor screen that doesn’t do media content any favours whatsoever.
With accomplished rivals like the Poco X3 NFC supplying an all round superior experience for similar money, the Moto G9 Power finds itself the master of an extremely small niche.

Verdict





























 



The Galaxy Tab Active 3 is the very definition of a niche device, and one that lacks the performance and refinement for most people. For those who value robustness above all else, however, it’s a pretty tough tablet to beat.



Pros

As tough as it claims
Can be used with gloves on
S Pen function
Can be used without battery



Cons

Limited performance
Android tablet experience still limited
Feels pricey






Key Specifications

S Pen stylus
Replaceable 5050 mAh battery



We take it for granted that the iPad is the best tablet on the market. But really, it’s only the best for some of the people some of the time.
For delivery drivers, manual labourers, construction workers, and those undertaking the kind of home projects that would have your average Apple Store employee scurrying for the microfibre cloth, no iPad is up to the task.
The Samsung Tab Active 3 reckons it’s tough enough to take all the knocks and scrapes you can throw its way. The following review will try to figure out whether that’s true, and just as importantly, whether it can perform the even tougher task of being a decent tablet.
Design – Chunky and suitably utilitarian
Even without the hard-wearing shell case that ships with the Galaxy Tab Active 3, this is a tough, no-nonsense piece of kit. Its all-plastic build sports reinforced corners and a removable, flexible, hard-wearing rear panel.
That last point matters, because it means that you can remove and replace the Tab Active 3’s battery. The optional SIM and microSD cards fit into a pull-out try on the left edge, so you won’t have to rip the back off every time you need to access it – though you will have to remove the case. This represents an improvement over the Galaxy Tab Active 2.
At just shy of 430g without that case, it’s pretty hefty for an 8-inch tablet (the iPad Mini is 300g. It’s also pretty thick at almost 10mm.

The front of the tablet is notable for the provision of three physical hardware buttons just below the display. It feels rather like a relic from a bygone era, a sensation that’s only enhanced by a sizeable chin and forehead.
Remember, though, that this tablet has been designed for use in inhospitable conditions where bulky gloves may be worn. It makes perfect sense to have physical buttons over wishy-washy gestures, and you do at least get a solid fingerprint sensor under the central home button.
The sides of the Galaxy Tab Active 3 hold some interesting elements. To the right there’s an extra red button that can be assigned to open any application with a press or hold.
In a working environment, there’s often that one app that you need constant speedy access to. This button can get you to that app, even from the lock screen, and it doubles as a camera shortcut and shutter button.
The opposite edge holds a pogo pin connector, which will only really be useful for certain business use cases. But again, that’s what this hard-working tablet is meant for. On the bottom you get a 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB-C port, and a single speaker.

Ruggedness – Truly hard to beat
The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 is a pretty ordinary tablet with an extraordinary level of ruggedness. To that end, Samsung sent along a simple test kit to help put the tablet through its paces.
I buried the Galaxy Tab Active 3 in a couple of inches of sand and immersed it in a bucket of water for several minutes to help put its IP68 water and dust resistance rating to the test. It came through both trials relatively unscathed, though some lingering grit did seem to jam up the multitasking and back buttons for a brief while, before a combination of water and use worked it loose.
When it came to the water immersion, the Tab Active 3 worked perfectly both during the test (when I kept the PUBG lobby running) and immediately after, once I’d towelled it down.
It’s also possible to delve into the settings and increase the screen sensitivity, enabling you to use the tablet with gloves on. I tested this out with a set of heavy duty work gloves that Samsung provided, and it worked well, with the odd missed input. Together with those physical fascia controls, it’s genuinely viable to use the Tab Active 3 without removing your mitts – warehouse workers and campers rejoice.

Finally, the drop test saw me releasing the Galaxy Tab Active 3 (in its case, I should add) onto a hard concrete floor from a height of roughly 1.5 metres. Except for a slightly scuffed case, the tablet emerged unmarked and totally functional. Samsung’s claims of military grade MIL-STD–810H ruggedness seem to be accurate.
Screen and S Pen – Improved display with a clean writing experience
I’d hesitate to call the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 a truly compact tablet – it’s too tank-like for that – but it does pack a smaller-than-average 8-inch display. This places it in similar territory to the iPad mini.
This is a decent PLS TFT panel, which is Samsung’s IPS equivalent. At 1200 x 1920 it’s plenty sharp enough, and it gets pleasingly vibrant for an LCD. Outdoor visibility is good, as you’d expect, even if it does wash out a little in bright light. It’s a big step up from the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 2, at any rate.
Samsung also supplies its S Pen here. This plastic stylus doesn’t slot into the tablet itself, like with Samsung Galaxy Note 20 phones, but rather into a large and tight-fitting slot on top of the protective case.

The up side to this is that the S Pen here is much thicker and, well, pen-like than the skinny stick that comes with the Note 20 Ultra (for example). It’s much easier and more comfortable to use, especially with cold or gloved hands.
Otherwise the writing experience is very similar to the Note, with the same 4,096 levels of pressure allowing for convincing, natural handwriting and sketching. You also get that familiar button for bringing up the pen menu and quickly starting notes.
Specs and Performance – Outdated silicon achieves the bare minimum
The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 packs Samsung’s own Exyno 9810 CPU. This is an old flagship chip, which previously powered the Samsung Galaxy S9 from early 2018.
It should be clear that this is far from a star performer. Average Geekbench scores of 329 (single-core) and 1290 (multi-core) really aren’t too hot, and trail well behind even your average £300 smartphone.
Of course, the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 isn’t meant to be a multimedia powerhouse. Even so, I put it through its paces with PUBG, where it ran adequately on medium settings. The main thing is that general navigation is nice and smooth, though I did start to note major pauses when flicking back to older open apps in the app switcher menu – doubtless thanks to a mere 4GB of RAM.
Elsewhere you get 64GB of storage, which as mentioned can be augmented via a microSDXC slot.
There’s also a 13-megapixel f/1.9 camera here. That’s hardly a spectacular set-up by modern smartphone standards, but then no one is buying this for their holiday snaps (hopefully). It will do a good enough job with practical applications like scanning barcodes, documenting deliveries and the like.
Meanwhile, an 8-megapixel f/2.2 selfie camera should see you through those Zoom meetings just fine.
Software – Samsung’s usual box of tricks
The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 runs on Android 10 with One UI 2.5. You’ll probably have your own clearly defined feelings about Samsung’s custom Android skin by now.
It’s a love it or tolerate it effort, with big bright icons, lots of customisation potential, and the Samsung Daily news and notice board to the left of the home screen rather than Google Feed. It’s not as egregious with the bloat as it used to be, and it’s slick and fluid to navigate through.
You also get Samsung’s DeX UI, which lets you connect to compatible TVs and displays for a more PC-like experience, even using the tablet itself as a trackpad. I found that it worked reasonably well with my 2020 LG TV, despite the fact it technically isn’t supported.
From a more general perspective, the Android tablet experience continues to trail Apple’s iPad platform by a considerable distance, especially when it comes to third party app optimisation. Sadly, that’s something that Samsung can’t do much about.
The company’s S Pen software, however, has gotten really good, especially the wonderful Notes app that can read your handwriting and convert it to digital text. It’s got genuine productivity chops.

Battery Life – Large battery can be removed from the equation
Samsung has outfitted the Galaxy Tab Active 3 with a 5050 mAh battery, which is way bigger than its predecessor’s rather weedy 4450 mAh cell.
It’s good for a claimed 11 hours of video playback or internet time, and 81 hours of audio playback. You’ll comfortably get through a couple of days of the kind of mixed, functional usage that it’s been designed for. Though obviously, if you’re hammering the LTE connectivity and consuming a lot of video content, your experience may vary.
I’ve already mentioned that the Galaxy Tab Active 3 battery can be removed and replaced, which is rare enough these days. But the really interesting new feature is the ability to use the tablet without the battery even installed.
I discovered this by accident, having assumed that the battery was merely flat. Sure enough, I plugged in the tablet and it booted up fine sans cell, which felt somehow magical.
In terms of practical applications for this feature, I can well imagine hot-swapping batteries or keeping the Galaxy Tab Active 3 as a constantly running, permanently plugged in warehouse workhorse.
You also get a 15W charger, which isn’t exactly lightning quick, but it gets the job done. The Galaxy Tab Active 3 will detect when the port is wet and remind you to dry it before charging.
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3?
The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3 really is a specialist tool for a very specific set of scenarios. If you need a large-screen device that can stand up to the rough and tumble of a particularly physical job, it’s ideal.
For literally any other tablet use case scenario, you’re better off with one of Apple’s products. The latest iPad Air 4 costs just £40 more, and ruggedness aside, it’s vastly superior to the Tab 3 in every way. The value proposition here is highly questionable if robustness isn’t of paramount importance.

These are the best tablets you can buy

Unless you really need the precise super-tough credentials of the Tab, it would be tempting to suggest buying the iPad Mini and investing the extra £140 in an Apple Pencil and a ruggedised case.
But for those who need their tablet to stand up to the (quite literal) daily grind without worrying about a few scratches, it’s one of precious few options.

Verdict




























 



One of the most interesting phones of recent years, and a solid first effort at a new form factor. However, the LG Wing has made a few too many compromises, with too few corresponding advantages, and for too much money to be worth a gamble over the very best flagships.




Pros

Original flip-screen approach
Well built
Gimbal mode is an interesting way to shoot



Cons

Flip screen has limited use case scenarios
Performance isn’t amazing for the price
Very heavy phone

The LG Wing shows that you don’t have to go foldable if you want innovation from your next smartphone.
With a unique swing-out display that rotates to reveal a secondary screen, it’s fair to say that we haven’t quite seen anything like this before. And while $999 is hardly cheap (we still don’t know of a firm UK launch plan), it’s a fair bit less than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2.
As is often the case with such eccentric concepts, there are a number of compromises that rule out a straight recommendation. But you have to hand it to LG for having a crack at something new.
Design and screen – Hefty but clever dual-screen system
The LG Wing’s USP hinges, quite literally, on its rotating display. Place a little lateral pressure on the bottom right edge of the screen and the whole 6.8-inch panel will twist 90 degrees.
Coming to rest in a squat crucifix formation, it leaves you in the unusual position of holding the phone in portrait, but with a landscape-oriented screen. It also unveils a second, altogether squarer, portrait display.
The idea here is that you can indulge in true multitasking when you require it. We’ll get into how that fares in the software section, but from a design perspective, LG has engineered the hinge rather well. There’s a well-sprung feel to the motion that inspires confidence, not to mention plenty of fidget spinner-like fiddling.
Opening the display in this way has the unfortunate side effect of inhibiting access to the side-mounted power and volume keys, however. These controls aren’t sufficiently differentiated in terms of shape or texture either, so you can’t feel them out very easily.

Unfortunately, that hinge mechanism and secondary screen also add a whole lot of weight. At 260g, the LG Wing is chunky enough to barge its way past the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium (236g) and the Black Shark 3 Pro (253g) as the heaviest Android phones I’ve ever used. It’s not exactly slim either, at 10.9mm thick.
Still, LG appears to have used that extra weight to reinforced the Wing. It’s a sturdy piece of kit despite its moving components, with an impressive Mil-STD–810G Test certification.
I can confirm this toughness too, up to a point. In the process of trying to work the Wing free of its surprisingly tough wrapper, I somehow contrived to launch it horizontally into a toughened-glass heater. The Wing didn’t pick up so much as a scuff, even with a dual-curved glass back and display.
On the flip side, it’s only IP54 splash proof, with a water-repellent coating. So it won’t survive full immersion like similarly priced IP68-certified flagships.

While we’re on the design negatives, you only get a single bottom-mounted speaker here. Given the phone’s unique media-friendly attributes and premium pricing, not to mention LG’s history of strong audio, I really felt the lack of stereo sound.
The LG Wing’s main display is pretty nice to use in isolation, but it doesn’t stack up to other phones that can be had for around $999. It’s a 6.8-inch 20.5:9 POLED with a Full HD resolution. In terms of colour accuracy and brightness, it’s pretty much spot on.
But it misses out on the QHD resolution of the Samsung Galaxy S20 and the OnePlus 8 Pro, as well as the 120Hz refresh rate of both. Indeed, at just 60Hz, the LG Wing’s screen almost feels like it’s from a previous generation despite its forward-thinking attributes.
What you do get, unlike most other high-end phones, is a viewing experience uninterrupted by a notch. LG has included a pop-up selfie camera, much like the OnePlus 7T Pro. LG has also managed to work in an in-display fingerprint sensor, though it feels a little weird to use in its flipped state.
The other screen is a 3.9-inch G-OLED, with a 1080 x 1240 resolution. It’s the smallest phone screen I’ve seen since the ill-fated Palm Phone, and I wouldn’t want to do anything more demanding than messaging or light browsing on it. But it’s of a decent quality, and it more or less matches the main display for colour and brightness.
Performance – Adequate, but should be better
With the added complexity of that flip-out display, LG has evidently had to make a few compromises, lest it hit Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 levels of pricing madness. One of those compromises is performance.
You get the same Snapdragon 765G chip that’s become so popular among the best mid-range phones. It’s essentially punching at the same weight as the Pixel 5, the Oppo Find X2 Neo, and the Motorola Edge.
The trouble is that the LG Wing isn’t priced the same as those phones. It costs as much as phones that pack the far superior Snapdragon 865, and some of those phones also include 12GB of RAM rather than the 8GB provided here.
While the Snapdragon 765G gets justified praise for offering silky smooth performance in keenly priced phones, I’m less inclined to look upon its inclusion in the Wing so favourably. For this money, it feels like it should be faster.
That’s not to say that I could really make the phone sweat in general usage. Everything’s fast and fluid here, and you can run demanding games on high settings with only a slight drop off in performance.
But I did pick up on slight pauses and stutters when multitasking using the dual-screen function, and when jumping into apps using the app switcher on the second display.

They’re not massive pauses, and I’d never call the experience bad. But I’d argue that the LG Wing’s dual-screen nature could make even better use of the extra power and efficiency of the Snapdragon 865 than a ‘normal’ flagship, which makes its omission galling.
Camera – Generally decent, with a gimbal gimmick
The LG Wing’s triple-camera array holds its own against a whole bunch of almost-flagship phones, though it’s hardly ripping up trees.

You get a 64-megapixel f/1.8 main wide sensor with OIS, which is capable of taking clean, bright shots in most conditions. There’s a night mode that brightens darker shots up quite aggressively, though it’s not as competently executed as true flagships like the iPhone 12 or the Huawei Mate 40 Pro.
This main sensor is accompanied by a 13-megapixel ultrawide and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. No, that’s not a typo – you really do get two ultrawides here, which of course means you miss out on a telephoto. Any zoomed shots you take will be cropped.
One of those ultrawides is for use in standard orientation, while the other enables you to take shots in the phone’s gimbal mode. Essentially, when the screen is in the flipped position, you get controls on the secondary screen that let you pan and stabilise your videos and snaps.
It’s a neat feature, though we should point out that this all comes down to software cropping tricks. Without OIS, and with just a single fixed ultrawide sensor, there is no physical panning or steadying technology here.
Around the front of the phone you get a nice sharp 32-megapixel camera that pops up from the top of the phone. It’s yet another mechanical component, which does make us worry about the Wing’s longevity, but it seems solid.
See below for a selection of sample shots:
      
Software – Flipping weird
LG provides its usual reskinning of Android 10, but that’s really not the point of interest here. That would be the company’s implementation of its crazy dual-screen setup.
As first attempts go, it’s not bad, but nor does it feel like the finished product. Flipping the display around 90 degrees opens up a horizontal content carousel filled with a limited selection of apps on the main screen, and a simplified home screen on the bottom.
While this is evidently aimed at making the split-screen process intuitive, it’s far from ideal. Despite essentially gaining an extra 4-inches of screen space, a good chunk of your home screen content essentially gets sucked into oblivion.
You’re wholly unable to access any of the apps you might have installed from this view. Instead, if you want to use a third party app on the ‘top’ screen, you’ll have to open it in standard mode before initiating the flip.
That said, it’s not hard to see why LG might have wanted to discourage wider navigation in this mode. Most apps don’t feel too great with the screen offset in this way. Anything in landscape (such as games) requires you to hold the thinner, rotated section of the display, leaving the bulk of the phone’s body dangling awkwardly in between your hands.
Where LG’s approach really promises to pay off is with some very specific combinations of lighter tasks. Watching a YouTube video on the top screen whilst checking your email on the bottom, for example. Or checking the weather forecast through the widget whilst messaging your plans on the bottom.
As that suggests, the lower screen is really mainly useful for typing and communication tasks. That might be enough for some power users, but it feels a little undercooked at this point.

There’s no default ability to transfer content from one screen to the other either, so it doesn’t feel like a particularly cohesive experience – though playing video on the bottom screen will pause anything playing on the top.
Battery Life – Strong, provided you don’t overuse the split screen
I had no complaints whatsoever with the LG Wing’s stamina. While its 4000mAh battery is hardly the biggest around – especially when you consider the phone’s overall bulk – it’s more than up to the task of getting you through a day of solid usage.
After a long 15 hour day, during which I totted up 3 hours 40 minutes of screen on time, I was left with 53% in the tank. This opens up the possibility of genuine two day usage for light to moderate users.
Heavier usage and media consumption will obviously bring that figure down, but you shouldn’t have to worry about finding a power point before bed time. Using the LG Wing in the unique way it was intended to be, however, just might cause a few problems.
Watching 30 minutes of Netflix on the top screen whilst simultaneously surfing the web in Chrome on the bottom screen, with the brightness set to max, sapped 14% of a charge. We’d be disappointed if a phone lost that much with double the amount of video playback under ordinary circumstances.
It’s completely understandable, given the two tasks that are being undertaken simultaneously. But it’s also something worth bearing in mind if you plan to take full advantage of the Wing’s key feature.
Should you buy the LG Wing?
The LG Wing is a true one of a kind – a dual-screen smartphone that doesn’t rely on foldable or traditional hinged technology.
As a result, those looking for true multitasking potential in a more traditional form factor – and for a less extortionate price – could well find something of interest here. The hinge is solid and works more or less as advertised, and the phone is generally quite pleasant to use.
However, there are noteworthy compromises here, chiefly in terms of weight and performance. For the money, you can get a much more capable best phone, while LG hasn’t quite exploited the system’s dual-screen potential to its fullest potential.

Verdict





























 



For most people, the Samsung Galaxy S20 is still one of the best Android phone available right now. Especially with the cheaper prices around.

However, I would seriously consider the Galaxy S20 FE which has a Snapdragon 865 and better battery life, along with superior performance. There's also the OnePlus 8T which has a similarly ace display and the Pixel 5 if you're looking for something even smaller.



Pros

Lovely screen
A perfect size
Huge camera improvements over the S10



Cons

The fingerprint scanner is poor
120Hz refresh rate drains battery
It looks just like every other Samsung phone






Key Specifications

Review Price: £799
CPU: Snapdragon 865/Exynos 990
Memory: 8/12GB RAM
Battery capacity: 4000mAh
Interface: OneUI 2.0
Audio: no headphone jack
5G? Yes - 4G/5G options 
Display: 6.2-inch 120Hz OLED QHD+



The Samsung Galaxy S20 has been one of our favourite Android phones throughout 2020, especially if you’ve been after a device that isn’t huge.
While it’s a great Android phone, there are very few surprises here. It looks like a Samsung flagship, takes the kind of photos you expect from a Samsung flagship and has the same software as any other Samsung flagship. That’s not a bad thing, but there isn’t much here to bring in new fans.
However, with our reviews of the Samsung Galaxy S21 and the Galaxy S21 Ultra on their way and the cheaper Samsung Galaxy FE available now, the S20 might not quite as tempting now as it was on release.
However, it’s still a great device that can be had for less than it was at launch. Read our for our full in-depth Galaxy S20 review.

Screen – Its 120Hz refresh rate ensures it runs super-smooth
Displays on Samsung’s flagship have long been considered the best, and with the Galaxy S20, the company adds a much-requested feature: a 120Hz refresh rate. 
This means the slightly curved 6.2-inch OLED panel will refresh 120 times a second, rather than the 60 times a second you’ll find on pretty much every other 2019 handset. The result? Everything just feels far smoother, which gives the impression the phone is faster. This feature isn’t necessarily new – the OnePlus 7T Pro had a 90Hz display in 2019 – but it’s welcome, and it elevates the panel to the next level.

There is a catch with the 120Hz display, though: it will only work when the screen resolution is set to FHD and it won’t be on by default. If you want to use the S20’s QHD+ resolution to its full, you’ll need to dial things back to 60Hz. This is a shame since it means you’ll have to decide whether you plump for resolution or speed, sacrificing one of the phone’s features in the process. 
In real-world use, I can’t see anyone being disappointed when it’s set to FHD+ resolution. Everything remains sharp, colours pop without being overly rich, and blacks are perfectly deep. Like all Samsung screens, it’s truly a pleasure to use.
The reason for locking out 120Hz and QHD+ at the same time? The likelihood is it’s battery related. You’ll experience a notable drop in endurance with the smoother mode enabled – and even though I’m happy to take the hit, some may prefer to leave it set to 60Hz to get a few more hours of screen-on time.
The camera cutout remains, but it now mirrors the more inconspicuous design seen first on the Note 10. I didn’t find that the notch got in the way at all, whether watching videos or playing games. Most apps are now better accustomed to deal with the cutout – for example, you can force apps such as Netflix to cover the entire panel.
Camera – A huge improvement over the Galaxy S10
The camera is one the big focuses here. Even though it’s the Galaxy S20 Ultra that benefits from the fancy new additions (108-megapixel main sensor, 100x zoom, 40-megapixel selfie), the S20 offers a significant upgrade. I prefer the photos and shooting experience here anyway as S20 Ultra struggles with a load of focus issues. These were fixed on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. 
There are three main rear cameras: a wide 12-megapixel with an f/1.8 lens and OIS; an ultra-wide 12-megapixel; and a 64-megapixel telephoto with an f/2.0 lens and OIS. Samsung says the sensor on that main 12-megapixel camera has been completely rebuilt, with its bigger pixels allowing in more light. 

The most important thing for anyone upgrading from last year’s Galaxy S10 is that the resulting snaps are a huge leap forward. Samsung’s camera offering had stagnated for years, with the same sensor repeatedly used in its handsets. With the S20, the company kicks things up a gear.
The second key takeaway is just how bright, vivid and colourful outdoor and well-lit shots are. Without feeling oversaturated or fake, the photos are gloriously punchy, especially when compared to those produced by rival phones such as the Google Pixel 4 and Apple iPhone 11. This is still the case when compared to the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12. 
You can shoot at 64MP (this photo has been downsized for size)
Samsung has also seemingly altered its post-processing. No longer are reds and greens neon, with nature shots in particular feeling more lifelike. Images still display more sharpening than I like, giving buildings a hit of extra detail that isn’t to my taste. However, if you regularly run your photos through a sharpening tool before you upload to Instagram then you’ll probably appreciate the changes.
Details come across well in the dark and there’s a natural brightness
Low-light shots, too, are also noticeably better than anything I’ve seen from a Samsung phone before, even if the Pixel 5 still does a consistently better job at exposing correctly and getting the most detail out of night and bar shots. I’d avoid the Night mode completely, though: it adds a harsh yellow tinge to snaps. You’ll get better results using the natural skill of the sensor.
Colours are bright and there’s of detail in the shots
So, how does it compare to the S20 Ultra? In terms of zooming, the Ultra is king: anything up to 10x is far sharper, thanks to the dedicated zoom glass on the pricier device. However, the S20’s ability to focus is far nippier, plus the smaller sensor means that, overall, images will be crisper, without that blurry banding we’ve seen on the Ultra’s pics.
The zoom skills aren’t quite as good as the Ultra, but this 3x shot retains all the detail of the ball
All Galaxy S20 variants suffer from over-smoothing on portrait shots, with the texture on faces lost. But as with the extra sharpening, this won’t be an issue for some – but it’s not for me.
Video is another plus: 8K recording is present (using the tele sensor), although you’ll likely have no way to playback that footage. Nevertheless, it’s an impressive feature for a small phone such as the S20 to boast and the results are strong.

Design – Better-looking than the Ultra, but the Galaxy S20 design needs a refresh
Samsung hasn’t delivered a huge redesign of its flagship “S” handsets in several years – and, visually, the entire S20 series looks very much like handsets that have come before. 
But it’s difficult to see where any changes could be made. The front is just a big screen; the back is glass, with a smattering of curves that help the S20 nestle comfortably in your hand.

Having used all three Galaxy S20 models, I think the regular S20’s strongest attribute is just how good it feels to use. This, for me, is the perfect size for a phone. It’s small enough to use with one hand, yet packs a display that’s big enough for watching the odd YouTube clip or Netflix episode. Everything just feels right, from the narrow overall body to its minimal weight.
Glass covers the front and the rear of the device, and there’s quite a distinctive new camera layout on the back. It’s less intrusive than the one on the Ultra – there’s a far smaller sensor here and no periscope lens – and it adds an extra quirk to the design.
With phones such as the Oppo Find X2 Pro offering leather-back options, the design of the Galaxy S20 feels, well, a bit safe. The colour options lack any uniqueness, and the smudge-prone back is a step-backwards when we have phones such as the Pixel 4 and iPhone 11 Pro with their matte finishes. I just think Samsung could have done more.
One notable omission is a 3.5mm headphone port. The Galaxy S20 is the first S-series flagship to ditch it – while this has become the norm on flagships from Apple and OnePlus, Samsung has been late to join that party. You do get an “okay” pair of AKG-branded USB-C buds in the box, and Samsung has recently updated its true wireless headphone offering with the Galaxy Buds Plus. 
Thankfully, the phone retains its microSD slot and IP68 rating.
Performance and specs – The Galaxy S20 is fast and offers the smoothest Android experience around
Like its pricier sibling, the Galaxy S20 Ultra, the Galaxy S20 is impressive when it comes to specs. High-end internals range from the latest chips and type of RAM to support for the latest USB-C power delivery standards.
Interestingly, Samsung does offer a model of the Galaxy S20 without 5G (and slightly less RAM). This costs roughly £100/$100 less and is a good option if you have no interest in 5G if it isn’t available in your area yet, or simply because you want to save a bit of cash.
Powering my European Galaxy S20 device is the Exynos 990 7nm chipset; US devices will get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. I’m not a huge fan of the split chipset approach since in previous years the Snapdragon version has performed better and offered improved battery life.
It also features 12GB of LPDDR-5 RAM – and a clever software trick lets you force up to three apps to constantly stay in the RAM, meaning they won’t require you to keep restarting them every few hours. This is ideal if you play a specific game multiple times a day, for example, and it takes a long time to load up each go.
These fast internals, paired with the smooth 120Hz display, make for a phone that’s speedy in just about every way. Is that a surprise? Not really. Performance across even mid-range Android handsets is great these days. It’s about whether such performance continues 12-18 months down the line. Hopefully, the S20 will be better in this regard than previous entries in the series.
You’ll notice extra smoothness in games such as Alto’s Odyssey, which make the most of the 120Hz display – these really do look great. The improved 240Hz sampling rate also helps responsiveness in games that require a deft touch.
For those interested in the benchmark scores for the S20, see the table below. We’ve compared the device to some of the other flagship phones that come packing differing chipsets. The jump over last year’s devices isn’t huge, but benchmark data should always be taken with a pinch of salt. This new chip adds many extras that aren’t related to performance, such as support for 8K video and 5G.

The S20 isn’t all sweet-smelling roses, though. Audio from the speakers is tinny and muffled, and call quality isn’t up there with the best. I’m also not a fan of the optical in-display fingerprint scanner Samsung includes: it’s slow, takes a good few attempts to register my finger, and falls short of the physical sensors of a few years ago. At least there’s a rudimentary face-unlock system that allows access to the device far quicker.

Battery life – A mixed bag, but very fast charging
If you’ve read our Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra review then you’ll know we weren’t that impressed with its battery life, especially when you consider the size of the phone. I’m a little more accepting of the middling endurance of the S20 since smaller phones have smaller batteries (4000mAh here vs 5000mAh on the Ultra).
The issue is that 120Hz display. I managed 90-120 minutes less screen-on time with this option enabled during my week with the phone than when it was set to 60Hz (about four hours). Keep things at 60Hz and FHD+ and you’ll easily make it through the day without much fuss.
At least Samsung offers plenty of ways of stretching out that battery life. You can alter resolution, hamper the performance, turn off the non-essential functions; plus there are various battery-saver modes, each of which can be customised. Of course, none of this is ideal and is no replacement for actual great battery life – but that’s the price you pay for a display of this type.
When you’re not using the screen, battery performance is better. An hour of music streaming consumed less juice than the Pixel 4 XL while leaving the phone unplugged overnight saw a drop of just 5% – pretty good for an Android phone.
And when you do come to charge the phone the included 25w charger will take you from 0-100% in about 65 minutes. This increases to 90 minutes if you’re using a slower charger from an older Samsung phone or a generic PD charger and about 3 hours if you’re charging wirelessly. This might not be as fast as the Oppo Find X2 Pro which can get a full charge in 40 minutes, but it’s a big improvement nevertheless.
Software – Samsung’s One UI 2.1 is its best software yet
Once a reason to avoid Samsung phones, the One UI 2.1 Android here is the most complete and reliable skin yet to grace an S-series flagship. However, it isn’t Android as Google intended. This is very much Samsung’s software, with its own payment service, duplicate apps aplenty and password manager. If you want to avoid Google services completely then that is possible.
But in truth, there are more features here than you’ll see with most other Android UIs. DeX, for instance, allows you to use your phone on a Mac or PC or even a monitor.
There’s also a dark mode that works system-wide, across all supported apps, plus the ability to connect two Bluetooth devices at the same time; plus there are some great multi-tasking tools, popping apps out into separate windows, for example.
Bixby remains, although Samsung no longer forces it down your throat in the same way it has done in previous years. There’s no dedicated button for it and you can disable it popping up when you press down the lock key. The Bixby home screen has been ditched for Samsung Daily – a sort of equally useless panel of random integrations that can easily be disabled. 
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy S20?
For most people, the Samsung Galaxy S20 is still one of the best Android phone available right now. Especially with the cheaper prices around.
However, I would seriously consider the Galaxy S20 FE which has a Snapdragon 865 and better battery life, along with superior performance. There’s also the OnePlus 8T which has a similarly ace display and the Pixel 5 if you’re looking for something even smaller.

With the iPhone 12, Apple has brought many of its ‘Pro’ level features from last year’s iPhone 11 Pro down in price.
The iPhone 12 upgrades the screen, design, adds 5G and improves the cameras. It has seen a slight price increase as a result, however the benefits certainly mean it’s worth the extra cash.
All of Apple’s iPhone 12 models are now available and we’ve fully reviewed each. Our iPhone 12 Pro review looks at the differences between it and the cheaper model, while the iPhone 12 mini review focuses on the smaller model. We’ve also got an iPhone 12 Pro Max review – is the camera really so much better here?
Design – What’s old is new again
The iPhone 12 is a gorgeous phone and the best looking Apple phone since the iPhone 5 – a device this takes a lot of inspiration from. The rounded sides and slightly curved display have been replaced with flat edges and straight lines everywhere. It’s clean, supremely well built and an absolute pleasure to use.
It’s thinner, lighter, smaller and more ergonomic than the outgoing iPhone 11 and the flat sides make it far more comfortable to hold. Everything just works, from the size to the weight. It’s a tougher phone too, with more durable glass on the front and a better IP68 rating for splash, water and dust resistance. Apple now claims it’ll withstand a maximum depth of 6m for 30 minutes. 
Interestingly, the iPhone 12 is the exact same as the iPhone 12 Pro when it comes to dimensions and screen size. If you buy a case for one, it’ll work with the other. There are differences though: the iPhone 12 swaps stainless steel rails for cheaper aluminium and it’s noticeably lighter as a result. The Pro model also has a frosted glass back, while the 12 has a more glossy finish. It’s the opposite on the sides though, as the 12 goes matte here and the Pro goes (very) shiny.
In the lovely green colour my review unit came in, the back isn’t that susceptible to visible fingerprints, however this won’t be the case if you choose a darker model – the blue, black or red version, for example.

Whichever colour you choose, the hue wraps around the side and while the choice isn’t quite as varied as last year, each tone is tasteful.
Covering the front of the iPhone 12 is Apple’s new ‘Ceramic Shield’. This is developed in conjunction with Corning, from Gorilla Glass fame, and is, according to Apple, 4x better at withstanding drops. Apple has added nano-ceramic crystals into the glass which are said to make it much stronger and this is combined with the previously used dual ion-exchange for scratch resistance.
Now, and this is important, the iPhone 12 isn’t any more scratch resistant than the iPhone 11. And often when things become better at withstanding drops, they become more susceptible to other types of damage, like scratches. I haven’t noticed any scratches on mine so far, but this isn’t an excuse to ditch the screen protector if you would have used one before.

Screen – The iPhone 12 is a massive improvement over the 11
Apple skimped on the display of the iPhone 11. It wasn’t OLED like the Pro models, but LCD and it had a resolution that was only slightly above 720p. There was no HDR support either, leaving compatible media looking somewhat flat. With the iPhone 12, that’s all changed.
The new display is up there with the biggest upgrades this year and if you’re coming from an iPhone 11, iPhone XR or below you’ll notice it immediately. Apple might have some fantastic LCD displays, but the switch to OLED is welcome and the panel here is virtually indistinguishable from the one in the 12 Pro. Everything is more vivid, has better contrast and is generally more pleasing on the eye.
Using OLED also allows for the smaller bezel around the display and it enables HDR in formats like Dolby Vision and HLG. It’s sharper too, now over 1080p, and just generally much better.
One minor thing to note is that the 12 Pro model gets ever-so-slightly brighter in regular use, giving whites less of a grey tinge. You’ll really only notice this if you have the two side-by-side and they can both hit 1200 nits (according to Apple) when you’re playing back HDR content. Streaming Avengers: Endgame from Disney Plus in Dolby Vision is a great test for this screen and you notice that extra brightness in dark scenes heavy with gunfire and bright explosions.
At 6.1-inches, the screen here is a good, middle-ground size. Small enough to grip in one hand, but big enough to happily watch media and play games on without it feeling cramped. If you want bigger you’ll have to stump up for the Pro Max, while those after something more akin to older iPhones like the iPhone 5 should look at the iPhone 12 Mini. Apple’s done a fantastic job at catering for all sizes and I wish more Android manufacturers would follow its example.

There are a couple of areas where Apple can still improve the display experience, though. My main request is for a faster overall screen, upping that 60Hz to something closer to 90Hz or 120Hz. Android phones have been making use of these smoother, faster displays for a while now and even budget phones offer it.
I would also like Apple to finally find a way of reducing (or getting rid of) the notch. You’ll get used to it yes, and after a while I forget it’s there – but finding a more subtle way of hiding those Face ID sensor and giving us more screen real-estate in return should be high on the list for upgrades on iPhone 13.
Performance – 5G and a chip that’s leaves everything else behind
5G is the big new performance gain for the iPhone 12 and every model in the series has it. If you’re in the States you’ll have mmWave UWB 5G support on networks like Verizon, while us UK folks are restricted to the more widespread sub–6Ghz bands. Annoyingly, we’re still paying the same price, even though the UK model lacks the mmWave antennas. It would have been nice for Apple, like Google did with the two Pixel 5 versions, to start with a lower price here.
It’s worth saying right away that even though networks and Apple want you to think 5G is a reason to upgrade or buy this iPhone, I don’t think it is. It’s still only available in small portions of even supported areas, seems pretty hit-or-miss in terms of speed when compared to 4G still and does hammer battery life if you’re pushing it with downloads. Apple seems to agree, at least in part, as a Smart 5G feature will bring you back to 4G if it thinks what you’re doing doesn’t really warrant those extra speeds.
Related: What is 5G?
In a year, or two, when 5G in more widespread and we’re out again attending gigs, large sporting events and festivals then the benefits will likely be a lot more obvious. For now though, it’s a nice to have rather than a must.
Powering the iPhone 12 is the A14 Bionic chipset. This is the same chip you’ll find powering the new iPad Air and I would assume some version will also provide the grunt for the ARM Apple Silicon Macs. It’s a triumph of engineering, built on the supremely efficient 5nm process and is the likely reason why battery life is roughly the same as the iPhone 11 even with the additions of 5G and a better display. It’s a brute in terms of performance too, racking up Geekbench 5 scores that tower over anything you’ll find on an Android phone. I ran the synthetic CPU benchmark and got multi-score of 3927, with a single-core 1590 result.
A lot of the power from this chip is used in parts of the phone you won’t immediately notice. Whether it’s enabling Dolby Vision recording or the AI elements in the camera, that beefier chip isn’t just there to make your homescreen flow faster or games load quicker.
In general day-to-day performance, the iPhone 12 is very quick and while it’s just as nippy as the Pro, I don’t think you’ll notice much difference unless you’re upgrading from a really old iPhone. iPhones have, to me, always felt and stayed fast and this is no different.
The only real difference in terms of specs between the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro is that the latter has a bit more RAM: 6GB, as opposed to 4GB. You likely won’t notice this benefit yet though, and I certainly couldn’t. You also get 128GB storage as standard on the Pro, as opposed to 64GB here. 
Audio from the speakers is great (loud, detailed and without distortion even at full volume), call quality is strong and there’s Wi-Fi 6 support if you have the right router. 
iOS 14 is installed on the iPhone 12 and we’ve rounded up all the best iOS 14 features right here. I have noticed a couple of bugs,  but hopefully they’ll be squashed asap.
Camera – Another great iPhone camera, even if the upgrades are minimal
The iPhone 12 has seen many big upgrades over its predecessor and that makes the changes to the camera feel a bit less substantial. There is new stuff and some obvious improvements, especially when you’re shooting low-light, but generally the photos I have taken look very much like those from the iPhone 11 series.
Related: Best camera phones
That’s far from a bad thing, though. The main 12-megapixel sensor now has a faster f/1.6 7 element lens and it’s paired with a 12MP ultrawide camera too. If you want telephoto (and the perks of the LiDAR sensor) there’s the iPhone 12 Pro.
The real strength of the iPhone 12’s camera is in its reliability. The Smart HDR 3 and Deep Fusion tech inside the camera app does a stunning job at levelling out colours and dynamic range. It does an almost unmatched job of ensuring exposure is correct in every photo. If you’re taking tricky shots with multiple levels of brightness then the iPhone 12 can handle it with ease and this is not something I can say about every phone from Huawei, Samsung and others.

The f/1.6 aperture helps in darker scenarios, as it lets more light (27% according to Apple) into the sensor. I have found snaps in situations where the dedicated Night Mode doesn’t activate are a little bit sharper with far better colour and highlight reproduction than the 11 Pro, and a lot better overall than those an iPhone XS. As I would guess most people are upgrading from a two-year-old phone that’s really the most important metric.
Another notable change with the iPhone 12 is that Night Mode and Deep Fusion work across both sensors. This improves night shots in the ultrawide, however the shots are still inferior just down to the sensor not being quite as capable. Night Mode on the main camera is still great and if you’re coming from an iPhone pre-11 then you’ll be blown away by what you can achieve with little to no light. Even the upgrade over the iPhone 11 Pro is noticeable here very obviously here, with colours coming across far brighter.
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews) : Even with Night Mode off, low light shots are great. Colours, especially, are bright
The front camera is very much the same as before. It’s a 12MP sensor, with an f/2.2 aperture and it’s used mainly for the Face ID unlocking system. Selfies are fine, but they can look a little washed out when compared to the overtly contrasty look you’ll get from a Pixel 5.
Video has always been a highlight of the iPhone. With iPhone 12 things are improved once again and for pure video quality you won’t find better, aside from the with the iPhone 12 Pro which can do the HDR tricks in 4K 60fps.
The big new addition is HDR recording. HDR gives you better contrast, brighter colours and an overall pleasing look. Here, HDR video is recorded in an HLG format with some Dolby Vision encoding on top. That’s beside the point though, as the results are stunning and especially when viewed on the iPhone 12’s HDR screen. Colours pop, skies stand out even and there’s a real energy that now feels missing when I go back to the iPhone 11. You can easily share these videos with other iPhone users, but sharing elsewhere gets a bit messy due to a lack of HDR support in the formats used here. 
Battery life – You’ll need to provide your own charger
There were notable gains across the board in terms of battery life last year, however things are more modest with the iPhone 12. The 2815mAh (same in both the 12 and 12 Pro) battery has been getting me roughly the same about of juice as the 11, which is impressive considering all the extra benefits you’re getting. 
The lack of huge jump in endurance might irk some though and this remains a phone you’ll most likely be charging every day.
Per charge, I have been getting around 6 hours of screen on time and this is very much the same as the 12 Pro. An hour of HDR streaming from Netflix ate through 8%.
Now, there are some caveats here. Due to the ‘current situation’, I am using Wi-Fi more and mobile networks less. I also don’t live in a reliable 5G area (sometimes it pops up, but speeds are rarely faster than 4G) so if you’re pounding downloads on a 5G network expect to hit 0% far quicker.
Probably the biggest controversy with the iPhone 12 is the lack of a plug in the box. There’s just a USB C cable and, well, nothing else. EarPods and a wall brick have been ditched, which make for a far slimmer box and hopefully a benefit to the environment in the long run. I’m all for this decision, but I do think Apple’s way of dealing with it is a bit odd.
While it’s great the included cable is USB C, very few people (I would suggest) would have plentiful USB bricks lying around their house. This would be nulled somewhat if Apple has switched the phone over to USB C so could use the same plug and cable combi you charge an iPad or laptop with, but it didn’t. Lightning remains and I just can’t see why.
Also, if you’re encouraging people to reuse a charger from an older iPhone then they’re going to be suffering from seriously slow charging speeds. A 5w brick (the one you’d have with all iPhones aside from the Pro models like year) will take over hours and hours to charge this. While a 20w brick takes you to 50% in just over 30 minutes.
Image Credit (Trusted Reviews)
Realistically you’re going to want to buy a 20w plug to use with this phone and that’s another expense.
You’ll also need one of those 20w plugs if you want to use the new MagSafe charger –  a £40/$40 magnetic wireless charger that’s part of a whole new range of add-ons. It uses magnets, NFC and the Qi standard to charge your iPhone 12 at 15w, giving you about 50% in an hour. I’ve gone into depth on MagSafe here. iPhone 12 still works with other Qi chargers, with speeds topping out at 7.5w.

Should you buy the iPhone 12?
The iPhone 12 truly is a notable jump for Apple’s mainline phone and it now feels almost as Pro as the actual Pro model. For £799/$799, this is a seriously complete device.
Related: Best phone
The screen is great (even if a higher refresh rate screen would be nice), design the best you’ll find at the minute and the cameras reliably take ace snaps in all manner of conditions. There’s also 5G, HDR video recording, all the benefits of iOS and MagSafe.

If you’re in the market for the biggest, longest-lasting and most photographically advanced iPhone you can buy, then you’ll want the iPhone 12 Pro Max.
And when we say “biggest”, we mean it – this is the largest iPhone ever, to the point it can sometimes be a little tricky to hold. That gripe aside, this is ultimately the best entry in Apple’s 2020 line.
I have covered plenty on the iPhone 12 series already, so check out our iPhone 12 review and iPhone 12 Pro review for deeper dives to find out everything you need to know about these devices. Below, I’ll focus on how the Pro Max compares, and the extra goodies you get for that price.
Camera 

Are the differences noticeable over the smaller 12 Pro?

There’s a lot of interest surrounding the 12 Pro Max’s camera – and, aside from the size, it’s the aspect that sets the iPhone 12 Pro Max most apart from the 12 Pro.

While both cameras have three 12-megapixel sensors on the rear,  the main wide sensor on the Pro Max is much larger and is therefore able to let in more light. The telephoto camera is also slightly more zoomed, with a 65mm focal range.
If you want the very best iPhone for taking photos, then the 12 Pro Max is the handset to choose. I wouldn’t say it’s a night and day difference over the already very capable 12 Pro; instead, it delivers subtle improvements in a number of areas. Using the Night mode, for instance, is far quicker and the improved zoom lets you to get a little bit closer to the subject.
Many of the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s camera skills are courtesy of the A14 Bionic chipset and the strong focus on computational photography. There’s Deep Fusion for pulling out more detail in certain instances, and Smart HDR 3 for levelling out exposure and ensuring your pictures look good no matter the environment. You’re not even required to engage these features; they simply do their work in the background, eliminating much of the guesswork of snapping pictures.
Colours are supremely attractive
 
Detail is rich
 
There’s a good natural background blue
 
…and again
Smart HDR helps to bring out colours, adding a more pleasing look to photos while continuing to keep things looking accurate. 
Night mode is another computational feature, which engages automatically if it detects the shot needs it. This takes multiple pictures at varying exposures and then stitches them together, adding far greater brightness than you’d think possible, without sacrificing detail. The larger sensor here lets in more light, without you having to hold the phone still for as long as you would with the iPhone 12 Pro. This is a  welcome upgrade, and means you’ll get a better return on your night-time photography. Night mode also works with the ultra-wide camera now, giving you a bit more versatility.
Night mode: This was taken in near-pitch darkness
The ultra-wide camera is the least interesting of the three, despite adding extra variety. It’s the same as the one that features on the 12 Pro, taking very similar snaps to the iPhone 11 Pro series. Hopefully, we’ll see big improvements in this area next year. The same applies to the selfie camera.
I’ve been shooting with the 12 Pro Max for a few weeks now, pitting it against not only the other iPhone 12 handset but older versions of the iPhone too. The improvements Apple has made in a few years, especially from the X and XS, is clear with just about every shot. Colours and dynamic range are noticeably better in images captured with the new model.
However, if you were expecting the sensor in the 12 Pro Max would push it comfortably ahead of the 12 and 12 Pro then you might be a little disappointed. In several scenarios, I struggled to notice a difference, with the benefits of the computational back-end far outweighing the added smarts of the sensor. You’ll see marginally more natural depth in portraits, ever so slightly more brightness in darker scenes, and slightly punchier colours in certain situations. However, you will have to be looking for these differences, though.
Still, in my opinion this is the best camera phone for overall photo quality, and the bar is set high for rival handsets to match in 2021. Skin tones are natural, detail is exceptional without feeling artificial, and overall it just feels super-reliable – of the hundreds of shots I captured over the review period, there were hardly any that were out of focus or unusable.
It’s the best handset for video, too, with HDR shooting in a Dolby Vision format for extracting seriously bright video. This can be turned off if you want better compatibility or simply want captured footage to take up less space, but in the main, if you watch video on your phone, it’s worth keeping on.
Apple’s camera app remains one of the most basic around, and we would welcome deeper control. For instance, you can’t enable the Night mode manually. A new ProRAW format is coming soon and this should let you edit a DNG file with all the computational benefits intact.
Where the iPhone 12 Pro Max does fall behind slightly against some of the Android competition is in its zoom offering. On the 12 Pro Max you get a 2.5x (65mm equivalent) lens for getting closer to a subject, but this pales in comparison to handsets such as the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. These devices use periscope-style lenses to create optical zooming up to 10x – and the results are usually very impressive.
At least the focal length is longer than the iPhone 12 Pro; however, in return it has narrower aperture so less light gets into the sensor.
New sensor-shift stabilisation means the whole sensor moves, rather than just the lens – and, while this is only present on the main camera, it’s effect can often be very obvious. There’s a LiDAR sensor, too, which helps autofocus accuracy in low-light conditions.
Design and screen

Oh boy, this handset is the definition of big

Apple has modified the iPhone design this time around, switching from the slightly tired rounded look since the iPhone 6 to something more akin to the iconic iPhone 4 and iPhone 5. The 12 Pro Max is boxy, angular and features straight lines everywhere.
I’ve covered design in more depth in our iPhone 12 Pro review. Here, everything is much the same – just a lot bigger and heavier.
The flat sides are stainless steel and have a shiny, glossy finish that attracts a lot of fingerprints. The level of sheen will vary depending on the colour you plump for, with the sides of my graphite review model looking far more subtle than the ostentatious gold version.
iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 mini
Flip over the phone over and you’ll find a matte finish on the rear. Fingerprints and smudges aren’t an issue here, with the finish helping to add more grip than the glossy back of the iPhone 12. The front is home to the same Ceramic Shield glass as the rest of the iPhone 12 line – which, Apple says, offers four times better drop protection than previous models. Thankfully, I haven’t had these claims tested as yet. Don’t expect improved protection from scratches, though – and if you’d normally affix a screen protector on a new phone then our advice is to do so with this handset.
Even from someone who has been using an iPhone 11 Pro Max for most of the year, the 12 Pro Max feels bigger and more difficult to hold. I think much of this is down to the switch from curved to flat sides – and while I prefer the look, at this size you have to do a lot of hand gymnastics to keep a firm grip.
The 12 Pro Max is also slightly longer than the 11 Pro Max, with a marginally bigger display. You’ve now got a 6.7-inch panel, rather than a 6.5-inch. This isn’t the biggest screen around, but it is one of the biggest phones.

On the whole, the large display is impressive, making this – as expected – the best iPhone 12 for watching movies, gaming and just getting stuff done. It would be nice if iOS would let you use more of this huge canvas to have multiple apps open at once, for example, but this isn’t possible. Maybe in iOS 15 – although I do feel that if Apple was going to do this, it would have done so by now.
The OLED display is bright (a reported 1200 nits when viewing HDR content) and in terms of colour accuracy, the 12 Pro Max is my favourite. It offers a lovely mix of saturation and realism that’s often lost elsewhere.
HDR content from iTunes, Disney Plus and Netflix look great, and this is one of the few phones where the benefits of HDR are clear to see. The higher levels of sustained brightness, perfect blacks and general panel quality make this screen excellent for movie watching.
There are a couple of issues that are likely to irritate some, though. The iPhone 12 Pro Max retains the notch, and decides against switching to a faster 90 or 120Hz refresh-rate – something just about every new mid-range and flagship Android phone has adopted this year.
All the iPhone 12 models
For me, the notch is fine. Apple needs that space for the very good Face ID sensors, and on such a large panel it doesn’t obstruct that much anyway. The lack of a high refresh-rate screen is more of a shame, since it would have given the device even more gloss, with even smoother scrolling and more responsive gaming. 
Performance

High-end chip, 5G and huge storage options

The 12 Pro Max offers improvements over the other iPhone 12 models in terms of the camera and battery life (which I’ll cover further down), but it doesn’t come with any more power than the iPhone 12. Aside from an extra 2GB of RAM (6GB as opposed to 4GB), the A14 Bionic chipset is the same across the entire range.
Related: What is 5G?
Keeping parity across the series is great – and, from a technical standpoint, this is one of the most impressive chips I’ve ever seen. Built using a 5nm process, it seems very much to be the basis of the M1 chips inside the new MacBooks. It’s fast enough to run any app or game from the App Store and it plays through Apple Arcade titles with ease.
The extra power of this chip might not be immediately obvious, especially if you’re coming from an already very fast iPhone from the past two or three years. However, it does offer benefits as we’ve mentioned, in other areas such as the camera and battery life.
It’s a 5G phone, which is handy if you’re in a supported area but isn’t really a reason to upgrade. There’s Wi-Fi 6, too, which is great if you have a supported router.
All the new iPhone 12 sizes
Apple’s Pro phones have ditched an initial offering of 64GB of storage, instead starting at 128GB. There’s a 256GB option, too, and a 512GB variant if you’re a fan of keeping everything offline. We’d say 256GB is the sweet spot; however, if you’re planning to shoot lots of video at HDR 60fps, then we’d go for the most generous storage option.
Battery life

It’s the best iPhone 12 in this area, by some distance

If battery life is high on your wishlist when upgrading then the 12 Pro Max is for you. This is the longest-lasting iPhone 12 model by some distance, almost reaching the heights set by the 11 Pro Max. Considering this is a thinner device, with a bigger screen and support for 5G, that’s impressive.
Throughout my time with the phone, I struggled to deplete its cell in a day, even with intensive use. I would average 8 to 9 hours of screen-on time for its gauge to hit 0% – and, in many cases, it lasted through two full days if I was working from home. That’s impressive, although I do admit this was all over Wi-Fi. If you’re pummelling it with 5G then expect far less.
Unfortunately, when it comes to charging, you’ll notice the box is light on accessories. While a a USB-C to Lightning cable is included, you won’t find a plug or pair of EarPods no matter how deep you delve. Of course, you could use a charger from an older iPhone, but unless it’s one from the 11 Pro line, you’ll be waiting upwards of 3 hours for a full charge. Your best bet is Apple’s £19/$19 USB-C 20w plug or something similar, which charges to 50% in about 30 minutes.
Another charging solution is via the MagSafe charger, a wireless puck that clips magnetically to the phone’s rear. It uses Qi for wireless charging, but it’s faster (15w rather than 7.5w) than any other wireless iPhone charger. It’s a neat add-on, even if the charger itself costs £39/$39 – and then you’ll need another 20w Apple plug to get those speeds. Other Qi chargers work, too, if very slowly.

Should you buy the iPhone 12 Pro Max?
The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the most expensive iPhone 12, costing £100/$100 more than the iPhone 12 Pro. However, since Apple was responsible for making £1000 handsets ‘a thing’ with the iPhone X, it’s no longer alone; the 12 Pro Max is far from the priciest device around. It’s the same price as the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Oppo Find X2 Pro, and cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and S20 Ultra.
The iPhone 12 Pro Max truly is an excellent handset, as long as you’re willing to embrace such a sizeable phone. It offers fantastic battery life, a marginally better camera than the smaller Pro, and a screen that’s a pleasure for watching, reading and playing.

Verdict




























 



The Sony Xperia 10 II is an attractive phone, with its design easily the main appeal. The 21:9 is a handy treat for those who like the novelty of Android multitasking and widescreen content. However, sub-par performance, a middling screen and disappointing camera features leave the door open for stronger rivals to nab your cash.



Pros

Premium design
Decent 21:9 display
Useful fingerprint sensor
Strong camera basics
Water-resistance



Cons

Mediocre performance
Slippery
Below average battery life capabilities

Android 10



The Sony Xperia line is a veteran of the smartphone space and has gone through several reinventions. The current lineup offers stand-out features such as a wider aspect ratio and focus on the camera – but can the budget Sony Xperia 10 II stand up to tough competition from some of the best cheap phones?
Sony’s Xperia lineup offers a more simplified range of handsets compared to its rivals and generations of Xperia past. There’s the ultra-premium Sony Xperia 1 II, the standard flagship Sony Xperia 5 II and, lastly, the sub-£400 Sony Xperia 10 II.
This simplicity extends beyond just naming conventions, with all three devices focusing on similar features, just with varying amounts of cash behind them. However, the more premium models see Sony pack a hefty punch behind key features such as camera quality and a cinematic display. Without them, can the Xperia 10 II still stand out against rivals in this highly populated price range.
Design and Screen

21:9 screen is great for movies
Strong glass on front and back
OLED panel with a FHD+ panel

There are a lot of budget phones available now that offer specs that are far beyond what you’d have expected for their price; however, most are – to be frank – ugly.
There are some exceptions, of course, such as the Realme 7 and Realme 7 Pro – but most, quite reasonably, focus on function over form. With the Xperia 10 II, Sony opts to go in the opposite direction, delivering a handset that would easily leave most folk stunned that you can pick up this premium-feeling device for under £350.

The Sony Xperia 10 II sports that tried-and-trusted glass sandwich formula – Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and back, in this case – and a long and thin body. The combo certainly makes it eye-catching next to rivals, and it’s the phone to buy if good looks are a priority but your budget doesn’t extend through the roof.
The rails around the device are plastic, not that you’d have guessed if I hadn’t just divulged that information. The matte finish complements the shiny glass, while also providing some much welcome additional grip.
And the latter is super-important if you’re used to a more traditional 16:9 device. Note that you may experience some thrills and spills while you get used to handling the Xperia 10 II – but rest assured, you will get used to it.
Its narrow form means you can actually wrap your hand around the Xperia 10 II quite securely, which is great. However, it’s when moving across the glass with the 21:9 form factor that can cause some issues.

The display itself looks strong on paper: a 6-inch 21:9 FHD+ OLED. Unfortunately, for media consumption, it doesn’t quite deliver. Don’t get me wrong, for browsing web pages and general day-to-day use the device is great. But, when you dive into image/video-heavy apps (such as social media) or for watching content, a lack of sharpness and a cool look to the colours are certainly noticeable.
As mentioned above, if you’re coming to this display from a more conventional setup, then it may take some getting used to – but, once you’re there, the 21:9 aspect ratio rewards with a more cinematic experience, even if the media that supports the wider format is quite limited.
Performance

No 5G support
Qualcomm mid-range Snapdragon 665 chipset

While the Snapdragon 765G is running rampant across mid-range Android phones, some devices refrain, instead opting for Qualcomm’s lower offerings such as the Snapdragon 665 here (yes, that means no 5G).
Combine this particular Snapdragon chip with just 4GB of RAM and you get what might be the biggest shortcoming of the Xperia 10 II.
It’s by no means a deal-breaker, but Sony’s budget phone offers noticeably slower performance than some rivals – in particular, when put up against those devices featuring more RAM. For many of your day-to-day tasks the Xperia 10 II will be fine; but it’s under more intense stress, when you bound from app to app, that you’ll be met with some resistance. Thankfully, I didn’t experience any crashes, but it’s unlikely you’ll go a day without waiting that extra second or two for apps to load.
The slower performance is more of an issue when engaging one of this phone’s most prominent features – utilising multi-window to take advantage of the 21:9 aspect ratio. Once you have your favourite app pairs setup, it works like a dream. Watching YouTube while browsing Twitter, for example, but without the need for pop-out window support, is a delight. However, getting to that point will see your Sony phone working at its slowest, as you struggle to select your desired pairs of apps.
Thankfully, the device proves more snappy elsewhere; in particular, with the fingerprint sensor incorporated into the power button. It’s extremely responsive across the whole button, swiftly taking you to your home screen.
Audio performance is surprisingly good given the use of a mono speaker setup, offering fairly clear and loud sound. The speaker is located towards the bottom edge of the display, so it isn’t as easy to obstruct as it is on devices that where speakers are mounted on the bottom rail of the device – as is the case with many modern phones. While the audio is decent enough for watching the odd video out-loud, you’ll probably want to take advantage of the handy headphone jack for Bluetooth headphones for regular listening.
Camera

Great for daytime shots in good light
Zoom and low-light shots not as impressive 

The Sony Xperia 10 II offers a decent photography experience for those who want a phone for capturing spontaneous moments, it’s not one of the best camera phones around though.

Where the Sony falls down somewhat is in the quality of other features. From the zoom to Night mode, the results are either disappointing or just okay.


The wide and ultra-wide lens are a bit of an improvement, offering snaps with only slightly reduced detail compared to the main sensor. However, once again, you’ll get the best results when using this snapper for the simplest of shots, where its performance exceeds that of its closest rivals.
Battery life

You’ll only find a slow charger in the box
Decent battery life, but not one of the best skills here

The Sony Xperia 10 II manages a decent, if unremarkable, five to six hours of screen-on time in real-world use. This would be fine if Sony had included a decent charger in the box. In a world where most smartphone manufacturers, even at the budget-end of the market, are offering super-fast wired charging, the Xperia 10 II is lagging behind.
Most annoyingly, the Xperia 10 II is actually capable of decent 18W charging. However, Sony only offers a 7.5W charger in the box. As a result, charging from 0% to 50% will take around an hour – a snail’s pace compared to rivals from Realme, Oppo and OnePlus.
You should buy it if…
You want an OLED panel on the cheap
Sony could have plumped for a cheaper LCD here, but instead it has used an OLED display offering far better contrast, punchier colours and deeper blacks.
You watch a lot of videos
The 21:9 display is ideal for movies shot in the format and it makes videos on the whole much more immersive. 
You shouldn’t buy it if…
Great battery life is key
During the review process, I found that battery life here was far from excellent and the included charger is very slow. 
You want 5G right now
Even though this is a fairly affordable device, there is similarly priced competition with 5G support. If you want a phone for the long-haul, it might be worth looking at one of those instead. 

FAQs
Is the Sony Xperia 10 ii dual sim? Yes, there is a dual SIM version  What is sony xperia 10 ii release date? Sony released the Xperia 10 ii in May 2020  Is the Sony Xperia 10 ii waterproof? Sony has certified the Xperia 10ii  at IP68, so it can be submerged for 1.5m for 30m

Verdict


































If you’re looking for an iPhone 12 and think picking up the mini version will save you £100/$100, then I think you’re looking at it wrong. You shouldn’t buy this iPhone because it’s cheaper, you should buy it if you’ve been hankering for a smaller phone and are happy with the sacrifices that come with it. For most people, I still think the regular iPhone 12 is the best buy.



Pros
Great to see phones this size make a returnNo feature sacrifices for the smaller displayGreat camera with excellent videoLovely new design

Cons
Battery life is notably worse than other iPhone 12 modelsNotch seems more irritating on the smaller screenYou’ll want to buy a charger separately

Key Specifications
5.4-inch OLED displayApple A14 Bionic chipset5G2x 12MP rear camerasMagSafe


If you’re tired of big phones, but don’t want to sacrifice camera quality and high-end performance, the iPhone 12 mini is an instant recommendation.
Unlike Apple’s other smaller, cheaper phone the iPhone SE 2, the iPhone 12 mini doesn’t really sacrifice much to achieve its miniature footprint. It has the same camera setup, same A14 Bionic chipset and same support for 5G as the full-fat iPhone 12.
It also has the same overall design, featuring iPhone 5-like edges and a nice selection of muted colours.
Design – The iPhone 12 mini is small on a scale we haven’t seen in years
The iPhone 12 mini is really that – a miniature iPhone 12. It’s far smaller than I was expecting and it’s dwarfed by the Pixel 4a, which is probably the smallest new Android phone around. I can wrap my whole hand around its aluminium body and comfortably reach the top with my thumb, something that’s not even possible on the still comparably small iPhone 12.
It’s really quite something, especially when you consider Apple has managed to bring across all the major features – both hardware and software – from the larger models. This is rare, with smaller devices (Xperia Compact aside) usually sacrificing most of what makes there larger siblings special.
In terms of overall design, the mini is the same as the 6.1-inch iPhone 12. It has shiny glass on the back that picks up lots of fingerprints, especially in this dark blue colour, and matte aluminium rails around the sides. It’s a very flat device and will feel familiar to anyone who used the iPhone 4 or 5, or even the most recent iPad Air and iPad Pro. The flat edges help it sit comfortably in your palm and it’s so incredibly light at 135g that’s it refreshing.
I can easily wrap my hand around the iPhone 12 mini
Related: Best iPhone
I delve into the new Ceramic Shield front in our iPhone 12 review, but basically this is a new glass covering over the display that has been developed to better withstand drops. It won’t necessarily help avoid scratches and it won’t replace a screen protector, but it should give your phone more chance of surviving a drop.
Being smaller, I actually found the iPhone 12 mini far more durable feeling that the larger phones, especially the Pro Max. Whereas the Pro Max felt like it can (and likely would) slip out of my hand at any time, the smaller dimensions do the opposite. There’s an IP68 water resistance rating here too, adding that extra peace of mind.
All the new iPhone 12 sizes
Multiple colours are available and they’re all slightly more muted than last year. I’ve been using the blue, which is nice around the rails but a little less so on the lighter back. My pick is green, which is a lovely pastel shade that pops and does a good job at reducing fingerprints. There’s also a black, white and a vivid red.
A notable new addition for the iPhone 12 is the MagSafe, a new accessory ecosystem that works with a number of magnets built into the back of the phone. There are MagSafe cases (which honestly seem to make zero use of the magnets), a clever wireless charger and a card sleeve. Belkin is also making a handy looking car mount that should hold the phone in place solely with magnets. 
The back is super glossy and reflective
Display – Not for movie binges, but still packing quality tech
In terms of tech and overall screen quality, the iPhone 12 mini packs the same goodies as the larger models. The panel is OLED for perfect blacks and high levels of contrast, it has a much sharper resolution when compared to the iPhone 11 and supports both Dolby Vision and HLG HDR formats. 
Outside of this, it misses out on a faster 90 or 120Hz refresh rate – a common feature of newer Android phones – and a noticeable notch remains. I actually found the notch far more distracting here than on the other iPhone 12 models so beware of this if you’re not a huge fan of the cutout.
A faster refresh rate would, of course, have been nice. The benefit it gives to smoother scrolling and more responsive gaming is hard to pass up on Android, but on iOS the animations are smooth enough for it not to be a huge issue.
You’re probably most interested in the size of the display, and at 5.4-inches it’s the smallest in Apple’s current lineup. And unlike the iPhone SE, the screen stretches right out to the edges so there’s very little wasted space.
iPhone 4s (L) and iPhone 12 mini (R)
While it’s small in comparison to other iPhones and just about every Android phone on the market, it’s only marginally smaller than the screen on one of the older ‘Plus’ sized iPhones that all had 5.5-inch panels. And they were massive.
Still, having a smaller panel does change how you use a phone. I use the mini far less for watching videos and reading, switching to an iPad for that instead. This phone is more focussed on the phone basics – messaging, emails and the odd social media scroll. It’s a similar story for games: basic ones are fine, but the more intensive ones feel a little cramped here. That’s not so much a dig at the phone, but small screens in general. 

Phone habits have changed as screens have grown and if your phone is the hub to all manner of entertainment services then you might feel restricted here. If you just want a great phone that’ll fit in most pockets and small bags then it works great.
Performance – the same as the Pro Max
You have to hand it to Apple for its commitment to bringing the same high-class performance to the entire iPhone 12 line. 
Even though it’s essentially half the price of some iPhone 12 Pro Max models, you’ve still got the same highly efficient A14 Bionic chipset that comfortably handles any task you throw at it with ease. While it’s a lot more technically advanced, you’re likely not going to notice any huge ‘wow’ moment if you’re coming from an iPhone from the past few years. These phones have been fast for a while and this is no different.
I ran a few synthetic benchmarks on the iPhone 12 mini and it falls into line with the other models in the range. In Geekbench it scored 1592 in single-core and 4118 in the multi-core variant.
5G makes a debut on an iPhone this year. As with the chipset improvements, 5G feels more like a ‘nice to have’ rather than something that’ll change the way you use the phone – especially as it’s still very much in its infancy.
If you’re in a 5G area, on a 5G supported network and have the right plan then you can get far quicker downloads.
One thing I did notice after moving from the regular iPhone 12 to the mini is the speaker is notably weaker here, probably not too much of a surprise given the difference in size. It still sounds fine, but it is certainly lacking some of the oomph I noticed on the bigger phones.
Related: Best phone
iOS 14 comes preinstalled and it’s a hefty update. The home screen can now be littered with handy widgets and you can move lesser-used apps away into an App Library. Expect plenty more updates too, as Apple tends to support devices for years and years.
The base model comes with 64GB storage which does feel a bit light. I would recommend paying the extra £50/$50 and bumping that to 128GB.

Camera – The iPhone 12 mini has a fantastic snapper in a tiny package
As quickly became the theme with the 12 mini, the camera is identical to that on the 6.1-inch iPhone 12. No sacrifices were made to meet the smaller size and during my time shooting with it I didn’t pick up on any differences. That’s great news, as this is easily the best camera in a phone of this size.
The main 12-megapixel sensor now has a faster (when compared to the iPhone 11) f/1.6 7 element lens and it’s paired with a 12MP ultrawide camera. If you want telephoto, along with the perks of the LiDAR sensor, there’s the iPhone 12 Pro or the Max. Though I would assume if you’re taking the mini seriously you would have little interest in Apple’s biggest phone.
As I said in the camera portion of our iPhone 12 review, there’s not a huge jump in quality here over the iPhone 11. I doubt too many people are upgrading from that, unless the small phone is simply a must, and if you’re coming from something like the iPhone 6, 7 or 8 then you’ll notice huge strides. I’d also say the difference is obvious when compared to iPhone X and XS, both of which I felt lacked the lovely colour range achieved here.
Apple has really nailed making a phone that reliably takes excellent phones, regardless of environment, and without much effort. Even more so than a Pixel, I find pretty much every shot from the iPhone 12 mini is usable, with Apple’s large amount of computational tech working some magic in the background.



Ultra wide
The combination of Smart HDR 3 and Deep Fusion inside the camera app do a fantastic job at levelling out colours and dynamic range. This all happens live too, so what you’re seeing in the viewfinder is what you’ll get at the end. The iPhone 12 mini also uses Night Mode and Deep Fusion across both sensors, so you have more versatility at night to boot.
This, along with the slightly faster f/1.6 lens, aids low-light photography. This is the area you’ll notice most of the improvements. More detail is retained and you get a brighter image, even if you’re not using the multi-exposure Night Mode.
 
The ultrawide camera is nice to have and it adds a bit more scope to get creative. The snaps aren’t quite at the same quality of the main camera, especially in worse conditions, but I do appreciate having it.
On the front, the camera is the same as before. It’s a 12MP sensor, with an f/2.2 aperture and it’s used mainly for the Face ID unlocking system. Selfies are fine, but they can look a little washed out when compared to the overtly contrasty look you’ll get from a Pixel 5.
Completing the camera package is the video capabilities. The iPhone has long been king when it comes to smartphone videography and that’s once again the case here. The big new feature is HDR recording in a form of Dolby Vision. When viewing on your iPhone display it looks ace, with far better dynamic range and a real pop of cinematic colour. You might run into compatibility problems if you’re big into sharing video, though.

Battery life – Small battery for a small phone
The one real issue I have with the iPhone 12 mini is that the battery life falls comfortably below what I got on the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro. That’s probably to be expected with a smaller device with a smaller battery, but it still hampers the experience.
The battery life isn’t necessarily bad, it’s just nowhere near as good as what I know iPhones are capable of. For instance, I found the iPhone 12 mini had roughly 15-20% less battery at the end of the day when compared to an iPhone 12.
You can still make it through the day, especially if you’re not pushing the media and gaming capabilities quite so much, but you might be checking that battery indicator far more than you’d want to if it’s a heavy day.
There’s no charger in the box with the iPhone 12 mini and even if you have an old wall plug from an iPhone 7 or 8 you’ll probably want to invest in something faster, like Apple’s £19/$19 20w plug. Combine this with the included USB-C to Lightning and you’ll get a 50% in roughly 30 minutes.
There’s also the wireless option. You can use any old Qi charger here or pick up Apple’s MagSafe charger for faster speeds. While the other iPhone 12 models can charge at 15w with MagSafe, with the mini it maxing out at 12w. You won’t notice much difference though as the battery here is smaller, and it takes about double the length of time to reach 50% when compared to wired charging.
Should you buy the iPhone 12 mini?
If you’re looking for an iPhone 12 and think picking up the mini version just to save £100/$100 then I think you’re looking at it wrong. You shouldn’t buy this iPhone because it’s cheaper, you should buy it if you’ve been hankering for a smaller phone and are happy with the sacrifices that come with it. For most people, I still think the regular iPhone 12 is the best buy.

For the right person though, the iPhone 12 mini is unmatched and will be the phone they’ve been waiting for. There’s nothing else available that packs this amount of tech into a body so pocketable. Aside from battery life and screen size, you don’t lose anything here. It has the same chipset, same 5G and takes the same pictures as the bigger iPhone 12.
That means it comes with the same issues too: no charger in the box, no faster refresh rate display and the same notch that’s been intruding itself since the iPhone X.
With all the being said, the iPhone 12 mini is a strong device that will meet the specific needs of people who have felt left out by the rising size of iPhones. For that, Apple should be applauded and hopefully this isn’t a one off.

Verdict




























 



The Realme 7 Pro is a terrific all-round device that will delight those looking for a budget phone with decent photography and the freedom of fast-charging. The 7 Pro’s toughest competition ultimately comes from in-house, likely leaving Realme with smiles on their faces either way.



Pros

Strong all-round performance
Vibrant AMOLED display
Style on a budget
Decent photography abilities
65W charging



Cons

Lack of 90Hz
No 5G
Average fingerprint scanner

While many budget phones focus on giving you more premium specs at a reasonable price, the Realme 7 Pro is a bit more shallow – and it’s all the better for it. However, tough competition from other manufacturers, as well as in its own backyard, gives it an uphill battle.
Realme has been giving it some welly in the budget market recently, with the Realme X50 5G offering a smorgasbord of features at a budget price while the regular Realme 7 provides impressive gaming performance at a low price.
The Realme 7 Pro sits between these two devices, including some features of each phone while dropping some others. It’s clear Realme’s aim is to cater for a range of users rather than simply provide basic gradual spec bumps as its prices rise. Has the Realme 7 Pro nailed its spec sheet for its desired user base?

Screen and design – AMOLED ace
Recently, budget phones have done a great job at squeezing high refresh rate displays into their phones. The Realme 7 Pro takes a different approach.
Unlike its 120Hz Realme X50 5G and 90Hz Realme 7 brethren, the Realme 7 Pro sticks to 60Hz. The reduction may cause onlookers to initially turn up their noses at the supposed “Pro” model, however, there’s a key difference – AMOLED.

The Realme 7 Pro display, unlike the other aforementioned Realme phones, uses an AMOLED panel rather than LCD and the results are immediately obvious. You get deeper blacks and colour across the board is more vibrant than LCD alternatives, while viewing angles are improved too.
The lower refresh rate means scrolling isn’t as smooth and gamers may not love this panel but, for media viewing, the Realme 7 Pro is a winner – especially at its low price.

In the design department, the Realme 7 Pro is almost identical to the Realme 7 – and that’s no bad thing. Both phones give off the impression of phones around double or, even, triple the price. Unfortunately, the illusion is somewhat shattered by the plastic back but, in use, it’s pleasing to hold and looks perfectly stylish.
The bezels of the 7 Pro aren’t razer-thin but they are also far from egregious, while the Mirror Blue and Mirror Silver colours are inoffensive – if a tad bland.
Related: Best cheap phones
Performance – Nails the basics
The Snapdragon 720G chip in the Realme 7 Pro puts the sword to the phones that shell out for Snapdragon’s flagship processors and even the hugely popular mid-range Snapdragon 765G.
Admittedly, the Realme 7 Pro doesn’t feel blazingly fast but it also doesn’t feel all that much slower than some flagships that cost 2-3 times as much. The comparison to Snapdragon 765G is a poignant one, offering negligible performance difference. Both the Realme 7 Pro and 765G-sporting devices take that little split second longer to ready apps than flagships but most users, especially at this price point, really won’t care.
The Realme 7 Pro offers similar gaming performance to its more gaming-focused sibling, the Realme 7, while beating it in day-to-day usage. You can play all the latest popular mobile gaming titles on high settings with no troubles. However, you are saddled with 60Hz here, even if the crisp AMOLED goes some way to alleviating that disappointment.
The in-display fingerprint scanner is something that does show some slowness, being far less snappy than the power button-integrated solution on the Realme 7. The delay isn’t all that irritating but may bother the speed-conscious.
On the speaker front, you get one of the best experiences at this price. As always, you’ll be able to get a better experience from a set of headphones – thankfully, you get a headphone jack here to help with that – however, the earpiece speaker and bottom speaker combo is mightily impressive.
There’s a lack of bass and some distortion at higher levels but, in regular use or the odd headphone-less session, you won’t be disappointed.

Camera – Realme 7 Pro offers quality snaps on a budget
While some cameras at this price are best forgotten about, the Realme 7 Pro is a step up and certainly there to be considered for photography fans on a budget.
First and foremost, the Realme 7 Pro is a great point-and-shoot device. Many budget phones try to solve sensors shortcomings in software and end up with unnatural results. Thankfully, Realme doesn’t have to. The 64-megapixel sensor does a stellar job in natural light, capturing detail, shadow and colour accurately across the whole image.

The zoom capabilities aren’t bad either, offering a delightful level of detail at 2x. However, you’ll probably want to avoid the phone’s max 5x zoom, as it’s pretty blurry in all scenarios.
Another folly for budget camera phones is superfluous additional sensors and, while the 7 Pro isn’t perfect in that regard, the ultra-wide lens certainly shouldn’t be ignored. It’s a handy camera for when you’re unable to adjust your position and/or just want that wider perspective. You do lose some sharpness and accuracy compared to the main sensor but it produces a perfectly acceptable image.

The portrait mode option is far less impressive for the capabilities of the main camera but it does a decent job, nonetheless. Portrait mode can be rough going at this price, with the focal point often over sharpened and the bokeh effect all over the shop. For the Realme, portrait mode does a solid job of enhancing the subject and accurately applying some bokeh around it. Unfortunately, the bokeh is a little weak and could be more intense to give the desired portrait effect.

While it can’t offer the capabilities of flagship phones when it comes to night mode, the 7 Pro certainly gives it a good whack. The night mode isn’t overbearing on software tweaks. Instead, you get a image brightened slightly in most of the right areas with little compromise on detail.
Night mode is extended to video on the Realme too and it also does a good job of producing lighter results, even if it doesn’t (understandably) retain detail in the same way as the night mode photos. The general video abilities are not to be sniffed at either, with clips you won’t be ashamed to share online and a decent stability mode.
Battery life – Really good but not Realme good
The battery life of the Realme 7 Pro is decent enough and the 4500mAh cell will get you through the day. However, the battery performance is just okay when compared to some rivals at a similar price – including the Realme 7 and Moto G8 Power. Even the lower capacity-sporting Realme X50 5G seems to get more life out of its battery than the Pro.
Nevertheless, those used to a day of battery won’t be let down here but heavy-users or those who want to go beyond a single day have several options elsewhere.

One thing that lessens the blow of the only okay battery life is the stunning 65W SuperDart charging. Realme touts you can get 100% battery from 0% in just 34 minutes – and it’s claims are completely true. The superfast charging means you’re never left in a panic and can easily whack your phone on charge for even just 5-10 minutes to get a decent boost.

Should you buy the Realme 7 Pro?
If you’ve taken an interest in Realme of late with its stellar new budget phones, the company is making it fairly easy to decide between its £200-£300 lineup. To put it simply, the Realme 7 is the gaming one, the Realme 7 Pro is the stylish, fast charging and photography one and the Realme X50 5G is the high performance, 5G and 120Hz one.
There’s a tad more too it but those are the key features that will play the biggest role in your decision alongside price.
Against competitors from other manufacturers, you are able to get things like battery life and a higher refresh rate display but none provide it in such a good-looking build that contends with devices twice the price.
The Realme 7 Pro is a terrific all-round device that will delight those looking for a budget phone with decent photography and the freedom of fast-charging. The 7 Pro’s toughest competition ultimately comes from in-house, likely leaving Realme with smiles on their faces either way.

Verdict
































The Nokia 8.3 5G is HMD Global’s first attempt at a cheap phone with 5G. It targets the same busy space as the Pixel 5 and Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro.
As a piece of hardware it doesn’t have all the next generation bells and whistles seen on its competitors.
Check the phone’s specs sheet and you’ll find there’s no fast refresh rate screen or clever software additions to be found.
But, by getting nearly all the basics right and offering the blissfully bloatware free Android One experience, it remains a solid choice for any buyer on the budget looking for a 5G phone.

Design and Screen

A chunky, well-built phone
No 90Hz panel – something now fairly common at this price
6.81-inch is certainly large and good for media

Nokia execs’ used to joke that if you dropped one of their phones, it’s the floor that’ll come off worse. The Nokia 8.3 5G follows this strategy when it comes to design.
It’s a chunky, well built lump of a phone that’s noticeably larger and heavier than most current gen’ handsets measuring in at 171.9 x 78.6 x 9 mm and weighing 220g. The plastic, shiny back also gives it a distinct mid-range. Think Galaxy S20 FE, rather than flagship Galaxy S20 Ultra.
However, the heft makes it feel reassuringly solid, and having survived an accidental encounter with the kitchen flaw I can confirm it is very well built. As an added bonus, unlike many phones at this price it also has a formal IP 52 water resistance rating. This isn’t quite as good as an IP 68 rating, but it does add some protection from sprays of water.
The only downside to the phone’s heft is that, like the Moto G9 Plus and Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro, it can feel a little unwieldy to use one handed, especially if you’re a southpaw. This is in part due to its sheer size, but also because of its physical button placement.
Like its rivals, the Nokia places its power and volume controls on the phone’s right hand side. The positioning is intended to lie where a right handed person’s thumb would naturally fall, but for left handed people it’s an outright pain. This is especially true if you want to use the power buttons inbuilt fingerprint scanner.
Outside of this, it ticks all the right boxes when it comes to functionality, coming with either 64GB or 128GB of storage, a USB-C charge input and 3.5mm headphone input for any audiophile or wireless hold out still using a cabled set of cans.

The Nokia 8.3 5G’s screen is generally good, outside of one key omission – it doesn’t have a high refresh rate screen.
For those out of the know, traditionally most phone screens are locked to 60Hz. This means no matter what you’re doing the phone will render 60 images per second. However, recently phones have started hitting the market with higher refresh rate panels that can go as high as 90Hz, 120Hz and in some instances 144Hz. This has a few benefits, chief of which is making the display generally feel smoother to use and more responsive.
A few years ago the Nokia 8.3’s standard 60Hz rating would have been fine, but with key phones including the Pixel 5, Galaxy S20 FE, Moto G 5G Plus and Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro all featuring the tech it feels like an odd omission.
Thankfully outside of this the screen is perfectly serviceable. Measuring in at 6.81-inches big it’s more than spacious enough for regular use, movie watching and gaming. The 1080 x 2400 resolution isn’t the sharpest you’ll find this price, but honestly you’ll struggle to spot individual pixels.
IPS panels never offer the wonderful deep immersive blacks of their OLED rivals, but the Nokia 8.3’s screen has a nice neutral, natural tone, which is a welcome change to the overcooked warm displays I see on most phones this price.
Max brightness levels aren’t as good as you’ll find on some of the best Android phones, but they’re high enough to make sure the phone screen remains legible in everything but the brightest sunlight.

Performance

Android One gets you a clean build of Android with no bloatware
6GB or 8GB RAM and a Snapdragon 765G chipset
5G support

If, like us at Trusted Towers, you’re a fan of unadulterated, pristine clean Android installs then the Nokia 8.3 5G is a top phone. The 8.3 5G is one of a select few phones to come out this year as part of the Android One programme.
This comes with two key benefits. First, the phone’s software is untouched, meaning its completely free of bloatware, duplicate apps and UI changes. Second, because it ensures the phone will receive updates to newer versions of Android year-on-year, a key factor most companies struggle to deliver on at this price.
As a result, outside of Google’s Pixel line or Motorola’s One series, you’ll struggle to find a handset with cleaner, more future proof software than the Nokia 8.3 5G at the moment.
The Nokia 8.3 5G runs using Qualcomm’s mid-tier Snapdragon 765G chip. The chip’s backed up by either 6GB or 8GB of RAM (tested) depending on which storage option you pick.
Spec fanatics will likely sniff at the absence of an 8-series chip but, as we noted in our Pixel 5 review, the 765G is a perfectly competent piece of silicon that is more than powerful enough for most users. It’s also a lot less demanding on a phone’s battery.
With regular use I found the Nokia 8.3 5G zips through everyday tasks. Multi-tab web browsing is smooth and the phone runs game streaming services, like GeForce Now with zero issues. Local games like CoD Mobile and PUBG also run fine, though I tended to dial down their graphics settings to remain the occasional delay in loading times.
The chip’s 5G connectivity will also be a boon for early adopters of the new tech. 5G’s a new networking standard/technology that’s rapidly rolling out across the UK and other territories. It offers huge increases in data speeds compared to 4G that let you do things like stream video in 4K and download entire TV series in minutes. Or at least that’s the idea.
The phone’s synthetic benchmark scores mirrored my real world findings. Testing the phone with Geekbench 4, which stress tests the CPU to give a rough gauge of overall performance the Nokia 8.3 5G ran in with 571 single-core and 1543 multi-core scores. These scores are par for the course for a phone running the 765G chipset. The Pixel 5, which uses the same chip, scored 600 single and 1623 multi in the same test.

Camera

You’ll find four cameras on the back, including a 64MP main camera
This is paired with a depth camera and 12MP ultrawide
Selfies are taken care of with a 24MP front camera

The one area best mid-range phones, outside of Pixels, struggle to compete with the best phone is camera tech. This remains the case with the Nokia 8.3 5G, which offers passable, but fairly by the numbers camera performance.
The phone comes loaded with a quad-sensor rear camera that combines 64MP wide, 12 MP, ultrawide, MP, macro and 2 MP depth parts. As is the case on most phones at this price, the latter two sensors are fairly useless and don’t have any real impact on image quality if you use the out of the box settings.
The auto mode is capable of taking decent photos for use on social media. Images are generally sharp and the camera app/shutter speeds and auto focus are nice and snappy. Images also don’t feel massively over-processed, which is a common problem on most phones at this price. But colours and dynamic range aren’t on a par with what you’ll get on a Pixel 5 and generally can look a little dull compared to some competitors.
Portrait shots, where the phone uses the multiple sensors to detect depth and add a bokeh effect, also aren’t the cleanest you’ll find at this price. Though they look fine on screen, blown up you’ll see some boundary issues where the subject and background are blurred. A bokeh effect is where the main subject of a photo is sharp, but the background is blurred.
Night time photography tells a similar story. Though it is possible to take usable snaps in low light, if you have steady hands, motion blur creeps in with even the slightest movement. Noise is also prone to creeping in and generally you won’t get the same quality shot as you would using a Pixel 5.
The 24 MP front camera tells a similar story. It’s more than good enough for taking selfies in the daylight and video calls, but low light performance isn’t anything to write home about.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the Nokia 8.3 5G below.


 
Battery life

There’s a 4500mAh cell inside
18w charging

The Nokia 8.3 5G is powered by a 4500mAh battery and features 18W fast charging. With every day use it offers solid stamina. Using it as my main work and personal phone I universally managed to eke out around two day’s use before having to reach for the charger.
This entailed sporadically browsing the web, regularly checking my social media and incoming messages, watching a few Youtube videos, a few hours music listening and half an hour on GeForce Now before bed. The decent stamina is likely largely down to its clean software and basic 60Hz refresh rate screen. A higher refresh rate puts a bigger drain on a phone’s battery as it forces it to show more images per second.
However, intensive tasks hit it fairly hard. Watching video with the screen set to 150 nits, the brightness most people will find comfortable, on Wi-Fi the Nokia 8.3 5G discharged an average of 10% charge per hour, which is a little higher than normal.
Gaming puts an even bigger drain on the battery. Play PUBG the phone lost an average of 14% of its charge per hour.
Charge speeds are reasonably good with the phone generally taking just over an hour to go from 0-100% using the in box charger.
You should buy the Nokia 8.3 5G if…
You’re after good, clean software
Like many HMD Nokia phones, the Nokia 8.3 5G runs Android One software. This is a version of Android similar to what you’ll find on Pixel phones with a distinct lack of bloatware. You should also multiple updates and three years of security patches.
You shouldn’t buy the Nokia 8.3 5G if…
You want true value for money
At its RRP, this isn’t the best value smartphone out there and you can tell this phone was delayed a lot. The lack of a 90Hz display means you might want to look elsewhere to get better bang for your buck.
A great camera is key
Another aspect of this phone where you might find better in our best mid-range phone list is the camera. It’s perfectly adequate, just not the best around.

Verdict





























 



The 4a 5G is a mash-up of both the 4a and Pixel 5 and in many ways that makes it the hardest to recommend. It lacks some of the more ‘flagship’ features of the higher-end model and is missing the downright affordable price tag of the 4a. 



Pros

Great camera
Excellent software
Promise of updates



Cons

No 90Hz screen
Pixel 5 is only £100 more and worth it
Design is a little bland






Key Specifications

Review Price: £499
6.2-inch OLED display
Snapdragon 765G, 6GB RAM
12MP + 16MP cameras on the back
18w charging



The Google Pixel 4a 5G makes one thing clear the moment you take it out of the box: this is a phone that’s far closer to the Pixel 5 than the 4a, to the point it should probably be called the Pixel 5 Lite, and that’s certainly no bad thing.
This mid-priced device is the hardest of Google’s 2020 phone line-up to categorise. It packs the same dual camera and 5G-enabled chipset as the £599 Pixel 5, however it misses out on features like a 90hz display, metal frame, wireless charging and IP rating.
If those things are worth £100 to you (or $200) you’re probably better off with Google’s flagship. If they’re not, then the 4a 5G might be the phone for you. 
It’s also worth noting that Google is expected to launch the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro later this year. Check out our guides to discover what could be in store for the successor to the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5.

Design and screen – Slightly bigger, a lot more plasticky
As there’s no XL Pixel this year, the Pixel 4a 5G acts as the largest member of the Google phone family. Though only just. Here you’ve got a 6.2-inch display, whereas the regular 4a sports a 5.8-inch panel and the Pixel 5 comes in at 6-inches.
That 0.2-inches might not seem much, but the screen is notably bigger and the phone feels larger due to its thicker bezels.
Like the other Pixels, the screen is good. It’s an FHD+ OLED panel, with plenty of brightness, great colours and a small cutout in the corner for the front camera. It has HDR support too, which brings an extra pop to supported content.
What it is lacking though is a 90Hz refresh rate, which is a common feature now found at this price on Android phones from the likes of OnePlus, Motorola and Realme. A faster refresh rate (usually upping the standard 60Hz to 90Hz or 120Hz) gives you smoother scrolling and it’s a feature that’s hard to ditch once you’ve spent some time with it.

Having spent time with the Pixel 5 and its metal-clad body, the Pixel 4a 5G feels more plasticky and a lot more hollow in comparison. Still, it’s light and pocketable with a durable finish and a nice pop of colour on the power button.
Some other colours would be nice (there’s a black or white option in the USA, us Brits only get black) and there’s no denying the overall look is a little bland, but it still works in a simple sort of way.
You’ve got 3.5mm headphone port on the top, USB-C on the bottom and decent speakers that pump out loud audio.
Performance – More Pixel 5 than 4a
As the name suggests, this is a 5G phone – a feature not available on the cheaper Pixel 4a. It’s the cheapest Pixel with this next-gen connectivity tech and works as expected as long as you have a 5G SIM, contracts and are in a 5G area.
5G is certainly being touted heavily by networks, but I doubt many will notice the benefits yet – aside from higher numbers if you’re running speed tests. There’s a slightly pricier version available in the States with the ultra wideband mmWave form of 5G (this is faster, but contained into very small areas) however as that tech isn’t available in the UK we don’t require this version.
Powering the phone is the very capable Snapdragon 765G chipset, 6GB RAM (you get 8GB on the Pixel 5) and 128GB storage. You might not get true ‘flagship’ performance, but realistically for most people there’s enough grunt here to handle anything you throw at it. 
It handled every game I threw at it with ease and never lagged in general day-to-day use. If you’ve got a faster 8-series and open up apps at the same time then yes, the faster chip will nudge ahead. But for the price  you’re getting very good performance, and it isn’t bogged down by too many preinstalled apps. The deal is sweetened even more by the promise of multiple years of updates, something often missing from similarly-priced devices.
Camera – The Pixel 4a 5G takes excellent snaps
Like the chipset, the two rear cameras and the front selfie camera are the same across the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. That’s great, because the Pixel 5 camera is excellent – as you’d probably expect if you’ve ever previously used a Pixel phone or seen images from one. 
There are two sensors on the back, a 12MP main with an f/1,7 lens and an ultra wide 16MP companion. While there’s no dedicated zoom lens, Google said it has worked to recreate the 2x tele experience via software. That’s true to a point as the digital zoom is good but no match for an actual optical lens.
I’ve delved deep into the Pixel 4a 5G/Pixel 5 camera in our full in-depth Pixel 5 review so check that out for details on video improvements and lots of sample shots. But the short of it is that the Pixel 4a 5G takes excellent pictures, in all sorts of conditions and while it’s not a huge step up over the Pixel 4, for a phone at this price it’s unmatched.
The Pixel 4a 5G shines in both well lit and darker situations, with the HDR tech Google has been improving for years helping pull very contrast-heavy images. Colours are bright but still accurate, dynamic range is unmatched and the Night Mode manages to brighten even dark and dingey bar scenes. I like how the mode is now suggested when the light worsens, rather than forcing you to manually remember it’s there.
While last year’s Pixel 4 had a zoom camera, all the new models all ditch this for an ultra wide. This is handy for some striking landscapes, but in reality, I liked the versatility of the zoom and I think it’s missing here, just as it is on the cheaper iPhone 12 models. Shots from the ultra wide are good, though the sensor isn’t quite the same quality as the main.
Video here is notably better than on last year’s models. With 4K 60fps shooting and generally nicer colours and, to my eye, better stabilisation.

Battery life – Matching the standards set by the other Pixel 4a models
There’s a 3800mAh cell inside the 4a 5G and it comes with an 18w USB C PD charger in the box. While the battery is slightly smaller than most phones’ this size, endurance is on par with the Pixel 5 (which has to push a faster screen) meaning you’ll get through the day with about six hours of charge left. 
Throughout my time with the 4a 5G I haven’t had it die even with heavy use in a single day. Of course, I am working from home and my usage has changed a lot this year.
You do miss out on Qi wireless charging and reverse wireless charging – another benefit of paying a little more for the Pixel 5.

Should you buy the Pixel 4a 5G?
The 4a 5G is a mash-up of both the 4a and Pixel 5 and in many ways that makes it the hardest to recommend. It lacks some of the more ‘flagship’ features of the higher-end model and is missing the downright affordable price tag of the 4a. 
Still, for £499 you’re getting 5G and an excellent dual camera. There is a lot of competition around at this price though, with the excellent OnePlus Nord outpacing the 4a 5G in a number of areas for less. 
Then there’s the Pixel 5, which is £100 more and offers benefits like a better screen, wireless charging, metal body and an IP rating. It’s a tough choice, but if you can afford it I think the Pixel 5 is a better buy.

Verdict




























 



The Galaxy Note 20 will not be remembered as a high point for the Note series. It loses out on too many of the higher-end elements of Galaxy phones without a commensurate drop in cost.



Pros

Fun-to-use cameras
S-Pen is excellent for digital drawing
Powerful, even if it's beaten by the competition



Cons

Mediocre battery life
60Hz phone in a 90/120Hz world
Flat glass front, plastic back






Key Specifications

Review Price: £849
6.7-inches, OLED, 60Hz screen
Android 10
4300mAh battery
12MP dual pixel main, 64MP telephoto, 12MP ultrawide triple sensor rear camera
Snapdragon 865+ (North America and others) or Exynos 990 CPU



The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 is a lower-cost alternative to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It’s for people who want an S-Pen stylus but can’t stomach the very high price of the latter device.
However, given its plastic back, it’s hard to view this device as value-led. The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 is quite pricey for a phone with a plastic rear.
Its biggest issue is that the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 struggles to make it through a day of moderate use. We’ve reviewed the Exynos CPU model here; those thinking about buying the USA Snapdragon version may find it lasts longer.
Questionable value and relatively poor battery life are disappointing, then. But the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 is otherwise a pleasant phone featuring much of the functionality of other Samsung flagships, plus that excellent S-Pen stylus.
It may be important to note that Samsung recently released the Galaxy S21 and S21 Ultra and you’ll find these in our best phone and best Android phone lists.

Design – The plastic rear of the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 doesn’t impress
You have to wonder whether there were arguments aplenty among Samsung’s design team about the Galaxy Note 20’s most contentious parts. It has a plastic rear panel, rather than the curved glass back of other high-price Samsung handsets.
This is one of the most expensive plastic phones ever. Samsung has made it look great, of course, with a matte finish that could be mistaken for glass from afar. However, a few weeks in and the Galaxy Note 20 has picked up a few scuffs at its corners that likely wouldn’t be there if this were a piece of Gorilla Glass 6.
The previous Galaxy Note 10 also had a curved glass front. This one is flat, which is another way for Samsung to save some money in the Galaxy Note 20’s manufacture.

It’s a decent-looking phone, but not one made to the standards I expect at this price. The Galaxy Note 20 does at least come with IP68 water-resistance.
The handset features Samsung’s in-screen fingerprint scanner, too. This is an ultrasonic pad originally sold to us as an improvement on the optical tech used by other manufacturers. This isn’t the case, however; in use, it isn’t as fast as the best optical scanners, and still takes issue with wet thumbs. But in this generation it is at least comparable with the quicker pads.
The Galaxy Note 20 is missing a headphone jack, which is similar to almost all phones at the price. It does have a solid pair of stereo speakers, however, offering good volume and even a hint of bass.

S-Pen – Doodle and de-stress
All Galaxy Note 20 hardware extras seem inconsequential next to its S-Pen, this phone’s most important piece of technology. If you don’t care about it, you probably shouldn’t buy a Note.
This is a slim stylus that slots into the bottom of the phone. And it has a tiny battery that recharges in-situ, allowing for remote control-style gestures. You can use the pen as a music or camera controller.
Motion sensors also enable Air Actions, gestures that fire off when you hold the S-Pen’s button and waggle it in a certain way. These are customisable, and can load apps or act as fundamental navigation controls such as “back” or “home”.
I can’t imagine many Galaxy Note 20 users will use Air Actions or the remote controls too often, but the S-Pen’s job as a stress-dissolving doodling accessory seems more vital than ever. It’s an excellent little drawing tool, with pressure sensitivity and a feel that isn’t too dissimilar to using a graphics tablet.

A simple Samsung app called Pen Up comes pre-installed, but if you’d like to create more complex layered artworks then you’ll find plenty of options on Google Play. Apps such as Autodesk Sketchbook and Adobe Photoshop Sketch make use the of S-Pen’s 4,096-level pressure sensitivity.
Note that the Galaxy Note 20’s stylus isn’t quite as reactive as that of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, with 26ms latency instead of 9ms. However, unless you draw in an app/on an image that actually starts straining the phone, the pen line is able to track the S-Pen nib fairly well.
Display – Excellent colour performance, but the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 screen could be brighter
This slower latency is largely down to the difference in the Samsung Galaxy Note 20’s display tech – which, once again, doesn’t live up to what you might expect at the price.
It’s a 60Hz OLED screen, at a time when other phone makers are including 90Hz and 120Hz panels into much cheaper mobiles.
Side-by-side the difference in scrolling smoothness between the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra is obvious, in part because OLED’s fast-reacting pixels are the best showcase for a high refresh rate. The Galaxy Note 20’s 60Hz refresh rate doesn’t offer the same level of smoothness.
This isn’t a bad screen, just one that looks similar to those included on previous Note phones.

It supports HDR, and has the colour performance you’d hope for from a top-end Samsung. There’s a “Natural” mode that appears to adhere to the sRGB gamut. This will appear undersaturated next to most phones, but lets you appreciate the difference between truly vivid and pastel-like tones.
The Galaxy Note 20’s Vivid mode is super-saturated, and likely either uses the full colour whack of the display panel or is calibrated to Adobe RGB. We’re offered two extremes, which is the reason I wish there was a mode in-between. Samsung used to provide a greater number of display modes; and DCI-P3 is arguably a better mid-point fit for saturation and taste. It’s what Apple aims for in its iPhones at present.
Resolution isn’t super-high either at 2400 x 1080 pixels. The Note 10 had the same resolution, but it’s easier to notice fizz if you look close at small text on this larger screen. Still, it isn’t obvious.
Maximum brightness lags behind that of the Note 20 Ultra, too. On a bright day it will reach around 608cd/m, which is only half the power of Samsung’s best. It’s enough to make using the phone outdoors comfortable, and beats the 450cd/m of mid-range phones. But it doesn’t come close to the OnePlus 8T, for example, which reaches around 1100cd/m.
Performance and software – Move over Google Assistant, say hello to Bixby
The Galaxy Note 20 runs Android 10 with Samsung’s usual UI layered on top. This both looks and feels great, despite a few recent substantive changes.
It strays more from the default Google style than most. Samsung One UI replaces Google Assistant features with those of Bixby – that’s Samsung’s digital assistant – and has app menu pages instead of a scroll. But you’ll likely find your way into its groove pretty quickly, even if this is your first Samsung phone.
The Galaxy Note 20 is home to the Exynos 990 processor, supported by 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. However, the US version is a step up, running a Snapdragon 865+processor, which has a better GPU and superior power efficiency.

This version scores 2755 points in Geekbench 5 , significantly less than the 3250-3350 you might see from a Snapdragon 865 or 865+ phone. And lower still than the 3900 of an iPhone 12.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 does have enough power to satisfy, however. It feels quick day-to-day, with demanding games running just fine. However, it isn’t quite true to say there’s nothing to make use of more power, especially in reference to the GPU.
Fortnite runs at 60fps (many phones are limited to 30fps), but some frame rate drops are evident and GPU usage often reaches 90-100%. ARK: Survival Evolved often tips over to 100% usage, even though it’s limited to 30fps.
The most obvious slow-down moments in both titles weren’t actually as a result of the GPU maxing out, suggesting they are caused by something else such as loading textures. But today’s games, at capped frame rates, will still use all the power on offer here.
A Samsung Galaxy Note 20 is “powerful enough” then, but far from the most powerful at the price. You might notice the difference more in a year or two.

Camera – The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 takes decent pictures in daylight and at night
The Galaxy Note 20 has a triple camera lens array on its rear. There’s a 12-megapixel primary camera, a 64-megapixel zoom and a 12-megapixel wide unit.
It takes lovely day-lit images, with Samsung’s usual imaging approach. Skies will often look too blue; grass will often look too green – but it usually results in very striking images. Sunsets often look closer to what you’d want them to look like; phones tend to struggle to really bring out those rich orange and red tones with the right intensity.

The Galaxy Note 20’s default zoom range is 3x, but the phone doesn’t actually have a 3x zoom camera. Its 64-megapixel camera has just a slightly narrower field of view than the main camera, but uses its higher resolution to bring out more detail.
It switches to this secondary camera at 2x when you use the fine-grain zoom controls.
Images at 3x look good, but you don’t get the zoom power of the Note 20 Ultra, which takes decent 10x images. You’re best off sticking to 3x here. Digital zoom goes all the way to 30x, but these images look soft.
The Galaxy Note 20 performs well at night, holding on to more texture detail than most phone cameras. However, it isn’t the best at handling ultra low-light scenes, where the phone is left to create an image that looks near-black to the naked eye. This is only an issue if you like to push the hardware and take an almost counterintuitive approach to your photography, though.
 
The Note 20 tends to make blue skies bluer than they actually appear

Sometimes a more powerful zoom than the Note 20’s would come in handy
You can shoot video at up to 8K resolution, but I’d advise sticking to 4K/30 or 4K/60. Stabilisation and motion quality is better in these modes and the highest resolution setting uses the “zoom” camera rather than the primary. That said, getting any form of stabilisation at 8K resolution is impressive.
The Galaxy Note 20 also has a Super Steady mode, which uses the wide camera for boosted electronic stabilisation. I was impressed when this feature appeared in early 2019, but it has now been surpassed.
Super Steady is limited to 1080p and there’s a big hit to general image quality. Handsets such as the Oppo Find X2 Pro and Vivo X51 5G pull off this “GoPro stabilisation in a phone” concept better.
Battery life – Top up if you want it to last the day
The Galaxy Note 20 has a 4300mAh battery, which is relatively small for a phone with a 6.7-inch screen. Samsung’s S-Pen likely has some impact here, taking up internal space, as the Galaxy S20+ has a slightly larger 4500mAh cell.
Its real-world longevity disappoints. I have often needed to top up the Galaxy Note 20 to ensure it lasts until bedtime. And on lighter days, I’m rarely left with much battery life at all by the end of the day.
This is a side-effect of the Galaxy Note 20’s Exynos processor. Samsung’s top processors aren’t as power-efficient as those of the more popular Qualcomm Snapdragon range.
Battery life is the Note 20’s biggest issue. It makes the phone seem to demand quite a lot of maintenance, particularly if you tend to idly browse sites, social networks or eBay on the sofa.
Samsung doesn’t lead the way for charging speed, either. The Galaxy Note 20 supports 25W charging, which gets the phone from 0% to 39% in 30 minutes. This is much slower than the OnePlus 8T, for example.
You do get wireless charging and reverse wireless charging, but a pad will only charge at 15W, so wired is still the way forward for top-ups.

Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 20?
The Galaxy Note 20 will not be remembered as a high point for the Note series. It loses out on too many of the higher-end elements of Galaxy phones without a commensurate drop in cost. The phone’s back is plastic, the screen is flat rather than curved, and screen refresh is 60Hz when devices costing just a fraction of the Note 20 now come with high refresh rate screens. Add to this the below average battery life.
There’s still plenty for the lighter user to appreciate. The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 has enough power to run high-end games well, and includes a great set of cameras and the brilliant S-Pen.
So despite the fact that the Note-series’ charm remains, consider the design cuts and short battery life before you buy.

Verdict



































The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro is the latest flagship phone aiming to conquer the growing mid-range, £400-£600, market.
With stiff competition from some of the best Android phones like the OnePlus 8T, iPhone SE 2, Pixel 5 and Galaxy S20 FE, you may justifiably wonder why you’d opt for the Mi 10T Pro. But, thanks to a clever trick by Xiaomi, there is one key reason: A variable refresh rate 144Hz screen. The display makes it an on paper dream for media consumption and gaming.
If that sounds tempting, it should. This is a key trick that’s until now was limited to the uber expensive Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Having thoroughly put the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro through its paces, we can confirm the screen refresh rate is awesome and the device is a stellar value mid-ranger that’ll deliver on most users’ needs.
Niggling issues with the design and cameras stop it from being THE best phone you can get at this price, however.

Design and Screen

Little innovation in terms of design
Minimal bezel surrounding the display
No IP rating

Even the best mid-range phones always come with a few design compromises. This remains the case with the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro, which does very little to innovate from a design perspective.
It’s a chunky beast of a phone featuring a Gorilla Glass 5 front with a hole punch front camera, metallic sides and an unassuming flat grey plastic back that’s free of any design flourishes, outside of a sizable rear camera housing which protrudes a good few millimeters out.
The lack of an IP water resistance rating and side facing fingerprint scanner embedded in the phone’s power button further emphasise the Mi 10T Pro’s place as a mid-range handset.
So far so dull? For the most part I’d agree and concede the Mi 10T Pro feels fairly middle of the road. But, this is an issue we have with pretty much every phone this price and the lack of visual flair is forgivable as Xiaomi has for the most part done a great job cramming the Mi 10T Pro with top notch hardware.
Under the hood you’ll find the latest generation Snapdragon 865 chipset, alongside 8GB LPDDR5 RAM running the show, which also makes the Xiaomi 5G capable. During testing we found the combo was super fast and are yet to find a process/app the Mi 10T Pro can’t handle.
Build quality is also top notch, despite the phone’s lack of any formal water resistance. The phone feels suitably sturdy and easily survived an accidental encounter with a hardwood floor after an enraged toddler got hold of it.
The only semi-serious issue I have with the design is that it’s thickness and heft, coupled with the placement of its right hand volume and power inputs will make it feel a little unwieldy to use for people with smaller hands.

The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro’s screen is its most interesting feature. It packs a 6.67-inch IPS LCD, 2,400 x 1,080 resolution screen, that at first glance isn’t anything to write home about. OLED has been a common sight at this end of the market for quite some time and the 1080p resolution means it’s far from the sharpest you can get at this price. But with real world testing I still found it an absolute pleasure to use, especially when gaming or watching movies.
The biggest reason for this is the 144Hz refresh rate. This means compatible games are super smooth and, coupled with the screen’s high polling rate, you can enjoy responsive, post 60fps gaming on the go with the Mi 10T Pro. Over the last two week’s the device has become my mobile console of choice running streaming services like GeForce Now.
But it differentiates itself from most of its competitors by offering a variable experience. This lets the Mi 10T Pro’s screen optimise its refresh rate to match whatever process you’re running. So if you’re gaming and want a super fast refresh rate it’ll crank itself to 144Hz. But, if there’s no benefit, like when you’re watching Netflix content which runs at a lower rate, it’ll drop down to 30Hz to save power. It’s a neat trick I wish more phones would learn.
Outside of this, the screen also delivers in nearly all the right areas when it comes to general quality, despite being IPS, not OLED. During testing I didn’t see the screen hit the quoted 650 nits max brightness, but it was still wonderfully bright, and offered excellent viewing angles. Black levels aren’t as deep as what you’ll get on an OLED panel, but coupled with the screen’s solid brightness they ensured HDR10 content was suitably impactful and featured key details missing on cheaper LCD panels, such as the one I recently tested on the Moto G9 Plus.
Colours are also reasonably balanced, though the screen does appear a little warm to the naked eye. All-in-all the screen is a top performer that will meet most users’ needs.

Software
The Mi 10T Pro runs Android 10 with MIUI 12. The primary is great, but I’ve never been the biggest fan of any Android skin. This is because most skins make a few cardinal sins, the biggest being the addition of superfluous duplicate apps, pointless UI changes and delays upgrading to new versions of Google’s OS.
As skins go MIUI 12 isn’t the worst. Like Huawei’s EMUI the main changes it makes aren’t completely terrible, but they’re also not great. Icons for Android services have been left alone for the most part and the menu screens remain close enough to the OS’ original system to be intuitive. The only decision I’m not completely sold on is the removal of the app tray, though that’s more down to my personal taste than anything else.

Camera

There’s a main 108MP camera on the back
Lacks the zoom skills of the Mi 10

When it comes to camera tech the Mi 10T Pro has some serious competition thanks to the recent arrival of the Pixel 5, which is one of the best camera phones around for the money.
The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro’s rear camera setup is competent, but not best in class, as a result. Round back you’ll find a 108MP main sensor that’s paired with a 5MP macro and a 13MP ultra wide. Up front there’s a 20MP selfie camera.
The setup is fairly by the numbers for a phone at this price. The 108MP main snapper is good enough to take decent quality snaps for sharing on social media in regular light after they’ve been binned down to 22MP. Focus and shutter speeds feel snappy and colours look wonderfully accurate and are free of the overprocessed look you’ll find on many other mobile snappers this price.
The Mi 10T Pro does struggle in low light, however. Shooting in dim conditions details are lost and the lack of any depth sensor to back up the main sensor becomes apparent fairly quickly, especially when shooting portraits. Noise creeps in as well on occasion, marking the biggest difference in performance between the Xiaomi and its main mobile rival, the Pixel 5.
I’m also not sold on the secondary and tertiary sensors, which for the most part feel like afterthoughts and don’t deliver anywhere near as good quality, even when used in their specialist settings, as the main sensor.
The selfie camera is very capable in regular light. Images come out sharp, and are more than good enough for basic use, or to chronicle your lockdown life. Low light performance does rapidly degrade, but that’s standard on most phones and more than forgivable.
You can see a series of images taken on the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro below.
    
Battery life 

Hefty 5000mAh battery inside
33w wired charging

The Xiaomi MI 10T Pro should have a very good battery life, being powered by a giant 5000mAh cell and featuring an energy saving variable refresh rate.
With real world use the phone generally delivers solid battery life. Using the Xiaomi as my main phone with the screen set to the top 144Hz setting I generally managed to get around two days use out of the handset.
Unplugging it at 8.00am, listening to music throughout the day, sporadically web browsing, plus a couple of hours of movie and game streaming the phone would generally have over half its charge left at the end of the day.
The variable refresh rate also came to its own during testing when I battery drained it. Streaming Netflix the phone lost an average of 3-4% battery per hour, which is one of the best scores I’ve detected this year. Equally, gaming put a huge drain as the phone raced to render 144 images per second. Here the phone lost an average of 12-16% of its charge per hour.
Charge speeds are solid. The phone comes with a 33W charger in the box that generally fully charged the phone in just under an hour during testing.

You should buy it if…
You want reliable internals
Xiaomi doesn’t skimp on the internals here, which is great considering this more of a mid-range phone in terms of price. You’ve got the 865 flagship chipset from Qualcomm, 5G support, good charging speeds and plenty of RAM.
You want a fast screen
It might not be an OLED panel, but the 144Hz LCD panel here among the fastest out there and is great if you’re a gamer.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want a water resistant phone
One of the few missing features here is the lack of an IP rating, meaning there’s no official water resistance here.

Verdict





























 



Realme 7 is the best budget device for mobile gamers. While the top spec price may sail dangerously close to stronger rivals, the cheaper options have few equals in the budget department – especially in design and gaming performance.



Pros

Impressive gaming performance
Bright 90Hz display
Stunning value for money
Strong battery life
Fast fingerprint sensor
30W charging



Cons

Average day-to-day performance
Not for camera lovers
Poor speaker
Only 4GB RAM on base model






Key Specifications

6.5-inch FHD+ 90Hz display
MediaTek Helio G95 processor
Up to 8GB RAM and 128GB storage
48MP main camera, 8MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro and 2MP portrait
16MP selfie camera
30W charging, 5000mAh battery



Take a step back and the Realme 7 looks like some devices that are between 2 to 3 times the price. Has Realme 7 cut the right corners to make this budget Android phone a winner?
Realme recently revealed its new 7 series – including the Realme 7 and Realme 7 Pro.  The range is laser targeted at giving users the most premium experience possible as low-low price.
The Realme 7 Pro might have a more difficult time, potentially priced too close to the already outstanding Realme X50 5G phone. While the Realme 7 is priced so low that if it can pull off its impressive spec sheet, it might be the budget phone to buy.

Realme 7 screen and design – Budget brilliance
Realme 7 comfortably sits among the best-looking phones you can get for under £300 – easily surpassing similarly priced rivals like the Moto G8 and Oppo A5 2020.
The display comfortably beats rivals too – with a FHD+ panel when some competitors stick to 720p. The resolution might already chalk the win up to the Realme but you also get one of the cheapest 90Hz phones you can buy. If you don’t want to fork out much more than £200 for a phone but are gutted to have to miss out on a high refresh rate then the Realme 7 has you covered.

There’s no dirty secret hidden behind the spec sheet here either. The FHD+ 90Hz LCD panel is sharp, surprisingly vibrant and smooth when scrolling – it truly is a remarkable sight on such a low priced phone.
You won’t find any cut corners in the design department. The Realme 7 offers looks extremely similar to Android phones that can cost upwards of £600. The bezels are relatively thin and the rest design stands out without being garish.

You will notice the price difference when it comes to touch, as the rear is undeniably plastic. However, the smooth plastic feels great in the hand and rebuffs fingerprints.
Speaking of fingerprints, here you get a fingerprint scanner embedded into the power button. As is the story with much of Realme’s budget phone, the scanner is speedy and just works like a dream – surpassing the performance you’d expect for such a low priced device.

Performance – Gaming goodness
Realme doesn’t quite perform the miracles it does with the design in the performance department – but it isn’t all bad.
For the most part, you can move from messaging app to browser to social media app without any worries. However, you can notice that momentary wait for apps to open compared to mid-range and above devices.
You’ll also notice slow down with this phone if you try to quickly move between more demanding apps – like productivity tools, photo editors or games.
My experience of reviewing this device also came via the £239 8GB RAM model, so expect further reduced multitasking performance with the £179 4GB RAM and £199 6GB RAM devices. Nevertheless, the performance remains impressive for a device around £200 and offers much the same as rivals.
Where the Realme 7 and its MediaTek Helio G95 gaming chip does stand out is in – you guessed it – gaming. While the regular performance falls in line with the competition, gaming is a cut above.
The experience is more akin to a mid-range device, playing all your favourite mobile titles like Call of Duty Mobile and PUBG Mobile on higher settings  without blinking. Realme 7 achieving higher settings means games take advantage of that 90Hz refresh rate and it’s with games that it truly shines. This is the budget phone for gamers.
Camera – Photographers be warned
If you are a frequent photo taker, this new Realme phone is not for you – even at this attractive price.
The point-and-shoot capability of this phone is just not good. Even to an untrained eye, you’ll immediately spot the aggressive oversharpening of images.

For other features, things don’t get much better. The Realme can manage up to 10x zoom but you won’t want to go beyond 2x for a half-decent photo.
The Portrait mode is all over the place with the focal point sharpened even more so and the bokeh effect whacked on in a fairly random-looking manner.

Out of the extra modes, Night mode is the best of a bad bunch – doing an acceptable job of simply raising the brightness of the overall image and not overdoing on software tweaks like the phone’s other modes.
Related: Android 11
Battery life – 5000mAh joy
The main event of this phone’s battery chops is unquestionably the battery’s mammoth size, however, the charging isn’t to be ignored either.
It isn’t quite the 65W SuperDart charging on the Realme 7 Pro but 30W Dart charging will be plenty for most – filling up that chunky 5000mAh battery to a full charge in under an hour.

The 5000mAh leads to as an impressive length of battery life as you might expect – especially given the less horsepower hungry nature of a budget device. The length battery life can stretch to two days under lighter use but, on your average day-to-day, you’ll probably need to top up about half way through the second day – outperforming many modern devices that only offer a single day.

Should you buy the Realme 7?
Realme 7 performs some near-miracles for its price. You get gaming performance that keeps pace with devices that are double the price – and the same goes for design.
You will be sacrificing quite a lot when it comes to quality of photography while the screen and the phone’s multitasking performance is only average.
At this price, each device will come with plenty of shortcomings and, up against rivals like Moto G8 and Oppo A5 2020, the Realme 7 makes some shrewd choices – especially for gamers.
Realme 7 is the best budget device for mobile gamers. While the top spec price may sail dangerously close to stronger rivals, the cheaper options have few equals in the budget department – especially in design and gaming performance.

Verdict




























 



Oppo Reno 4 Pro has found itself at the wrong place at the wrong time. The new Oppo does everything it sets out to do, with ludicrously fast charging, snappy performance and a delightful main camera, but it’s price places it up against far too strong competition.



Pros

Impressive display
Premium design with brave colour options
Near flagship performance
Strong main camera, basic zoom and macro
Battery life and charging are top class



Cons

Above 5x zoom is poor
No wireless charging
No IP rating
Price hard to swallow versus rivals






Key Specifications

6.5-inch FHD+ AMOLED 90Hz
48MP main sensor, 12MP wide-angle, 13MP telephoto
32MP punch hole selfie camera
Snapdragon 765G
12GB RAM / 256GB storage
4000mAh battery



Oppo has had plenty of success this year already, with the impressive Find X2 Pro, and now it is back with the flagship device of its cheaper Reno range. Oppo Reno 4 Pro may have had a clear run at the upper mid-range market until just the past couple of weeks – with strong rivals from Google and Samsung, can it keep up?
Oppo can’t have been all too pleased to see the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and Google Pixel 5 drop right around the same time as its device that starts at a price of £100 more.
Nevertheless, Oppo has always done its own thing – finding success with the Find X2 Pro, even at what seemed like an exorbitant starting price. In particular, Oppo Reno 4 Pro is clearly a different beast to what’s offering by Samsung and Google, with a few key differentiators. Can the Reno 4 Pro stand out from the crowd or will it get drowned out by some of the big players?
Screen – Smooth and bright
The 90Hz refresh rate is certainly the stand out feature of the Oppo Reno 4 Pro display, making the day-to-day scrolling and navigation experience all the more pleasing. The smoothness extends to watching videos and gaming, where the display handles sharp movement with ease.

The FHD+ resolution combined with that higher refresh rate and AMOLED panel makes for a gorgeous display experience – in particular, the UI looks stunning – with a bright and vibrant colour range. The display can get extremely bright so you’ll never have issues seeing this display in direct sunlight.
Those who have experienced QHD (or, even, 4K) mobile panels may find the display somewhat wanting when watching video, as the large 6.55-inch panel can lack a little detail.
Design – Smudges dent the style
The Oppo Reno 4 Pro continues the long-running trend of glass sandwich design that you’ll be familiar with if you’ve ever owned a flagship Samsung Galaxy device. As such, the make up of the hardware doesn’t really stand out even if it remains fairly stylish in its own right.

The colour choices are where Oppo is really aiming to stand out with its latest phone, opting for two quite different directions. There’s the interesting Galactic Blue, which Oppo says is “silky to the touch” and is also fingerprint-proof – the bright light blue shade is certainly to grab many fans.
Whereas, our review model is Space Black. The black colour offers a slight rainbow reflection when caught by the light and has Oppo logos smattered across the bottom half of the device. One thing it certainly isn’t is fingerprint-proof, I’ve experienced prints and smudges aplenty.
Performance – A day-to-day dream
Like other devices we’ve reviewed sporting the new Snapdragon 765G chip, the Oppo Reno 4 Pro offers nigh-on flagship performance along with the handy new 5G connectivity tech.
Reno 4 Pro handles all games like a dream – and that 90Hz display only adds to the seamless experience. With 12GB RAM, all of your day-to-day tasks – from browsing to messaging and video watching – won’t trouble this device. To push this device, you have to go out of your way to push it – with swift multi-tasking of the most demanding applications.
The new Oppo comes in a singular model that offers 256GB storage, which is a nice coup over some competitors that kick off with just 128GB.

On the software side, Color OS 7.2 (Android 10) isn’t all that intrusive – offering a fairly simple take on Android. A stand out feature for those with 6.5-inch display averse hands is “Icon pull-down gesture” – a one-handed mode of sorts that lets you drag up from the bottom left or right to have your apps pulled towards you for easier use.
Some of the Oppo hardware features on the periphery perform less well. The fingerprint scanner works perfectly fine in terms of accuracy but it is far less speedy than physical fingerprint buttons or face unlock-sporting devices.
The speakers aren’t going to be doing much justice to your favourite music. The stereo setup is fine for calls and watching most videos but it is far from a premium audio experience.
Camera – Boosted basics, awkward add-ons
The day-to-day camera experience of the Reno 4 Pro is more than enough for your average phone user but there are certainly some features that could use a little TLC.

The main camera is able to take some stunning snaps in a variety of situations, capturing plenty of detail and clear colours amongst buildings or out in the wild. This phone is a great point and shoot device.

However, an extra level of scrutiny may leave camera aficionados looking elsewhere. Oppo is doing a lot with its AI capabilities and little adjustments of camera positioning can often lead to very different photos. You can really tell when a photo has been “enhanced” and it hurts the realism of the image – making darker aspects of the image a bit too well lit and obscuring detail.
This tinkering affects your use of Night Mode too. In low light situations, you’ll often get better results by just using the camera as normal and letting Oppo’s AI do its thing. While actually putting the phone in Night Mode leads to an overly bright and unrealistic image.

The additional features are a mixed bag. Oppo avoids the trap of including a lacklustre macro camera, like many other Android phones at the moment. Macro shots are still not great but at least a sensor hasn’t been wasted on it. Any kind of “super” zoom is off the table, with anything above 5x zoom really not worth capturing.
While the Portrait mode offering is quite impressive, with subjects clearly defined without any awkward misplaced blurring.

Oppo is keen to boast about its “Ultra Steady” modes on both its rear and front-facing camera – and they do achieve what it says on the tin. Turn the mode on and you’ll get much improved results, especially if you are videoing a subject, but it isn’t a breathtaking implementation of this feature and most other phones also do a decent job.
Battery life – Va Va Vooc
Oppo Reno 4 Pro battery capabilities are something of a marvel – with a stellar combo of long-lasting battery life and unbelievably fast-charging.
Like Realme. Oppo has started using 65W fast charging (SuperVooc, as it’s named by Oppo) and it is something to behold. Oppo touts you can charge the device up to 60% in just 15 minutes and 100% in 36 minutes. Our experience was about five minutes longer in both cases but it’s still mighty quick. The charger and phone can get slightly warm to the touch but it is far from an unnerving level.
While super-fast charging is great and all, you won’t be constantly reaching for it with the Reno 4 Pro. The 4000 mAh battery manages to get you to the end of the day without that evening stretching act before bedtime. I was able to get through a day with about 7 hours screen-on time and have around 10% still in reserve.
For those rare times you are scrambling, Oppo offers Super Power Saving Mode. The mode restricts you to just six apps and lets you eke another hour or so if you hit the 5% mark.
Should you buy the Oppo Reno 4 Pro?
Oppo Reno 4 Pro doesn’t offer many stand out faults, once again making a strong argument for not buying a £1000 phone. However, the Reno 4 Pro would’ve been far more appealing about six months ago and it can’t quite compete with some of the best cheap phones and best mid-range phones.
Now, the new Oppo has a cheaper Pixel 5 with similar specs to contend with along with similarly priced devices OnePlus 8T and Samsung Galaxy S20 FE that offer more for your money.
As a result, the impressive screen, decent performance and strong camera capabilities aren’t enough to opt for the Oppo over the extremely similar OnePlus 8T – unless the Reno 4 Pro design is something that greatly appeals.
Oppo Reno 4 Pro has found itself at the wrong place at the wrong time. The new Oppo does everything it sets out to do, with ludicrously fast charging, snappy performance and a delightful main camera, but it’s price places it up against far too strong competition.

Verdict




























 



The Moto G9 Plus is for the most part an amazing value phablet. But with Motorola having released the higher specced, more future proof Moto G 5G Plus mere weeks ago, it sits in an awkward position in the Western market.



Pros

Large screen
Decent build quality
Good battery life



Cons

Not the best value Moto G
Just buy the Moto G 5G Plus






Key Specifications

Review Price: £259.99
6.81-inch, IPS, 1080 x 2400 resolution, 20:9 aspect ratio screen

The Moto G9 Plus is one of the latest entries into Motorola’s iconic G-line of affordable smartphones. 
It aims to offer buyers on a top-notch smartphone ideally made for Netflix binges and general entertainment that won’t break the bank.
For the most part it lives up to the G-series heritage and is a great handset that will easily meet most people’s needs. But, its timing is outright terrible, with the arrival of the Moto G 5G Plus stealing nearly all its thunder by offering a few key flagship features missing on the regular G9. The biggest are the lack of a high refresh rate screen and 5G connectivity.
These factors make the Moto G 5G Plus a better for any buyer living in an active, or soon to be active, 5G zone, despite the fact the G9 Plus is still for the most part a decent affordable phone.
Related: Best cheap phones

Design – The Moto G9 Plus is not a subtle phone
The Moto G9 Plus is an unashamedly large device featuring a gigantic 6.81-inch display, 223g weight and slightly chunky, near 10mm thickness – and that’s without the included chunky rubberised case attached.
Despite this it still feels like a well made handset. It features a glass front and plastic unibody design, which feels surprisingly sturdy, despite not featuring a formal IP water resistance rating. This plus its small bezel and hole punch front camera housing help it feel significantly more premium than you’d expect from a sub-£300 phone.
The only slight downside is that the fingerprint sensor is built into the phone’s right facing physical power button. It’s accurate enough, but like all phones this size, the control’s placement can make it awkward to reach, especially for people with small hands. But this is a common compromise on a phone this price and size.
Connectivity is solid, with the phone featuring a USB C charge port, 3.5mm jack and microSD slot that makes it quick and easy to upgrade the Moto G9 Plus’ 128GB of in-built storage.
The addition of a left facing, dedicated Google Assistant button makes it quick and easy to access Android’s digital butler, which works well thanks to the G9’s reliable mic setup.

Screen – The Moto G9 Plus has an HDR-ready screen made for Netflix
Motorola’s marketing the G9 Plus “Max Vision” screen as one of the phone’s key selling points, and for the most part there’s good reason for this.
The FHD+ resolution panel supports the HDR10 standard, giving it an edge on many of the competing phones we test at this price. With real world use the screen is for the most part good enough for media consumption and general use.
Max brightness levels are solid and despite being an IPS panel, blacks are reasonably deep. The combo gives HDR compatible content on Netflix and Amazon a subtle pop, showing details that are lost on many competing cheaper phone screens. Though be warned the difference is nowhere near as noticeable as it is on competing mid-range handsets, like the Galaxy S20 FE. The screen’s size adds to the immersion level, as does its fairly forceful side speaker, which offers solid max volumes.
The peek display setting is a returning welcome touch. This is a cool feature that automatically offers a low power quick view of incoming notifications that turns on when you look at the screen.
Out of the box colours are overcooked and whites are a little out of whack, but a quick trip to the phone’s settings menu makes it easy to fix this, by switching the screen to the infinitely superior Natural display profile. Once done, colours are much more accurate, but still a little warm.
Even with this minor qualm, if you’d asked me a few months ago, I’d still have listed the screen as one of the best you’d find on an affordable phablet. But, the G9 Plus is now missing one key feature: 90Hz refresh rate support.
This is a key flagship that’s started trickling down to the affordable end of the market in recent months. It’s a key selling point of the G9’s 5G sibling that lets it render more images per second. The benefit of this, coupled with a higher screen polling rate, is that the phone feels more responsive and generally smoother to use.

Camera – You’ll struggle to do better at this price, but its not perfect
The G9’s camera setup is generally solid for a phone at this price and more than good enough for casual snappers.
Round the back you’ll find a quad camera array that couples an undisclosed 64MP main sensor, ultra-wide angle secondary, “Macro Vision” tertiary and depth sensor for portraits. The first two sensors do what they say on the tin while the latter two are being marketed as a means to radically improving the phone’s macro photography.
Personally I’d have preferred to see a telephoto lens included somewhere, but these are still a rarity on affordable phones so the absence is hardly a deal breaker, especially as the main sensor does a relatively decent job.
Images generally have decent contrast and good enough colour representation for sharing on social media. The only minor downside is that, despite having ok shutter speeds, the camera has a minor tendency to over-sharpen still shots and can struggle to capture quick takes without bur creeping in, though given the G9 Plus’ price that’s hardly surprising.
Low light performance is par for the course for a phone this price. Despite the camera’s f/1.8 aperture, without a tripod or incredibly steady hand aberrations and blurs will creep in, but it is possible to take usable shots for sharing among friends.
The wide-angle tells a similar story. Images are fine for sharing on Instagram, but zoomed in they generally lack detail compared to most mid-range, let alone flagship phones.
Like all phones, the less we say about macro performance the better. Unless your subject is staying very still, don’t expect great things.
The 16MP front camera is more than capable enough for selfies, in good light, and video calls.
You can see a selection of sample photos taken on the Moto G9 Plus below.

Performance – Solid, but there’s a key omission
The Moto G9 Plus is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G CPU. Motorola claims this makes it 57% more powerful and 20% more efficient than its predecessor, the Moto G8 Plus.
With real world use, I found the G9 Plus is more than fast enough for general use. The phone’s not as nippy as one featuring a more powerful 8-series Qualcomm chip, but unless you’re a serious power user you won’t have any issues with it. PUBG runs smoothly, as do most games from the Play Store. It does heat up during prolonged streaming sessions on GeForce Now, but not to the point I noticed throttling.
All in all, outside of it feeling a fraction of a second slower than a flagship, the G9’s performance is solid.
But, the use of the older 7-series chip, not the new 765 means it is missing the next generation connectivity offered by its moderately more expensive sibling, the Moto G 5G Plus.
If you’re in an area where the connectivity is still rare this won’t be an issue. But for those in 5G hubs, it is a key issue that will hinder the G9 Plus’ long term appeal.
5G is a new networking technology that outright smokes 4G when it comes to data connection speeds. It opens up the door to radical new ways to use your phone, including triple A game streaming on services like GeForce Now, Stadia and Project xCloud and the ability to download entire film series, in 4K in minutes.
Considering how rapidly the tech’s spreading across the UK and the negligible difference in price between the two Moto Gs, this is a key differentiator that makes the 5G model feel better value long term, despite it being a little more expensive.
The main selling point for any recent Motorola phone has been their software. Since the first generation Moto G launched many moons ago, Motorola has taken a sensible, light touch with all its phones software.

The Moto G9 Plus offers solid battery life, generally
The Moto G9 Plus packs a sizable 5000mAh batter that Motorola quotes as offering 147 hours of music, 19 hours of video or 14 hours of web browsing off a single charge. It also comes with the firm’s TurboPower 30 charger tech which in paper will offer users 12 hours of power from just 10 minutes at the mains.
With real world use I found it was easy enough to get between a day and a half to two days regular use out of the Moto G9 Plus. This entailed using it as my primary work and personal phone, taking and making calls throughout the day, a few Zoom meetings during office hours, sporadic music listening, a couple of games of PUBG Mobile and an hour’s Netflix before bed.
More intensive tasks do put a bigger drain on the battery however. Streaming video on Netflix the phone discharged an average of 6-8% of its charge per hour. Gaming put a heftier 12% drain on the battery per hour.
Charge rates are solid for a phone this size, with the handset generally taking around 1.4 hours to go from zero to 100%.

Should you buy the Moto G9 Plus?
If you’d asked us three months ago we’d have listed the Moto G9 Plus as one of the best value affordable phones on the market. But thanks to the arrival of stellar handsets from the likes of Redmi and Motorola’s own Moto G 5G Plus our expectations have changed.

As it stands this makes the Moto G9 Plus a solid performer in the affordable end of the market that will deliver on most users needs. But there are better value phones available for only a fraction more, like the Moto G 5G Plus.

Verdict


































For £599 (or $699) the Pixel 5 is a surprisingly excellent deal, especially for those who desire a smaller phone and put camera prowess over gaming performance. 



Pros
Typically fantastic Pixel cameraImproved video recording featuresFar better battery life than Pixel 4Small design is refreshingThe price is great

Cons
Design a little blandAn XL version would have been a nice optionCameras lack the versatility of some rivalsNo face unlock

Key Features
Review Price: £5996-inch FHD+ OLED display12MP + 16MP rear cameras4000mAh batteryIP68Qi charging


The Pixel 5 is the antidote to the £1000+ smartphone. Simple, functional and designed for people to use rather than just to look pretty.
It’s fair to say the Pixel 4 didn’t work. Even though it had a great camera, it fell short of its early promise due to awful battery life and an underutilised and forgettable radar system. A year later and Google’s latest flagship is about as different as it could be.
The soli radar chip and the gesture-controlled UI are gone, as is the Pixel 4’s flagship processor and big screen design. But most importantly, gone is that high-price. Meet the £599 Pixel 5. 
We’re expecting the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro to arrive this year, so make sure to visit our guides to find out what could be in store for the Pixel 5’s successor. 
Screen and Design – The small Android phone we’ve been waiting for
The Pixel line seems to redefine itself every year and with each iteration the changes always bring some sort of big issue. The Pixel 2 had a bad screen; Pixel 3 XL adopted the most egregious notch we’ve ever seen and Pixel 4 suffered from some of the worst battery life around. Google has tried to stop the trend continuing this year by pulling the Pixel 5 back, focusing on the basics and targeting a more mid-range billing.
This is still the flagship Google phone for 2020, however instead of taking on the iPhone 12, Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and Huawei Mate 40 it’s taking a more restrained approach.
Related: Pixel 5 vs Pixel 4

Pixel 5 is a simple phone. And nowhere is that more obvious than in its design. The black version I have is a little bland visually, without any design flair or unique touches. There’s a ‘Sorta Sage’ hue available too, which is a little more interesting. 
Actually pick up the phone though and things are far more positive. Unlike the Pixel 4a series, the Pixel 5 has an aluminium frame which gives it a tougher feel. This metal is then covered with a finely textured coating that is most comparable to thick paper. It feels great to hold and far more ‘premium’ than the Pixel 4a – even though they look very much the same in pictures. I do wish that the frame with a little tighter to the glass covering the display, as the small gap has already become a home for bits of dust to get stuck.
Related: Best Android phone
Where the Pixel 5 really sets itself apart from other Android phones is its size. This is a small phone – smaller than the Galaxy S20, OnePlus 8 and most others we’ve reviewed this year. It’s even smaller than the 6-inch display suggests, as Google has done what very few other Android phones have managed and slimmed the bezel all the way around the screen to a uniform tiny size. If you like the size of the smaller iPhone 11 Pro, you’ll like this.
I do have to admit the lack of an XL option is a shame, especially for media watching on the go and utilising the vast array of game streaming services. Still, there’s plenty of choices if you want a larger device and it’s nice to see Google focus on those who prefer something smaller.
Having reviewed mostly big phones this year, switching to the Pixel 5 was just a refreshing as when I first put my SIM inside the Pixel 4a. After getting used to the cramped keyboard, the comparatively tiny dimensions and lightweight (155g) body make this so easy to hold and use with one hand.
On the back there’s a shiny G logo, a camera array inside a square outline and a capacitive fingerprint scanner. This scanner is very fast and far more reliable than any in-display option, but it’s so flush with the back that it’s very easy to accidentally press. I had to turn off the option for it to bring down the notification tray with a swipe as I kept accidentally hitting it.
Even though there have been some sacrifices throughout the Pixel 5 to reach the appealing £599 ($699) price, it still remains an IP68 rated device. There’s no headphone jack though (you’ll still find that on the 4a and 4a 5G) and the buttons feel a bit plasticky.
Related: What is 5G?

The 6-inch screen itself is great. There’s a cutout for the front camera but it’s small-enough that content still feels immersive. It’s an OLED panel with a FHD+ resolution (not QHD+, but at this size that’s not an issue in the slightest) and support for HDR 10. It’s a bright, colour accurate panel that really shines. Covering the display is Gorilla Glass 6.
My only real issue is the annoying auto-brightness, which is too slow to catch up with the environment.
Setting the Pixel 5’s display apart from the 4a and 4a 5G is the option of a quicker 90Hz refresh rate rather than 60Hz. This can be toggled on and off and switches the refresh rate from 60Hz to 90hz depending on what you’re doing. The result is smoother scrolling and an extra feeling of speed.
Performance – Not quite flagship, but you probably won’t notice
There will no doubt be those who instantly discount the Pixel 5 for not possessing the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8-series chipset. For most people though this won’t be an issue, as the Pixel 5 still feels like a fast phone.
The Snapdragon 765G chipset used here is very capable and it’s been used in a load of phones this year, ranging from cheaper options to the £1000+ Moto Razr 5G. It’s not as fast in benchmarks as an 8-series chip and there is a little more lag when opening apps or gaming. However you’ll probably only notice these if you’re big into smartphone gaming (I’d suggest looking elsewhere) or putting it directly against something running a Snapdragon 865.
If switching to this chip allowed Google to spend the money elsewhere (wireless charging, an IP rated body, better camera optimisation) then it’s absolutely the right thing to do. I also applaud Google for going with 8GB RAM, when 6GB would probably have been fine. Switching between apps is smooth and they stay in memory for ages, meaning less reloads. A single 128GB storage option, with no expandability, could be a little more limiting to certain users. 
Another benefit of the 765G is that it’s compatible with a 5G modem, and like most phones this year the Pixel 5 is a 5G phone. If you’re in a 5G area, on a suitable plan and with a capable SIM (the likelihood is that your SIM is already 5G capable) then you will access the 5G data. 
If you’re in the US, the Pixel 5 version also packs the right antennas for mmWave 5G which is likely why it’s a little pricier than the UK. We have no use for mmWave here (yet) so it’s a smart move leaving that off and offering us a cheaper version.
5G isn’t, for me, a reason to buy a phone or upgrade a 4G phone yet – but it’s a ‘nice to have’. 
The speakers are fine and loud for such a small phone but far from fantastic; call quality is great with strong mics and there is NFC and Bluetooth 5. You are missing WiFi 6 though, which might annoy some who have just picked up a fancy new router.
Android 11 comes installed out-of-the-box with the same Pixel skin and launcher Google has used for a few years now. New features include a better battery saving mode that turns off a lot of functionality for far better endurance (ideal for camping or festivals), higher-quality Duo video calls and you’ll always be first with new Assistant features. 
The best software trick remains the Recorder app, which is the finest solution I have ever used for transcribing live audio. It works without an internet connection, can tell the difference between people, pets and even musical instruments and you can now share little tidbits of audio.

Some bits of Android 11 are a little annoying, though. Pushing the music controls into the quick settings menu is baffling and doesn’t even seem to work with every music apps (Audible, for example) making it confusing when you’re trying to pause. There’s also no face unlock option, an omission that’s particularly annoying as the rear-facing fingerprint scanner is impossible to hit with the phone on a table.
I do like the smart home and Google Pay actions embedded into a press of the power button, and the clean look is still superior to many of the third-party skins around. You’ll also get updates far faster than with other Android phones.
Camera – Small tweaks refine the Pixel formula even if it lacks the versatility of some rivals
The Pixel 5 camera is certainly more of a gentle step-forward than a giant leap. You still get great snaps in all sort of conditions, but now there’s an ultrawide camera rather than a 2x tele and improved video. 
A lot of new features come down to software, which is nothing new for a Pixel device. There aren’t too many differences with the hardware, with it retaining a 12MP f/1.7 main sensor.

During a briefing ahead of Pixel launch, Google reps said that the reason to ditch the tele camera was down to many of the benefits being able to be replicated via software – something you can’t do with an ultrawide.

If you’ve ever shot with a Pixel or really even seen an image from a Pixel phone then you’ll likely know the characteristics. Images are sharp, with realistic bright colours and great dynamic range. Things are the same here and the improvements to the HDR gets even more detail and nuance in faces. You can take your portrait shots up a shot too, as there’s some nice portrait lighting effects that alters the smooth bokeh behind your infocus subject. We’ve seen stuff like this before, but it’s still nice to have.
The camera is fast enough to capture fast movement
The dynamic range is great
What still gets me every time I take a shot with the Pixel 5 is the natual bokeh, something often missed on other phones. See the pictures of the flowers for instance and you can tell how nicely the background and the lights blur.
There’s a lovely natural blur
In tougher conditions, the Pixel 5 can still offer great results and the night mode – which now pops up automatically when the scene requires it – pulls out brightness you wouldn’t even was there. If you love taking shots at night then this is one of the best options out there.
Lo-wlight performance is great, especially in the colours
Where the Pixel can’t compete so much is in versatility. While it can software zoom, this is no match to the vastly superior tele sensors on the competition and it removes a string from the Pixels bow.
There some notable upgrades to video recording with the Pixel 5 and they are very much welcome. You can now shoot 4K 60 and there are multiple levels of stabilisation, including a dedicated mode for action shooting and another than offers a ‘cinematic’ pan. Both of these hugely increase the versatility of the video feature. Still, with the iPhone 12 offering Dolby Vision capture and editing the Pixel 5 still feels a little bit lacking.
Battery life – Has Google fixed its battery life woes with the Pixel 5?
For such a small phone, the 4080mAh battery inside the Pixel 5 seems huge. It’s significantly bigger than the 3140mAh inside the Pixel 4a, for example. Of course, with the 5 you have extra tech eating away at the juice, like 5G and the Smooth Display.
I was very disappointed with the endurance of the Pixel 4 and 4 XL as they were some of the few Android phones of 2019 that required multiple charges to consistently get them through the day. Whether that was down to poor software optimisation or smaller than required cells, the result just wasn’t good enough.
The good news is that Pixel 5 is far better. This can easily make it through the day, even with the 90Hz Smooth Display option on and 5G enabled. While these results are lightly a bit skewed by the prevalence of working from home, the Pixel 5 can comfortably get 6 hours of screen-on time and I have gone through a full day and night and not needed to plug in until the following morning. The endurance is certainly better than the iPhone SE (a similarly-sized) phone and in my tests it beats out the S20 (Exynos version) comfortably.
Google isn’t utilising any super-fast charging tech here and the Pixel 5 can’t compete with Super Vooc 65w charging you’ll find in many Oppo (and other brands like OnePlus and Realme) phones. Instead, it’s the usual 18w USB-PD standard solution. A full charge takes about 90 minutes, but you can get 50% in around 30. There’s 10w wireless charging if you’ve got the Pixel Stand charger or slower if you’re using a standard Qi pad.
Wireless charging is far from a given at this price and it’s often a feature left out either to save costs or to heap more focus on a fast wired solution. Even though the speeds are slower, I still find wireless charging a truly useless feature and one’s that I am disappointed to see ditched so often.
There’s a reverse wireless charging feature too, which is handy for juicing up Qi-enabled buds or smartwatches (or even phones if you’re happy to wait) by plopping them on phone’s back. It’s a little slow yes, but worth it when you’re without a charger and your Pixel Buds have just run out of juice.
Should you buy the Pixel 5?
For £599 (or $699) the Pixel 5 is a surprisingly excellent deal, especially for those who desire a smaller phone and put camera prowess over gaming performance. 
Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t the most exciting phone of 2020, however it’s a smart move from a brand that has struggled to really position itself alongside Apple, Samsung and Huawei as a true flagship smartphone provider.
Throughout my week with the Pixel 5 many aspects have impressed me, from the great display to the solid battery life. It’s well-designed, if a little bland, with a real thought for the user. The aluminium frame and textured back make this one of the nicest phones to hold. I also appreciate Google for keeping some more typically ‘flagship’ features around, notably an IP rating and wireless charging.

Of course, the Pixel’s star quality has always been in its camera. And yes, photos taken with the Pixel 5 are great. It remains the dynamic range champ, with excellent night shooting and the HDR improvements give more realism to faces. But the lack of a zoomed lens does offset it’s versatility somewhat.

Even at the sub-£600 price, the Pixel 5 has lots of competition. There’s the OnePlus 8T which does pack a truly flagship processor and the excellent Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is only slightly more at £699. Then there’s the £699 iPhone 12 Mini, which is even smaller.

Verdict





























 



If you want pure performance, an excellent screen and some of the fastest charging around then the OnePlus 8T should be near the top of your list. The lower than usual for a flagship price makes it an even more tempting prospect.



Pros

Lovely display
Seriously fast charging
A performance champion
Already on Android 11



Cons

No IP rating
No wireless charging
Fairly useless secondary cameras

With the OnePlus 8T coming on the heels of the great Nord, OnePlus is once again focussing on the midrange market that made it successful to begin with.
There’s no OnePlus 8T Pro this year, leaving the 8T as the sole mid-cycle update for the brand’s flagship device. Considering how good the 8T is, that’s fine by me.
The OnePlus 8T will cost £549 for the 8GB/128GB model and £649 for the 12GB/256GB version.
Screen and Design – The best of OnePlus
The OnePlus 8T is the sort of phone the brand should be making. After a few years of split loyalties between a standard and Pro version, the OnePlus 8T stands alone and does a good job at satisfying both audiences.
Take the screen, for instance. This is a fantastic 6.55-inch OLED 120Hz panel, without the pesky overly curved sides of the OnePlus 8 Pro. The FHD+ resolution is not as sharp as some of the competition, but it’s still supremely colourful with DCI-P3 gamut support and very bright. OnePlus claims it can hit over 1100 nits of brightness and that figure doesn’t sound wrong.
The 120Hz refresh rate, higher than the 90Hz on the OnePlus 8 and 60hz of the iPhone 11, is the star though, giving everything a smooth finish. It would have been nice if OnePlus had taken a page from Samsung’s book and allowed the refresh rate to ramp up and down depending on what you’re doing, but it doesn’t. It’ll either stay at 120Hz or 60Hz. A 240Hz sampling rate makes for more precise and responsive gaming too.
Related: Best mid-range phones

It’s a large display, and covers the majority of the phone’s front. There’s a small cut out for the front camera and a slightly chunkier bezel under the display – but neither of these ruin the immersion of such an excellent panel.
Flip the phone over and you’ve got a Gorilla Glass 4 back, with a new rectangular camera housing. The back isn’t matte, but whatever covering OnePlus has added does a great job at reducing the prevalence of smudges and fingerprints. That’s especially obvious on this blue (or Aquamarine, as OnePlus calls it) hue.
The colour itself is bright and catches the light nicely. There’s a less ostentatious grey/silver model too. It would have been nice for OnePlus to bring back its classic Sandstone finish here to help differentiate the OnePlus 8T, but at least you can still get that finish in case form.
It’s good to see the sides are still aluminium for added rigidity. On the other hand, the lack of an official IP rating is a shame (but not altogether surprising) and there’s no headphone jack either. Neither of these is a deal breaker and often par for the course at this price.
What you do have around the sides is a clicky volume rocker, ring slider that’s ace for easily slipping into silent mode and a USB-C port on the bottom.
Performance – Fast chip, huge amounts of RAM and plenty of storage
Most phones in the OnePlus 8T’s price range go for the Snapdragon 765G (Pixel 5, for example) rather than a top-end chipset in order to save money, however that’s not a move OnePlus has made. 
Like the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, the 8T uses the high-end Snapdragon 865 (not the more graphically-capable Plus version) and pairs that with either 8GB or 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM. I’ve been using the 12GB model and while it’s probably overkill, there’s no doubting it makes for a seriously smooth phone. Storage is healthy too, at either 128GB or 256GB. In typical OnePlus style, there’s no microSD slot so choose your storage capacity wisely.
The combination of the 865 chip, 12GB of memory and 120Hz screen put the OnePlus 8T up there with the fastest phones around. It can handle anything you throw at it, from intensive games on their highest graphical settings to heavy image editing. It stays perfectly cool too and the only time it got hot was during the initial setup when hundreds of apps were installing.

The OnePlus 8T is a 5G phone, like all of the OnePlus phones this year. If you’re in a 5G area, on the right plan and with a capable SIM (the likelihood is that your SIM is already 5G capable) then you will be able to reap the new tech’s benefits. While I wouldn’t recommend upgrading just to get 5G, as it gets more common and faster the compatibility will be nice to have.
Related: What is 5G?
Outside of this, you’ve got WiFi 6 support, good call quality and adequate speakers. Pretty much everything you’d expect from a OnePlus phone. There’s a fingerprint sensor inside the display that’s fine – it’s quick, though not that reliable and face unlock.
Software – OnePlus moves away from its ‘stock’ Android roots and it’s for the best
When OnePlus first unveiled its new OxygenOS version based on Android 11, I read a lot of negative opinions about it. This is quite a big departure from the once very ‘stock’ look of previous iterations and that seemed to have irked many. But the fact of the matter is that even Google’s own Pixel phones now run very different launchers than what was once considered stock Android.
The new software here bares more than a passing resemblance to the OneUI you’ll find on Samsung phones. Not necessarily in terms of design, but there’s a similar focus on making more of the display real-estate and moving UI elements into more accessible positions.

I like the look of the software and it packs a number of genuinely great features. The native apps are far better than before, there’s still a good reliance on Google services and finally you’ve got an option for an always-on display. 
The reader mode that turns apps like Kindle monochrome is thankfully still around and you can now swipe down from the homescreen to access a handy panel filled with widgets and shortcuts. It all feels very well designed and easy to use.
OnePlus has also shown itself skilled at getting yearly Android updates out quickly and the OnePlus 8T is one of the first phones that isn’t a Pixel to come with the new version of Google’s OS.

Camera – The OnePlus 8T takes good photos and has a lot of modes
OnePlus phones’ cameras have never truly impressed me. They’ve not been bad, but it’s always felt like more time was spent elsewhere rather than fine-tuning the photography experience. It’s more of the same here: the 8T can take good looking snaps that have a real social-media pop, it has a load of features and focal lengths and is very fast to use. But if camera performance is your biggest desire then you might be better off looking at the Pixel 4a or 5.
Related: Best camera phones

With the OnePlus 8T you’ve got a bevvy and sensors and lenses. There’s a main 48MP Sony IMX586 (that’s the same as you’ll find in the OnePlus 8) with OIS and an f/1.7 aperture; a 16MP ultra wide; a 5MP macro for close-up shots and a 2MP monochrome lens.
Let’s start with the main sensor. The snaps from this camera are good, with a heavy reliance on strong HDR effects for a very social-media friendly result. If you’ve got a shot with lots of competing (the cloudy landscapes below) elements, you’ll have real standout colours that can often look a bit unnatural. There’s definitely some smoothing going on in the post-processing too, which is obvious when you zoom in. Still, most of the shots are I got were decent and the camera is reliable. 
Colours are strong and there’s plenty of detail in the 12MP shots
Colours can have a tendency to look a little too vivd – take this green, it wasn’t this bright in real life
You get a nice natural background blur
There’s a low light shooting mode that adds a lot more brightness – sometimes too much – and this is good if the situation is really dark.
The ultra wide camera is good too. The view is far wider than the Pixel 5 and while the colours and processing aren’t exactly the same, they are good enough for day to day casual snappers.
The ultra wide is very wide
I have less good things to say about the other sensors. The 5MP macro sensor is nothing but a gimmick, while the monochrome sensor just turns photos black and white. The results don’t look much better than using a simple filter. These two ‘cameras’ don’t need to be here.
Video shooting is much the same as it was on the OnePlus 8 (4k 60, FHD 480fps). There is some improved stabilisation and a new video portrait mode that blurs the background, but the latter is a little hit-and-miss, just as it has been on every phone that’s tried it.
Battery life – A full charge in 40 minutes changes how you think about battery life
Battery life is, on the whole, very good, but it’s the phone’s seriously impressive charging skills that stand out more.
You can fully charge a completely depleted OnePlus 8T is about 40 minutes and get 50% in less than 20. This speed is achieved by having dual batteries inside the phone that charge independently from one power source.
Of course, you will need to use the, rather bulky, 65w brick to get these speeds. Thankfully this charger is also powerful enough to charge some laptops or a Nintendo Switch so it’s handy to have around.
Those two internal cells add up to a 4500mAh capacity and the OnePlus 8T can make it through the day, averaging more than six hours of screen on time. That’s with the 120Hz screen option, but no 5G.
Related: Best phones
I have found my attitude to charging change since putting my SIM into the OnePlus 8T. A quick 15 minute charge while I am having a shower in the evening means I won’t have to charge it the next day or if I forget that then a quick plug in while I am making my morning coffee. We’ve had quick charging for ages now, but this is the next step.
OnePlus isn’t the first to introduce this and it won’t be the last. The tech is likely using the same smarts that Oppo uses in its Super VOOC charging. Oppo and OnePlus sit under the same umbrella company and Realme (another brand in the same situation) uses it too under a different name. Qualcomm has already announced its own plans too, with the next-gen Quick Charge standard bringing much faster charging to a wider array of phones.
The only real downside is that lack of Qi wireless charging. You’ll need the OnePlus 8 Pro for that.
Should you buy the OnePlus 8T?
If you want pure performance, an excellent screen and some of the fastest charging around then the OnePlus 8T should be near the top of your list. The lower than usual for a flagship price makes it an even more tempting prospect.

Verdict



































The Xperia 5 II is one of a growing number of phones looking to pull the same trick as the Pixel a-series or Apple-SE line of phones.
Like its inspiration, the phone aims to take a number of Sony’s flagship phone features and bring them down to a more affordable price point that regular consumers can actually stomach.
While the strategy is fairly tried and tested in today’s market, the Xperia 5 II is technically a marvel featuring a number of features you won’t find on competing handsets.
But, with it being late to the party,  and now even more affordable rivals like the Galaxy S20 FE out, some people may wonder why they’d opt for the Xperia over its more established competition.
Design and Screen

Sony’s iconic 21:9 display
One of Sony’s best designed phones
Quality OLED with 120Hz

The Xperia 5 II is one of the prettiest and best designed phones Sony has made in quite some time.
It’s got the same atypically tall design as Sony’s current flagship, the Xperia 1 II. This means it is taller and thinner than most traditional phones, featuring a 21:9 aspect ratio.
In the past I’ve had mixed feelings about the design as, while it makes the phones great for extended scrolling and watching modern movies, the 1 II’s sizable 6.5-inch dimensions and angular edges made on occasion awkward to hold.
Thankfully these issues have generally been fixed on the Xperia 5 II which features a more pocketable 6.1-inch screen and rounded corners. The combination of factors make it significantly more comfortable to hold. Picking it up it gave me flashbacks to the original Xperia Compact which to this day remains one of the best small form factor phones ever released.
It also ticks most of the right boxes when it comes to functionality and build quality. For audiophiles with a decent set of cabled headphones there’s a 3.5mm jack up top, Hi-Res audio support and a microSD card slot, which makes it quick and easy to expand its internal storage. 
The IP65/68 also ensures it’s suitably waterproof to survive the odd aquatic adventure, which is a good thing considering how slippy its glass back can get when even moderately damp. Visually my only minor quibble is that, like all glass back phones, it’s an outright fingerprint and smudge magnet.
So far so good? Generally, I’d agree, but I’m not completely sold on the phone’s physical button placement.
The phone has four buttons adorning its right long side. Up top is the volume rocker, below is the power button, which has a built in fingerprint scanner. Below that is a shortcut to Google Assistant and at the very bottom a custom key that works as a shutter button on the camera app out of the box.
I don’t mind the shutter key, but the Assistant and power keys are placed in particularly annoying places. The power key doesn’t sit where your index finger would naturally fall, making unlocking the phone a little finicky. The Assistant key’s positioning places it in a spot that’s all too easy to accidentally push when generally using the phone, making it more an annoyance than aid in most instances.

Screen
Display tech is an increasingly competitive area in the world on smartphones. Which is why it’s no surprise Sony’s gone in guns blazing on it with the Xperia 5 II. Specifically, Sony’s loaded it with a 6.1-inch, FHD+ resolution, OLED screen.
The resolution doesn’t match the 4K resolution see on the Xperia 1 II, but being honest that’s a bonus as it reduces the panel’s power consumption and I’m yet to be sold on the need for UHD on a screen this size – you’re not going to notice the difference unless you do a side by side comparison and really, really, really try.
On top of that it adds a few awesome new features. First off, it has a 120Hz refresh rate. The rate isn’t variable but coupled with the phone’s 240Hz polling rate and Game Enhancer software makes it awesome for GeForce Now and CoD Mobile sessions.
Refresh rate refers to how many images a second a screen updates. As a rule of thumb a higher rate makes for smoother scrolling and more reactive experience. Polling rate refers to how quickly it detects incoming touch commands.
The Game Enhancer software is similar to Black Shark’s Shark Space. It’s a custom overlay that lets you crank, or reduce the refresh rate, capture screen shots, or manage your audio and voice preferences using a pull out shortcut menu in game. 
The combination makes the Xperia 5 II match dedicated gaming phones, such as the Black Shark 3 Pro when it comes to display chops.
On top of that, the HDR support means that compatible content on Netflix and Prime looks wonderfully immersive featuring better dynamic range and wonderfully inky blacks. The 21:9 aspect ratio also adds an air of immersion on many modern movies – which are mastered this way.
The only downside is that some apps and older video content hasn’t been mastered to the aspect ratio and will display with large black sections on its top and bottom/sides depending on how you’re holding the phone.
Max brightness levels are also excellent and all in all I the screen easily matches its Samsung, OnePlus and iPhone competition.
But, I do have two minor quibbles. First, the refresh rate isn’t truly variable. This is forgivable given how few phones feature the tech, but it’s still a minor annoyance. It means you will have to lock the phone to a Hz level. This is problematic as locking a phone to 120Hz puts a drain on the battery. Meaning you have to either sacrifice battery life of ease of use.
I’m also not a big fan of its out of the box colour calibration. When you turn on the phone it’s set to “Standard” mode. Despite the naming, this cranks the colours to ridiculous levels making them look overcooked and unrealistic in a bid to make the screen look more dynamic.
Thankfully, there’s a much better “Creator” option that resets the screen to offer much better, more natural colours targeting the BT.2020 colour gamut. I’d thoroughly recommend any buyer switch it to the latter setting the moment you turn on the phone.

Camera

Three 12-megapixel sensors sit on the back
These comprise a wide, ultra wide and telephoto for zoom

Camera tech is another area Sony’s trying to push this year. The setup combines three 12MP sensors. Specifically it’s built of a 12MP main camera with a 24mm lens, a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 16mm lens, and 12MP telephoto sensor with a 70mm lens.
What makes the setup unique is that, like the 1 II it’s trying to bring some of the pro features seen on the firm’s A-series cameras to the Xperia line. This means that the phone’s triple-sensor rear camera arrangement is very effective if it’s in the right hands.
The Pro camera and Video apps sit outside the generic camera and bring with them a number of “professional” controls you won’t find on many competing cameras. These include ISO, white balance, aperture and focus zones.
With these settings and a mobile tripod it is possible to take some outright stunning shots on the Xperia 5 II. I’m a particularly big fan of how it handles colours. Shots look natural and don’t have the overprocessed or sharpened look that seems to be trendy on flagship phones at the moment. Daytime shots looked far more natural than the ones I took on the Galaxy S20 Plus I had to hand.
The auto mode is also capable, though it doesn’t quite match what you get on recent Pixel and Huawei Phones in my mind. The only slight issue I have with the phone’s rear camera is that shutter speeds feel a fraction of a second slower than they should on a handset this price.
There’s a few milliseconds delay between pushing the on screen or physical shutter buttons and a photo being captured. In daylight this doesn’t feel like too much of an issue. But it made it all too easy to accidentally ruin shots in low light, with minor hand shakes and movements causing blurs and aberrations. Which is a shame as the cameras are otherwise fairly good in low light. Focus speeds tell a similar story, making the camera on occasion a little frustrating to use in its auto setting.
Some spec heads may also bemoan the fact it only has 3x optical zoom capabilities. But considering how useless we found the 100x “Space Zoom” functionality on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, I found the functionality more than good enough.
The 8-megapixel front camera is functional, and more than good enough for taking the odd selfie. Though it’s portrait bokeh effect doesn’t match the quality of the dual sensor front camera setups that have started appearing on many flagships.

Performance

Snapdragon 865 along with 8GB RAM
Very snappy to use
5G support

When it comes to silicon horsepower, the Xperia 5 II is about as good as you’ll get at the moment. The 5 II’s loaded with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 CPU and 8GB of RAM. This means the phone can blitz through even the most demanding of tasks. It’ll run CoD hassle free, blitz through GeForce Now streaming and multiple tab web browsing hassle free.
Multi-app support also works a treat thanks to the inclusion of Sony’s custom multi-window feature. This is an app shortcut that lets you display two applications, running at the same time, on the top and bottom of the screen. I found it particularly useful when doing Zoom work calls, as it let me have the document I was referring too open at the same time as the video window. The only downside is that there’s no easy way to open a new app in split screen if you’re already in one. You have to manually come out and click the multi-window shortcut to do it.
The only time I had any issue with performance was when I did a stress test making it record 4K footage at 120fps. After 15 mins the phone began to noticeably heat up, a bit later there was noticeable CPU throttling. This is a little surprising as the phone’s “Heat Suppression Power Control” stopped the same issue occurring during prolonged hour long gaming sessions.
My real world findings were mirrored in the Xperia 5 II’s 903 single- and 3292 multi-core Geekbench 5 scores. These put on a par with nearly all the other Snapdragon 865 handsets we’ve tested this year.

Battery life

4000mAh battery
No wireless charging

The Xpera 5 II offers solid battery life, but it comes with a few compromises compared to most phones this price. The biggest is the lack of any form of wireless charging. This was a design choice by Sony to help improve the handset’s heat dissipation.
It also doesn’t come with a decent fast charger out of the box, despite supporting it, though this is annoyingly a common compromise in today’s world, even in the top end of the market.
With real world use I generally managed to eke out a day and a bit’s use from the Xperia 5 II’s 4000mAh cell. This was with the phone’s screen set to 120Hz, which is fairly impressive and about the same as what we got testing the Galaxy S20. You can also get an extra half day’s worth of juice if you lock the refresh rate to 60Hz, though doing so will make the phone significantly less pleasant to use.
There’s a stamina mode that can be used to radically extend the phone’s battery if needed. The setting turns off everything but the phone’s most basic functions.
As always, intensive tasks do put a bigger drain on the Xperia 5 II’s battery, however. Streaming video via Netflix the Xperia 5 II lost an average of 5-8% of its charge per hour. Gaming put a bigger drain on the battery with it discharging an average of 6-12% per hour. The figures are pretty par for the course for a 120Hz refresh rate phone this size.
You should buy it if…
You’re not fussed on a 4K display
While the Xperia 5 II doesn’t have the 4K panel of the 1 II, it does have a 120Hz refresh rate for much smoother scrolling.
You watch a lot of videos
The 21:9 display is ideal for movies shot in the format. There’s no notch either.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want wireless charging
One of the few missing features here is any form of wireless charging. Considering this isn’t a cheap phone, it would have been nice to see it added.

Verdict



































I can’t say enough good things about the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and if you want a phone that feels very much like a flagship without spending over £699 then this is the best that’s currently on offer.



Pros
Snapdragon 865 even in the UK modelBetter battery life than other S20 modelsNice range of coloursFlat 120Hz display

Cons
You have to pay more for the faster chargerSecondary cameras aren’t the most detailed

Key Features
Review Price: £5996.5-inch OLED 120Hz4500mAh batteryMultiple coloursSnpadragon 865 (5G)



Samsung’s year of phone releases doesn’t seem to be slowing down, with the South Korean brand finally unveiling the much leaked Galaxy S20 FE.
The ‘FE’ moniker here stands for ‘Fan Edition’ and it’s very much a cheaper, mid-year update for the brand’s flagship Galaxy S20 – with a bit of the Note 20’s DNA thrown in for good measure. It looks like it will continue to be sold alongside the Samsung Galaxy S21 in many regions. 
The biggest surprise is that this is a fantastic phone, arguably easier to recommend than any other Samsung mobile this year. Especially if you’re in the UK and want a Samsung Galaxy phone with the Snapdragon 865.
The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (Fan Edition) is available now for £599 (4G, Exynos 990) and £699 for the 5G Snapdragon model. The 4G version won’t be coming to the States.
This pricing puts it directly in competition with the some of the best mid-range phones like the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8T, Moto Edge and LG Velvet. It’s also a similar price to the iPhone 11, which will likely be replaced by an iPhone 12 very soon.
Design and Screen

120Hz OLED display is excellent
Big fan of the flat screen
Overall a very attractive design with various colours available

Samsung has kept a high-quality 120Hz panel for the S20 FE, giving you super-smooth scrolling. It has a 240Hz sampling rate too, for very responsive gaming. Why Samsung didn’t add this feature to the Note 20 feels bizarre to me.
The FE retains an OLED panel with a small cutout at the top for the front camera, however it tops out at FHD+ rather than WQHD+ like on the Galaxy S20. As you couldn’t combine 120hz and the higher-res anyway, this change seems fine to me. 
The screen isn’t quite as colour accurate as of that on the S20 and it lacks HDR 10 support in apps like Netflix, however unless you place both phones next to each other it can be hard to spot. This is still a really nice panel, with enough brightness to combat a harshly sunny day.
There’s an in-display fingerprint scanner here, rather than a physical button like you’ll find on the Pixel 5. It’s slightly different to the sensors Samsung usually uses, as it’s optical as opposed to ultrasonic and as a result needs light to function. You’ll notice a bright light around your finger when you press in and it can be a little annoying if you’re unlocking late at night in a dark room. Still, it’s fast and responsive and there’s face unlock if you’d prefer.

At 6.5-inches, the FE sits between the smaller S20 and the larger S20 Plus. For me, it feels like the perfect size and I really appreciate the flat display which is far superior for gaming than a curved panel.
Like the Galaxy Note 20, the S20 FE ditches the glass back for a tough plastic one. I don’t mind the plastic feel, especially on a more affordable phone like this and I really like the frosted finish which isn’t as prone to picking up fingerprints as glass – always a nice touch. The front remains Gorilla Glass and the sides are constructed from aluminium for a rigid frame.
What’s more important to me is that the phone remains IP68 rated for water resistance and still packs Qi wireless charging. Two features more than often ditched at this price. What is missing is a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you’ll be using the USB-C connector or wireless Bluetooth for audio.
It comes in a number of nice colours too, including a very on-trend navy blue and a striking red. These are far more interesting hues than you can find the S20 in, and Samsung said they all be available from various networks without the usual exclusivity.

Performance

Snapdragon 865 chipset gives it near-flagship performance
5G support but there is a 4G version too
Samsung’s usual One UI overlay over the top of Android

One of the true highlights of the Galaxy S20 FE is that the UK 5G version comes with the Snapdragon 865 platform, rather than the usual Exynos chipset you’ll find in the high-end Note 20 series and Galaxy S20. 
Many have complained about the decreased performance and battery skills of the Exynos version vs the Qualcomm so it’s great to see Samsung deciding to give a wider launch to the arguably superior model.
Now, if you do go for the cheaper 4G version then you will get the Samsung Exynos 990. This variation won’t be available in the States. Paired with that chipset you’ve got 6GB of fast RAM, and 128GB of expandable storage.
The Snapdragon 865 performs better in benchmark tests than the Exynos variation, but the real wins come with the improved battery life – something you can read more on below. As you’d expect from the flagship chipset, performance is top-drawer. Whether you’re gaming on the device, streaming Xbox titles via GamePass or pushing the phone in any other ways it’ll handle everything without getting hot or slowing down.
Audio from the speakers is good, if slightly easily blocked for the bottom speaker, and call quality is typical Samsung standard.
Out-of-the-box the S20 comes with Android 10 and the latest version of One UI. Samsung’s interface has improved immeasurably over the past few years and while it’s very much different from Google’s own vision of Android, I still like how it looks and works. Samsung has also indicated you’ll get three years of system updates, starting with Android 11, which is always good news.

Battery life

Inside there’s a 4500mAh battery
A full recharge should take around 90 minutes 

The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has a 4500mAh battery, matching the Galaxy S20 Plus and outperforming all the other S20 models in my tests. This is almost certainly down to the Snapdragon 865 chip, which seems to be far more efficient than its Exynos counterpart.
While I often struggled to make it through do with the S20 and S20 Plus, doing so with the S20 FE is easy and I can easily achieve more than six hours of screen on time – often more than an hour more.
When it comes to charging there is support for 25w, however in the box there’s a 15w brick – something of a shame. Still, a full charge takes just over 90 minutes so it’s too bad. There’s wireless charging too, and reverse wireless charging.

Camera

Three cameras on the back. Including a 12MP main sensor
You also get a 12MP ultra wide
And finally an 8MP 3x tele

On the back of the S20 FE you’ll find three cameras: the same main 12MP dual pixel sensor from the S20 (which was for a long time one of the best camera phones), which has an f/1.8 aperture and OIS, along with a 12MP ultra wide and 8MP 3x tele camera with OIS. There’s also a 32MP camera around the front.
The main 12MP sensor takes some really great snaps, which shouldn’t come as a surprise as it’s a camera we’ve seen multiple times before and been impressed with on each occasion. Samsung remains the king when it comes to colour-rich, deeply saturated and slightly oversharpened shots and those traits are clear to see here. These images are primed for social media and I can completely understand why they’re so popular.
Are the pictures better than the Pixel 4a? For me, no. But that’s subjective and you certainly do get crispier details and brighter colours here. The Pixel 4a still pips it for dynamic range, natural bokeh and, importantly, night mode.
Low light performance is fine and you can get good shots without great light either in the default mode or the more specific Night option. I find Samsung’s Night mode a little behind some of the rivals, tending to over-brighten and blow out highlights. Still, it’s there if you’re in a very dark situation.
Flipping between focal lengths is easy and the S20 FE takes good snaps at both ultra wide and 3x zoom. Neither of these are of the same quality as the main sensor and the results can be soft, especially when zooming, but they offer a nice bit of versatility. It’s also good to see Samsung not cramming in another sensor for the sake of it, some other brands offering cheaper Android phones should take note…
The 32MP front camera is good for those selfies and it has some software skills to push out a bit and cram more faces in. Video is strong too, even if it doesn’t possess the 8K skills of the regular S20.
See below for some camera samples:
You’ll get seriously bright colours even from the wide angle camera
There’s plenty of detail and the focusing works even up close

3x zoom: This isn’t a zoom king, but it’ll get the job done
You should buy it if…
You want a Snapdragon 865 version of the S20
In the UK, we only got a version of the Galaxy S20 with Samsung’s own Exynos chipset inside. It was fine but suffered from lesser performance and poor battery life when compared to the Snapdragon model. That’s fixed here, ad the 5G model of the S20 FE packs the very quick Snapdragon 865.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want the best secondary cameras
Really, there’s very little to not like about the S20 FE and it’s certainly one of the best phones at its price. Being picky, the quality of the secondary cameras does leave a lot to be desired and they feel they’ve been added simply as the parts were on the cheaper side.

Verdict




























 



If you like your phones cheap, solidly built, and stripped of all gimmicks, then the Sony Xperia L4 might appeal. Other than its stretched out 21:9 display, there’s virtually nothing noteworthy about it. Poor performance and so-so stamina mean we can’t get behind it with any degree of enthusiasm, but this is another fundamentally sound budget phone from Sony.



Pros

Refreshingly chintz-free design
Crisp, unadorned software
Camera capable of decent shots in optimal lighting



Cons

Deeply mediocre performance
Slightly dim 720p display
Underwhelming stamina
Running Android 9

Sony made quite an impression earlier this year with the Sony Xperia 1 II, an extravagantly priced flagship phone with a fine Pro camera and a pin-sharp 4K display. Now the Sony Xperia L4 pares things back further, offering a super-widescreen experience in an ostensibly similar form factor (squinting required) for just £169. 
History tells us that this most technically gifted of manufacturers doesn’t exactly shine with such a restrictive budget. Can the L4 hope to change that perception?
With an extremely modest spec sheet and an uninspired design, it’s hardly a major leap forward from the underwhelming Sony Xperia L3. But there’s something to be said for simply getting the basics right, with a modicum of taste, at this end of the market.
Design and screen – Boxy, functional design and a dim but tall display
The Sony Xperia L4 subscribes to the Sony design playbook, with a plain all-in-one plastic moulded rear that extends around the sides. Not for Sony the faux-glass back panel and faux-metal edges of some of its budget rivals.
It’s a deeply unfussy placeholder of a design that reminds of those generic unbranded phone designs that you see on low budget TV ads. But that gives it a certain low-key appeal, helped by this model’s no-nonsense shade of black.
The Xperia L4 sits nicely in the hand too, thanks to its subtly curved edges and narrow body. At 178g, it’s not too heavy either.
You get a proper USB-C port on the bottom edge, which isn’t a guarantee at this price point (hello Honor 9A). Here that modern port sits next to a rather gutless mono speaker, so it’s a good job there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top.

On the left edge of the phone you get SIM tray access without the need of a SIM tool, which is a bit of a Sony trademark. The opposite edge gives you a dedicated side-mounted fingerprint sensor, which sits in between the power and volume controls.
I would have preferred an integrated power button solution, like the Xperia 10 II, but it remains a clean and effective biometric system. It’s certainly better than the cheaper in-display solutions that are out there.
It’s slightly disappointing that Sony gave into market trends and adopted a notch. Sure, Sony’s phones have often been taller and less sleek than their rivals, but that at least gave them the advantage of being distinctive.
Sony has stretched out the Xperia L4 display’s screen to a 21:9 aspect ratio, compared to the Xperia L3’s more conventional 18:9. This makes for an ultra-widescreen proposition for certain cinematic content. Which would be more of a shouting point were it not for the presence of that teardrop notch.
Whatever flaws could be found elsewhere, you always knew that a Sony phone would give you a clean, unimpeded widescreen picture. Not so with the Xperia L4, although it could be argued that this matters a whole lot less given the cost-related compromises found elsewhere.
For one thing, this is an LCD display rather than the OLED of most pricier phones. Colours stand out less, and blacks are much greyer, as you’d expect. But in an ideal world the L4’s screen would have gotten a little brighter than it does. I found myself cranking it up to full most of the time. Still, the basic picture quality is pretty sound, even if you don’t get things like HDR support.
More problematic is the Xperia L4’s sub-standard resolution. At just 720 x 1680, it can’t even output Full HD content natively. 720p is where it’s at.

This isn’t too unusual at this end of the market. Recently we saw the Honor 9A with a very similar set-up, while budget titan the Moto G8 also comes in at 720p. This strikes us as a false turn for the wider budget market rather than Sony specifically, but it still manages to disappoint every time we see it.
Going back to that 21:9 aspect ratio for a second, it’s worth mentioning that relatively little of the video content most people consume will take advantage of the extra space. Most of it will leave thick black borders to either side.
Games certainly do benefit, however, and tend to feel a little more immersive. But as we’ll discuss next, the Xperia L4 doesn’t really have the power to make the most of this.
Performance – Poor performance regardless of the price
You should never set your sights too high when it comes to performance in a £170 phone. A phone’s choice of processor is extremely price-sensitive.
Nevertheless, it’s fair to say that the Sony Xperia L4 is not a top runner, even within its limited budget price bracket. The use of a Mediatek MT6762R Helio P22 pitches it below any low-end phone that runs a Snapdragon 6-series CPU.
We recently saw this in the Honor 9A, which runs on the exact same chip as the L4, and with the same 3GB of RAM. And the L4’s performance is similarly underwhelming, with a woeful Geekbench multicore score of 850 and a single core score of 145. The Moto G8 with its Snapdragon 665 scored 1321 and 311 respectively.
Zipping through home screens and opening apps isn’t excruciatingly slow here, as such. Everything moves along. But there are frequent stutters and pauses that serve as a constant reminder that you’re using a lesser product.
Gaming performance really drives this home. The new 1.0 version of PUBG Mobile takes ages to load and runs haltingly on the L4, even with the default graphical settings set down to virtually the lowest point. Elsewhere Grimvalor, which typically runs flawlessly on modest hardware, threw up the odd pause and stutter.
Even 2D fare like Juicy Realm struggled on the Xperia L4, asking me if I wanted to drop to low spec mode at the outset. When I didn’t, the frame rate proved to be pretty awful.
On the plus side, NFC has been included here, so you can use Google Pay for mobile payments. Not every cheap phone includes this, so props to Sony for the inclusion.
It’s also good to see that even extremely cheap phones are now getting a practical amount of storage. The 64GB on offer here isn’t particularly special any more, but that’s a good thing.

Camera – A decidedly budget camera with no surprises
Sony is something of a camera phone king maker, given that it provides the camera sensors for much of the smartphone industry. Yet its own cameras don’t often stand out from their peers.
The Sony Xperia L4 follows the same pattern. Its hardware is underwhelming, with a ‘triple’ camera set-up that’s really a double, while the software doesn’t really offer anything new or innovative.
The main sensor is a 13-megapixel f/2.0, backed by a 5-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide. The third sensor is a 2-megapixel f/2.4 depth sensor, and so doesn’t take any shots of its own. There is no telephoto lens, so any zoom shots will be crops. In other words: don’t take zoom shots on the Sony Xperia L4.
Following suit, the camera UI is a modest, stripped back affair with precious few gimmicks or stand-out features. At this end of the market that can actually be seen as a bit of a relief.
While there’s a basic auto scene selector, I found that I needed to activate HDR mode for myself, which was a bit of a pain. The weedy limited camera would tend to wash out brighter areas and leave areas of shade looking rather murky, and a second pass with HDR initiated would invariably balance them up.
Barebones provision aside, I was quite surprised with the crispness of some of the shots I managed to take in ideal lighting. One street shot taken in Birmingham’s Chinatown captured all of the vibrant colours and details of the scene quite well.
Another couple of shots of a dog in front of some coloured balls really stood out for the detail in the dog’s fur and the grass. Zooming in on these wasn’t a good idea, of course, but the basic shot composition felt like it came from a slightly more expensive phone.
Outside of ‘ideal’ conditions though, the Xperia L4 struggles. There’s that aforementioned issue with dynamic range, and even with HDR activated shots can tend to overexpose.
Attempting to shoot in low light is a mistake, too. There’s a Night scene mode, but it doesn’t seem to employ the same multi-shot technique of the better examples on the market. The result is loads of noise and a fundamental lack of clarity.
Certain close up food shots I took struggled to keep the foreground elements in focus, meanwhile.
As so often with cheaper phones, the ultrawide sensor is a bit of a write off. Shots with this sensor are universally murky, blurry, and generally unpleasant to look at.
You get an 8-megapixel front camera, which is adequate for selfies provided you feed it plenty of light. Video capture, meanwhile, is an unremarkable 1080p and 30fps. But it’ll do at a push.
Software – Crisp, clean UI, if a little dated
With Android 11 just hitting the market, the Xperia L4’s used of Android 9 feels a little outdated.
That aside, Sony’s clean, relatively stripped back take on Android is comfortably in the top half of the table when it comes to custom UIs. It’s especially welcome at the lower end of the market, where tacky and inefficient software can exacerbate any hardware issues.
On the Sony Xperia L4, it feels like Sony’s unfussy software gives the phone’s limited specs vital breathing space. Everything’s where it should be and well-ordered, and the fonts and menus are clean and crisp.
It stands in stark contrast with the very similarly specced Honor 9A, which really suffers from clutter. That phone also struggled with a lack of Google apps and services, whereas the Sony Xperia L4 embraces them. Google Feed sits to the left of a home screen that features Google Maps, Photos, Messages, youTube, the Chrome browser and the Play Store, as well as an additional Google folder.
Sony doesn’t go too heavy with its own apps, but there’s a 21:9 Multi-window app on the main home screen, which enables you to run multiple apps side by side or stacked one on top of the other. It worked well on the Sony Xperia 1 II and Sony Xperia 10 II, but the Xperia L4 has neither the snappy performance nor a sufficiently high resolution display to really make it sing.
One criticism I do have about Sony’s software is the number of updates I received. Three major updates feels like too many in a space of less than a week.

Battery Life – Not the best stamina for the price, but adequate
The Sony Xperia L4 has a 3580mAh battery, which is a pretty decent size for a budget phone. No, it’s not as big as the 5000mAh monstrosities found in the Honor 9A, the Realme 5, and the Moto G8 Power.
But those are exceptionally large. The Xperia L4’s battery is only fractionally smaller than that of its big brother, the Sony Xperia 10 II, which sports a more power-hungry 1080p OLED display.
What this all amounts to is a phone that will get you through a full day of moderate usage, and not much more. It’s certainly not a full two dayer like the aforementioned Honor 9A.
Media tends to hit it fairly hard too. We did our usual test of running a Netflix video at full screen brightness for an hour, after which the Xperia L4 had lost 12% of its charge.
By comparison, the Honor 9A lost 8% of a charge in this test, and the Realme 5 lost 9%. Not a particularly great result, especially when you consider how lightly that dim 720p display must be going on the battery.
There’s no fast charging with the Sony Xperia L4 either, with a scant 7.5W charger bundled in.
Should you buy the Sony Xperia L4?
The Sony Xperia L4 is a decent low-key pick if you’re shopping on a strict budget of £170 or less. However, it’s far from making an appearance in our best phone or best cheap phone lists. 
Its design will turn neither heads nor stomachs, which is precisely what some people will be after. Its unassuming looks are accompanied by an adequate display and super clean software, which combines to produce a relatively hassle-free day to day experience.
Relatively, but not entirely. The L4 is not a very good performer, and its camera proves to be solid rather than spectacular. You can certainly get better stamina for your money, meanwhile.

Verdict





























 



The Vivo X50 Pro is one of the surprise packages of the year, providing cutting edge camera technology and a highly desirable design for a mid-market price. Clunky software and availability quirks keep it from being an outright elite contender, but anyone looking for a stylish and great-value all-rounder with a distinctive flavour should add it to their shortlist.



Pros

Super-steady gimbal camera shots
Beautiful premium design
Bright, fast display



Cons

Ugly, overly busy software
Questions linger over availability
You can get better performance for the money






Key Specifications

Gimbal-style camera
5G
90Hz display
Fast charging


Vivo might not be a global name, but this Chinese tech firm knows what it’s doing. The fact that it’s owned by the company behind Oppo and OnePlus should pique your interest now that it’s starting to extend its reach globally.
But that’s not the main reason to be excited about the new Vivo X50 Pro. Vivo has established a reputation for innovation and experimentation in an increasingly staid smartphone space. The Vivo X20 Plus UD was the first phone with an in-display fingerprint sensor, while the Vivo NEX was the first phone to pack a pop-up selfie camera.
What the Vivo X50 Pro has to offer is arguably more exciting than either of those two pioneers. This is the first mainstream phone to feature gimbal camera technology, promising a level of mechanical shot stabilisation that hasn’t been seen before.
This is no gimmick, nor is it the sole point of interest in the Vivo X50 Plus. While the full Western release details remain a little hazy (It’s probably going to be a £500-ish phone), it’ll be highly appealing to those looking for one of the best mid-range phone if you can track one down.
Design and screen – Beautiful high-end design and a fast 90Hz AMOLED
The first thing that struck us about the Vivo X50 Pro is what a strikingly pretty phone it is. Many phones attempt the whole ‘flagship looks for half the price’ thing before, but there aren’t many that have been as convincing as this.
It’s a combination of factors, led by the phone’s dual-curved display edges. Like them or loathe them, they scream premium. Then there is the phone’s skinny 8mm chassis, which weighs a just-so 182g. Not heavy, as such, but just solid enough to whisper ‘premium’ again in case you missed it the first time.
The choice of materials is on point for a 2020 flagship phone, too. It’s not just that the chassis is metal and that the two main surfaces are glass. It’s that the metal frame has pleasingly machined recesses on the top and bottom, and another where the buttons sit on the right hand edge.
That glass rear, meanwhile, has a lovely matte finish in a pleasing grey-blue colour. Together with a justifiably serious-looking Pro camera module (it even says ‘Pro’ on it), I found myself getting distinct Huawei P40 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S20 vibes. Those are design reference points any modern best phone would like to have, let alone one that’s available for potentially hundreds of pounds less.

The lack of a headphone jack and the presence of an in-display fingerprint sensor are further flagship indicators, for better or for worse.
Flipping the phone over, you’re confronted with a fine 6.56-inch FHD+ AMOLED display. It gets really bright, and the colours are appropriately vibrant. I preferred to turn those saturated AMOLED colours down a notch from Standard mode to Normal mode (not the most expressive use of the English language), but plenty will be happy to stick.
Also agreeable is the Vivo X50 Pro display’s 90Hz refresh rate. It’s set to automatically adjust its application by default, but I switched it on permanently and didn’t feel that it massively hit the battery life. And the benefits, as seen elsewhere, are more than worth it in terms of general feel.

Performance – Another ‘just right’ showing from the Snapdragon 765G
The Snapdragon 765G is the chip manufacturers have started turning to when they want to produce a phone that feels like a flagship, but costs a good deal less.
The OnePlus Nord, the Oppo X2 Neo, and the Moto Edge have all previously utilised the Snapdragon 765G’s ability to drive a 90Hz display and run high-end 3D games on a budget. It works a treat with the Vivo X50 Pro too, especially when paired with a healthy 8GB of RAM.
In general navigation and light tasks, the phone feels super fast and fluid. It’s almost on a par with more capable (and pricier) 90Hz phones like the OnePlus 8 and the Huawei P40 Pro, which run the superior Snapdragon 865 and Kirin 990 respectively.
As with the OnePlus Nord and co. I was able to pick up on the slightest of pauses and stutters when moving through menus and navigating the web. It’s not something most will notice, unless they’ve used a lot of Snapdragon 865 devices like I have. Indeed, it often feels faster than the similarly priced Poco F2 Pro, which runs on the Snapdragon 865 CPU but only sports a 60Hz display.
Of course, if it’s raw performance you’re after, the Poco F2 Pro is the better bet. That’s evident when running 3D games like PUBG, which defaults to the graphical settings just below the very best – though it still looks and runs well even when you crank things up. I also picked up on a few pauses when playing beautiful time-manipulation puzzler The Gardens Between on the X50 Pro. The flowing 2D action-platformer gameplay of Dead Cells ran great though.

While on the subject of games, it’s worth mentioning that you won’t get flagship-level sound from the provided mono speaker. It’s loud and clear enough, but can’t match the audio output of genuine flagships.
Again, to the vast majority of users, these cut corners and slight performance hitches won’t prove consequential or even apparent. The Snapdragon 765G is fast proving itself to be the Goldilocks ‘just right’ chip of 2020, and the Vivo X50 Pro runs precisely as well as it needs to.
Camera – Steady showing from pioneering gimbal tech
By far the Vivo X50 Pro’s biggest selling point is its gimbal-assisted camera system, which is the first of its kind in a smartphone.

This main 48-megapixel f/1.6 gimbal camera is backed by an 8-megapixel periscope lens that’s good for a true 5X optical zoom, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 13-megapixel 2X ‘portrait’ sensor. A decent spread of components in a less-than-premium package, for sure. But back to that gimbal.
By implementing a double-ball suspension mount capable of triple-axis rotation, Vivo has given us a main camera that can adjust its orientation in three dimensions to compensate for hand movement. This has largely positive repercussions right throughout the camera experience.
In general conditions, your snaps will be steadier than they’ve ever been. It’s slightly uncanny being confronted with the kind of rock-solid viewfinder image that you usually only get when you prop up against a solid surface. Or perhaps that uncanniness comes from the slightly wallowy sense of lag whenever you come to frame your shot.


That effect is further magnified – quite literally – when you zoom beyond the 5X limits of the 8-megapixel periscope lens. Whilst shots up to 60X still won’t look particularly great (there’s way too much cropping involved), it is at least possible to steady your shot to a degree that’s almost comically impossible with the 100x Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra.


Night and low light photography is another beneficiary of this gimbal. Movement is the enemy of all Night modes, as the shutter is typically left open for longer to let more light in. While you’ll still need to control your subjects, the gimbal ensures a much steadier base as standard. Result: the night time cityscapes looked way better than they typically would from a non-Google or non-flagship phone.

One shot I took of a Church garden at night looks so bright that it verges on the unnatural – I could barely even see the door with my own eyes at the time.
The gimbal tech also benefits video shooting on the X50 Pro, with a noticeable steadying effect when shooting whilst walking. Even when flipping to the 5X zoom, the shots stayed nice and stable.
That’s enough gimbal tech talk. How well does the Vivo X50 Pro actually shoot? Pretty well, but there’s room for improvement. While colours were generally vibrant and well-balanced, there was a tendency to make brighter hues look ever so slightly false. Some of the blue skies captured looked unusually blue, regardless of the camera.
There’s also a slight tendency to overexpose extremely bright areas, which is a common complaint from less than top notch cameras. Focusing, too, could be a little wayward at times, particularly in lesser lighting conditions.

Meanwhile the Wide angle camera is adequate rather than good. Shots taken with it tend to take on a smudgy, defocused look towards the edges – again, a common trait of less than top-end cameras.


I also noticed few instances where I almost seemed to catch the X50 Pro out, taking a snapshot before it seemed to have set itself, in scenarios where I would reasonably expect any other decent camera to have captured the moment. Is this related to the gimbal technology and its inherently wallowy nature? Maybe.
Portrait shots, meanwhile, automatically apply a whole bunch of horrible beauty effects, and it’s not immediately apparent how to deactivate entirely (it’s the left-most option).
Macro shots – which use that so-so ultrawide sensor – occasionally lacked detail, with some oddly grainy bokeh artefacts at times.

Shots taken on the Vivo X50 Pro are good, with particularly strong results when zooming. It’s way more flexible than pretty much any other £500-or-thereabouts cameraphone I can think of. Still, I can’t wait to see this gimbal technology applied to a genuinely top notch shooter with optics, algorithms and image processing to match.
One other tiny little thing that bugged us about the X50 Pro’s camera experience was that Vivo – like Xiaomi and certain other Chinese manufacturers – opts to activate a branded watermark by default. But that’s more an indictment of the phone’s sub-optimal software.
Software – Funtouch 10.5 UI is the X50 Pro’s biggest weakness
The Vivo X50 Pro’s hardware offering is incredibly persuasive. It’s a shame, then, that it falls down on software.
Vivo’s Funtouch 10.5 UI starts from a reasonably solid footing, with a basic home screen look that doesn’t stray too far from stock Android. The icons look round and tidy, and Google Feed is situated to the left of the home screen, as it should be.
But there are lots of small frustrations that amount to a less than optimal experience overall. In no particular order: there are two web browsers, you don’t get Google Calendar by default, and there’s an extra App Store called the V-Store that occasionally and mystifyingly forces itself to the fore.
The presence of superfluous apps like Lazada (a deals app) and Touch ’n Go (an eWallet app) speak to a device that’s been made predominantly with parts of East Asia in mind rather than Western markets. It serves as a reminder that there remains an air of doubt over Vivo’s wider rollout plans.
You’ll see Jovi pop up from time to time in the settings and notifications menu. It turns out to be the name of Vivo’s smart assistant, offering image recogniser and a smart scene tools, but it all seems a little half-baked and inessential.

Extraneous apps aside, Funtouch 10.5 UI is full of elements that haven’t been executed quite right. There are a lot of bafflingly indistinct notifications zinging all over the place, to the point where the notification bar verges on the useless as a quick heads-up tool. And some of the notifications you might value most – from WhatsApp, say – seem to go missing until you open the app up. It just feels at times like you’re getting the information Vivo chooses to surface, rather than the information you actually want.
On the plus side, the always-on display function is quite neat, though it’s not active by default for some reason. Elsewhere the offer of split screen access when notifications come in during full screen video content is a nice touch, though again, it doesn’t feel like the smoothest execution.
Battery Life – Decent stamina encourages you to use that camera
Vivo has outfitted the X50 Pro with a 4315 mAh battery, which is roughly the same capacity as that of the similarly proportioned OnePlus 8. In terms of how that translates into stamina, I was able to get through a full extended day consistently without worrying about a recharge, regardless of how intensive a day I’d had.
At the end of a long 15 hours day in which I took around 180 photos and shot four brief 1080p videos, in mostly day time outdoors conditions (which meant the screen was always on full brightness), and with the 90Hz display refresh rate permanently on, I was left with 27% in the tank. That’s quite reassuring.
In terms of media usage, the X50 Pro hits par. One hour of Netflix streaming with the screen set to half brightness sapped 10% of a charge. That’s exactly the same result as the OnePlus Nord, which has the same processor and a similar 90Hz AMOLED display – although it’s worth pointing out that The Nord also has a slightly smaller battery.
Another point in the Vivo X50 Pro’s favour is that it comes with support for 33W fast charging, which can get you from 1% to 57% in just 30 minutes.
Should you buy the Vivo X50 Pro?
The Vivo X50 Pro is an unexpected delight, thanks to a lovely premium design, a fast and fluid 90Hz AMOLED display, and a steady gimbal camera that’s no gimmick. You can get better performance for £500 these days, but most people won’t need it.
Are these design and camera advantages worth spending extra over the OnePlus Nord? To a certain type of user, most definitely. But this needs to balanced against the Vivo X50 Pro’s sub-standard software, which actively hampers that premium impression compared to the Nord.
It’s no exaggeration to say that if Vivo had made the X50 Pro a Google One phone, or gone with a Motorola-style light reskinning, it would be a major contender for the best phone in its class. Its hardware is that good.
As it stands, the Vivo X50 Pro is a distinctively compelling alternative to the usual upper-mid-range/budget flagship crowd – provided you can get your hands on one in your territory, of course, which is far from a given.

Verdict





























 



Whether it warrants its Pro moniker or not, the Poco F2 Pro is a deeply compelling mid-range handset. There aren’t many phones that offer this level of performance at such a competitive price.



Pros

Bright, well-calibrated display
Flagship performance
Strong battery life



Cons

Hefty design
Display only 60Hz
Camera results quite mixed






Key Specifications

Snapdragon 865
Quad rear camera setup
20-megapixel pop-up front camera
6.67-inch Super AMOLED screen
In-display fingerprint sensor
4700mAh battery


If I was to make one wish for a prospective Poco F3 Pro, it would be to step things up to 90Hz. While the Poco F2 Pro impresses in a number of areas, it does have some missing features when compared to the rest of the crowd at this price.
You do get an in-display fingerprint sensor though, and it’s reasonably fast and responsive as far as these things go. Which isn’t as far as traditional dedicated biometric sensors, but that’s hardly an issue that’s unique to Xiaomi.
Audio is another aspect of the Poco F2 Pro that’s only partially Pro. On the one hand, you get a 3.5mm jack and support for Hi-Res Audio. On the other, there’s only a single downwards-firing speaker, which proves easy to cover when playing landscape-oriented games.

Performance – The Poco F2 Pro offers elite performance at a bargain price
While the Poco F2 Pro’s lack of a 90Hz display might not make it seem as fast as one or two of its mid-range rivals, it proves its mettle under pressure. With a Snapdragon 865 powering things, it’s as capable as any other Android phone on the market right now, regardless of price.
You’re stuck with a 60Hz refresh rate, but it’s a rock-solid 60Hz. There’s no hint of stutter or delay, with apps booting up and switching with the no-nonsense speed only a flagship phone can muster.
The amount of RAM you get varies by model, and not just by capacity. Our unit came with the full 8GB of super-fast LPDDR5 RAM, but the entry-level model gives you 6GB of slightly slower LPDDR4X.

Games ran beautifully, from the fluid 2D action platforming of Dead Cells to the stunning 3D time-manipulation puzzles of The Gardens Between. There’s also a Game Turbo mode buried in the Settings menu, which lets you optimise the phone’s resources for gameplay.
There were some problems connecting a Bluetooth controller, though. I tried two different PS4 pads of markedly different vintages, and with both the experience was laggy and downright unplayable.
Still, an average Geekbench 5 score of 902 single-core and 3,312 multi-core confirms that this is a top-level performer. It’s certainly refreshing given the recent trend to go with the lesser Snapdragon 765G in many of the best mid-range phones like the OnePlus Nord, the Motorola Edge and the Oppo Find X2 Neo.

Camera – Not bad, but definitely not ‘Pro’
Another way in which the Poco F2 Pro ostensibly earns its Pro stripes is with its camera. It’s certainly a much more advanced set-up than the Pocophone F1, but it doesn’t get close to rivalling the very best camera phones on the market.
The main sensor is a 64-megapixel unit. You also get a 13-megapixel ultra-wide-angle sensor, a 5-megapixel macro sensor, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. As always, those latter two don’t really matter all that much.
But the main sensor is interesting. It’s a Sony IMX686, which is the same sensor you’ll find in the Xiaomi Redmi K30 Pro, the Asus ROG Phone 3, and the Vivo X30 Pro. It’s significantly larger than the IMX586 before it, which is the component used in the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus Nord, among many others.


In good lighting, the Poco F2 Pro is capable of capturing genuinely excellent shots. There is a slight tendency to overexpose elements, but the colour balance is pretty on point.
The ultrawide sensor matches the tone quite well too, though there’s the usual excess noise at the edges that you always get with cheaper wide-angle sensors. The 2X zoom works quite well in the absence of dedicated optics, for which you can probably thank that high megapixel main sensor.

It’s far from a flawless shooting experience, however. Indoors shots and those in less than ideal (but not outright dark) lighting conditions were disappointingly noisy. Several early evening shots taken at an open-sided tent meal yielded blurry, unfocussed faces, while there are weird grainy artefacts on the white walls of a kitchen brunch scene. The lack of any OIS can’t have helped in these conditions – an omission that doesn’t strike as being particularly Pro.
There’s also the odd inexplicable irritant to be found here. Why are both the auto HDR and AI scene selector tools turned off by default? And why does Xiaomi persist with its horrible image watermark?

There’s a dedicated Night mode, and it’s reasonably effective at brightening up darker scenes, but it does throw up the odd visual artefact in darker spots. Again, it doesn’t even approach the best work of Google, Huawei and Apple. When it comes to cameras, you generally get what you pay for, unless you’ve got the word ‘Pixel’ in your title.
That glitzy pop-up 20-megapixel selfie camera is a bit of a disappointment at first, producing weirdly soft and smudgy skin tones. Tap the little symbol and clear the horrible Beautify filters, however, and they turn out to be reasonably sharp.

Software – MIUI 12 is much improved, if still slightly cluttered
On the side of the Poco F2 Pro’s box, you’ll find printed the words “With easy access to the Google apps you use most”. A cheeky dig at local rival Huawei, perhaps?
Whatever the case, this is hardly a haven for Google users. By default, most of Google’s apps are crammed into their own folder on the home screen. It’s surrounded by Xiaomi apps such as Gallery, File Manager, Themes, Cleaner, Music, Mi Video, Weather, Notes, Mi Store, and Mi Community, as well as the third party Opera web browser.
You also get a folder filled with a handful of terrible games, and one filled with occasionally useful Tools. And don’t forget the folder marked ‘More apps’, which contains preinstalled third-party apps like Facebook and Netflix.

Bloatware aside, Xiaomi’s take on Android 10 is actually pretty nice to use. A few days into the review, the MIUI 12 update came along, and it’s a definite improvement over what came before.
Besides a slightly tighter, tidier and more visually appealing design, you get new split notification and control centre menus in a blatant but successful crib from iOS. You also get the ability to turn notifications into floating windows that partially expand over whatever you’re doing.
Enhanced privacy protection is another part of the MIUI 12 package, making you more aware of the information you’re sharing. And the new animated Super wallpapers are an undeniably classy touch.

Google’s Feed is the swipe-left option from the home screen and this is the best way of doing things. No dodgy assemblage of recommended apps and ugly news feeds here.

Battery Life – Two-day capacity and a zippy fast charger
The Poco F2 Pro certainly means business when it comes to stamina. With a 4,700mAh battery, it’s clearly setting its sights on the budget-conscious power users out there.
On light to moderate days, I would frequently turn in with 50% or so left in the tank, pointing to a phone that can handle two full days on a single charge if you’re careful.
On more active days, where use was more intensive – generally involving a bunch of photos, a couple of bouts of gaming, a whole lot of messaging and emailing, and plenty of web browsing – that figure would drop into the 30s. But that should be enough to inspire confidence in all but the heaviest of smartphone users.

When it comes to media consumption, an hour of solid Netflix streaming with the screen brightness set to half sapped 9% of the remaining charge. That’s a solid result, and certainly comparable with other phones in this price range like the OnePlus Nord.
Xiaomi has bundled in a fast 30W charger with the F2 Pro, which is reasonably snappy at getting you back up and running. I plugged it in with just 19% left in the tank, and it powered up to 48% after 15 minutes. After half an hour that figure had risen to 66%, and 45 minutes got us to 84%.
Should you buy the Poco F2 Pro?
The Poco F2 Pro offers a notable step up in quality from the beloved Pocophone F1, with a more premium (if hefty) design and an ostensibly more advanced camera added to a high-quality processor.
And it’s the phone’s combination of top-end performance and price that makes it one of the best mid-range phones around. If you tend to find the step down in performance provided by most sub-£500 phones unpalatable, this could be the handset for you.
You can get a better camera, cleaner software, and a more fluid display for a little less money in the likes of the OnePlus Nord and the Pixel 4a. But not all together in the same phone, and not with a flagship CPU driving things along.
In terms of pound for pound value, the Poco F2 Pro is capable of making quite a few lesser flagships look a little silly.
Whether it warrants its Pro moniker or not, the Poco F2 Pro is a deeply compelling mid-range handset. There aren’t many phones that offer this level of performance at such a competitive price.

The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra cements Samsung’s place as one of the best phone makers in the world delivering a stunning display, great camera and a wealth of S Pen productivity perks



Pros
Bronze colour is really nice, and adds a matte finishS Pen even more responsive than everReally good triple camera

Cons

The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is here, and it’s a phone with so much going on – some of it works, other parts don’t.
If any phone was deserving of the term super flagship, then the Note 20 Ultra is that phone. Everything here is amped up, from the screen to the camera. Or at least, it is on paper.
The price is amped up too and this is one expensive device, though it seems far better value when compared to the severely lacking Galaxy Note 20.

Here’s everything we know about the Samsung Galaxy S21

But, has Samsung done enough to make this its best phone of the year? Or is the S20 series still the go-to choice? There’s also 2021’s Galaxy S21 range to consider now. If you love the Note series, the S21 Ultra with its 120Hz refresh rate and S-Pen support is the one the watch. Keep an eye on Trusted Reviews to see our review when it goes live.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra will come in three colours (Mystic Bronze, Mystic Black and Mystic White), with prices starting from £1179. There are a number of pre-order incentives, including free Galaxy Buds Live.
You can pre-order now with the release date on August 21.

Battery life and screen – The big talking points for the Note 20 Ultra
It’s very rare that we’d ever kick off a review talking about battery life, but for a modern phone like this, exactly how long it lasts is intrinsically linked to the display.
The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the first phone I have used that packs a variable refresh rate screen, speeding things up to 120Hz when scrolling or playing compatible games and then dialling it down to as low as 1Hz when you’re reading something static. There have been lots of 120Hz phones this year, but they all stay at that high level all the time, even when zero benefit is offered.
By reducing the refresh rate at certain times the display has less work to do, and should result in better battery life. Or at least that’s the idea…
I’ve been using the Note 20 Ultra for the past 10 days, a surprisingly extended period to get a good idea of how long the battery lasts and whether the new screen actually makes much of a difference. First off, you can’t tell when the screen changes refresh rates and it’s incredibly smooth all the time. Secondly, you still can’t have it set to 120Hz and WQHD+ at the same time – if you want the smoothness you’ll have to make do with FHD+. This is such a shame and while the 1080p resolution is great, when you pay this much for a phone you want to use everything to its fullest.
I’ve been just about getting through a day with the Note 20 Ultra, but I wouldn’t say battery life is great. An average of 5-6 hours of screen-on time (with some days even down to as low as 3-4) isn’t up there with the best and you won’t be pushing multiple days unless you’re using it sparingly. Of course, there are ways to get more from a charge. Lower the screen brightness, lower the resolution or stick to 60Hz – but who wants to do that? That’s not what the Note series is about.
Maybe the battery life isn’t that much of a surprise, especially when you consider the battery is notably smaller than the cell inside the Galaxy S20 Ultra at 4500mAh. My review unit is also powered by the Exynos 990, rather than the Snapdragon 865+ North America gets, and these Exynos phones tend to perform worse when it comes to endurance than the Qualcomm counterparts.
Interestingly, Samsung has removed support for 45w charging, citing lack of demand for its sold separately charger. Instead, charging tops out at 25w and a full charge takes about 90 minutes (or 80 with the phone turned off). 15w wireless charging is supported too if you have a capable Qi pad.
Still, the large 6.9-inch Super AMOLED display itself is excellent. It’s ridiculously bright to the point where using it outdoors on a sunny day is a doddle. It’s also the most capable phone I have tried yet at playing HDR content, with a real noticeable difference over SDR. Colours are rich, blacks deep and viewing angles only marginally affected by the sloping sides.

Design – Samsung is back to its best
After something of design blunder with the dull Galaxy S20 Ultra, Samsung is back to its best with the stunning Note 20 Ultra. I’ve been using the Mystic Bronze model and it’s immediately one of my favourite phone hues. It’s not gaudy like other golds, has a slightly darker tint on the (huge) camera bump to offer contrast and extends to the S Pen too. Picking up the bronze version also gets you a smooth matte finish on the back, rather than a glossy one. If you go with the black hue though you will still have a glossy rear.
I’ve always preferred the look of the Note to the S series. It has a far boxier, squared-off look that remains very distinctive.
The large camera bump is likely to cause plenty of debate – but I like it. The rectangular hump houses three cameras, a new autofocus model and flash, and it does stick out a fair bit. If you like typing when your phone is on the table then prepare for a lot of bouncing around.
The Note 20 Ultra is a big phone, even when compared to other big phones like the iPhone 11 Pro Max. It actually made me pick up the iPhone and think it was small – which it certainly isn’t.
This is par-for-the-course with Note phones and one of its distinctive traits. It’s weighty too, though the curved back helps it rests nicely in your hand. There’s a USB-C port on the bottom, the S Pen has switched sides from its traditional spot and there’s a SIM/expandable slot on the top. An IP68 rating for water resistance remains.

Performance and S Pen – Is the UK getting a duff deal with the Exynos 990?
A lot of people get very annoyed about the differences between the UK and North American Note devices. Here in the UK Samsung ships its phones with its own Exynos chipsets, while the other regions get the usually superior Snapdragon model.
It’s the same here, with my version powered by the same Exynos 990 as the S20 series, while the North American version ships with the newer, and faster, Snapdragon 865+. I know Samsung wants to keep selling phones with its own chips, but this is an odd way of doing it.
Aside from the battery issues mentioned above, the Exynos 990 is still very fast – but then I don’t have the 865+ to compare. This Note 20 Ultra benchmarks similarly to the S20 series and performance feels very similar – everything is quick to open, games play fantastically well even on the highest settings and multitasking is smooth thanks to the 12GB of fast RAM.
The S Pen has always been the thing that made a Note phone a Note phone. The stylus is better than ever here, with latency cut from over 40 to 9ms to make it super smooth responsive. I’ve also found the S Pen to be something of a gimmick: I’d use it a bit, then forget it was there. The screen, to me, still feels too small for meaningful drawing or note-taking and the Air Gestures are more faff than they should be. But, I know people who love the S Pen and for those the benefits here will make this a fantastic upgrade.
Samsung has improved many of the surrounding aspects of the pen too, with the dedicated Notes app now (finally) allowing you to sync your jots and doodles with other services thanks to Office 365.
This is a 5G phone, supporting all the versions of 5G across the globe, along with the usual array of 4G, 3G etc networks. Call quality is excellent and the speakers are good too, with sound coming from both the top and bottom. Samsung has also stuck with the same in-display fingerprint scanner as the S20 series. It’s fine, but not as fast as a capacitive sensor.
There are a couple of big software tweaks here, though the base One UI is similar to that of the Galaxy S20 and Note 10. Samsung has a partnership with Microsoft for some exclusive Game Pass Ultimate game streaming features like buying DLC, however this doesn’t officially launch until mid-September. Paired with a controller and 5G, I can see this being an excellent on-the-go gaming phone.
DeX can now be used wirelessly if you have a Miracast enabled casting device. This is Samsung’s desktop-like interface that turns the phone into more of a PC and now you don’t need cables to make use of it.
While Samsung’s software has improved immeasurably over the past few iterations, it’s still cramped with dual services. There’s a lot of preinstalled Microsoft apps, plus Samsung’s own browser and so many duplicate apps. Two clocks, two calculators, two app stores – it’s all a bit ridiculous.

Camera – The Note 20 Ultra is a huge improvement over the S20 Ultra
The camera system here is very capable and if you’re a fan of Samsung’s rich colours, detailed images and social-media friendly look then you’ll feel right at home. With the addition of the new focussing sensor, the biggest issue from the Galaxy S20 Ultra has been resolved.
You’ll take the majority of your snaps with the main 108-megapixel sensor which, by default, brings multiple pixels together to give you brighter 12-megapixel images. Or you can shoot at the full 108-megapixel resolution – just don’t expect these to be easily shareable due to their large sizes.
Images are so colourful, with punchy blues and saturated hues that pop off the ridiculously bright display. Pretty much every picture I took, whether in bright conditions or in lower-light environments was usable and the new focussing sensor locks on to targets very quickly. Dynamic range is excellent, with a strong difference between the lightest and darkest points, and you can have nice silky, natural bokeh even without using the Live Focus mode.
Speaking of modes, there’s a lot going on here. Single Take bunches pictures and video together to create short gifs and there’s AR and Bixby features aplenty. There is a dedicated Night mode, but I found this to fall short of similar modes you’ll find on Huawei, Apple and Google phones. Still, it’s there if you want to inject your bar shots with extra light.
There’s also both a 12MP ultra wide and a 12MP telephoto with some clever periscope glass over it that allows for very good 5x optical zoom. Samsung has done a great job at matching the colours between all three camera sensors, meaning whichever focal length you choose there’s a sense that they’re all coming from the same place.
Samsung has ditched the wild 100x zoom from the S20 Ultra and it now maxes out at 50x, which should only be used to show off how far your phone can zoom. Stick to the optical 5x and you’ll get truly excellent zoom shots that don’t have any of the usual artifacting you’d find with digital zoom. The 10MP front camera is great too.
Whether this is the best camera phone out there really comes down to your personal preferences. For me, I still prefer the slightly less bombastic colours you’ll get with a Pixel or iPhone 11 Pro – but the secondary cameras are far better here, so you’ll see variety in the types of shots you can get.
My only real qualm is the amount of haloing you get around straight lines. Take a picture of a building and they’ll always be an unsightly white line around details when you zoom in. You likely won’t notice it until you look for it, but then it’s hard to ignore.
The video recording features are excellent on the Note 20 Ultra, with ‘cinematic’ 8K 24fps showing just how good these phones have become at capturing footage. If you lower the resolution you’ll get handy extras like focus tracking.

Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra?
The Note 20 Ultra is big, brash and expensive with specs for days and a bevy of inventive additions that show Samsung remains up there with the best when it comes to Android phones. The camera is great, the S Pen much improved and the screen a joy. This is the full-on Note experience, amped up to 11.
But, there are issues. Battery life is far from great and being forced to sacrifice resolution for smoothness is a shame – even if this would affect the battery even further. The UK not getting the Snapdragon version also means there’s no noticeable speed or graphics boosts over the S20 series.
Still, if it’s the S Pen and huge screen you’re after then the Note 20 Ultra is for you.",trustedreviews,https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/galaxy-note-20-ultra

The Realme X50 5G is one of the boldest mobile phones statements of 2020. It’s a sub-£300 phone with 5G. And it significantly undercuts the OnePlus Nord, which already seemed a bargain.
That’s your two-sentence sell. But the Realme X50 5G also offers a whole stack of other benefits over the many other excellent phones at £200-300.
It has a glass back, not a plastic one. The screen is a 120Hz display with wide colour gamut support. And the main camera is significantly better at night than most of the competition, and not too far off the Google Pixel 4a.
The Realme X50 5G is a colossal bargain, and while some slightly cheaper phones have much larger batteries, it even outlasts almost all flagships phones off a charge. Finding things seriously wrong with this phone, at £300, is not easy.

Design – The Realme X50 5G feels great to hold
There are two important elements to the Realme X50 5G’s design that separate it from other phones around this price. One is good, one not so good.
Let’s start with the positive one. The Realme X50 5G has a curved Gorilla Glass back.
A few years ago this would have been pretty normal for a £300 phone, but it is becoming increasingly rare. Even the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 has a plastic back, a phone almost three times the price.

Some think this doesn’t matter. Plastic won’t shatter like glass, and if you have a silicone case on, which I’d recommend, you won’t notice anyway.
Fair enough. But phones are made of metal and glass for a reason. They feel nicer, and their relative hardness makes them much less likely to pick up scratches and scuffs from light contact.

That’s the crucial “good bit” done. The bad part is that the Realme X50 5G does not have a headphone jack, most likely because it wants to be seen as a high-end phone.
However, this is still an obvious choice for someone who wants a good upgrade but doesn’t want to spend stacks of cash, on fancy wireless headphones for example. And I love being able to use the pair of Sennheiser Momentum wired headphones I’ve owned for years.

The rest of the Realme X50 5G is fairly similar to the many phones available at the price, or slightly less. It’s a large-screen phone so is not a petite pocket rocket like the Google Pixel 4a.
Its sides are plastic rather than aluminium, just like the OnePlus Nord’s, and it is not waterproof.
The camera housing on the back is better-looking than some, but there is a stack of phones that look and feel quite similar to this one. I am a big fan of its fingerprint scanner, though.

It’s side-mounted, doubles as the power button, and is extremely quick. You can choose whether it unlocks with a light touch or a proper press too. I use the press, and it’s quick enough to make you forget any finger scanning is even going on in the background.
Screen – 120Hz at this price is fantastic
This finger scanner and the 120Hz screen have a big part in making the Realme X50 5G feel as snappy as it does.
Fitting in a 120Hz screen is a remarkable stretch at the price, and makes scrolling through Android’s app drawer feel more fluid. Even if those apps are scrolling by at the same pace, the perception is the Realme X50 5G is faster than the 60Hz rivals.
I was not a high refresh rate convert at first when such phones popped up in 2019. I’d rather see my films at 24fps, and I think additional processor headroom in games is better spent on improved texture quality and detail than ultra-high frame rates. But 120Hz at £299? I’m all in.

The Realme X50 5G does not have as immediate display “pop” as the OLED Samsung Galaxy M31. But it is otherwise a technically superior display in several respects beyond refresh rate.
The Realme X50 5G supports HDR, for example, and wide gamut colours. Almost all sub-£300 phones do not, including the OLED Samsung Galaxy M31.
Outdoors brightness is good, if predictably not as powerful as a true high-end phone. And as the Realme X50 5G has two front cameras than one, there’s a larger punch hole. Still, 16:9 videos don’t get close to reaching the cut-out unless you crop the frame, so it doesn’t matter too much.
The Realme X50 5G also has one of the larger screens in its category, at 6.57 inches diagonal. This is bigger than the OnePlus’s Nord’s 6.4-incher, and much bigger than the Pixel 4a’s screen.
It’s good for games and media, if not quite ideal for your pocket. Don’t buy the X50 5G is you want a small phone.
Software and Performance – A winner across the board
The Realme X50 5G runs Android 10 and a custom interface called Realme UI. I made a few tweaks to it in the first five minutes of use.
First, it doesn’t use an app drawer by default. And I’ll always add the drawer back in if I can. You can do so here.

It also didn’t fit all that many app icons into each screen. You can tweak this too. These alterations applied, the Realme X50 5G seems as close to a clean and simple Android interface as any Moto G phone.
You can stray further too if you like. Realme UI offers a bunch of neat tweaks hidden in the settings menu, like the ability to change the shape of app icons, alter their size with fine-grain control and even play with the size of the graphic within the icon.

Experiment with this for a minute and suddenly the Realme X50 5G’s interface gains a whole different visual personality. I quickly returned to the default setting, though, because it already looks more tasteful than anything I could cook up.
The phone’s slinky transitions don’t change with these tweaks. And, once again, the Realme X50 5G’s 120Hz screen makes meaningful improvements to how the software comes across.
The Snapdragon 765G processor deserves much of the credit here. This is probably the single most important CPU in the effort to make 5G mainstream, so it’s no wonder Qualcomm may have made extra efforts to get this one right.
The general performance it provides is excellent, and Fortnite shows the significant benefits it offers over something like the Snapdragon 665. That’s the Qualcomm chipset you’re most likely to get if you spend just slightly less.
You can play Fortnite at Epic graphics with the resolution slider set to max fairly comfortably. It does not stay at 30fps, with frequent drops to 25fps, but this is still much better than many. Phones with the Snapdragon 665 and Exynos 9611 CPUs tend to hover around 20fps with the graphics lowered.
This is yet another example of why the Snapdragon 765G CPU sits in such a tasty sweet spot. You can play all current high-end games at their top settings without making them too stuttery.

I recorded slightly poorer benchmarks results with the Realme X50 5G than the OnePlus Nord. It scores 1832 (595 per core) in Geekbench 5, to the Nord’s 1940 (606 per core).
Speaker quality is similar too. The Realme X5 5G has good sound projection and volume, and enough mid-range substance to make voices sound good. However, you only get a single driver on the bottom.
Camera – Quad cameras in cheaper phones have become a box-ticking obsession
Did I miss a memo? For some reason, almost every single affordable phone that isn’t outright cheap now has to have four cameras on the back.
And almost every single time 50 per cent of those cameras are largely pointless. The Motorola Moto G8 Power is one notable exception, as it has a reasonably useful 2x zoom camera.

However, it’s happened again with the Realme X50 5G. The phone has a main 48-megapixel camera, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide, and two 2-megapixel sensors used for dreadful undersaturated macro images and to help the background blur of the Portrait mode.
Realme might as well use the wide for this parallax-calculating purpose, given how low-quality the depth sensor is. There’s no zoom, and while you can zoom in to up to 5x, I’d avoid the 2x and 5x if you can. They just use digital zooming, which does not look great.
Quad cameras in cheaper phones have become a weird box-ticking obsession. But there is some good news.
The Realme X50 5G has one of the best primary cameras you can get at the price, even if it won’t quite match the Google Pixel 4a.
I put it up against the Moto G8 Power, Xiaomi Redmi Note 9, Oppo A72, Samsung Galaxy M31, TCL 10L and OnePlus Nord to see how it compares.
In daylight it is only matched by the Nord. Its images are bright and punchy without overexposure, there’s plenty of shadow detail and image sharpening is not too aggressive.    The Portrait mode can blur out the background of standard shots as well as those of people

Low-light photos are surprisingly good, as long as you use the Realme X50 5G’s Night mode. This usually takes 2-3 seconds to capture an image, and creates a single image out of several merged exposures.
It dramatically improves dynamic range, bringing out the cloud contours of moonlit skies very well, more so than almost any other phone below £300.

The Realme Night mode is one of the best at the price. It yields great results.

The ultra-wide camera is, as ever, a useful and welcome add-on. But like every phone in this category, the hardware is a step down in quality from the primary camera.
It’s an 8-megapixel sensor with a lens that is prone to purple fringing in well-lit scenes. However, there’s still plenty to like. You can use the Night mode with the ultra-wide and it has great lens distortion correction, so your shots don’t have the characteristic “bent” look of a fisheye lens.
Here’s a good example, where the geometry of the scene looks straight even shot wide.
Non-wide

Wide
This comparison also shows the wide camera’s limits. Dynamic range is lower, colour is less refined and there are a lot of unwanted purple tones when you look up close. Still, the wide also makes it much easier to capture photos of looming buildings, like this:

Lens correction makes the buildings look straight, not curved, but it can’t quite fix the distortion of the figures in the image’s corners.
There are a few compromises on the video side, but nothing alarming. The Realme X50 5G can shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second, but not the 60fps it can capture at 1080p. You lose electronic stabilisation at 4K too, so you’ll often be better of sticking too Full HD anyway.
The phone also has a super stable mode, which uses the ultra-wide sensor and an extreme crop for extra electronic stabilisation power. It’s handy, but only use it if you want to capture mountain bike rides or something similar. Video quality is significantly worse when using Ultra Stable.
Still, this is the case with every phone that has this feature, including ones three times the price.
The Realme X50 5G has two front cameras. There’s a 16-megapixel main sensor and a simple 2-megapixel camera used to let you blur out the background in your selfies.
I may not like the depth camera on the back, but this one justifies itself as most phones at the price don’t let you blur the background in selfies. Image quality is very good at the price. You’ll see good detail in well-lit rooms, and the image integrity holds up better in low light than most phones at £200-300.
Battery Life – The Realme X50 5G can take a full day of fairly heavy use
The Realme X50 5G has a 4200mAh battery. This is smaller than several of the cheaper alternatives.
There’s a slew of 5000mAh phones available at £200-300, like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9, Motorola Moto G8 Power and Oppo A72. Samsung is the surprise king of battery life at the price. Its Galaxy M31 has a huge 6000mAh battery.
However, I’m more than happy with how the Realme X50 5G lasts. It can take a full day of fairly heavy use, and actually performs better than expected given its capacity. I have never worried about it running out, and on a light day it may even finish up with 40-50% charge left.

It outlasts the OnePlus Nord, based on my anecdotal experience. This doesn’t make a great deal of sense if you look at the numbers. The Nord has a significantly smaller screen and only marginally lower battery capacity (4115mAh). Both phones lose 8% charge after streaming a 90 minute movie over Wi-Fi too.
This suggests the Realme X50 5G is likely more restrictive in its handling of background processes, curtailing all but the essentials. You could argue this means its 6GB RAM is a little wasted, as it allows for faster hopping between parked apps, but notifications never seemed slow to appear. And that ultra-reliable real-world stamina is actually closer to what I’d expect from a 5000mAh phone.
The Realme X50 5G also has great charging. It uses Oppo’s Dash charging system, with power output of up to 30W.
Should you buy the Realme X50 5G?
The Realme X50 5G is one of the best mobile deals of 2020. It has 5G, a large 120Hz screen, a very competent processor, fast charging and good general camera performance for £300.
A whole bunch of slightly cheaper phones last even longer off a charge. And, like almost every quad-camera phones at the price, you get one good camera, one so-so one and two duds.
However, at this point Realme likely feels obligated to include the “filler” lenses to avoid seeming less fully-featured than cheaper rivals.
Should you upgrade to the OnePlus Nord or Pixel 4a? The OnePlus has a cuter design, a slightly smaller OLED screen and an in-screen fingerprint scanner. Consider the switch if you want something smaller.
The Pixel 4a is smaller still, but the camera is the real reason to buy. While the Realme is a great performer at its price in almost all conditions, the Pixel 4a’s processing is of the class above.
Want the most tech for the least cash? Buy the Realme X50 5G.

Verdict





























 



It’s hard to argue with the OnePlus Nord’s value proposition and this once again begs the questions of why you’d pay more for a phone anymore. This could easily be a five-star device if it had a true standout feature, but it’s still easy to recommend as one of the best cheap phones around.



Pros

Great quality OLED panel
Very quick charging
Lovely version of Android
Nice, ergonomic design
5G and great performance



Cons

Screen seems to mark very easily
Secondary cameras are pretty much useless

The OnePlus Nord is the brand’s cheapest phone currently available and it manages to hit that low price without skimping on features. 
OnePlus hyped its return to making more affordable smartphones in the same way it does for its flagship. A constant slew of pre-release YouTube hands on, drip-feeding of details and well-produced videos were available even before we knew exactly what was going on with this £379 device.
After using the Nord for an extended period it’s clear that, hype aside, this is a strong phone that comfortably achieves what most people want from a handset. It might not be available in North America (yet), have the stunning camera of the Google Pixel 4a or the sub-£300 price of the Moto G 5G Plus, but this is still easily one of the best affordable phones you can buy.
Screen and Design – There are cutbacks, but the OnePlus still looks great
What OnePlus has managed to do with the Nord is make a ‘cheap’ phone that doesn’t have any obvious setbacks. Yes, you do miss luxuries like an IP rating, Qi charging and high-end materials, but after using the Nord I don’t find myself missing them.
The build, for example, is largely plastic, rather than metal, and I first thought this would make it feel cheap. But it doesn’t; this is a comfortable phone to grip thanks to ergonomically curved sides and you’ve still got a glass back. The plastic sides even look like metal, and I doubt many would notice the difference if they didn’t know.
OnePlus hasn’t made any drastic changes to the size of the phone and while it’s slightly smaller than the OnePlus 8, it’s still a fairly big phone.

Along one side you have got the super-useful alert slider for quickly switching to silent and a power key, while the other side has a slightly mushy volume rocker. There are a USB-C port and a single pretty poor mono speaker on the bottom and nothing more than a mic on top. The reintroduction of the headphone port is something still mostly expected at this price, and it would have been nice to have it here.
While there is no actual IP rating, OnePlus has kept the seals protecting the SIM slot so you should be ok if you accidentally drop the phone in the bath – something I definitely did not do.
The front is covered by a flat 6.44-inch display with an oblong cutout for the dual selfie cameras. This is among the best displays you’ll find at this price thanks to the quality OLED panel, decent peak brightness and sharp FHD+ resolution. It can also playback HDR video, however the effect isn’t very successful. That’s fine though and really you’ll only see worthy mobile HDR on brighter screens than this.
OnePlus has a lot of nice screen customisation options too and I tend to always switch to the P3 colour gamut to get a more cinematic colour space. You can choose a more vivid option if that’s more to your taste, or tweak it to be warmer or cooler.
The alert slider remains
Like the OnePlus 8, the screen here refreshes at 90hz giving it a far smoother look when scrolling compared to a 60Hz phone – the Pixel 4a, for example. There’s also a fairly quick and accurate in-display fingerprint scanner for secure unlocking. 
My one big issue with the display is that, if you remove the bundled screen protector, it marks far too easily. I’d invest in a proper screen protector if you buy the Nord.
Performance – The OnePlus Nord performs like a flagship
One of my biggest takeaways so far with phones in 2020 is that a truly ‘flagship’ chipset probably isn’t that important anymore. Inside the OnePlus Nord you’ll find the Snapdragon 765G, a chipset that powers a whole range of phones ranging in price from £300 to £700.
This might not have the benchmark scores of an 865, however nothing I have tried seems to slow this phone down. Bouts of PUBG, Call of Duty Mobile and taxing games play without a hitch or dropped frame rate and everything feels smooth and fluid when you’re doing daily tasks. The 90hz display certainly does help in this regard.
Related: Best phone
The snappy multitasking is likely helped a lot by the sizeable amounts of RAM, which in the UK is either 8GB or 12GB. In India there’s also a 6GB option too. Storage isn’t skimped on either, with 128GB and 256GB flavours.
Another benefit of the Snapdragon 765G chipset is the 5G support, at least in its sub-6 variety (the only current standard used in the UK). If you’re on a 5G contract and in a 5G area then you’ll get faster speeds here than you would on 4G. 5G isn’t a deal-breaker for a phone yet, but it’s great to have and really does future-proof the Nord.
Sometimes it’s the little things that aren’t quite as good on cheaper phones, and that’s obvious here. The vibration motor is poor and I often struggled to feel it vibrating in my pocket while the speaker is easily blocked. Call quality is perfectly adequate, though.
The software here is great
Software – OxygenOS is a winner of an Android interface
It’s great to see OnePlus promising multi-years of updates for Nord, something you’re never guaranteed to get with cheaper phones – unless you go for the Pixel 4a. I’m less enamoured with the backend Facebook framework that seems to be pre-installed on the Nord.
That aside, the Oxygen OS that is laid over the top of Android 10 is great. Lots of customisations (accent colours, gestures) and a heavy reliance on Google’s own apps and services. OnePlus has removed its Shelf screen, replacing it with Google’s home screen view. If you’re a fan of the Shelf you can add it back, with a swipe down from the home screen.
Classic OnePlus features are still here, so you’re not losing much by not spending big on the 8 Pro. The excellent reading mode turns everything greyscale and is so good when reading on the Kindle app, while Zen mode forces you put the phone down.
This remains one of my favourite versions of Android.
Battery life – Warp Charge 30T is great on such an affordable phone
While the battery life on OnePlus Nord isn’t world-beating or on par with the Moto G 5G Plus, the super-quick Warp Charge 30T gives you a full charge in little over an hour. Even if you forget to charge it overnight, a quick top-up while you’re having a shower will get you comfortably through the next few hours.
Four hours of screen on time has been my average throughout my time with the OnePlus Nord and its 4115mAh cell, which should lead to comfortably day-long endurance for most users. An hour of Netflix ate through 10% which is a fair result.
You’ll find four cameras on the back (and two on the front)
Camera – There are a lot of cameras on the Nord, but are they good?
It might pluck the same main sensor from the OnePlus 8, but considering that was a pretty poor smartphone shooter my hopes weren’t high for the OnePlus Nord’s camera. Thankfully my expectations are lower at this price and the Nord does take good pictures, with nice colours and plenty of sharpness.
Snaps from the main 48-megapixel f/1.8 OIS-enabled camera are pleasing on the eye and if the conditions aren’t too harsh you wouldn’t be surprised if they came from a pricier phone. Introduce some tougher elements and the HDR functionality struggles to cope, this is especially noticeable if you’re shooting on searingly sunny days where the exposure levels are all off.
Well lit shots look great with lots of detail
Though not all shots, especially those in tougher situations, look good
It’s also unlucky for OnePlus that the Nord came out very close to the Pixel 4a, which beats it so very obviously in just about every area. While the Pixel 4a handles tough situations with ease, the Nord falls behind. Of course, the Pixel 4a is the outlier at this price and the Nord competes far better with the other choices.
There’s a night mode that brightens up dark shots to a point where they’re usable and the camera app is simple to use and packed with nice-to-have features like a pro mode and Google Lens integration.
While the night mode brightens stuff up a lot (this was in a dark room) the results are far from ideal
The other three cameras feel like they are there so OnePlus can call this quad-camera phone, as none of them produces much of note. The 8-megapixel ultra wide is the best of the bunch, with its wider focal view letting you cram more in. Results are a bit soft, even if the colours are still nice.
Related: Best mid-range phones
The 2MP macro and 5MP depth sensors are useless and if ditching them could have allowed for something like wireless charging or even a mildly better speaker then it would have been worth it.
There’s another two cameras on the front: a 32MP main and 8MP ultra wide. Having a wider selfie camera is great, letting you get more people without stretching for arm further away.
Video tops out at 4k30fps and looks pretty good actually, with nice stable footage and good colour reproduction.
Should you buy the OnePlus Nord?
It’s hard to argue with the OnePlus Nord’s value proposition and this once again begs the question of why you’d pay more for a phone anymore. This could easily be a five-star device if it had a true standout feature, but it’s still easy to recommend as one of the best cheap phones around.

And our OnePlus 8 review

If you want a better camera, go with the Pixel 4a, and if you want multi-day battery life then opt for the Moto G 5G Plus; for everything else though, the Nord is a very strong choice.

Verdict



































If you’re after a small, affordable Android phone (£349/$349) with a nice screen, future proof software that’ll receive big updates for the next three years and a fantastically reliable camera then you’re not going to be disappointed with the Pixel 4a.



Pros
Great cameraRefreshingly small size for an Android phoneThe promise of fast updatesNice, sharp OLED screenAffordable

Cons
You’ll find competition with far larger spec sheets and feature listsSome mild performance and touch latency hiccupsAs well as being a Pro, the small screen might put some off

The Pixel 4a is finally here and it’s pretty much exactly what we expected based off past leaks, which is no bad thing.
If there’s one word that can describe the Pixel 4a it is ‘predictable’. The phone’s a mild upgrade on the Pixel 3a that brings with it some welcome additions and a few missing features that make it feel a little old-school compared to the competing OnePlus Nord and Moto G 5G Plus.
While the Pixel 4a is never going to beat others on a spec-sheets, it does offer itself as a unique Android rival to the iPhone SE 2 that is an absolute pleasure to use.
This is a small phone that hits a sweet spot that’s been untapped in Android for quite some time. It also impresses with its camera – usually the most obvious negative on a phone this price. 
Google is expected to launch the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro later this year, so be sure to check out our guides to find out what could be in store before you shop. 
Price and release date – How much is the Pixel 4a and when can you buy it?
There’s one model of the Pixel 4a with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. It’ll retail for £349 in the UK and $349 in the US.
Design and Screen – The small phone Android needed
There is no XL version of the Pixel 4a so it comes in one fixed 5.8-inch size. That makes it one of the smaller best Android phones available and while I know some will bemoan the lack of a larger screen, it’s hard to deny that there’s currently a shortage of small Google phones
This is a phone you could, if you want, use with one hand without feeling like you’re going to drop it. It’s very light too, which is a blessing and meant using it for the past week has been refreshing, especially after coming off the very tall Moto G 5G Plus.
That being said, there have been times I wished I had the option of a bigger XL version. The keyboard can feel incredibly tightly packed at times and it’s not the ideal size for gaming or watching videos. 
Pixel phones have never been flashy and I have praised the subtle, well thought out designs Google has used in the past. The Pixel 4a follows this trend, almost to its detriment. This is a very basic looking phone that comes in a single matte black finish.

 Pixel 4a vs OnePlus Nord


Its constructed from tough, grippy plastic with rounded edges and very little else of note. There’s a new square camera housing and a capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back, along with a single pop of colour in the form of a minty power button.
It’s a perfectly serviceable design, but one that edges on being boring. There is no bright colour option like we had with the Pixel 4 and a complete lack of flair or small details that could help it stand out.
You also miss out on an IP rating – a feature you’ll find on the iPhone SE 2 and something that could have helped the Pixel 4a offer something other cheaper Androids don’t.
At least there’s a headphone port on the top for all those pairs of 3.5mm headphones you’ve likely still got laying around.
The front of the Pixel 4a is covered in a 5.8-inch OLED display and it’s the first Google phone with a cutout camera perched in the top left corner. This gives it a much more full-screen look when compared to the Pixel 4 and the dual stereo speakers have also managed to stick around.
The display itself is strong, even if it lacks the faster 90Hz refresh rate that gives an extra hit of smoothness to phones like the OnePlus Nord and Realme X50 5G. It retains a 1080p resolution and the OLED panel gives it luscious deep blacks, nice punchy colours and HDR support in apps like Netflix and YouTube.

Performance and Software – The Pixel 4a isn’t a top performer, but it’s not far off
For the £349/$349 price, the Pixel 4a packs a good selection of internals. The main grunt comes from the Snapdragon 730 chipset, and that’s backed up by a good amount of RAM (6GB) and storage (128GB). Google has often skimped on RAM and storage before and it’s good to see the Pixel 4a actually shipping with double the base amount of storage and the same amount of memory as the Pixel 4.
What you do miss here, when compared to phones like the OnePlus Nord and Moto G 5G Plus which run on the Snapdragon 765G, is 5G. Whether or not this will be an issue will come down to your personal situation. I don’t think 5G is widespread enough yet to be a must for a new phone, especially ones that are at this end of the market, but, having it would have made the Pixel 4a more futureproof and, in my opinion, more appealing.
In my week with the phone I have found performance to be good, with the usual caveats that come with a mid-tier chipset. Mostly things are smooth, from opening to apps and scrolling through sites and playing basic games, however there is the odd glitch or hiccup that stands out. I have found the touch response to be a bit off, with it having a generally less responsive feel than I would usually expect from a Pixel. 
Apps take a moment or two longer to open than on the Pixel 4 and more-intensive games (Call of Duty, Asphalt 9 etc) aren’t as smooth. Do any of these things make much difference after a few days? For me, no. Interestingly, no benchmarking apps ran properly on the phone so I have left these results out. This will likely change when the phone gets announced and becomes available. 
There are lots of other performance highlights too. The front-firing speakers are loud, the vibration motor easily beats out the competition and call quality is excellent.
Google once again sells a Pixel phone with a strong focus on software. The version of Android 10 (which will likely be updated to Android 11 very soon after release, if not by release) mimics the Pixel 4, with its selection of AI-tweaked additions. The voice recorder app, for instance, transcribes text ridiculously accurately and there’s live captioning available across the entire OS. Of course, these features are available elsewhere now, but they came first to Pixel phones and you’ll be first in line for the next load of tweaks and changes.

While I do love the cleanness and overall design of the Pixel Launcher, I do miss some of the features that have become commonplace among other Android phones. You can’t, for instance, stretch video apps out to cover the cutout camera. The battery saver modes are also weak and it just lacks the customisability of Oxygen OS. Another shame is the lack of even a rudimentary form of facial unlocking, forcing you to always use the fingerprint scanner for unlocking.
Still, with Google promising three years of version updates for the Pixel 4a, plus likely access to the betas, this is a great choice if you want the best new Android features.
Camera – Pixel 4a offers the best photos at this price, and then some
The Pixel 4a is the best camera phone you’ll find at this price, and then some. It’s even better than some flagship phones I have reviewed that come close to £/$1000. This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise if you’ve ever used or heard about Pixels before.
The single 12-megapixel f/1.7 sensor on the back of the Pixel 4a lacks the versatility you’ll find on multi-sensor arrays, however it continues the Pixels dominance when it comes to picture processing and low-light shooting.
You’ll find most phones can take great daylight pictures if the lighting is good and there’s nothing ‘getting in the way’. With the Pixel 4a, you can shoot in much more challenging conditions and the Live HDR+ does all the hard work. I took the phone out shooting on a very bright day and it managed to pull great shots out even with the sun getting it in the way. It doesn’t overexpose and the colours it produces are more accurate than anything you’ll find on a competing phone this price.

There’s a great natural depth of field effect
Once again the trademark contrasty, high dynamic range pictures of the Pixel series are here. I still find the colours the most appealing out of any phone going. It captures the atmosphere of a sunset and the sheen from a car in a way other phones don’t.
Shots are also packed with detail, even when you get up close – see the shots of the flowers.

Low-light performance is another key area where the Pixel 4a’s camera shines. Like the Pixel 4, the 4a has a mode for shooting great snaps of a starry sky and a night mode that brings out far more brightness from low-light shots than you would ever expect.
The night shot mode pulls out brightness from night shots that even I can’t see and it does this with just a few moments of processing. Noise is kept to a minimum (though ever so slightly more obvious than the Pixel 4) and both detail and contrast is kept. See the samples below for an idea.



The video mode and the 8-megapixel front camera are also impressive. Video caps at 4K 30fps, but you benefit from excellent stabilisation and strong colours. Really it’s just impressive all round.
What you do miss when compared to the larger, pricier Pixel 4 is the zoom lens and some of the processing grunt that comes with the faster internals. Having only focal lenses isn’t an issue and after reviewing many phones with poor secondary cameras I would take a stellar main cam over useless backup ones any day.
Battery life – The Pixel 4a is better than the iPhone SE 2
Throughout my week with the Google Pixel 4a I have managed to get a full day from a single charge. I’ve been averaging four hours of screen on time, though often getting up to five and a half and sometimes dipping below three. 
I’ve come to expect smaller phones with smaller batteries to struggle when compared to larger devices, but that’s not really the case here. Though I would say this isn’t a two day phone unless you’re a really light user (or not taking any pictures).
There’s no wireless charging, but it does use the USB PD 18w standard so you’ll get a full charge in about 100 minutes. That’s not the fastest around, however you’re not restricted to using a proprietary cable and charging block. 10 minutes of charge will get you 20%, 30 minutes to 40% and 70% in just under an hour.



Should you buy it?


You’re looking for the best camera on a budget and small phones are your kind of thingIt might only have a single lens setup, but the Pixel 4a is easily the best camera phone you can buy at this price. It shoots well in all conditions, even low light, and the colours produced look wonderful.

Verdict





























 



For £299 (or £349 for the 6GB RAM version) you’re a getting an Android phone that easily matches handsets that cost twice the price. Performance is great, the software is clean and the screen is bright and fast. It charges up quickly and lasts for ages and it even takes pretty good photos. Add to that 5G and the new Moto G easily earns a place as one of 2020's best value smartphones. 



Pros

Unbelievable value
Sharp display
Great performance (for the price)
5G support
Fast charging and great battery life



Cons

A bit cheap feeling
The secondary cameras are mostly useless
Some software bugs

The Moto G 5G Plus is a fantastic device. It’s amazingly cheap and boasts a whole range of excellent features that help it outperform nearly every other £299 phone to arrive this year.
5G has been around in the UK for over a year now and while it’s yet to make its way to an iPhone, you can already find super-affordable Android phones sporting the next-gen connectivity tech.
Among those choices are the OnePlus Nord, Realme X50 5G and the Moto G 5G Plus – with the latter of the bunch arguably the most exciting.
The Moto G 5G Plus is a similar phone to Moto Edge, packing the same chipset and tall display, however it’s far cheaper and more accessible.
Moto G 5G Plus Performance and 5G – You probably don’t need anything more
The Snapdragon 765G is becoming everyone’s go-to chipset if you’re not shipping a full-on flagship with the top-end 865. We’ve seen it in phones sub-£600 and now it’s showing up in devices I’d properly class as ‘budget’. I’ve long believed that most people don’t need the added speed and graphics seen on top end chips. For the majority of smartphone users the 7-series is more than good enough– especially for a sub-£300 phone.
The Moto G 5G Plus is the smoothest and fastest Moto G phone I have used, and considering I have never felt these phones were slow that’s a big compliment. It’s on par with far pricier phones running the same chip, like the Moto Edge, and I would even say the performance is better, and far more reliable, than the LG Velvet. It’s a capable gaming device too, with titles like Call of Duty Mobile making use of the 21:9 tall display to give you more room. Gaming isn’t quite as snappy as on high-end phones, especially with graphically intense titles that really test the mid-range GPU, but if you’re after a gaming phone you probably know you’re going to spend more. 
My review unit is the model with 4GB RAM, though you can pay slightly more and up that to 6GB. Now, while I wouldn’t normally worry about RAM, 4GB feels like the least I would want in an Android phone now. I haven’t noticed anything untoward so far, aside from how quickly apps fall out of memory, however over time this could be one of the things holding it back. If I was to buy the phone I would plump for the 6GB model, just to have that extra headroom when multitasking.
Related: Best cheap phone
The biggest benefit to the chipset is its 5G modem. The Moto G 5G Plus works on the sub-6Ghz 5G network and gives you access to 5G (along with 4G, 3G etc) if you have the right SIM, plan and are in a 5G area. 5G isn’t overly widespread yet, but if you’ve got it the benefits are clear and 5G works just as well here than it does with any other phone I have tested.
Audio quality, on the other hand, isn’t the best. There’s one speaker on the bottom and while it is loud, it’s easy to cover with your hand when you’re watching landscape video. While it looks like there’s a secondary speaker on the top, this is just a mic for the voice calls – which are good quality.

At least you’ve got a 3.5mm headphone port on the bottom, next to the USB C charging point.
Motorola’s software is very much Android as Google intended it. The only additions over the very ‘stock’ launcher are handy Moto tweaks like quickly opening the camera with the twist or ‘chopping’ to turn the light on. You’ve also got the handy Moto Display that’ll bring up notifications when the screen is off. However, as we noted in our Moto Edge review, there are a few software bugs present here. Icons will sometimes become unresponsive, the phone rebooted itself a few times during the review period and sometimes I was met with a blank screen after unlocking, Hopefully these will be ironed out in a software update. 
Moto G 5G Plus Screen – 90Hz and HDR, bit its not OLED
You’d be forgiven for thinking Motorola would work hard to introduce 5G at a budget price and then forget to make a good phone around it. That’s far from the case, though.
Take the screen: this is a 21:9 (so very tall and narrow) LCD panel measuring 6.7-inches and with a 2520 x 1080 resolution. It’s bright, sharp, colourful and the wide aspect ratio makes it great for media. The screen is disrupted slightly by the duo of front cameras, however I do like how they’re separated – rather than stretched into one single pill box.
Like the Moto Edge, the display here refreshes at 90Hz, giving it a smoother look than previous Moto Gs which all have 60Hz panels. It also gives the Moto G 5G Plus a leg-up over the far pricier Oppo Find X2 Lite. It’s not the best interpretation of 90Hz I have used and it does very occasionally flicker, but again the price here will be affecting that.
Related: Best phone
The obvious downside is the use of an LCD panel rather than OLED (which you’ll find on the pricier OnePlus Nord). This means blacks are a little washed out. Motorola also says there should be HDR support, but, again, you need an OLED panel to make the most of this tech.
My other biggest qualm with the display is just how reflective it is. It seems to catch and reflect any light hitting it and I have found always using the display at its brightest setting even if the room I’m in isn’t that bright.

Moto G 5G Plus Design – The price compromises are most obvious here
The Moto G 5G Plus isn’t an ugly phone. Far from it. It’s just that it’s the one area where it feels like a £299 device.
It’s clad in thick, bulky plastic with a smudgey, greasy finish. My review unit has a blue hue and the back has this carbon fibre pattern underneath the plastic. It’s inoffensive, but I am not the biggest fan. Still, I have dropped it several times and there’s not a scratch or mark in sight. Phew. Sometimes a little less plastic and glass is a good thing.
The fast and reliable fingerprint sensor sits inside the physical lock switch on the side; there’s a headphone port on the bottom and even a dedicated Google Assistant key on the side. While I do like quick access to the Assistant, being able to customise this key to the camera would have been even more welcome.
If you’re looking for a small phone then you’re looking in the wrong place. While the G 5G Plus doesn’t look huge, the wide screen means it’s very tall and though it’s narrow enough to grip comfortably in one hand it’s a struggle navigating the UI without both hands.
An official water resistance rating misses the cut in making this cheap phone although Motorola does say it is splash resistant.

Moto G 5G Plus Camera – Six sensors, various outcomes
There are six cameras on the Moto G 5G Plus. Four clustered inside a square housing on the back and two on the front.
The two front cameras are really nice as the secondary 8-megapixel is ultra wide lets you cram more faces into selfies without holding your phone further out.
On the back, the four cameras consist of a 48-megapixel main sensor capable of 4K video, an 8MP ultra wide, 5MP macro and 2MP depth. The three ‘secondary’ cameras are all average, but that’s pretty standard on a phone this price.
Snaps the main 48MP sensor are detailed
The macro camera lets you get up close, but it lacks punch
The HDR effect can lead to overexposed shots
Related: Best mid-range phones
Images are soft in various lighting and the macro is nothing more than a gimmick addition you’ll forget is there. 
I guess you’re not really losing anything by having them around and the ultra wide does do its job by giving you a wider view. Even if the results are just never great.
Pictures from the ultra wide aren’t the best
The main 48MP sensor with its f/1.7 lens, on the other hand, is pretty good. It shoots by default at 12-megapixels, combining four pixels into one to give the impression they’re larger, and it produces sharp snaps with pleasing colours. There’s a passable low-light shooting mode that extracts an extra hit of brightness and some AI tricks to boost colours. Pictures aren’t going to compete with those taken on the iPhone SE 2 or Google Pixel 3a, yet they’re colourful enough and the focus is very quick – much more so than with previous Moto Gs.

Moto G 5G Plus Battery life – Excellent all-round
The Moto G 5G Plus continues its impressive run with the battery life. Even with the 90Hz display enabled all the time and brightness pushed up to combat harsh reflectivity, I have easily been getting through the day with around 20% left when I go to plug in at bedtime. Use it a bit less and you’ll likely be able to push it through most of a second day too.
It’s a star when streaming video (an hour of Netflix ate through just 6%) and the 5000mAh battery can be charged fully in about 90 minutes thanks to 20w Turbo Power. There’s no wireless charging though, hardly a surprise.
Should you buy the Moto G 5G Plus?
There’s very little to criticise with the Moto G 5G Plus. Yes, I could say it’s a bit cheap feeling and speaker is a bit naff – but that seems very nitpicking considering what’s on offer.
Related: Moto G Pro review
For £299 (or £349 for the 6GB RAM version) you’re a getting an Android phone that easily matches those costing twice the price. Performance is great, the software clean and the screen bright and fast. It charges up quickly and lasts for ages and it even takes pretty good photos all things considered. The icing on the cake is 5G.

Verdict





























 



I'm still shocked that you can pick up a £245 smartphone with a vibrant AMOLED screen and two-day battery life. For anyone who binges content on their phone, the Samsung Galaxy M31 is an absolute bargain, just don't expect it to wow you in other areas.



Pros

Includes AMOLED screen despite the price
Fantastic battery life
Solid main camera
Great value for money



Cons

Lacklustre wide-angle camera
Bland, slippery design
Slow charging

Samsung’s A-series of smartphones is a staple sight in most UK stores, and for good reason. It’s aimed at attracting the same sizable mid-range crowd that’s currently being eyed up by Xiaomi and OnePlus. And yet, the Galaxy M series is far less recognisable set, despite being a key part of Samsung’s global output.
Hugely popular in India, Galaxy M smartphones try to pack premium specs into an affordable format – at least, that’s what it is on paper. The series recently got a major revision for 2020, and one of those phones – the Samsung Galaxy M31 – has made the journey to the UK market.
The Galaxy A series has done a pretty decent job with the mid-range space, but can Samsung pull the same trick again just further down the price scale? It’s time to find out.
Design – party up front, bland in the back
At 159.2 x 75.1 x 8.9mm and 191g, the Galaxy M31 is a hefty phone by modern standards. Having been recently accustomed to the lightweight nature of the Pixel 3a XL, the M31 felt like a mammoth by comparison. But with that extra weight comes a feeling of heft, letting you know that this is still a solid product, even if it is at the affordable end of the spectrum.
Within that space, the phone packs a 6.4-inch screen, topped by a tear-drop notch and a minimal chin bezel at the bottom. At just £245, I’m amazed at just how uncompromising the front-facing elements of the phone are. There’s even a 3.5mm headphone jack (albeit at the bottom).
As soon as you flip the phone over however, things begin to feel a little different. For starters, the M31’s plastic backing is an absolute fingerprint magnet, and the smooth casing itself doesn’t grip with your hands all too well. Unless you’re absolutely sure in your infallible ability to never drop the phone, we’d recommend picking up a case to be on the safe side.
While there’s a slight camera bump here, the camera’s four-sensor array is barely noticeable, regardless of whether or not the phone’s in your pocket or lying down, with the screen facing upwards on a desk.

Screen – unbelievable quality for the price
Much like the A series, Samsung’s marketing for the M range has focussed on three core features: the screen, the camera and the battery life. While we’ll get to the latter two in just a moment, I’m happy to report that Samsung’s nailed it with the screen on the M31, arguably being the phone’s best feature (aside from the price).
That aforementioned 6.4-inch screen utilises a juicy AMOLED panel with a 2340 x 1080 resolution, ensuring that whatever’s on the screen, be it the homepage background or your second run-through of The Last Dance on Netflix (respect), it always pops.
Of course, even with that high-end FHD+ resolution, there’s no getting around the fact that if you want to dive into the full-screen experience, you’re going to have to deal with the notch cutting into the action. Granted, it’s minuscule compared to the likes of Apple’s now seriously outdated shelf, but it’s still there.
The only other minor issue is that, unlike the new Moto G 5G Plus, it has a basic 60Hz screen. But given how few phones this price have made the jump to 90Hz at the moment, it’s a forgivable omission.
Performance and software – solid for the price, with a few niggling quirks
Having gotten accustomed to using the Pixel 3a XL’s streamlined and near flawless version of Android 10. Samsung’s custom skin feels very clunky, even if it’s not the worst out there.
For instance, there’s very little bloatware with the exception of Samsung’s own variety of apps which tend to have their uses, although why I’d ever need to use the Galaxy Store when Google’s App Store is right there, is beyond me.

Luckily for the M31 however, everything runs fairly well despite its affordable price. This is down to the Samsung Exynos 9611 SoC processor and a solid 6GB RAM under the hood. Don’t expect mind-blowing speed with the M31, but this set-up leads to a fairly decent performance where it counts.
For instance, the dedicated fingerprint sensor is speedy and reliable (arguably moreso than some of the in-screen fingerprint sensors I’ve come across on more expensive handsets). The same goes for face unlock, with a great little animation occurring just below the front-facing camera to let you know it’s doing its thing.
A consistently irritating issue that kept popping up however was an unexplainable incompatibility with certain wearables devices. While this seems to have levelled out after a few software updates, the phone would initially drop its connection with my Whoop 3.0 Band and TicWatch C2 Plus smartwatch on a regular basis. If you’re not a smartwatch fan then you’ll probably never come across this issue, but for a fitness fanatic like myself who loves to track health stats, it became a royal pain.
If you enjoy a spot of mobile gaming on your lunch break, then the M31 should have you covered with most titles – just don’t expect to run Fortnite on it anytime soon. As the launcher incessantly pointed out, the Galaxy M31 is not one of the phones currently optimised to play Fornite, and diving into the game revealed a choppy, barely playable mess. Surprisingly however, the M31 had no trouble running online matches in Call of Duty: Mobile, and smaller titles like Alto’s Odyssey performed well.
Battery life – an absolute beast
Blame it on the fact that my ageing laptop has a bit of a dodgy Wi-Fi connection, but under these new working from home circumstances, I’ve settled on using my phone as the main device of choice for conducting zoom calls, listening to music, tracking my indoor workout and enjoying some YouTube fluff at lunch time. Sufficed to say, I’ve been putting the battery on the Galaxy M31 through its paces, but it’s been fighting back in an impressive way.
Packing a whopping 6000mAh battery, the Galaxy M31 has managed to reach roughly the end of two days on a single charge, despite being connected to Wi-Fi for the majority of that time, with Bluetooth on and multiple wearables and a pair of wireless earbuds connected for good measure. That’s on top of the heavy use activities I mentioned previously. Simply put, you’d have to be a serious procrastinator to even think about draining the battery completely in a single day.

The Galaxy M31 proves that having a multi-day battery life doesn’t cost the Earth, and if you were planning on using the M31 as your main media device of choice, this unbelievable battery life paired with the phone’s AMOLED screen makes for a match-made in heaven. You could binge content for hours on this thing.
The only letdown is the supposed inclusion of 15w fast charging, which I beg to differ. When hooked up to a power outlet, it took just over two hours to reach full charge from 8%. If charging your phone overnight is part of your routine then you’ll never have an issue here, but needing a quick top up before you leave your home is just out of the question.
Camera – aims too high and loses focus along the way
On paper, the promise of a Samsung smartphone with four rear-end cameras for under £250 sounds too good to be true, and sadly, it is. On the back you’ve got a 64-megapixel f/1.8 main sensor, an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide sensor, a 5-megapixel f/2.2 depth sensor and everyone’s favourite, 5-megapixel f/2.4 macro camera.
I kid of course, I don’t happen to share the same disdain for the inclusion of macro cameras on smartphones that other critics do, and it’s fun to snap an artsy shot of a bug or a flower every now and then, but let’s face it, the real meat and potatoes are the ultra-wide and main cameras.
Starting with the latter, I was genuinely surprised to see just how vibrant shots could be with the M31’s main sensor. For example, the portrait shot below of my wonderfully obliging fiancée below has a natural-looking bokeh effect, and colours appear bright without looking saturated.



Selfie with Live Focus off/on
It’s only when you start to zoom in on the portrait that you notice the camera’s inability to pick up finer details, an issue that becomes far more apparent when you swap over to the M31’s ultra-wide angle lens.
Zooming into the corners of any wide-angle shots taken with the M31 reveals a distinct lack of detail. I can understand the appeal of wanting a wide-angle sensor, but if it’s only going to do a sub-par job, then I would much rather see those resources invested into bumping up the main sensor. By comparison, the Pixel 3a only has one rear-facing sensor, but benefits from being one of the best smartphones for photography.
The wide-angle lens fails to retain detail, specifically around the edges.
Video is also a bit of a mixed bag. Amazingly, the Galaxy M31 can shoot in 4K, but the 4K mode is incompatible with the camera’s in-built stabilisation, so you really need a gimbal to get the most out of it. While video stabilisation is available when shooting in HD, the process seemed to bring the fps rate down to a screeching halt, so it’s best avoided here.
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy M31?
If you’re looking for an affordable smartphone, chances are you’ve been eyeing up the likes of the Moto G8 or the Moto G8 Pro, but the Samsung Galaxy has them both beat on two crucial factors: battery life and the display.
With up to two days worth of battery and a gorgeous AMOLED screen to boot, the Galaxy M31 is arguably the perfect phone for content junkies on a budget. Throw in the 3.5mm headphone jack and a MicroSD slot for expandable memory and you’re on to a winner.
Just don’t expect to be impressed by the camera offering across the board. For a consistently excellent experience in this regard, the Pixel 3a is still the camera phone to beat within the affordable price bracket.

Verdict





























 



The Oppo Find X2 Neo is a well balanced phone with a pleasingly skinny form factor and an excellent 90Hz display. It’s a thoroughly decent and dependable mid-range effort, though you can get better performance and software for a similar price from the OnePlus 8.



Pros

Super svelte form factor
Lovely 90Hz AMOLED display
Strong battery life
Stacks of memory



Cons

ColorOS isn’t the best take on Android
The OnePlus 8 ticks most of the same boxes plus more






Key Specifications

Review Price: £549
6.5-inch OLED 90Hz display
Snapdragon 765G
12GB RAM
48MP main camera, 8MP ultrawide, 13MP telephoto, 2MP B/W
32MP selfie camera
4025mAh battery
256GB storage



Oppo’s Find X2 range is just about as comprehensive a smartphone offering as you’ll find in 2020. Of the four 5G-ready devices in the family, the Oppo Find X2 Neo is by the best phone with a super-slim chassis and upper-mid-range specifications for £549.
While it lacks the Oppo Find X2 Pro’s eye-catching periscope camera, the Oppo Find X2’s top end performance, and the Oppo Find X2 Lite’s appealingly low price tag, the Oppo Find X2 Neo might just be the most pleasant to hold and use.
But smack bang in the middle of the smartphone market is a dangerous place to be right now, with threats coming from directly above and below. Does the Oppo Find X2 Neo do enough to stake a claim to your money?
Design and screen – Skinny body housing a dazzling 90Hz screen
The Oppo Find X2 Neo is quite possibly the nicest phone to hold in the entire range, which is impressive given that it’s also the second-cheapest of the four.
It comes in Starry Blue of you buy it from O2 or Carphone Warehouse and Moonlight Black (like our model) from EE, Carphone Warehouse, O2, Virgin Media and Amazon. Whatever the colour, the Neo lacks the vegan leather pizazz of the Pro, and its shiny glass and metal sandwich looks could be considered fairly generic these days. But what makes it special is its skinny profile.
At just 7.7mm thick, this is the slimmest phone in the range. Combined with subtle curves to the glass edges on both the front and back, which sandwich a thin metal frame, the Neo feels sharp and purposeful.

It’s the lightest phone in the family, too, at just 171g. And the Neo spreads that meagre weight well over a fairly large 6.5-inch canvass.
What a lovely screen it is, too. Besides being big, the Oppo Find X2 Neo display is bright and vibrant thanks to the use of a decent quality AMOLED panel. Along with those slightly curved edges and hole punch selfie cam, you might be reminded of the OnePlus 8 screen, but the Oppo actually seems cooler and brighter when the two phones are held side by side.
The Find X2 Neo’s screen shares another feature with its cousin the OnePlus 8 (and the cheaper OnePlus Nord) – a 90Hz refresh rate, which makes scrolling through web pages and home screens feel super smooth. It’s a distinctly premium-feeling inclusion. Add an in-display fingerprint sensor that, while not the fastest, is relatively reliable, and you have a mid-range handset that looks and feels rather premium.

Performance – The Oppo Find X2 Neo is another Snapdragon 765G device
The Oppo Find X2 Neo comes packing a Snapdragon 765G CPU (the same chip you’ll find in many of the best mid-range phones), which is a bit of a negative. Not in terms of day to day performance, which is generally smooth and fluid, but rather in terms of the phone’s relative market position.
Qualcomm’s current second-tier chip is a very capable runner, and one that here feels almost indistinguishable from phones running the flagship Snapdragon 865 in everything but games. Discerning eyes accustomed to 2020 flagship performance might pick up on the odd extra beat it takes to load an app or fire off a quick picture, but most people won’t even notice.
If you believe OnePlus, you can thank the Snapdragon 765G for its return to the affordable phone market with the OnePlus Nord. But that’s just it – the Nord is a £379 phone. Even within the Neo’s own family, the Snapdragon 765G also powers the £400 Oppo Find X2 Lite.
There is a precedent for phones of this price running on this hardware in the shape of the Motorola Edge. But For just £50 more you’ll find the OnePlus 8 with its Snapdragon 865. And the Neo just can’t compete in terms of raw performance, even with an ample 12GB of RAM to back its processor up.
Also generous is the provided 256GB of (non-expandable) storage, while network performance is also top notch thanks to 5G support and Oppo’s comprehensive 360-degree antenna array. The concept feels faintly dated now, but there’ll be no ‘death grip’ scenario putting paid to your calls and web searches here.
All in all, the Oppo Find X2 Neo is an exemplary performer. Just know that for similar money you can step things up to true flagship level.

Camera – Solid but unspectacular mid-range camera
Oppo knows what it’s doing with smartphone camera tech, having made the hugely impressive Oppo Reno 10x Zoom and Oppo Find X2 Pro with their mind-boggling periscope lenses. But the Oppo Find X2 Neo is a mid-range phone with a solid but unspectacular mid-range camera.
You’re effectively getting a triple camera set-up here, with a 48-megapixel f/1.7 Sony IMX586 main sensor, a 13-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto, and an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide. Only the primary sensor has optical image stabilisation. There’s also a 2-megapixel mono camera, which is largely superfluous, and a 32-megapixel front-facing camera.
You can always opt to punch the colours up a little by activating the Dazzle Color AI mode. We tended to leave it off for more natural results.
The rear camera is a nicely balanced shooter, with a telephoto lens that doesn’t stray too far from the main sensor in terms of tone. The ultrawide tends to get a little too noisy for our liking, however, but that’s not unusual when straying south of flagship territory.
Comparing shots like for like with the similarly priced Motorola Edge and OnePlus 8, there wasn’t a clear winner. The OnePlus 8 (which uses the same main sensor as the Oppo) seems to have a bit of an edge when it comes to general colour balance and detail. On an overcast day, the Find X2 Neo would tend to introduce a smidgen more noise to the grey-white skies.
The Oppo’s shots were often brighter but noisier than the OnePlus, and it seemed to struggle more with overexposure. Its night time performance was a little patchier and less easy on the eye, too – particularly in extremely low light scenarios. Conversely, the Oppo Find X2 Neo benefits from a dedicated telephoto lens, which the OnePlus 8 lacks, resulting in superior 2x zoom shots.
On the video front you get Oppo’s Ultra Steady Video 2.0 for super-smooth footage, though this is also present in the cheaper Oppo Find X2 Lite.
All in all, it’s a very competent camera, though it doesn’t really threaten to punch above its weight like the Pixel 3a or the iPhone SE 2.
        
Software – ColorOS 7 needs an overhaul
The Oppo Find X2 Neo is the third consecutive Oppo phone running ColorOS 7 that we’ve used now, which means we’ve grown rather accustomed to this strain of custom Android 10 UI.
Its faintly nannying pop-up prompts don’t grate quite as much as they did at the beginning of our time with the Oppo Find X2, while we no longer emit a quiet groan when we scroll left to check the latest Google Feed news only to find Oppo’s Smart Assistant tool.
Oppo has stripped ColorOS back a little since the early days too. You no longer get a pointless secondary App Store, for example, while the list of preinstalled apps is relatively short.
There are still irritating choices on display, however, like the inexplicable inclusion of both Opera and Chrome web browsers. We’re not sure which would-be video editor would want to use Oppo’s own Soloop app in place of the many third party alternatives on the Google Play Store, while there are much better mindfulness services out there thanks Oppo Relax.
While you’d think we’d be well versed in ColorOS by now, it’s still easy to get lost in the Settings menu from time to time. It’s an awful mess.

But everything moves along fluidly, and ColorOS also retains the quality of being quite customisable. Granted, it’s far from unique in that regard, but this means you can mitigate those irritations and make it quite pleasant to live with.
Battery Life – Oppo impresses with fast charging again
The Oppo Find X2 Neo runs off a 4025mAh battery, which is exactly the same capacity as the Oppo Find X2 Lite. With the same processor and a brighter, faster display, you might expect a slight drop off in battery life, but it’s still good for well past a solid day of usage.
In our testing, 4 hours 30 minutes of screen on time brought the battery down to 30 percent. That means it’s good for five to six hours of screen on time, which represents a seriously heavy day of usage.
When it came to testing media consumption, an hour of Netflix streaming with the screen set to half brightness sapped 7% of the Neo’s battery. That’s exactly the same result as we got with the Find X2 Lite and the Find X2. Not bad at all, in other words.
One area in which Oppo tends to excel is in its own proprietary recharging technology. The Oppo Find X2 Neo comes with a 30W VOOC 4.0 charger, which is a notch below the brand’s very best effort.
Even so, we noted that the Neo charged from 29% to 93% in just half an hour. When we checked back again after another 15 minutes (so 45 minutes overall), it had hit 100%. That’s excellent going.
You won’t find any wireless charging here, which is unsurprising given that the Oppo Find X2 Pro and the Oppo Find X2 lack it too. It’s way more forgivable at this price, where such a feature is rarely found.
Should you buy the Oppo Find X2 Neo?
The Oppo Find X2 Neo is a very good phone with a remarkably skinny design and a fluid 90Hz AMOLED display. If you wish that modern flagships were skinnier and lighter as well as cheaper, it’s well worth a look.
Taken in isolation, the Neo is tough to pick too many faults with. Of course, £600 smartphones don’t exist in isolation, and just as the Oppo Find X2 took a hit from its close proximity to the imperious OnePlus 8 Pro, so too does the Oppo Find X2 Neo bear an unflattering resemblance to the OnePlus 8.
While this is a very accomplished and usable phone, for a little more money you can get a handset with superior performance and software. With all of its efforts going into a more desirable chassis, meanwhile, Oppo hasn’t been able to flex its impressive camera muscles this time around, although the results are perfectly decent.

Verdict




























 



The Galaxy Z Flip is the best folding phone so far, but it still isn’t for everyone. It’s a regular phone size when unfolded and a little coaster of a thing when closed. The specs are high-end but not the best available, and it’s undoubtedly fragile. But if it appeals and you can afford it, there’s a lot of fun to be had with its completely new form factor, top performance and solid battery life.



Pros

Undeniable wow factor
Excellent battery life
Great performance



Cons

Very expensive
Fragile display
  Can’t use it closed






Key Specifications

Review Price: £1300
Folding glass display
6.7-inch screen
3200mAh battery
8GB RAM



If you are bored with the fact the last few phones you bought all look the same, then the Galaxy Z Flip might well be the new phone for you. It’s a purple folding flip phone that looks like a coaster or a compact mirror when closed but acts pretty much like a regular smartphone when opened.
Everyone I showed it to while reviewing it was bowled over by the fact it folds, but they were just as shocked by the price. If folding phones are to become the norm, the Z Flip will be remembered for forging a bold but pricy path at the infancy of the form factor.
Yet it’s cheaper and more usable than the Galaxy Fold that went before it, and it represents Samsung maturing its foldable line up rather quickly. But should you go for this over a more typical best Android phone?
Price and release date
The Z Flip is available in purple or black for the princely sum of £1300/$1380. 
That is indeed a lot, but it’s only £100 more than Samsung’s own £1199 Galaxy S20 Ultra, a ginormous, bulky slab of a best phone. 
If you can stretch to £1300, you’ll get a phone with a tiny footprint that, let’s not forget, folds in half. I’d pick the Z Flip, even if that is much more than anyone actually needs to spend on a smartphone in 2020. 
Design

The Z Flip rewrites the rules

Samsung got a fair amount of flack for the Galaxy Fold, its first folding phone that was delayed because of build quality issues. That device is a tablet that folds down to something approaching phone-sized, whereas the Z Flip unfolds to phone size for use but folds away to something far more compact.
This means the Z Flip can and should be your next main phone if you want it to be, whereas the Fold’s bulky design and sky-high price made me feel it was best suited to being a second device. 
Samsung stepped up the manufacturing quality for the Z Flip, adding a very thin layer of glass into the construction of the folding screen. It’s still a glossy plastic layer on the surface that you interact with, but the glass layer underneath means it’s harder to permanently mark the display with a fingernail (though not impossible). But make no mistake – this is still a supremely fragile phone, and it’s not a full glass display.
The internal screen looks great, particularly at full brightness where Samsung’s displays always excel. The outside of my review sample was the brilliant Mirror Purple finish, which you really can use as a mirror thanks to the reflective finish, but the glass picks up fingerprints in nanoseconds. It’s also available in Mirror Black.

I was worried that the actual folding mechanism would feel shaky, but it is very well done. There is more resistance than you’d find on a flip phone from the mid-2000s, and it’s quite fiddly to open it one-handed. This design necessarily opens a full 180 degrees to transform into a flat screen, and it’s hard to snap it shut with the same satisfactory clunk as your old flip phone from years ago. 

There’s a plastic rim around the display with rubber contacts on the bottom corners where both ends meet when you close the phone. It doesn’t quite close flat, but it’s barely noticeable. It does mean that dust and lint collect in the small gap nearest the hinge in between the two halves of the display, though.
It’s a package that screams premium, and well it should, considering the price. It’s also really fun to snap the phone shut to end a call. 
Screen

The Z Flips’s main event

The Z Flip opens like an old clamshell flip phone, and it’s that inside screen where you have to do everything. The Galaxy Fold has full an external display that means you don’t have to always open the phone, but here there’s only a 1.1in cover display that shows the time and tiny icons and previews of notifications. It’s pretty useless for anything else, so you’ll be doing a lot of flipping.
The cutest thing you can use it for is a selfie viewfinder. Double-tap the power button when closed, and it becomes one, though its shape means it’s still a bit of a guess as to what you’ll fit in. It also works to show people you’re taking a photo of with the rear cameras what they look like (if they squint). 
Inside is a 6.7in 21.9:9 AMOLED display that in the right light looks sharp, crisp, and as well-lit as any full glass Samsung panel. It’s very impressive. Colour reproduction is great with Samsung’s usual over-saturation of colours to make things pop. 

Given that most of the phone’s construction has to be plastic – including the part you actually touch – the screen picks up oil and fingerprints insanely fast, and, in bright light, it’s hard to read. If you’re constantly wiping your phone screen down, this one will be a nightmare for you.
There’s also the obvious crease bang in the middle of the screen. If you’re watching a video at full brightness or looking at something head-on, it sort of disappears. But in most lights and at most angles, it’s there, and you can see it. This is the compromise of folding phones currently – yes, it folds, but that crease is not ironed out when it’s open.
You can feel it under your thumb when scrolling, but it feels like a better built mechanism than the Galaxy Fold’s, and I was able to be fairly rough with the thing without fear of breaking it. 
Performance

Last year’s specs still hold up

The Z Flip uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 885 Plus chipset rather than the latest high-end 865 you’ll find in the OnePlus 8 series or some models of the Galaxy S20. This really doesn’t matter for the Z Flip. Performance is whip-fast paired with 8GB RAM, and the phone never stuttered on any task during my time with it. 
There’s 256GB of non-expandable storage, odd for a Samsung phone but likely a constraint of the smaller, new form factor.

Phones like the OnePlus 8 Pro with 12GB RAM are technically faster and may well feel faster thanks to the animations used in the software. It is true that the Z Flip does not have the most premium specs in 2020, but it’s still a premium performer. 
Camera

The Z Flip camera is good enough for most people

Samsung may have skimped ever so slightly on the specs to keep the price down, and that corner-cutting continues with the cameras. They are pretty good but not great for a phone of this price, with dual 12Mp sensors. The main lens is f/1.8 with OIS, and it’s paired with a f/2.2 ultrawide, leaving the Z Flip without a telephoto lens – so all zoom shots are done digitally, not optically.

I did miss the optical zoom as the up to 8x digital zoom here does not give great results, but the ultrawide allowed me to get some impressive shots. The f/2.4 10Mp front-facing camera is not much to write home about, but it did fine for video calls and selfies. The latter appear a little washed out and lacked the detail you’ll get from the iPhone 11 series or the Pixel 4. 
There’s nothing like a macro mode either, but the cameras cope fine with close-ups. I found I had to tap to focus more than with other phones, but I was pleased with the photos overall. I still prefer the iPhone 11’s processing. 
Video recording is solid, with support for 4K@60fps on the rear cameras and 4K@30fps on the front. The rear cameras have software video stabilisation built-in, and it helps massively. You can also toggle on HEVC and HDR10+ modes if you’re more technically minded or want to use the Z Flip for content creation. 
A few camera features are carried over from the S20 phones like Single Take that takes photos and video clips in a few seconds with one shutter press and lets you pick the most interesting results. I’m sure it would have come in very handy were it not for lockdown and my inability to do anything fun or with people.
Samsung also built in Flex Mode for some apps where you can half fold the phone, and the top half of the display becomes the viewfinder. This works excellently with the camera app if you want to take a group selfie as you can place the phone down and set a timer. It also works in Google Duo, meaning hands-free video calls are much easier than if I were trying to prop up a regular shaped phone.
But apart from YouTube, there are hardly any other apps that are compatible, and it is unlikely developers will prioritise building it in given the Z Flip is such a niche device. Flex Mode one of the few software quirks in a phone with such unique hardware, proving that this really is a regular phone that folds away small rather than a device that fully embraces its form factor to do new things.
See below for some sample shots:




Battery life

Surprisingly strong

With no Samsung Exynos chip version of the Z Flip, all models are equipped with the Snapdragon 855 Plus, which is a good thing for the battery life. The Z Flip only has a 3,300mAh cell, so it needs all the help it can get.
Samsung’s Qualcomm-powered phones always outperform their counterparts on the battery life front, and the Z Flip is no different. I easily got through every day without even thinking about plugging the phone in. When I wanted to, the bundled 15W charger had me covered, alongside built-in wireless charging. 
15W wired charging is not the fastest available in 2020 with 25W on the S20 and 45W on the S20 Ultra. It’s another area where Samsung has cut corners to keep the price down. 
Lockdown restrictions were eased in New Zealand where I live while I was reviewing the phone, meaning I put it through a few freer days of photo taking, Google Maps navigation in the car, social media scrolling and food ordering. 
Remember normal times? Well, when they return, the Z Flip will be able to keep up no problem. It can get four hours of screen on time and still have about 30% power left. This is by no means the best on the market for battery life, but it suited my usage habits fine.
The phone also packs in Wireless Power Share, which I used to charge my AirPods. It’s a nice feature to have, but it’s not powerful enough to fully recharge another phone, and of course, it depletes the Z Flip’s battery when not plugged into the mains. 

Software

Samsung’s One UI is the best it’s ever been

I tested the phone on Android 10 with Samsung’s One UI 2.1, and it is a very well-polished software skin. It feels as premium as the device, and Samsung has made sure that its app formatting is perfect – I didn’t experience any incompatibility or formatting issues with any apps in portrait orientation. 
It’s a different story when you watch video in landscape, something that isn’t very enjoyable on the Z Flip thanks to black bars either side of the action and a big visible crease down the centre of the picture. There are phones that it’s OK to watch video on, in my opinion, this is not one of them.
Samsung’s split view software works well, but it’s not as useful on a tall folding screen here as it is on the tablet-sized Galaxy Fold. As with most phones, I didn’t find it that useful. 
There are a few duplicate apps pre-loaded, but you can easily disable or uninstall them, much like the Microsoft apps Samsung also bundles on its new phones these days. Compared to Pixel and OnePlus phones, the Z Flip does tend to ping notifications from Samsung services fairly often, so I found there was a two or three-day bedding in period with the phone while I turned off app notifications constantly as they flooded in.
Annoying Samsung has left its DeX desktop support off the Z Flip, something it offers on the Galaxy S and Note lines. Surely this is just a software update away? All it requires is a USB-C cable and monitor. It’s odd to me that Samsung wouldn’t keep the handy tool on a phone this expensive. 
I spent my entire time with the phone ignoring the Bixby personal assistant. There’s no Bixby button (phew), and you can remap the power button to not open it with a long press, allowing you to ignore its existence. You also get the better Google Assistant built-in, and I found using my regular Google and Microsoft services on the phone is a great experience.

Samsung phones also work very well with Microsoft’s Your Phone software for Windows 10. It’s so well integrated that it’s an icon in the quick settings shade and allows you to make and receive calls and messages on your desktop or laptop. 
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip?
The Z Flip is a phone for tech heads and early adopters who must have the latest in cutting edge design. A fair chunk of disposable income will help too.
It’s better built and more durable than the Galaxy Fold, and the form factor makes more sense, but this is still a fragile folding phone. The display is a marvel at times, but at others, it’s a greasy plastic surface with a crease and lots of reflection.
If you’re chasing the best specs possible for the price, then this also isn’t the phone for you. Think of it as a Galaxy S10 in a new outfit. But if you can stomach paying more for the party trick, then you’ll be happy with the Z Flip.

Verdict




























 



The Oppo Find X2 Lite gets all the essentials right, with a balanced OLED display, solid performance, a reliable camera, sterling battery life and 5G connectivity at an affordable price.




Pros

Solid performance
Decent camera
Excellent battery life
5G at a good price



Cons

Slightly uninspiring design
ColorOS still has its foibles
No Full HD video streaming
You can get 90/120Hz displays at this price now






Key Specifications

Review Price: £399
–6.4-inch FHD+ OLED display
Snapdragon 765G
8GB RAM
48MP main camera, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP B/W, 2MP depth
32MP selfie camera
4025mAh battery
128GB storage


Following the premium-priced Oppo Find X2 Pro and the ‘affordable flagship’ Oppo Find X2, attention now turns to the lower-mid-range Oppo Find X2 Lite.
With £399 SIM-free starting price, it costs exactly half as much as the Find X2 and slightly more than the OnePlus Nord. You’d expect a few compromises for such a saving, and sure enough the Find X2 Lite bears little resemblance to its big brothers beyond a familiar ColorOS UI.
You’re still getting a big OLED display, a vibrant 48-megapixel camera and 5G connectivity however, while performance is pretty snappy for phone at this price.
The question is, can Oppo retain its capacity to produce some of the best cheap phones around??
Design and screen – Tight build and decent OLED, but not video-friendly
The Oppo Find X2 Lite doesn’t shoot for a higher level of design like the similarly priced TCL 10 Pro. Aside from the shimmery Pearl White finish of our test model, it’s quite plain-looking.
While its design doesn’t thrill, though, the Oppo Find X2 Lite is built really well. At 180g and with twin glass surfaces and an aluminium frame, it feels far more premium in the hand than the plasticky Sony Xperia 10 II.
The Lite’s plastic screen surround, non-curved display, dewdrop notch and subtle chin don’t speak to a great deal of ambition. But design ambition is rare at this price point anyway – hello iPhone SE 2.

There’s a similar level of understated quality to the Find X2 Lite’s screen. With this 6.4-inch FHD+ OLED display, there’s really nothing that immediately grabs the eye like the TCL 10 Pro’s waterfall edges or the Sony Xperia 10 II’s 21:9 aspect ratio. You won’t get elevated refresh rates either.
What you do get is arguably more valuable than mere wow factor – a large enough, sharp enough, and plenty bright enough OLED that puts out vibrant but not lurid colours. And if you don’t take to its punchy reds, you can scale it back to the more sober ‘Gentle’ mode, or hand-tweak the warmth with a handy slider.
That dewdrop notch does rather interfere with video content, though. By default, Netflix shuffles the picture down to avoid being eaten into, but the opposite corners then get shaved off disconcertingly by the Oppo Find X2 Lite’s exaggerated curves.
The Oppo Find X2 Lite doesn’t come with the necessary DRM to support Full HD resolution video playback on Netflix or Amazon Prime. You’ll need to turn to YouTube, the Google Play Video Store, or some other source if you want to watch Full HD video content.

The Oppo Find X2 Lite has a single bottom-mounted speaker, which gets nice and loud even if the sound signature is a little thin and reedy. It also has a 3.5mm jack, although its placement is just about the worst possible for video watching and gaming, on the same edge but opposite corner to the aforementioned speaker.
This means that the natural landscape holding position, which avoids blocking the speaker with your palm, ends up placing your headphone connector right where you want to rest your hand.
Performance – The Oppo Find X2 Lite has good performance for the price
The Oppo Find X2 Lite runs on Qualcomm’s current mid-range processor of choice, the Snapdragon 765G CPU. Together with a generous 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, it’s a very well specced out phone.
I moved directly to it from using the £1100 Sony Xperia 1 II as my daily driver, and the £800 Oppo Find X2 before that. It’s a tribute to the Find X2 Lite (and Qualcomm) that there’s no the jolt to the senses that’s common with such a step-down. Apps open quickly, UI animations are fluid, and the camera opens reasonably snappily from the lock screen.
Even the in-display fingerprint sensor turned out to be both speedy enough and suitably reliable – at least as far as these things go. This particular writer would still take a high quality separate sensor any day of the week, but that’s probably raging against the tide at this point.
The ‘G’ part of the Snapdragon 765G name signifies that its GPU has received a bit of a boost, and all of the games tried on the phone ran flawlessly. CoD Mobile defaults to High settings for graphic quality and frame rate, which proved very smooth. But it remained playable even when bumped up and anti-aliasing turned on and ragdoll physics. Super-slick 2D shooter Juicy Realm defaulted to high resolution and frame rate, and even adding post-processing effects to the mix failed to make it stutter.
The Find X2 Lite is also a fast mover when it comes to network performance, thanks to 5G connectivity. 5G at lower prices is no longer a novelty, but this remains one of your most affordable options if you want to benefit from next-level network speeds.

Camera – Decent shots in good lighting, super-steady video
Oppo tends to extract a lot of performance from its camera hardware, and you’ll get some impressive results here.
No, it doesn’t even approach the quality of the Find X2 Pro with its huge sensor and its 10x zoom lens, nor does it have the all-round photographic game of the Find X2. But for £400, you wouldn’t expect it to.

For that sort of money, you can expect good quality shots in decent lighting. And that’s precisely what the Oppo Find X2 Lite provides.
This is ostensibly a quad-camera set-up, though there are actually only two out and out camera sensors – a 48-megapixel f/1.7 wide sensor and an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide that doubles as a macro. The other two are a pair of 2-megapixel sensors, one mono and one depth sensing.
In good lighting, standard snaps tended to be detailed and punchy, if a little oversaturated. Colours tended towards the vibrant anyway, and activating the Dazzle Colour AI mode punched things up a little too much for our tastes.
Given the lack of a telephoto lens, the quality of the 2x zoomed shots is impressive. They’re not flawless by any means, but they are eminently usable for social media posts and the like. Clearly Oppo’s pixel-binning and cropping algorithms are on point.
Moving up to 5x pushes well past the system’s limitations, though, with excessive noise prompting us to give up on using the facility pretty quickly. I also gave up on using the ultrawide lens for wide-angle shots. Its shots look very soft and distorted, especially at the edges, with a lot of noise and some oddly artificial colours.
The Night mode does a good job at brightening low light shots, but it doesn’t retain an awful lot of detail, and extremely low light scenarios tend to descend into extremely noisy territory.
Oppo seems especially keen to highlight the Find X2 Lite’s Ultra Steady Video 2.0 video stabilisation system, even going so far as printing ‘Ultra Steady’ under the camera module. 
See below for some samples:




Software – Fast and customisable, but still a little ugly
We’ve encountered Oppo’s ColorOS UI a fair amount over the years, in Realme phones as well as the manufacturer’s own hardware. It’s seldom if ever appeared in the Pros section of those reviews, and has often cropped up in the Cons.
ColorOS has undoubtedly cleaned up its act over the years though, and ColorOS 7 on the Oppo Find X2 Lite is fast and reliable. It’s not a pleasure to use exactly, but it is fairly easy to get used to.
It’s still ugly though, with prosaic icons and menus that tend towards obfuscation. See the bewildering scramble that is the Settings menu for evidence, or the fact that you can’t uninstall apps directly from the home screen. Or even the simple fact that you can’t see precisely how much battery life you have left until you go into the Battery section of the Settings menu.
Oppo’s OS has its quirks
Not by default, at least. One of the main strengths of ColorOS is that it’s very customisable. You can make that battery figure appear if you so wish, flip to a gesture-based control system, and tinker with the home screen layout to make it just so.
If only there was the option to switch off Oppo’s Smart Assistant screen to the left of the home screen in favour of the usual Google Feed. In fairness, Smart Assistant can be quite useful, with the kind of widget assembly that will be familiar to iOS users. But the choice would be nice.
There’s no secondary App Store that no one asked for here, though why anyone would need Opera in addition to Chrome out of the box, I’m not sure. And you still get a bunch of Oppo’s own apps, such as the video editor app Soloop and the Oppo Relax relaxation tool.
Battery Life – Two day potential with fast 30W charging
The Oppo Find X2 Lite has admirable stamina. It starts with a nicely sized 4025mAh battery which, together with Oppo’s power-saving software tweaks, will see you light to moderate users deep into a second day of usage.
After more than 5 hours of screen on time, which featured an hour of Amazon Prime Video streaming, lots of web usage, some messaging, a few calls and some photos, there was 30% left in the tank.
Media consumption didn’t hit the battery too hard either, with an hour of Amazon Prime streaming on 50% screen brightness sapping around 7% of a charge. Although, there is the caveat that it wasn’t streaming at Full HD, as per the aforementioned DRM issue.
Oppo has long been a front runner when it comes to fast charging technology. While the 30W VOOC Flash Charge 4.0 standard that ships with the Lite isn’t its top notch charging platform, it still tops the flagship efforts of more high profile brands such as Apple and Sony.
You can get the Oppo Find X2 Lite from 30% to 92% in just 30 minutes using the bundled charger.
Should you buy the Oppo Find X2 Lite?
The Oppo Find X2 is a solid option in a £400 smartphone class that suddenly became a whole lot tougher with the arrival of the iPhone SE, OnePlus Nord and Moto G 5G Plus along with a number of other best mid-range phones. While the Lite can’t beat Apple’s affordable hotshot in terms of performance or software experience (ColorOS isn’t the optimal take on Android 10), it does pack a larger, sharper OLED display and 5G connectivity. It’s just those cheaper Android alternatives that make this a harder sell.
Meanwhile, its battery life and speedy charging inspire a great deal of confidence when heading out and about. In short, as a £400 pick, the Oppo Find X2 Lite is as steady as one of its video captures

Verdict





























 



The Oppo Find X2 offers largely the same experience as the illustrious Oppo Find X2 Pro for £300 less, with one of the best screens on the market, faultless performance, and an appealing design. The existence of the OnePlus 8 Pro – a very similar package with several notable advantages – tempers our enthusiasm somewhat, but the Oppo Find X2 remains an easy phone to like.



Pros

Fast 65W charging
Brilliant 120Hz OLED screen
Much cheaper than the Pro



Cons

Camera decent but doesn’t compete with best
OnePlus 8 Pro offers similar but slightly better package
No wireless charging

The Oppo Find X2 is the reasonably priced flagship phone we craved after the brilliant but expensive Oppo Find X2 Pro. It’s arguably the better pick for most people, but its standing is somewhat weakened by the existence of another close relative.
With a listed SIM-free price of £799 (though it’s an O2 contract exclusive at UK launch), the Oppo Find X2 undercuts the Oppo Find X2 Pro by a not inconsiderable £300. You’d expect some serious compromises as a result, but all you’re really getting is a downgraded camera and half the amount of internal storage.
Given that the Find X2’s triple camera still passes muster, and that its 256GB of memory remains ample, it represents much better value than its Pro brother.
If it weren’t for the OnePlus 8 Pro, the Oppo Find X2 would be an unqualified recommendation. Even as things stand, though, it’s a very good phone indeed.
Design and screen – The Oppo Find X2 is one sharp looker
While it doesn’t have the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom’s eye-catching notchless display and pop-up selfie-cam, or the Oppo Find X2 Pro’s striking vegan leather option, the Oppo Find X2 is a handsome phone to look at.
There’s a sense of understated class to its dark metallic rim and black ceramic back. The latter boasts a subtle wavy visual effect across the right three quarters of the phone, with the remaining strip of purely reflective material playing host to the Oppo logo and legal blurb.

It’s distinctive without being ostentatious, and it’s arguably prettier than the blank canvass OnePlus 8 Pro. That said, the latter can boast an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, while the Find X2 can only stretch to IP54.
You do pay a weight penalty for that choice of ceramic material, too. At 209g, the Find X2 is 17g heavier than the plain glass model available elsewhere, and 10g heavier than the OnePlus 8 Pro.
A pronounced dimple on the bottom edge makes for a comfortable pinkie-propping point, though your holding thumb won’t get anywhere near the top third of the phone. This is a large phone, and Oppo’s software tricks – swipe up on the right edge for the app tray and down for universal search – aren’t quite reliable enough to make for a viable one-handed experience. But show us the Android flagship that is.
Talking of edges, Oppo has gone with the same kind of pronounced dual-curved approach as the OnePlus 8 Pro and the Huawei P40 Pro. Like those phones it looks great, but has limited practical value, and it actually makes the phone a little trickier to wield. Video content also tends to experience awkward distortion effects where the screen bends.
That can pretty much be forgiven, though, when you turn your attention to the screen itself. It’s an absolute stunner – 6.7-inches of prime OLED, with a QHD+ resolution, vibrant yet accurate colours, HDR10+, and a peak brightness of 1,200 nits.

Oppo’s 01 Ultra Vision Engine will do its best to upscale lower frame rate and non-HDR content to be worthy of this wonderful screen. It works with the likes of Netflix and YouTube.
The screen’s headline feature, though, is a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate. You’ll have to force it to that in the Settings menu if you want the full 2X experience all the time, as it’s set to automatically scale by default. But it won’t prove an unreasonable strain on battery life if you do.
If this screen seems familiar to you, that’s because it’s more than likely the exact same unit as the OnePlus 8 Pro’s. The two phones share an awful lot of DNA, as Oppo and OnePlus are owned by the same company. In this respect at least, we’re very glad of the duplication.
Performance – The Oppo Find X2 is fast and responsive as they come
Another way in which the Oppo Find X2 shadows its cousin the OnePlus 8 Pro is when it comes to performance. With the exact same Snapdragon 865 CPU (a feature it shares with most other current flagships) and 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM, it’s just about as fast as a baseline as any Android phone gets in early 2020.
Coupled with that 120Hz display (and zippy 240Hz touch refresh rate), the Oppo Find X2 feels fast. While ColorOS isn’t our favourite UI, it doesn’t hinder that sensation of speed and fluidity at all.
That feeling is carried through to intensive games such as Juicy Realm and CoD Mobile. You can go all in on maximum settings, and the Find X2 will take it all in its stride. Oppo has included a Game Assistant too, which can overlay or block messaging apps, block calls, show you your frame rate and more.
You’ll have plenty of room for storing such apps and games too. While only it’s only got half the allotment of the Pro, 256GB is still nothing to be sniffed at, even without expansion potential.
An average Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 3227 and single-core score of 906 places it on a par with the Oppo Find X2 Pro and OnePlus 8 Pro, as you’d expect.

It’s also worth mentioning that there’s an in-display fingerprint sensor here, and while the technology still feels like a work in progress, this is one of the quicker and more reliable examples we’ve tried.
Camera – Fine, but doesn’t keep pace with its contemporaries
Oppo has made some incredible camera phones in recent years, including 2019’s Oppo Reno 10x Zoom and this year’s Oppo Find X2 Pro. The Oppo Find X2 doesn’t match either for pure wow factor, but it’s perfectly decent. Whether ‘perfectly decent’ is enough at the £800 price category is up for debate, but we’ll get into that.
This is a triple camera offering with a 48-megapixel f/1.7 main sensor, a 13-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto, and a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide. The first two sport optical image stabilisation.

The results of this set-up were generally positive. The Find X2 takes good, detailed, well-balanced shots in good lighting. It also employs auto-HDR well when there’s excessive shade, though it can struggle with overexposure on particularly bright days.
The telephoto camera does well to give you reasonably crisp 2X shots, but there is no periscope lens like the Find X2 Pro and the Reno 10x Zoom. As a result, the 5X shots involve a lot of cropping and some noticeable noise.
Portrait shots are crisp, with the subject really standing out from the blurred background, though it’s not immune from blurring out stray hair clumps and other edge elements. The 32-megapixel selfie camera is a strong performer, too.
In all this, though, we have to come back to those like-for-like comparisons. The Oppo Find X2 uses the same Sony IMX586 main sensor as the OnePlus 8, the Xiaomi Mi 9 and the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom. This sensor is older and markedly smaller than the Sony IMX689 used by both the Oppo Find X2 Pro and – crucially – the OnePlus 8 Pro.
This makes it good but not cutting-edge tech. Of course, we praised the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom for getting more out of this sensor than its immediate rivals. But that was a year ago and £100 cheaper. The competition and expectations faced by the Oppo Find X2 are much steeper, with the OnePlus 8 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S20 offering you more performance for the same money.
In its favour, the Oppo Find X2 seems to experience fewer focusing errors than the OnePlus 8 Pro, which can be a little temperamental. But there’s no denying that the otherwise similarly specced OnePlus 8 Pro takes flat out better photos in most situations. They’re brighter, better-lit, and downright sharper than the Oppo.
Check out some image samples below:
   
Software – Slightly less busy than before
ColorOS 7.1 on the Oppo Find X2 isn’t the total eyesore it used to be. In Oppo and Realme phones past, we often lamented this custom UI’s heavy-handed nature.
It might well be ameliorated by the slick display and speedy performance of the phone, but we enjoyed using ColorOS on the Find X2 way more than before. It’s not as stuffed up with pointless duplicate apps and services, or a secondary App Store that no one asked for.
It’s not entirely likeable, though. There are still a fair few custom preinstalled apps, like a video editor (Soloop) and a chintzy relaxation tool (Oppo Relax). Scroll to the left, meanwhile, and you get a widget-filled Smart Assistant in place of the usual Google Feed. We can actually conceive of this being more useful to some, but having the option would have been welcome.
The menus, too, are a little gauche and nannying, never shy of asking you the same thing repeatedly. Like when adding all your games to the Game Space launcher, and being asked each time to confirm the flicking of a toggle.

But as we’ve already stated, everything moves along at an appreciable lick, making it well worth your time enabling that permanent 120Hz refresh rate. Indeed, you can customise the look and feel of the Find X2 to a considerable degree here.
We’d still take the stock Android experience as offered by the Pixel 4, or the lighter and more tasteful efforts of OnePlus, Motorola, and Sony as a matter of preference. But ColorOS on the Oppo Find X2 is perfectly usable.
Battery Life – Solid stamina and extremely fast charging with one glaring omission
The Oppo Find X2’s battery situation is largely good news, with a small but potentially significant down side.
First, the good stuff. This 4200mAh battery is more than up to the task of powering that large, bright, sharp and responsive display. We were able to get through a day of fairly heavy usage and well beyond with moderate usage. We recorded screen on times of five to six hours in between charges.
Media consumption didn’t overly tax the Oppo Find X2 either. An hour of Netflix, with the screen set to half brightness (which is still pretty bright), sapped just 7% of a charge.
Oppo’s top of the line SuperVOOC 2.0 Flash Charge technology and bundled 65W charger offer some of the fastest charging we’ve seen. We put the Oppo Find X2 on charge with 15% left in the tank, and just 15 minutes later we were up to 73%. After another 15 minutes, it had hit 99%. From red lining to nigh-on full in half an hour is extremely impressive stuff.
Which makes it slightly disappointing to note that the Oppo Find X2 doesn’t have wireless charging. Practically speaking, this won’t be much of an issue for a lot of people, but wireless charging is now virtually universal at this end of the market.
An Oppo representative told us that the omission came down to the fact that no wireless charging standard could stand up to their own rapid VOOC charger in terms of raw speed, and that they wanted to perfect any such wireless standard.
If they can capture even a slice of that VOOC magic in a wireless setting for future phones, we’ll be in for a treat. Watch this space.
Should you buy the Oppo Find X2?
If the Oppo Find X2 comes to you as a contract option, you can feel confident taking it up without hesitation. It’s a really well built phone with largely top of the line components at a competitive price.
Its screen, in particular, is one of the best you can get. You can add speedy performance and super-fast wired charging to the package, and all for a price well south of the Pro.

Want the best phone? There are our picks
You don’t need to spend a fortune – the best mid-range phones offer a lot for less
These best cheap phones will save even more cash

There are a couple of notes of caution, however. The Find X2’s camera, while far from bad, is well shy of the top tier, and the omission of wireless charging is an odd choice. ColorOS isn’t the cleanest take on Android, either, and you don’t get the comfort of IP68 water resistance certification.
If such things are an issue for you, then you’re better off with the OnePlus 8 Pro, which has almost all of the good points of the Find X2 and none of the drawbacks. Otherwise, buy with confidence.

Verdict


































Xiaomi’s going after the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and Oppo’s Find X2 Pro with the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro flagship, which comes with excellent specs and a sky-high price to match. 
How much is Xiaomi charging for the Mi 10 Pro? Around £1,000 – a huge sum of money. Charging big bucks and making a serious flagship was a good move for Oppo, based on Find X2 Pro reviews, and while OnePlus hasn’t climbed to the £1000 mark, the OnePlus 8 Pro was its most expensive flagship to date and it’s a solid smartphone. 
Can Xiaomi match its rival’s success with the Mi 10 Pro, and can a brand famous for affordability steal the show at an overcrowded flagship table?
Design and screen

Great looking phone with a knockout screen
Very minimal bezel surrounding the display
Small notch housing the selfie camera

There’s very little to dislike about the Xiaomi Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro’s design. The Pro, in particular, with its matte finish around the back, is a premium feeling, good looking smartphone with a knockout screen.
There isn’t much that’s truly unique about the Mi 10 Pro design. It doesn’t pack a four-sided curved display like the  Huawei P40 Pro or P40 Pro Plus, nor is it the longest phone on the block like the Sony Xperia 1 II. What the Mi 10 Pro gets right, however, it gets very right.
Taking centre stage on the Mi 10 and Mi 10 Pro is a big, bright AMOLED display that clocks in at 6.67 inches, making it bigger than most phones. With a 90% screen-to-body ratio, it beats out the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max on that front, delivering a notch-free, low-on-bezel finish and a combination of curved Gorilla Glass 5 and buffed metal that works well. 
The Mi 10’s buttons and ports are predictable; there’s a USB-C port, no headphone jack, but you do get an IR blaster at the top. The phone sports stereo speakers and all the buttons are along its right side.

I particularly like the Mi 10 Pro’s matte finish – it does a much better job than the high-gloss vanilla Mi 10 of fending off fingerprints. If I had to nitpick, the camera bump around the back could be a bit less pronounced, but in the context of today’s flagships, the design of the Mi 10 Pro is up there. The lack of an IP rating is also a big miss, especially at this price.
The phone’s screen also impresses in real life. While the Full HD specs and 386 pixel-per-inch clarity aren’t class-leading on-paper, we doubt you’ll be complaining when using it. Viewing angles are strong; decent brightness ensures the Mi 10 Pro looks good indoors and out, and with HDR10 support, optimised content appears immersive. 
With a small punch hole selfie camera in the top-right, the Mi 10 Pro is one of the most uninterrupted flagship screens around today, and its 90Hz refresh rate is smooth, even if it isn’t 120Hz Galaxy S20 smooth. 
Performance

Top-of-the-line specs inside
Snapdragon 865 chipset
Up to 12GB RAM

The entire Xiaomi Mi 10-series packs top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 internals, and the Mi 10 Pro comes loaded up with either 8GB RAM with 256GB storage, or 12GB RAM with 256/512GB storage. Our review device is the base 8GB/256GB model. Basically this has all bits you’d want from a best Android phone.
Benchmarks and real-world use predictably reflect the power inside the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro. A Geekbench multi-core score of 3,300 puts it near the top of the pack, and we experienced no stutters when using the phone, though occasionally, processing out those 108MP images can take a moment. 
Running atop Android 10, Xiaomi’s interface, MIUI 11 is our least favourite part of the Mi 10 Pro experience. A step in the right direction when compared to older iterations of MIUI, there are some things it gets right – finally, we have an optional apps tray. That said, it also gets plenty wrong.
Installing an app on the Mi 10 Pro pulls you through to a virus scanning screen, taking you away from whatever it is you’re doing. While this is an improvement over older iterations, which would bombard you with adverts in the process, it’s still jarring.

Want to select some text? Just double-tap it, right? That’s what you do in stock Android and in iOS. Nope – Xiaomi wants to be different. You have to double-tap it, then hit ‘select’ or long-press the text. Messing about with Android and UX fundamentals like this isn’t a smart move. 
There is also a bit of instability. The camera shutter release occasionally wouldn’t register presses, and some touch sensitivity issues forced me to lock and unlock the Mi 10 Pro to fix them. These issues were infrequent; however, held the user experience back, which is a real shame given everything else about this phone is so good. When this phone is in its element, it’s one of the best, but when wading through MIUI’s quirks, it’s just fine. 
There are also saving graces within MIUI too. Its home screens are simple to sort, and the interface generally looks clean. There are also plenty of customisation options, not least of all, the option to bring back an apps tray. Having spoken to several Mi 10 Pro reviewers, however, this was on some devices, but not others – so there are no guarantees that whatever lands on shelves when the phone goes on general release will have an apps tray. 
Biometric security is on-point with an under-display fingerprint scanner that works well, and standard connectivity options are accounted for – NFC, Bluetooth 5.1, aptX HD wireless codec, and more. 
Battery life

You’ll get better battery life than most 2020 flagships
50w wired and 30w wireless charging

The Mi 10 Pro delivers excellent battery life, bettering most 2020 flagships. An episode of This is Us, which clocks in at just shy of an hour only took the battery down by four percent at max brightness, and the phone made it through a full day with over 30 percent battery remaining most days with moderate use. 
On top of lasting all day, the Mi 10 Pro charges quickly, at up to 50W, which is faster than virtually any other smartphone that isn’t made by Oppo or Realme. With 30W fast wireless charging, not to mention reverse wireless charging.

Camera

There’s a main 108MP camera on the back
Two zoom cameras: 12MP 2x and 8MP 3.7x zoom

Contentious opinion alert: I prefer the camera on the Mi 10 Pro to that of the Galaxy S20 Ultra. Despite the fact both phones use the same 108MP sensor, made by Samsung, Xiaomi’s implementation and processing of images produce a more natural look. 
The setup on the Mi 10 Pro is very comparable to that of the S20 Ultra. The 108MP, f/1.7 primary camera is accompanied by a 12MP 2x zoom and an 8MP 3.7x zoom camera. The 108MP and 8MP modules pack OIS, and the telephoto performance of the Mi 10 Pro is exemplary. Add to the mix a 20MP ultrawide camera with a 13mm focal length, and the Mi 10 Pro fast becomes one of the most versatile camera phones on the scene. 
Pictures shot on Xiaomi’s flagship pack detail, depth, and excellent dynamic range in all but the most challenging conditions. Saturation and contrast are well balanced, though the images do lean towards cooler hues. 
The Mi 10 Pro’s optical image stabilisation saves the day in low light, and the inclusion of a Night Mode is welcome, helping dark scenes look naturally lit, though it’s a shame it can’t be fired up when engaging the ultrawide or 3.7x telephoto cameras.
Just like the S20-series, the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro captures up to 8K video, a neat party trick in excellent lighting, but it’s likely something you’ll use once and forget about. Fortunately, party tricks aside, its video capture is impressive, with plenty of modes to create fun, short video, and fundamentally reliable quality in good to middling light.
See below for a bunch of sample shots:
     
You should buy it if…
You want reliable internals
Xiaomi doesn’t skimp on the internals here, which isn’t a surprise considering the high price. You’ve got the 2020 flagship chipset from Qualcomm, 5G support, very fast charging and loads of RAM.
A zoom camera is important
The zoom skills of this camera phone are great and if you like getting closer to a subject this is a great pick.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want a water resistant phone
One of the few missing features here is the lack of an IP rating, meaning there’s no official water resistance here.

Verdict




























 



Like the classic football analogy, the Realme X3 Super Zoom is a phone of two halves. There’s a lot of eye-popping features here like the 120Hz display, periscope lens and 30w charging – all of which you’ll rarely find at this price.

But with real world use some things just don’t fall into place. The lack of 5G will annoy some, the camera needs to focus on what it wants to do best rather than try to do everything and the design doesn’t quite match the price-tag.



Pros

Matte back is a nice design touch
Loads of storage and a powerful processor
Zoom lens helps
Affordable



Cons

The camera can be unreliable
Macro camera pretty useless
Feels very plasticky
 No 5G support might annoy some

The Realme X3 Super Zoom is another high-powered, mid-range phone that wants to tempt you away from spending big bucks on true flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra.
It’s an interesting device that packs a hodge-podge of features, ranging from last year’s flagship Snapdragon chipset to a 120Hz LCD display. But, it’s the periscope-style zoom lens on the back that really makes it an interesting phone, especially when you consider the £469 price tag. This feature helps the X3 Superzoom to undercut other mid-priced offerings, like the OnePlus 8 or Moto Edge.

Design – The Realme X3 Super Zoom is a mixture of good and bad design
The Realme X3 Super Zoom is not a subtle phone. It feels much larger than competing handsets with the same size screen , notably the Moto Edge. So if you want something compact, it’s not the best choice.

It has a sizable 6.6-inch display, a hefty camera bump protruding from the back and heavily rounded sides. At 202g, it’s fairly heavy too.
That’s not to say it is ugly, because there are plenty of design elements here that are nice. My review unit has a pearly-white finish on the back which shimmers with a range of hues when light hits it. The back is matte too, so it doesn’t get covered in fingerprints or smudges after a few minutes of use.
The rim running around the sides looks, and feels, rather plasticky and this display juts out slightly giving it somewhat of a budget look. The X3 Super Zoom lacks any sort of IP rating, so don’t accidentally drop this phone in the bath. I guess sacrifices had to be made somewhere to reach the low price.

You’ve got a speaker on the bottom, USB-C port for data/charging along with a physical fingerprint scanner embedded inside the lock button. This is a similar design idea to the Sony Xperia 1 II and it again works well here. The fingerprint sensor is fast and large enough to give you plenty of space to press it. The reason for its inclusion seems to be the lack of the OLED panel, which renders in-display sensors far less common.
Throughout my couple of weeks with the phone I have found it to feel very durable and it hasn’t picked up marks or scratches. However, if you’d feel better using a case then there is a soft, silicone one in the box.
Screen – The Realme X3 Super Zoom has the most budget-friendly 120Hz display around
There are a number of features packed inside the Realme X3 that make it really stand out for its price. One of those is the display.
Like the far pricier OnePlus 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S20, the X3 Super Zoom has a 120Hz display – that’s double what most phones are at this price, and a third faster than the Xiaomi Mi 10 and OnePlus 8.
A faster refresh rate helps improve things in a variety of ways. For starters, it makes the the screen feel smoother when scrolling. It also helps with responsiveness when gaming. Since I started using 120Hz phones, I’ve found it really hard to go back to 60Hz (the iPhone 11 Pro, for example).
Having a 120Hz display is great and it’s very smooth on the X3. You can switch it down to 60Hz to save battery and enable an Auto mode that switches it up when it thinks you’ll need it. I’ve switched between full 120Hz and Auto mode during my time with the phone and it really is a benefit.
The rest of the display can’t quite match that illustrious spec. The 1080 x 2400 resolution is sharp, yet the use of LCD over OLED means blacks are muddy and there’s quite a lot of light bleed when you’re watching dark content. Viewing angles are not among the best and I found the auto-brightness struggled to properly jack things up when I was using the phone outside. There’s no HDR support either (hardly a surprise for an LCD device) but Netflix will play fine in HD.

I am also far from a fan of the dual-camera selfie cutout that really digs into the display and gets in the way when you’re viewing fullscreen content. This is a design element that was deemed annoying in 2019 and we’ve rarely seen it this year. You can get mostly used to it though, so for some, it won’t be an issue.
This is a good screen with a single great feature and if you’re after a 120Hz refresh rate on a budget you’re not going to find much better.
Performance and software – Last year’s flagship chipset makes a fast phone
Inside the Realme X3 Super Zoom is the Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset. This was Qualcomm’s top-tier silicone right up until the current 865 was announced in December 2019 and it remains a very capable chip.
This is an interesting move and one I assume was done to ensure the phone’s price could be kept down. You get just about better performance and benchmarks here than with the Moto Edge running on the Snapdragon 765G, but importantly you don’t get 5G. 
The lack of support for the next-gen mobile data network is one of the big downsides here and it’ll be something to note if you’re buying this to use for the next two years. You can get 5G phones at around this price and they’ll be a lot more of them coming out towards the end of this year and the beginning of next.
If you’re not fussed on 5G then you won’t be disappointed with the performance. Its performance is on par with the Galaxy Note 10 and I haven’t had trouble with any games or apps.
Realme hasn’t skimped on other internals, with 8 or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.0 storage. There is a 128GB model available too but beware, there’s no expandable storage here so choose your configuration wisely. One more missing feature is Wi-Fi 6 support – hardly a given on a flagship, let alone a phone that costs half the price of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus. 
That 120Hz display paired with a lot of RAM and a very fast, highly efficient chipset makes this the fastest overall phone you’ll find for less than £500.
Not everything is great, though. The speaker is muddled and tinny and call quality can be hit-or-miss.
I can’t say I am a huge fan of the Realme UI, though it’s still better than the skin you’ll find on Xiaomi phones. Quite a few features have been stripped from Google’s vision of Android (notably the Now panel and the search bars position) but Realme has redone all the app icons and redesigned both the notification panel and the settings area. 
Related: Best Android phone

There are a few preinstalled apps and most of all these are welcome and designed well. It’s nice to see a voice recording app and compass app included, though I can’t see anyone choosing to use the Music app.
Battery life – 30w charging is the highlight
Like the 120hz display, another typically flagship feature Realme has included here is 30w fast charging. I managed to get the depleted 4200mAh cell back to 100% in just over an hour, which is slightly more than the time Realme suggested.
As with any high refresh rate screen phone, the endurance varied a lot depending on how you use it. With the auto mode selected and with what I would consider heavy use, I usually ended the day with about 20% juice left. I was getting closer to 10% if I left it on 120Hz.  Considering how quickly the phone charged I didn’t worry about the battery life and while it doesn’t set  a new standard for longevity, it can’t be described as anything other than good.
There isn’t any wireless charging though, and you’ll need to use the included plug to get those speeds. A more common USB-C PD power got me from 0-100% in roughly 100 minutes.
Camera – Not enough focus
The real highlight of the X3 Super Zoom, on paper at least, is the zoom skills of the camera. Realme clearly agrees; this is called the Super Zoom after all.
You get 5x optical zoom on the 8-megapixel sensor thanks to some periscope trickery, plus a 64MP f/1.8 main sensor, an 8MP ultrawide and  2MP macro.
I have found camera quality across all cameras to be very hit-and-miss. Snaps from the main sensor are usually the most reliable, with nice, if very saturated, colours and plenty of detail. There’s a dedicated mode for shooting at 64MP but this removes the zooming skills and can lead to some issues with focusing.
The secondary cameras, zoom lens aside, are merely window-dressing. The macro sensor is largely pointless and I would prefer it to be left off and the price dropped further. The ultrawide takes ok landscapes in good lighting but suffers from blurring around the edges.
The 8MP zoom camera itself is nice to have, even if the fairly low-resolution sensor leads to some soft photos. Having that periscope lens does improve the zoom when compared to phones that use purely digital cropping though, and it’s very usable.

2x zoom
5x zoom
Also an example of 5x zoom
The 64MP sensor can capture detailed shots
You’ve got two more cameras around the front: 32MP main and a wider 8MP. Again, they’re fine – even if they tend to smooth out details a little too much for my liking. It’s a similar situation with the video features which you can shoot up to 4K 60fps thanks to the Snapdragon 855 Plus.
I think there’s too much going on with this camera without enough proper focus. If the headline is meant to be the zoom then ditch the needless macro and sacrifice the ultrawide to make the zoom the very best it can be. I think the software and backend need some work too as it’s hard to get reliably good photos even though it seems the hardware is there.
Should you buy the Realme X3 Super Zoom?
Like the classic football analogy, the Realme X3 Super Zoom is a phone of two halves. There’s a lot of eye-popping features here like the 120Hz display, periscope lens and 30w charging – all of which you’ll rarely find at this price.

Yet in actual use some things just don’t fall into place. The lack of 5G will annoy some and not bother others, the camera needs to focus on what it wants to do best rather than try to do everything and the design doesn’t quite match the price-tag.

Verdict


































LG’s new design language works very well here and this looks a lot better than LG’s last few efforts. There’s a lot to like with the camera array, specs and feature list too, even if the software lacks polish.



Pros

Cons
60Hz panel feels dated compared to the competitionSome odd performance issuesCameras are nothing special

LG has had a tough time trying to distinguish its handsets from the ever-increasing best Android phone crowd recently. Its previous attempts haven’t been bad – I liked the LG V60 ThinQ quite a lot – they’ve just lacked a certain spark.
With the LG Velvet, the Korean brand is trying something different – at least when it comes to the design. This isn’t bulky or industrial like the V60 line, quite the opposite.
Design and screen – The LG Velvet is a step in the right direction
From the smooth finish to the curved sides and the near-flush camera sensors that almost drip down the rear, this is an eye-catching phone that looks so much better than LG’s other recent attempts. 
I’m not going to say it’s totally unique as there are a lot of phones using this overall design, but that doesn’t take anything away from LG and when sat next to the bulky, hulking LG V60, there’s plenty of obvious improvements.
Like most other Android phones these days, the Velvet is big. The heavy curves and fairly thin rim make it one of the more slippery out there too, but it does feel light. It’s got some serious durable skills, like an IP rating and MIL-STD compliance, plus a rare headphone port next to the charging connector on the bottom. But be warned, while the headphone port remains in place, the excellent quad-DAC from the V60 isn’t.
Screen tech is where the Velvet falls down most against some of its rivals. And that’s not because the panel is bad. It’s because the display lacks some of the newer tech you’ll find in the Moto Edge, OnePlus 8 and Xiaomi Mi 10. 
Unlike those phones, the LG Velvet lacks a 90Hz refresh rate meaning the display isn’t as smooth and responsive. Still, the OLED panel is bright, runs to the edges with just a small cutout for the camera and looks sharp enough thanks to the FHD+ resolution. You’ll find support for HDR content in YouTube and Netflix too.
Once again LG is pairing its flagship Android phone with an add-on Dual Screen case that’s included with the handset (this might vary by region, but the V60 ThinQ wasn’t sold without the case). The peripheral adds another display, in addition to an extra layer of protection. While this might kill off the new design vibes and remove the thin finish, it’s the best Dual Screen case yet.
The case mimics the specs of the display and lets you move apps to it, expand certain features across both displays. You can even use the second panel as a gamepad. 

It’s a nice trick and if you’ve been a fan of Dual Screen skills before you’ll like it again here. It still lacks the developer support to be taken really seriously and apps that I feel would take serious advantage of the bookish form-factor – namely the Kindle app – don’t work too well. The full screen keyboard that takes over the panel is also poor, and you can’t swap it out for anything else.
Still, it’s a novel addition for a mid-range phone that really does help set the Velvet apart from much of the competition.

Performance and software – It’s not always smooth sailing
Like other ‘premium’ mid-rangers including the OnePlus 8 and Moto Edge, the LG Velvet doesn’t skimp on internals. Though I do wish a couple of areas were given more love.
Powering the phone is the very capable Snapdragon 765G chipset. This is the same chip you’ll find in the Moto Edge and while I found performance on the Edge fantastic, the story here isn’t as rosy. Throughout my time with the Velvet it has experienced a few bouts of poor performance, from slow load times in apps to stuttering when scrolling through webpages.
The 60Hz display, rather than the faster 90Hz version you’ll find on phones like the Moto Edge and Xiaomi Mi 10, adds to the occasional feeling of slowness. I was quite surprised when the lag hit too, as it’s certainly not all the time. Games seem to play admirably and most apps open and load perfectly quickly. So maybe this is something that could be ironed out in software updates.
It’s a 5G-ready (sub-6, rather than mmWave) device and it’s great to see this next-gen connectivity continuing to come to more affordable phones. RAM varies by region in either 6 or 8GB variants and there’s a set 128GB internal storage which can be expanded via microSD cards.
LG might have worked on the hardware a lot for the Velvet, but the software feels a little less polished. LG’s UX has long been one of my least favourite Android variations and it feels lacking when compared to Samsung’s One UI. 
The icons are childish, the menus are clogged up and the heavy use of strong translucency effects feel very old-fashioned. If LG is stringently against following Sony and Motorola and using the default Android look (just with some extra added apps) then this needs a proper overhaul.
At least the software has some good features. The system-wide search works very well and the Google Now pane sits on the left-most homescreen.
Battery life – The LG Velvet should last you the day
Battery life on the LG Velvet is adequate and throughout my weeks with the phone I have been getting upwards of five hours of screen on time. This should get most people comfortably through the day without too much trouble.
There’s no high refresh rate or quad-HD panel to suck up the juice and the 4200mAh cell is large enough to handle multiple hours of gaming.
The charging here isn’t the fastest as LG simply uses the Quick Charge 4+ standard from Qualcomm. A full charge takes on average two hours and this can be double what I would expect from a phone using a proprietary charging solution, like OnePlus or Oppo.
As the Dual Screen case is powered by this same cell, heavy usage will kill the battery in the Velvet faster. You’ll also have to use the special magnetic adaptor to charge the phone up while it’s in the case.
The glass back allows for Qi wireless charging and this is a feature that’s good to see kept around on a mid-range phone. You find this on the OnePlus 8 or Xiaomi Mi 10.

Camera – LG Velvet compares to other mid-priced options without really impressing 
Mid-priced (we’re talking in the £/$400-600 market) devices have come a long way in a few years. But their camera skills are yet to really progress. Like the OnePlus 8, Realme X3 Super Zoom and Moto Edge, the camera smarts of the LG Velvet are nothing spectacular. While the photos taken are more than adequate for social media, they lack punch and the depth you’d get with a pricier phone like the iPhone 11 or Samsung Galaxy S20. If pictures are top of your wish list then you’re still better off paying more or going with the iPhone SE 2 or Pixel 3a. 
The camera array consists of a main 48-megapixel sensor that can shoot 4K video at 30fps, a secondary 5MP depth sensor (never convinced about how useful these are) and a welcome 8MP ultrawide. I am happy to see LG hasn’t added the near-useless macro camera that you’ll find on the OnePlus 8 and Realme X3 Super Zoom.
Colours lack the punch of the true hue (this wall is actually a far stronger yellow)
Snaps are bright and can be colourful, with ok details from that pixel-packed main sensor. The ultrawide is a bit smoother than the higher-priced rivals but that’s common with phones around this price and so it’s to be expected.
The detail is there, even if the colours are a bit washed out

Around the front there’s a 16MP selfie camera that also works for face unlock if you’d rather not use the in-display fingerprint scanner.
Photos just tend to look very flat, with little dynamic range. This is especially noticeable when you’re shooting landscapes. Low-light snaps are hit-and-miss too, even if you’re using the Night View mode.
Details up close look good
The camera app is at least fully-featured, though sometimes that can make it feel overwhelming and it does suffer slowdown if you quickly scroll between options. I like that Google Lens is built directly in and the manual camera option is always nice to have. You’ve got more gimmicky skills like an ASMR recording mode, 3D AR stickers (which really slow things down) and portrait mode.

Should you buy the LG Velvet?
It’s not the most complete phone, but the LG Velvet is a good alternative if you’re against going full-on flagship. The addition of the Dual Screen case and the sleek design makes this a good start in the next generation of LG’s Android phones.
It also benefits from a hefty feature list, with plenty left in that normally get the chop when price is involved. Wireless charging, for instance, an IP rating and a headphone jack all make a welcome appearance. 
Related: Best Android phones
There are certain areas that could be improved though. A faster screen would be nice, though not if it came at the loss of the Dual Screen, and a thorough software reboot should still be a high priority.
Camera performance is mixed too and if photography is still your number one request on a new phone then you’re still going to have to spend more.
LG has embraced the mid-range with the Velvet and it’s a good first step that feels far more distinct than any of the brand’s recent flagship devices.

The Moto G Pro is Motorola’s latest entry into its iconic affordable phone range. Like the Gs before it, the Pro aims to offer buyers specs and features traditionally seen on significantly pricier handsets.
What separates the Pro from the Moto G8 Plus and Moto G8 Power, is the inclusion of a Galaxy Note-like Stylus and addition of Android One software.
This, plus a solid specs sheet – considering its affordable price – make the Moto G Pro one of the best value smartphones available at the moment.
The only downside is that with Qualcomm’s entry level 5G chips now out, its time in the sun could be very short as it’s highly likely we’ll see a fresh wave of affordable phones with the next-gen connectivity appear in the very near future.
Related: Best affordable phone

Design – The Moto G Pro has a NOTE-worthy look
The Moto G Pro looks a lot like pretty much every other Moto G we’ve reviewed over the last couple of years. Specifically, it has a slightly shiny plastic back, which houses the phone’s rear facing triple-camera and fingerprint reader. The addition of a fingerprint scanner is a little retro by flagship standards, where in-screen is the vogue, but that’s the only thing that marks the Moto G Pro as affordable from the outside.
Measuring in at 158.55 × 75.8 × 9.2 mm the phone is suitably slim and noticeably thinner than many of the competing affordable phones I’ve tested. Coupled with the phone’s 192g weight, the dimensions and slight curvature make the Pro suitably comfortable to hold. The only downside is that the shiny back can become slippery to hold in damp conditions and is an outright dust magnet.
This isn’t too big of a deal as the lack of a formal IP water resistance rating means you’ll want to avoid using it in moist conditions from the get-go. Having accidentally spilled a glass of wine on my review unit I can also attest that Motorola’s “water repellent” description is accurate, as the Pro kept merrily running after a quick mop-up. Build quality is otherwise excellent and an included case adds a further layer of drop protection for particularly accident prone users.
Flipping the phone over, you’ll also notice it has a hole-punch front camera housing that’s similar to the one you’ll find on Samsung’s Galaxy S20 line. Look at the phone’s bottom and you’ll spot its most unique feature – a dockable S Pen-like stylus. The pen sits in a dock next to the Moto G Pro’s USB C charge port and 3.5mm headphone jack. The stylus on paper works the same way as the S Pen and lets you take physical notes on the phone.
Performance – Solid specs and great software for the price
Under the hood Motorola’s also made a few subtle upgrades to the Pro, the biggest addition being NFC connectivity. Though this is common on higher-end phones, the connectivity is still not guaranteed in the budget end of the market. This makes the Pro a great choice for people that regularly use G-Pay when shopping.
Outside of this, the specs are competitive for a phone with the Moto G Pro’s asking price, but not groundbreaking.
The phone features a 6.4-inch, FHD+ resolution (2300 x 1080), IPS display with a 19.17:9 aspect ratio. The use of an IPS panel is fairly common on a phone this price, and means blacks aren’t anywhere near as deep as those found on more expensive handsets, which favour OLED technology.
But, it’s still pretty darned good considering the price. The size makes the phone more than big enough for web browsing, gaming and watching videos. The resolution also ensures that text and icons are sharp enough. Colours are a little warm for my liking out of the box, but not to the point it’s an actual annoyance. The only serious compromises you’ll find are that it doesn’t feature any form of HDR support and has a basic 60Hz refresh rate. But at this price, what do you expect?
The stylus, for the most part, works great. Pop the pen out of the phone’s bottom and an icon will appear with shortcuts to useful services like sketch, screen grab and Moto Memos. The pen feels fairly accurate and works great for quick notes. But there are a few compromises. For starters it doesn’t feature as many pressure sensitivity levels as the S Pen. Palm detection is also lacking, making it a little too easy to accidentally enact commands when writing. But considering the phone’s price these omissions are forgivable.
The memo’s service is also one of the only additions Motorola has made to the phone’s Android software. Like most Motorola phones, the Moto G Pro’s clean Android install is a key selling point you won’t find on competing affordable phones from the likes of Huawei, Honor and Xiaomi. Being part of the Android One programme means the OS is pretty much left exactly as Google intended it. There’s no bloatware, duplicate applications or pointless UI changes to be found on the Moto G Pro. But more importantly, the Android One label means the G Pro will be updated to the next version of Android, a guarantee you won’t get with most affordable phones.
The clean install also helps the phone get the most out of its Snapdragon 665 CPU. Paired with 4GB of RAM this puts the phone ahead of some Mediatek powered rivals, like the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9. But the phone is still far from being a powerhouse.
General scrolling and web browsing is smooth enough, though on occasion you will notice a minor delay navigating between menus. The phone’s also fast enough to play most games, though don’t expect Asphalt, PUBG and CoD Mobile to run at max graphical settings. My real world findings were reflected in its synthetic benchmark scores.
In Geekbench 5 the phone ran in with 312 single-core and 1356 multi-core scores. These put it slightly ahead of the Redmi Note 9 which ran in with a Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 1310.
The only serious downside to the chipset relates to timing. Qualcomm’s just unveiled a new generation of 6-series Snapdragon chips featuring advanced 5G connectivity. This means we will likely see a new wave of 5G-capable affordable phones in the not too distant future, a factor that severely hinders the Pro’s long-term future as a best in class affordable phone.

Camera – 48-megapixels and strong performance
The Moto G Pro uses the same 48-megapixel main camera lens as the Redmi Note 9, and pretty much every other phone to hit stores this year. It’s paired with basic macro and 117 degree ultra-wide secondary and tertiary lenses.
For performance using the out of the box main lens auto mode, which captures 12-megapixel shots, the G Pro takes good photos for a phone at its price. The laser autofocus is nippy and ensures you’re never waiting too long between pressing the on screen shutter button and the image being captured. In regular light images are suitably clean and aren’t overprocessed.
But, like all phones this price, low light performance is a mixed bag, even when using the dedicated night mode. The G Pro can take usable photos in low light. But their quality doesn’t match even moderately more expensive handsets. In dim conditions light sources are over-exposed and on occasion noise does creep in. However, this is an issue on all sub-£300 and you won’t find a better main camera on a phone at this price.
The only serious downside is that Motorola hasn’t set the phone up to take advantage of ultra-wide. Despite having the ultra-wide, there’s no dedicated single shot wide-angle option in the camera app, which is a pain.

Battery life – More than a day, less than two
The Moto G Pro is powered by a 4000mAh battery and supports 15 W TurboPower charging. This means it’s distinctly in the middle of the pack when it comes to capacity and charge speeds. With real world use this is also the case. Using the Moto G Pro as my main work and personal phone I generally managed to get a day and half’s use out of it.
A regular day entailed listening to music during my morning workout, taking and making a few calls throughout the day, regularly checking my social media and email feeds, streaming a few videos on Youtube and a half hour’s gaming on GeForce Now with the Razer Kishi before bed.
More intensive tasks do put a bigger drain on the battery, however. Looping video with the screen set to 50% brightness, the Moto G Pro lost around 10% of its charge per hour, which is fairly standard. Gaming put a much bigger dent on the phone’s battery. Playing games on the Play Store it lost around 20-25% of its charge. Streaming on Stadia and GeForce Now, it went from full to zero charge in less than three hours. These figures aren’t terrible, they’re just distinctly average.

Should you buy the Moto G Pro?
If you’re on a strict budget and need a new phone this very second, then the Moto G Pro is an excellent option. The Moto G Pro is one of the best phones you’ll find for less than £300, featuring a solid main camera, decent specs, a useful stylus and a wonderfully clean Android install.
The only drawback is that with Qualcomm’s new affordable 5G chips now out, it’s not terribly future proof and you’ll likely want to upgrade again in less than a year when the new connectivity becomes more standard.

Verdict





























 



With its big screen, big pixel-count, and large battery the Redmi Note 9 will likely scratch your flagship itch on a budget. Sure, it won't stack up to pricier smartphones in terms of design, camera zoom, low light imaging, or power, but for the price, it's still a winner, despite a few UI gremlins. 




Pros

Great battery life
Competitive camera
Big, bright screen



Cons

Plastic frame
No telephoto camera
MIUI can be clunky

The Xiaomi Redmi  Note 9 is one of the brand’s latest budget smartphones, but is it as good as the tough competition?
There are plenty of decent phones that cost between £179 and £220, not least of all the Xiaomi made Redmi Note 8T, 2019’s sensational budget champion. Since Redmi launched the 8T, however, Honor has launched the Honor 9X, and Motorola’s entire Moto G8-family has dropped across price points.
Halfway through 2020 and Xiaomi hopes to claw back its budget crown with the Redmi Note 9, a £200 quad-camera smartphone with a big screen, big battery, and big pixel-count. MediaTek internals and plastic build highlight how Xiaomi keeps costs down, but do these factors hold it back from being excellent for the price? 
Design and screen – Well protected plastic
If you want a big-screened smartphone on a budget, the Redmi Note 9 could well fit the bill. At an ample 6.53-inches, it’s larger than the 6.46-inch-screened iPhone 11 Pro Max.
The phone’s design takes cues from Huawei’s Mate 20-series, swapping out the premium trimmings for plastic, and for the price, it looks good. It is a touch chunkier and clunkier than similarly priced phones from Motorola and Oppo, though. 
The USB-C port at the bottom is bookended by a mono speaker and a headphone jack. All the buttons are on the right, and there’s an IR blaster at the top – something you seldom see at this price. 
In-hand, as big as the phone is, its curved back helps it nuzzle into palms comfortably, and it’s also well-weighted. The fingerprint scanner around the back is well-positioned and quick to unlock.
While the screen is protected by both Gorilla Glass 5 and a pre-fitted screen protector, the back is plastic; notoriously less crackable than glass, but more scratchable. Thankfully, Xiaomi ships a case with the Redmi Note 9, which comes complete with a USB port cover. 

As for the screen, at 6.53 inches and clocking in at wide 1080p resolution, the Note 9 is sharp – beating out the 720p Moto G8, and the LCD tech pulls through for the most part. 
Maximum brightness isn’t anywhere near flagship-grade, so in the brightest conditions, you might struggle. Naturally, compared to OLEDs, the screen’s a touch washed out, but given its price, viewing angles, vibrancy, and the overall experience are respectable.
Performance and software – Redmi Note 9 has respectable power for the price, but unavoidable bloatware holds it back
Running with a MediaTek Helio G85, the Redmi Note 9 is anything but a powerhouse. We are reviewing the 4GB/128GB version, and benchmark results are predictably middling.
The Note 9 achieved a Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 1310, matching the kind of power you’d get from a 2016/2017 flagship. Interestingly, last year’s Note 8T benchmarks slightly better, so if you have one and are after a speed bump then this won’t be it. 
In real-world use, however, the Note 9 delivers respectable performance given the price and additional specs on offer. There are occasional judders, both throughout the UI and when 3D gaming. 
That said, the Note 9 was up to the task of running everything we wanted to play, from 2D titles like Valkyrie profile through to 3D games like Asphalt 9 and Disney Arena, even if it wasn’t always silky smooth. 
Photos are quick to take and working across multiple apps and even split-screening was smooth most of the time.

That being said, Xiaomi’s software is still a compromise on one too many levels. Despite being stable, with excellent app support thanks to Google Play Store access, occasional gremlins pop up.
For starters, MIUI doesn’t give users the option of loading up an apps tray which will turn some off. Additionally, when installing an app, MIUI scans it for viruses (great) but you’re served an advert while the scan takes place, which is a gross user experience. 
You can disable this  – but it’s a bit of a faff. Add to the mix the fact the phone we reviewed included around ten third-party apps worth of bloatware, and despite the great value on offer here, the Redmi Note 9 is held back from compromise-free excellence.
Camera – Avoid the macro camera and you’ll be laughing
With an identical camera set-up to that of the Redmi Note 8T, the Note 9 impresses with a wide and ultra-wide combo. Instead of the telephoto camera you’ll see on higher-end smartphones, you get a macro camera and a depth sensor complementing the main sharpshooters. 
The primary camera packs a generous 48MP pixel count combined with an f/1.8, 26mm wide-angle lens. Meanwhile, the 8MP ultra-wide features a 118-degree field-of-view, and an f/2.2 lens. Both of these perform well when it comes to clarity, grabbing sharp pictures that look good in well-lit conditions. 
The inclusion of a night mode means even shots taken in middling light can look decent, though dark scenes which phones like the Huawei P40 Pro Plus, iPhone 11 Pro and Pixel 4 could handle are too tall an order for the Redmi Note 9.
Shots are taken at 12MP by default, and there’s a 48MP mode, along with a range of standard shooting modes, including 120fps slow motion, short video, portrait, panorama and pro mode. The main camera captures video at 1080p resolution – inferior to the 4K video captured by last year’s Note 8T, but footage is well stabilised, and looks clean when the light is right.
As for the macro camera, it has a few white balance issues and captures low resolution, 2MP images loaded up with image noise, so it’s best avoided. Meanwhile, the 13MP selfie camera does a perfectly decent job for the price, even in backlit conditions. 
Check out the sample shots below:



Battery life – The Redmi Note 9 lasts for ages
With a massive 5020mAh battery, it’s little wonder that the Note 9 powers through a full day without any issues. 
Despite its big screen, screen-on time is impressive, with 10 minutes of streaming video at full brightness dropping the battery by only 2%, and a full hour draining it by 10%. This means even if you’re planning on getting through a few episodes, WiFi hot-spotting and gaming when out and about, the Note 9 will be more than up to the task.

Xiaomi’s latest budget phone also charges quickly for a phone of its price, with an 18W charger shipping in the box. 
In terms of connections and storage, the Note 9’s very well specced, with up to 128GB inside and a card slot, not to mention NFC, a responsive fingerprint scanner at the back and an IR blaster up top, so the phone doubles up as a TV remote control.
Should you buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9?
The Redmi Note 9 delivers, even if it imperfections. The huge screen, masses of storage, high-resolution camera system and fast charging do enough to make it stand out at its price for the right reasons.

And these are the best mid-range phones

It isn’t quite the value shake-up that last year’s Redmi Note 8T was, but it’s still a great shout, especially for anyone who values excellent battery life and across-the-board value for money.

Verdict





























 



If you’re an avid gamer, early GeForce Now subscriber or regularly use your phone to stream videos then the Black Shark 3 Pro is a solid handset. Its giant 7.1-inch screen and custom “Master Controller” shoulder buttons make it feel more like a mobile console than a traditional handset, especially when you pair it with the firm’s optional gaming peripherals.



Pros

Great screen
Good value
Loads of decent gaming features



Cons

Design will put non-gamers off






Key Specifications

Review Price: £799
7.1-inch AMOLED 4120 x 1440 resolution, 90Hz screen
Snapdragon 865 CPU
8/12GB RAM
5000mAh battery
256GB storage
Android 9 with Black Shark skin


The Black Shark 3 Pro is the current flagship in the Xiaomi mobile gaming subsidiary’s lineup.
It sits above the regular Black Shark 3 and comes with a number of custom design features you won’t find in any other smartphone. Chief of which is custom “Master Trigger” inputs.
The controls aren’t perfect, but coupled with the phone’s sizeable, high refresh rate screen and competitive starting price, they add up to make the Black Shark 3 Pro one of the best phones around, and an ideal choice for “hardcore” gamers.
Its marmite design and heft will put off many regular phone users (if this is you, check out our best phone and best Android phone lists), who will be better off investing in the OnePlus 8 or one of Xiaomi’s non-gaming handsets, however.

Design – For the gamers
Gaming phones are never subtle. But the Black Shark 3 Pro takes things to a new level. The 7-inch device would have been classed as a tablet half a decade ago – held back-to-back it’s nearly the same height as first-gen Nexus 7.
The phone otherwise looks a lot like its smaller sibling, the Black Shark 3, featuring a custom “X Core” design. This brings with it the best and worst of gaming hardware design tropes. Specifically, it means that the back of the phone has a distinctly ROG like accents and two diamond-shaped housings on its back.
The latter houses the phone’s triple sensor camera array and a magnetic connector for the phone’s optional magnetic charge cable. This, plus the RGB lighting Black Shark’s coated the phone with means the Pro is about as unsubtle as a phone can get.
Sadly, like the regular Black Shark 3, despite being very solidly built, and suitably durable to survive an accidental drop onto a hardwood floor, the handset doesn’t have any formal IP rating. This is a common compromise on £400-£600 handsets as getting the certification is an expensive process that ramps up the phone’s final RRP. But it means you’ll want to avoid any aquatic adventures, or using the handset in the pouring rain.

Due to its size, the Pro also doesn’t work with most non-Black Shark peripherals, like the stellar Razer Kishi. Though considering how good Black Shark’s own gamepad and cooler add-ons are this isn’t a huge deal.
Outside of this the Pro ticks all the right boxes you’d expect a flagship gaming phone to..
Like the regular Black Shark 3, there’s a custom switch on the phone’s side that lets you activate the firm’s Shark Space 3.0 software. This is to all intents a custom game mode where you can customise RGB light patterns and create custom profiles for specific games. This is particularly important on the Pro as it also activates the phone’s most unique feature: its Master Triggers.
These are pop up shoulder buttons that are housed in the phone’s top long side. They may sound like a gimmick, but paired with the Shark Space software they’re actually pretty awesome. The controls have a wonderfully tactile feel and pleasing click mechanism when you hit their actuation point.
They’re also an outright boon when playing online competitive shooters like PUBG and CoD Mobile, thanks to their easy to setup software. In Shark Space all you have to do is activate the Master Trigger control menu and drag on-screen icons to the input you want them to register for the game you’re playing.

The Pro’s custom cooling system and atypical antenna placement round off its gamer focussed feature set.
It has the same “Sandwich Liquid Cooling” system as the regular Black Shark 3. This places two super long cooling pipes in a doubled sided structure that the firm claims is 100% larger and 50% more efficient than the one seen on the Black Shark 2.
The “dual X” antenna design litters ten antennas around the phone’s sides in a custom setup the firm claims improves connectivity when using the phone in landscape.
As before, the two systems work well. During testing, I’ve never noticed any CPU throttling, even when playing games on GeForce Now for hours at a time and I’ve not had any serious signal dropouts. The only downside is that, due to the ongoing lockdown, I haven’t had a chance to test the Black Shark 3 Pro’s 5G connectivity.
Display – One of the biggest phone screens around
The Black Shark 3 features a giant 7.1-inch AMOLED 4120 x 1440 resolution screen. Like the regular Black Shark 3 the screen features a 90Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support.
The 90Hz rate doesn’t match the 120Hz seen on Samsung’s current Galaxy S20 line, but like the regular Black Shark 3, it’s still a serious boon for games and a massive step forward on the 60Hz seen on most regular phones.
The key selling point for games will be its 270Hz touch reporting rate and 24ms touch latency, however. For non-techies, the combination of refresh and polling rate, means the Black Shark 3 and Black Shark 3 Pro have two of the most responsive screens on the market and are brilliant for gaming. Moving from the Black Shark 3 Pro back to a Galaxy S20 Plus, the latter felt a fraction slower playing PUBG. This is a serious achievement, albeit one only gamers will enjoy.
Outside of this, the screen is fairly good, albeit not best in class. Colours out of the box are a little overcooked, but not to the point that it’s a massive problem and the HDR10+ support, coupled with the screen’s giant dimensions, make it great for binge-watching Amazon Prime and Netflix content, if you turn its video upscaling off that is.
This is an annoying feature that’s also on the regular Black Shark 3. It forces content to play at 90Hz. This creates a soap opera effect that makes Oscar-worthy movies look like early 90s sitcoms or an episode of neighbours. Thankfully you can easily turn it off in the phone’s “cinema mode” settings menu.
The two front facing stereo speakers also perform admirably. They don’t have the same bass extension as the ruling Razer Phone 2, but they’re loud and powerful enough to watch movies and play games with. Though as always a decent set of headphones or Bluetooth speaker will be the way to go if you want a truly immersive experience.
Performance and Software – The Black Shark 3 is blazing fast
The Black Shark 3 Pro runs using the same Snapdragon 865 chip found in most of 2020’s flagships, including the regular Black Shark 3. Backed up by 8/12GB of RAM this means the Black Shark 3 is blisteringly fast and easily matches the performance of competing flagships.
After three weeks with the handset I’ve not noticed any slow down and been able to run every game I’ve tested with their graphics maxed with no issue.
Webs and apps open in milliseconds and, all-in-all, I haven’t noticed any performance issues using the Black Shark 3 Pro as my main phone.
The handset’s synthetic benchmark scores mirrored my real-world findings.
Gaming phones software usually mirrors their physical designs. In general, they feature horrible Android skins full of duplicate apps and garish icons that aren’t anywhere near as elegant or pleasant to look at as Android’s native versions. This largely remains the case on the Black Shark 3 Pro which features the same JoyUI 11 skin loaded over Android 10 as its non-pro sibling.
The skin adds a few useful gaming features, like Shark Space and is a lot less intrusive than the ROG Phone’s custom skin. But it still makes more superfluous UI changes than I’d like. It’s also guilty of loading duplicate apps and needlessly changing icons.

Camera – Great for a gaming phone
The Black Shark 3 Pro comes with the same triple camera setup as its smaller sibling. This means round back you’ll find 13-megapixel ultra-wide, 5-megapixel bokeh and 64-megapixel clear (main) lenses.
The app also remains unchanged and features the same selection of modes. These include auto, portrait, pro, night and panorama. There’s also a custom 64-megapixel option that lets you capture outright gigantic photos.
Performance is great by gaming phone standards and average for flagships as a result. Out of the box photos taken on any lens are a step up on what you’d get from the ROG Phone 2 or Razer Phone 2. They’re sharper, feature better autofocus, contrast levels and more realistic colours. All-in-all they’re more than good enough for sharing on social media.
But, they don’t match the quality of the OnePlus 8 or Galaxy S20. This is particularly true in low light. Even using the bespoke low light mode, the Pro’s autofocus is noticeably longer than its non-gaming rivals. Noise creeps in and it overexposes light sources in dim conditions. Like the non-pro version the 64-megapixel setting also has a tendency to overprocess shots compared to its non-gaming competition.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the Black Shark 3 Pro below.
  
Battery life – Huge cell and fast charging
The Pro’s powered by a sizeable 5000mAh battery and supports lightning quick 65W fast charging.
Black Shark claims the phone’s also more stable than competitors thanks to a custom “dual battery system and chipset, which let it go from 0-100% battery in 38 minutes and 50% charge in 12.
With real-world use battery life is solid. Using the Black Shark 3 Pro as my main phone it easily lasted between one to two days of regular use.
This entailed constantly checking the internet and incoming alerts, taking a few Zoom calls, listening to music through the workday and playing some games over GeForce Now for an hour in the evening.
Multimedia performance is particularly impressive. Streaming video over Wi-Fi on Netflix with the screen on 50% brightness the Black Shark 3 Pro lost an average of 6-8% of its battery per hour.
Playing games, the phone lost between 12-18% of its charge per hour. Both results are impressive and make the handset a great option for regular mobile movie streamers and gamers.

Should you buy the Black Shark 3 Pro?
If you’re an avid gamer, early GeForce Now subscriber or regularly use you phone to stream videos then the Black Shark 3 Pro is a solid handset. Its giant 7.1-inch screen and custom “Master Controller” shoulder buttons make it feel more like a mobile console than a traditional handset, especially when you pair it with the firm’s optional gaming peripherals.
Its pure heft and distinctly 90s gamer design will put off regular buyers however. These people will be better off investing in a non-gaming phone like the OnePlus 8 or Galaxy S20, which both have better cameras.

Verdict





























 



It packs a nice design, plenty of clever touches (headphone port on a flagship feels almost novel at the point) and great software. Save for the £1000/$1000 price, this is Sony’s best phone for a number of years.



Pros

Fast focussing
A lovely screen
Great manual camera apps



Cons

Very expensive, especially compared to what else is on the market
Other phones take better pictures in auto mode






Key Specifications

Review Price: £1099
6.5-inch 4K HDR OLED 21:9 display
Snapdragon 865, 8GB RAM
4000mAh battery
3 x 12-megapixel rear cameras
Alpha camera apps
256GB storage



The Sony Xperia 1 II is Sony’s best phone in years. It takes inspiration from some of the brand’s biggest products and melds them into a phone that feels very different from the usual Android competition.
With the 4K OLED display that takes some skills from the Bravia line to the Alpha-inspired triple camera array, this is a Sony phone through-and-through.
But are these features simply tacking on a well-known brand for the sake of it? Or do they make for a winning combination?
Design and Screen

Can display certain content in 4K
Tall 21:9 display
Plenty of customisation options for playing back video

Sony isn’t rewriting the rulebook when it comes to phone design with the Xperia 1 II. The boxy rectangle and 21:9 display lead to a very tall phone, however it’s narrower and easier to clutch than, say, the iPhone 11 Pro Max. You will need to stretch your thumb a bit to reach the top of the screen, unless you want to utilise the handy one-handed mode. 
You’ll find the headphone jack on the top, the fingerprint-sensing power button on the side and the SIM tray on the opposite side. This SIM tray just pulls out without the need for a tool; handy if you change SIMS or SD cards on the regular. It’s IP68-rated for water resistance too and is one of the few phones to keep the multi-press camera shutter button around.
I know lots of people appreciate this shutter button, but its positioning means my thumb often accidentally rests on it when I am holding the phone.
While it’s a very clean phone to look at, I would have preferred a matte back finish rather than the smudgy glass in play here.
The Sony Xperia 1 II is one of the best phones around when it comes to the display, at least on paper and if you’re a fan of watching lots media, be it Netflix or YouTube, on your phone then there is lots here to get you excited.
It remains the only phone out there with a 6.5-inch 4K screen, boasting HDR 10-bit colour support and an OLED panel. It also eschews the notch completely – giving you an uninterrupted 21:9 display that is properly immersive.
One spec you will notice is missing from the bumper list is a 90 or 120Hz panel – a feature common on just about every other 2020 flagship, especially those that cost as much as this. Now, Sony has introduced some motion smoothing tricks which can give the impression of a faster refresh rate in certain instances, however it’s not as successful as a true 120Hz panel.
So, is 4K a worthy replacement for this faster panel? I do like how Sony is doing things differently here and not following the usual mold set by other Android phones. I don’t say this often very but the Xperia 1 II feels unique, and the 4K display is part of that attraction. In usual day-to-day use, I doubt you’ll notice the extra pixels and that’s whether you’re coming from a phone with a quad-HD display or even 1080p. 
Fire up a YouTube video that is uploaded at full 2160p resolution and you do notice the extra clarity and sharpness over the competition. For most people, the difference will be minimal – but for those who this phone is aimed at will appreciate it. I do wish apps like Netflix, Prime Video and Play Movies would let me use all the resolution possible, as at the minute they seem to max out at 1080p. HDR is supported in Netflix though, and content looks great.
The other slight quirk about this display is the tall 21:9 aspect ratio. This is great for content shot at this size, movies for instance and lots of Netflix originals, yet it’s not so good for 16:9 or 18:9 stuff. You’ll want to stretch most videos out to avoid black bars either side of the screen. I have found most apps work fine, with games like Call of Duty mobile making extra use of the screen real-estate.
Resolution is only one thing and a good display requites plenty of other traits. Thankfully the Xperia 1 II impresses here too. The CineAlta ‘Creator Mode’ aims to give you a better representation of content, supporting 10-bit colour and the BT.2020 colour gamut. Brightness levels are good too, even when you’re using the phone in sunlight.

Performance

Snapdragon 865 chipset
That is paired with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage
Excellent audio performance

Like any worthy Android flagship in 2020, the Xperia 1 II has the Snapdragon 865 5G at its heart. That’s paired with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. Once again, Sony signals its target audience by deciding to give us more storage, rather than a little more RAM. That decision is fine by me and the 8GB feels more than adequate.
This is a fast phone, though the lack of the 90Hz display means it doesn’t feel quite as slick as the OnePlus 8 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S20. Still, it can handle anything you throw at it: from games at the full graphical setting to any app from Google Play.
Audio performance is excellent here too, once again showing just how good this is as a media machine. You’ve got a 3.5mm headphone port and stereo front-firing speakers that sound terrific with noticeable bass and loads of volume. Dolby Atmos is supported, as is Hi-Res audio and Bluetooth 5.1.
Sony’s software has often felt hamstrung in the past, focussing on needless extras and forcing the brand’s own apps throughout. That’s not so much the case anymore as the software here is very much Google’s own vision for Android. There are a few Sony extras of course, but most of these add to the experience rather than detract from it.
There are two distinct Sony apps: Cinema Pro and Photo Pro. Both of these bring features from the brand’s incredibly popular range of Alpha cameras to give you more control over video and photos respectively.
Camera

UI similar to Sony’s Alpha cameras
Three rear cameras
Lots of manual options

Those two dedicated camera apps give the Sony Xperia 1 II another unique advantage. Shooting with this phone feels more like taking snaps and capturing video with an actual camera than any other phone on the best camera phones list. If you’re familiar with the Alpha cameras and in particular its UI then you’ll feel right at home here. These apps give you greater control; bringing manual options to the forefront and easier to get at.

If you use these controls to their fullest you can capture some excellent snaps with the Xperia 1 II. But getting the best picture isn’t quite as easy as it is on some of the competition – you need to work a bit harder to get the most out of it.
There are three cameras on the back, all of which use a 12-megapixel sensor. You’ve got the main wide camera with a 24mm focal length and an f/1.7 lens along with larger 1.8um pixels – these make the sensor here 50% more sensitive than the Xperia 1.
Paired with that is an excellent f/2.4 70mm telephoto (for comparison, the tele on the iPhone 11 Pro is a mere 53mm) and an f/2.2 16mm ultra wide. It’s a versatile setup and one that forgoes high-megapixel counts. It also lacks any sort of periscope zoom, a feature often found on competing devices you’ll find at this price.
That’s not to say Sony has decided against adding any new tech here. Once again dipping into its Alpha arsenal with real-time eye AF tracking for both humans and animals. This does an eerily excellent job of focusing on the eye and it really does work. Sony says this can carry out 60 calculations per second to let you shoot 20 fps. This sort of thing would likely be unavailable if the sensors here packed similar amounts of megapixel to the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra.
You can capture some really great snaps from all three of the cameras. Colours are accurate, the post-processing feels a lot less aggressive and, of course, focussing is very snappy. Maybe I would like to see low light shots look a little less noisy, but if you’re willing to play around with the manual mode then that’s one of my few criticisms.
Video capture is impressive too – with the same caveats. You can shoot 4K HDR content at 21:9 and 60fps and there’s a load of really nice looking colour presets that add to that cinematic feel.
Battery life
The 4000mAh battery inside the Xperia 1 II is a little on the small side. It’s smaller than that in the Galaxy S20 after all and that doesn’t have all these pixels to push.
The regular 60Hz refresh rate does offset the drain somewhat and you can easily make it through the day. I don’t think this will be a multi-day phone for many heavy users, even if my usage has changed somewhat with the current lockdown.
Sony always seems to manage to get more juice out of a battery than you’d expect, so I would be really interested to see what an Xperia with a 5000mAh cell could achieve.
A full charge takes about 90 minutes and you can get to 50% in 30 if you’re using a suitable charger. Wireless charging is here and is always a welcome feature.
You should buy it if…
You want a flagship with a headphone jack
Very few high-specced flagship phones still ship with 3.5mm headphone jacks, meaning you’re restricted to wireless cans and making sure you’ve got a dingle handy. The Xperia 1 II has such a port and wide range of supported audio codecs.
You love watching content on a phone
This is a phone made for watching videos. There’s 4K support, HDR and the wide 21:9 panel is ideal for movies. 
You’re an Alpha camera user
Sony has brought much of the DNA from its Alpha camera series to the camera app here and if you’re a fan of those you’ll feel right at home. 
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You’re after a 120Hz panel
The only thing missing from the display here is a true 120Hz mode giving everything a smoother feel. This effect instead is being achieved through software trickery and the results are a bit mixed.

The Oppo Find X2 Pro is better than the Reno 10X Zoom in almost every way and after months of waiting it’s finally widely available to buy in the UK. Read on to find out why this is one of the best Android phones you can buy right now.
The Oppo 10X Zoom isn’t the Find X2 Pro’s competition, in any case. With its £1099 asking price, Oppo’s latest sits in between the Galaxy S20 Plus and the S20 Ultra.
While the Find X2 Pro does feature highlights, the others don’t – blisteringly fast 65W charging and a mammoth 512GB storage, for example; it also loses out on a feature Apple and Samsung flagships have included as standard for generations – wireless charging.
With Huawei facing tough times with its Mate 30 Pro and P40 Pro both lacking Google features many users depend on, Oppo has a golden opportunity right now to claw some market share from Huawei. Has it done enough with the Find X2 Pro?
Oppo Find X2 Pro Pricing – SIM free and carriers
We’ve had to wait a while, but the Oppo Find X2 Pro is now available in the UK. Support for the phone is good across networks and it has been joined by a couple of slightly cheaper options in the form of the X2 Lite and X2 Neo. Both EE and Vodafone have the phone available on their 5G networks and it is available through Carphone Warehouse too. Check our prices below for the best deals.


Oppo Find X2 Pro – Design
There are two Find X2 Pro designs. The first is the ceramic option, which looks just like glass, but with a slight curvy, striated patterning on the back. Then, there’s the vegan leather version, which is basically pleather.
Both look and feel luxurious, but the vegan leather version is the one with the wow factor, it got the most coos from friends in our week with the phone. It is a bit thicker, and has a muted dayglow orange back as well as rose gold trimmings – so won’t be for everyone. Meanwhile, the ceramic one is more of a fingerprint magnet, but it’s also the demure option sp might suit more professional buyers. Ports and buttons are identical across both.
Like its main competition, there’s no headphone jack, though we got a USB-C adapter in the box, and the Find X2 Pro features two speakers. 
Clocking in at 207g for the ceramic version, 200g for the vegan leather version, the Pro is heavier than the S20 Plus and iPhone 11 Pro, and it’s thicker as well. That said, it has a softer curve around its back and a more pronounced curve on the front than Samsung’s flagship, so despite its additional on-paper heft, it feels streamlined and comparable in hand. 
The Pro also has the tallest screen of the bunch too, which is a double-edged sword. It’s a bit more of a stretch to reach the top, especially one-handed, but it’s also better suited to split-screen multitasking and 21:9 video.  
We trialled two versions of the phone, across two software iterations. While we had a couple of issues with palm rejection on the first, owing to that oh so curved display, this seemed to be fixed in version two. Additionally, whack a case on the phone (there’s one included in the box), and you shouldn’t have any issues with accidental touches. 
Also worth noting, the Oppo Find X2 Pro is IP68 water and dust resistant, whereas the vanilla Find X2 isn’t. 

Oppo Find X2 Pro screen – Bright, sharp, smooth and punchy
The Find X2 Pro’s design is excellent, sure, but its chassis is more notably a vehicle for two things – that screen and that camera. Starting with the screen, and it’s an absolute beauty in every sense of the word.
At a Galaxy S20 Plus matching 6.7-inches, it’s a big one, though, it’s a bit taller and a smidgen narrower in the flesh. 
The essential tenets of smartphone screen excellence are adhered to here: bright, sharp, smooth, punchy, deep, and looks great from all angles. Starting with brightness, the Find X2 Pro has a max peak brightness of between 800 nits and 1,200 nits. That’s compared to the 600 nits of the Reno 10 X Zoom – a considerable step up. This extra backlight really helps with outdoor viewing, even in bright sunlight.  
As for resolution, it climbs up to WQHD+, which translates to 513 pixels-per-inch (PPI). Considering the iPhone 11 Pro’s screen has a 458PPI and is plenty sharp, the Find X2 Pro is a dream on the pixel-front, just like the S20 Plus. It’s smooth like the S20 Plus, too, with a 120Hz refresh rate that flows like a curling stone gliding across an ice rink. Coupled with a 240Hz touch refresh rate, like all the S20s, the Oppo Find X2 Pro can read taps and swipes faster than it can display them, making for an instantaneous feeling interface. 

The tech behind the screen is also standout, a Samsung-made AMOLED panel that’s loaded up with typical OLED traits – inky, deep blacks, zingy, vibrant colours, and decent viewing angles. Oppo offers up plenty of screen options too, from simple settings like dark mode, eye-care, through to more advanced features like ambient colour temperature sensing – pretty much the same as TrueTone on iPhones. 
There’s also scope to customise the perceived resolution and refresh rate of the screen in a bid to save battery power too; and then there’s Oppo’s proprietary secret upscaling sauce. 
A big name for something that could go unnoticed, Oppo’s 01 Ultra Vision Engine helps upscale content from 30fps to 60fps and also turns standard dynamic range video into video that takes advantage of the Find X2 Pro’s 10-bit HDR display. The feature is certified to work across Netflix and YouTube, the two services most will likely be streaming content on, and can be turned on or off in the settings. 
On the subject of credentials, the phone’s also DCI-P3 rated at 100%, showing off colours accurately, and even the glass on top is flagship-grade, with Gorilla Glass 6 keeping the Find X2 Pro’s screen feeling sleek and looking scratch-free. 
Oppo Find X2 Pro Performance – Powerful and spacious
A flagship phone needs flagship power, and the Oppo Find X2 Pro doesn’t disappoint with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset combined with 12GB RAM. The 865 is our preferred chip of 2020, along with Huawei’s Kirin 990, as found in the folding Mate Xs, as it seems to handle the heat that bit better than the Exynos chips found in global editions of the Samsung S20 phones.
The Snapdragon 865 also benchmarks incredibly well, with a Geekbench multi-core score of 3319, and a single-core score of 901. That’s about on-par with the Galaxy S20 Plus, falling behind the iPhone 11 Pro, but not by much. As for Antutu, it scores 596,354, making it the first phone we’ve tested to trump Apple’s new flagship, which ‘only’ reached 558,778 in the benchmark. 
Practically speaking, the Find X2 Pro didn’t slow down or stutter with us, and nothing gave it a reason to pause in real-world use, whether we were 4K filming or 3D gaming. 
Better yet, Oppo has loaded up a giant 512GB storage in the Find X2 Pro. That’s four times the capacity of the £999 Galaxy S20 Plus, and eight times that found in the £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro. This extra space makes it the best phone you can buy if you’re a file-hoarder, and a fan of massive, 1GB+ games. 

Oppo Find X2 Pro camera – An excellent snapper
To succeed in today’s crowded flagship world, Oppo needs a killer camera phone. The Reno 10 X Zoom was incredible given its periscope camera’s reach, but its primary camera’s picture quality was never mind-blowing. Now, however, Oppo’s flagship is battling with the big boys, and the once trademark over the top Oppo processing has been dialled way back.
While the S20 Plus is still a great camera phone, it isn’t best-in-class, and on paper, the Find X2 Pro beats both the S20 Plus and the iPhone 11 Pro when it comes to zoom. It also outguns them with its resolution, with the phone’s primary camera featuring Sony’s new 12-bit IMX689 sensor with a large 1/1.4” size and 1.12-micron pixels.
The 13MP periscope camera offers up a 10x hybrid zoom and a 60x digital zoom. Oppo doesn’t state the camera’s focal length, but we’re guessing it’s 5x that of the primary camera, based on the results we were getting from it. 
Next up, is a high-resolution 48MP ultra-wide camera, which features a tried and tested, Sony IMX586 sensor, and an f/2.32 lens. There’s no time of flight (ToF) sensor here, but the phone still captures portrait mode shots complete with background defocus effects that are accurate for the most part.
Generally speaking, the Oppo Find X2 Pro’s camera is excellent. It snaps pictures quickly; they look sharp provided your hand’s steady, and across lighting conditions, it impresses. This is true of all three cameras, and night mode works across them all – unlike on the Reno 10 X Zoom. 
The new Sony sensor is also a clarity whizz, with 100% of its pixels engaged for focusing, traditional camera phones only engage 3% of theirs’. Whether it’s this or Oppo’s imaging software, the result is a camera phone that reliably locks onto a target. The ultra-wide lens can also focus as close as 2.5cm for striking macro shots, bettering the S20-series, who’s widest angle lens is fixed focus. 
As for overall image quality, in good light, the 12MP images the phone captures look realistic and detailed, so there’s no need to override the default resolution and boost it to 48MP unless you’re shooting 12-bit RAW photos – a trick usually reserved for prosumer cameras. White balance isn’t as even across the Find X2 Pro’s three cameras as it is on the Galaxy S20 Plus or the iPhone 11 Pro, but standalone, each camera’s pictures are where they need to be. 
As the lights go down, auto night mode kicks in, and it does a solid job of pulling detail out of even the darkest shadows. The Find X2 Pro is slightly better than the Galaxy S20 Plus in the dark, competing directly with Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro, Huawei’s finest, and the Pixel 4’s Night Sight mode.
Video on the Find X2 Pro also looks stand out, especially when showcased on that glorious screen. With up to 4K capture, it grabs crisp clarity – and for now, we’re okay with no 8K recording, as found on the S20 Plus. 
The Ultra Steady mode boosts image stabilisation and drops the resolution to 1080p for silky, GoPro-like video, and the phone’s improved focusing is showcased in video beautifully. Nighttime video capture is hit and miss (more miss), but that can be said of all camera phones today.
The Find X2 Pro also has a high-resolution, 32MP selfie camera, and this is absolutely up to the task. That said, if you can, try and use the primary camera most of the time, do – it’s exceptional.

Oppo Find X2 Pro software – Much improved, but not perfect
Running Android 10 with full access to Google’s Play Store and other services, the Find X2-series shouldn’t leave you with any cause for concern when it comes to apps. Additionally, Oppo has revised its interface, Color OS. 
Color OS was once incredibly overbearing on the Reno 10 X Zoom, but on the Find X2 Pro, it’s much, much better. As you swipe through home screens and the apps tray, it’s clear that Oppo hasn’t loaded its new phone with anywhere near as much bloatware as it once did. There’s no Oppo Store for a confusing multi app-store experience, none of the random, third-party apps and just a smattering of handy Oppo highlights, like a voice recorder and note-taking tool. 
Gliding at 120Hz, there’s a lot to be said for simply swiping through the silky smooth UI. With plenty of customisation tools in the settings ranging from screen colour calibration, through to gesture navigation control, if you want to tinker and make it your own, you can.
We quite like the Smart Assistant screen to the left of the home screen – it’s similar to OnePlus’s ‘Shelf’, and serves as a home for a few app shortcuts and chunkable bits of info – weather, steps etc. That said, we’d have also liked the option to be able to switch it off, which we couldn’t find.

Oppo Find X2 Pro battery life – Plenty of juice
The Find X2 Pro doesn’t offer up wireless charging. That’s one of the most significant drawbacks of the device, which says a lot because, for many, it really won’t be that big a deal. What it does support, however, is 65W wired charging so that you can power it up in little more than 35 minutes, from 0-100%.
At 4260mAh, despite the X2 Pro packing a smaller battery capacity than the giant 5000mAh cell in the Galaxy S20 Ultra, we found it to perform better (than the Exynos version). Additionally, our S20 devices got a bit warm in our time with them. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon 865 powered Find X2 Pro stayed relatively cool, even when fast charging. 
We comfortably made it through a full day with the X2 Pro, with plenty of photography, video capture and browsing. It won’t extend to two days, but if you’re careful, you could still have enough by bedtime for the first part of your next day. 
Should you buy the Oppo Find X2 Pro?
Oppo has hit the target with its Find X2 Pro. The design, screen and camera are all stunning. While it might lack a couple of bells and whistles found in the best from Apple and Samsung, and it certainly isn’t cheap at £1,099; it’s a cracking smartphone.

The fact it is packing 512GB storage as standard charges incredibly quickly and lasts a whole day only cements its position as one of the best flagships of 2020.

Verdict




























 



The P40 Pro Plus is a beautiful, premium phone with the best smartphone camera system money can buy, but it’s far from perfect. No Google means daily software stumbling blocks, even with Huawei’s handy new Petal Search. This makes it tough to justify with such a high asking price in the Western market. Still, it’s 10x zoom camera smashes through the optical zoom ceiling with a 260mm focal length, that easily outclasses the S20 Ultra.



Pros

A fantastic, versatile camera system
Premium design and screen
Top-tier specs and storage



Cons

Very expensive
No Google support
Mono speaker

There’s only one camera on the smartphone scene that packs a true 10x optical zoom.
Featuring no less than five cameras around the back, it’s the best smartphone camera system money can buy, for a certain kind of user. But, with it costing £1299 and coming with ongoing software issues, it’s a hard sell for most mainstream Western buyers.
At first glance the Pro Plus is strikingly similar to the £899 Huawei P40 Pro. The Pro and Pro Plus share the same design, screen, chipset, battery capacity, software experience, and more.
This may justifiably lead you to ask: how can Huawei justify charging almost £1300 for the Pro Plus variant? The answer’s pretty simple. It’s added a world first on a smartphone (not counting the Samsung Galaxy Camera) – a 10x optical zoom to make this one of the best camera phones around. 
Editor’s note: If you’re interested in the rest of the range you can check out our Huawei P40 review and our Huawei P40 Pro review. 
Design – A Huawei P40 Pro doppelganger with a ceramic back 
From the front, the P40 Pro Plus is a P40 Pro. It’s screen size, resolution and technology are all identical to the vanilla Pro, as is the pill-shaped selfie camera cutout in the top left. 
At 6.58-inches, the Pro Plus’s screen sits between that of the Galaxy S20 and the S20 Plus, and iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. While it’s size is relatively manageable, it’s a heavy phone measuring in at 226g – the same weight as the beefiest iPhone. 
The phone’s screen itself isn’t too curved, so accidental presses aren’t an issue. Its ‘overflow’ design, with curved glass (not screen) on all four sides is a seriously lovely touch.
The curved glass spills over into the buffed metal frame, which peaks slightly at the phone’s corners. Huawei says this adds a degree of durability to the P40 Pro-series, with more metal on the corners than glass.

At 9mm thick, the P40 Pro Plus may make the 7.9mm thin Galaxy S20 5G feel like a waif, but it’s not much thicker than the S20 Ultra and iPhone 11 Pro Max.
Available in two ceramic colours, black or white, the P40 Pro Plus’s is almost as tough as sapphire glass. Huawei went to great lengths to explain how the ceramic powder is pressed and baked to form the high-gloss, durable finish, and the white version we reviewed looks great and seems robust. Better still, our white device looked totally fingerprint-free around the back, which is a novelty for glossy phones.
The P40 Pro Plus’s buttons are on the right, while all the other points of interest are at the base – a mono-speaker, SIM card tray, and a USB-C port. Around the back, there’s a statement camera bump, and at the top is an IR blaster.

Screen – We’ve been here before
Huawei’s P40 Pro Plus screen looks very good. With a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, it’s tall, and its 1200 x 2640 resolution means it sits between two industry standards – FullHD and QuadHD. Should you really care about any of that though? Not really. The main thing is, it’s bright, sharp and beautifully punchy.
Unlike the main competition from Samsung and OnePlus, the P40 Pro Plus doesn’t feature a 120Hz refresh rate display, instead, capping out at 90Hz. This puts Huawei in line with last year’s OnePlus phones, but still ahead of the iPhone 11 Pro.
The screen supports HDR10 content, packs OLED technology and has a 441-pixel density – sharper than the P40 or P30 Pro,  but lower-res’ than the OnePlus 8 Pro and Galaxy S20-series.
Viewing angles on the P40 Pro Plus are excellent, bright, and the phone’s easy to see indoors and out. We would have loved a smaller punch hole in the top left, but that really is our only gripe with this phone’s display.
Performance – Ample power and plenty of storage for the Huawei P40 Pro Plus
The P40 Pro and Pro Plus pack plenty of similarities on the inside too. For starters both are powered by the same Kirin 990 processor, which enables some of the fastest 5G speeds around. The 8GB RAM, on paper, means neither phone can stack up to other 12GB RAM top-enders like the OnePlus 8 Pro, however, day-to-day, you won’t see any slowdown. 
Benchmarks aren’t class-leading, with Antutu scores climbing up to 524,527 when in performance mode, and around 480,000 when in standard mode. Class-leading they may not be, but they’re still top-tier, beating out gaming phones like the ROG Phone 2 and BlackShark 2.

Camera – The Huawei P40 Pro Plus camera is the most complete smartphone system money can buy
The Huawei P40 Pro Plus’s primary camera is identical to that of the P40 Pro, and that’s no bad thing. The shared 50MP Ultra Vision sensor is huge and captures stellar pictures.
An f/1.9 aperture lens with a 23mm focal length pairs with large, 2.44-micron combined-pixels when taking 12MP images – that’s class-leading for a phone. Bigger pixels usually mean better photos, and in the Huawei P40 Pro-series’s case, the theory holds up.

Dynamic range is excellent for the most part, though shadow boosting can be a little overzealous. Saturation and sharpening are relatively tapered compared to the processing used on older Huawei phones. They’re also noticibly scaled right back when compared to snaps from the Galaxy S20-series. It leans towards warm tones, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Additionally, whatever the lighting, the P40 Pro Plus’s camera gets excellent results in automatic mode.
There’s also a mighty 40MP ultra-wide camera with an f/1.8 aperture and an 18mm angle of view. As with the Mate 30 Pro, this doubles up as the main video camera, so it can grab super-steady footage with no cropping. Additionally, it packs autofocus, locking in on close-up objects for some high-impact macro shots. 
With plenty of resolution and an expansive field of view, that 18mm focal length gets plenty of detail in the frame, making the P40 Pro Plus’s ultra-wide one of the best performers around. 
The P40 Pro Plus features not one, but two telephoto cameras. The first is an 8MP 3x zoom camera, sporting an f/2.4 lens, which is similar to that found on the Mate 30 Pro. The second is an 8MP 10x zoom camera with an f/4.4 lens. Both feature OIS, like the main camera. In general, they perform well provided the light is right.
Having both telephoto cameras means anywhere between 18-260mm equivalent focal lengths, you can be guaranteed a decent shot. The 10x zoom camera really does come into its own in great light. The P40 Pro Plus gets you closer than any other phone to objects, especially if you’re not averse to propping it up on a surface or using a mobile tripod. When the lights drop, though, its narrower aperture means handheld shots don’t look great. Fire up night mode, and using Huawei’s smart computational photography, all four cameras can see in the dark. 
Is the P40 pro Plus’s zoom in a different league to the S20 Ultra? We would say yes. Comparing shots taken on the two side-by-side, images from the Pro Plus impressed us more.
The selfie camera’s 32MP resolution is ample, and the primary sensor is paired with a secondary depth camera for secure face unlocking and depth effects. It also packs autofocus and shoots up to 4K front-firing video, which looks great. 
The P40 Pro’s video capture looks good across all resolutions, climbing up to 4K, 60fp. Footage captured on the main camera is stellar in medium to good lighting, well stabilised, and any fans of more natural levels of saturation and punch would prefer Huawei’s video style to that of Samsung.
See below for some photo samples:

Zoom at 10x
Software – EMUI 10.1 is great, but there’s still a Google shaped hole here
The Huawei P40 Pro Plus runs Android 10, with the brand’s own Emotion UI interface over the top. It isn’t on the same footing as other Android phones though, thanks to the US imposed Huawei Google ban. In short, this means no Play Store, and other limitations when using third-party apps.
The situation is improving, with Huawei’s inclusion of its app-finder – Petal Search – Find Apps, now installed as standard. This makes finding apps missing from the App Gallery easier.
This means for the most part getting the apps isn’t a huge problem, but what happens next is. Some apps outside Huawei’s store don’t work correctly on the new P40 handsets. Naturally, no Google apps run to full effect on the P40 Pro Plus. This includes Docs, Drive, Gmail, the Play Store and YouTube. Additionally, Google Meet and Calendar don’t work either, so if your business is set up as a G Suite organisation, then a new Huawei phone won’t make any sense. The limitation also extends to the Wear OS app, so if you’ve got your sights set on a Google-powered smartwatch, you’ll want a different phone. 
This incompatibility is improving in some areas, with apps like Netflix now working and Uber’s web app living in the Huawei AppGallery. However, we’re also finding some apps which once worked, like Disney+, now don’t – and don’t even get us started on games. The Google Play Store clearly has a monopoly on most triple-A titles, and developers just haven’t ported many over for Huawei phones.
For anyone less beholden to Google or gaming, the P40 Pro Plus’s software is excellent. Huawei has supplemented Android 10 with some great multitasking features – everything is slick, smooth, and stable. That said, you really do need to know what you’re getting into before picking one up if you want to avoid nasty surprises down the line.

Battery Life – Long-lasting and fast charging, wired or wireless
The Pro Plus’s 4200mAh battery lasts a full day without any trouble, and delivers excellent screen-on time. Over 90 minutes of video played back at full brightness dropped the battery by only 8%.
Fast wired and wireless charging at 40W means the P40 Pro Plus powers up fully in under an hour, and thanks to fast reverse wireless charging, it will even power up friends phones or accessories. 
Should I buy the Huawei P40 Pro Plus?
We doubt Huawei expects to sell too many of the P40 Pro Plus given the phone’s high price. While the Plus is better than the P40 Pro, it isn’t £400 better unless you’re someone who needs the very best when it comes to imaging. Add to the mix all the Google issues Huawei phones face today, and we reckon most Huawei fans will pick up the vanilla P40 Pro – a stellar value camera phone in its own right. 
Meanwhile, anyone who needs Google and has over a grand to drop on a new smartphone will opt for the iPhone 11 Pro, Oppo Find X2 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, even with their inferior camera systems.
What Huawei hasn’t created with the P40 Pro Plus is a must-have smartphone for the masses and it just missed out on our best phone and best Android phone list. However, what Huawei has created is world-first camera tech, proving Huawei is still a leader when it comes to pushing smartphone imaging further than the competition.

Verdict





























 



From a build and functionality perspective, the Magic Keyboard is great. It offers the best iPad typing experience, packs in handy extras like backlighting and passthrough charging and introduces a trackpad.

It does all come down to the price, though. This is a real investment and as such, the shortcoming are a little more apparent. The lack of a function row of keys is my biggest qualm, and it's something that should be added in the next version.



Pros

Great typing experience
Seemless integration with the iPad Pro
Magnet hold everything in place very securely
Trackpad support is (mostly) well done



Cons

It's very expensive for a keyboard
Really needs a function row
No doubting it's heavy






Key Specifications

Review Price: £299
Magic Keyboard
USB-C port
Trackpad
Backlight



Alongside the iPad Pro 2020, Apple announced its most lavish accessory yet. The Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro is a floating keyboard for its latest tablet that happens to cost £300.
Apple has been selling a keyboard attachment for its iPad line for a few years in the form of the Smart Keyboard Folio, however this new Magic Keyboard is different in various ways – and not just the higher price.

iPad Pro 2020 review: The best yet?

It packs proper keys that are backlit, a trackpad and a USB-C port for charging. With that being said, can an accessory ever be worth such a high price?
Design – Thicker, and heavier, than a MacBook Air?
While the Smart Keyboard Folio felt like a keyboard was tacked onto a typical iPad case, this is purely a keyboard. Yes, it offers protection on both front and back but you can’t flip the keys around.
Thankfully, due to the way it has been designed, it’s very easy to pop the iPad off the keyboard when you want to use it separately. The iPad attaches via lots of strong magnets and it’s really firm and rigid – you can even hold the setup by just the keyboard and the iPad will stay in place.
Once the iPad is in place it sort of floats just above the keyboard, popping the screen at a comfortable height for typing. You can tilt it slightly downwards, but only a small amount and I  have found the default position it jumps to is the best. If a second version was to be made, then a slightly customisable position would be appreciated.
iPad Pro open
….and closed
The whole setup is made from a soft plastic that seems, so far anyway, easy to clean and resistant to dings and scratches. 
Keyboard and trackpad – The best iPad typing experience
It’s the quality of the keys that really make the Magic Keyboard such a great addition to the iPad. They mirror those found on the most recent MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, with scissor switches and a decent amount of travel. Typing here is far more comfortable than on my 2016 MacBook Pro with its thankfully retired butterfly switches.
With the 12.9-inch version, the keys are well-spaced and large enough to type quickly without making too many mistakes. They’re backlit too, making nighttime typing a lot easier. The backlight comes on automatically when the lights dim, however you’ll have to bury deep into settings for any sort of customisation for the lighting.
My one criticism with the keyboard, and something I hope is addressed in a second edition, is the lack of a function row. There’s no way to alter the volume without reaching for the physical rocker on the top or easily skipping songs. I have often found myself reaching up expecting a brightness key to be there, only to be met by nothing.

Below the keyboard is a rectangular trackpad. It’s not as large as you’d find on a MacBook, but it properly clicks in when pressed and is very responsive. Trackpad/mouse support was added in the latest update to iPadOS and for the most part it works well. Check out the software section of our iPad Pro 2020 review for a deeper look at this cursor support.
Another benefit of the trackpad is gestures and a lot of these will be familiar to Mac users. A three-finger swipe sideways, for instance, lets you flip through apps while the same swipe upwards takes you into the multitasking menu.
Charging and power passthrough – A handy addition
You don’t need to charge the Smart Keyboard separately as it draws power directly from the iPad Pro thanks to the Smart Connector on either the 2018 iPad Pro or 2020 iPad Pro. There’s no setup either – just attach and start typing.
Another nice addition is the USB-C port, which lets you charge the iPad Pro and keep the other USB-C port free for, say, plugging in an external HDD. It is worth noting that you can’t plug these into the secondary port – that’s for charging only – and it’ll charge slightly slower. If you want full speed charging your best bet if the port on the tablet itself, however it wasn’t that much slower.

These are the best tablets you can buy

It does all come down to the price, though. This is a real investment and as such, the shortcoming are a little more apparent. The lack of a function row of keys is my biggest qualm, even if it’s something I assume I will eventually get used to.

Verdict


































The Motorola Edge is a great phone, especially at the price. It feels like a true flagship and doesn’t really sacrifice much to reach the lower price. It’s fast, has a good camera, 5G and it’s one of the best looking phones around.



Pros
5G without spending too muchExcellent softwareReally nice screenA lot of phone for the money

Cons
No IP ratingOverly curved display is a bit annoyingSome bugs in the software

Key Features
Review Price: £5496.7-inch HDR10, FHD+ curved displaySnapdragon 765G. 6GB RAMAndroid 1064MP main camera4500mAh battery


With its eye-catching design, 5G connectivity and mid-range price-tag, the Motorola Edge is an interesting prospect that proves the brand shouldn’t limit itself to making budget phones.
For years now Motorola has been bringing us excellent phones that cost south of £250. Now, with the Motorola Edge, it’s trying to offer a more high-end experience. The Edge is also joined by the Motorola Edge Plus, a phone it hopes will take on the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and Oppo Find X2.
The Edge, on paper at least. looks impressive. But in aiming to hit a price-point that means it can’t include every feature going, does it end up feeling shortchanged? Or could this be our new best mid-range phone? Read on for our full review.
Design and screen – Is the Moto Edge’s curved screen more annoying than interesting?
I’m normally very dismissive of phones that go all-in on overly curved displays and considering quite how much of a steep curve the Motorola Edge has I was ready to hate it. But to my own surprise I found that I don’t completely despise the Edge’s. It’s not as ergonomic as a flat screen, but when it’s combined with the very narrow body it does work.
This is a long phone – it’s taller than the iPhone 11 Pro Max and a similar size to the Xperia 1 – but it’s a lot narrower than Apple’s flagship. It can still be comfortably held in one hand as a result.
But, many of the common issues with curved screens remain despite this. For example, accidental presses on the screen are all too common. Even when simply resting my palm on the sides webpages can unintentionally start scrolling up and down. The edges also catch the light a whole lot more than the front of the display, causing a lot of distracting reflections when you’re watching video in anything but a dark room.

It’s a 90HZ screen
Motorola has added some software tweaks that aim to make use of the display edge. There’s a pop-up panel that gives you quick access to apps, while notifications can send colourful lights around the area where the display droops. You can also, if you want, force apps to ignore the sides completely and stick to just the front. This only works for a few certain apps and it doesn’t work on the homescreen meaning it’s not overly useful, but I did found the feature handy for apps that are focussed on reading.
The rest of the 6.7-inch display is actually very nice, not always a given for a phone that costs £549. You’ve got a bright OLED panel, with HDR 10 support. There’s also a front camera buried inside a small circular cutout. It might only be a 1080p display, but detail remains sharp and unless you’ve got a QHD+ phone to hand to compare I doubt you’ll really notice the difference. The best thing about the display though is the 90Hz refresh rate, which gives everything from scrolling to gaming a smooth finish. There is an option of an ‘Auto’ mode, which supposedly switches between 60 and 90Hz but I found this caused some odd drops when scrolling and I turned it off. I had issues with the optical fingerprint sensor not always recognising my thumb – although this is the case with just about all these still fairly terrible in-display fingerprint scanners.
Overall the Edge is a good looking phone, even if, screen aside, there’s little to really get excited about. The back is finished in a smudgy glass, while the top and bottom are flat. You’ll find the welcome addition of a headphone jack on the bottom, however there’s a distinct lack of any official IP rating. That’s far from a given at this price but it still would have been nice to have and it would have helped the Edge one-up the similarly-priced OnePlus 8.

Performance – The Edge offers 5G for the masses
One of the biggest differences between this Edge and Edge Plus is the chipset used. Instead of the flagship Snapdragon 865, the Edge uses the Snapdragon 765G – Qualcomm’s current mid-range silicone.
Some might see this as a negative, but for me it makes the Edge more of an interesting proposition. This is one of the cheapest 5G phones you’ll find, but it still packs enough bite to keep things running smoothly in most situations.
It’s hard to notice any day-to-day tasks that feel slower than on a Snapdragon 865 device. Jumping between messaging and social apps, refreshing Instagram and opening up the camera are all done with ease and without any lag.
You’ll notice the difference a little more in certain games, especially if you’ve used an 865-powered phone before. Here games take a fraction longer to load than they do on handsets with the more premium chip. There is a difference, especially in titles that require of lot of horsepower, on what settings you can safely use, but it’s not enough to dismiss the Moto Edge as slow.
My review unit also packed 6GB RAM (though some markets might have a 4GB option) and 128GB onboard storage. You’ll find an expandable storage slot on the top, which can also handle a second SIM if you’d prefer.
Data speeds are also great, thanks to support for 5G networks in the UK and further afield. Unlike the US Moto Edge Plus, the regular Edge lacks the mmWave 5G support. Being stuck in lockdown has hampered my ability to test the 5G here in the real world – support for this still fairly new tech remains limited – but having it on a £500 device is impressive and futureproofs it for years to come. Of course if 5G isn’t supported in your area the phone will drop back down to 4G, 3G etc.

Camera – The Moto Edge doesn’t quite stand out for its snaps
Camera hardware is a bigger differentiation between the Edge and Edge Plus. The Edge Plus’ more premium 108-megapixel main sensor has been ditched and the complimentary cameras downgraded, on paper at least, to help keep costs down.
The Motorola Edge still keeps plenty of camera tricks. There are three main cameras, plus a time of flight (ToF) sensor for extra bokeh skills, along with a 25-megapixel unit around the front.
What I have noticed the most about the using the Moto Edge, rather than a phone around the £1000 mark, is that while the main sensor takes very good snaps it’s the surrounding cameras that don’t stand out so well. The ultrawide and telephoto are both fine for adding a little variety to your shots and little else. In general they produce slightly blurry shots that are rarely much use.
Switch to the main 64-megapixel camera and the results are far superior. With something like the iPhone 11 Pro (obviously a far pricier phone) I would say I use all the cameras equally – here my shooting is restricted mostly to this main sensor.
While it might be capable of shooting pure 64-megapixel snaps, most of the time you’ll be taking 16-megapixel images. Daylight shots are good. Results are colourful and have decent dynamic range. The HDR effect also helps counter bright sunshine. As you’re essentially combining four pixels into one you’ll also get large amount of details, particularly noticeable in the bark of trees or on leaves. These images pop on social media.
As seems to be the case with most phones around this price that aren’t the Pixel 3a things fall apart a bit when the light isn’t very good. The Moto Edge has a dedicated night mode – Night Vision – that tries to enhance brightness when you’re shooting in dim conditions. It does an ok job though this isn’t the phone for you if you’re big into low-light shooting.
Video maxes out at 4K 30fps and wasn’t too impressive, same goes for the selfie camera.
Software – The Moto tweaks are welcome
Motorola has done a great job with the software on the Edge. It’s taken very much a ‘less is more’ approach, combining the majority of its added tweaks into one handy app and then keeping everything else very ‘Google’. There’s no heavy skin or duplicate apps taking up space.
This ‘Moto’ app is home to everything from layout customisations to gesture control. You can switch fonts, themes, change your wallpaper or even the animation that follows a press on the fingerprint sensor here.
Moto Actions have been great for years and they’ve remained standout features on the brand’s cheaper phones. A quick twist of your wrist, for instance, opens the camera, while picking up the phone when it’s ringing will silence the tone.

Another Moto stalwart is Moto Display and again you’ll find the options for this in the Moto app. Moto Display makes it easy to see notifications, even when the screen is off, and enables you to interact with them without unlocking the phone. It’s a small tweak, but one that quickly becomes very useful.
While the device is running Android 10, Moto reps said they’ll be one update for the Edge. Though this is, and hopefully will, be subject to change. Phones at this price point need to be supported for a lot longer.
Battery Life – Another winning feature of the Moto Edge
The Moto Edge offers users excellent battery life. The large 4500mAh cell combined with a power-efficient chipset ensures the Edge can comfortably make it through a busy day without needing a charge. 
Throughout the review period, it regularly lasted around two days without charging, reaching around six hours of screen-on time. That’s with the 90Hz mode on and a 5G SIM installed – though usually just pulling 4G and Wi-Fi data.
I was less impressed with the charging speeds, even though Motorola brands it as ‘Turbo Power’. This seems to output 18w of power – the same as an iPhone 11 Pro – but with the big battery, it can take a while to fully juice up. There’s no wireless charging.

Verdict




























 



The Motorola G8 Power Lite retains a massive battery, but jettisons specs in other key areas, with the screen, camera, and display included. It's not a bad phone, but it doesn't hit that same value-for-money spot as its slightly pricier sibling.



Pros

Large battery
Smart design
Cheap



Cons

Mediocre screen
Sub-par performance
Micro-USB port, not USB-C






Key Specifications

Review Price: £149.99



The G8 Power Lite is a cheaper version of the Motorola G8 Power, which offers the same massive battery but lowers some other f the other specifications as well as the price for a more affordable overall purchase.
So with that in mind, is it more prudent to go for this device rather than the G8 Power? Do you get all the benefits for a cheaper price? Or are there a few too many compromises? Read our review to find out.
Motorola G8 Power Lite Design
The G8 Power Lite features a blend of colours on the back panel that give it a subtle yet attractive look – in this regard it actually outshines some of the more expensive models in the series.
On our review sample, the bright blue at the bottom soon melds into a darker purplish tint. There’s a speaker visible at the bottom of the phone, while nearer the top you’ll find the triple camera module plus the fingerprint sensor. The matte texture of the rear also makes the device less likely to pick up fingerprints or unsightly smears compared to its glossy rivals.

There’s a fairly subtle teardrop notch at the top of the screen to house the selfie camera, and bezels run round the edge of the display, along with a relatively significant chin at the bottom.
In more functional terms, it offers a 3.5mm headphone jack and a Micro SD slot – but the port is Micro-USB rather than USB-C, which feels like a real anachronism these days.
Overall, the design looks good and is functional – but we’d have strongly preferred a USB-C cable for greater compatibility and interchangeability with other devices.
Motorola G8 Power Lite Screen
The screen measures 6.5-inches and has a resolution of 720 x 1600. It’s a good size, and colours generally look bright and appealing.
Motorola G8 Power Lite Screen
However, the resolution is a little low, so you’ll notice that edges of shapes and letters aren’t completely clear-cut. This detracts from an immersive experience, but it’s still good enough to use for basic needs such as communication. But if you want to watch a lot of videos or even enjoy reading articles on your phone, you might want a slightly crisper display.
Motorola G8 Power Lite Performance
The Motorola G8 Power Lite runs on a MediaTek Helio P35 chipset, which is a significant downgrade from the Motorola G8 Power’s Snapdragon 665. You can see that clearly just by glancing at the benchmark scores recorded below:










Geekbench 5 Single Core
Geekbench 5 Multi Core
3D Mark Slingshot Extreme


Motorola G8
311
1321
1098


Motorola G8 Power
312
1361
1110


Motorola G8 Power Lite
175
920
479



But what does that mean in terms of real-world performance?
Scrolling through apps can be a little juddery, but I didn’t find that apps would shutdown on me, and limited multi-tasking didn’t present any major problems either. But games had to be played on low graphics settings, so if you’re a keen gamer you might want to shell out a bit more a more capable handset.
Motorola G8 Power Lite Battery life
The battery is a key selling point of this phone. A capacity of 5000mAh wouldn’t necessarily be expected in a top-flight flagship phone, let alone a cut-price budget model like this, so it’s exceptional to see that specification.
In terms of real world usage, I found that the battery dropped down to 95% from full after one hour of video streaming, and after three hours it had dropped down to 81%. That’s a good record, but given the massive battery combined with the undemanding display, I might have expected an even better performance; bear in mind that the G8 Power was down to 97% after an hour of video streaming.
When it comes to recharging this phone lags behind the snappier modern phones, taking approximately two hours to charge up from 20% to full battery. That’s exactly the same as we recorded with the G8 Power, but it’s almost half as slow as the standard Motorola G8.
Overall the battery is still a positive point for this phone, without a doubt; but it doesn’t deliver the same performance as the standard G8 Power, despite the same number on the specs sheet, and it does take a while to charge back up again.
Motorola G8 Power Lite Camera
The G8 Power Lite has a triple camera, which certainly sounds impressive, but in reality there’s not as much versatility as you might have hoped for. The set-up is led by a 16-megapixel wide camera, but it’s complemented by a 2-megapixel macro camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, rather than more handy options such as an ultrawide or telephoto lens. Nonetheless, it’s still an interesting package for a budget phone.
Motorola G8 Power Lite: Main Camera
The main camera is serviceable but not great. The detail is never stunning and sometime there are issues with finding the right balance between light and shade, but the images are at least fairly clear.
Motorola G8 Power Lite: Main Camera
But when you’re taking snaps in the evening, the camera’s flaws are only accentuated. In low-light scenarios, images look very blurry and highlights are blown out – a huge amount of detail is lost, to the extent that these images are practically unusable.
Motorola G8 Power Lite: Macro Camera
The macro camera, designed for shooting extreme close-ups, isn’t exactly bad, but neither does it do enough justify its existence on top of the existing cameras. It’s a rare moment when I find the need to use a dedicated macro camera over the standard wide angle shooter, and the performance of this snapper doesn’t do much to change my mind.
Motorola G8 Power Lite: Portrait Mode
On a more positive note, I was relatively impressed with portrait mode on the G8 Power Lite; the practical effect neatly cuts around the subject for the eye-popping bokeh effect.
Overall, the camera is serviceable in daylight conditions without being brilliant. But if you want to just snap quick pictures to remember something later then it will suffice; it’s nice to have a decent portrait mode thrown into the mix, but the macro camera doesn’t do much of value.
Should I buy the Motorola G8 Power Lite?
The Motorola G8 Power Lite is in a tough place with many best cheap phones around, If you have £150 as your maximum limit, then it’s not necessarily a bad choice – but if you fork out a little for cash for a Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 or a Motorola G8 Power, then you’re likely to have a better all-round experience from your phone.
This is a fairly basic phone, that’s likely to meet your expectations for the price. The battery is large, though not as enduring as we’d expected, and there’s nothing else that it particularly excels with – so think carefully as to whether it’s worth splashing out just a little for cash for a phone with superior cameras, performance, and screen that gives so much more enjoyment to your day-to-day tech usage.
But if you use your phone for fairly basic activities and you’d like a reliable battery, then this should do the job.

Verdict





























 



The LG V60 ThinQ has not got an official UK release, so getting hold of one is a little tricky. Still, if one is available in your region, then it can prove cheaper than the Galaxy S20 Ultra, especially in the States where the price is $950.

For that, you get a good phone with a fun Dual Screen add-on, 5G, performance that mostly matches the competition and a strong camera.

It does feel like LG needs a bit of reset with its flagship phones though and we might just get that with the LG Velvet. 



Pros

Great battery life
A screen that isn’t curved
Reliable cameras
A headphone jack
Some clever Dual Screen uses



Cons

The screen just can’t compete with other Android flagships
Still not convinced by the Dual Screen
Not the most ergonomic
LG's software needs a reboot

Review Price: £TBC
Dual screen add-on
Snapdragon 865 and 5G support
5000mAh battery
64MP main camera


The LG V60 ThinQ might not be as flashy as some of the other best phones around, but this is a surprisingly impressive phone – if you look past a few details that feel stuck in the past.
LG’s flagship phones have felt a bit stuck for years, which is why the recent announcement of the new LG Velvet line felt like the reboot they needed.
The LG V60 ThinQ is the perfect example: it manages to do a lot very, very well; however, there are some odd omissions and some areas (software especially) that need a thorough rethink.
Design – The LG V60 ThinQ is a big phone
If you’re keen to upgrade to a phone that isn’t huge, then I think it needs to be made clear immediately the LG V60 ThinQ isn’t for you. This is a brute of a device that feels bigger than the Galaxy S20 Ultra due to its lack of curves and far more squared-off design. It’s also not as modern as the latest Galaxy series, with thicker bezels around the display and a teardrop notch that lacks a high-end finish.
It’s a lot more industrial than most of the overly curvy 2020 flagships though, and that’s not really a bad thing. Once you get used to the size, it’s quite a nice phone to look at. My review unit has a pearly blue back with a soft gold rim that offers a nice contrast. It feels durable enough to handle a few drops before picking up too much damage.
Along the side of the phone, you’ve got quite a lot of buttons, with a dedicated Google Assistant key sitting alongside a split volume rocker and power button. It seems a waste to have a whole button just for opening the assistant – couldn’t think this just have been achieved with a long-press of the power key?

On the top, you’ve got the 5G capable SIM slot which also houses the expandable storage, and on the bottom, there is both a USB-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Yep, this is one of the few high-end phones that still have the port for plugging a pair of wired headphones. 
Screen and Dual Screen – This is what sets the LG V60 apart
Picking the most intriguing feature of the LG V60 ThinQ is easy: the Dual Screen addition. This included accessory functions just like it did on the LG V50 and LG G8X, adding a second panel to the device to create a sort of DIY Surface Duo. While the extra screen is the main benefit, the Dual Screen add-on also adds some extra protection to the phone’s display and a handy screen on the front for checking time and notifications.
Attaching the Dual Screen is easy as the phone just slides in and clips into the USB-C port. While the headphone jack remains visible, the case covers up the outer USB-C port and replaces it with a magnetic connector. To counter this, LG has included a magnetic dongle that clips onto the bottom and allows you to then connect a USB-C cable to charge the phone.

The Dual Screen is certainly an interesting addition to the phone. It adds a bunch of clever, and surprisingly fun, features from turning it into a gamepad for supported games like Asphalt 9 to just giving you more screen real-estate for multitasking. For instance, you can have YouTube open on one screen and Chrome on the other.
LG had decided to keep the two screens very much the same, which is good when using them together but limits the panel on the phone. Both are good, flat 6.8-inch OLED panels, with FHD+ resolutions and great colour reproduction. However, the resolution isn’t as crisp as much of the high-end Android competition, and the lack of a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate is certainly noticeable if you’ve had any time with the Samsung Galaxy S20 or OnePlus 8.

LG has even gone as far as mirroring the notch on the secondary panel – even though it doesn’t house a secondary front camera. This seems odd, but it allows for the two panels to mirror each other exactly, which actually makes more sense in use.
The one trick you’ll only find on the main display is the in-display fingerprint scanner. Like other optical fingerprint sensors, the one here is good, if not as good as a physical sensor. It can be temperamental, at times not unlocking for a run and then working instantly at others.
While I like the Dual Screen and it does add a much-needed unique flair to the V60, it’s not something I can keep on all the time. It’s too thick and adds more weight to an already weighty phone. It’s a halfway house to the foldable future that really needs to be built into the phone for it to properly work.
Camera – The LG V60 can compete with the best, if not beat them
Like much of this phone, the LG V60’s camera setup is good – if not exactly class-leading or unique. On the back, you’ve got a main 64-megapixel sensor with an f/1.9 lens that shoots, by default, 16-megapixel snaps alongside a 13-megapixel f/1.9 ultra-wide camera. There’s also a 10-megapixel camera on the front for selfies. 

Only having two main cameras means the V60 ThinQ isn’t quite as versatile as some of the competition and the fairly basic zooming capabilities are nothing to shout about.
Yet, the pictures the phone captures are actually really nice. It feels like LG has decided to go against the trend and not go too deep with post-processing and heavy HDR effects. Shots are naturally coloured, with subtle saturation and good dynamic range. This leaves you with pictures that are ready to be edited or tweaked as you see fit. Low-light shots follow a similar pattern and even though there is more noise and less detail than similar shots taken with the Galaxy S20, the results are still good.
What I really like about LG’s camera app is the manual mode, which is both easy to use and packs the ability to shoot some impressive macro shots with manual focus. 
In terms of video, the V60 ThinQ continues to perform well and packs a four mic array and the ability to capture 8K footage in HDR 10.
Performance and software – Great performance, disappointing software
Inside the LG V60 ThinQ, you’ll find the guts of your typical Android flagship: Snapdragon 865 with 5G modem, 8GB RAM and up to 256GB of internal storage. As you’d expect from those specs, this is a fast phone that can handle any game or app with ease and doesn’t get bogged down – even if you’re using both screens with separate apps on both.
For those that want benchmarks scores, the V60 scores around the same as the OnePlus 8 Pro and both phones feel very similar in terms of performance. Opening up Asphalt 9, for example, took the same amount on both phones.
Audio performance is impressive too, with both the 3.5mm port and onboard speakers pumping out some great sound. I don’t really mind when a phone has lost the headphone port, but I still always enjoy having it back when it’s there.

What’s less impressive is the software layer, LG keeps putting over the top of Android. Here, Android 10 is covered by a gaudy skin with loads of duplicate apps and a generally old-fashioned feel. Samsung switched things up massively with its One UI and I feel LG needs to do something similar.
Battery life – Where the LG V60 ThinQ shines
It is when you use the LG V60 ThinQ over an extended period that you start to forgive the lack of real top-drawer specs. The 5000mAh paired with 1080p resolution display leaves you with some of the best battery life on any high-end Android phone.
With the Dual Screen attached and used consistently, the V60 ThinQ made it through a full day of use. Take the attachment off, and you’ll, predictably, see even better results. I managed to get through two days of use with near 7 hours of screen on time before feeling the need to reach for the charger. That’s impressive stuff.
When it does reach 0%, there’s support for Quick Charge 4+ and PD 2,0 along with wireless charging. Admittedly it’s far from the fastest phone to charge out there and is comfortably beaten by rivals like Oppo with the Find X2. A full wired charge took just less than two hours.
Should you buy the LG V60 ThinQ?
The LG V60 ThinQ has not got an official UK release, so getting hold of one is a little tricky. Still, if one is available in your region, then it can prove cheaper than the Galaxy S20 Ultra and a number of other best Android phones, especially in the States where the price is $950.
For that, you get a good phone with a fun Dual Screen add-on, 5G, performance that mostly matches the competition and a strong camera.
It does feel like LG needs a bit of reset with its flagship phones though and we might just get that with the LG Velvet.

Verdict





























 



The Black Shark 3 doesn’t revolutionise the gaming phone market. But it ticks all the right boxes that the limited number of Western gaming phone users look at. It comes with a decent high refresh rate screen, powerhouse parts and a distinct gamer-focused design. The only downside is some of the features will likely put off more casual gamers and regular phone buyers.



Pros

Flagship specs and performance
Wealth of great features for gamers
Excellent screen
Competitive price 



Cons

Design will put non-gamers off
Software additions aren't uniformly positive






Key Specifications

Review Price: £649
5G connectivity
8 / 12 GB RAM
128 / 256GB storage
Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 CPU
6.67-inch FHD+, 90Hz, AMOLED screen 
Triple sensor rear camera: 13MP ultra-wide, 5MP bokeh, 64MP clear lenses



The Black Shark 3 is the latest gaming phone from Xiaomi’s upstart subsidiary.
It sits below the Black Shark 3 Pro in the company’s current line up and aims to entice avid CoD and PUBG mobile players by offering flagship-level specs, plus a wealth of gaming-focused features, at a bargain price. These include a high refresh rate screen, improved cooling and support for the firm’s diverse portfolio of mobile gaming peripherals.
With pricing starting at a £539 the phone’s hardware is undeniably strong and the Black Shark 3 is a great handset for the niche, hardcore mobile gaming community it targets.
It has an ostentatious design and a few niggling issues with the phone’s software hinder it’s appeal to regular buyers, however. If you want something a little more traditional, there are plenty of other best mid-range phones and best phones.

Black Shark 3 design – A distinctly “gamer” look
Gaming phones always have marmite designs. The original Razer Phone had a uniquely blocky chassis, and Asus’ ROG Phones looked like they were built by Star Trek Klingons.
The Black Shark 3 is no different and has a distinctly “gamer” look. It features elements traditionally associated with over the top custom-built gaming PCs.
These include full-fat RGB lighting and a custom “X Core” design that loads two symmetrical diamond shapes onto the phone’s back – one for the camera housing and one for the optional magnetic charge cable’s connector.
I’m not a huge fan of RGB lighting on gaming PCs and laptops as, outside of keyboards, it’s, for the most part, a flashy excess that ramps up the devices’ price and makes it look like a children’s toy. The latter is still an issue on the Black Shark – trust me, outside of the ROG Phone 2 you won’t find a gaudier mobile – but it partially solves my primary quibble by offering easy to view notification alerts.
Round the side, there’s a custom switch which is used to turn the phone’s Shark Space 3.0 software on and off. Shark Space is a game-specific UI that lets you manage the phone’s peripherals, stream games and create custom profiles for specific apps. The feature is useful when gaming, but I can’t help wish the input was customisable so I could use it to do other actions, like silencing the phone.
Black Shark’s also made a few under the hood tweaks to boost the phone’s gaming chops. The three most important are its peripheral support, custom cooling system and atypical antenna placement.
Peripherals are a common site since Asus kicked off the trend with the original ROG Phone and the line up on offer here is pretty similar. With the Black Shark 3, you’ll be able to buy and attach optional BlackShark FunCooler Pro, Gamepad 3 peripherals and charge it using an 18W magnetic cable.
The fun cooler does what it says on the tin and helps stop the phone overheating and CPU throttling during prolonged game sessions. The gamepad slots onto the handset’s left side and gives you a physical joystick and d-pad to play with.
The peripherals are easy to use, and the gamepad, in particular, is great for PUBG to the point it feels like cheating. But given that you have to pay £50 more just to get the gamepad alone it is a pretty expensive luxury.
The fan cooler will also feel a little superfluous for anyone other than the most hardcore of gamers as the Black Shark 3’s new “Sandwich Liquid Cooling” system is fairly competent in its own right. The system places two super long cooling pipes in a doubled sided structure. According to Black Shark, the systems cooling area is 100% larger and 50% more efficient than the one seen on the Black Shark 2. Running CoD Mobile for prolonged periods, the system worked great, and I didn’t notice any background heat, even after 30 minutes playtime – when competing handsets like the Galaxy S20 start to warm up.
The “dual X” antenna design is another subtle, but on paper useful, gaming-focused feature. This has seen Black Shark litter the ten antennas around the phone’s sides in a way that, it claims, will ensure you never lose connectivity holding the phone in landscape, as pretty much all games require. Given that we’re in lockdown I haven’t a chance to test this, but it’s a neat touch if it works.
These features aside, the marmite design factor’s not helped by the fact it’s significantly chunkier and heavier than most competing, non-gaming, 6.67-inch handsets. This isn’t to say it’s as ridiculously big as it’s Pro sibling, which features a gigantic 7.1-inch screen, but it will take regular phone users some time to get used to its increased heft.
Despite its heft, the phone doesn’t feature any formal IP water resistance rating. This is relatively common on phones that are trying to remain semi-affordable, as you have to pay to get a handset IP certified. Thankfully, even without the IP rating, the Black Shark 3 feels well made – like a Nokia Lumia from the days of yore, and I’m reasonably sure the floor will come out worse if you accidentally drop a Black Shark 3 on it. It just means you’ll want to avoid giving it an accidental aquatic adventure.
The in-screen fingerprint scanner rounds off the phone’s main design features. During testing, the scanner worked just fine and generally didn’t throw up any false positives or struggle to read my digit.

Display – Pretty par for the course by gaming phone
On paper, the Black Shark 3’s 6.67-inch FHD+, 90Hz, AMOLED screen is pretty par for the course by gaming phone standards and roughly in line with other similarly priced handsets, like the OnePlus 8.
Spec heads will instantly ask why the phone has a 90Hz, not 120Hz display like the one seen on the Galaxy S20. According to Black Shark, it’s because most games don’t support 120Hz and doing so would radically ramp up the phone’s cost. Both points are fair, and for the most part, the display is great.
With the 90Hz setting on the phone is butter smooth to use. Paired with a 270Hz touch reporting rate, with 24ms touch latency – which makes it on paper 30% more reactive than Black Shark 2 Pro – it’s also radically more responsive than most competing handsets. Playing CoD and PUBG, there is no noticeable delay between me pressing the screen and the action happening.
The use of an AMOLED panel also means blacks are wonderfully inky, and support for the HDR10+ standard means compatible content looks wonderfully dynamic. My only slight quibble with screen quality is that colours look a little overcooked and it’s handling of varied refresh rates, like all phones, is a little clunky.
Like pretty much every phone the Black Shark’s isn’t truly variable. You have to go into the settings and tell it if you want it to run at 60Hz or 90Hz. I’ve always argued phones need to become truly variable and be able to optimise their refresh rate depending on what’s happening. These include things like running at the Hz rate of video content being played and lowering the number of images being rendered per second when there’s no benefit to a higher rate – a key move that will let it conserve battery.
Considering the fact no phone’s managed to do this yet, the lack of the functionality on the Black Shark is a forgivable omission, however.
The bigger issue is the phone’s super cinema mode. This is an annoying feature that forces video content to play at 90Hz, even if it’s not mastered that way. This creates a soap opera effect that makes even the best shot movie look terrible. Thankfully you can turn it off in the settings menu, which I strongly suggest any buyer does the moment they power the phone up.

Performance – The Black Shark 3 is more than powerful enough
When it comes to graphical grunt, the Black Shark 3 is firmly in flagship phone territory. Under the hood, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 CPU, with 5G connectivity and a choice of either 8GB (tested) or 12GB of RAM. This puts it in the same league as considerably more expensive handsets, like the Galaxy S20 Ultra and OnePlus 8 Pro.
The 8GB version I tested is more than powerful enough to run pretty much any app or game in the Play Store with zero issues. PUBG runs at its highest graphics settings with zero issues, and the phone’s cooling system meant I never experienced any CPU throttling.
Data speeds are also solid with the phone’s chipset supporting Wi-Fi 6 and 5G connectivity. Though given the current lockdown, I didn’t get a chance to check how the Black Shark 3 handles the latter.
Software – A mixed bag
Over the top Android skins have been a key issue plaguing most gaming phones. This continues with the Black Shark 3.
The custom JoyUI 11 skin Black Shark’s loaded over Android 10 isn’t the worst I’ve seen, but it’s still a mixed bag. It’s not as bad as the ROG Phone’s skin, but it adds some bloatware and makes a few pointless UI changes – why phone makers insist on swapping Android’s native contacts, calendar and file management apps for lessor clones in this day and age is beyond me.
Camera – Impressive considering the price
The Black Shark 3’s rear camera’s specs are impressive considering the phone’s price. It comes loaded with a tri-camera setup built of 13-megapixel ultra-wide, 5-megapixel bokeh and 64-megapixel clear (main) lenses.
The app also features all the various modes you’d expect, including auto, portrait, pro, night and panorama. There’s also a custom 64-megapixel option that lets you capture outright gigantic photos.
In the out of the box, the auto mode picture quality is more than good enough for sharing on social media. Shutter speeds are also reasonably good, and there’s not too big of a delay between you telling the phone to take a photo and it happening.
But the Black Shark 3 doesn’t match the quality of competing flagships, like the OnePlus 8 in a couple of key areas.
For starters, low light performance. Though the phone’s camera is functional in low light, shutter speeds begin to chug, and noise can on occasion creep in. Contrast levels also go out of the window, and light sources in dark conditions uniformly look overexposed.
The portrait mode works reasonably well, but it is more prone to picking up aberrations when making bokeh effects than competing handsets. The camera also has a tendency to overprocess shots, particularly when shooting in the 64-megapixel setting.
This isn’t to say the camera is bad, it’s just not quite as good as most similarly priced non-gaming handsets. You can see a selection of photos taken on the Black Shark 3 below.
    
Battery life – The Black Shark 3 has a giant battery, but performance is fairly average
The Black Shark 3’s powered by a giant 5000mAh battery. Using it as my main work and personal phone, I generally got between a day to a day and a half’s use out of it in the 90Hz setting.
An average day entailed listening to music, watching a couple of videos, a couple of games of CoD plus regularly checking and responding to incoming messages.
More intensive tasks do put a bigger drain on the battery, however. Streaming video over Wi-Fi the phone lost an average of 8-10% of its charge per hour with the cinema mode turned off. This is again fairly average for a 2020 flagship.
Gaming in 90Hz the battery discharged slightly faster than expected. On average it lost around 22-25% of its charge per hour playing PUBG and CoD in 90Hz. This went down to around 15-18% when the screen was locked to 60Hz, which is more in line with competing flagships.
Thankfully the addition of 65W fast charging tech means the phone is lightning fast to recharge if you use the supplied plug.

Should you buy the Black Shark 3?
If you’re part of the small number of people that actively want a gaming phone, then the Black Shark 3 is an excellent option. Under the hood, it has all the bells and whistles you’d expect of a top-notch gaming phone. With pricing starting at £539, it’s also very competitively priced.
However, it’s over the top design and overtly gaming focussed software will likely put off most regular buyers.

Verdict





























 



If you already own the previous-gen iPad Pro then there’s little here to warrant an upgrade. No real performance boosts and very few user-facing new features. You can even use the new Magic Keyboard with the older tablet.

But this is still a fantastic device, and for the right person it’s the best tablet going. It’s beautifully designed, packs a gorgeous display, and works with a bounty of strong add-ons and apps. It’s as close to a laptop replacement as I’ve found – even if it won’t be completely there for everyone.



Pros

Fantastic display
Lovely design
Great add-ons
Loud, detailed speakers
iPad apps keeps on getting better



Cons

Minimal upgrades from the previous version
Battery life upgrades would be welcome
As a package it gets very expensive

iPadOS with cursor support



Following a dramatic redesign in 2018, the latest version of the iPad Pro sticks close to what made its predecessor great.
The iPad Pro 2020 might have been somewhat overshadowed by the simultaneous launch of the Magic Keyboard accessory, but this high-end tablet has plenty going for it and it’s not only one of the best iPads, but also up there with the best tablets you can buy.
This version of the iPad Pro has now been updated to the iPad Pro (12.9-inch, 2021). The 2020 version reviewed here is no longer being sold but we have a full review of the newer model with the M1 chip, new screen tech and more.
Design and Screen 

Comes in two sizes: 12.9-inch and 11-inch
Support for the wireless Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard
120Hz ProMotion display is great

There were significant changes design-wise with the last iPad Pro (the 2018 model), so the likelihood of a notable redesign this time around was always going to be slim. Over the past few years, Apple has become known for retaining the look of its devices through multiple generations, and that’s the case here.
The iPad Pro 2020 is virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor – and considering how gorgeous the former tablet remains, this is far from a bad thing. If current rumours are to be believed, it even appears that Apple will be borrowing elements of the design used here for the upcoming iPhone 12.
Instead of mirroring the older, classic iPad design (which is still very much alive in the iPad Mini and Air), the iPad Pro more closely resembles the iPhone 5 series. Curves are swapped for straight lines, alongside definitive edges and a flat back. Four speakers sit at either end, with a USB-C port for charging along the bottom.

The new iPad Pro feels very much like a device that will be used horizontally, with keyboard attachments and the like. And in that vein I’d have liked to have seen the very good front camera positioned at the top, rather than on the side. 
You can pick up the iPad Pro 2020 in two sizes, 11 inches and 12.9 inches, in both silver and space grey. Both models feature identical hardware, accessory support and the same overall design. Basically, which you opt for will be determined by size and, well, price. 
I used an 11-inch Pro for a few years and loved the portability, but switching to the 12.9-inch model does show that for many it will be the more practical choice. If you’re looking for a device to compliment your laptop then the 11-inch will be ideal. The larger model is far superior for multitasking.
For use as a regular tablet, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro takes some getting used to. Once you’re familiar with that huge screen, however, the device is an absolute pleasure to use, especially for design work and drawing. It’s great for reading, too, in particular for large-format magazines. 
Of course, the 11-inch model is lighter (471g versus 641g for the Wi-Fi model); however, both versions of the iPad Pro are 5.9mm thick.
Also similar in both versions of the iPad Pro 2020 is the screen tech found inside. You don’t need to plump for the larger version to get all the high-end features.
The display is a true highlight, even if there haven’t been any notable upgrades over the previous version. It remains the finest screen on any tablet, even if a switch to OLED rather than LCD would be the icing on the cake.
It’s a 120Hz ProMotion display, with P3 colour gamut support, a reported 600 nits of brightness and a 264ppi across both models. The LCD (or Liquid Retina as Apple likes to call them) is sharp, responsive and supremely colourful.
It’s the ProMotion tech that really stands out, though. It dynamically shifts the refresh rate up and down to deliver the smoothest possible image without draining the battery too quickly. I say “too quickly”, but as I’ll cover in the “Battery” section, the iPad Pro’s battery life isn’t consistently fantastic.
So while phones with these high refresh screens are either locked to 120Hz or 60Hz, the iPad switches this up depending on what you’re doing. Watching a video, where a higher refresh rate is of limited value? This device will lower it itself. It’s clever tech that I really hope is adopted in at least some iPhone 12 models.

The ProMotion tech also helps if you’re drawing and sketching using the Apple Pencil. The £129/$129 stylus charges wirelessly and addresses the majority of issues with the first-gen Pencil. Drawing is responsive and there are lots of fantastic apps – including Procreate, a favourite that offers deep drawing and sketching tools. For taking notes I’ve been impressed by Notability, which again makes very good use of the Apple Pencil.

LIDAR scanner for 3D depth mapping
iOS remains the best OS for tablets

Normally you’d expect a new iPad Pro to come with a far superior chip to the silicon sitting inside its predecessor. This isn’t necessarily so here, though. Instead of building upon the A13 Bionic from the iPhone 12 series, the iPad Pro 2020 takes the A12 from the older Pro and replaces the X numerical with Z.
The Z prefix relates to the graphics performance, which here is boosted thanks to the unlocking of an extra GPU core. And that’s it.
Things are more different with the camera array. This is the first iPad to boast two main camera sensors: a 12-megapixel f/1.8 main sensor and a secondary 10-megapixel ultra-wide camera. Both take good, if not great, pictures. The ultra-wide unit’s shots are a lot softer than the iPhone 11, and while the main camera captures well in good light, your phone is likely to do a better job. On the front is a 7-megapixel TrueDepth camera, which is far better than a MacBook Pro or Air for video calling. This camera also enables the very accurate Face ID system.
The most interesting new addition to the camera array is a LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor. This is basically a 3D sensor that uses similar ToF (time of flight) tech to Android phones. Its main functionality here is for augmented reality, giving these apps more accurate data to work with. It’s a neat addition, but until many more apps make use of it, it feels like a feature most won’t use.
I can’t say I’m a fan of high-end cameras on iPads. The added size of the module means the iPad rocks around on a desk and a lesser spec-heavy array might have brought down the overall price of the device. Although, in another vein it feels as if Apple is so far ahead of the competition when it comes to high-end tablets that additions such as LiDAR are the only meaningful updates it can introduce.

According to the Geekbench benchmarking app, both models of iPad Pro come with 6GB of RAM. While the 1TB 2018 iPad Pros also came with this amount, the smaller storage options packed 4GB. Base storage has jumped to 128GB, a decent increase over the paltry 64GB offered for the price before.
The previous iPad Pro was nippy, and this new version is that too. The extra graphics grunt isn’t obvious, though, so I’m not sure I’d recommend upgrading for that addition alone. Still, the chip here is so supremely capable, outperforming the rest of the market. I played my way through a number of games, both from Apple Arcade and the App Store, and all performed without a hitch – however, they also play well on the latest iPad Mini. Benchmark scores from Geekbench 4 show similar scores to the 2018 version of the iPad Pro, with a 1117 single-core score and 4640 for the multi-core.
I exported 10 minutes of 4K faster here than on a 2016 MacBook Pro –  a basic test, yes, but it shows how far these tablets have come. Editing huge Raw files in Lightroom also proved a pleasant experience; using the Pencil and your fingers to manipulate images is so much better than making changes on a far away display.
As mentioned, the iPad Pro 2020 comes with four speakers that sit on the device’s sides – and they sound great. They’re loud, detailed and display good separation. It’s a shame there’s no headphone jack, however; its lack of inclusion on a tablet is far more irksome than on a phone.
As has been the case with previous high-end iPads, a 4G (no 5G here yet) model is available alongside the Wi-Fi version. The former is a little heavier, pricier and features a few extra antenna lines, but the changes are minimal.
Software
It was iOS’s limitations that once held back the iPad. With iPadOS, this is no longer the case – well, in most instances anyway.
The latest version of the software powering the iPad is the best yet, at least in trying to make this machine as productive as ever.
For instance, cursor and trackpad support is well implemented, even if apps need to be updated to make proper use of it. Apple’s Pages app is a pleasure to use with an attached mouse or trackpad (Apple’s Magic Keyboard, for instance), with the cursor morphing into buttons when required. This doesn’t yet work with Google Docs (whose experience remains poor on an iPad) and it won’t be coming to Word until later in the year.
Multi-tasking is a similar story. In apps that properly support it, it’s great; but you can’t simply reshape any window as you do on a regular computer. It works well, until you’re hit with a restriction that stems your workflow. I’d say the iPad Pro 2020 serves me well for completing 90% of my day-to-day tasks; but it’s that last 10% that stops the device from being a true MacBook replacement.
At least the iPad remains king when it comes to apps and services. The app selection here is excellent, with powerful tools and games. iPadOS has added the ability to import snaps directly, offering significant benefit with apps such as Lightroom, bypassing the need to first add them to the Photos app.
Accessories
Along with the Apple Pencil, the company offers a few more add-ons whose aim is to make working on the iPad Pro 2020 akin to working on a laptop. The highlight is the new Magic Keyboard – a £299/£349 (same price in $) unit that offers a fantastic typing experience, if you’re willing to splash the cash.
Unlike the keyboard folio, the Magic Keyboard packs a responsive trackpad, backlit keys and passthrough USB-C charging. It “floats” on the display with the help of super-strong magnets. It also ditches the fabric-covered keys for chiclet buttons similar to those found on the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro.

Pair the Magic Keyboard with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and you have a setup that’s actually heavier than a MacBook Air – and thicker, too. Even the keyboard on its own weighs more than the iPad. Still, it’s a productive setup on which typing is a pleasurable experience.
There’s no doubting it’s a lot to spend on a keyboard, though. Opting for an 11-inch iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard will take you to a price that’s very similar to the base MacBook Air.
Battery life

Not much of an upgrade over previous models
USB-C for charging 

There hasn’t been much change to the battery life on iPads over the years, with the majority of currently available slates from Apple claiming around 10 hours of media playback.
The iPad Pro 2020 offers decent endurance, although how you use it will alter the time it lasts quite drastically. For instance, if you’re replacing your laptop with this machine and using it for a full workday, expect to charge the iPad Pro every night. Still, that’s a lot more impressive than any Apple laptop.
Watching streamed video on the big screen, and gaming, can be real battery hogs. A couple of hours of video streamed from the Now TV app consumed 25% of the iPad Pro’s battery. The results fare better with downloaded content. I noticed fast depletion with lots of photo importing and editing in Lightroom, although I was able to draw for hours without much loss.
USB-C is the main connector here and it’s far superior to Lightning. Not only does it mean you can use a bunch of chargers (like the one from a recent MacBook, or even Windows laptop), but it lets you plug in hard-drives, thumb sticks and dongles. You could, for instance, charge your Apple Watch directly from the iPad – I use this handy Satechi Apple Watch charger that gets rid of wires completely. 
Price
There are two screen size variants the iPad Pro 2020, with pricing as follows for the 11-inch models:

iPad Pro 11-inch 128GB: £769
iPad Pro 11-inch 256GB: £869
iPad Pro 11-inch 512GB: £1069
iPad Pro 11-inch 1TB: £1269


Meanwhile, the 12.9-inch variants have the following prices:

iPad Pro 12.9-inch 128GB: £969
iPad Pro 12.9-inch 256GB: £1069
iPad Pro 12.9-inch 512GB: £1269
iPad Pro 12.9-inch 1TB: £1469

You should buy it if…
You want a huge screen with ProMotion
You can only get a 12.9-inch display if you go Pro, with all other iPads coming in smaller sizes. This is also the only iPad with the smooth 120hz ProMotion panel and that makes everything from gaming to drawing feel a lot better.
Appreciate tablet photography
This is the best tablet around for pictures and video, plus the LiDAR opens up new avenues into AR shooting and better 3D depth mapping.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
120Hz isn’t important
If you’re not fussed about having the 120Hz display or the choice of a 12.9-inch size then really you’re best off looking at the iPad Air 4.

The TCL 10 Pro is similar to a OnePlus device, in that it looks like a high-end mobile, but without the accompanying high price. In fact, right now it’s £200 cheaper than the OnePlus 8 at £399.
While the name maybe unfamiliar to the majority, you’ll certainly have come across some of the products TCL makes.
As well as being responsible for production of BlackBerry phones of the past few years, TCL also makes Alcatel phones under license. The company also manufactures a number of TVs. Hence, TCL is no tech newbie; it’s a Chinese giant. However, this is the first time we’ve seen a TCL phone marketed as such and sold along western shores.
The good news is that, for the £399 price, this phone looks and feels fantastic. General performance is excellent, the core hardware hasn’t seen any major cut corners, a headphone jack is included, and the screen is great.
However, the TCL 10 Pro doesn’t offer 5G, the gorgeous matte-glass rear of the device is too easy to damage, the interface requires some tweaking to get it just right, and camera processing could do with a lighter touch. In addition, the TCL 10 Pro faces strong competition from the Xiaomi Realme 6, which is cheaper.

TCL 10 Pro design – A quality finish, with glass front and back
Today, you won’t find many phones at £400 that feel as expensive as the TCL 10 Pro. This is especially true now that models such as the Motorola Moto G8 Plus come sporting plastic rears.
The TCL 10 Pro features genuine glass front and back panels, with aluminium sitting between. The glass used here is Gorilla Glass 5, and both back and front have a true curvature that’s far beyond the 2.5D glass you usually see at the price. The latter is usually little more than flat glass with rounded-off edges.
The result is a device that looks and feels fantastic, particularly given the price is now considered somewhere in the lower regions of “mid-range”.
I’m particularly enamoured by the TCL 10 Pro’s rear finish. The back is matte, interrupted only by the strip that holds the cameras, and sports a subtle gradient. Silver at the bottom becomes black at the top. TCL’s decision to arrange the cameras in a line, creating symmetry with two separate LED flashes, is also a nice touch.
It was only following two weeks with the device that I discovered an issue with the TCL 10 Pro design. The rear finish is too easy to scratch, and the phone doesn’t come with a case or a screen protector.
In addition, the almost flat rear means the cameras sit on the same pane of glass as the rest of the rear, and this too is concerning. However, those two LED flashes aren’t just for show. Their plastic caps sit a fraction above the glass, which means when resting on its rear, the phone is actually sitting on these caps. Potential crisis averted.
All of the TCL 10 Pro’s side buttons are metal; there’s no sense this is a “cheap” Chinese phone – which can be the case with devices from smaller brands such as Doogee and Cubot.


The TCL 10 Pro comes with a few rare extras, too. A 3.5mm headphone jack sits along its top, alongside an IR blaster. Used in conjunction with the IR Remote app, it allows the phone to replace remotes for your TV, home cinema receiver, anything that uses an IR signal.
I’m pleased to report that it works well, with the app having lots of presets for popular UK and US brands.
The TCL 10 Pro also has an in-screen fingerprint scanner. In use it proved patchy until the day before this review was first published, when TCL fixed issues via a software update. Now I’d consider it one of the very best finger scanners I’ve seen in a mid-range phone. Quick and fairly reliable, there are no complaints here.
So what’s missing? The TCL 10 Pro is lacking any official water-resistance, and the phone’s speaker inclusion is only mono.
In addition, one of the TCL 10 Pro’s side buttons is rather annoying. On the right you’ll find standard power and volume buttons; a Google Assistant button sits on the left side. The issue is that it’s all too easy to accidentally depress the latter in your pocket, bringing up Assistant when the phone is asleep.
And to prove my point, I’ve done this approximately 864 times to date. Thankfully, there is an option in Settings that allows Assistant to be evoked only via a long press. I recommend using it.

TCL 10 Pro screen – Vibrant colours, superb contrast and excellent brightness
The TCL 10 Pro’s 2340 x 1080 pixel OLED screen is a highlight. While it may not be quite up to the standards of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra’s display, it has all of the same basic hallmarks.
Contrast is predictably superb, motion handling is excellent, colours are vibrant and top brightness is sufficient for decent clarity on sunny days.
There are subtler signs of the TCL 10 Pro’s display quality, too. Curved OLED displays can leave a phone with edges that look dimmer than the rest, but the effect is minimal here. There’s also very minor shift in colour tone when viewed from an angle. Less advanced OLED screens can take on a blue tint when they’re not viewed dead-on.
None of the certification essentials are missed, either. The TCL 10 Pro can already stream HDR and HD Netflix (you’d assume this is a given, but it isn’t) and HDR YouTube videos.
TCL puts its own spin on screen optimisation, too: Nxtvision. This is really just a fancy name for the part of the Settings menu that lets you customise the display, but it does include some neat features.

There are colour character presets (choose your vividness level), an SDR-to-HDR converter filter and Reading mode. With the latter you choose for apps to run in a warm, low saturation mode – which, I suppose, is meant to be easier on your eyes.
One recommendation I do have is using the TCL 10 Pro’s Gentle colour mode. This phone doesn’t behave differently in the Gallery, so if your colour profile is an extra-saturated one, then your photos will look that way too. As such, a photo viewed on your Instagram account will appear more vivid on your phone screen compared to how it’s seen on someone else’s device. That’s a no-no.
Handsets from Samsung, for example, offer smarter screen calibration that ensures your photos appear true-to-reality no matter the colour mode used.
Screen-wise, this is the only part of the TCL 10 Pro’s setup that I’ve found disappointing.
The phones maximum brightness of 600 nits is nowhere near the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra’s 1300-odd. Resolution is much lower, too. Nevertheless, the screen is sharp and bright enough to be usable on super-light days, lowering the real-world impact of these differences.
It’s a cracker of a screen at the price, and better than that of the Samsung Galaxy A51.
TCL 10 Pro software and performance – An initial tweak of the interface will make life easier in the long-run
The TCL 10 Pro runs Android 10 with a software layer on top called, imaginatively, TCL UI.
Initial reactions can be summed up as, “Oh my, this is trash.” However, I quickly learned that in only a few taps of the screen I was able to undo the weird default setup of this interface.
First to be changed was the app menu layout. It comes arranged by category as standard, which is completely impractical. Your app drawer ends up being three miles long, with half of your apps ending up in an “other” category. Handy.
Switch the app screen to order alphabetically and suddenly TCL UI starts to look as good as most other interfaces.It’s also possible to order apps by icon colour. It’s looks attractive – but, again, it’s simply impractical.

I also recommend maxing out the number of app rows and columns. This is a big screen, fully capable of handling the extra icons.
Other parts of the TCL 10 Pro interface are also impressive, not showing any signs of TCL over-reaching to add a distinctive character to the phone. There’s an extra homescreen, but it’s just the standard Google feed. The Settings menu is simple enough to navigate and while the lock-screen is a TCL design, you can switch to the standard Google-style one if you prefer.
So, first impressions of the TCL 10 Pro software maybe poor, but the issues are really surface-level. It took only two minutes of tweaking to knock the interface into a shape I actually like.
General performance, too, is excellent. I saw far more responsive transitions and much lower lag than I experienced the week before using the Samsung Galaxy A51. The TCL 10 Pro has a snappy feel not dissimilar to a true high-end phone.
TCL 10 Pro performance – Super snappy
And to achieve that snappy performance, the TCL 10 Pro doesn’t include any extraordinary hardware. The device has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor accompanied by 6GB of RAM, which is slightly better than the Google Pixel 3a XL‘s Snapdragon 670.
The CPU in the TCL 10 Pro is relatively old, announced back in 2018. The Snapdragon 730G is an obvious newer alternative, and can be found in the Xiaomi Note 10.
But is it actually better? The TCL 10 Pro scores 1573 in Geekbench 5, compared to the Xiaomi Mi Note 10’s 1714.
Those willing to spend a little more might also want to consider the PocoPhone F2. It comes with a Snapdragon 865, plus a far more powerful processor than either the TCL 10 Pro’s or Xiaomi Mi Note 10’s.
The TCL 10 Pro’s snappiness is more likely down to low added software overheads and the use of fast RAM and internal storage. We get LPDDR4X RAM here, which is the same type used in top-end phones. It can handle data at 17GB/s. And the storage reads at an SSD-like 509MB/s.
TCL 10 Pro gaming – Great with most titles, but the speaker disappoints
A slightly older mid-range Snapdragon CPU leaves the TCL 10 Pro with the same Adreno 612 graphics chipset as phones such as the Moto G8 Plus. And, again, performance falls short of that of the Xiaomi Mi Note 10.
Play a game such as Ark: Survival Evolved and you’ll have to drop the graphics down from the top Epic setting to Medium to make it comfortably playable.
However, only a few games make the difference between the TCL 10 Pro’s mid-range processor and a high-end one all that evident. PUBG runs smoothly at “high” graphics with anti-aliasing switched on. Call of Duty Mobile runs well, too.

I’d rather have a phone with a Snapdragon 865, but the TCL 10 Pro is still great for gaming.
The speaker is the most obvious let-down while playing. Its one-sided delivery, firing from the bottom, is obvious. In addition, the speaker’s tone is thinner than many.
TCL 10 Pro camera – It doesn’t quite hit the heights of rival cameras
The TCL 10 Pro has four cameras arranged in a smart-looking line along its rear. Only two of them feel essential, though, as with many quad-camera phones at this level.
There are standard and ultra-wide views, but no zoom. The third and fourth cameras are 2-megapixel sensors for background blur photos and a 5-megapixel macro.
Macro photos are passable, with greater close-up detail than you’d see from the main camera. However, the macro isn’t good enough to make me want to actually use it regularly. Portrait depth images aren’t great, either. Too often you’ll see images that look unnatural thanks to dodgy depth mapping.
This is no great surprise when companies such as Huawei and Samsung have made far more high-end phones. The development has justified spending big on optimising  depth-mapping algorithms, for example.
The macro camera does let you shoot ultra-close shots such as this; but the results can be disappointingRelatively low-end camera hardware doesn’t quite do justice to the texture of these petals and the stamen detail 
The portrait (background blur) mode struggles with more complicated scenes
The TCL 10 Pro’s “extra” cameras aren’t big hits then, but the other two fare better.
Our main camera has a 64-megapixel Samsung S5KGW1 sensor, a large 1/1.72-inch 64-megapixel chip. It’s used across a bunch of Xiaomi phones including the Remi Note 9 Pro, but only one Samsung line to my knowledge – the Galaxy A71. Despite being rich in megapixels, Samsung doesn’t use it in its top-end phones.
However, image quality is decent with some caveats. I’ll deal with the good bits, then move to the issues.
The TCL 10 Pro offers solid dynamic range enhancement, and is particularly adept at bringing out shadow detail. You can shoot right into the sun and get usable photos, so you don’t have to worry about the direction of light as much as you may with a dedicated camera.

Colours are bold and vibrant. While they might appear a little juiced-up compared to those seen on the Google Pixel 3a XL or Xiaomi Note 10, they’re not distractingly overdone.
The phone’s  64-megapixel mode deconstructs how the camera is designed to operate, and likely uses a composite of multiple exposures given how long it takes. But they do look appreciably better down at pixel level.
Image quality of the ultra-wide camera is decent, too. It uses the 16-megapixel Samsung s5K3p9 sensor (1/3.1 inch). Hardware is less advanced and images tend to display a fine mist of grain across them; but this is only visible on zooming. Day-lit ultra-wide images are entirely usable, and having a second field of view is always welcome.
The TCL 10 Pro starts to seem less impressive when compared to the best-in-class phones.
Its exposure metering leans slightly too much towards making your images bright and vivid. As a result, there are often small areas of overexposure even after the dynamic range processing has done its thing.

Less careful exposure handling than some causes overexposure issues, seen in the block white areas in the sky cover
In addition, general image processing isn’t nearly as good as that of Google, Xiaomi or Huawei phones at the price. Fine textures sometimes end up looking “painted”, turning gravel into brush strokes, and fine detail is over-sharpened.
The Google Pixel 3a XL and Xiaomi Mi Note 10 are considerably better in this respect. It’s no disaster for the TCL 10 Pro’s camera, though, since it’s able to render better shadow detail than the Samsung Galaxy A51.
I’d expect this area of TCL phones to improve if the company continues in its attempts to become a bigger player in own-brand phones. And it may even get better with software updates. Here are some comparisons, with a test scene:
 
The TCL and Xiaomi high-res modes do have benefits if you need to crop into images post-shootThe Pixel and Xiaomi phones handle the texture of the rear wall and the concrete far better than the Galaxy or TCL. Also note how the leaves and grass look far more “stressed” than images from other phones, as a result of sharpening. Still, the TCL’s fence shows more detail than the Samsung Galaxy A51’s.
The phone has a dedicated night mode, but it doesn’t come close to the Google Pixel 3a’s Night Sight offering. Night mode focuses on bringing out more shadow detail rather than using advanced computational photography techniques to improve detail and clarity. You can use it during the day, too, but this results in flat-looking images.
Night images are fairly poor, whether or not this specific mode is engaged.

The Google Pixel 3a XL has a far better night mode than any of these phones. TCL’s 10 Pro brings up the rear, with a dim shot that features less detail than the rest, although it’s similar to the Galaxy A51, but darker.
There’s also a little shutter lag to the TCL 10 Pro camera. It’s only around a third of a second, but this is noticeable when comparing directly to phones from some of the better-known names.
While I have more complaints than praise for the TCL 10 Pro cameras, I’m mostly happy with their performance. TCL may have made BlackBerry phones for a few years, but as the first full TCL phone I’ve used, it’s reassuring to see its efforts aren’t miles behind the competition. Just several hundred metres.

That said, this camera array isn’t as advanced at it looks. And don’t bother using the zoom. The app lets you go to 10x, but the results are awful. Here’s a demo shot, followed by a few more successful images taken with the TCL 10 Pro:

Is it a ladybird?

This image was taken with the ultra-wide camera
This shows off the phone’s handling of colour: a bit keen but pleasant
Video capture tops out at 4K resolution, 30 frames a second. And, unusually, there are no 60fps capture modes, even at 1080p or below.
However, 4K/30 does support electronic image stabilisation, which is a must if you want handheld footage to look smooth.
The TCL 10 Pro’s selfie camera uses a high-resolution 24-megapixel sensor, but it isn’t particularly impressive.
TCL 10 Pro battery life – Will get you to the end of the day, just
The TCL 10 Pro has a 4500mAh battery, a capacity that seems chosen to balance stamina with the phone’s thickness. I find the 5260mAh of a model such as the Xiaomi Note 10 more reassuring, but that phone is significantly thicker.
This phone’s stamina is passable, but little more. I find it claws its way to the end of the day, but often with under 10% charge remaining. This isn’t a handset on which you should rely on a long night out, or when GPS navigating through an unknown city all day long. Unless you bring an external battery, anyway.

The TCL 10 Pro battery seems to underperform for its size, so I tried it out against the Google Pixel 3a XL and Xiaomi Mi Note 10 using Geekbench 4’s battery test. It came out with 5182 points, fewer than the Pixel’s 5344 – even though that phone has a smaller 3700mAh battery.
And the Xiaomi Ni Note 10? Unsurprisingly, it’s far ahead with 8513 points. These scores are abstractions, but provide a relative idea of the phones’ real battery life. The TCL 10 Pro’s should be at least a little better considering its 4500mAh capacity.
The phone does come with an 18W fast charger. It isn’t the most powerful around but still able to offer good speeds. From flat, a 30-minute top-up will get you to 43%. An hour so this figure reach 80%. No issues here; it’s fast enough for a mid-price phone.
There’s no wireless charging, but the TCL 10 Pro does support OTG charging. This lets you use the phone’s battery to charge other devices. It’s handy if you need to give your wireless headphones a quick boost.

Should you buy the TCL 10 Pro?
If you’re looking for a phone that offers what OnePlus models once did then you may be mildly disappointed by the TCL 10 Pro. It doesn’t come housing a top-tier Qualcomm processor; just the kind you’d expect to see at the price and there are better best mid-range phones out there.
However, the TCL 10 Pro does have a lovely glass and metal build, plus an excellent curved OLED screen whose appearance isn’t too far away from phones in our best phone list. The 10 Pro is a high-class, lower cost phone of the type we mostly only see from Chinese brands these days.
A few issues stop it earning a higher score. Battery life should be better than it is considering the TCL 10 Pro has a solid Qualcomm CPU and a 4500mAh battery. There’s no zoom, and the cameras and image processing isn’t as good as that of the bigger names. This impacts low-light performance, too, which is fairly poor.
That said, this remains a decent phone if you’re wanting a curved OLED display at a sensible price. What’s essential is that you buy a case: while the matte glass finish looks and feels fantastic, it’s easy to damage.

Verdict
































The Motorola G8 is a good device that offers a good main camera and decent performance for the price.



Pros
Good main cameraDecent performance and battery lifeImpressive value

Cons
Screen is not the best

Key Specifications
Review Price: £179.994000mAh battery6.4-inch LCD display3.5mm headphone jackSnapdragon 665 chipset161.3×75.8x9mm, 188.3g4GB RAM / 64GB storage16-megapixel wide angle camera, 8-megapixel ultrawide lens2-megapixel macro lens, 8-megapixel selfie camera

The Motorola G8 is part of the series of budget Motorola phones that are renowned for offering great value for money. 
There are several members of the series each year, including the Moto G8 Power, Moto G8 Plus, and Moto G8 Play. The Moto G8 sits more or less square in the middle of the series, offering more features than the Play but fewer than the Plus or Power.
It’s got a considerable battery and a total of three rear cameras, but is it worth your cash?
Motorola G8 design – Big and eye-catching, with a headphone jack
The Moto G8 has a 6.4-inch screen, so it’s a fairly large handset. Relatively thick bezels run around the edge of the screen, and there’s a cut-out selfie camera set into the top-left corner of the display.

The rear panel of this device is a smart, vivid blue shade. The colour takes the eye, although the design isn’t particularly remarkable. There are good functional touches too, including a Micro SD card slot for expandable storage and a 3.5mm headphone jack for headphones. There’s a single speaker at the top of the screen, and music played through this sounded fairly crisp and had some depth.
There’s a rear fingerprint scanner on mounted on the rear of the device – to begin with, this could be a bit temperamental, but after a day or two of usage, it seemed more reliable.
It’s supplied in the box with a clear plastic case to keep it safe from bumps and scrapes.
Display – Not the sharpest or brightest, but what you would expect for a budget phone
The display measures 6.4-inches and has a resolution of 720 x 1560 pixels. Some people might find the cut-out notch a little distracting, but I soon got used to it, but the screen has a couple of other technical limitations that did bother me a bit.

This isn’t the sharpest display around, and at close inspection, you’ll notice that small text, for example, is noticeably pixellated and therefore appears a little blurry. On top of that, I found that it was best to keep the brightness higher on the scale than usual with a phone in order to see clearly.
The screen is not one of this device’s best features – if you consume a lot of video content on your phone, it’s worth investing more money for a better screen. Still, when you consider the price it’s a sacrifice that’s always going to have to be made.
Performance – The G8 is a strong performer for under £200
The Moto G8 runs on a Snapdragon 665 chipset with 4GB of RAM. While that’s a firmly mid-range processor, it’s pretty good going for the price. I noticed no slowdown or lag during my daily usage, though the more demanding games didn’t run as smoothly.
The recorded benchmark scores are posted below in comparison to its peers; unsurprisingly, this device scores near-identically to the G8 Power, given that they both have the same set-up.

Overall, it gives a good performance for a device costing below £200, so it’s a good bet from that standpoint.


Motorola Moto G8 battery life – A strong performer, but not as impressive as the G8 Power
The battery capacity is 4000mAh, which is a good healthy amount for any smartphone, and especially a budget-friendly one like this. I found that it was enough to get me through a busy day of usage. Watching a video after fully charging, the battery was drained to 95% after an hour, and 90% after two hours.
The charging speed was adequate but not especially snappy, as you can see from this table:

90%



Overall, battery delivered a strong performance, although if it’s your top priority, then the Motorola G8 Power might be a better option.
Motorola Moto G8 camera – Good for the price, and will suit most photographic needs
The Moto G8 has a 16-megapixel main sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. Reading the specs sheet I was surprised to see only three cameras listed – but the fourth sensor you can see is actually a Laser AF module for better auto-focus; despite this, I still found myself tapping the screen to focus on areas of the shot I wanted to focus on.
Motorola G8: Main Camera
I found that the main camera was good. The level of detail was pleasantly surprising, and colours were realistic without the garish enhancements sometimes employed to make up for hardware deficiencies.
Motorola G8: Ultrawide Camera
There’s a loss of detail and no little distortion when you switch to ultrawide. It’s useful to have an extra lens for some variety, but for the most part, I’d prefer sticking to the main camera.
Motorola G8: Main Camera
Night shots were usable though not spectacular. A considerable amount of detail is lost, and highlights are not as well controlled as you’d like, but the images weren’t terribly grainy to the point of being pointless.

AI-enabled (left) / AI disabled (right)
One of the things I found disappointing about the camera was its AI. This is the same plate of food shot with the automatically-recognised “Food” filter, and on the left without; the main difference seems to be a strong yellow tinge. This is likely intended to make the plate look warm and appealing (and for my cooking that’s a challenge beyond the reach of any existing technology), but this doesn’t work in all contexts, and I preferred to keep the AI switched off.
Overall the main camera is good for the price and should suit most of your photography needs. However, there’s not the variety of lenses that some rivals offer (a telephoto lens, for instance), and the AI could have been better.
Should you buy the Motorola Moto G8?
The Moto G8 is certainly a device worth considering if you’re on a £200 budget. However, I reckon it would be worth saving a little more for the Motorola G8 Power. This handset has a handy extra camera, a much larger battery, and a markedly better screen, while the price is not drastically higher.
The Motorola G8 is a good phone for this price point, delivering a strong processor, a large screen and a reliable camera.  However, the camera isn’t as versatile as I would have liked, and the screen quality is fairly lacking.

Verdict



































This is a fantastic upgrade for those with an iPhone 8 or older, and you will notice big changes, and a lot of familiarities, in the switch. It’s also just a downright excellent buy if you want a phone that’ll perform fast and take excellent pictures for years to come. 



Pros
At $399/£419 this is an excellent buyFlagship performance should keep this speedy for yearsGreat photos in daylight situationsImpressive video capabilitiesOffers a strong proposition for those who don’t want big phones

Cons
Battery life is far from excellentA new design would’ve been welcome

Review Price: £4194.7-inch displayA13 chipset12MP f/1.8 cameraiOS 13TouchID

 
Apple’s latest phone might not have been the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, but the new iPhone SE 2 is the perfect phone for the current uncertain time.
Apple has taken the body of the iPhone 8, mixed in internals from its iPhone 11 Pro and released it as its most affordable phone you can buy at the moment. Some may call it lazy, but those people won’t have used the iPhone SE 2.
Price and release date
The iPhone SE 2 is the cheapest new iPhone around, but it’s significantly more expensive in the UK than it is in the US. Here are the iPhone SE 2 UK prices and configurations:

iPhone SE 2 (64GB) − £419 ($399 in the US, which is approximately £320)
iPhone SE 2 (128GB) − £469 ($449 in the US, which is approximately £400)
iPhone SE 2 (256GB) − £569 ($549 in the US, which is approximately £440)

The original iPhone SE was available for just £379 at launch, which sounds scarcely believable next to today’s sky-high smartphone prices. Of course, that was way back in 2016, when even the price of the year’s flagship handset (the iPhone 6S) was a mere £539.
The iPhone 8, which has now been discontinued by Apple, originally started at £699 (64GB) in September 2017. However, it’s still available from third-party retailers and will be cheaper than ever.
The iPhone SE 2 was available to preorder from April 17 and started shipping to buyers on April 24.
Design

The iPhone SE 2 design is so familiar, maybe too much so

When I unboxed the iPhone SE 2, I put it up against the iPhone 11 Pro Max and couldn’t quite believe the sheer size difference. The SE 2 feels miniature next to the comparable beast of the Pro Max, almost toylike in its size.
And while the size won’t be for those who watch lots of movies or YouTube on their phones, or edit snaps or play hours and hours of games on the go, it’s refreshing using a device that doesn’t dominate my hands.
iPhone SE 2 (left) vs iPhone 11 Pro Max (right)
This is a true one-handed phone that sits right in the middle of my palm. My thumb can stretch from one side of the 4.7-inch display to other with ease – a feeling I haven’t had on a new phone in a long time.
However, the design remains my biggest qualm with the SE 2. It’s just so…familiar. I’ve used this phone on so many different occasions throughout the past six years, and it looks just like the iPhone 6 from 2014. Thick, chunky bezels surrounding the display? Check; Rounded corners? Check; TouchID home button? Check; Glass back? Check.
It would have been great to see Apple try a little harder with the design; stretching that screen out more or using some of the tricks it has learned with the TouchID-less iPhones of the last few years. Taking that SE branding brings back memories of the gorgeous iPhone 5 era design, with its clinical metallic look – it would have been far better to see some of that inspiration infused here, especially as the rumoured iPhone 12 series is said to have some of that design DNA.

At least the red-on-black of my review unit is a lovely colour combination. It’s also available in black and white, all with a black front. 
Like the iPhone 8 which this mirrors, there’s an IP67 rating for water resistance and a distinct lack of a 3.5mm jack.  
Screen

Don’t want a big screen? The iPhone SE 2 is ideal

The quality of the LCDs Apple has used in its iPhones have always been exceptional. Even though the resolution here is fairly low, at 4.7-inches, it looks sharp and detailed in all manner of situations.
Everything about the display feels very much like the iPhone 8, and it’s a world away from the 120Hz quad HD panels you’ll find on Android flagships in 2020. Still, it’s bright and colour accurate, and packs True Tone for kinder colours and has great viewing angles. There’s also no notch digging into the screen, just a rectangular 16:9 panel – hello 2016.

It is very small, though. That might be a bonus for some and the single biggest reason for skipping this device for others. A larger, possibly 5.5-inch Plus version was rumoured but, currently, it’s not available, and it seems we might be waiting until 2021 for that device to appear. 
Performance

The iPhone SE 2 feels like it’ll last for years with ease

It might look like a phone that wouldn’t feel out of place in 2016, but it’s got the guts of a £1000 device straight out of 2020. Like the iPhone 11 Pro Max (a phone that can cost up to £1500 in the UK), the iPhone SE 2 packs the supremely-capable A13 Bionic chipset. There is also, according to Geekbench benchmarking app, 3GB RAM.
Reports have suggested that the chip is underclocked somewhat, and the below benchmarking scores do represent a slight difference when compared to the iPhone 11 series, however you’re still getting the fastest mobile chip out there in a £400 phone – that’s impressive stuff.

Along with handling any game on the App Store or Apple Arcade with ease (nothing I played had even the slightest hint of lag), this chip should ensure performance is fast for years and years – something you just don’t get with similarly priced Android phones.
There’s other modern internals too, like WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5. You probably don’t have a WiFi 6 router yet, but it’s here for whenever you do. 5G is the obvious miss, and if you’re after this phone for the long-term, you’ll probably wish it was included. At least the 4G speeds and reliability are excellent, as are voice calls. On the Vodafone network in the UK, I found the iPhone SE 2 actually gave me better-sounding calls than the iPhone 11. 
I have said on many occasions that I prefer FaceID to the fingerprint-based TouchID, but the latter is all that’s available here and it’s faster than ever. The already fast capacitive sensor paired with the A13 makes for an unlocking experience that might not be as slick as FaceID, but it’s a lot faster. TouchID here puts any other fingerprint unlocking system to shame, especially the still fairly poor in-display versions used frequently on Android devices.
The iPhone SE 2 looks very familiar
Camera

Photos show the power of the A13 Bionic

The iPhone SE 2 takes fantastic daylight pictures, many of which are virtually impossible to differentiate with those shot with the iPhone 11 Pro. If you’re coming from any iPhone prior to the iPhone XR, you’ll notice huge differences here, particularly around dynamic range and accuracy of the images.
The single 12-megapixel sensor with a f/1.8 lens is similar in terms of spec to the iPhone 8 (it seems, anyway), hinting that much of the improvements come directly from the A13 Bionic chipset.
Pictures in well-lit situations such as landscapes, portraits and general daytime are great, matching far pricier devices. There’s a distinct similarity to higher-end iPhones, with the same high level of detail and rich, but not too overly saturated, colours. The A13 allows for Apple’s Smart HDR features which ensure shots aren’t blown out by, say, a bright sky, and again the effect is close to that of the pricier iPhones.
The single-camera array does mean some the phone loses that hit of versatility you get either with a wider lens or one that’s zoomed in a bit further. The digital zoom is rubbish (as it is on every phone) so you only have one focal length to play with. There is a portrait mode, though, a nice addition that again uses the power of the A13 to offset the lack of a dedicated secondary sensor. This portrait mode does a good job at cutting around faces and has a soft blur effect – shame it doesn’t work on anything other than people.
 
 
I have been less impressed with the low-light performance. Up against something like the Pixel 3a (available for a similar price) the iPhone SE 2 churns out disappointingly lacklustre photos when lighting is poor. Images are noisy, lack detail and there’s no dedicated night mode to speak of. It seems that while the A13 Bionic can make this hardware perform better when shooting in daylight, it can’t work that same magic at night. Still, they do remain far better than the majority of options at this lower price.
iPhone SE 2 low light
iPhone 11 Pro Max low light

Video recording is the best, by some distance, of any phone at this pricer and superior to far pricier Android phones. It can be shot up to 4k 60fps (4k 24fps is supported too) with great detail and very steady footage. The 7MP front camera is again very good, and the portrait selfies are great.
Battery life

The iPhone SE 2 will get you through the day

Apple claims the iPhone SE 2 will last you about the same amount of time as an iPhone 8 – a phone we felt had merely average endurance. Battery life in smaller phones hasn’t come on too much since those days, and I have been able to get through a day without reaching for the charger. Just.
Of course, as this review is being written with the majority of social activities off-limits, my use of phones has changed. Hitting the iPhone SE 2 hard with long bouts of gaming does deteriorate battery fast, often very fast. But then leaving the phone unplugged overnight saw the percentage drop by 2 points – standby time is excellent again here. This certainly isn’t a phone you can hammer and expect to last into day two, and it’s nowhere near as long-lasting as the iPhone 11 Pro.
Yep, it still charges via Lightning
Apple doesn’t include a ‘fast’ charger with the iPhone 11, so it’s not surprising to see the typical 5w plug in the box. You can though use a faster charger, like the 18w plug Apple also sells. Using this I got from 0-50% in just over 30 minutes.
Wireless charging isn’t always a feature you’ll at this price, but you will find it on iPhone SE 2. 
Software

iOS 13 is here as you’d expect

iOS 13 here is like iOS 13 anywhere. Apple always does a great job at ensuring parity between all of its devices and all the big, flagship additions like dark mode is here.
Like the iPhone 11 range, there’s no 3D Touch – and Apple has removed some of the long-press support in areas like expanding notifications. Notification management remains an issue on iOS as a whole, and this makes it a little worse.
Yet it’s really services where Apple is impressing. Apple Arcade (£4.99/$4.99 after a free month) is packed with excellent titles that all run like a charm here (even if the screen isn’t ideal for gaming) and Apple TV+ (free for a year if you buy an SE) is starting to look like a worthy streaming service.
And, of course, you’ll get updates – far more updates than is usual with phones in this price range. iOS 14 is a given, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it get iOS updates for years down the line.

Should you buy the iPhone SE 2
There will be people who instantly discount the iPhone SE 2 – and that’s fine, it’s not for everyone. Yet mocking it feels downright stupid. This is a clever release by Apple as the iPhone SE 2 is a phone that a lot will love.
Not everyone has upwards of a grand to spend on a phone or huge months outlays, and even those that do might not feel the differences between this and the iPhone 11 are worth it. Here you’re getting a great camera, quality display and everything that comes with the truly unmatched iOS ecosystem for $399/£419 – that’s excellent value in anyone’s eyes.

These are the best iPhones
Everything you need to know about the Pixel 4a

You’re also getting benefits like 4K60fps recording, an IP67 rating and Qi charging – all features often left out to accommodate a more budget price.
This is a fantastic upgrade for those with an iPhone 8 or older, and you will notice big changes, and a lot of familiarities, in the switch. It’s also just a downright excellent buy if you want a phone that’ll perform fast and take excellent pictures for years to come.

Verdict




























 



Fantastic hardware meets challenged software; the P40 Pro is the best camera phone you can get for £899, and the phone’s design is beautiful. Despite some elegant software highlights too, however, the limitations when it comes to Google will likely turn many off. If Huawei can improve this in the phone’s lifetime, then the P40 Pro will be a winner. 




Pros

Class-leading camera
Good battery life
Elegant design
Great if you don't want Google



Cons

No Google Services mean, for the price, you'll probably want to look elsewhere (which is a shame)
Massive hole punch
App Gallery needs serious improvements quickly






Key Specifications

Review Price: £899
6.58-inch OLED curved display
Kirin 990, 5G
4 rear cameras, including main 50MP sensor
4200mAh battery
40w wireless and wired charging


While every smartphone maker, from OnePlus to Samsung to Sony, seems to be ramping up its flagship phone prices in 2020, Huawei’s P40 Pro costs exactly the same as the P30 Pro did, £899.
With a new camera setup that blows everything in its price bracket out of the water though (yes, including the OnePlus 8), what’s the catch? You guessed it, there’s one, and it rhymes with Moogle. 
The P40 Pro may look similar to the P30 Pro, but it’s an across-the-board improvement. It swaps out the primary camera for an even more specced out unit, clocking in at 50MP and packing a Mate 30 Pro 40MP ultra-wide-angle module. Huawei’s also updated its design, with a four-sided curve across the front and rear glass. The Pro’s power and storage have been boosted, and it even boasts the fastest potential 5G speeds of any flagship around right now. 
Despite these accolades, it also costs £899. While that isn’t cheap, it’s a lot less than many top-enders out now, with even recent entrants to the western market being significantly more brazen with their pricing – £1099 for an Oppo Find X2 Pro anyone?
This puts the Huawei P40 Pro (256GB) at exactly the same price as the OnePlus 8 Pro (256GB) and makes it significantly less expensive than the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S20 Ultra, which both cost well over £1000. 
Huawei clearly knows that, despite its rise to glory in recent years, it’s once again a challenger brand, given the fact 2019’s US-China trade wars left the tech giant without access to Google Mobile Services in its smartphones. If you’re willing to live with the sacrifices you’re getting one of the best phones around and a true best camera phone champion.
Huawei P40 Pro design – A touch of frost
One thing’s for sure, for the most part, you can’t knock the Huawei P40 Pro’s design – this is Huawei at its best.
At 6.58 inches, the Pro is neither too big, nor is it too small, sitting between the Galaxy S20 and the S20 Plus, and iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. That means, for most, it will be just about comfortable enough to manage one-handed. Despite the front glass on the P40 Pro being curved on all-sides, the screen itself isn’t too curved – nothing like the Mate 30 Pro, so accidental presses aren’t an issue. 
At 9mm thick, the P40 Pro makes the 7.9mm thin Galaxy S20 5G feel like a waif, but as we’ll come onto, that camera is worth the extra heft.
The Pro’s styling is both familiar and fresh. Its display glass, which curves pretty drastically on all four sides, is held in place by a buffed metal frame that peaks at the phone’s corners. Huawei says this adds robustness to the device, and it makes sense – more metal on the corners means if you drop it, and glass is less likely to come into contact with the ground. This frame gives the impression the screen is ‘spilling over’ and is a welcome point of differentiation. The general curviness and smoothness on all sides mean the phone nestles so comfortably in your hand and feels comfortable.

The P40 Pro’s buttons are on the right, while all the other points of interest are at the base – a mono-speaker, SIM card tray, and a USB-C port. Around the back, there’s a big ol’ camera bump. It looks better than the bump on the S20-series, with its Leica branding and landscape design – and the heft can be explained away by the P40 Pro’s zoom capabilities.
Available in five colours and two finishes, you can pick up a glossy P40 Pro in Deep Sea Blue, Ice White or Black, or in a frosted, matte, iPhone 11 Pro-esque Silver Frost, or Brush Gold. 
Huawei P40 Pro camera – Class-leading imaging for the price
The Huawei P40 Pro’s primary camera is almost identical to that of the P40, but the P40 Pro features OIS. The shared 50MP Ultra Vision sensor was impressive on its smaller sibling, and on the P40 Pro, it’s best-in-class.

An f/1.9 aperture lens with a 23mm focal length combines with large, 2.44-micron combined-pixels when taking 12MP images – that’s huge for a phone. Bigger pixels usually mean better photos, so the Pro’s off to a great start there.
With 5x optical zoom, equating to a 125mm focal length, the P40 Pro gets you a fair bit closer than the zoom on the S20 and S20 Plus. However, it can’t topple the S20 Ultra, even though the photo quality is ultimately better on Huawei’s flagship. 
There’s also a mighty 40MP ultra-wide camera with an f/1.8 aperture and an 18mm angle of view. As with the Mate 30 Pro, this doubles up as the video capture camera, so can grab super-steady footage with no cropping. Additionally, it packs autofocus, so can lock in on close-up objects like a boss. Finally, there’s a time of flight (ToF) depth sensor for better background defocus effects and more. 
Performance in poor light is impressive, as you’d expect from a Huawei phone
  
Photos captured on the primary camera are exceptional. The sensor’s 50MP resolution produces 12MP images that grab loads of detail, building on the 10MP shots older Huawei flagships capture.
Dynamic range is also excellent for the most part, though shadow boosting can be a little overzealous. Saturation and sharpening are relatively tapered compared to processing on older Huawei phones and are scaled right back when compared to snaps from the Galaxy S20-series. It leans towards warm tones, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Additionally, whatever the lighting, the P40 Pro’s camera gets excellent results in automatic mode.
The phone’s strength extends across all three cameras. The telephoto module is very comparable to Oppo’s excellent Find X2 Pro. However, when it comes to clarity, Huawei edges slightly ahead for photos, and Oppo wins out on video at a roughly 5x zoom. The S20 Ultra gets you closer to the action than both.

As for the ultrawide camera, it’s a champion with plenty of resolution, plenty of versatility thanks to its macro mode, and that 18mm focal length also gets plenty in the frame. Some smart modes get rid of elements in the shot and help with edits, but even without them, the P40 Pro’s camera is categorically the best you can get for its price, and depending what you want from your photos, the best you can get, period.
Detail is sharp and colours are great
The same can be said of the selfie camera, which also stacks up well in real-world use. Its 32MP resolution is ample, and the primary sensor is paired with a secondary depth camera for more secure face unlocking and depth effects. It also packs autofocus and shoots up to 4K front-firing video, which looks great. 
The P40 Pro’s video capture looks good across resolutions, climbing up to 4K, 60fp. Footage captured on the main camera looks stellar, is well stabilised, and any fans of more natural levels of saturation and punch would prefer Huawei’s video style to Samsung’s. 
Huawei P40 Pro screen – Smooth and curvy
Huawei’s latest flagship screen is strange but good. It’s 19.5:9 aspect ratio means it’s tall, though, with a 1200 x 2640 resolution, it sits between two industry standards – FullHD and QuadHD. Should you really care about any of that though? Not really. The main thing is, it’s bright, it’s sharp, and it looks beautifully punchy.
Unlike the main competition, the P40 Pro doesn’t feature a 120 Hz refresh rate display, instead, capping out at 90Hz. This puts Huawei in line with last year’s OnePlus phones, but still ahead of the iPhone 11 Pro.
The screen supports HDR10 content, packs OLED technology and has a 441-pixel density – sharper than the P40 or P30 Pro, less sharp than the OnePlus 8 Pro and Galaxy S20-series.

Viewing angles on the P40 Pro are excellent as is brightness, making for easy viewing indoors and out, and while we would have liked a smaller punch hole, there’s almost no bezel on this thing around the sides. Also, swiping in across the curved glass sides, top and bottom is such a treat – no harsh edges to scrape your thumb over, just rounded smoothness.
Battery life – Fast charging and a full day of use
The P40 Pro aced our battery benchmark tests, with competitive screen-on time and fast charging.
Compared to other flagship phones, Huawei’s finest performs better than the S20-range, delivering better screen on-time at comparable brightness levels. A 30-minute episode on Netflix only knocked the battery by a few per cent, and 20 minutes of gaming by a few more. We never switched from 90Hz to 60Hz screen refresh rate to save battery because we never needed to. 
With 40W charging, the P40 Pro powers up from 0-100% in about 50 minutes, though slows down charging overnight to preserve long term battery quality. That being said, half an hour of charging will top up the Pro by 80%, so if you’re in a rush in the day, are covered. Additionally, it features fast 27W wireless charging too and is the only phone we’ve seen to also offer equally fast reverse wireless charging. 
Performance and software – Fast and cool, but no Google
Powered by a Kirin 990 paired with 8GB RAM, the Huawei P40 Pro isn’t the most powerful 2020 flagship smartphone around, but it’s still incredibly capable.
Everything from gaming to multitasking, right through to photo editing was nippy. The phone’s internal storage clocks in at 256GB which is ample, and it supports Huawei’s Nano Memory cards too. 
With 5G data speeds, fast WiFi and NFC, not to mention a responsive under-display fingerprint scanner and fast face unlocking, nothing major is missing here when compared to pricier flagships. 

The Huawei P40 Pro runs Android 10, with the brand’s own interface, Emotion UI over the top. It isn’t on the same footing as other Android phones though, thanks to the US imposed Huawei Google ban. In short, Huawei phones are restricted when it comes to Google; this means no Play Store, and other limitations when using third-party apps.
The situation is improving, with Here Maps, owned by BMW now providing Huawei phones with a decent mapping service available in its AppGallery. That said, getting apps on the phone isn’t an issue, to be honest. Of course, you can use Huawei’s AppGallery, but third-party app stores are better equipped, even if they aren’t always as polished (or protected). We found everything we needed in APKMirror, including Google Maps and Chrome, which both work fine on the P40 Pro. Alternatively, you can download apps directly from the host sites – Facebook and WhatsApp make their APKs (app files) available, for example. This takes a bit of scouting around, and updates aren’t automatically managed like they are with APK Mirror or other app stores, including Aurora.   
We’re more concerned that some apps just won’t work on Huawei’s new phones. Take Uber, for example, or the Marvel Comics Unlimited App, or even Asana, a popular project management tool. None of these will work without Google Services right now – and that also includes many banking apps.
Google apps that won’t run on the P40 Pro include Docs, Drive, Gmail, the Play Store and YouTube or YouTube Studio. Additionally, Google Meet, Calendar – none of those work either, so if your business is set up as a G Suite organisation, then a new Huawei phone won’t make any sense. 
For anyone less beholden to Google, therefore, the P40 Pro’s software is really good 95% of the time once you’ve got it up and running. The camera UI, which was the main thing we used, is nippy, the core UI is smooth and stable, Huawei has supplemented Android 10 with some great multitasking features, and it’s actually easy to find apps for it. That said, you really do need to know what you’re getting into before picking one up.
Should you buy the Huawei P40 Pro?
The P40 Pro is definitely not cheap, but it’s still a great value flagship when you consider its hardware. A fantastic camera meets excellent design and a beautiful screen – it’s a robust offering for £899. Huawei’s even bundling a free Huawei Watch with it right now too; it clearly knows it needs to compete on the value front given everything going on, and that’s precisely what it’s doing.
The main reason not to recommend the P40 Pro, is, unsurprisingly its lack of Google services. Check out this review’s software section for more. Google fans or anyone bound into its ecosystem should hold off buying one – and it extends beyond Google’s own apps. 
If that doesn’t put you off though, and you want what could be the best camera phone on the market for a certain kind of user – and hands-down the best camera phone at the P40 Pro’s price, then check it out. As for anyone consciously trying to uncouple from Google’s mighty grip – the P40 Pro is the best phone you can get right now.
These are the best Android phones: from Samsung to Oppo

Verdict





























 



The Samsung Galaxy A51 is a good, solid mid-range effort. There are no major flaws, but the processor and battery weren't quite as good as we'd been expecting. 



Pros

Attractive design
Good screen
Impressive, versatile camera



Cons

Battery life could be much better






Key Specifications

Review Price: £329
6.5-inch OLED display
Exynos 9611
4/6GB RAM
4000mAh battery
48MP main camera



The Samsung Galaxy A51 is a mid-range handset from Samsung, priced at £329, which runs on the own-brand Exynos 9611 chipset and offers four rear cameras.
It’s in the same price bracket as some strong contenders including the Google Pixel 3a, so we’re hoping for a similarly impressive performance.
Design – Eye-catching and attractive, with a headphone jack
The first thing I noticed when I picked up this device for the first time is how light it is; weighing only 172g, it’s significantly less bulky than other phones of its generation, which typically clock in at around 200g. There are thin but noticeable bezels running around the screen, which is itself home to a small cutout for the selfie camera.

Everything worth knowing about the Pixel 4a


Turning it over, its rear panel also draws attention thanks to a dazzling white pearlescent finish that’s divided into geometric shapes to catch the light. The camera module in the top left is a rounded rectangle that houses four sensors plus a flash.
I’m pleased to see that the 3.5mm headphone jack remains (at a time where it’s now gone missing from both of Samsung’s flagships ranges), and the SIM tray holds two SIM cards plus a Micro SD card slot to expand the phone’s existing 128GB storage capacity.
Overall, this is an attractive, eye-catching design that’s also got all the extra functionality you’d want.
Display – An AMOLED that’s a joy to look at
The Galaxy A51 has a 6.5-inch AMOLED screen with a 1080 x 2400p resolution. It’s a good display, that being evident even upon the first start-up when its default animated wallpaper showed off a range of colours and textures to demonstrate its capabilities. On top of that, it’s always an advantage to have the much-improved contrast offered by OLED screens over their LCD counterparts.

It’s enjoyable to watch videos, browse photos or simply flick through a social media feed on this device; and what’s more, I didn’t find the notch to be intrusive as it’s tucked away at the top in the centre of the screen.
Performance – A mixed bag, but some disappointing numbers
The Samsung Galaxy A51 runs on an Exynos 9611 chipset, which is manufactured by Samsung itself and is built with 10nm architecture.
We ran it through a few benchmark tests seen in the table below (where Geekbench measures CPU performance, while 3D Mark measures the GPU).









Geekbench 5 Single-Core
Geekbench 5 Multi-Core
3D Mark Slingshot Extreme


Motorola One Hyper
502
1584
1167


Samsung Galaxy A51
348
1363
1562


Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite
717
2611
5569



As you can see, the CPU performance is significantly overshadowed by the Motorola One Hyper, which has a starting price that’s lower by £60. That’s undoubtedly a disappointment, and I would have expected better scores in these respects.
In day-to-day usage, I did notice some juddering animations when several apps were running at the same time as if the device was feeling some strain; however in my experience, games actually ran very smoothly with no noticeable lag, so in general, it was somewhat of a mixed bag.
Overall I think that you might want to feel more assured in the processing power of your phone if you’re paying a sizeable sum for a mid-range phone, especially if you want it to last you for the long-term.
Battery life – Looks good on paper, but leaves you wanting more
The Galaxy A51 has a 4000mAh battery, and this is a good size which is comparable to flagships even within Samsung’s own stable, including the Samsung Galaxy S20 itself.
However, I found that this specification flattered to deceive; I would have expected a longer-lasting performance, but instead, it left me wanting more. This perhaps points to the chipset being more inefficient than that of its rivals.
To take an example, after streaming a YouTube video for one hour, I found that the battery had drained by 6% from full. While that’s not dramatically poor, it’s not as good as some of its competitors. Over the day generally, I found the battery life to be running out sooner than I’d anticipated, and given this generous capacity, this might be down to an inefficient chip.
When it comes to topping up again, fortunately, you’ve got 15W fast-charging, which is nice and nippy, and it’s undoubtedly helpful to fall back on this if the battery doesn’t quite last as long as you’d hope.

Camera – A versatile, four lens set up
The fact that it has four camera sensors tips us off to the fact that’s it’s got a versatile camera, and fortunately, it does live up to that expectation. The cluster includes a 48-megapixel main wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor.
Samsung Galaxy A51’s main camera delivers good, detailed shots
The primary sensor delivers good, detailed shots. In the image above, you can easily pick out finer details such as rust in the foreground, while the apartment building is also clearly defined. Colours are strong but not over-enhanced (which had previously been a failing on some Samsung snappers)
Samsung Galaxy A51’s main camera captures well-defined details
With a closer shot, again the detail is a strong point; the stalks of the grapes are sharply defined, for instance, although the focus isn’t uniform on the subject.
Samsung Galaxy A51’s main camera portrait mode quickly detects faces
Portrait pictures also look good on this camera, as seen above, and the device’s software quickly detects faces.
Samsung Galaxy A51’s main camera gives a decent low light performance
Under low-light conditions, results are decent but not brilliant. Noticeable levels of detail are lost, but as in the above image, you can see into a cluster of bright lights in the mid-distance without the highlights completely overwhelming and unbalancing the picture.
Samsung Galaxy A51’s ultra-wide camera increases the field of view significantly
The ultrawide lens gives you another option to shoot with, and it certainly does increase the field of view significantly; however with this comes significant distortion around the edges (for example the stems in the right side of the above image, which appear stretched).
Samsung Galaxy A51 macro camera is good for shooting object 3-5cm away
The macro camera offers you another option if you’re shooting just 3-5cm away from the target; the snap above shows the flowers in the foreground in sharp focus, and it’s for miniature objects such as this where it comes into its own.
Overall, camera performance is good.
It’s not the very best you could get at this price – remember there’s always the Google Pixel 3a, though it has fewer sensors – but it should serve you well for the most part. The most disappointing aspect is probably the distortion in the ultrawide lens.
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy A51?
The Galaxy A51 is a phone that’s worth considering, given its decent all-round performance; its camera versatility is impressive, the screen is enjoyable to watch content on, and it looks good too, which doesn’t hurt. But if you take a look around, you’ll find devices with better processors and better cameras for the same price, so you might want to look elsewhere if those are your top priorities.

Best mid-range phones
Best budget phones

This is a respectable mid-ranger, which is good at the first things you’d look out for: camera, screen, and design are all positive points for this device. But if you scratch a little deeper, you might be a little underwhelmed by battery life and the processing capabilities.

Verdict





























 



OnePlus goes 5G. Improvements outside mobile internet aren't too dramatic, but this 5G transition is a smooth one.



Pros

5G with no massive price hike
Top-end processor
Rich, bright OLED screen



Cons

Rubbish macro camera
No optical zoom
Still missing wireless charging and an IP rating






Key Specifications

Review Price: £599.99
5G Qualcomm X55 modem
Snapdragon 865 CPU
8/12GB RAM
128/256GB storage
6.55-inch 2400 x 1080 pixel OLED screen

4300mAh battery



The OnePlus 8 is one of the first 5G phones you don’t have to pay a scary amount for. It is much less expensive than the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G from 2019, and one of the most affordable 5G phones around.
Yes, it costs £50 more than the OnePlus 7T, and the camera is arguably a downgrade. It is not perfect.
But OnePlus has done it yet again, making the right decisions to bring still-expensive 5G hardware to a £599 phone that can match several over £1000 in a few key respects.
Related: Best Android phone
Design – The OnePlus 8 looks like a high-end flagship
The OnePlus 8 is the most high-end design OnePlus has used to date for its “standard” phone.
A couple of times a year OnePlus makes a new Pro phone and a normal one, and the Pro variant usually looks and feels fancier.
This time, the two are closer. The OnePlus 8 has curved glass on the front and back just like the OnePlus 8 Pro. It is a significantly smaller phone too, but many, myself included, will find it more of a charmer as a result.
It’s easy to accidentally fire off touchscreen presses on large phones with curved sides, and micro screen surrounds. I haven’t found it a problem here, mainly if you use the supplied silicone case. It may spoil the look a little, but using it is a good idea.
Related: OnePlus 8 Pro vs OnePlus 8

There are two OnePlus 8 colours in the UK, and the one you get depends entirely on the spec you pick. The lower-end phone with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage is a glossy black. OnePlus calls it Onyx Black.
The OnePlus 8 you see here is Glacial Green, a beautiful silky matt turquoise. This finish is only available in the higher-end 256GB storage, 12GB RAM spec. It’s far more eye-catching, but also a bit more expensive, of course.
Many of the usual OnePlus design traits remain. The OnePlus 8 has a handy silent mode slider on one side, there’s no headphone jack, and while the phone is somewhat splash-proof, there is no official water resistance rating.
To get IP68, a water resistance standard that says a phone can be submerged without damage, you need to buy the OnePlus 8 Pro.
There are stereo speakers. One sits above the screen, another on the phone’s bottom. They’re loud and cut through cooking noise and the shower pretty well.
Related: Best OnePlus 8 Deals
The OnePlus 8 also has an in-screen fingerprint scanner. It’s not quite as fast as that of the Oppo Find X2 Pro but is otherwise great. It works every time as long as your thumb isn’t sopping wet, and is better than the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra’s finger pad.
The OnePlus 8’s back looks a little less recognisable than the OnePlus 7T’s, though, because it uses a standard lozenge-shape camera housing rather than the big circle of the last generation. You’re less likely to be able to spot this OnePlus from 50 paces, but you could argue this plain style is classier than either the old circle or the great big rectangles of some of the most advanced phone cameras.
I have no major complains about the 8’s outside bits, much as I still miss the older OnePlus phones’ headphone jacks.

Screen – There’s a hole, but the OnePlus 8’s screen is still impressive
OnePlus was one of the major proponents of motorised front cameras, starting with the OnePlus 7 Pro. When they arrived, I could already picture headlines of face unlock taking 10 seconds to work, and multi-million dollar recalls when the things failed three months in.
When I used one in the OnePlus 7 Pro, I was nothing but impressed. They were quick, and let you fill the whole screen with video.
OnePlus has now dumped the pop-up camera. The OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro both have punch-hole cameras. They are small, and as they sit in one corner, are a bit less distracting than one sitting in the centre of the display’s top. But they are still kind of distracting when you watch full-screen video.
All the other big-name rivals, the Samsung Galaxy S20, iPhone 11, and Oppo Find X2 Pro, have some form of punch hole or notch. This is a reversion to the norm, not OnePlus falling behind.
The sheer prevalence of punch holes also likely makes them much cheaper for OnePlus to implement than a pop-up camera.
Whether you prefer a pop-up, punch hole or notch, the OnePlus 8 screen is otherwise excellent. It’s bright enough to be clear on a sunny day, the OLED panel’s contrast is superb, and colour is excellent.

The OnePlus 8 uses a well-saturated “vivid” mode as standard. But if you head into the Settings menu, you can switch between the reserved sRGB and bolder DCI P3 colour standards. There’s even a Wide mode that pushes the colours beyond the relatively tasteful Vivid setting.
The display also supports HDR and is a 90Hz panel. This means it can refresh its image up to 90 times a second rather than the usual 60. It makes scrolling through Android look smoother. And unlike some other high refresh rate phones, the OnePlus 8 is not nerfed as standard. It uses 90Hz refresh rate and its native 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution.
An upgrade to the OnePlus 8 Pro nets you even higher resolution, 3120 x 1440 pixel resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. But in person, the difference is not all that stark. This is a great screen.
Software and performance – Similar to previous OnePlus phones, and that’s no bad thing
The OnePlus 8 runs Android 10 and the OxygenOS 10.5 interface. This is very similar to that used in the OnePlus 7T, and that’s no bad thing.
There are separate app menu and home screen areas, and the news feed home screen is Google’s. Oxygen OS’s look is its own, but it also offers a lot of significant tweaks just below the surface.
For example, you can change the shape of drop-down menu icons, switch to different icon design packs, and there’s not just a “dark” mode, but two light modes. One uses more colour than the other.
OnePlus may have taken a turn for the mainstream a couple of years ago, but the geek-friendly tweaks are still here.
The OnePlus 8 has the Snapdragon 865 CPU, the best you can get in an Android as of early-mid 2020. It’s an octa-core processor with three different flavours of Kryo core. It scores 3318 in Geekbench 5 (903 per core), beating the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. Only the iPhone 11 Pro is ahead for performance at the time of review.
Storage is ultra-fast, and the 12GB version uses the latest LPDDR5 RAM – quicker than most. But the main point is that we get the Snapdragon 865’s powerful Adreno 650 graphics processor.
OnePlus 8 vs OnePlus 8 Pro
You are more likely to smash your OnePlus 8 or drown it in an unfortunate toilet incident before games start running slow on this thing.
The OnePlus 8 is also a 5G phone, an even more important part of its techy future-proofing. Even if you buy one with no intention of upgrading to a 5G contract, the option is there. This is a phone you’ll likely be able to carry on using for years. It’s another reason to use the case and keep your OnePlus 8 looking pretty for longer.
Camera – A good mid-range camera, and decent video
Several elements of the OnePlus 8 mark a levelling-up from the OnePlus 7T, like 5G and the curved front. But the camera hardware can seem like a downgrade.
The OnePlus 7T has a 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 primary sensor, a 16-megapixel Sony IMX481 for its ultra-wide camera and a basic 2-megapixel macro with a Galaxycore GC2375 sensor.
OnePlus 8 vs OnePlus 8 Pro
There is no zoom. When you use the 2X zoom mode in the camera app, it crops into the main camera’s view. 2019’s OnePlus 7T has an optical zoom camera, one far more useful than the low-end macro used here.
These also highlight the two significant differences between this phone and the OnePlus 8 Pro. The more expensive alternative has a “real” 3x zoom and much, much better macro ability, provided by the higher-quality ultra-wide camera. Its primary camera has a better sensor too.
No surprises: while the 2MP macro can focus up close, it does not capture nearly enough detail make your shots look like stills from a nature doc. You can usually get much better results using the 2X zoom instead, which uses something close to a cropped version of the main camera’s 48-megapixel feed.
Related: Best camera phone
Night photos are also a cut below the best. While there’s an effective low-light mode called Nightscape, which helps with brightness and dynamic range, there’s a softness to night shots that wipes some fine detail and texture.
The OnePlus 8 has a good mid-range camera, not an ultra-high-end one. However, when you take it our to shoot during the day, the gap between mid-range and high-end results narrows.
This phone has nice HDR processing, and the camera feels responsive, focusing is reasonably fast. And while I miss having a great zoom, particularly as I’ve used the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and Oppo Find X2 Pro recently, the ultra-wide camera is a reasonably good one.
There’s no sudden and unmistakable drop in quality when you switch to the wide, beyond that you’d expect when stretching your field of view to 116 degrees.
The OnePlus 8 also has a Portrait mode, which blurs out the background. However, it’s pretty picky about the distance from your subject. Get too close or too far, and the blur simply won’t engage.
Here are some shots I took using the phone.


Macro mode: rubbish 
The 2x zoom isn’t great, but it is still useful for composition
Our main camera has optical stabilisation too, a feature that once seemed essential for good low-light image quality, but now isn’t thanks to the rise of night modes based on advanced computational photography. There are still a few uses for it, though.
The OnePlus 8 appears to use OIS in its Super Stable mode, part of video capture. Keep it off, and the phone uses software stabilisation right up to its top 4K 60 frames per second capture mode. This in itself is quite impressive.
But switch Super Stable on and it, judging by my observations, uses both optical and software stabilisation for even better results. In some situations, anyway. While Super Stable does significantly increase the power of judder and shake reduction, it can also cause visible tremors, particularly in lower light.
Running or BMX’ing across a field? Choose Super Stable. But for a lot of handheld situations, standard software stabilisation can do the job perfectly well.
Video quality is decent, but there isn’t quite the detail leap from 1080p to 4K you’d see from a higher-end sensor, including the OnePlus 8 Pro. Its 4K video is significantly sharper.
Battery life – Fast charging, but fast draining
The OnePlus 8 has a 4300mAh battery, and the usual super-fast charging we expect from a OnePlus phone. You get from 0 to 50% in just over 20 minutes.
My experience with battery life has been mixed. Thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, a recent and efficient chipset, charge loss while the phone is sitting in your pocket quietly listening out for notifications is minimal.
On a light day, the phone lasts to the end of the workday (say, 5:30pm) with up to 50% charge. However, the screen and modem do seem to be real battery sappers. The level drops like a stone when using the phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot outdoors, or when the ambient light level causes the OnePlus 8 to max out its display brightness.
For heavy use, there’s no real replacement for an XL-size battery, and the OnePlus 8’s is a Medium. This phone has a larger battery than the OnePlus 7T or OnePlus 7, but I don’t see a noticeable improvement over their “OK, but nothing too special” stamina.
The OnePlus 8 does not have the wireless charging of the OnePlus 8 Pro either. But the cheaper phone has to have a few cut corners somewhere.
Should you buy the OnePlus 8?
Before its launch, many were worried OnePlus would be derailed by 5G, forced to make its phones far more expensive and lose the original OnePlus appeal. The OnePlus 8 costs just slightly more than the OnePlus 7T. Crisis averted.
Already own a OnePlus 7T? You don’t need to upgrade, and the next OnePlus generation will likely have better cameras. They arguably get slightly worse this time around. However, if you want a quality phone and 5G at a sensible price, this is your best option until cheaper 5G modems appear.

After much hype, mostly from OnePlus itself, the OnePlus 8 Pro is here with one of the best screens you’ll find on an Android phone.
OnePlus phones used to set themselves apart from the Samsungs and the Apples by offering top-end specs at prices that weren’t so hard on the wallet. While that’s not so much the case anymore, the OnePlus 8 Pro is still very good value at £799 for the 8GB/128GB model and £899 for the 12GB/256GB variant.
DEAL: OnePlus 8 Pro – Save £200, now £699 at Amazon
Those prices mean this 5G phone is cheaper than the Galaxy S20 Plus (£999) and the Huawei P40 Pro (£899) while coming in at the same price as the 4G Galaxy S20.
For that price, you’re getting a lot for your money, and the OnePlus 8 Pro is a very good Android phone with a lovely display.

Screen – OnePlus 8 Pro screen is stunning, with one exception
While many phones are hyped on the strength of their camera array, the OnePlus 8 Pro feels like it’s selling itself on its display. And after using the phone for the past week, it’s not hard to see why. Technically, this is a stunning display, though whether you’ll enjoy using it is another matter.
Unlike the Galaxy S20 series, this is a 120Hz OLED display that can run at that high, very smooth refresh rate even when the screen is maxing out its quad-HD+ resolution. The smoothness, paired with the sheer sharpness all those pixels affords, makes this a glorious display. It’s seriously bright too – OnePlus claims a peak of 1300 nits and it certainly matches up to the Galaxy S20 – making it easy to use even in harsh sunlight.
Of course, there’s support for HDR 10+ though you will have to wait for apps like Netflix to support the OnePlus 8 Pro for that to work.

While some other brands, notably Samsung, have reduced the amount of screen customisations options, OnePlus phones still have plenty of ways to tweak to display to your personal preferences. You can choose between Vivid, Natural and Advanced; the latter of which lets you choose specific colour profiles like sRGB, P3 (my personal favourite) and OLED wide gamut. 
There are also a few other aspects of this display that warrant a mention, even if they certainly won’t appeal to everyone. One such feature is motion graphics smoothing, a feature you might be familiar with if you have a relatively recent high-end television. This forces content from a bunch of supported apps – Netflix, YouTube etc. – to match the 120Hz refresh rate. This is controversial on TVs for the ‘soap opera’ effect it gives, and it’s similar here: it just makes stuff look unnatural and odd. I’m also not convinced it works very well: sometimes the effect is obvious, then a second later it’ll disappear. Thankfully you can turn it off. You’ll also find a mode that turns on a faux-HDR mode to boost colours and contrast for SDR content – this is more of a success, but the results are limited.

Whether those added features work or not is beside the point, from a technical standpoint, this is a fantastic display that ticks pretty much every box I look for.
There’s an issue I have with the screen as a whole: it’s far too curved for such a large phone, making it hard to hold comfortably. I am always accidentally pressing the sides, making the phone scroll or causing random apps to open. Maybe this could be fixed if some improved accidental touch rejection is added in the software, but at the minute the best way around it is to use a case.
Samsung pretty much killed its curved screens this year, and they’re all the better for it, but with the OnePlus 8 Pro that displays feels more curved than with the 7 Pro and it’s a shame. I think that while curved screens look good, they’re just not fun to use.

Design – A minor update to the OnePlus formula
While 2019 heralded a few unique approaches to phone design, 2020 has reversed many of these decisions. The OnePlus 8 Pro ditches the clever motorised pop-up camera from its predecessor for a small cut-out camera in the corner of the screen. While this move doesn’t give you that glorious complete screen you had before, it does allow this to be the first OnePlus phone with a proper IP rating. I guess OnePlus is tired of having to field questions about why its expensive phone lacked one of the most common flagship features.
My review unit is in this ‘Glacial Green’ hue, and it’s the one interesting thing about this phone’s design. I really do love it, but then I have become enamoured with this trend of green tech. I appreciate the matte finish too, as it means you won’t have a load of grubby fingerprints covering the phone’s back. There’s a more glossy grey version available also.
Like the OnePlus 7 Pro and 7T Pro before it, the 8 is quite sharp. Due to the overly curved display, there isn’t much rim to grip on to. I’ve been using one of the OnePlus Bumper cases for most of the review period, and this really helps the phone feel a lot more pleasant to hold.

Even though OnePlus remains a relatively new company (even if they are part of BBK, a company that also owns Oppo) the fit and finish here is better than a lot of others. Everything from the USB-C port to the speaker grilles is machined with an impeccable finish. There’s no headphone jack, but that’s to be expected these days. 
Performance – One again OnePlus builds a seriously fast Android
One thing you can always count on with a OnePlus phone is that it’ll come with all the latest internals and that’s certainly the case here. There’s a Snapdragon 865 complete with the X50 modem for 5G, 8 or 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and either 128GB or 256GB storage. All the mod-cons really.
Pair that fast chipset with the 120Hz display and you’ve got a phone that’s a pleasure to use. Nothing lags; games are smooth and responsive, and the 5G support (on all models) is the icing on the cake. See below for some synthetic benchmark testing:

There are two SIM slots inside the phone, however, as usual, you will have to make do without any expandable storage. While both of these slots can be used with a 5G SIM, you can only use one of them for 5G data at a time. 5G does add cost, and without it being everywhere, yet there is always the thought that some people are paying for a feature they won’t be able to make use of. For a phone like this though, from a company that isn’t mainstream as Samsung or Apple, I think it makes sense to go 5G across the board.

5G in the UK

The in-display fingerprint sensor remains the optical kind, so it’s far quicker than the one on the Galaxy S20, but it requires a lot of light to make it work. If you unlock your phone at night, the blinding burst of blue will certainly wake you up. There’s basic facial unlocking too, which works quickly but without the secure backing of the version you’ll have on the Huawei P40 Pro.
Battery life – Another 2020 flagship that varies wildly depending on how you use it
Giving an overall verdict on battery life is becoming increasingly difficult, as these phones with high-refresh displays vary so wildly depending on how you use them and what mode you have it in.
By default, my review unit was set to 120Hz at 1080p, and that’s smart as this will be what most should use. You can, of course, see a slightly crisper image at QHD+. However, the difference is only really perceptible if you’re looking for it.
At this setting, my endurance still varied a lot, and I can put a lot of that down to slightly different usage during the ‘lockdown’. I’m streaming more music over Bluetooth, but using less mobile data on the go. With 120Hz/1080p I got between 5-6 hours of screen-on time, dial that up to QHD+ and it was more like 4-5, and even as low as three I if properly utilised that bright display for a few TV episodes on Netflix.
The 4510mAh battery isn’t small, and there’s enough capacity here to stretch things out if you want to, though losing that silky 120Hz look is hard once you get used to it.
However quickly you deplete the cell, you’ll be able to get it back very quickly. There’s the Warp Charge 30 tech here that’ll give you 50% in around 20-25 minutes and a full charge in a bit over an hour. There’s also wireless charging at 30w if you’ve got one of the new OnePlus wireless chargers. 

This will set you back £69, but it does charge at a similar rate to the wired option. It’s a nice looking charger too, with a sturdy body and vertical orientation. One annoying aspect is that the charging coils are too high up to charge certain Qi accessories, like AirPods.
A full charge on a regular wireless charger takes about 4 hours, which is pretty much standard these days.
Camera – Not the priority, but still gets the job done
I have been quite impressed with the camera on the OnePlus 8 Pro. It edges on the punchier, more saturated, side of images with skies looking particularly blue, but this does lead to pleasing shots that are captured quickly.

On the back you’ll find a main 48-megapixel sensor, which is the Sony IMX689, with an f/1.8 lens and OIS. This is paired with a second 48-megapixel sensor, this time for ultra-wide shots. While most phones seem to have that high megapixel secondary camera focussed on zoom, this OnePlus uses it for ultra-wide snaps instead, and these can look really good.
There is a zoom lens too, in the form of an 8-megapixel camera with OIS. There’s no form of periscope zooming though, a feature you’ll find on recent flagships like the Galaxy S20 Ultra, Oppo Find X2 Pro and Huawei P40 Pro. As a result, zoomed shots are ok if you’re jumping 3x; push it further though, and the snaps deteriorate quickly.
I’ve been a big fan of these recent zoom lenses on phones as it gives them a completely new use case that wasn’t available before. It’s a shame it’s missing here, though hardly a surprise as OnePlus has never been up there with the best when it comes to camera quality or tech.
But, of course, OnePlus still wants to be able to call this a ‘quad-camera’ phone, so it’s added a very odd 5-megapixel colour filter sensor on the back too. This takes snaps with chromatic colours that give them a look I do not like at all. Take a picture of some trees, and it makes everything look dead, almost like you’re wandering through a post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s pure gimmick and goes against the idea OnePlus has pushed for years that it doesn’t just add features for the sake of it. As it’s only 5-megapixels the pictures also lack sharpness, with textures coming across quite muddy.
There’s enough quality in the ultra wide camera
Sharpness and detail isn’t an issue with the other cameras though, especially the two 48-megapixel sensors. Both of these can either take 12-megapixels shots (combining multiple pixels into one) or pure 48-megapixel shots. Sometimes shots can look a bit too oversharpened, especially if you’re shooting trees or flowers, but that’s a minor issue, and it actually makes for a more pleasing image when you’re looking at it through the phone’s screen.
The 8 Pro has a better, newer sensor than the OnePlus 8 and the difference does show. 4K (up to 60fps is supported) video shot on the Pro is a lot sharper and smoother, while low-light snaps retain more detail and don’t rely so much on brightness.
Pictures do lack the strong dynamic range of the recent Galaxy S20 phones and the Pixel 4, meaning shots with a lot of variation in colour aren’t as striking.
Colours are bright, even if it can make particularly sunny scenes a little unnatural
Zooming up to 3x is good, if not as strong as the pricier competition

Software – OnePlus Android remains the best Android
Google’s version of Android is often heralded as the finest form of the software. Yet the version you’ll find on a OnePlus device (OxygenOS 10.5) is just as good. It’s packed with nice customisations, yet it keeps a look that’s very similar to what you’ll find on a Google Pixel.
OnePlus has even slimmed down its additions to Android this time, removing the relatively useless Shelf and replacing it with Google’s own Discover panel – which might be equally useless depending on how you use it.

I like so many of the tweaks here, from altering the accent colours to turning certain apps greyscale to make them better on your eyes when reading. OnePlus knows when to add, and when to just leave stuff alone. For example, it knows Google’s own apps (Calendar, Mail etc.) are much better than ones it could make itself – so it doesn’t try. Samsung could learn a lesson here, as pick up an S20 device and you’ll find it jammed with apps that you’ll likely never use.
Should you buy the OnePlus 8 Pro?
The OnePlus 8 Pro doesn’t feel like a huge update over its predecessor, and I do hope the brand ditches its ‘T’ line this year and keeps this as the main phone until the OnePlus 9. Or focus on a different market, as Samsung does with its Note series.
While the overall update isn’t huge, this is an excellent Android phone with one of my favourite displays out there, software that might just be better than Googles and a very respectable camera. The addition of highly-requested features like Qi charging and an IP rating is also welcome, especially as OnePlus has held out against adding them for so long.

These are the best Android phones
Want an iPhone? We’ve rounded up the best iPhones
And these are the best camera phones

To some, the OnePlus 8 Pro might lack that high-end standout feature. There isn’t anything here you can’t get elsewhere and OnePlus has decided against implementing things like impressive zoom. Yet it still remains cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and Oppo’s Find X2 Pro by quite a large amount, and it makes this a perfect choice for someone who doesn’t want to blow £1000 on a phone.
I wish it was smaller; ditched the curved screen and was a little more comfortable to hold. But this still remains a great, big Android phone.

Verdict




























 



If you've got a budget of around £200 then this a great choice, it's good across the board, with an excellent battery, and a good screen. The camera is decent and very versatile, while performance matches that of other phones in the same price bracket.



Pros

Massive battery
Reasonable price
Good camera



Cons

Unremarkable design
Takes a while to charge






Key Specifications

Review Price: £219
155.95 x 75.84 x 9.63mm

6.4-inch Full HD+ display

The Moto G8 Power has been given the “Power” moniker due to its fearsome 5000mAh battery capacity, but does this lower mid-range device have the full package or is it a one-trick pony? 
In this review we put the Motorola G8 Power through its paces, to see if the screen, the processor, and the quadruple-camera set-up are just as impressive.
Design and Screen

Relatively large device with a 6.4-inch screen
Very much a fingerprint magnet
Not the sharpest display, but still more than adequate for the price

The Moto G8 Power is a relatively large device with a 6.4-inch screen that features a small “punch-hole” notch in the top left corner, housing a selfie camera.
Its back panel has a slight ribbed effect visible just below the surface, which has a smooth glossy finish that unfortunately acts as a fingerprint magnet. Also on the rear side, you’ll find the four camera sensors plus the flash, along with an M-branded fingerprint scanner.
Motorola G8 Power’s rear
Functionally, it has Micro SD card storage that expands the original storage by up to 512GB and there’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack.
Overall it has a businesslike appearance that won’t exactly divide opinion, but it’s unlikely to turn heads either.
The Moto G8 Power screen measures 6.4-inches, and it’s got a 1080  x 2400p resolution, which is nice and crisp so that text and images are not pixellated.
Web browsing on the Motorola G8 Power
As with many (though not all) phones at this price point, it does have an LCD display. LCD lacks the contrast of an AMOLED and doesn’t have HDR support either, so colours don’t “pop” out of the screen in the same pleasing manner as AMOLED counterparts. These factors could mean that it would come as a downgrade if you’re used to a higher quality screen, but it still stacks up well against its rivals at this price point.
If you want to find that fully immersive experience for watching videos and playing games, then you would probably have to spend quite a bit more money, but otherwise, this display should serve you well.
Performance

Powering the phone is a Snapdragon 665
Benchmark scores are good for the price

The Motorola G8 Power has a Snapdragon 665 chipset, which is a modest mid-range chip rather than being a world-beating powerhouse.
When performing undemanding tasks such as messaging or social media I had no problems at all, but when running more demanding games you can sense this processor’s deficiencies – the experience is a little jerky, making it less enjoyable and potentially less competitive.
Motorola has also introduced a feature called “Moto GameTime” to this year’s G8 series. Intended to boost performance and allow you to adjust settings and notifications to minimise distractions, when I used this feature my game crashed – and let me tell you, that doesn’t exactly make things more convenient.
We also put the Moto G8 Power through benchmarking tests to see how it fairs in comparison to similarly-priced devices:








 
Geekbench 5 Single-Core
Geekbench 5 Multi-Core
3D Mark Slingshot Extreme


Motorola G8 Power
312
1361
1110


Motorola One Hyper
502
1584
1167


Xiaomi Mi A3
307
1269
1137



It has scores typical for its price, but that does mean that it’s not ideal for gaming. If you use your phone for less demanding tasks, it should still hold up well, but if gaming is a priority, then you might want to look for an alternative that packs more of a punch.
Battery life

5000mAh battery paired with HD+ screen is great for endurance
Fairly slow to charge

The Motorola G8 Power boasts a massive 5000mAh battery; that’s bigger than several big-name flagship devices, including the Huawei P40 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. It’s likely to be one of the key selling points of the phone for anyone browsing the specs listings, but how does it perform in real-world testing?
Fortunately, the G8 Power does a great job lasting through a long day of heavy usage. To take one example, it was reduced from full charge to 97% after one hour of streaming YouTube videos over WiFi. This device should easily last you through one day and well into the next, even if you use it heavily.
However, there is one caveat to the battery performance: its charging speeds aren’t quite so impressive, as this device doesn’t boast the fast-charging tech that does exist for some other phones of similar prices.

As you can see from the table above, the G8 Power took two hours to charge from 20% to full, which isn’t speedy by anyone’s standards. You might be best off leaving it to charge overnight. At least with such a big battery, it’s unlikely to be very run down by the end of the day.
Camera

Four rear cameras
These include a 16MP main, 8MP zoom and 2MP depth
You’ll generally get pleasing pictures

While it’s never going to challenge the best camera phones around, the snappers here are capable.
The Motorola G8 Power has a total of four rear cameras: a 16-megapixel main camera, an 8-megapixel telephoto lens, an 8-megapixel ultrawide lens, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor.
Motorola G8 Power’s main camera takes decent shots
The main camera generally takes pleasing pictures such as the one above. Colours are naturalistic and accurate rather than overblown, and detail is decent though not great. However, you can see that not all the fruit is in sharp focus in this image.
Motorola G8 Power’s main camera captures a spectrum of colours in detail
This shot again captures a spectrum of colours in a fair amount of detail that allows you to read most of the finer text on the bottles.
Motorola G8 Power’s main camera struggles in low-light
But when shooting in lower light conditions, the flaws are exaggerated, with bright lights blown out and a significant amount of detail is lost. The device doesn’t perform exceptionally well at all at night either, but that’s fairly typical of camera phones around this price point.
Motorola G8 Power’s ultra-wide lens is a nice addition
The ultrawide camera gives you the option to have a larger frame, and it’s by no means a huge step down from the main camera, but a good choice to have when you want to squeeze more into the frame. Although as with many examples of this kind of lens, there’s some noticeable “stretching” distortion in the image.
Motorola G8 Powers portrait mode isn’t quite as good
The telephoto lens is used for portrait photos, working in combination with the depth sensor for a “bokeh” effect. It seems like this lens isn’t quite as good as the previous two; detail isn’t picked out as readily on the subject, and the bokeh effect doesn’t help your subjects to stand out of the image in the way it does on the very best camera phones.
Motorola G8 Power’s macro camera does a good job
There’s also a macro camera thrown into the mix for even more versatility. Frankly, I would rarely find the opportunity to use this snapper, which specialises in extreme close-ups just centimetres away from the lens; however, it did a great job in capturing the action figure in the image above which only measures approximately 2.5-inches.
Motorola G8 Power’s 16-megapixel selfie camera delivered good results
The selfie camera has a 16-megapixel resolution, matching that of the main rear camera. It delivered a good performance in general. For the bokeh effect, it relies on software rather than an accompanying depth sensor; while the result is more striking (as seen above), it doesn’t distinguish completely cleanly between the subject and the background, with a couple of blurred edges found in the hair.
Despite a couple of shortcomings, this is still a good, versatile set of cameras for the price; you’re unlikely to find a much better all-round package for the same price.
You should buy it if…
You want an exceptional battery life
The Power series is known for its class–leading battery life and that’s very much the case here thanks to a 5000mAh cell. If you only care about longevity, maybe for trips away or festivals, then it’s certainly worth taking a look at this. 
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want a really sharp display
With a 720p resolution stretched out over a 6.4-inch panel this is far from the sharpest phone at this price point and you’ll notice this when watching media or scrolling through photos.

The vanilla Huawei P40 undercuts the Samsung Galaxy S20, despite packing more megapixels and a mightier zoom. With no wireless charging and a lower refresh rate screen though, have too many compromises been made to hit its £699 price?
£699 is something of a no man’s land when it comes to smartphone prices. It isn’t quite a flagship cost with the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S20 Ultra costing well over £1000, but neither is it an upper-midrange price, like the £499 Realme X2 Pro or Samsung Galaxy A-series phones. 
It’s a new niche of ‘affordable flagship’, and it’s likely where many cost-conscious tech fans pining after flagship features will settle when buying a smartphone during these financially challenging times.

Hands-on: Huawei P40 Pro review


When we first saw its specs, the P40 felt like an instant compromise alongside the P40 Pro – less zoom, smaller, inferior screen, more traditional design and no wireless charging. But, actually, after over a week with it (and specifically its camera), it offers something different, and is a decent bit of tech in its own right, especially for anyone after a smaller smartphone footprint.
Like the P40 Pro, the P40’s albatross is its lack of Google Play Services, which continue to hurt Huawei’s Android devices. That said, if you can get past that, you won’t find a better camera than the P40 for the price. 
Design – A mini, mighty unit
There’s something to be said for small phones with flat screens, and the Huawei P40 checks both boxes.
At 6.1-inches, it’s easy enough to manage one-handed, and the lack of curves means accidental presses aren’t an issue. That said, the phone is also a unit – well built, dense and could do some damage if dropped on a toe – trust us.

At 8.5mm thick, the P40 makes the 7.9mm thin Galaxy S20 5G feel very sleight, also owing to its weight – 175g vs the S20 5G’s 163g.
The curved glass back and buffed metal frame feel great, while the flat screen is low on bezels, but big on punch hole cameras, with a pill-shaped dual selfie camera in the top left. 
The P40’s buttons are on the right, while all the other points of interest are at the base – a mono-speaker, SIM card tray, and a USB-C port. You can pick it up in three colours – Deep Sea Blue, Ice White and Black – with all packing a fingerprint-loving gloss finish. 
Huawei P40 camera – Class-leading imaging for the price
The Huawei P40’s primary camera is almost identical to that of the P40 Pro, save for three letters – OIS. It features the same 50MP Ultra Vision camera with an f/1.9 aperture and a 23mm focal length, but the image stabilisation is electronic, Huawei terms it AIS. 

OIS is, however, found on the P40’s telephoto camera which delivers a 3x optical zoom, equating to an 80mm focal length, and there’s also a 16MP ultra-wide camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a 17mm angle of view.
We’ll get this out of the way – all three cameras deliver more detail and arguably better results when shooting stills than the Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus. That’s a pretty huge deal considering the P40’s price. 

Photos captured on the main camera are exceptional. The sensor’s 50MP resolution produces 12MP images that grab loads of detail, building on the 10MP shots older Huawei phones, including the P40 and Mate 30 Pro captured. 
Dynamic range is also excellent for the most part, though shadow boosting can be a little overzealous at times. Saturation and sharpening are relatively tapered compared to processing on older Huawei phones and are scaled right back when set aside snaps from the Galaxy S20 series.
  
The phone’s strength extends across all three cameras. Its telephoto camera outperforms the OnePlus 7T Pro, S20 and S20 Plus, but falls behind the Oppo Find X2 Pro, S20 Ultra and, of course, the P40 Pro. We can’t state this enough though, for the price, it’s the best you can get when it comes to Android cameras. 
As for the ultra-wide camera, it isn’t quite as wide as some but fits the bill when it comes to detail. Thanks to the fact it features autofocus combined with a macro mode, it’s more versatile than that of the iPhone 11 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S20. 
5x zoom
Some smart modes get rid of elements in shot and help with edits, but even without them, the P40’s camera will still be head and shoulders above the £699 Android competition.
The same can be said of the selfie camera, which also stacks up well in real-world use. Its 32MP resolution is ample, and the primary sensor is paired with a secondary IR camera for more secure face unlocking. It also shoots up to 4K front-firing video, which looks great. 
Speaking of video, this is one area the P40 does well, but the S20 series does slightly better, with its snappier focusing. Footage captured on the main camera looks stellar, is well stabilised, and any fans of more natural levels of saturation and punch would prefer Huawei’s video style to Samsung’s. 
As for resolution, the P40’s video is shot at up to 4K at 60fps. That isn’t the 8K of the S20, but that isn’t something we’re missing at this stage. 
Screen – Good enough though we’d have loved 90Hz
Spec-obsessed tech fans will call the P40 screen substandard, and, compared to phones like the S20 (£799 for the non-5G version) and OnePlus 7T Pro (£699), it trails behind.
Unlike the competition, the P40 doesn’t feature a high refresh rate display, instead, capping out at 60Hz. It also loses out on the accreditations other displays so proudly tout – there’s no official HDR badge here, though you do get a perfectly respectable OLED panel with FHD+ 2340 x 1080 resolution.
Viewing angles are excellent, brightness is good indoors and out, and while we would have liked a smaller punch hole and a higher refresh rate – either 90Hz or 120Hz, the P40’s screen nevertheless does a decent job day-to-day.
Huawei P40 battery life – Fantastic screen-on time and decent real-world results
It’s challenging to test a smartphone to its fullest when you’re self-isolating, so while our real-world use case wasn’t too demanding, the P40 aced our battery benchmark tests. Particularly, it delivered amongst the most impressive screen-on time we’ve seen to date, with a 90-minute video depleting it by around 7% at full brightness.
Practically speaking, light users should be able to get two days out of it, and moderate to heavy users will unlikely struggle to go from morning to night on a single charge, unless you’re 5G downloading and Netflix watching all day. 
The phone doesn’t charge as quickly as the P40 Pro, which powers up at 40W charging rates. Instead, the P40 charges at 22.5W, making it from 0 to 100% in just over an hour. Additionally, it doesn’t feature wireless charging. 
Performance – Fast enough
Powered by a Kirin 990 paired with 8GB RAM, the Huawei P40 isn’t the most powerful £699 smartphone, but it’s plenty powerful nonetheless, and this is reflected in day-to-day performance.

Whether gaming, UI swiping or photo editing, we didn’t find ourselves waiting for anything. The phone’s internal storage is either 128GB or 256GB, and it supports Huawei’s Nano Memory cards too.
With 5G data speeds – not a given at the price, fast WiFi and NFC, not to mention a responsive under-display fingerprint scanner and fast face unlock, nothing major is missing here when compared to pricier flagships. 
Huawei P40 Software – How much of a problem is no Google?
Huawei’s software story is a mixed bag right now. It’s better than it once was – when the Mate 30 Pro launched, the AppGallery was anaemic at best. Now, it’s fleshing out nicely. 
Once we were concerned about how you’d get apps onto a Huawei phone, now we’re more concerned that some apps just won’t work on one. Take Uber, for example, or the Marvel Comics Unlimited App, or even Asana, a popular project management tool. None of these will work without Google Services, which is missing from Huawei phones – here’s the Huawei trade ban backstory in case you missed it.

The Google apps that won’t run include Docs, Drive, Gmail, the Play Store and YouTube or YouTube Studio. Additionally, Google Meet won’t run, nor will Hangouts, so if your business is set up as a G Suite organisation, then a new Huawei phone won’t make sense. 
That said, there are some surprise wins too. Google Maps, Translate, and Chrome all work great – albeit without linking to your Google account. Considering there’s currently no mapping solution available natively, it’s a very good job Google Maps works.
For anyone less beholden to Google, therefore, the P40’s software is excellent 95% of the time. The camera UI, which was the main thing we used is nippy, the core UI is smooth and stable, Huawei has supplemented Android 10 with some great multi-tasking features, and it’s easy to find apps for it. 
To get apps onboard the P40 or P40 Pro, you can use Huawei’s AppGallery, a third-party app store, including APKMirror, or you can download them directly from the host site – Facebook and WhatsApp make their APKs available, for example. This takes a bit of scouting around but isn’t too arduous.  
Should you buy the Huawei P40?
The P40 is a great affordable flagship phone in most respects. It has the best camera available at its price, outperforming the pricier iPhone 11 when it comes to versatility in particular, and its hardware and software come together better than we expected them to. 
It also undercuts the Samsung Galaxy S20 5G by £200, and the vanilla S20 by £100, despite delivering superior imaging clout. That said, with no wireless charging or 90/120Hz displays, sacrifices have been made.

Care about photos? These are the best camera phones
And these are the best Android phones around right now

The main reason not to recommend the P40, is, unsurprisingly its lack of Google services. Check out this review’s software section for more, but Google fans or anyone bound into its ecosystem will want to avoid the P40 as a result. 
If none of that puts you off though, pick one up, by all means. After all, the P40 could be the perfect affordable flagship for anyone trying to consciously uncouple themselves from Google’s mighty grip.

Verdict



































The Galaxy S20 Plus is the middle child in Samsung’s latest flagship phone lineup, but make no mistake, it’s still an absolute beast of a phone.
For your hard-earned cash, you’ll be treated to a stellar display, typical Samsung design and pretty much all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a flagship smartphone. So, if you’re after an Android flagship, the Galaxy S20 Plus is one of the best options you’ll get at the moment.
Or, at least it was until the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus and S21 Ultra launched this year. You can read our reviews of all the new phones now.
The only downsides of the S20 Plus are the use of a slightly less efficient Exynos CPU outside of the US plus a few niggling annoyances with Samsung’s software – which even Google’s taken an exception to in recent years.
Design and Screen

120Hz OLED display is excellent
1440p resolution and HDR support
More compact than the Ultra

The Galaxy S20 Plus features a near-identical design to the regular Galaxy S20, the only obvious differences being its slightly larger dimensions and the fact it comes with 5G as standard – which is the biggest contributor to its higher price tag.
If like us, you’re fans of Samsung’s recent phone designs this is no bad thing and the Plus will instantly feel familiar and at home in your hand. For your money, you’ll be treated to a super premium mixed metal and glass phone with a close to unnoticeable all-screen front and slightly curved sides.
This, plus its sensible 6.7-inch form factor make it wonderfully comfortable to hold and hit what I would describe as the sweet spot for phone sizes. It’s large enough to watch movies, game and read books on, without feeling cumbersome – which is a key issue we had with the larger, Galaxy S20 Ultra.
I am also a big fan of Samsung’s decision to put the hole-punch front camera housing in the top middle of the phone’s screen, like the one seen in the Galaxy Note 10. While I am still not a huge fan of hole punch notches the central placement feels far less intrusive than the side placement seen on the Galaxy S10, which puts it where your thumb naturally sits when holding the phone landscape.

Read our Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra review


The only feature I’m not completely set on is the rear camera housing, which has a distinct Pixel 4 look. Though it houses four well-specced sensors and is technically a very impressive bit of engineering, the housing noticeably protrudes from the phone’s back and makes you feel like it’s been designed to sit in a case – something Samsung annoyingly doesn’t provide in the box.
This is doubly troublesome as we’d really recommend that any buyer pick up a case the moment they buy any S20 handset. Though the naked glass design looks beautiful and is wonderfully well made, as the number of cracked Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S10s you’ll spot in the wild attest, glass-backed phones will break when met with even moderate force if left unprotected.
The in-built fingerprint scanner is a final minor annoyance. The scanner is baked into the screen and, while it generally works fine, it feels noticeably less responsive than key competitors’ like the OnePlus 7T Pro, which has similar tech. Thankfully the face unlock is accurate enough that I never had to rely on the sensor too much, however.

Samsung Super AMOLED displays have a reputation for being best in class. For the most part, this remains the case with the Galaxy S20 Plus, which comes loaded with a 6.7-inch, high refresh rate Super AMOLED panel.
Though it’s smaller than the Ultra’s equivalent screen, it has the same QHD+ max resolution and 120Hz top refresh rate. The 120Hz refresh rate is a key selling point that’s being pitched at gamers. It lets the screen display way more images per second than the older S10, which had a 60Hz refresh rate.
This can, when coupled with a high polling rate, offer gamers a competitive advantage reducing the delay between them enacting command and it rendering on screen. It’ll also make the screen generally smoother to use when doing basic things like scrolling. We’ve seen the trick work to great effect in handsets like the OnePlus 7T family, which feature slightly slower 90Hz panels.
The only downside is how the increased refresh rate drains the battery significantly faster. This is why Samsung’s locked the screen to only display in 1080p resolutions when running in 120Hz. This sounds like a big limiter, but honestly, with real-world use I didn’t mind the compromise, feeling the screen uniformly was still sharp enough.
Colours and brightness levels are also uniformly excellent. Though I found the out of the box vivid setting a little warm for my liking, you’ll struggle to get a prettier looking display on a phone. Movies look brilliant and are uniformly atmospheric thanks to the screen’s HDR support and stellar contrast.
My only quibble is that switching the refresh rate is a bit of a faff and I’d really like to see some form of automation applied, like what happens on gaming monitors. There’s no point having a screen run at 120Hz when you’re watching video content that’s mastered at a lower refresh rate.
We’ve also seen that making a screen truly variable and able to drop below 60Hz can seriously improve battery life thanks to the Apple Watch 5 – which can drop to run a 1Hz when it’s just displaying the time.

Performance

Exynos or Snapdragon chipsets depending on where you live
5G support on all models
Samsung’s One UI overlay over the top of Android

Under the hood, the Plus is an absolute beast of a best phone, regardless of which CPU option you get – like all Samsung phones the US version of the S20 Plus uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon, not Exynos chip.
The Exynos version I tested blitzed through every task I threw at it hassle-free and without any overheating issues, which has been a problem on past phones I’ve tested running Samsung chips.
Playing a marathon-length PUBG game the S20 Plus ran at 120Hz with zero issues or sign of CPU throttling. The 12GB of RAM is also complete overkill and lets the handset run multiple processes with zero delay or noticeable slowdowns.
The only feature I found could give it pause was 8K video recording. Setting the handset to constantly capture 8K footage at 30fps the back of the handset did begin to heat up and battery drain was terrible, but that’s to be expected.
I’d also have liked to see the 512GB version sell in the UK, though the inclusion of a microSD slot means the regular 128GB model should be more than good enough for most people.
The Galaxy S20 Plus’ synthetic benchmark scores mirrored my real-world findings. You can see how it’s benchmarks compared to key rivals’ in the table below.

Camera

Three cameras on the back. Including a 12MP main sensor
You also get a 12MP ultra wide
And finally a 48MP camera for zooming

The Plus’ camera setup is the only area to have serious cuts compared to Samsung’s top dog Ultra model.
The Plus comes with three main camera sensors. Specifically, it features a 12-megapixel f/1.8 main, a 12-megapixel ultra-wide, and 64-megapixel telephoto lens. Unlike the regular S20, it also comes with a DepthVision camera for 3D sensing that’s designed to help improve things like Live Focus and AR accuracy.
The Ultra, by comparison, features a 108-megapixel, f/1.8 OIS main, 12-megapixel ultra-wide and a 48-megapixel telephoto triple sensor setup.
The differing set up between the two means the S20 Plus doesn’t feature the Ultra’s headline-grabbing 100x ‘Space Zoom’, which on paper will be an annoyance for people that like to take snaps at live events like gigs and sports fixtures.
Instead, you can 3x Hybrid Optic zoom and 30x ‘Super Resolution’ zoom. The truth is that despite the compromise we couldn’t take decent snaps beyond 10x zoomed on either, though quality remained slightly better on the Ultra.
Zooming aside, the Galaxy S20’s camera is actually still very capable and a clear step up on Samsung’s previous S10 Plus.
Shooting in regular light it’s immediately obvious Samsung’s listened to user feedback and dialled back the amount of image processing the phone does. This gives photos a much more realistic look than past Samsung phones. Colour and contrast are particularly improved, though sharpening has also been reduced.
The Plus is free of the focussing issues we found playing the Ultra. Unlike it’s beefier sibling the auto-focus uniformly found its mark outside of very difficult shooting conditions, like mixed lighting.
Portrait shots are nicely detailed and free of the aberrations that creep into some competing phones. Generally, the camera managed to produce usable bokeh effects, where the background is slightly blurred while the subject is in focus.
The only issue is that, despite the stellar work Samsung’s done elsewhere, the portrait mode still has a tendency to over smooth people’s faces and skin, giving them an odd, Thunderbird-puppet-like, look on occasion.
Low light performance has been noticeably improved on the S10-line. While I’m not convinced it’s as good as best camera phones like the Pixel 4, or Huawei P30 Pro, photos taken in low light are significantly better than those taken on the S10 Plus.
They’re less noisy, feature better contrast and generally look more realistic. I also found, on occasion, they could match, if not beat the Ultra’s performance in dim conditions, which is surprising given the latter’s use of clever pixel-binning tech.
8K video recording is the only camera feature I’m not completely sold on. The mode works, but the 30fps capture cap makes the footage look significantly choppier than the 4K and 1080p record options. This, plus the heating issues and fact there aren’t a lot of cases for capturing in 8K, particularly on a phone, makes it feel a little pointless.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the Galaxy S20 Plus below.
    
Battery life

Inside there’s a 4500mAh battery
A full recharge should take around 90 minutes
Charger in the box

Battery life has always been a tricky area for the Exynos variants of Galaxy phones. Which is why with the added workload of 5G connectivity and a 120Hz screen I went into this review with serious concerns about the Galaxy S20’s battery life.
With real-world testing, I got a similar experience to what our reviewer got using the S20 Ultra. This means battery life will vary massively depending on how you use the phone.
With the screen set to 60Hz and a QHD+ resolution, I get decent battery life out of the S20 Plus. Using it as my main work and personal phone with an active 5G SIM, it generally lasted about a day to a day and a half before needing a top-up charge. Streaming video in this setting it discharged 6-10% of its charge per hour, which is pretty par for the course on a flagship at the moment.
This is also taking into account the fact that, outside of a dedicated trip to Kings Cross station to test it, the phone spent the majority of its time running in 4G. 5G is still a rarity outside of select very specific areas in the UK.
Jumping to 120Hz battery life drops, however. Running at 120Hz, even with the resolution drop, I found myself reaching for the charger before the end of the day, even with moderate use. Moderate use entailed listening to music during my morning workout and commute, regularly checking incoming messages and my social media feeds, a couple of hours Netflix streaming and a game of PUBG before bed.
Thankfully, charging the S20 Plus is quick and easy thanks to the inclusion of 25W and Qi (15W) wireless support. Charging the 4500mAh battery took around an hour and a half using the supplied charger.
Software
The only final issue I have with the S20 Plus is the same one I’ve had with pretty much every Samsung phone for the last decade – its use of a custom Android skin. Being fair to Samsung, it has done great work cleaning up its software from the bad old days of Touchwiz.
There are less duplicate apps and bloatware present than ever before. But I still hate the custom icons Samsung uses and can’t help but think most the menu system changes are completely pointless, or outright harmful to the user experience. Bixby is also a poor alternative to Google’s own Assistant that quite frankly needs to get into the sea – thankfully it’s very easy to remove and disable most encounters with Samsung’s virtual assistant.
This would be forgivable were it not for the fact the changes radically change Android, to the point even Google’s allegedly told Samsung to stop messing with it. This means it will likely take a lot more time and effort for the new Galaxy phones to be upgraded to future versions of Android.

You should buy it if…
Want a high-res 120Hz display
Samsung ditched the 1440p resolution with the 2021 Samsung Galaxy S21, meaning if you don’t want the Ultra you’d have to settle for 1080p.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want the best flagship camera
Samsung couldn’t quite beat some of the best competition in the smartphone camera space with the S20. It’s good, just not fantastic.

The Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite was a surprise when it launched, and we’re still scratching our heads trying to make sense of it.
Arriving on the scene almost a full year after the mainline Samsung Galaxy S10 series and only around one month before the Samsung Galaxy S20 series was announced, it seemed an unusual tactic.
Frankly, it doesn’t bear a strong relation to either of these flagship series, and should instead be considered in its own right as a competitor to some of the best mid-range phones like the Xiaomi Mi 9 or the OnePlus 7T.
The Galaxy S10 Lite boasts a triple camera led by a 48-megapixel sensor, a 6.7-inch screen, a Snapdragon 855 processor, and a 4500mAh battery. These are seemingly strong specifications, but does it have the overall performance to match?
Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite – Design
Immediately catching the eye, the Galaxy S10 Lite has a smooth, pearlescent sheen across the back panel which reflects the light for an attractive and noticeable finish. There’s a black rectangular camera module in the upper left hand corner for contrast (similar to the Samsung Galaxy S20), while the cool metallic sides provide a premium feel.
The screen is large, measuring 6.7-inches, with a minimal bezel around the sides and a small hole-punch cut-out at the top for the selfie camera. Though both the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus have curving displays, the S10 Lite’s display is flat. The speaker is housed at the base of the phone. There’s no headphone jack, but there is a slot for a MicroSD card.
Overall, it’s an attractive design with a touch of class that does belong with its true flagship cousins – if you were to just look at it, it’s not at all obvious that this is a ‘Lite’ version rather than a premium phone.

Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite – Screen
The Galaxy S10 Lite’s AMOLED screen measures 6.7-inches with a 1080 x 2400 resolution, which ensures that it’s clear to read, although it’s not super sharp and the colours never really ‘pop’ out of the screen in the same way as the best on the market. The display is capable of very high brightness levels, although it does lack the enhanced refresh rates recently adopted by some flagships.
There’s a small hole-punch at the top of the screen that houses a 32-megapixel selfie camera, and surely some users will object to this interruption in the display, but I didn’t find it to be intrusive in the screen, even when watching a feature-length film.
Overall I was satisfied watching content on the screen though it certainly doesn’t rank among the best screens you can get. Playing games was particularly enjoyable, as the large screen was immersive, and it was comfortable to hold in landscape orientation. The display might not be stunning in itself, but it certainly does the job.
Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite – Performance
The Galaxy S10 Lite runs on a Snapdragon 855 processor, a chipset that powered many of 2019’s best phones. At launch it was the best Qualcomm could offer – but it’s since been surpassed by both the 855 Plus and the new 865. Nonetheless, it’s still a very powerful processor.
In our benchmarking tests, the results of which are below, it goes toe-to-toe with an all-out flagship, the Huawei Mate 30 Pro.

Everyday tasks where accomplished with ease, and I did not experience any stuttering or sudden app shutdowns. Games also ran very smoothly on high settings. This device should deal with pretty much anything you throw at it.

Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite – Software and features
The base software here is Android 10, with OneUI 2.0 overlaid. I liked this interface, which is intuitive and features large, clear icons. It still does have quite a few pre-installed apps, but unlike some rival brands around this price, you can at least hide them away in the app drawer.
As already mentioned, there’s no headphone jack on this smartphone – and unfortunately Samsung has bundled in a really cheap set of USB-C earphones that offer horrendously tinny audio playback. Hopefully you’ve already got a pair of USB-C or Bluetooth headphones – if not, you’ll have to fork out more money to buy some.
There’s both an in-screen fingerprint screen and a face unlock option if you want biometric access to your phone. I found face unlock to be very unreliable and when I used it, and more often that not I was relegated to using the traditional PIN-entry method, however the fingerprint scanner worked very well.
Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite – Camera
The Galaxy S10 Lite has a triple rear camera – the main sensor has a 48-megapixel resolution, then there’s a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and it’s completed with a 5-megapixel macro lens. Is it one of the best camera phones around for the price?
Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite main camera shot
In the above image taken in daylight by the main camera, detail capture is strong. Generally colours were fairly muted with the main camera.
Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite main camera
Overall the camera performance was not bad, but I felt that the images looked slightly overexposed and lacking depth of colour, and nowhere was this more clear than when shooting in low light.

Night Mode Off (left); Night Mode On (right)
The first example, above, shows relatively little difference between shooting without Night Mode (left) and with Night Mode (right); the signage on the stadium is more legible, but the colours look more washed out.

Night Mode Comparison: Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite (left) / Huawei Mate 30 Pro (right)
To really demonstrate how this low-light shooting is lacking, the above images compare the same shot taken by the Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite and the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, both with Night Mode on; Huawei’s effort provides far more depth of colour compared to the somewhat anaemic S10 Lite’s result.
Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite ultra-wide camera shot
The wide angle lens offers a useful option when you want to take a “step back” from the subject and expand your field of view. This lens does distort the image somewhat, which negates the realism of the photo, but sometimes it can be a neat effect to emphasise scale.

Shots with the ultra-wide camera reproduce more vibrant colours than the main camera, and its inclusion certainly adds welcome versatility to the device’s photographic arsenal.

Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite – Battery life
The battery has a 4500mAh capacity, which is a considerable size, matching the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and beating all other handsets in the S10 range.
After streaming a 96-minute film, the battery was cut down from full to a still-healthy 88%. It lasted through a busy day of travel and tourism, when I used the camera and Google Maps and other demanding apps frequently, but I did have to put it on charge before heading out later in the evening. This device should easily last you through a working day, and then some.
Charging is also one of the phone’s strong points. Going by our results it should take you not far over an hour to charge the phone from zero to full. Here’s the full breakdown of the charging times:

You won’t be let down by the battery on this device, and it charges right back up in short order too. These are two of the strongest reasons to recommend the phone.
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite?
If you are prepared to part with a decent chunk of cash, but haven’t quite got the funds for a top-flight flagship, then you should consider the Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite.
Among this class of phones it has great performance stats, an attractive design, a very good battery and strong fast-charging – but we’ve seen better cameras around for the same price, such as the Xiaomi Mi 9 and the Google Pixel 3a.

Verdict
































Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is the first true flagship to arrive this year –  and boy, is it a powerhouse device. Highlights include a 108MP main camera, up to 16GB RAM and a 6.9-inch 120Hz display. Samsung might win the spec war, but how does it fare in the real world?
Instead of offering a more affordable alternative to the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Galaxy S20 Plus, we’ve got a far pricier option in the form of the Galaxy S20 Ultra. During a period where consumers are holding on to their phones longer and spending less overall, this move seems somewhat odd.
With a starting price of £1199, the S20 Ultra costs more than the iPhone 11 Pro Max (£1149) and if you look at the US prices then it’s a lot more expensive than Apple’s high-end flagship – $1499 vs $1099. With no foldable screen, you might be wondering quite why this phone costs so much. 
The S20 Ultra is also a bit pricier than the new £1149 Galaxy S21 Ultra (though not by much). The S20 Ultra’s successor launched this year as part of Samsung’s Galaxy S21 range. We’ll be posting our review of the S21 Ultra soon, but you may want to hold off on upgrading until then.

Here’s everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S21

There are many reasons why the S20 Ultra is so expensive and how important the reasons are to you should help decide whether or not the phone is for you. It’s fully 5G, for example, with no 4G-only option offered. It also attempts to push the industry forward with a mammoth camera array, a screen size that dwarfs just about everything else.
Samsung has thrown everything at the S20 Ultra – but just how much of it sticks? 
Camera

Three cameras on the back. Including a 108MMP main sensor
Periscope zoom gives some good results
Still some issues with focussing

The S20 Ultra’s set up includes four rear cameras plus a 40-megapixel selfie shooter on the front. 
The main camera packs 108-megapixels and an f/1.8 OIS lens. Add to that a 12-megapixel ultra-wide and a 48-megapixel telephoto and you’ve got the most megapixels ever on a Samsung phone.

We’re not big fans of the 100X zoom branding on the back
This is merely a small part of a story, however. The idea here isn’t to shoot at 108-megapixels, or even 48 megapixels for that matter, but to use all the data collected to create superior 12-megapixel snaps. For instance, the 108-megapixel camera will combine nine pixels into one much larger pixel, while the telephoto will do the same but with four pixels. This should, in theory, let far more light into the sensor and produce a brighter, sharper photo. 
First off, I will say that you shouldn’t shoot in the 108-megapixel mode – even though it’s offered as an option. Aside from being slow to shoot, the actual pictures are oddly flat and lacking in sharpness. You’ll get a sharp central point, with details lost as you move out.
I’ve also had some issues with the autofocus system, which regularly struggles when you’re moving quickly between subjects. On more occasions than I’d like I found myself waiting a few seconds for it to lock on. Samsung has said it is issuing a software update to fix this though, so I will update this review when that is live.
The star of Galaxy S20 Ultra’s camera skills is the zooming. Labelled Space Zoom (and plastered on the camera module), this works in a similar way to the Huawei P30 Pro – inside the there is a series of mirrors and lenses laid out flat with light reflected through the rectangular hole on the back of the phone. This trick allows for impressive ‘optical’ zoom without the need for a big lens attachment.
Samsung advertises Space Zoom can go up to 100x and, while it can, I wouldn’t advise using it for anything more than a quick play around when you first unbox the phone. This is because, unless you have a tripod, shooting like this is tough due to all the shaking going on, and trying to focus is virtually impossible.
At 10x you’ll still be able to easily make out detail. Especially good for sporting events
However, stick to ranges up to 10x and you’ll capture some fantastic shots packed with serious amounts of details. The below pictures of a football stadium, for instance, would not have been achieved by an iPhone 11 Pro or Pixel 4.
The camera deals with shadows very well, though the sky here looks a little too blue
 
Here’s the 5x zoomed version of the above photo

The S20 Ultra takes excellent photos with lots of detail and a colour palette that’s a bit more restrained when compared to older S-series phones. You’ll still see slightly more saturation and pop to reds and greens than an iPhone 11, but nowhere near as much as before.
The large sensor also helps give a very natural looking depth-of-field effect without having to resort to the faux-bokeh mode. Focus on something and the background will blur, bringing the foreground into sharp focus.
The classic saturated look of previous Samsung flagships is especially obvious in bright daylight shots
 
Sometimes, when shooting macro, they’ll be a sharp focus point (here towards the right) that leaves the rest look a little fuzzy
 
The camera deals with colours well and has great dynamic range
 
The ultra wide angle pictures are good
 
The large sensor gives a lovely natural bokeh when you’re shooting up close
If you take a lot of photos of people then it’s important to note the S20 Ultra has a tendency to overly smooth out details in skin, giving them a somewhat unrealistic appearance. This feels like a stylistic choice with the processing.
Another example of the nice depth of field you can achieve
There have been great strides in low-light performance over the past 18 months and the S20 Ultra once again impresses when the lighting conditions aren’t great. Pictures retain detail, avoid overblowing the highlights and manage exposure well. Focusing can be a lot slower at night though, and I would give the dedicated Night mode a miss – it gives the image too much of an orangey hue.
Quality of the 5x zoom remains excellent, even when the lighting is low
 
Low light shots deal with the changing conditions and exposure well
 
Sample with night mode off
 
With night mode on everything is a bit too yellow and unnatural
The headline video addition across the entire S20 series is 8K capture, and it certainly stands out on paper – even if phones like the LG V60 pack the same capability. Shooting 8K uses the telephoto 64MP sensor, so things are cropped in a little and it can be restrictive when you’re already up close. 
8K, a bit like the 100x zoom, feels more like a feature Samsung hypes up rather than one the average consumer is going to really make use of. The footage, which is shot at 30fps, is very sharp – but you’ll need some form of 8K display to really see that come through.
The camera is supremely capable. Samsung’s post-processing remains behind the likes of Google and Apple, and that’s why we’ve got all these megapixels at play. You might be disappointed if you felt the high megapixel count was going to take mobile photography to the next level – these shots still look like they’ve come from a phone, but the results are still great. If you’re a fan of pictures from previous Samsung phones then these are the very best versions of those Samsung photos.

All the best camera phones in one handy guide

Design and Screen

120Hz OLED display is excellent
1440p resolution and HDR support

If you’re not a fan of phones with large screens then the Galaxy S20 Ultra is not for you. It dwarfs other Samsung phones, even the historically big Note series, and almost makes the iPhone 11 Pro Max look compact – I didn’t think I would be saying that a few months ago.
It features an outright huge 6.9-inch display that covers the majority of the front and curves slightly around the phone’s edges. The only obvious item breaking up the otherwise all-screen aesthetic is a small hole-punch notch in the middle of the top edge. Make no mistake this is a glorious OLED panel, but that shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who has used a flagship Samsung phone before.
The tentpole feature this time around is a jump from 60Hz to 120Hz. For non-techies, this means the screen now refreshes twice as many times each second making everything far smoother. Trying to describe the differences in refresh rates is hard and, even though this is a tired cliche, you just need to see it to really understand the benefits. Movement is smoother, swiping is quicker and less jittery – the phone just feels faster.
However, adding 120Hz doesn’t come without some slight downsides. The biggest being its dramatic effect on battery life. Even though the S20 Ultra has a 5000mAh cell, enabling the smoother motion left me with a phone that only just about made it through the day, heavily cutting my screen-on time compared to 60Hz. This is likely the main reason why Samsung has decided against letting you keep the resolution at WQHD+ (3200 x 1440), with 120Hz instead restricted to FHD+ (2400 x 1080).
That move will likely annoy some, it did annoy me initially, as you’re essentially forced away from making the most of a display you’ve spent over a grand on. But, thankfully, at 1080p it remains a very sharp, colour accurate panel that sets a new standard for FHD screens.

Along with upping the refresh rate, the touch response has been doubled to 240Hz, making the display feel super responsive when you’re interacting with it. I have even had some instances where the display feels a bit  too responsive and I ended up accidentally clicking something I didn’t mean to. This is made even more obvious by the sheer amount of accidental presses that occur due to the curved display.
Thanks to the 6.9-inch OLED screen, exceedingly high levels of brightness and the usual array of HDR options mean that the S20 Ultra is a fantastic device for watching media on. HDR-enabled shows on Netflix feel like they’re really taking advantage of what’s on offer and when compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max there’s deeper contrast and far more brightness. The smaller notch (when compared to the S10 series) helps make it a more immersive display, too.
Two screen modes are available: Natural and Vivid, with the latter being on by default. This has more saturation (reds have a neon finish and greens can look a little lurid) and is a little more pleasing on the eye, however I prefer the DCI-P3 focussed Natural mode which is more colour accurate and less garish.
The Galaxy S20 Ultra is a boring phone to look at and it feels like a real step in the wrong direction for Samsung visually. It’s not ugly or offensive – it’s just kind of dull. The two colour options (grey and black – give me some colour!) are dull and the same curved design Samsung has used for years is beginning to feel a little tired.
While the S20 Ultra’s design isn’t terribly exciting, it is very well built. The finish is pristine and the material high-end. It feels expensive, with a heft that more budget-focused phones lack.
If you’ve seen renders and images of the phone you’ll likely have noticed the behemoth of a camera on the back. It looks bad in these images, however, it’s not something I have noticed or disliked while using the phone. I actually quite like these over-the-top camera modules as it adds a bit of extra character and distinctiveness. Of course, as it’s not flush the phone wobbles about on tables and you’ll need to add a case if you want to avoid this.
Other important things to note here are the lack of both a headphone jack (hardly a surprise, but this is the first S-series flagship to ditch the 3.5mm port) and a physical fingerprint sensor. Samsung has once again stuck with the ultrasonic in-display sensor from S10 and Note 10 and, honestly, I hate it. We had such a good thing going with ridiculously fast capacitive sensors and none of these in-display alternatives are anywhere near close to being as fast. 

The sensor might work without lighting up the whole screen, a benefit it has over optical versions, but it requires a firm press and lacks reliable accuracy.
The S20 Ultra retains the IP68 rating of its siblings, packs a hybrid dual-SIM slot that can take two SIMS (one 4G, one 5G) or a SIM and microSD card.
Performance

Exynos or Snapdragon chipsets depending on where you live
5G support on all models
Samsung’s One UI overlay over the top of Android

If you like specs, then you’ll love the Galaxy S20 Ultra. If you love comparing spec-sheets and gazing in awe at how much RAM a phone has then the S20 Ultra should immediately grab your attention.
This is a powerhouse of a phone, chock-a-block with top-drawer components. At the heart of the phone is the Exynos 990 (in Europe) or Snapdragon 865 (in USA) along with either 12 or 16GB RAM and 128 or 512GB UFS 3.0 storage. Check out the specs table below for a more comprehensive breakdown.
For this review, I have been using a European Galaxy S20 Ultra powered by the Exynos 990 and 12GB RAM. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Qualcomm edition varied in areas like battery life and benchmark scores as we’ve seen this previously with Samsung phones.
For all these high-end internals, the S20 Ultra runs and performs like any other flagship Android. You can play any game from Google Play at the best settings without a hitch, lag in the UI is virtually non-existent and apps open instantly.
You will notice that the extra RAM (and I assume the way the software utilises it) lets apps sit in the memory for a lot longer – up to a few days in my tests. Bringing a game that you haven’t touched since the morning before back to life is great, and this feels like a genuinely helpful advancement.
While Samsung phones, those with Exynos chips at least, are fast to begin with, it is months and years down the line where things start to fade. Apple’s phones are so good at staying fast for years that I always feel let down by Samsung in this regard. My Note 10 Plus, for example, takes an extra second longer to load apps now than it did at launch – will the same happen here?
I don’t put too much stock in benchmark tests for phones, however they do give a neat overall look at how basic performance changes between models. See below for how the S20 Ultra compares against the OnePlus 7T Pro (Snapdragon 855), iPhone 11 Pro (A13) and Huawei Mate 30 Pro (Kirin 990).

The S20 Ultra is a 5G phone. Of course, it retains support for 4G, 3G and 2G networks but it doesn’t come in a flavour that eschews 5G completely. If you’re in an area where 5G is limited, or non-existent, you’re paying more (Samsung said around £100) for a feature you won’t make use of yet. This is a bold move but I think it’s a move needed to push 5G forward and into more hands.

5G in the UK

I’ve been using the phone with both a Vodafone SIM on 5G and a Three SIM on 4G. Where 5G is available the speeds are good, but it’s the extra bandwidth that makes the real difference. In a busy station, for example, I can now easily browse and download stuff – something that’s rarely possible on 4G.
The phone might be dual-SIM enabled, however only the main slot has 5G support. You couldn’t pop two 5G SIMs in and utilise the next-gen network on both. There’s Wi-Fi 6 support too and I have been thoroughly impressed with both call quality and data connections.
Software
TouchWiz branding might have been absent from Samsung phones for years, but it’s only recently that the software on the brand’s phones has recovered from years of, well, being awful.
The One UI 2.1 software here is one of the best, most fully-featured and slickly designed versions of Android you’ll find. It’s not as ‘clean’ (Samsung still has loads of duplicate apps) as the skins you’ll find on OnePlus and Pixel phones though, even if the feature list is exhaustive.
Customisability is key here; whether it’s changing how the phone performs while you’re gaming to how fast or high-res the screen is, Samsung lets you tweak lots of things to work how you want them too.
Typical Android features aside, the S20 Ultra adds in some extra Samsung tricks. DeX mode remains for allowing you to connect the phone to a Mac or PC to access info and apps from the phone and a new direct share function is a bit like AirDrop – letting you quickly send files, via Wi-Fi Direct, to other S20 devices.
Bixby has also been relegated thanks to the lack of a dedicated button for the still-lacking virtual assistant. You can turn off pretty much every instance Bixby would appear and just use Google’s far superior Assistant instead.

Battery life

Inside there’s a 5000mAh battery
Charger in the box
Wireless charging supported too

This is a section where there could be some differences if you have the Qualcomm version of the Galaxy S20 Ultra or the Exynos one. There were huge gulfs in battery life between the models of both the S10 and Note 10, with the Snapdragon variant seemingly lasting a lot longer. All my thoughts here are from the European Exynos version.
Over the course of my week with the S20 Ultra my battery life experience has changed numerous times. With the 120Hz refresh rate on and two SIMs (one 5G) enabled I struggled to make it through from 8am to 10pm without getting nervous and topping things up before I left the office. 
Slip back to 60Hz at WQHD+ and 5-6 hours of screen on time is a lot more achievable, often meaning I didn’t need to charge the phone at night. Tone it down even further to FHD+ and an extra hour is possible.
If you want the phone to comfortably last you the day, the options are there to make that happen. If you know you’ve got a charger nearby and want to really push that display then that option is available too. This is great, even if it does feel like you have to lose some of the phone’s best attributes in order to get the best battery life.
When the S20 Ultra does run out of juice, the included 25w USB-C PD charger gets you from 0-100% in just over an hour. Seriously impressive stuff for a 5000mAh cell. 30 minutes of charging got me from 0-57%, so even if you forget to charge the phone overnight you can top it up before you head to work.
Alongside this, you’ve got Qi wireless charging (15w) and you can use the phone as a wireless pad for other Qi-enabled devices with the Wireless Powershare feature. This is handy for adding some juice to add-ons like Galaxy Buds, but it does quickly eat through the phone’s battery life.

You should buy it if…
If you want a very capable zoom camera
While some of the Space Zoom 100x zoom features are a little pointless, if you’re only going up to 10x then the results are really quite good. You don’t this kind of zoom unless you have a periscope camera.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want the best flagship camera
Samsung couldn’t quite beat some of the best competition in the smartphone camera space with the S20 series, even the priciest Ultra. It’s good, just not fantastic. The Ultra also still suffers from camera focussing issues.

Verdict




























 



The Redmi 7A is cheap but nonetheless cheerful in a couple of key areas – particularly the battery, but also the screen and build quality. However, its underwhelming internal specs make it hard to recommend, even at its low price.



Pros

Cheap
Robust build
Decent screen
Incredible battery life



Cons

Sluggish performance
Pitiful storage capacity
Micro USB port rather than USB-C

The Redmi 7A is a budget smartphone from the Chinese brand Xiaomi. Priced below £100, this is the kind of handset you should only take into consideration if you want your phone to do the basics, and you’re not even close to being a “power user”.
We’ve been very impressed with Xiaomi’s efforts in the mid-range of the market, including the 5-star Xiaomi Mi 9, so can the brand pull off a similarly impressive performance in the budget sector?
Xiaomi Redmi 7A – Design
The Redmi 7A has a black plastic casing that feels robust and hardy to the touch, and what’s more the matte finish means it doesn’t pick up fingerprint smears. There’s one camera tucked away at the top left hand corner, and it’s highlighted with a silver reflective ring around the lens in one of the few touches of flair present. The front of the phone has fairly thick bezels at the top and bottom; the chin is branded with the Redmi logo and the top houses the speaker and selfie camera.

With regard to more practical concerns, the design is “splash resistant” (with no specific IP rating), and is kitted out with a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top and a Micro USB port on the bottom. It’s reassuring to see the former, but a little tedious to see the latter still present on a device now that USB-C has pretty much become a universal standard on all the best mid-range phones and best Android phones.
The design of the Redmi 7A is not flashy but it is functional; the only missed opportunity is the lack of a USB-C port.
Xiaomi Redmi 7A – Screen
The Redmi 7A has an LCD screen that measures 5.45-inches and has a resolution of 720 x 1440p. I was pleasantly surprised when switching on the Redmi 7A for the first time because for a cheap phone, the screen is good – it’s quite bright and has good levels of detail.

It might not be a totally immersive screen for people who spend a lot of time watching video content, but it undoubtedly works well if you’re just using your phone to send messages or emails, giving you a crisp and clear display.
It’s smaller than most smartphone screen these days, and having been used to larger displays I did miss the extra space – but some might prefer the smaller form factor if they find it easier to handle.
Xiaomi Redmi 7A – Performance
The Redmi 7A runs on a Snapdragon 439 chipset, paired with 2GB of RAM. It’s not a powerful device by any means – you’ll never get your hands on top-end silicon at this price – and unfortunately, this does show in performance specs and everyday tasks, where apps can be slow to appear and there are occasional stutters when navigating through the interface. Demanding games simply don’t run at all on this smartphone.
But perhaps even more egregious than the lack of power is the lack of storage space; the handset ships with a mere 16GB, which might have been decent enough for an iPod Nano twelve years ago but simply doesn’t cut the mustard for a modern smartphone. On start-up, only 8.94GB of that was actually usable, so the Micro SD card slot is not so much a convenient option as a practical necessity.
While performing the performance benchmarks (below), I had to delete apps to run the full tests, and this device is physically incapable of actually running the Geekbench 5 test we usually put smartphones through. This performance is evidently lacking, and it’s worth paying a few extra quid for a device that can run day-to-day applications without problem, not just today but also a couple of years down the line.

However, one bright spot is that I was pleased to receive the update to the MIUI 11 interface during my time using this phone, as cheaper phones can often be overlooked by OEMs when it comes to software updates.
Overall it’s hard to recommend a smartphone with such little power – it’s definitely worth paying a bit more money for a better performance.
Xiaomi Redmi 7A – Camera
Just as you can’t expect a great performance from a device at this price, you can’t expect this to be one of the best camera phones either. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by some of the results from the camera – while its weaknesses were obvious.
The leaves on this tree were nicely captured.
Firstly, when in broad daylight shooting objects in the mid-distance, the camera performs pretty well, giving nicely balanced images with good levels of detail.

The above image of food lacks the warmth that better cameras could provide, and in general I did find that colours were quite muted and never really “popped”. It’s certainly acceptable if you use your camera as a kind of note-taking tool, but it’s not the kind of performance that will set your Instagram ablaze.
However, the real disappointment with the Redmi 7A’s camera arises when the sun goes down.

Day (left) vs Night (right)
The above comparison shot shows the exact same area by day and by night. The first shot once again encapsulates the device’s capabilities, with decent levels of detail even though the image looks a little washed-out. I’d certainly still describe that as an acceptable performance for this price point, but as you can see in the night time shot, this camera simply cannot deal with bright lights in a dusky evening setting. The bright spots are blown out to such an extent that images are more or less unusable.
London’s National Gallery at night time
It’s not the only example where the camera wasn’t able to deal with bright spots at night – it’s the same in this image of the National Gallery, where the lighting on the wall blurs everything into a non-distinct white and street lights leave white spots across the image. The below image taken inside a bar lit with small fairy lights, where the camera struggled to focus and delivered a significant loss of detail.
The Redmi 7A struggled to capture the dimly lit bar
So don’t expect to get great shots in every scenario – but if you just take the odd photo in daylight, or if you generally tend to use your smartphone camera to snap pictures just to remind you of something later, then it could be acceptable.
Xiaomi Redmi 7A – Battery life
No corners have been cut when it comes to the Redmi 7A’s battery – it’s got a colossal capacity of 4000mAh, the equal to many of today’s flagships. When you bear in mind that it has a relatively small screen and an undemanding processor, that battery doesn’t even break a sweat in usage – after a solid hour of watching YouTube videos, the fully charged battery had dropped by a mere 1%.
We can’t comment on the efficiency of the charger, as the review sample was supplied with a foreign plug, but as mentioned previously it’s a little disappointing that the device is still stuck with a Micro USB port rather than the more convenient USB-C.

It’s worth saying again – the Redmi 7A’s battery life is exceptional. In itself that doesn’t make up for some fundamental shortcomings, but it’s always a big relief to know that you can rely on your phone to make it through a busy day.
Should you buy the Xiaomi Redmi 7A?
The Redmi 7A undoubtedly has some recommending factors, from a solid construction, to a good screen, and especially its excellent battery. But its sub-par performance combined with a poor storage capacity are compromising factors that makes it difficult to recommend.
If you’re only going to do the most basic tasks with the phone and you’re not so keen on smartphone photography then this could possibly work for you – but take a look at the other smartphones in your price range in our comprehensive guide below.

Verdict




























 



A big, balanced, budget phone with appealing specs for the price – although the 720p display resolution is a downer, and ColorOS doesn’t do it any favours against the cleaner UIs of Motorola and Nokia.




Pros

Strong battery life
Solid performance
Decent specs for the price



Cons

720p display
Weighty handset
ColorOS is way too busy

If you’re seeking a £150 (ish) smartphone that covers all the bases then you won’t be short of options these days. Motorola, Huawei or Xiaomi will probably serve you well, but a certain Chinese brand has quietly begun to flex its budget phone muscles in recent years. Realme might not have the cachet of its rivals, but it certainly turns out some robust and affordable handsets, including the new Realme 5.
Following hot on the heels of the well-equipped €299 Realme X2, the Realme 5 could be the brand’s most accessible effort yet. Having launched in select European markets for just €169 (around £142), with such eye-catching specifications as a quad-camera and a 6.5-inch screen, it’s well worth a closer look.

Realme 5 design – Big, solid and surprisingly flashy
Talking about design in a sub-£200 smartphone can be a rather dispiriting process. After all, you’re unlikely to get any desirable materials or fancy flourishes for this kind of money.
Just about the best you can hope for is solid build quality and a handset that doesn’t look or feel like a toy. On those modest terms, the Realme 5 comes up trumps. And it even manages to exhibit a certain amount of bling with moderate success.
You don’t get any nasty surprises from the front of the phone. It’s mostly screen, with an 89% screen-to-body ratio, a teardrop notch, and a slightly thicker chin. None of which is unusual for affordable phones these days; but points for consistency.
Around the back, though, Realme has chanced its hand with a segmented, angular finish. It’s still all-shiny plastic, and a total magnet for your greasy paw prints. But the shifting tones of the finish (which Realme calls “Crystal Design”) are quite distinctive, which is an achievement.

You also get a fingerprint sensor, which is well positioned on the back, if perhaps not quite recessed enough for my liking. Still, it’s fast and reliable.
The rim of the phone is a more matte form of plastic, while the volume and power buttons have been positioned on the left and right edges respectively. They’re a similar size and texture, which probably makes this separation a smart move.
Everything else of interest – unless you count the dual SIM/MicroSD tray just above the volume buttons – is along the bottom edge. Here you’ll find a 3.5mm headphone jack (yay), a micro-USB port (boo) and a solitary speaker.
The latter is plenty loud and clear enough, but the sound is tinny and thin. Again, you have to weigh your expectations carefully here; meaty stereo sound is still very much a flagship feature.
This is a surprisingly weighty phone at 198g. But then you consider the Realme 5’s 6.5-inch display and 5000mAh battery, and the extra bulk makes more sense. Don’t sign up if you value compactness in your budget phone, though.
The Realme 5 is deemed “splash-proof in normal daily usage, but not applicable to extreme situations”. The sheer fact that there’s no official IP rating should prevent you from taking any dips with it.

Realme 5 display – Big and bright, but a little shy on pixels
We’ve already established that the Realme 5’s display is big; 6.5-inches makes it the same size as an iPhone 11 Pro Max.
That’s about where the comparisons end, of course, but this is still an IPS LCD panel that gets plenty bright. It’s reasonably colour-accurate, too; but if you find it a little warm or cool for your liking, ColorOS packs a handy slider to help you adjust. Rare props to Realme’s custom UI there.
The screen’s biggest shortfall is a lack of sharpness. We’re dealing with a 720 x 1600 “HD+” resolution, which really isn’t many pixels to be stretching over such a large canvas; 269 ppi is nothing to boast about here, even in the sub-£200 category.
In general navigation this doesn’t pose a particular problem. But bring up a web page containing image thumbnails (such as the website previews from a Google search) and you’ll notice an off-putting blurry, smudgy effect, like they’re yet to load in properly.

The same applies when you’re scrolling through your picture previews in Google Photos – and, of course, YouTube videos (or any videos, for that matter) are going to be stuck at 720p.
I’d say that the provision of such a low-res display is just about forgivable at this price. The £179 Motorola One Macro is equipped with a similar display, as is the £230 Xiaomi Mi A3, so the £150(ish) Realme 5 is hardly an outlier.
But even in this context, the decision to go with such a large screen seems a little misguided.
Realme 5 performance – Competent and hitch-free
The Realme 5 runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 665 CPU. This is the same lower-mid-range chip that powers the Moto G8 Power and the Xiaomi Mi A3.
Two of the three Realme 5 models come with 4GB of RAM, while some markets will have access to an even cheaper 3GB unit.
My model was the 4GB RAM/128GB storage one that will be offered in Europe, and it handled most things fairly fluidly. Homescreen navigation was smooth, the phone woke quickly from sleep, and jumping into the camera app was pleasingly snappy.

I did spot a few minor pauses and sluggish moments when navigating through some menus or tapping on notifications, but this may well have been down to the clunky animations of the custom ColorOS UI. Ultimately, it isn’t anything to frustrate.
This is far from a media-playing monster, of course. On the gaming front, PUBG Mobile defaults to the Low settings, although I was able to bump it up a notch to Medium/Balanced and still enjoy its sprawling Battle Royale gameplay – albeit not flawlessly.
Netflix playback is fine and fluid, but then at 720p you’d jolly well expect it to be.
Realme 5 software – ColorOS 6 is another gaudy Android wrapper
The Realme 5 runs Android 9.0 Pie out of the box, but it’s coated in a thick layer of custom UI called ColorOS 6 (or ColorOS 6.0.1, to be precise).
Custom UIs aren’t necessarily bad news – one look at a OnePlus or Motorola phone confirm this to be the case. But Realme’s approach is more in line with Huawei’s and Xiaomi’s: that is, fundamentally stable – but also overworked and a little gaudy.
The app icons and pale app tray aren’t a million miles away from stock Android, but the notification menu feels like a backwards step. It isn’t offensively ugly or distractingly wacky, but it just feels messier and more cluttered. It’s an all or nothing affair, with a full screen of notifications, confusing icons, a brightness slider, and shortcut widgets all vying for your attention.
You’ll also find a custom “Smart Assistant” when you drag to the left of the homescreen. This might suggest a Google Assistant replacement, but it’s more like the iOS Today View in the way it provides you with a series of widgets for weather and calendar functions.
You also get a Step Tracker, a shortcut to recent photos, and – far less usefully – a link to a few popular apps you might want to download from Realme’s own App Market.
Ah yes, the apps. Realme doesn’t quite go so far as to duplicate or supplant every last Google app and service with its own. But it does install a bunch of mystifyingly superfluous stuff.
The Opera browser comes preinstalled, which is a perfectly decent third-party web browser. But why presume to install it alongside Chrome? The same goes for the Webnovel app, which is a service that grants access to a bunch of books and comics.
Our model came with the Lazda shopping app, which (along with the charger) seems to indicate we were sent an Asian model. Presumably this won’t come preinstalled on the European model, as it’s useless to a Western audience.

Realme 5 camera – Not a true quad, but not bad
This is a budget phone we’re dealing with here, so when I note that the Realme 5 has a quad-camera setup, it should instantly sound a note of caution.
Sure enough, this camera isn’t quite as flexible as it sounds. A 12-megapixel f/1.8 main sensor is a decent start, as is an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide. But there’s no telephoto lens for zoomed shots, so the 2X and 5X options rely on cropping, with increasingly noisy results.
A macro lens and a dedicated depth sensor round out the selection of four, both of which weigh in at 2-megapixels and f/2.4.
I recently encountered a similar mixture of sensors in the Huawei Nova 5T, which is more than double the price of the Realme 5, so it would be harsh to hold Realme to account for its approach.
What’s more, the phone is capable of capturing vibrant, well-balanced shots in good lighting. The AI Scene Recognition picks out the requirements of the scene pretty reliably, employing HDR and bringing in the Macro lens when necessary, as well as bolstering the colours when photographing greenery, for example.
However, I did notice that a number of my landscape shots resulted in a curiously pronounced grainy effect to the blue skies in the background.
Night-time shots of reasonably well-lit streets, meanwhile, proved to be an absolute write-off. As in, unusable. In low-light conditions, such as in restaurants, the Realme 5 wouldn’t always focus properly, and the results could be a little noisy.
The 13-megapixel f/2.0 selfie camera isn’t too bad, and Realme’s Portrait mode managed to pick out my outline and dial up the bokeh quite effectively.
Default 1X scenery shots look pretty good, but look at the noisy skies
2X shots look okay given the lack of a telephoto lens
5X is where the noise really comes in
Indoor close-ups don’t always seem to focus uniformly
Shots can really pop with vibrant colour
The Realme 5’s AI Scene Recognition is good at handling auto HDR, but check out the noisy skies
An f/1.8 sensor leads to nice bokeh, even without Portrait
The Macro sensor is invoked automatically, but you still can’t get super-close
The Realme 5 is downright terrible in low-light situations
Portrait selfies come out pretty crisp and well defined
Realme 5 battery life – Huge battery yields predictably strong battery life
As we’ve already mentioned, Realme has packed its latest budget phone with a huge 5000mAh battery, which in part accounts for its heft. This is the biggest battery the company has ever supplied in a phone.
With a mere 720p display (albeit a huge one) to power, this yields some impressive stamina. You’ll comfortably get through a day and a half to two days of moderate use on a single charge. Light users will get even more mileage, provided they don’t hit the media hard.
On that front, one hour of Netflix playback with the screen set to full brightness sapped 9% of the phone’s juice in my testing. This isn’t particularly impressive if you look at mid-range handsets running on more efficient processors – the Realme X2 ate just 7%, for example. However, it’s very strong within its class.
You’d be looking at roughly double that energy consumption with the more expensive Nokia 7.2, for example. It also outperforms the Motorola One Macro by around 3%, and that’s one of the stronger budget performers in this media-driven battery test.
The Realme 5’s blunt-force approach to battery life works well, then. It doesn’t charge particularly quickly, with a fairly meagre 10W charger bundled – but that isn’t unusual in a budget phone. It’s the same kind of provision you get with the Motorola One Macro.
Through testing the Realme 5 managed to go from 46% to 62%, gaining 16% of a full charge, in half an hour.
Should you buy the Realme 5?
The Realme 5 is another strong value proposition from Realme, offering a large, well-specced handset with a quad camera and decent performance at a low price.
Its huge 6.5-inch display doesn’t play particularly nicely with a low 720p resolution, but you’d need to spend more money to get the same level of performance from the phone.
While the quad-camera isn’t quite as impressive as it initially seems, it’s still capable of taking vibrant snaps in good lighting. And its huge battery means that stamina is a strong point.
ColorOS should probably dissuade fans of clean, unfussy UIs. But, otherwise, the Realme 5 deserves consideration alongside the cheaper efforts from Motorola, Xiaomi and Huawei.

Verdict




























 



The Oppo A5 2020 is just the kind of phone I end up recommending most often to friends. Its cost is low enough to make a SIM-free buy perfectly reasonable, it looks good and should have the CPU power, RAM and battery capacity to make use headache-free.



Pros

Big battery
Big screen
Sensible price
Smart looks



Cons

720p screen
Plastic back

The Oppo A5 2020 is a cheap phone dressed up as an expensive one. Its back looks like glass (it isn’t), the phone has four rear cameras and a screen as big as those some of the most expensive phones in the world.
It’s like a Moto G8 Plus, just better or worse in a few respects. Battery life is a highlight, but the most picky may take issue with the relatively low-resolution screen.
The Oppo A5 2020 costs £179 SIM-free, and is available for free on some affordable contracts.

Design
To look at the Oppo A5 2020 and to play with it first-hand are different experiences. From arm’s length it looks quite similar to the OnePlus 6T. The curved back is a spit for glass, and there’s no giveaway sign this is a “cheap” mobile even in finer elements like the camera surround.
Well, aside from its use of a rear finger scanner pad, no longer seen in truly expensive phones.
Pick the Oppo A5 2020 up and the situation changes a bit. The back is plastic and the phone is relatively thick, 9.1mm.

However, glass backs in sub-£200 phones are becoming rarer as prices creep upwards slowly. The Oppo A5 2020 also has the best possible excuse for its thick frame. Oppo chose to give it a plus-size battery rather than keep a millimetre off.
Both of these points melt away if you use the included case anyway. The Oppo A5 2020 comes with a basic transparent silicone case, like other cheap Oppos, and has a factory-applied screen protector.
You have to be pretty unfortunate or careless to damage your A5 2020 on day one.

Size is one of the main reasons not to buy this phone, though. I used the Samsung Galaxy A90 5G before the Oppo, so my hands were ready for another large mobile. But if you like a smaller handset, this is the wrong phone to buy. It’s wider than the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, before you add the bulk of the case.
There are no other major annoyances to the Oppo A5 2020’s hardware. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack, the rear fingerprint pad is faster and more reliable than a lot of the in-screen scanners I’ve used over the last three months. You get NFC, sometimes missing from cheaper phones, the 64GB storage is enough for most people, and if it isn’t you can add a microSD card to the SIM tray.

Even its speakers impress. They are loud, and both robust-sounding and low on distortion at high volume for an affordable phone. It’s a major benefit if you like to listen to podcasts through your phone while cooking or in the shower.
These are stereo speakers too. There’s one above the display, another in the conventional spot on the bottom.
The Oppo A5 2020 has no official water resistance. You can find YouTube videos of the phone being submerged for a short period, though, and they suggest it is well constructed enough to avoid a quick accidental dunk ending too badly.
Screen
The Oppo A5 2020’s display is large and tall. This is a 20:9 6.5-inch aspect screen, close to the once eyebrow-raising shape of Sony phones like the Xperia 10.
It can fit in a lot of icons, or article text, before you need to start scrolling. The teardrop notch is pleasant too, using a swooping cut-out rather than the abrupt circle of the Moto G8 Plus.
Big screens like this are great for games and video, and this is only partially limited by the price-cut tech underneath.

The Oppo A5 2020 display is of 1600 x 720 pixel resolution. It is not ultra-sharp and, switching from a 1080p phone, the softer character to text in particular is noticeable.
Colour is not notably bold or rich either. It’s similar to the “natural” or “neutral” setting you might find on a more expensive phone, and there’s no way to jack it up if you want a bolder appearance. The Oppo A5 2020 does not have a “vivid” mode.
You only have control over the colour temperature. A slider lets you make the screen warmer or cooler. This is standard stuff for an affordable phone, although nowadays the Moto G8 Plus is only slightly more expensive and it has a sharper 1080p screen.
This is one of the few barriers to recommending the Oppo A5 2020. The screen is far from bad, but you do not have to may significantly more to get better hardware.
Software
The Oppo A5 2020 currently runs Android 9 and Oppo’s ColorOS 6 interface. This is not the latest version of Android, or the prettiest custom skin.
I started using Oppo phones regularly last year when its distribution finally reached full speed in the UK. My first impression ColorOS was of a certain stiffness, mostly caused by its use of square, fairly sharp icons.
I still think ColorOS is not that much of a looker. But a handful of phones in, I like it well enough. Don’t be too put off, in other words. There’s also less to get in the way, and fewer incongruous parts, than in LG and HTC’s Android skins.

There’s an apps drawer, a vertical scroll similar to that of standard Android. And if you prefer a drawer-free experience more like that of an iPhone, you can have it. Customisations like this and choosing how many rows and columns of icons sit on the home screen are available.
The two obvious extra parts are the Smart Assistant home screen and the one-handed aid. Smart Assistant is effectively a scroll of curated widgets. I don’t find it useful, like every single one of these extra home screens, but it is a quick way to check your step count, the weather and the day’s calendar events.
Oppo’s one-handed UI aid is a little box that appears when you flick from the side of the screen in a specific area (marked with a little translucent patch). The panel is home to shortcuts you select, letting you run apps with fewer swipes and less thumb stretching. I haven’t used it once. But given several manufacturers add this, someone must be.
Performance
The Oppo A5 2020 has the same CPU as the Oppo A9 2020, a Snapdragon 665. This is an eight-core processor with four Kryo 260 Gold cores and four Kryo 260 Silvers. The Moto G8 Plus uses the same CPU too, telling you this is the budget Qualcomm processor of the moment. It has 3GB RAM.
General performance is perfectly good. In the move from the Samsung Galaxy A90 5G to this phone, I have noticed apps take a little longer to load, and there’s occasionally a little pause before the settings menu pops up. But after three days, I honestly stop noticing the minor change of pace.
There’s no grating lag, certainly nothing that will remotely make you wish you paid three times the price and bought something higher-end.
Gaming is limited in the typical manner for a good budget Android. You can play any game you like, but some will only let you use lower graphics settings, or will run jerkily at the higher ones.
Ark: Survival Evolved and PUBG will only run on low graphics, for example. However, both games still look good at this setting (remember to max out the resolution slider in Ark for the cleanest look) and run well. Asphalt 9 seems susceptible to occasional obvious jerkiness, but it’s likely because the game’s wacky style means the amount the phone has to render can vary wildly from second to second.
Camera
The Oppo A5 2020 has five cameras, four on the back and one on the front. Oppo is aggressive in its use of multiple sensors and lenses, in part because it looks good on paper, and on the phone itself.
My issue is the very same I had with the Oppo Reno 2Z and A9 2020. Two of the rear cameras have such low-end hardware they have very little meaningful impact on the photos you take.

The Oppo A5 2020’s primary cameras are 12-megapixel 1/2.8-inch sensor with f/1.8 lens and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide with a 1/4-inch sensor. It’s B-grade hardware for the main module, C-grade stuff for the second, and that’s perfectly fine in a phone at this level.
Our two other cameras have tiny 1/5-inch 2MP sensors and lens apertures so tiny you could barely fit a pin through them. They are here, according to Oppo, for black and white and depth photography, which means one of the cameras helps construct a depth map for portrait images in which the background is blurred. And the B&W camera may be used for the black and white filter mode – there seems to be little difference whether the 2MP cameras are covered or not in the final results.
The Oppo A5 2020 just doesn’t seem to need the extra hardware, and a standard 2-megapixel camera sensor is arguably not good enough to create a particularly good depth map of a scene anyway.
Moans out of the way, how is image quality?
It’s typical of one of the most accomplished budget phones. The Oppo A5 2020 has a very effective Auto HDR mode that makes the camera much less picky about the lighting in a scene. Day lit scenes with moderate light contrast tend to look rich, punchy and detailed.
The Oppo A5 2020 only really struggles with the extremes. Night images are passable for a budget phone, but look much softer and less detailed than a good higher-end camera with optical stabilisation or one of the better, “trendy” ultra-low light modes designed to radically improve handheld low-light shots.
You can see the camera’s limits in some scenes of very high light contrast too. While the auto HDR is excellent for sheer shadow detail lifting, there’s occasionally some discolouration of the darkest and lightest areas. Areas in the sky might take on a green tint, or darker parts a purple one. And the detail lifted out of the shadows is not as clean as that of a top-end camera.
This camera sensor seems of good quality, but is not a match for the Google Pixel 3a’s. Its specs aren’t either. Oppo has not told us the exact sensor chip used, but it has 1.25 micron sensor pixels to the Pixel’s 1.4 micron ones. Smaller photosites mean lower native sensitivity.
There is a also a difference in image quality between the primary camera and the ultra-wide. Your ultra-wide images will tend to look softer, lower in contrast and have poorer texture detail. The lens aperture is relatively narrow too, at f/2.3. However, it is unrealistic to expect Oppo to be able to match sensor quality at this price and I’m mostly just grateful for the extra field of view.
The wide also takes perfectly good images in daylight, a real benefit for holiday snaps and shooting large buildings up close.
Oppo’s background blurring is more picky than some, but the results are as good as any
This is a good demo of the auto HDR – the sun is in the shot, but lots of colour and detail is visible in the foreground
Auto HDR is doing its thing again, but the left side of the sky is left with a colour tint

The Oppo A5 2020 switches to a “macro” mode when up close, but it has no notable skill in this area – not bad for £180, though.
 
Night images are sometimes passable for a phone at the price, but you don’t get advanced low-light shooting
Without stage lighting to lean on, this shot is left with very poor detail
The ultra wide view…
…versus the standard one
The front camera is perfectly solid too. It has an 8-megapixel sensor and f/2 lens, and is capable of capturing fine facial detail, and tends to let in some fine grain noise rather than trading away such detail for a smooth look. There are several “beauty” features if you’d rather have flattering images for your social posts.
Video does not seem to be a focus of the Oppo A5 2020, though. You can shoot at 720p, 1080p of 4K, 30 frames per second. I’d advise sticking to 1080p most of the time as you lose stabilisation at 4K.
Annoyingly, the footage preview at 1080p doesn’t show the effects of the software stabilisation on the fly. You’ll only know how smooth your video will look by reviewing it after the fact. However, stabilisation effectiveness is fine.
Battery Life
The Oppo A5 2020 has a 5000mAh battery, among the largest seen in any phone of a conventional size and shape. Don’t underestimate how ultra-high capacity like this can change your relationship with your phone.
No more worrying about the charge level before you go for a night out. You can charge it every other day if you like. And on several days I have been left with around 50% charge by bed time.
On the last day of testing, by which time I had stopped needing to do any more specific testing, it has 63% at 11pm. After a particularly hard day that included three hours of data tethering to a laptop, it still had 35% left by bed time.

Some of you will be able to get the Oppo A5 2020 to last two full days. The way I use phones is a often bit too demanding for that result, but this phone still outlasts the vast majority of mobiles by a big margin, including just about all flagships bar the odd Huawei. And Huawei phones are no longer easy to recommend, having been severed from Google services.
Living with the Oppo A5 2020 is a joy. However, charging is slow. You get a standard 10W charger, and it is nowhere near the fast charge standard of getting you to 50-60% in half an hour. It was at 22% after 30 minutes, and 69% after 90.
This is a phone you may want to charge overnight. But not all of you will have to do so every night.

Should you buy the Oppo A5 2020?
The Oppo A5 2020 is a great budget Android that has some of the same appeals as the highly regarded Motorola Moto G line. Four rear cameras may catch the eye, but Oppo has not forgotten basics like speaker quality, everyday performance and battery life in favour of the attention-grabbing tech.
Its quad-camera array is not as good as you might imagine, offering performance functionally similar to a good budget dual camera layout. But to get something significant better you need to upgrade to the Google Pixel 3a XL, which is still far more expensive.
It’s a great affordable Android, but it’s a success because of the basics, not its quad-camera tech.

The Motorola Moto E6 Play is the most affordable phone in Motorola’s extensive range. And when you consider that the Lenovo sub-brand has carved out a formidable niche for itself in the value handset market, that’s quite an achievement.
At a launch price of just £89, it’s slightly cheaper than the £99 Moto E6 Plus and a little more expensive than last year’s £79 Moto E5 Play. Hopefully, this price lowers your expectations somewhat.
This isn’t a device for heavy users, mobile gamers, or those who care about the quality of their photos. It’s for those who want to spend the absolute minimum on a new handset, are willing to make a number of compromises to hit that low bottom line, but would prefer the core experience to be fundamentally sound. However, even on these terms the Moto E6 Play is far from an unqualified success.
Moto E6 Play design – Well-balanced and discrete, if smudgy
The Moto E6 Play steps back a little from the modern design concessions of the Moto E6 Plus. Out goes the latter’s notched display, which served to push the screen-to-body ratio more in favour of the screen.
Instead, we get a plain rectangle flanked by two chunky but evenly proportioned bezels to the top and bottom. It’s the way pretty much all phones used to be designed up until 2017 – and some more recent (and expensive) phones, such as the Xperia 5 and the Pixel 3A, continue with this approach.
Flip over the E6 Play and there’s a more modern glossy back cover, although it’s resolutely plastic rather than glass. It isn’t removable, so neither is the battery – a wise step back to normality from the E6 Plus in our view; though others will differ.
It’s a total fingerprint hazard, of course. But we’ve come to expect that, even with significantly more pricey handsets.
Around a third of the way down the rear of the phone you’ll find the familiar “Batwing” Motorola logo, which also serves as a fingerprint sensor. I’m pleased to confirm that this is reliable and reasonably quick – when the phone’s sluggish processor manages to keep up, that is.
There’s the option of a face-unlock facility, too, although given that it’s far less secure than fingerprint authentication, you’re probably better off keeping it switched off.

There’s a sense of solidity and balance that continues onto the right edge of the phone, where the power and volume buttons sit. They’re plasticky, but the power button is textured and sized completely differently, which makes both units easy to feel out.
There are a couple of notable inclusions and exclusions we should mention. The presence of a 3.5mm headphone jack continues to be welcome, if increasingly non-essential. It’s also good to see Motorola including a clear plastic case in the box – users of an £89 phone may be less precious over their phone, but they’re also less likely to be willing (or able) to splash out for repairs and replacements.
On the flip side, you get a micro-USB port in place of the superior USB-C for charging. That’s a shame, but it’s also a common concession down at the bargain basement end of the market.
Finally, there’s no NFC, which means no Android Pay mobile payments.
Moto E6 Play display – Clear and colour-accurate, it’s fine for every day tasks
Motorola has gone with what could be considered a smaller display size in the Moto E6 Play. That isn’t to say that 5.5 inches is exactly compact, but these things are all relative. The Moto G7 Play packs a 5.7-inch display and the Moto E6 Plus has a 6.1-inch screen, to name two similarly priced examples.
Given that this is a phone that will likely be bought a lot for kids, it seems smart to keep the screen size well under 5.5 inches. I’d suggest that Motorola perhaps should have gone even smaller and avoided some of the compromises found elsewhere, but we’ll get to those in a bit.
With this smaller size, the Moto E6 Play display wears its HD+ (1440 x 720) resolution a little better than the Plus. True, a pixel density of 295ppi is nothing to shout about, but it’s perfectly acceptable in a sub-£100 phone.
You may have come to expect Full HD as the bare minimum for affordable phones. But the Moto E6 Play belongs to a tier that’s below what we’d usually term affordable. As such, HD+ is just fine.
What’s important is that this IPS LCD is reasonably clear and colour-accurate, and that everyday tasks look crisp enough. Which they do. Sure, if you go pixel-peeping in Google Photos, it won’t take long to notice the fuzzy edges. But if you’re intent on doing that then we’d politely suggest that you may have either bought the wrong phone or set your expectations too high.

Step outside and you’ll find that the display washes out somewhat in the light. But this is a common issue even with more expensive phones, and the E6 Play remains usable regardless. Conversely, the auto-brightness is often too aggressive at reigning things in when you’re in lower lighting conditions.
Motorola has also returned to a more regular 18:9 aspect ratio for the Moto E6 Play, which remains a better bet than some of the super wide-screen alternatives. It’s far closer to the general standard adopted by streaming and media services, which means fewer chunky black borders and compatibility issues.
Moto E6 Play performance – Stutters and shutdowns are all too common
Performance is the Moto E6 Play’s defining weakness. We don’t expect a sub-£100 phone to be blazingly fast – or even moderately fast for that matter. But we do expect a base level of fluidity when doing the basics, and that just hasn’t been provided here. There are frequent stutters and slowdowns while flicking between the homescreens and menus, and occasional lengthy pauses when waking or powering up the phone. Jumping into the camera app can be teeth-grindingly slow.
A large part of this performance shortfall is down to the choice of CPU – a MediaTek MT6739 quad-core chip that trails even the modest silicon provided for the Moto E6 Plus before it.
This wretched chip was considered unworthy when it shipped in the Honor 7S in mid-2018. I found it to be similarly terrible in the Alcatel 1X around a year later. It hasn’t miraculously become any better in early 2020.
Another factor is the provision of just 2GB of RAM, which we’ve generally found to be too little for a fluid Android experience. This lack of memory really shows when switching between apps. 

Needless to say, if you’re at all into your mobile gaming – and particularly fast-paced 3D games such as Call of Duty Mobile or PUBG Mobile – then you’ll want to set your sights a little higher than the Moto E6 Play. You can play both games on Low settings, but they won’t be very pretty or fluid.
Regardless, the phone’s poor performance level should make anyone that values a smooth smartphone experience think twice about a purchase. As tempting as it is to give the Moto E6 Play a pass because of its price, the harsh truth is that you don’t need to spend much more for a markedly improved experience. Even within the Motorola stable, an extra £10 will get you the Moto E6 Plus or the Moto G7 Play – both superior options.
Moto E6 Play software – Clean, in every sense of the word
The Moto E6 Play doesn’t join the Motorola One family in adopting Android One, but it might as well have done. The experience is very similar indeed to Google’s lightweight stock Android provision. This is Android 9.0 Pie, more or less exactly as Google’s boffins dreamed it up. 
In fact, the Moto E6 Play – just like the Moto E6 Plus – is arguably even less Motofied than the company’s other phones; even its Android One models. You don’t get any of Motorola’s gesture-based shortcuts here, for example. Which is actually a bit of a shame come to think of it, since they’re quite handy.
Another positive effect of Motorola’s approach here is the complete lack of extraneous apps. Google’s impressive suite of applications handles everything from email to calendar maintenance. Chrome takes care of your web browsing, Google Photos manages your images, Messages yours texts – which is all in blissful contrast to rival efforts from Huawei, Oppo and the like.
Anything extra can be downloaded from the Google Play Store of course, and there’s ample storage for such customisation. You get 32GB as standard, which is a decent amount for such a cheap phone. There’s also potential for expansion, courtesy of a microSD slot.
Moto E6 Play camera – On a night out, leave it in your pocket
Motorola has rolled its photographic game right back to just a single 13-megapixel f/2.2 sensor for the Moto E6 Play.

We’d never judge a phone camera’s capabilities by such a crude numerical measure, of course – just look at the Pixel 3A for evidence of what can be done with one sensor. But it should surprise no one to learn that the E6 Play is no Pixel 3A.
Daylight shots are frequently murky and poorly exposed, with no auto-HDR mode to counter those bright skies. You need to manually activate HDR, which will improve those muddy foregrounds. But HDR shots also tend to overexpose and to leave ghosting effects on moving elements.
Motorola’s crisp Camera UI can help to mitigate some of the exposure issues: just touch and swipe up or down to take direct control. But it’s far from ideal.
At night-time, or in low lighting, you might just conclude that it’s better not to bother taking any snaps with the E6 Play at all. Low to moderately lit restaurants yield murky, blurry, poorly focused food and dining partner shots, while out in the dark of a British winter’s night the noise is overwhelming. A dead-steady hand and plenty of patience is essential, and even then…
While we’re on the subject of patience, I’ve mentioned already how slow the Moto E6 Play can be to even get into the Camera app. We’re talking more than a few seconds at times, which is an age in smartphone and photography terms.
No second camera – and no Google-like software and hardware trickery – means that there’s no Portrait mode to call on here. As such, you’ll need to work to get your own modest bokeh effects and sharp subjects.
With HDR off by default, bright skies can really ruin regular shots
The E6 Play struggles to focus in less than perfect lighting
The colours are nice and accurate, but there’s a lack of sharp focus here
Even with a steady hand and lots of artificial light, this night shot is noise-central
This daytime shot (albeit on a miserable day) came out murky and weirdly focused
With plenty of light and no extremes of light, the camera can take some okay shots
With HDR on you get overexposure and ghosting effects
By default, the foreground elements came out a little murky here
Moto E6 Play battery life – Around two days is good going for light users
One area in which the Moto E6 Play has the potential to really excel is battery life. But it will only do so provided you’re not attempting to consume much media on it. And given the aforementioned performance woes, you probably shouldn’t be.
While a 3000mAh battery might sound respectable rather than outstanding, it has to be considered within the context of the Moto E6 Play’s other specs. With a low-power CPU and a relatively modest HD+ display, it simply isn’t as power-hungry as most other phones.
The results can be very good if you’re a light user. I was able to get two and even on one occasion three days of usage out of a single charge. The key to this was using the phone only for the bare essentials – some messaging, a couple of phone calls, and some light web browsing.
However, choose to use the Moto E6 Play for some more intensive media playing and you’ll need to fall into the usual nightly charge routine – or even find a handy wall socket. I found that an hour of Netflix streaming, with the screen cranked right up to full brightness, drained 21% of the battery. A decent result would have been around half of that.

Recharging isn’t massively speedy with the bundled 5W charger, either. Plugging the E6 Play in at 60%, it gained 9% in 15 minutes, while a further 15 minutes yielded the same result.
Should you buy the Moto E6 Play?
The margins are fine when you’re shopping at the very bottom of the smartphone market. While the Moto E6 Plus makes a lot of sense at £99, the Moto E6 Plus is a lot tougher to justify at £89.
It feels like the cheaper phone has made one compromise too many with its poor CPU, and the frustratingly halting performance that results from this component. A camera that fails in some fundamental areas is another cut too far.

Our best cheap phones offers better budget picks

Solid design, a decent screen and clean Android software make the Moto E6 Play a tempting proposition at the price. But spending just a little more money will result in a much more enjoyable day to day experience.
It’s always a tricky business balancing out the various features of a sub-£100 phone, but the Moto E6 Play trips up in two fatal areas. This budget phone’s performance is simply too compromised for comfort, while its stripped-back camera makes it difficult to get usable results in everyday conditions. 
Cheap isn’t always cheerful, and you can do a fair bit better by spending just a little more money.

The Motorola One Hyper is the brand’s latest mid-range phone in its Android One series, which aims to offer clean software and long-term support with good-value hardware at a modest price.
Most other devices in the series have an obvious key selling point, with the Motorola One Action providing a GoPro-like action camera and the Motorola One Zoom packing a 3x telephoto zoom. It’s hard to see what the name “Hyper” is supposed to evoke, other than a children’s birthday party fuelled by a load of sugar, but the headline specs here include a 64-megapixel main camera sensor, a 4000mAh battery equipped with fast-charging, and a high-quality screen.
Design

An eye-catching mid-ranger

The Motorola One Hyper is available in two colours – ‘Fresh Orchid’, which a purple hue, and ‘Deep Sea Blue’, which is the bluish-turquoise colour of our review device.
Motorola One Hyper rear panel
It’s a firmly mid-range smartphone, so you can’t expect a high-end glass-and-aluminium construction; the back panel and the frame is made of plastic, and it feels it. Nonetheless, it’s got a shiny finish and an understated stripe that lines up with the dual camera, with the rear fingerprint scanner mounted in the middle of the device.
As with many handsets, this one picks up smears fairly easily. I found its appearance unremarkable, but it did receive a couple of compliments from friends who admired the shimmering finish.
One design aspect of the phone which I did appreciate – and again, did cause people to take notice – is the pop-up camera, which ensures a notch-free display. The selfie snapper rises from the top of the phone fairly promptly when you tap the icon in the camera app.
Motorola One Hyper lock screen
Taking a look at the more practical aspects, the inclusion of the 3.5mm headphone jack and the option for expandable storage via SD card (up to 1TB) are both much appreciated in an era where flagship phones are doing away with such things, and additionally the phone supports NFC for making contactless payments.
The device offers just a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner rather than an in-screen option or face unlock, and neither of these losses would affect me in theory – they’re more convenient for sure, but their absence is hardly a deal-breaker, especially in the reasonably priced segment of the market. However, I found this fingerprint scanner to be a little unreliable, either requiring a few attempts or failing to unlock and forcing me to tap in my PIN instead, which was somewhat irritating.
The power button (which has a textured finish) is one the same side as the volume control toggle, and I found I needed two hands in order to take a screenshot.
Overall it’s still a good functional design, with a notch solution that’s bound to be a major attraction to those wanting an uncompromised full screen experience.
Screen

 A notch-free, sharp LCD

The Hyper’s LCD screen measures 6.5-inches diagonally and has a 1080 x 2340 resolution. The aforementioned lack of a notch means you get the uninterrupted full-screen experience, and the slim bezels that surround the screen are by no means chunky enough to detract from your immersion.
The display is sharp, with text appearing crisp, and colours bright (albeit not with HDR enhancement for the ‘popping’ effect you get from some expensive handsets).
It’s not an OLED, so you won’t get pitch black tones but I was not at all disappointed when watching video content or scrolling through the browser. Bearing in mind that plenty of phones at this price point still opt for a 720p resolution as a cost-cutting measure, this display certainly emerges as a recommending factor for this phone compared to its peers.
Motorola One Hyper browser
One very minor niggle was the reliability of the reactive brightness setting, which sometimes dimmed inappropriately in darker settings – a little irritating but hardly a deal-breaker as you can easily switch off this mode in the Settings app. When the device is on standby, it displays the time and battery capacity along with notification symbols when it’s moved, but otherwise rests on a black screen rather than having an always-on display.
Motorola One Hyper standby screen
The sharp, fairly big display is a good reason to choose this phone over similarly-priced handsets – if you regularly watch videos on the go, this would be a good-value choice.
Performance

Not a powerhouse, but enough for most people

The Hyper’s chipset is the Snapdragon 675, and it remains one of the least impressive entries on its specs sheet. Released in October 2018, it’s a firmly mid-range proposition that probably won’t be the right fit for you if you’re a power user who makes high demands of their smartphone when it comes to playing games or video editing. The Hyper pairs it’s modest chipset with 4GB of RAM.
Below is a table of how the performance scores stack up next to another Android One mid-ranger, the Xiaomi Mi A3, to which it compares favourably.
(Note: Geekbench 5 measures CPU performance, 3D Mark measures gaming performance, and Antutu measures overall performance)

In everyday use I found that this device got the job done, albeit occasionally there were stutters or slight delays when I was multitasking (a habit encouraged by the Android 10 user interface). A couple of times apps shut down unexpectedly (the guilty parties being Facebook and The Economist), but generally I found that apps ran well. It was mostly smooth when switching between tabs even if I’d had them open for a while. When running a very demanding app (namely Asphalt 9), graphics at the default setting were adequate though not super sharp, and I didn’t notice any lag.
If you’re a power user hoping to get your fix on a budget, there are better options available (take a look at the Snapdragon 710-toting Realme 3 Pro for instance) – but if you just use your smartphone for relatively simple everyday tasks, the Hyper should be up to the job.
Software

Android One continues to impress

The Motorola One Hyper is a member of the Android One programme (alluded to by the “One” moniker), which means that it’s one of the first in line for software updates from Google. It’s got guaranteed operating system updates for two years and security updates for three.
This might not seem altogether impressive compared to Apple’s long-term support, but does represent significant improvement with regard to Android mid-rangers (which can otherwise be forgotten by manufacturers shortly after launch).
Motorola One Hyper homescreen
Thanks to this arrangement, the device runs the latest Android 10 software with a minimalist philosophy – the software is the full-fat operating system run by other smartphones, but gone is the unnecessary bloatware that some Android manufacturers are prone to packing their devices with, so instead you’ll get little more than the traditional Google suite of apps. In my opinion this is a boon for performance and functionality.
By default the Hyper employs uses the gesture system introduced by Android 10 which can take some people a little while to get used to, but you can switch to the traditional three-button system in the settings if you wish.
The stripped-down, straightforward software experience offered by this smartphone is ideal. It’s a good example of Android done right.
Camera

A decent main camera but the ultra-wide is a bit of a let down

The camera is a dual-lens set-up, consisting of a 64-megapixel main sensor and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide snapper. Motorola has been keen to advertise the former, and a bit more reticent when it comes to the latter, and there’s a reason for that.
Motorola One Hyper main camera
The main lens performs well, giving images that are strong on detail and nicely balanced.
Motorola One Hyper main camera
Results generally look fairly pleasing without being over-processed, with tones remaining natural. Hence this overcast view down the Thames is faithfully reproduced rather than overcompensated for by leery, enhanced colours.

Main camera with Night Vision off (left) and on (right)
Low-light performance is also pretty good: Night Vision software mode does reduce noise a smidgen and bring out deeper colours, but even when this mode isn’t turned on, the result is still respectable.

Main camera (left), ultra-wide camera (right)
However, switch to the ultra-wide and unfortunately you’ll find lower-quality, distorted images. The comparison image of the building above is a good example of the drop-off in quality, showing good levels of detail and warm colour representation from the main camera, while the ultra-wide results are distorted, less sharp, and duller. Frankly, I’d have preferred the device to have stuck to just one lens and passed on the saving in a lower price rather than include this underwhelming ultra-wide.
Motorola One Hyper selfie camera
The selfie camera has an unusually high 32-megapixel resolution. The resulting images have good levels of detail when it comes to hair for example, again escaping the over-processed look that is often even more pronounced on the front-facing snapper.
Battery life

More than enough juice for a heavy day’s use

With a capacity clocking in at 4000mAh, the battery is one of the Hyper’s leading recommending factors, even beating out Android flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 (3400mAh). Bearing in mind its less demanding screen and internals next to such devices, I was expecting a strong showing – and I wasn’t disappointed.
Given a long day (7am to 11pm) of fairly heavy usage, where the device entertained me with podcasts and magazines through a lengthy commute both ways, played music at my desk, and showed videos on my lunch break before a spot of gaming in the evening, the battery tended to be reduced to around 35% from full.
After a weekday night out with friends on top of the daily drudge, there was still easily enough charge that I could comfortably summon an Uber for the journey home after the last possible public transport had long since gone.
Of course, on this level of use, you won’t be able to make the phone last for two days straight, as the manufacturer claims – but if you’re a fairly modest user then that’s not too far-fetched.
Fortunately, it’s also got impressive form when it comes to charging, thanks to the 27W Turbo Charger supplied in the box. Judging from the scores recorded below, you’ll easily get a day’s charge after half an hour of charging, which is ideal if you’ve forgotten to charge your phone overnight. The device doesn’t support wireless charging, but that’s to be expected at this price point and I didn’t find that to be an inconvenience at all.

The battery is certainly one of the most impressive features of this device – not only is it beefy enough to easily see you through a full day of heavy use with no issues whatsoever, but it recharges speedily too. If you opt for this phone, you won’t be worried about it dying on you when you most need it.

A headphone jack and decent speaker, but below par call quality

The Hyper has two small speakers – a tiny one just above the screen and another on the base of the phone, while the 3.5mm audio port is also present on the top of the device.
The inclusion of the headphone jack is always a positive – audio quality is better through wired headphones and it’s always to easy to pick up a cheap pair of earbuds at an airport or train station if you’ve forgotten yours, and pallor at the prospect of a long journey without audio entertainment.
If you like to go wireless, it was very quick and straightforward to pair the device with Bluetooth headphones, and it reconnected promptly and reliably as well.
The speakers were loud and clear, and moreover, the haptic vibration feedback was also notably strong, so you won’t fear missing out on a pressing notification.
However, I must admit that the call quality on this handset was a real disappointment. I struggled to hear what people on the other end of the line were saying, as their voices sounded faint and muffled. While more and more people are using messaging apps to communicate, call quality should still be a fundamental feature for any device that calls itself a phone.
Should you buy the Motorola One Hyper?
This is a good smartphone at a reasonable price, so if you’re looking for an all-round performer that doesn’t break the bank then this is a good bet. The screen is high quality, the main camera is good and the battery life is excellent – three very big ticks on most wishlists. But there are a couple of things that hold me back from giving this device my full-throated enthusiasm.
The shortcomings of the ultra-wide lens mean that this device doesn’t offer the versatility provided by some competitors, and there are better processors around for less money too – but a more disappointing shortcoming is the poor call quality, which could be a real source of frustration if phone calls are your preferred method of communication over messaging apps, emails, or texts.
Verdict
Overall this is a good all-round device that offers a strong showing in key areas such as camera, battery, screen, and software. It’s held back by some slightly underwhelming factors (such as an inconsistent fingerprint scanner, poor call quality, a poor ultra-wide camera) that stop it from being recommended by reflex, but nonetheless it stands out as a very solid mid-range performer.

Verdict




























 



The Realme X2 Pro offers excellent value for money thanks to a powerful processor, large battery, great screen and an attractive design. It will be an excellent choice for most, but if camera performance is a priority then you might want to look elsewhere.



Pros

Enduring battery life
Attractive design
Versatile camera
Strong performance
Good value for money



Cons

Inconsistent camera






Key Specifications

Review Price: £499.99
161 x 75.7 x 8.7mm
4000mAh battery
Quadruple camera
Android 9, Color OS 6.1
256 GB storage, 12GB RAM
Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset
6.5-inch screen, 1080x2400 resolution


The Realme X2 Pro is the highest-spec smartphone available from the Oppo subsidiary – a brand that generally focuses on lower-budget devices.
The headline specification for this device is the Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset, the very best available from Qualcomm at the time of launch. In addition, the handset includes an eye-catching quadruple camera.
The price you pay will depend on your selection of RAM (ranging from 6GB to 12GB) and storage (available with either 128GB or 256GB), with the base model coming in at €449 (or £385). It’s available in two colours: Neptune Blue or Lunar White.
It seems reasonably priced then given the specs, but let’s delve a little deeper to find out how the Realme X2 Pro fares for performance.
Related: Best budget phones
Realme X2 Pro design – It catches the eye, for the right reasons
The rear panel of this Realme X2 Pro is a deep blue colour with a glossy finish, which catches the light nicely for a hint of class. It’s smooth to the touch, although it does pick up smears and fingerprints easily. The only adornments to the back of the phone are the Realme logo, which is set perpendicular to the vertically aligned quadruple camera unit. There are a couple of subtle gold accents on the phone, one being a circle surrounding the main camera lens, and the other being a highlight on the power button.

As for the front of the phone, the screen is a fairly substantial 6.5in with slim but noticeable bezels running round the edge. At the top there’s a wide speaker set above the screen and a subtle teardrop notch jutting into it.
Overall, this is a good-looking device that’s attractive without looking too flashy or gaudy.
Realme X2 Pro camera – A four-camera setup, but low-light images are disappointing
As mentioned, the Realme X2 Pro is kitted out with a total of four rear camera sensors, comprised of the following:

64-megapixel main wide-angle camera
13-megapixel telephoto sensor with 2x optical zoom
8-megapixel ultra-wide lens
2-megapixel depth sensor


Theoretically, this arrangement offers a good deal of versatility – and while performance is mostly very good, there are a few caveats.
Realme X2 Pro main camera: Food
This close-up of food shows the X2 Pro main camera’s strengths, with high levels of detail and colours that are lively and well reproduced.
Realme X2 Pro main camera: Flowers
However, the above image of flowers that was also taken with the main camera proved disappointing, with the petals appearing pinkish rather than the deep red of the actual subject.

Realme X2 Pro: Nightscape off vs Nightscape on 
But it was low-light performance that was especially mediocre. Without the night mode applied, the bright lights are completely blown out and detail is poor. In the “corrected” image (slide right), taken with Nightscape, the blown-out highlights have been reduced only a little, and there’s a warm yellow glow to the image – but the detail is far worse. Would you be happy with either image on your Instagram profile?

Realme X2 Pro: Main Camera vs Ultrawide Lens
The above image contrasts the main wide-angle lens. There’s a noticeable colour shift when switching between the two, which is immediately obvious if you’re browsing your gallery. But there’s a little distortion around the edges, which can occur when taking some ultra-wide shots. Detail remains decent, although is a noticeable step down from the main camera.

Realme X2 Pro: Ultrawide Lens vs Telephoto Sensor
This image taken from the football stands shows the zoom on the 3x telephoto lens in comparison to the ultra-wide, demonstrating the impressive range this camera setup offers. Shots from the telephoto were clear.
Overall, there’s a decent level of detail on display in the pictures and there’s plenty of versatility in these shots. But there remain disappointing aspects: colour representation, for example, particularly with regard to the low-light shooting. It’s still a serviceable camera for a mid-range contender, but it’s one area where it notably falls short of its flagship rivals. If photography is your absolute top priority, perhaps look elsewhere.
Realme X2 Pro display – Bright and crisp, this screen is worthy for all types of content
The screen measures 6.5in, with just a small teardrop notch located at the top. I didn’t find this slight intrusion distracting. In fact, I found the screen a pleasure to use since it’s particularly bright and crisp. Videos, social media feeds, and games are all enjoyable on this display, which boasts a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels, further enhanced by HDR10+. What’s more, this AMOLED display has a refresh rate of 90Hz, which makes scrolling super-smooth – and in this respect the screen here matches expensive handsets such as the OnePlus 7T Pro and the Google Pixel 4.

This is an excellent screen for the price point, and is one of the phone’s best features. It’s a letdown only if you’re a notch-phobe. Otherwise, it ticks all the right boxes.
Realme X2 Pro battery – The 4000mAH unit is unlikely to let you down
The X2 Pro packs a 4000mAh battery, which seems plenty generous. It exceeds the size offered by flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and leaves the Google Pixel 4‘s 2800mAh battery in the dust.
It lasts well through the day, even with high usage. I didn’t ever worry about it running out on me. If you only use your phone in moderate amounts, you’ll likely get through a couple of days without a top-up. To take a real-world example: one hour of video streaming took the battery down from 100% to 95%, which stands up well in comparison to some thirstier rivals.
The Realme X2 Pro boasts incredible 50W SuperVOOC fast-charging capabilities, but the adapter supplied isn’t compatible with a UK plug socket, so we can’t comment on this definitively. But both Realme and its parent company Oppo have an enviable track record for blistering fast-charge capabilities, so we can well believe the claims.
Realme X2 Pro performance – Everyday tasks prove no problem at all
One of the key recommending factors of the X2 Pro is that it runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus, Snapdragon’s most powerful mobile chipset of 2019 (you’ll find it on other top-performers such as the OnePlus 7T Pro).
This is one of the very best chipsets you can buy. On this device it’s paired with 12GB of RAM, so it will come as no surprised to learn that it runs everyday tasks with ease. Mobile games also perform excellently on the X2 Pro, working in tandem with the screen for a smooth and responsive experience.
Below are the performance benchmarks compared to the high-performing Huawei Mate 30 Pro, which it exceeds in several key respects:




Geekbench 5 Single-Core
Geekbench 5 Multi-Core
AnTuTu
3DMark Slingshot Extreme


Realme X2 Pro
634
2405
468,070
5943


Huawei Mate 30 Pro
746
2881
445,446
5677



If you’re a gamer or a power user looking for a powerful device at a reasonable price, then it’s hard to look past the Realme X2 Pro.
Realme X2 Pro security and software – Up to date security features work a treat
The X2 Pro offers both a fingerprint scanner and face unlock for easy access, and registering for both of these methods doesn’t take long at all. While the active area for the in-screen fingerprint scanner seems quite small, it didn’t prove a problem when I tried unlocking the device. Likewise, the face unlock worked swiftly.

The operating system is Android 9, with ColorOS 6.1 being the user interface. Fortunately, aside from the basic tools that come in handy, there aren’t too many pre-installed apps, so it escapes the charge of bloatware. The software runs smoothly on this device and it feels clean and easy to navigate.
Should you buy the Realme X2 Pro?
If it’s in your price range, then the Realme X2 Pro is likely to be a strong contender due to it offering great value for money and a strong performance in the right areas. The screen and general performance are both excellent, battery life is super-reliable, and the design is tasteful too. In all of these respects, it’s well worth the money.
Photography is the key negative in this device’s all-rounder credentials – you might be better off with a specialist such as the Google Pixel 3a, if that’s your priority — but otherwise the Realme X2 Pro is an excellent handset for the price.

Verdict




























 



The Moto 360 isn’t quite the smartwatch comeback we hoped for. It’s decent enough, but there are certainly more exciting and better-looking options out there. 



Pros

Well built
Includes two straps
Upgraded processor and storage



Cons

Expensive
No big software extras
So-so sports tracking






Key Specifications

Review Price: £339.99
1.2-inch 360 x 360 OLED
5ATM waterproofing
GPS
Wear OS



What is the Moto 360 (2019)?
Back when Google’s Wear OS was known as Android Wear, Motorola was among the handful of tech companies that embraced the smartwatch platform, launching the Moto 360 in 2014.
After the rectangular looking LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live, it marked the first smartwatch to put Wear inside of a circular watch case. It was arguably the most popular of those first gen options and while it wasn’t perfect, there was a whole lot more to like about than LG and Samsung’s early efforts.
A second generation 360 landed in 2015 and after that Motorola went quiet on smartwatches. So the third Moto 360 lands a fair few years after the last one, except all is not as it seems. This is not made by Motorola, but by a company called eBuyNow. Motorola opting to license out the smartwatch brand in an effort to revive it and bring it in line with the smartwatches of today.
Moto 360 (2019) Design – Neither chunky or elegant
The original Moto 360 was in many ways a major breakthrough in terms of making a smartwatch that didn’t feel like it was built by a tech company. With the second generation 360, Moto realised that both men and women might want to wear smartwatches and offered two size options and a nicer range of looks.
The new Moto feels like it’s stayed true to the look of past generations, and in many ways I wish it was more daring on that front. You’re now getting just the one size option, with the 42mm watch available in a stainless steel, rose gold or phantom black options. That’s combined with a 20mm strap that is available in leather and a more sport-friendly silicone and both are included with the watch. 
There’s a crown to scroll through Wear and a single button marked with the Motorola M logo, that can be assigned to your favourite apps and features.
It weighs in at 52g and measures in at 13mm thick when you factor in the heart rate monitor around the back. So you’re not getting the slimmest smartwatch you can currently wrap around your wrist. In comparison, the Apple Watch Series 5 measures in at 10.7mm and Fossil’s latest Gen 5 is closer in thickness with its 12mm thick body. 
It’s not a chunky watch by any means, but it certainly doesn’t feel very elegant or sleek either. There’s no denying that this is a sturdy, well-built smartwatch that veers on the side of a classy, suit-friendly watch, but it’s a design that just feels a little too safe.

Moto 360 (2019) Screen – No flat tyre here
The first Moto 360 will forever be remembered as the smartwatch that looked a little like a flat tyre, thanks to the black bar at the bottom of the touchscreen display. It certainly wasn’t the only one guilty of not going fully round, but it was definitely the first to do it.
Thankfully, there is now a fully round 1.2-inch AMOLED touchscreen delivering an impressive 390 x 390 resolution, which is a notable upgrade on the 360 x 330 resolution LCD screen that was packed into its predecessor. 
In a way, the spirit of that flat tyre hasn’t entirely disappeared. There’s now a black bezel that surrounds the display that essentially spreads it out further, which is not so noticeable when the screen is asleep. As soon as you wake it up though, it’s not the prettiest sight – it’s a shame that the bezel eats up so much screen estate.
The quality of smartwatch displays on the whole have stepped up a notch since those early Moto 360 days, and the display on the new 360 is bright, vibrant, and offers good colours and viewing angles.
If you care about having an always-on display, just like you can on the latest Apple Watch, the new 360 delivers on that too. 
Moto 360 (2019) Features – The usual Wear OS attractions
Like its predecessor, the new 360 is leaning on Google’s Wear OS to tick the software box. It’s the latest version, which means the most recent changes made, like Tiles, and features, like the revamped Google Fit, are in place. It’s a pretty pure Wear experience, with very little in the way of extras outside of some watch faces.
It does those staple smartwatch things like dishing out notifications for your paired Android smartphone or iPhone, has a built-in music player to pile on your tunes, access to Google’s Assistant smart assistant, and you can delve into the Play Store to get more Wear OS apps. The onboard NFC means you have Google Pay at your disposal if you like the idea of paying for things from your watch.
It’s a very familiar smartwatch experience if you’ve delved into the world of Wear watches before. A lot has changed since the last Moto, but a lot of the issues that plagued Wear back then still persist today. Getting around still feels a little clunky and features like Google Assistant don’t really match the experience of using it on a phone or a smart speaker as far as reliability or usefulness are concerned.
While it might not look like it’s built for the gym, this watch has pretty much everything you need to workout with it. There’s built-in GPS including satellite support for Beidou and Gallileo systems to increase mapping coverage. There’s an optical heart rate monitor and 3ATM waterproofing means you can swim with it on, and has the ability to track your swimming with a suitable third party swim app.
The first thing you’ll need to do is swap in a different strap, because it’s clearly designed to get sweaty with and as mentioned, a sportier band is included. Once you’ve done that, its sports tracking skills pretty much fall in line with what we’ve found from other smartwatches that heavily rely on Google’s operating system. The GPS signal pick up for outdoor tracking can be sluggish at times and the heart rate monitor accuracy is iffy when you push it to its limits for some high intensity training.

If you’re banking on Google Fit to be the place to track and collate your workout data, be warned – it’s not the greatest to use. It just doesn’t feel that well optimised for the small surroundings of a smartwatch. If you have to track, we’d suggest opting for a third party fitness app instead.
Moto 360 (2019) Performance and battery life – More of the same
The new 360 has been brought it in line with what the current crop of Wear OS smartwatches can offer. That means you’re getting 8GB of storage, which is double what the last iteration packed. That’s accompanied by a beefed-up 1GB of RAM to help keep things running smoothly. Rounding things off is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 3100 processor. You’re essentially getting the best spec sheet Wear OS can offer right now.
In terms of day-to-day use this is a really nice smartwatch. Unlike some Wear OS watches that match the Moto’s internals, it’s definitely been a more pleasant experience. Swiping through screens wasn’t laggy and there weren’t any frustrating app loading times to contend with.
When it comes to the battery, the Moto 360 isn’t breaking new ground. There’s a 355mAh capacity battery that is designed to get you an entire day of play time with it. There is also a battery saver mode on board that kicks into gear when battery life hits critical status. At that point you’re stuck with a smartwatch that will only tell you the time.
In my experience the battery tended to make it through a day and would maybe stretch to a day and a half, so within the norm of most Wear watches. When you factor in using the GPS or having the display in always-on mode, that is inevitably going to impact on its staying power. You do of course have that battery saver mode, but you’re very restricted as far as what you can do in that mode.
On the plus side, it’s a snappy charger when you do go fully flat. The promise of getting back to 100% in an hour definitely rings true, and even a 20 or 30 minute charge does a good job of topping it up if you’ve forgotten to charge it overnight.

Should you buy the Moto 360 (2019)?
If you’re someone who loved the first Moto 360, then you might be sold on the idea of an updated version with upgraded internals that is overall much smarter than the last 360.
That being said, there’s nothing here that makes it stand out from the rest of the smartwatch crowd or betters the experience you’ll get from an Apple Watch or a Samsung smartwatch. This is not a best smartwatch, and it falls flat in a number of areas.
It’s expensive, and for the same price – or even less – you can own a smartwatch that looks nicer and offers pretty much the same features.
Verdict 
The Moto 360 isn’t quite the smartwatch comeback we hoped for. It’s decent enough, but there are certainly more exciting and better-looking options out there.

Verdict




























 



The Galaxy A90 5G is a very competent 5G phone that ticks all the right boxes when it comes to hardware and functionality. The design is a little bland, but it has all the graphical grunt you’ll need to play the most demanding games on Android and the screen remains one of the best you’ll find on a phone this price. The camera isn’t industry leading, but it’ll do the job for most people.



Pros

5G that won't break the bank
Excellent, big AMOLED screen



Cons

Design is a little bland
5G connectivity not available in most places






Key Specifications

Review Price: £669.00
6.7-inch 1080 x 2400 display
48MP camera
6/8GB RAM
4500mAh battery
5G


The Galaxy A90 5G is Samsung’s opening shot to make an “affordable” 5G smartphone that a regular person can actually afford.
But with pricing still set at well over £600 it’s still hardly in Moto G territory and sits in a fairly awkward segment of the market, and 5G is still a young technology that only works in select areas of the UK and contracts are currently extortionately expensive.
I personally can’t see why people willing to pay an arm and a leg for a 5G contract, despite its current shortcomings, would be concerned about saving a couple of hundred quid on their phone – but the Galaxy A90 5G is a competent device if not the best phone around.

Galaxy A90 5G design – A classic Samsung
Unlike the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 5G, the Galaxy A90 5G looks fairly similar to its vanilla 4G sibling of the same name. This means it’s nice looking, but far from unique.
It has a mixed metal and glass design, with slight curved sides on its back, a USB C charge port and speaker on its bottom and dew drop notch camera housing on its front.
It also features an under screen fingerprint scanner that works about as well as it does on the sea of other phones with the tech. Cliff notes: it works for the most part, but will struggle in even moderately damp/rainy conditions.
If that sounds familiar it should. The description could be paired to numerous other phones this year – honestly if you stripped the branding off I think a lot of people would struggle to tell the difference between the A90 5G and Huawei P30 from earlier this year.
The only design feature differentiating it from the competition is its atypical dual tone back, which I’m not a huge fan of.  I’m also not convinced it would survive an accidental encounter with a pavement crack free, but it does feel well made. This is also a concern I have with most 2019 flagships.
Thankfully, it does tick all the right boxes when it comes to functionality, however.

Galaxy A90 5G display – A typically excellent AMOLED screen
The 6.7-inch, FHD+ resolution, Super AMOLED display lives up to Samsung’s stellar track record with mobile screens. Powering it up colours instantly look full of life, without being overcooked. A fact backed up by its out of the box 6408 kelvin colour temperature, which is a hair’s breadth away from the 6500 kelvin ideal, I detected during testing.
The 0.00 black level means blacks are about as deep and inky as you’ll get on a phone. This plus the 363 nits max brightness I recorded means the video and games look wonderfully vibrant and offer a suitably immersive viewing/playing experience.
The only downside is that it’s colour gamut coverage isn’t up to snuff for serious creative work or photography. The 99.6% sRGB coverage is excellent, but 68.8% Adobe RGB and 71.1% DCIP3 coverage is a little on the low side. But, as I’ve said 100 times before, I can’t see this being too big a deal as no artist of photographer is going to want to do serious editing on a phone this size without a stylus. Even then mobile camera tech is too limited for even semi-professional purposes.

Galaxy A90 5G performance – 5G speeds that won’t break the bank
The key selling point of the phone is its 5G connectivity. Though, globally, there have been cheaper 5G phones, the £669 SIM-free price makes the Galaxy A90 5G one of the more affordable options for early adopters in the UK at the moment.
Powered by the same Qualcomm modem as the Galaxy S10 5G the phone’s data speeds are excellent, if you happen to wander into an area where the tech is actually running. This sounds cool, but be warned there are still on a very limited number of cities with active 5G networks. Even within them, the number of locations where you can actually get the connectivity is incredibly limited.
Using the Galaxy A90 5G I never once accidentally got 5G connectivity, the only time I got to enjoy it was when I intentionally headed to King’s Cross, an area where it’s active, to a spot I specifically knew had it. While it was nice to have a bonding moment with the other early adopters who where playing the same hunt the 5G signal game with their new phones I was, it does make me question if making the switch from 4G is worth it for most people at the moment.
Most industry forecasts suggest the tech’s not going to overtake 4G and become standard for around another two years, so be warned; if you’re going to make the jump now you will be a very, very early adopter.

Under the hood things are also pretty impressive. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU was flagship-level a few months ago and when paired with the phone’s 6/8GB RAM options is more than good enough for 3D gaming, lightweight photo touch up work and pretty much anything else you’d want to do on a smartphone.
During testing I never had any issue with the phone’s performance. The Galaxy A90 5G’s synthetic benchmark scores, which judge a phone’s performance by running it through a series of stress tests, mirrored my real world experience. You can see how it compares to the full fat Galaxy S10 below.

Galaxy A90 5G camera – It doesn’t match the Pixel 3a, but it’s still quite good
This phone continues Samsung’s 2019 run of making good, if not the best camera phones.
The A90 5G comes with a fairly by the numbers triple-sensor setup that combines 48-megapixel (main), 5-megapixel (depth) and 8-megapixel (ultra-wide) parts. The addition of an ultra-wide is a nice touch that’s much more useful than the telephoto third sensor you see on many competing phones. With real world use I found the snapper is more than good enough for most users. Photos taken with the main sensor in regular light looks sharp enough, have decent contrast and aren’t overly sharpened.
The only minor quibble I have is that the 12-megapixel shots taken on the main snapper can look a little over-processed. This is particularly noticeable in landscape and cityscape shots, but this is an issue that’s common to Samsung phones and a touch some people actually like. I’m just not a big fan personally.
Portrait shots are also fine. Photos taken in the portrait mode feature reasonably realistic bokeh effects, where the foreground is in focus while the background is blurred. The only time you’ll have issues is if you blow up the photos on a big screen. Here, like all phones, you’ll notice some blurring and anomalies around the foreground subject matter’s edges.
Low light is the only area the A90 5G seriously lags behind. It is capable of taking better low light shots than many “mid-range” phones, but it fails to match the quality of the Pixel 3a and Huawei P30. Low light photos are usable for sharing on social media, but they look noisier and slightly less polished than those taken on the Pixel and Huawei.
It’s a similar story with the 32-megapixel front camera. The camera is good enough for snapping selfies in regular light and taking and making video calls, but image quality rapidly drops in dim conditions.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the Galaxy A90 5G below.

The phone’s giant 4500mAh battery is on paper excellent and one of the biggest you’ll find on a mainstream smartphone. With regular use the Galaxy A90 5G’s battery life is reasonably good.
Using the A90 5G as my main work and personal phone I generally got a full day’s use out of it. This entailed listening to music on my morning workout and commute to and from work, checking and responding to incoming emails and messages throughout the day, sporadic web browsing, the odd game of PUBG and an hour or two’s video streaming in the evening.
It also dealt with demanding processes ok. Video streaming with the screen set to 150 nits brightness, the level most people will feel comfortable, the phone discharged an average of 5-9% of its charge, which is solid by today’s standards. Gaming told a similar story, with the A90 5G discharging around 12-15% of its charge per hour.
But things get a little dicier if you take advantage of its key selling point, 5G. Downloading series from Netflix with an active 5G connection I saw the battery take a huge hit and it eeked through 8% of its charge in 15 minutes.

Should you buy the Galaxy A90 5G?
The Galaxy A90 5G is a very competent 5G phone that ticks all the right boxes when it comes to hardware and functionality. The design is a little bland, but it has all the graphical grunt you’ll need to play the most demanding games on Android and the screen remains one of the best you’ll find on a phone this price. The camera isn’t industry leading, but it’ll do the job for most people.
But it isn’t hardware that’s holding the phone back. 5G is still a very young technology that only works in a select number of areas. This plus the hefty upfront cost of 5G contracts makes me question if there is a market for mid-range 5G phones at the moment. The Galaxy A90 5G feel a little ahead of its time as a result.

Verdict




























 



A very good affordable phone that outguns most of the opposition with its exemplary hardware, if not its software.



Pros

Excellent performance
Vibrant Super AMOLED display
Strong all-round camera



Cons

ColorOS is a little heavy-handed
Macro camera feels superfluous






Key Specifications

Review Price: €299
6.4in Super AMOLED display
Android 9.0 Pie with ColorOS 6
Four cameras on the back
Including 64-megapixel sensor
Snapdragon 730G CPU with 8GB of RAM
158.7 x 75.2 x 8.6mm
In-display fingerprint sensor
Headphone port



While the Realme X2 Pro is attracting warranted attention for its OnePlus-baiting combination of price and performance, it’s worth remembering that there was a second Realme X2 announced back in October.
Available now in selected European markets for just €299 (around £260), the Realme X2 packs in some compellingly proficient components for a third of the price of a fully specced flagship. On paper at least, it’s a bit of a steal.
You’re looking at a phone that boasts a vibrant Super AMOLED display, a pixel-packed quad-camera, strong mid-range performance, and several design flourishes that mark it out from the affordable crowd.
And it really needs to stand out, with the likes of the Nokia 7.2, the Motorola One Vision and the Sony Xperia 10 all competing within the same aspirational sub-€300 bracket.
Realme X2 design – Tidily generic but for the fingerprint sensor
The low to middle section of the smartphone market is no place for design innovation, and it’s no surprise that the Realme X2 comes across as a mish-mash of a bunch of other phones.
From the front, it could be any smartphone from Xiaomi, Nokia, Motorola, or countless other brands. It has a familiar dewdrop notch and a dominant screen, with an impressive 91.9% screen-to-body ratio.
From the rear there are hints of Xiaomi and Honor from the X2’s tone-shifting blue and purple shiny finish, while the lozenge-shaped camera module is firmly in the iPhone X school.
This isn’t a criticism so much as an observation – almost everyone is drawing from the same limited design playbook at this end of the market. What’s important is that the X2 looks tidy –  and that it feels good in the hand.
The Realme X2 is well balanced and solid, with minimal flex or creak despite its plastic frame. The shiny Gorilla Glass 5-coated rear and glossy plastic sides aren’t to my taste, and the former is a serial fingerprint offender. Nevertheless, there’s nothing here that deserves singling out for serious criticism.

In fact, there are a couple of inclusions that warrant praise. The provision of a headphone jack and a USB-C port aren’t especially noteworthy at this price, but they’re good things to tick off the list. More noteworthy is the inclusion of an in-display fingerprint sensor, rather than the usual rear-mounted component.
The remaining hardware buttons are nicely spread out and well positioned, with the power button sitting two-thirds of the way up the right-hand edge and the volume keys dead opposite. A lot of manufacturers cram all of them onto one edge, but I prefer this more evenly distributed approach.
There’s only get a single speaker on the bottom of the phone, but it’s plenty loud and clear enough. A full-on stereo setup would have been nice of course, but that’s well above the Realme X2’s pay grade.
Realme X2 display – Vibrant Super AMOLED at a bargain price
You can’t really afford to include a bad or even mediocre display if you’re asking people to pay €300 for a phone. The competition has grown too strong, even down here.
The likes of the Sony Xperia 10, the Motorola One Action and the Nokia 7.2 all come with large, crisp Full HD+ efforts. All have attention-grabbing features, too, whether it’s an ultra-wide 21:9 aspect ratio or claims of HDR compatibility.
Thankfully, the Realme X2 has something of a trump card in its 6.4in Super AMOLED display. The screen’s 1080 x 2340 resolution ensures that everything is sufficiently sharp, but it’s the provision of that Super AMOLED panel that really stands out. It provides an uncommonly vibrant picture, with the kind of alluringly deep blacks that those predominantly LCD rivals can’t hope to match.
You can currently get the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE with a Super AMOLED display for a similar amount of money, but that’s only due to the typical level of discounting from its £349 RRP.

I found the Realme X2 display to be perhaps a little cool by default, but there’s a no-nonsense slider in the Settings menu that lets you warm things up with minimum fuss.
All in all, this is an uncommonly rich, vibrant display for the money. Heavy video-watchers will have to put up with an intrusive dewdrop notch, but this isn’t unusual to find even further up the smartphone hierarchy. Otherwise, I can’t think of many phones that pack such a visual punch for the price.
Realme X2 performance – Punches well above its weight
Just as the Realme X2’s display feels like it’s been airlifted in from a slightly more expensive phone, so does its CPU and RAM combo. The Snapdragon 730G at the heart of the device is Qualcomm’s current mid-range provision, built to an efficient 8nm standard.
It’s the same chip that is in the Oppo Reno 2, a handset that costs around £200 more. We were impressed with that phone’s mid-range power, although there were better performers at the price. That caveat doesn’t apply here.
General navigation is fluid, while jumping between multiple open apps was notable for the absence of loading – something that’s no doubt helped by the generous provision of 8GB of RAM.
Even intensive 3D games such as Call of Duty Mobile and PUBG run fluidly on high settings – or even Very High in the case of CoD. Indeed, the Snapdragon 730G is specifically geared towards such gaming tasks, with a GPU that’s been clocked 15% higher than the Plain Snapdragon 730.
A Geekbench 4 multi-core score of 6833 drives home the point that the Realme X2 is a very good performer. Comparing that to its contemporaries, the Motorola One Action scored 5123 and the Nokia 7.2 scored 5889; not even close.
You’ll have ample storage for downloading those aforementioned games and apps, too, with 128GB and a microSD slot. This really is a very well-equipped phone.

Realme X2 software – ColorOS 6.1 has us pining for stock Android
The Realme X2 runs Android 9.0 Pie with Oppo’s ColorOS 6.1 interface layered over the top. It’s another of those custom UIs that seems a little over-eager to differentiate itself. File next to Huawei’s Emotion UI and Xiaomi’s MIUI.
On the face of it, this is a fairly typical derivation of Google’s popular mobile OS. The homescreens look roughly the same, as do the (mostly) circular app icons and the drag-up app tray.
But the notification menu looks quite different, with a more cluttered and confusing layout – although it’s nice to be able to access the screen brightness from the initial drag-down phase. I found the Settings menu to be equally jumbled, especially if you’re coming from a more stock-like Android experience.
Scrolling to the left of the main homescreen, meanwhile, brings up a custom Smart Assistant where you might hope to find Google’s ever-useful feed. Here you get a bunch of contextual widgets, including a calendar, a local weather readout, quick app and contact shortcuts, step trackers, and recently taken photos.
It isn’t entirely without use, although most Android users will already have their own ways of accessing this information in a jiffy. Android has had widget support for years, for example.
Perhaps most objectionable is the suite of preinstalled apps forced upon you. Do we really need Opera browser out of the box when Chrome is already installed? Do we need AquaMail when Gmail is already present? The answer is no and certainly no respectively.
ColorOS 6.1 is far from an unusable travesty. It has the good sense to go about its business speedily and without unnecessary animations. But after an impressive hardware showing, this is the one area where Android One rivals such as the Nokia 7.2 and Motorola One Vision claw back a significant victory.
Realme X2 camera – Generally accomplished results
If you’re an affordable phone pretending to be a higher grade of device then it’s usually with the camera that you’ll come unstuck. But the Realme X2 offers a pretty decent photographic package.
Claims that it’s a quad camera are ever so slightly disingenuous, if technically accurate. One of the lenses here is for a 2-megapixel macro camera for getting extremely up-close and personal (Realme says 4cm), while another is a dedicated depth sensor. That leaves just the two “proper” cameras.
They’re pretty well equipped, though. The main camera is a 64-megapixel unit with a large 1/1.72in sensor and a bright f/1.8 aperture. Most shots you take will actually be captured at 16 megapixels, but it’s possible to force the camera to use the full 64 if you intend to really blow up those images.
That’s backed by an 8-megapixel f/2.3 ultra wide-angle secondary, which offers a 119-degree field of view.
This quad setup combines effectively to capture pleasingly vibrant, balanced images for the most part. I was also impressed by the quality of the low-light indoors shots captured, which weren’t washed out in the way that results from many cheaper smartphone cameras tend to be. You can probably thank that large sensor.
There’s a dedicated Night mode (here called Super Nightscape 2.0), which forms the usual composite image of multiple frames. It’s far from the best example out there, but it does draw out a fair amount of extra detail in very dark situations – provided you can hold still for a second.
Meanwhile, the aforementioned depth sensor seems to justify its existence with a decent Portrait mode, which can really make a subject pop without looking too false or glitchy around the edges. Again, far from a given at this end of the market.
You may have noted the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens here, but Realme has combined the X2’s resources to produce usable – if far from perfect – 2x zoom shots. The ultra-cropped 5x option seems to be a step too far, though, with bags-full of noise.
There’s an unusually sharp 32-megapixel camera around front, whose results aren’t anything special. Realme is promising a Portrait Super Nightscape selfie mode in a future update, though.
Video shooters get the ability to capture 960fps slow-motion video, and there’s Ultra Image Stabilisation (UIS) that effectively steadies the picture electronically at the expense of a little cropping.
The auto-HDR is on point, with little in the way of overexposure

There’s no telephoto, but 2X shots can look pretty good
General shots are pretty crisp and balanced
Night mode draws out a lot of detail from both foreground and background
Without Night mode things look a little mushy and indistinct

Realme X2 battery life – Top stamina, impressively rapid charging
The Realme X2 completes a clean sweep of impressive hardware with a sizable 4000mAh battery and impressively rapid 30W charging.
Not that you’ll find yourself needing to top up so urgently on many occasions. I found myself going through a long day of moderate to heavy usage with 35-40% left in the tank.
Related: Best budget phones

It’s quite conceivable that light users will be able to go through two days in-between charges.
An hour of streamed Netflix, with the screen brightness cranked up to full, takes 7% off the battery. That’s pretty decent.
And when it does come time to recharge, there’s that 30W VOOC Flash Charge 4.0 charger. Realme claims it can carry the X2 to 67% in just 30 minutes.
In a testing scenario that’s possibly more reflective of real-life, I found I was able to get from 59% to 84% – an increase of 25% – in just 15 minutes. Impressive stuff.
Should you buy the Realme X2?
The Realme X2 offers a compelling package for less than €300. In particular, the phone’s hardware is uniformly strong, offering excellent performance, a vibrant Super AMOLED display and strong battery life.
You’re also getting a flexible camera that can take punchy, well-balanced shots in a range of lighting conditions. This isn’t something you always see at this end of the market.
The main thing that holds the Realme X2 back from an unqualified recommendation is its sub-par ColorOS custom UI – but even that’s pretty solid and possible to adapt to.

Key Specifications

Review Price: £474
108-megapixel main camera
5 cameras on the back, including a 2x and 5x
6GB RAM, Snapdragon 730
128GB storage
Headphone jack
5260mAh battery
6.47in OLED display, FHD+


The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 is a mid-range phone with some high-end device design traits. It has more cameras than sense and an expensive-looking, curved-glass front.
A 108-megapixel camera and massive 5260mAh battery are headline numbers that are sure to attract some attention.
This isn’t quite the world-beater you might expect in other respects, however. Its camera is slow; there are some day-to-day issues that make it seem more sluggish than it is. And while the battery is sizeable and lasts okay, you might expect even better stamina for its spec.
There’s still plenty to like here, but the cheaper Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro and Oppo Reno 2 may be a better choice for some.
Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Price
The Mi Note 10 isn’t officially on sale in the UK or USA yet. However, it’s available for as low as £333 from sites like Gearbest (RRP £474).

Xiaomi Mi Note 10 design – A almost-premium look, but the fingerprint scanner is hit and miss
In some areas, the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 is made to the same standard as a phone costing twice the price. Its sides are metal, and both the front and rear of the device are substantial, curved pieces of glass. There’s no plastic border sitting between the metal and glass either, which is highly unusual for a phone costing less than £600.
This invites comparisons to handsets such as the Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10, both of which are more expensive. But it’s the camera housing found on the rear of the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 that you may well notice first.

It’s huge and protrudes, noticeably so considering the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 isn’t an ultra-slim handset to start. Xiaomi has a good excuse: the phone’s battery is significant in size. But what I get from the Mi Note 10’s design is that it’s a phone that’s made to wear a coat – the silicone case that comes in the box.
In fact, the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 feels almost incomplete without its silicone case, which smooths out the carbuncle of camera.

If you want a phone that looks and feels super-expensive at around £400, the Oppo Reno 2 arguably pulls this off better than the Mi Note 10. Oppo has made that handset attractive whether in or out of a case.
The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 is all about the curves, although it’s a shame then that in the case you’re unlikely to really get to appreciate them. Note, too, that the Mi Note 10 doesn’t offer any water-resistance. This is the norm at the price, but again reminds that similarity to phones double the price is actually somewhat thin.

The handset’s in-screen fingerprint scanner isn’t nearly as good as those of top-end phones, either. Picky about finger placement, highly sensitive to moisture and prone to mis-reading a perfectly good imprint, you might resort to using face unlock instead. As in-screen scanners become more common in mid-range phones, slightly dodgy units such as this are now quite common.
Its performance dipped over the course of a week or so. While it improved a little after re-training the scanner to recognise my finger, it’s still far from ideal. The fact that rear and side finger scanners have been largely excellent for years now makes it the unit here all the more annoying.
That’s enough negativity for now, though. The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 feels better than any Samsung phone at the price, and you don’t get a curved front with the Oppo Reno 2.
The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 also has an IR blaster. It enables the Mi Remote app, which lets the phone act as a universal remote, sending out the same commands as your TV remote (as long as it isn’t a flashy Bluetooth one).

Xiaomi Mi Note 10 screen – An OLED panel and all the benefits this brings
A motorised front camera is the most obvious feature lacking in the Xiaomi Mi Note 10. Xiaomi includes these in other phones, but here we get a more conventional teardrop notch.
The inclusion of the former would have made the Mi Note 10 the full package – a curved front, undisturbed by notches. But even the hyper-aggressive Xiaomi has to establish a limit.
The Mi Note 10 has a 6.47in screen, an OLED panel with a 2340 x 1080 pixel resolution. It’s an excellent screen for the money. You may find larger, but you won’t find much better, particularly if the curvy front appeals.

Not had a phone with an OLED panel before? They offer unparalleled contrast and super-deep colour. You can choose between a super-saturated or more natural colour profile, or one that changes the screen character based on ambient lighting.
With the Mi Note 10, I’ve had no trouble at all with the auto brightness setting – which can be an issue on less well-optimised phones. Plus, there’s enough brightness – a claimed 600 nits – to get by comfortably on brighter days.
However, the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 does seem to have an odd bug that makes the screen flash bright for a fraction of a second when unlocking. It isn’t catastrophic; more disconcerting.
The screen is sharp, bold and rich, and it supports 1080p Netflix. HDR support is here, too – and, not surprisingly, looks excellent in a room with controlled lighting that lets you appreciate the brightness of the display.
How do rivals at the price compare? The Samsung Galaxy A70 screen is of an even more generous size, and the Reno 2’s is effectively larger for movies since it doesn’t have a notch.

Xiaomi Mi Note 10 software – The lack of an app drawer disappoints
The Mi Note 10 runs Android 9 with Xiaomi’s MIUI interface. Its visual style is similar to that of Huawei; it’s not as rounded as Samsung, and not as stiffly sharp as Oppo’s.
I have no real issues with the software’s looks, but customisation is limited in one important respect. There’s no app drawer in MIUI. Any apps you install end up on homescreens – and, unlike Huawei’s UI, there’s no option to add a dedicated app area.
The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has an extra homescreen packed with widget-like shortcuts to Xiaomi apps and tools. It’s just as useful as it sounds (not very), and I’ve ignored it almost entirely when actually using the phone. You probably will too.

Personally, the lack of a proper app screen bumps MIUI down to the lower rungs of Android interfaces for me. But if you’re not similarly attached to one, the Mi Note 10’s software is perfectly fine.
Xiaomi Mi Note 10 performance – It isn’t the fastest, but it’s a decent performer
A mid-range processor, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G, beats at the heart of the Mi Note 10. It’s the same chipset that comes in the Oppo Reno 2; Samsung’s Galaxy A80 has the similar Snapdragon 730. This “G” version simply has higher-clocked graphics hardware for slightly better performance in games.
In practice, this works well. You can play Ark: Survival Evolved comfortably at High graphics, with the resolution slider set at around 70%. PUBG runs well maxed-out – just turn on anti-aliasing to get rid of the jaggies.

Day-to-day performance is technically sound, as you’d hope from a device with a good CPU and 6GB of RAM. However, it ends up feeling flaky thanks to a slightly unreliable fingerprint scanner and the odd screen-flash unlock effect mentioned in the display part of this review.
The Mi Note 10 also isn’t the fastest phone you can get from Xiaomi at the price. Its Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro costs less but has a far more powerful Snapdragon 855.
According to Geekbench 4 and 3D Mark, that phone has around 70% more CPU power and well over twice the GPU power.
Xiaomi Mi Note 10 camera – Punchy and engaging images that will have you taking more
The camera is where you’ll discover the Xiaomi Mi Note 10’s most significant performance issues. It’s slow.
There’s shutter lag of around half a second, and the processing of images takes a very long time. The reason becomes clear on taking a closer look at the tech inside.

The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has a 108-megapixel main camera, which uses pixel binning to output 27-megapixel images. You could argue this is better thought of as a 27-megapixel camera then, since the Samsung S5KHMX sensor is primarily designed to shoot at that resolution, and actually uses an algorithm to shoot 108MP images that sound like its natural output.
Either way, there’s a lot of data to process in each image. 108-megapixel shots end up at around 35MB each.
Normal shots are packed full of detail; 108-megapixel shots even more so. There’s a slight painterly quality to those ultra-high-res images, common to “AI” algorithm-assisted shots. However, I’m impressed by how natural they continue to look, and how different they are to the 27-megapixel images.
The character of the images relies on fairly high contrast, with rich colour. It’s a high-energy look, not a neutral one. But shots taken with the Mi Note 10 are consistently punchy and engaging.
The camera is also unusually good at dealing with the light levels of tricky scenes such as sunsets, and tends to overexpose sky-free nature scenes less than most mid-range phone cameras I’ve used in 2019.
 
The Mi Note 10’s 108-megapixel images tend to display significantly more purple colour noise than 27-megapixel pictures. However, this sort of makes sense when you consider that combining pixels should theoretically increase its ability to weed such distortion. In addition, I only noticed the purple haze when zooming in to the images.
I’m also impressed by most of the other cameras that feature on the Mi Note 10’s rear. There’s a 2x zoom, a 3x zoom lens the phone crops into for 5x images, an ultra-wide and a dedicated macro.
The macro sensor is the only real “dud”. I took a trip to the park with the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 during testing to see whether it takes close-ups better than the 5x zoom or 108-megapixel modes. In almost all situations I was able to get better results from the other cameras, cropping to get close.
Close-up focusing is the main benefit of the macro camera. And, unlike many of these mini-macros, it does have autofocus. However, since the sensor is a piddly 2-megapixel resolution, it can’t actually render much detail, even with perfect focus.
 
You get the finest of macro-like detail using the main camera
It works for remedial macro shots, where you want to get close and have a fairly shallow depth of field. But for actual macro-level detail capture, it’s a bust.
The zoom results are much better. Most mid-range phones take poor pictures at 5x. The Mi Note 10 takes good ones, even if it does “cheat” and crop into a 3x zoom, 8-megapixel sensor to achieve them. It feels like a real native zoom, without the digital obfuscation of zoom-by-processing. I find this makes the camera more fun to use, and helps offset the frustration of its lethargic feel.

Its ultra-wide 20-megapixel camera is similar. You don’t see the quality drop-off of some mid-range phones, and so you’ll end up using it more.
Night image quality is a slightly mixed affair. Shoot using the auto mode and the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 takes slightly vague-looking low-light images. Texture detail increases hugely when you use the Night mode, and the shadows are lifted significantly for a less dark-looking image. They’re not as good as the Pixel 3a XL‘s night shots, but they’re good enough.

And after all the complaints about speed, Night mode doesn’t take that long to shoot – just a couple of seconds. There’s still a wait for processing after the shoot, but it’s the exposure capture that actually stops you going about your business.
 
The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 doesn’t remotely mine the capability of the 108-megapixel sensor for video. Samsung says it’s capable of 6K video capture, but the phone taps out at 4K, 30 frames per second. Why? It’s the hard limit of the Snapdragon 730G processor, according to Qualcomm.
Xiaomi has made surprisingly good use of this 108-megapixel sensor, but we’ll likely see it exploited even further in other phones.
However, video versatility is otherwise great, as you can shoot using any of the cameras. And since the 2x and 5x views both have optical stabilisation, they’re genuinely usable.
There’s one more slightly pedantic point to make here. What is the point of having 2x and 3x zoom lenses in a phone that also has a 108-megapixel 1x camera? Smarter use of software could remove the need for one of these cameras.

Xiaomi Mi Note 10 battery life – Generous capacity that will easily outlast rivals
The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has what sounds like a ridiculously large battery – it has a 5260mAh capacity. This is huge for any phone, particularly one with a 1080p 6.47in screen.
The battery lasts well, although in my experience it didn’t come close to the Oppo A9 2020 I tested recently. The level of power remaining by the end of the day fluctuates between 30% and 50%; it’s enough to give those who abuse their phones all-day comfort. But on hearing that the Mi Note 10 has a 5260mAh capacity battery, you might expect two days of solid use between each charge.
While this isn’s something I saw, the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 still comfortably outlasts most handsets, including many of those in the £800-1000 price bracket.

Should I buy the Xiaomi Mi Note 10?
The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 is a good phone that, like most Xiaomi handsets, is attractively priced. The quality of the hardware included for the money is good – or much better in the case of the camera lineup. The main 108-megapixel camera impresses, as does the quality of its zoom images.
However, this handset is lacking a degree of polish. The camera is slow, it isn’t the most attractive of phone despite all that curved glass, and the fingerprint scanner performance is poor.
Nevertheless, despite all its flaws the Mi Note 10 is still a good-value phone that offers similar photo composition flexibility as the Huawei P30 Pro.

Amazon’s latest cheap-as-chips Fire 7 tablet is, once again, a slate designed almost solely for the consumption of Amazon content. Books, TV shows or audiobooks – the Fire 7 gives you a direct line to all that Prime has to offer.
If you want a tablet for the basics and aren’t willing to spend a penny more then the Fire 7 should get the job done. 
It might not have the specs to match some of the best tablets (or even the best budget tablets) around – but it offers a tempting prospect nevertheless. 
Design – The Amazon Fire 7 is a rugged, plastic tablet that can take a beating
The Amazon Fire 7 is about as far away from the iPad Pro and Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 as it’s possible to get. Considering this tablet costs a penny under £50 (and one cent under $50 in the States), this should hardly come as a surprise, but you might be shocked at just how budget this slate feels the first time you pick it up. 
It’s built completely out of plastic, with buttons that feel a bit mushy and a rear casing that seems like it should pop off completely. It’s basic, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. You won’t worry about this tablet getting scratched in your bag, or about giving to your kids.
The Fire 7 comes in Plum (pictured), Black, Sage and Blue
Because of its plastic construction, it’s also very light and can be comfortably held in one hand for reading.
 As the name suggests, the Amazon Fire 7 has a 7-inch display. This makes it Amazon’s smallest tablet and among the dinkiest we’ve reviewed. With its slim 16:9 display, it’s a lot narrower than the 7.9-inch iPad Mini and it was small enough to slip into the pocket of one of my larger coats.
 All the ports and physical controls are on the top – which is a bit odd until you get used to it – and comprise a 3.5mm headphone jack, micro USB port for charging, volume rocker and lock switch. As USB-C is so common now, it irks me that Amazon is sticking with the tired older style. However, if you’re someone with a bunch of micro USB cables lying around, you probably won’t find it so much of a nuisance.
Screen – If there’s a clear weakness with the Amazon Fire 7 it’s the fairly poor display
Sacrifices are always going to be made to sell a tablet at £50/$50, and it’s obvious where corners have been cut here: the display. The 7-inch IPS (In Plane Switching) panel is colourful and bright, but the low 1024 x 600 resolution is very obvious and it makes everything from watching films to browsing the web a bit of a chore. Pixels are always noticeable and text is very jagged – not ideal for a device that’s marketed as an e-reader. 
Text is far from crisp
How much this bothers you will depend on how much you value a clean, crisp image. If, like me, you prefer pixels to blend into each other, I would suggest spending a bit more and going for one of the Fire HD tablets instead.
Software and Alexa – If you’re big into Amazon Prime, the Fire 7 will bring all your media and books together
The software that runs on Amazon’s Fire line is the definition of love it or hate it. Every aspect is designed to funnel you towards some sort of content supplied by Amazon, whether it’s a Prime video or a piece of clothing you looked at two weeks ago.
If you’re not a Prime member then I don’t think this is the tablet for you – even at such a low price. Other apps, like Netflix, are available, but the home screens are designed to push Amazon’s own stuff right to the front. At times, it can feel like you’re in a constant advert.
There are also adverts (or Special Offers, as Amazon likes to call them) on the lock screen. These mainly comprise book suggestions, which are fine and can be disabled by paying an extra £10/$15.
If you are deeply entrenched in the Amazon ecosystem then the overall software UI is great at quickly delivering content. Prime Video, Kindle books, Audible audiobooks and apps from Amazon’s well-stocked Appstore are all easily available, alongside other handy features, like X-Ray in video playback and the ability to flip between a Kindle book and an audiobook. 
I’m a fan of the For You home screen panel in particular. This is an area where you’ll get quick access to your recently read books and watched films, all combined into a handy, scrollable list. 
Amazon content is everywhere
As with previous Amazon tablets, the Fire 7 runs a forked version of Google’s Android. Android remains the basis of the OS, but there’s no visible mention of this and there’s no support for popular services like YouTube, Gmail or the Google Play Store. Instead, Amazon has its own app store and native apps for email and web browsing, which are far from Google’s level – if you’re a big user of the search engine giant’s services, you’d be better off with a tablet that runs a proper version of Android.
One feature the Fire 7 has over other Android tablets is deep integration of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant. While previous versions of the Fire 7 had Alexa, this is the first to go hands-free, meaning you don’t need to press a button to bring Alexa to life. Instead, just say “Alexa” in the same way you would with an Echo or Echo Dot. 
You can use Alexa to control your smart home (“Alexa, turn off the bedroom lights”), play music and just about everything else you can do on the Echo Show. 
Performance – The Fire 7’s performance is acceptable, even if the cameras are forgettable 
The Amazon Fire 7 isn’t the tablet for intense gaming sessions or picture editing, and nothing makes that clearer than the fairly low-end internals. There’s a mere 1GB RAM, paired with a 1.3Ghz processor. That amount of RAM stands out as being particularly low and you’ll notice it when jumping between apps.
There’s a lag and judder when opening apps that you don’t get with pricier tablets. However, and again I come back to the price, I can forgive that when it’s only £50.
You’ll notice lag when gaming, too, but basic things like browsing and email are a lot smoother. 
There are two cameras on the Fire 7: one on the front, which caps out at 720p video, and another on the back, which is 2 megapixels. Neither are very good and, to be completely honest, I would be all for ditching the cameras completely (or at least the rear one) if it allowed Amazon to add a bit more RAM. The camera is slow to focus and shoot, it struggles when the light isn’t bright and generally will be beaten by any phone you’ve got in your pocket.
Battery life – A decent performer
Amazon states that you should expect seven hours of reading, browsing and media watching. From my weeks using the device on a daily basis, I feel these claims are correct and I tended to charge the tablet every couple of days. If you only use it for, say, half an hour of reading every day, you’ll probably get a week between charges.
All the ports are along the top
Charging the tablet fully takes roughly two hours with the included power brick. However, it’ll take much longer if you plug it into a laptop to charge (this is something you might be familiar with doing if you’re a Kindle owner). Amazon has also stuck with the micro USB port, rather than switching to the newer USB-C alternative.
Should I buy the Amazon Fire 7?
The Fire 7 remains a budget tablet that, while far from perfect, is hard to really criticise for the £50/$50 price. If you want a cheap slate to watch movies on long flights or give to the kids without worrying about it getting damaged, this is a strong pick.
There are shortcoming and sacrifices, of course: the display is poor, cameras terrible and the meagre 1GB RAM makes itself known a little too often. But when you consider that the cheapest iPad costs over six times the price of the Fire 7, these negatives are a little easier to swallow.
If you’re a Prime subscriber who wants a cheap way to access that goodness, this is a good choice. If you care even slightly about display or performance, however, pay a little more and get the Fire HD 8.

FAQs
Does Amazon Fire 7 have YouTube? Amazon’s tablets don’t have a YouTube app available through the app store. However you can watch through the browser.  Does Amazon Fire 7 have Bluetooth? Yes, the Fire 7 has Bluetooth.  Does Amazon Fire 7 tablet use sim card? No, there is no cellular connectivity on the Fire 7 or any other Fire tablet. You’ll need Wi-Fi to access the internet.  Can Amazon Fire 7 play Roblox? There is a Roblox app available to download on the Fire TV through the Amazon App Store.

Verdict




 



The Honor 9X is a solid all-rounder that will satisfy most people's needs. The high-resolution camera produces good images, performance is strong, and the battery life exceptional. But until the Android ban is resolved, Trusted Reviews can't recommend the device.



Pros

Excellent battery life
Good camera
Strong performance



Cons

No IP rating
No NFC






Key Specifications

6.59-inch LCD Screen (1080 x 2340)
64-megapixel main camera
8-megapixel ultra wide lens
2-megapixel depth sensor
Kirin 710 chipset



What is the Honor 9X?
Huawei’s sub-brand has established a strong reputation for hard-hitting budget devices that punch above their weight, such as the Honor 8X and Honor 10.
It has sought to reproduce this form with the Honor 9X, which boasts three cameras and a notchless screen. But how does it perform?
Honor 9X design – The USB-C port is a welcome addition
The Honor 9X has a shimmering tiled diamond design across the rear panel, dancing in the light to form the shape of an X. It’s certainly a distinctive look, although some might find it gaudy rather than beguiling.
Related: Best budget phones

Taken in the hand, it feels quite chunky, and there’s a reason for that: it’s a full millimetre thicker than its predecessor (8.8mm vs 7.8mm). In addition, the rear panel feels like glossy plastic to the touch; no cool-to-the-touch metal sides of the Honor 8X that lent that phone a touch of class.
As for the more practical parts of the design, the USB-C port is a welcome upgrade – and, fortunately the 3.5mm headphone jack ensures flexibility between wired and wireless listening options. You can unlock the device quickly via the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner.
Overall the look and physical feel of the Honor 8X was preferable, but the addition of USB-C is a clear upgrade in favour of the 9X.
Honor 9X camera – Images display decent colours and clarity
The headlining 48-megapixel sensor has won this handset plenty of attention, and the hype is pretty well justified.
The high-resolution sensor does deliver a good amount of detail and, fortunately, it doesn’t go down the route of the over-saturated images seen from some budget phones looking to overcompensate for their deficiencies.
Honor 9X: Main Camera
We’d reported some difficulty with the focus of the camera on the Honor 8X. Luckily, there have been no such issues with this device so far.
Honor 9X: Main camera
The camera app easily switches between the main camera lens and the 8-megapixel, 120-degree wide-angle lens. This promises a good level of versatility, similar in conception to the iPhone 11‘s combination of main camera and wide-angle lens — although, of course, it’s unreasonable to expect it to reach the same standards of quality.

Wide Angle Camera (left) / Main Camera (right)
These wide-angle images also look good, with clear colours and a decent amount of detail. When you’re actually taking the pictures, the on-screen viewfinder shows hideous distortion at the edges comparable to a fish-eye effect, which is a little off-putting. Fortunately, this warping isn’t evident in the final image.
Honor 9X: Portrait mode
The third lens on the rear of the device is a 2-megapixel-depth sensor entirely dedicated to improving portrait images. However, faces can still be a little blurred around the edges rather than cut cleanly from the background.
The effect still works passably for the most part and, for instance, the detail in hair is well represented. Importantly, it accurately rejects other faces in the background of the shot, rather than applying the same effect to them.

Honor 9X Night Mode: Off (left) / On (right)
The Honor 9X has a Night mode that, unlike rivals, doesn’t require a long waiting-time for results. It does reduce noise and increase the sharpness of images, although definitely not to the extent of its Pixel 3a mid-range rival.
Selfies aren’t all that sharp when compared to the main rear cameras. Plus, there’s an audible mechanical sound when the pop-up snapper is summoned. Nevertheless, the images remain presentable.
Honor 9X screen – A notch-free display, with a high screen-to-body ratio
This device offers a Full HD+ display and boasts a 91% screen-to-body ratio – two specifications that are impressive enough on their own. But the clinching factor for many buyers is likely to be the notch-free display, which means the screen is uninterrupted by intrusive selfie cameras and full-screen content such as videos and games are unblemished.
The pop-up camera solution isn’t new, having been shown off by the OnePlus 7T Pro, but it’s somewhat of a novelty to find it in the budget section of the mobiles market.

At 1080p, the resolution is unchanged from the Honor 8X. There’s no “wow” factor that hits you when the display first lights up, but it’s a decent enough, clear screen on which to watch videos.
You’ll only notice the downgrade if you’re used to a higher resolution screen. Otherwise, you probably won’t feel the difference. Being an LCD, it doesn’t offer quite the same deep contrast of the best OLED displays.
The screen quality itself isn’t a key selling point, but the notchless design with a high screen-to-body ratio will no doubt attract people who want a genuine full-screen experience on their phone.
Honor 9X battery life – Enough stamina to easily last a full day
The battery packed inside the Honor 9X is a 4000mAh unit, which will keep you going for quite some time. After half an hour of watching YouTube videos, I was amazed to see that the battery still remained at 100%. The battery will easily last you through the day, and then some. This is a great result for any handset; essentially it has a flagship battery capacity but with a processor and screen that are less demanding, so you can squeeze even more life from it.
Honor 9X performance – Powerful for the price
The Kirin 710 chipset also performs well. Whether powering through day-to-day tasks or running more intensely demanding games, we found no hint of lag or sluggishness.
This might well be due to the GPU Turbo 3.0 feature, which augments performance whilst gaming. It should be able to handle most tasks you throw at it, and is accompanied by 6GB of RAM – which should be capable of effective multi-tasking.
Each of the benchmark tests below assess a different aspect of the phone’s performance, with Geekbench focused on the CPU, 3-D Mark on the GPU, and Antutu putting the whole system through its paces. These scores pale in comparison to the best flagship phones around, but everyday performance on the 9X nonetheless was found to be good.
Benchmark Scores

Geekbench 5 Single Core: 322
Geekbench 5 Multi-Core: 1342
Antutu Score: 176,298
3-D Mark Slingshot Score: 1,127

Honor 9X software – Google apps still present, but for how long?
The Honor 9X does still have Google apps, despite the recent Android ban for parent company Huawei. In fact, it may be the very last device from the company to do so, since it just managed to get certified by Google before the shutters came down firmly. However, the ongoing saga means it’s harder to recommend this phone.
It still has the familiar Google suite of apps such as Maps, YouTube, and Chrome, but since it’s a Huawei phone, it’s also pre-installed with fistfuls of bloatware – such as the Booking.com app and the Honor Store – that you’d probably be better off without.
What’s even more disappointing is the lack of NFC, so you won’t be able to use remote pay apps such as Google Pay.

We’re not great fans of Huawei’s EMUI software, and the Android One phones in the same price bracket have a cleaner, more attractive interface. This is unlikely to be a dealbreaker for many consumers, though.
Should you buy the Honor 9X?
The Honor 9X offers strong all-round performance, with particular highlights the camera, the enduring battery life, and the strong performance.
We’re still awaiting the official UK price, but if it is in a similar bracket to its predecessor, then it’s a good bargain.
However, the elephant in the room is the lingering uncertainty over the relationship between parent company Huawei, and Google, which provides the Android software. In light of these ongoing issues, we cannot recommend Honor phones.

Verdict




























 



As much as the Galaxy Fold is a look at what the next wave of smartphones might be, at this stage it’s hard to recommend that anyone, aside from those who simply must have the first-gen of everything, actually spend nearly £2000 on it.

It’s impressive in a number of areas: great battery life, nice and productive software that actually makes some use of the bigger display and there are certain situations where having a tablet in smaller form-factor work. 



Pros

Genuinely innovative form-factor
Great battery life
Galaxy Buds in the box
Loads of cameras



Cons

It’s too delicate
Outer display feels too limited
It’s better as a tablet than a phone
Cameras aren’t class-leading






Key Specifications

Review Price: £1900
7.3-inch foldable display
4.6-inch FHD+ outer display
Snapdragon 855
12GB RAM
4380mAh battery
512GB storage
12MP + 12MP + 16MP cameras on the back
10MP + 8MP front cameras


The Samsung Galaxy Fold has had a tough year. Issues with the foldable screen marred the launch and it wasn’t until six months after its glitzy unveiling, alongside the Galaxy S10, that you could actually walk into a store, lay down nearly £2000 and own the first commercially available foldable phone.
Ever since I first held the Fold many months ago I have been eager to properly use it. To see if that tiny outer display was a waste; to see if the obvious crease down the middle would be off-putting and just generally to understand whether the hype around these devices is worthy.
After a week of feeling very self-conscious about unfolding a £2000 piece of kit on a rammed London Underground Tube and feeling both impressed and disappointed in equal measure, I can see why foldables will, eventually, be the future. 
The Samsung Galaxy Fold, however, is clearly a first-gen product that just makes me more excited about what is going to come next.
It might also be worth holding off on buying the Fold as we expect the Samsung Galaxy S20 launch to bring with it a new foldable.

Check out our hands-on Galaxy Note 20 review and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review

Screen and Design – An impressive achievement, even with the issues
The Galaxy Fold suffered numerous issues when it first launched. Early US-based reviewers struggled with debris getting caught under the panel and some even peeled off the outer layer of the foldable panel mistakenly thinking it was a screen protector. Not a great start.
Fast-forward six months and the Fold I am using is actually different to that original device. Not enough for Samsung to call it the Galaxy Fold 2, but enough to make it feel slightly different to use. The screen now runs right under the bezel (you couldn’t even attempt to peel it off) and there are thicker caps at the top and bottom to try and avoid stuff getting caught under the panel.
These fixes, for me anyway, seem to have worked and during my time with Fold it hasn’t broken. Which is, of course, good news.
Look past those initial issues and it’s hard not to get a feeling of excitement when you unbox the Fold. The phone consists of two screens: an outer 4.6-inch (1680 x 720) and an inner display that folds out into a 7.3-inch (2152 x 1536) almost square screen. That outer screen immediately looks odd, as there’s a (very) hefty bezel around it. Why this display doesn’t run edge-to-edge seems like an obvious design flaw and one that’ll hopefully be addressed in the followup.
The outer display is mainly used for notifications
Due to its small size, I mainly found myself using this 4.6-inch screen to answer calls, check incoming notifications and the time. Beyond that, it’s simply too small. Trying to type an email on the dinky keyboard is an unhappy task and while you’ve got full access to Android and all your apps, you won’t really want to game or watch Netflix on it. To be honest, I think Samsung knows this, but there really needs to be more to this outer display than just being a glorified notification panel. 
It’s when you unfurl the Fold that the fun really starts. This turns an oddly-shaped phone (someone in the office said it resembled a landline phone) into an almost mini-tablet that you can slip in your pocket. Thanks to some clever software continuity, if you have a WhatsApp message open on the outer display and unfold the Fold it’ll show up instantly on the bigger screen. For the apps that support it, this is great, and even for the ones don’t it only requires the app to restart, and that just takes a couple of extra seconds.

The squared-off nature of the inner screen doesn’t immediately suit video – you’ll have hefty black bars on the top and bottom – but I still absolutely love watching YouTube, Netflix and Prime Video on this thing. Flip it open on the train and you’ve got a tiny tablet that doesn’t require you to delve into your bag to reach. Quality-wise the screen is good: It’s OLED (both panels here use Samsung’s Super AMOLED tech) so you’ve got inky blacks and vivid colours, supports HDR10+ and gets very bright.
The screen isn’t perfect though, and I think the limitations are more obvious because of how good it could be. The biggest irritant is that the screen is covered in plastic, rather the usual glass. This is obviously required for the whole folding thing to work, but it makes for a panel that’s overly reflective, has an almost dimpled look and gets greasy and fingerprint covered very quickly. I feel like I am wiping this display down every time I want to use it. Plastic is also less durable than glass, so even a strong press with the tip of your thumb could cause damage. You’ll need to really treat this display with care.
Another issue is the crease. Which, again, feels like something that’s going to be a problem with foldables for the next few years. You can clearly see the line down the middle of the screen where it folds and it’s a distraction – especially when you’re looking at it from an angle or in bright sun. It’s there, it’s annoying and it’s hard to get over. There’s also a notch on the right-hand side which houses two front cameras – again, getting in the way.
Even with all these issues, the idea of the Fold is fantastic. Having a large view of Google Maps in your hand is fantastic and it works well as an (admittedly wildly expensive) e-book reader. I was sold on the future of foldable after a few days of using the Fold.
Away from the screen the Fold remains a mixture of great and annoying. There’s absolutely no water-resistance rating, for example, and I felt like it was constantly babying the phone whenever there was a slight drizzle. For a phone in 2019 that feels backwards. It’s also heavy (263g) and very thick. It basically feels like two phones stacked on top of each other and that makes it hard to stuff into your pocket.
There’s plenty of good stuff, too. The side-mounted fingerprint sensor is fast (though I do wish it acted as the home button too) and the hinge mechanism feels like a work of art. It clamps firmly into place when the phone is shut and there’s a satisfying thud when it opens and clicks into place.
Software – Tweaks for the unique form-factor are mostly a success
Foldables as a category is brand-new, so there’s not yet a definitive software experience we expect to see. The tweaked One UI software – built upon Android 9 – used here feels like a mixture of Android’s tablet and phone interface, with some apps showing more than you’d normally see on a typical phone screen.
Of course, having a bigger canvas to play with means there’s more space to have multiple apps open at once. With the Fold you can have three: a main one and two almost secondary apps. These can be resized and all interacted with at the same time. There’s also a handy ‘dock’ that slides out from the sides to show other apps you can jump to.
Open an app on the outside screen and when you flip the phone open, that app (if it’s properly supported) will instantly jump to the bigger screen. It works in reverse too, though this is switched off by default but can be altered on a per-app basis. 
All these additions are nice, however the biggest issues come from something completely out of Samsung’s hands: app compatibility. Open Instagram on the folded out display and everything feels off. Nothing scales properly, some elements are too small and a single post takes up the entire screen. The same goes for other apps I use a lot, like The Athletic and Monzo. Others fare better, with BBC Sport, video apps like Netflix and Google Maps all displaying well.
Oddly, I’ve probably had the most issues with a lot of Google’s apps and it feels like they’re often defaulting to the tablet view but then having to squash everything onto the Fold’s screen. Both YouTube and Gmail suffer from this, with the latter sometimes displaying fine and other times not.
Performance and 5G – Loads of RAM and storage
Unlike European versions of the S10 and Note 10 series, the Galaxy Fold only has one chipset option: the Snapdragon 855. There’s no Exynos version of the Fold and for us living outside of the USA that’s good news – I have always felt Samsung’s own chipsets struggle with battery life when compared to Qualcomm’s.
There’s 12GB RAM too – that’s plenty and more than enough for keeping many apps open and using apps side-by-side – and an impressive 512GB storage. There’s no expandable card slot but given the ample internal space you won’t need it anyway. This is a stacked phone spec-wise and that’s hardly a surprise for the price-tag.
You’ll also find the 5G model is only available in the UK (a regular 4G LTE version is being sold elsewhere and was originally slated for the UK) which, again, makes sense for a phone that’s being touted as a slice of the future.
The Fold is, of course, a fast phone. It scores impressively in Geekbench 5, outperforming the OnePlus 7T Pro in both single and multi-core tests. There’s not much of a jump from the 855-toting S10 series though, which is to be expected as there’s no new chip here. Games play without a hitch and, if they’re probably optimised for the display like Asphalt 9, are especially fun to play on the larger screen.

The speakers are good too: punchy and loud. However, the positioning on the sides does mean they can easily get blocked by your hands when the phone is unfolded.
While the phone lacks a headphone jack, Samsung has included a pair of its truly-wireless Galaxy Buds in the box. This is a nice touch and they’re a decent set of earphones if you’re not fussed about any ANC skills. These buds can also charge themselves upon the Fold thanks to the nifty Wireless Powershare feature.
Camera – Six sensors, but not top-of-the-class
There’s pretty much a camera everywhere you look on the Samsung Galaxy Fold. A 10-megapixel sensor sits on the front (or the Cover, as Samsung calls it), there are two inside (10MP f/2.2 26mm and 8MP f/1.9 24mm) and another three on the back. 
These rear cameras mirror those on the Galaxy S10 and, while they take generally very good pictures, they’re comfortably below the standards set by the Pixel 4, iPhone 11 and Huawei Mate 30 Pro. I’d even say the £399 Pixel 3a takes better general pictures, even if it does lack the versatility of the Fold’s array.
The three rear cameras include a 12-megapixel main sensor with an aperture that’ll shift between f/1.5 and f/2.4, another 12-megapixel sensor for 2x zooming and a 16-megapixel ultra wide angle camera. It’s a versatile array that takes reliably good pictures in various situations with nice, typically saturated colours. Detail is strong to the point of looking slightly over-sharpened in some instances though, but is the look Samsung goes for and I know a lot of people really like it – and it does lead to very good Instagram pictures.
Colours are really nice, even when the light isn’t great

Detail is generally good, though sometimes shots can feel artificially sharpened
Where the Samsung Galaxy Fold’s main camera struggles, especially when compared to the Pixel 4 and iPhone 11, is dynamic range. The lightest and darkest points are often muddy and not as obvious as I would like. It comes out better with its ultra wide camera though, which consistently turns out sharper snaps than the iPhone 11. Of course the Pixel 4 lacks the ultra wide camera altogether.
You can take pictures with the Fold both open and closed. However, I didn’t particularly enjoy either option. Shooting with it closed is my preferred method as it doesn’t feel like you’re taking photos with a tablet, but it can be hard to get a proper view of what you’re shooting.
Where the folding nature does help is with selfies. The two internal sensors combine to snap really good pictures of yourself and the screen is big enough to get a great idea of what the final result will look like.
Video capture is impressive, with stable footage recorded and a versatile selection of shooting options.
Battery life – Far from a worry
I was originally very skeptical about the battery life here, even though the 4380mAh cell sounds sizable enough. There are those two screens to power, one of which is larger than other phones on the market
Thankfully during the two week review period I have been consistently impressed with the phone’s endurance. An hour of Netflix streaming on the larger display only took the battery down 9% and I was usually ending the day with 20-30% left. That would then get me through a decent portion of the next day before I would need to plug it in. In terms of the rudimentary screen-on time method, it got over six hours use on a few occasions.
This strong battery life is likely in part to my slightly different usage of the Fold when compared to other flagships. With the outer display showing notifications – and using less juice – you’re not always unfolding the display.
Wireless charging remains, as does the Wireless Powershare feature that enables you to place other Qi-enabled devices on the Fold’s back and juice them up. This is very handy for charging AirPods, for example, or a Galaxy Watch Active.

There are two batteries inside the Fold
In the box there’s 15w fast charger which will take the Fold from 0-100% in roughly one hour and 50 minutes. I managed to get from 0-40% in 40 minutes. These aren’t the fastest speeds on the market and this is one area the Fold already feels somewhat outdated. I’d expect the Fold 2 to come with much faster charging.
Should you buy the Samsung Galaxy Fold?
As much as the Galaxy Fold is a look at what the next wave of smartphones might be, at this stage it’s hard to recommend that anyone, aside from those who simply must have the first-gen of everything, actually spend nearly £2000 on it.
It’s impressive in a number of areas: great battery life, nice and productive software that actually makes some use of the bigger display and there are certain situations where having a tablet in smaller form-factor work. 
But overall, it just feels like something that needs a lot of work. It’s far too delicate, has too many issues with the plastic inner display and doesn’t have a class-leading camera.
I have loved using the Galaxy Fold, and for Samsung to release something as genuinely new and exciting as this at a time when the majority of phones all feel very samey deserves plenty of appreciation. This is clearly a very innovative product that shows Samsung is going to be at the forefront of mobile innovation as we enter the next decade.
Verdict
More of a foldable tablet than a foldable phone, the Galaxy Fold excels in some areas and disappoints in others.

Verdict





























 



The Oppo A9 2020 is not the most impressive phone around on paper. It has a 720p screen and costs more than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, which has a 1080p display. Only two of its four rear cameras are useful too, but two solid cameras at £220 isn’t bad. However, the screen is surprisingly decent-looking and there’s a good chance you’ll fall in love with the Oppo A9 2020’s battery life – I did. 



Pros

Killer battery life
Large screen
Dual field of view camera



Cons

Low screen resolution
Glass-look back is plastic
Two of the four rear cameras don't do much

The Oppo A9 2020 stands out among the best phones around £200 when you actually live with it, more than it does on paper. To accept its strengths you need to come to terms with one key weakness.
It has a 720p screen, and I usually expect to see a 1080p display on the best cheap phones. However, the effect is less pronounced than I expected, and is offset by the size of the display. I’d rather watch a 15-minute YouTube video on the Oppo A9 2020 than a phone with a more advanced 5.5-inch screen.
Some of you may still be put off, and that’s fine when there are several very strong alternatives, but everyone can appreciate the Oppo A9 2020’s battery life, which is sensational. This alone makes it one of the lowest-maintenance phones I’ve used in the last five years.
I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this phone, even though there is a stack of little complaints to note. Read on to find out if one might really get on your nerves.
Oppo A9 2020 Design
The Oppo A9 2020 is a lower-end cousin of the Oppo Reno 2Z. Both have large screens and curved rears, but this phone has a plastic back instead of a glass one.
This is an unfortunate trend around this price. A couple of years ago you had several great glassy options hovering around £200. But nowadays more Huawei, Honor and Motorola phones use plastic, to lower production costs and create a greater separation between cheap and mid-range models.
I’ve used the Oppo A9 2020 for a few weeks now, and the Reno 2 I tried earlier this year has been sat on my sofa at home. Every now and then I’ve picked it up, and it’s a reminder the A9 really doesn’t feel like a high-end phone.

The rear plastic doesn’t have the cool and hard touch of glass, and the phone itself seems less dense as a result. However, when not accidentally comparing the Oppo A9 2020 to its twice-the-price sibling, it’s not a major issue.
This phone looks good, with a blue-purple light reactive finish and the kind of scale you’d associate with a top-end phone. Its back has picked up a few nicks already, so you may want to use a case. Oppo includes one, but it’s not great. It handles the protection part just fine, but makes the side buttons feels spongy.
To clean up some of the Oppo A9 2020 build basics: this phone is not water resistant, and while it is mostly plastic, the side buttons are metal and have a satisfying click. This may sound like a minuscule point, but does help make it feel less cheap than some bottom-rung plastic phones.
Oppo also fits a screen protector in the factory. There are no bubbles, and no sign of it lifting off at the sides, several weeks in.

Do bear the Oppo A9 2020’s size in mind. This is fairly large phone. A big screen demands a bigger footprint and it’s relatively thick, as Oppo prioritised battery life over minimising thickness.
I’ve had zero issues with the size but don’t buy this if you’ve used and disliked large phones. Oppo has added a “one-handed” feature in the software, which lets you load favourite apps from the side of the screen with a thumb. But I find it fiddly rather than particularly useful.

The Oppo A9 2020’s hardware extras are solid. It has a fast rear fingerprint scanner rather than an in-screen one like the Reno phones and stereo speakers. These are better than I expected, with good volume, decent stereo projection and tone that holds up just fine even at maximum volume.
I used the Pixel 4XL before this phone, and there’s usually a huge drop in sound quality when switching “leagues” like this. However, the Oppo A9 2020 holds up just fine, but predictably has less bass and mid-range richness than some pricier phones.
Oppo A9 2020 Screen
The screen is the thorniest part of the Oppo A9 2020. It is the part that appears to let the phone down, with a relatively low-resolution 1600 x 720 pixel panel in what is a very large 6.5-inch screen.
We’d all prefer a 1080p screen here, just like many would prefer a glass back. But I am flat-out surprised by how little the image seems compromised, particularly as someone who complained about larger-screen 720p phones regularly half a decade ago.
These panels seem to have reached the point at which you can’t really see the pixel structure, despite the relatively low pixel density. One of the most grating signs of a lower pixels-per-inch is seeing a very fine black grid, the gaps between the sub-pixel clusters.
There’s none of that in the Oppo A9 2020, and Google’s scaling of fonts and other objects in screens like this is radically better than it used to be. As a professionally techie, I feel I should dislike this screen. But I simply don’t.

The text scaling quality does vary a bit by app, though. In the ColorOS UI and Chrome it’s excellent. Twitter’s is not as strong, and makes the lower pixel density more obvious.
Its generous size is also great for video streaming, particularly when you consider the majority of Android phones only stream Netflix at 720p anyway (and some are limited to 540p).
YouTube is better at exposing its limits. The Oppo A9 2020 doesn’t support HDR, and naturally cannot play videos at resolutions beyond 720p. Motorola’s Moto G8 Plus can, for a little more money, as can the slightly cheaper Xiaomi Redmi Note 7. That’s a phone of such ridiculously good value it’s almost unfair to the competition.
I’d give the Oppo A9 2020’s colour reproduction a solid “B” grade. There’s the slight undersaturation common to budget LCD screens, and fresh out of the box the colour temperature was too cool. You can change the temperature in Settings, but not the saturation. My guess is the default mode already makes use of the panel’s capabilities.
The screen also has a swooping notch, with less severe lines than the Moto G8 Plus or Xiaomi Remi Note 7. There’s no option to block it off, potentially because the notifications bar actually dips a handful of pixels below the notch itself. Or, to go with the Occam’s Razor approach, cheaper phones tend to have fewer tweaks like this and customisable colour modes.

Oppo A9 2020 Software
Oppo’s A9 2020 runs Android 9 with ColorOS 6.1 interface on top. Its square icons were the first thing I noticed when I started using Oppo phones regularly again, with the Oppo Reno 2 and Reno 2Z.
I wasn’t a fan and initially found the look stiff. You may be able to change this in outside the EU too, as some other territories’ versions have a “themes store” app. In the UK you just get five preinstalled themes that barely change anything but the wallpaper and the look of a few core app icons.
However, a few weeks in I’m perfectly happy living with ColorOS. You can choose the number of rows and columns of icons in both the app drawer and homescrens, handy for a large-screen phone. And the app drawer itself is optional.

It also has a one-handed feature, mentioned earlier, but I don’t find this particular useful. The Oppo A9 2020 adds a homescreen too, Smart Assistant. This is a page of widget-like panels, home to info like the weather, a calendar view and a pane of app shortcuts. I’ve only found it useful as a way to quickly check my step count for the day, but then I have never found any of these home screen feeds particularly desirable. You can turn Smart Assistant off if you like.
I can’t recall bumping into any ColorOS related bugs in my time with the Oppo A9 2020. This phone doesn’t have the best software in the Android universe, but at this point I’d pick ColorOS over the LG G8X ThinQ’s UI.
Oppo A9 2020 Performance
The Oppo A9 2020 has a Snapdragon 665 processor. It has eight cores. Four are Kryo 260 Gold cores, comparable to Cortex-A73s. The other four are Kryo 260 Silvers, similar to Cortex-A53s.
This is the same CPU used in the Moto G8 Plus. The rival Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 has the older Snapdragon 660, but it’s not the wholesale upgrade the model numbers suggest.
The Snapdragon 660 has better fast charge standard support (QuickCharge 4.0 vs 3.0) and in some tests its Adreno 512 graphics chipset seems to outperform the Oppo A9 2020’s Adreno 610. There’s little to separate the two in terms of what will affect you day-to-day. And that’s a win for the cheaper Redmi Note 7.

Games run exactly as I’d expect for a phone in this class. The Oppo A9 2020 can play anything, and supports the Vulkan API required for a few high-end titles. However, you will need to cut back the graphics a little in some to see smooth results.
ARK: Survival Evolved is too choppy at “Epic” graphics with the resolution slider maxed-out. I’d be surprised if it wasn’t. If you want peak performance in games, look for one of the affordable phones with an 8-series Snapdragon CPU, like the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro or the older Pocofone F1, again from Xiaomi.
This tells you a lot about Xiaomi’s strategy. Its expansion into the West is fuelled by high-spec, low price phones. Oppo’s approach is more measured.
Oppo A9 2020 Camera
Did we say measured? That doesn’t quite apply to the cameras. The Oppo A9 2020 has four rear cameras. Two of them are useful, two seem to be almost entirely useless based on my testing. It’s hard enough to even track down what Oppo seems to think the other two do.
These extra cams have 2-megapixel sensors and have a hand in background blurred Portrait images and black and white photography.

My main issue is you can use the B&W mode and the Portrait mode with both the 2-megapixel cameras covered, with no obvious hit to image quality or the subject extraction in portraits. At best these extra cameras may speed up these modes slightly, but their main role is clearly to bulk up the spec list and make the Oppo A9 2020 seem more advanced than it actually is.
I have the same issues with the Portrait mode as those I saw in the Reno 2. Its cut-out algorithms are excellent, better than the iPhone 11’s or Pixel 4’s, but it’s so picky about the distance between the phone and your subject the blurring simply doesn’t kick in a lot of the time.
It’s a shame a mode this solid should see so little use.

The B&W mode is also fluff. It’s simply one of the filters in the app that most people ignore, choosing instead to add such processing when they upload to Instagram.
This is not a good quad camera array. But the number of cameras in a phone has become the new depressing way phones compete with each other, often without much substance to back them up.
Thankfully, there’s a lot to like about the Oppo A9 2020’s two primary cameras. One offers a standard view, and reportedly uses the 48-megapixel Samsung GM1 sensor. It’s likely cheaper than the more popular Sony IMX586, but still has solid credentials including 1/2-inch sensor size and the usual pixel binning to create “virtual” 1.6 micron sensor pixels.
The Oppo A9 2020’s second camera is an 8-megapixel ultra-wide.
Let’s start with the good parts. The choice of two fields of view is always welcome, and it makes street photography more fun. You can also zoom in to 2x and 5x views, but as there’s no actual zoom camera only the 2x is worth using. 5x images look horrible.
Detail of the main camera’s images is very good for a £200-ish phone, shutter lag is a consistent and not-too-annoying (roughly) 1/3 of a second. And there’s solid dynamic range enhancement in virtually all of your photos when you use the Auto HDR mode, enabled as standard.
If you find your shots look dull, you can also turn on Dazzle Color. This offers the kind of poppy-looking effect the first waves of “AI photography” offered, completely with seriously hyped colour, but sometimes great British afternoons need drastic measures.

I’m most impressed by the Oppo A9 2020’s night mode. This uses the same kinds of techniques as today’s high-end phones, taking several seconds and several exposures to improve night images.
It takes seven seconds, which now seems uncomfortably long, but radically improves detail and clarity in very low-lit scenes. What looks like mush in Auto mode is reasonably sharp in Night mode. It’s one of the biggest leaps in straight detail I’ve seen in such a mode recently.
However, the Oppo A9 2020’s night mode images aren’t as detailed or clean as the Pixel 3A’s or Huawei Mate 30 Pro, but both of those are in different classes price-wise.

Ready for the gripes? Part of the review process involves looking through all the photos I take with a phone and seeing which ones I should include or analyse. Far too many of the pics I was drawn to were taken with the wide camera. Part of this is about composition. Wide shots tend to look more unusual, and therefore more interesting.
However, the Oppo A9 2020’s wide camera also takes warmer-looking images and, bizarrely, the Auto HDR mode lifts the shadows more than it does in the main camera.
You can tweak these parts in the edit, and the primary camera’s photos stand up to scrutiny much better. Wide shots in tricky conditions can look a little milky in the shadows, for example. However, it seems unusual the Oppo A9 2020’s secondary camera takes images with more immediate charm.
The Oppo A9 2020 camera also refuses to take a photo if you are touching another part of the screen. It can get seriously annoying if you’re holding the phone at an awkward angle and your palm ends up touching part of it. The shutter button just refuses to fire.
It’s best to think of the Oppo A9 2020 as a dual rear camera phone, as the other two do not appear to add much at all. However, I’m still very happy with the performance here. This is a surprisingly flexible camera. Here are some photos taken with the phone:
      
  
Video is perhaps less impressive. You can shoot at up to 4K, 30 frames per seconds, but electronic stabilisation is only available at up to 1080p. This makes motion look much less shaky, and is a must if you take video doing anything but standing still.
The Oppo A9 2020’s front camera has a 16-megapixel sensor, a fairly good one too. It can capture a lot of fine detail in indoors lighting. And if there’s a bit too much detail for your tastes you can use Oppo’s “AI beautification”. This offers eight sliders that give you virtual plastic surgery. They might as well be called botox, rhinoplasty, chin chiselling, lipsuction and so on. But in bad lighting, we can all do with a bit of face smoothing.
Oppo A9 2020 Battery Life
The Oppo A9 2020 has terrific battery life. It’s easily my favourite part of the phone. And there’s a real difference between big battery 4000mAh phones and this one, which has a 5000mAh battery.
All those moments of battery anxiety that make you consider the battery level before you leave the house are gone. On many days I’m left with more than 50% by midnight. I’ve gone to bed with over 60% on a few occasions.

Not once have I had to give the phone a quick top-up, even on days when I’ve given in to distraction and ended up watching some YouTube on my phone when I should really have been working.
This is one of the longest-lasting phones I’ve used in years, and it easily eclipses all the £800-1000 models I’ve tried recently. Top-end phones have to prioritise design in a way Oppo hasn’t here. The difference is only a millimetre or so of thickness, but the Oppo A9 2020 shows what you can get when you give that up.
The phone is not particularly fast to charge, though. It takes three hours using the standard charger.

Should you buy the Oppo A9 2020?
The Oppo A9 2020 is not the most impressive phone around on paper. It has a 720p screen and costs more than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, which has a 1080p display.
Only two of its four rear cameras are useful too, but two solid cameras at £220 isn’t bad.
There’s a good chance you’ll fall in love with the Oppo A9 2020’s battery life, though. I did. In a few days I’m going to have to switch to a phone that won’t last nearly as long.
Reviewing phones, you rarely end up missing them after they’re gone. But I’ll miss the Oppo A9 2020, primarily for its ultra-marathon style battery life, but also its solid speakers and large, surprisingly decent-looking screen.

UPDATE: This review has been amended to confirm that the Huawei Watch GT 2 does have the option of enabling an always-on display
What is the Huawei Watch GT 2?
The Huawei Watch GT 2 is the smartwatch sequel to the Huawei Watch GT. It’s main focus is fitness tracking, rather than being the kind of multi-functional device that lets you deal with messages and notifications without using your phone. Its operating system is Huawei’s own-brand Lite OS. The version we reviewed has a 46mm casing, but a 42mm variant is also available.

Huawei Watch GT 2 design and screen – Suited to wear both in and out of the gym
The Huawei Watch GT 2 has a circular face and two crowns like a traditional watch, in contrast to the round-edged square look of the Apple Watch Series 5 or the Xiaomi Mi Watch. It has a sturdy yet smart construction that complements more formal wear, as well as being suitable for tracking your exercise in the gym. This makes it more fashionable than many dedicated fitness trackers at the same price point.
There are 14 different watch face designs to choose from to personalise your device, ranging from the minimalist to those packed with complications.
The AMOLED screen measures 1.4in, with a pixel density of 462ppi. It’s a nice sharp screen, displaying strong colours  and decent level of brightness. In order to save battery life, it’s not set to “always-on” by default. Fortunately, you can change this by simply navigating through the settings as follows: Settings > Display > Advanced > Standby Watchface. It’s up to you whether the battery advantages offset the inconvenience of a watch that’s not always readable.

Huawei Watch GT 2 battery, performance and features – Decent battery life and problem-free touchscreen interaction
The flip-side to having a screen that reverts to standby is the incredible battery life. Huawei claims the Watch GT 2 will last up to two weeks on a single charge, an astonishing boast that was borne out by our testing.
It’s incredibly useful to know that it will bear up for such a long time before needing a charge, and it’s a bit of a weight off your mind to know that it will easily last through the day.
Performance proved snappy, and using the physical interface is problem-free. The watch has two crowns on the side of the face, one of which brings up the main menu and the other the exercise menu by default; the latter can be remapped as a shortcut to a different function.

The rest of the activity is accessed via touchscreen interaction. Purists might fear that sweaty fingers might result in operational issues after an intensive workout, but I experienced no problems.
The interface is easy to navigate, but if you’re looking for the full smartwatch experience then it’s likely to come up short. You can receive phone call notifications on your phone, which is useful, and you’ll get a couple of fitness-related notifications through the day (for hitting your step count, or if you need to “get up and move”). However, you can’t respond to messages via the watch. You can use the 4GB capacity for storing music to get you through your workout, though.
The software, based on Huawei’s own Lite OS, doesn’t have an app store – and you can’t download any new apps to the watch; you’re stuck with the pre-installed apps. Fortunately, this covers most bases, such as exercise tracking that covers the full triathlon, as well as practical helping hands such as a stopwatch and flashlight.
Nevertheless, it offers nothing like the versatility of the Apple Watch or even some Wear OS devices.
Huawei Watch GT 2 fitness tracking – Runners can make use of their own personal pacemaker
The Huawei Watch GT 2 can track several different exercises, including the triathlon disciplines of running, swimming and cycling. While wearing the watch for running, I found that the GPS was super-accurate in its distance and pace calculations, which are displayed clearly during the activity.

In a feature bound to be divisive, it has a speaker that announces your performance stats aloud during your workout – so every kilometre, a disembodied voice will inform surrounding bystanders of your time and heart rate. Some people will find this more useful than peering down at the watch face, but it made me self-conscious
Another feature I didn’t much care for was the addition of a “virtual runner”, whose performance acts as a pacemaker for you while you’re running – but others may find it to be a useful motivating influence.
On the positive side, the watch did me a favour by alerting me through haptic feedback and an on-screen notification that I was regularly and significantly exceeding my maximum heart rate. I correspondingly moderated my exercise habits to reduce the strain on my heart and improve the speed of my recovery after exercise.
Huawei Watch GT 2: Huawei Health App Interface
The watch also offers 24/7 heart rate tracking (even whilst swimming, which is a rarity), and the results corresponded with other high-performing smartwatches. It doesn’t offer the electrocardiogram facility that is now even offered by the Withings Move ECG in the same price bracket.
Sleep tracking – still shockingly not natively supported by the Apple Watch Series 5 – is present on the Huawei Watch GT 2, and I generally found this feature to be accurate. It can even reliably identify the non-continuous patterns of sleep that can elude other wearables; but on one occasion it incorrectly defined a particularly relaxing “al desko” lunch break as a nap.
Unlike some watches that are completely reliant on their complementary app, you can browse through many of your fitness indicators on the watch itself without needing to get out your phone, which is handy. The phone app itself, Huawei Health, has a very clear and informative interface that should satisfy amateur athletes as well as nervous newbies.
Should you buy the Huawei Watch GT 2?
If you’re looking for a smartly designed watch with robust fitness features, then this is a good option for a good price. But if you want the added convenience of a true smartwatch that will allow you to deal with admin on the go, then there are several watches better-suited to your requirements.
Verdict
This isn’t an all-singing, all-dancing smartwatch that can act as a supplementary smartphone, but it works well as a fitness tracker and has a premium design that belies its competitive price.

Verdict




























 



It’s a solid phone at an appealing price, but unlike its siblings, with the Motorola One Macro you can really see where compromises have been made.



Pros

Super-clean Android experience at a bargain price
Brilliant battery life
Surprisingly decent performance



Cons

Inadequate 720p display
Macro camera a bit of a gimmick
Main camera disappoints

Motorola’s growing family of One phones offer a pure Android experience combined with a single stand-out camera feature, all at an affordable price.
Following on from the Motorola One Vision, the Motorola One Action and the Motorola One Zoom, the Motorola One Macro is notable for two things. As per its name, the Macro packs a unique secondary camera that lets you take extreme close-up shots.
Perhaps more significantly, the Motorola One Macro is the cheapest phone in the range by some margin. Priced at just £179, it’s one of the most affordable handsets in the current Motorola lineup.
Naturally, there have been a few compromises in order to reach that price point, some of which are more consequential than others.
Motorola One Macro design – Wider and cheaper
There’s definitely a shared design language at play with the Motorola One range, but the accents differ slightly.
The Motorola One Macro’s shiny back and curved edges follow on from its siblings, as do the basic shape and alignment of its camera module and fingerprint sensor. But the front of the phone adopts a dewdrop notch, rather than the hole-punch design of the Vision and Action devices.
It’s a much wider and stockier device, because Motorola has reverted to a slightly more orthodox 19:9 display aspect ratio. That makes it trickier to wield in one hand; but by the same token it doesn’t have the same jarringly lanky proportions.
While the fingerprint sensor is well placed, not to mention speedy and reliable, the volume buttons are positioned too high on the right-hand edge. I could just about reach the textured power button with my thumb, but found that I had to shuffle the phone in my hand if I wanted to adjust the sound.
The Motorola One Macro’s shiny back and curved edges follow on from its siblings
There’s a certain heft to this phone, but 186g isn’t exactly heavy by modern standards. It does look a little cheaper than the Motorola One Action though, perhaps because of the shiny two-tone finish to its plastic rear. I’m not saying the effect is unpleasant exactly, but it definitely looks a little chintzier than its more sober and professional siblings.
Even if you’re enamoured by that flashy finish, it won’t stay pristine for long. This handset wears fingerprints like an autumn coat.
There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top, and despite the cheaper price tag you still get a USB-C port on the bottom; it sits alongside a mono speaker.
Motorola One Macro display – Don’t get too close
The Motorola One Macro’s 6.2in IPS LCD panel is big and, as we’ve just discussed, more uniformly proportioned than its siblings. 19:9 makes for a much more “normal” all-around viewing experience than the super-stretched 21:9 screens of the Action and Vision.
Sadly, it lacks sharpness. One of the ways in which Motorola appears to have achieved the Macro’s lower price point is by cutting the pixel count, which means a 1520 x 720 resolution. This is also known as HD+, or a slightly longer form of the classic 720p standard.
This was one of the negatives of the original Motorola One, which launched in 2018. And while the Motorola One Macro is a cheaper phone, coming in well under £200, I still don’t think this is a compromise that should have been made.
It isn’t that the Motorola One Macro’s display is bad. It’s clear and balanced and plenty bright enough – in most conditions, at least. But hold it next to a similarly proportioned 1080p phone such as the Motorola One Action, as I did, and the difference is clear to see.
We would like a slightly higher-res screen
The One Action display is brighter and cooler, giving the One Macro a slightly sickly tint by comparison. It’s that small details simply look crisper and, well, more as they should be on the sharper device.
For example, image thumbnails in Google Photos look properly representative on a 1080p display like that of the One Action. They look horribly pixellated on the One Macro, like they’re being stored in the cloud and have yet to properly load.
Without comparing the two, the Motorola One Vision display is perfectly fine and functional. You might not even notice the slight fuzzy nature that it lends certain UI elements.
But 1080p feels like table stakes for a phone edging north of £150 in 2019. And on that front, the Motorola One Macro comes up short.
There’s also a certain irony to having such a display in a phone that seems to encourage you to get closer and revel in the fine detail.
Motorola One Macro performance – Surprisingly speedy
Call me an ill-informed tech snob, but when I saw that the Motorola One Macro was powered by a MediaTek processor, I assumed that the phone would suffer in the performance stakes.
MediaTek generally produces cheaper chips for low-end phones, which helps manufacturers hit those challenging entry-level price points. But the results are often correspondingly modest.
Given that both the Motorola One Vision and the Motorola One Action packed the Samsung Exynos 9609, this seemed likely to be the case again.
However, I’m pleased to say that the MediaTek MT6771 Helio P70 in the One Macro comes up with the goods. I wouldn’t describe it as an out-and-out power house, but it produces a level of performance that makes pretty much any task feel comfortable. And that’s all you can really ask for at this price.
Ably assisted by 4GB of RAM, the Motorola One Macro felt fluid and stutter-free throughout my time with it. My Geekbench 4 benchmark tests confirmed this; indeed, an average multi-core score of 5732 easily trumped the Motorola One Vision’s 5123.
The Helio P70 packs the same Mali-G72 graphics chipset as the Samsung Exynos 9609, so you’ll get similar gaming performance. Most advanced games will default to Medium settings, but I was able to push Call of Duty Mobile’s and PUBG Mobile’s graphics settings to High and still get perfectly playable (if perfectly smooth) results.

That 720p display will doubtless have helped in this regard, of course. Together with a solid CPU and ample RAM, having fewer pixels to push around makes the Motorola One Macro a surprisingly competent gaming device.
You get 64GB of storage to play with, which no longer seems as generous as it once would have given that there are now affordable phones with 128GB out there. But you can expand this using the included microSD slot.
Motorola One Macro software – One for all and all for One
You’re getting Android 9.0 Pie with the Motorola One Macro, but not just any old sloppily reskinned version. This is Android One, which means tampering has been kept to a minimum.
In particular, the general navigation experience is as pure an Android affair as you’re going to get this side of a Pixel phone. Everything from the app icons to the menus to the implementation of the Google feed (just swipe right) is as Google intended it.
Perhaps best of all, the stock selection of apps is all Google. You get Gmail for emails, Google Calendar for organisation, and even Google Keep for taking notes – which is an app that’s very often left off by third-party manufacturers, for some inexplicable reason.
This all combines to make for a very clean, cohesive experience, with none of the confusing bloat of phones that apply heavy custom skins and unwanted apps.
You get given a couple of basic navigation options early doors. By default there’s the old-fashioned three-button method, with virtual keys for back, home, and app switching along the bottom of the homescreen. But you’ll soon be prompted to try the more modern, gesture-based approach.
This gives you a single elongated home button. Swipe left from this to go back and swipe right to switch to the previous app. Swiping up, meanwhile, brings up the full app switching menu.
I still don’t find Android’s gesture system as fluid or intuitive as that of iOS, but it’s a tidy enough way to get around the OS once you’re attuned to its quirks.
While it’s slight, Motorola has made its own imprint on the One Macro’s UI. The camera app is all its own for one thing, but Moto Actions also proves useful. These are a range of potentially useful customisable gestures, such as a double-twist to send you into the camera and a double-chop to activate the flashlight.
Motorola One Macro camera – The devil is in the detail
One of the big differentiating factors between all the Motorola One phones is their individual camera offerings. The Vision has a pixel-packed main camera, for example, while the Action offers enhanced video capabilities and the Zoom features a telephoto lens.
It’s quite a distinctive camera array
In the One Macro you get a dedicated Macro camera. This means you can get up to five times closer to your subject than might be possible ordinarily.
In practice, I was able to get within an inch or so of flowers and insects – the Motorola One Macro’s camera was still able to lock on and take detailed shots.
Or at least that’s how it appeared on the One Macro’s slightly fuzzy screen. When I opened up the captured macro shots on a large, sharp MacBook Pro display, the results were a little disappointing.
Yes, they’re generally in focus, and I was able to get a uniquely clear perspective on things like a ladybird feasting on an aphid. But, sadly, the detail from this camera proved to be lacking, with a noisy, grainy look that perhaps speaks to its humble 2-megapixel specification.
There’s also the simple fact that macro photography is something of a niche proposition. Certainly in comparison to the singular strengths of the Motorola One Vision, One Action, and the new One Zoom, being able to get super-close to your subject isn’t going to improve your everyday shots.
Performance isn’t amazing away from the macro camera, either. General snaps are taken care of by a bog-standard combination of a 13-megapixel f/2.0 main camera and a 2-megapixel f/2.2 depth-sensing assistant. You also get a Laser AutoFocus time of flight (ToF) sensor.
The general shooting experience is a mixed bag. The Motorola Camera app is intuitive enough, but it’s a little wallowy and occasionally slow to focus, resulting in the odd blurry shot. I also noticed a sizeable delay when taking portrait shots, although the results are pretty good for such a cheap phone, with a sharply defined subject and not too much in the way of weird edge artefacts.
I found the quality of normal shots to be lacking, however, with a generally flat and washed-out appearance. The One Macro also has a tendency to overexpose clouds and other bright areas, despite the auto HDR mode kicking in quite reliably.
Dark shots are more or less a no-no, with no dedicated Night mode and a relatively dim f/2.0 main lens. The results are grainy alright.
Not the worse result, but the Macro tends to flatten shots
HDR isn’t always effective at reigning in bright spots
I was able to get very close to this tiny flower, but check out the noisy background
The macro camera lets you shoot creatively, but there’s lots of noise
Macro shots give you close-up clarity, but with a lot of noise…
…while the same close-up with the main camera fails to focus as well, but packs in more pixels

There’s no Night mode, and the results with Auto aren’t pretty
The camera occasionally fails to focus properly in decent time
Motorola One Macro battery life – Fantastic stamina
The Motorola One Macro has a much bigger battery than the One Action and One Vision; it’s the same as the Motorola One Zoom. Its 4000mAh unit, like the Zoom, leads to some truly impressive stamina.
Indeed, with a less pixel-packed display, this might be the longest-lasting Motorola One phone of the lot.
I was able to get a full two days of moderate use out of the Macro in between charges, during which time I indulged in a bout of intensive photo-taking and a fair amount of web browsing.
Elsewhere, 15 minutes of Netflix streaming with the brightness at full sapped just 3% of the charge. To give you a point of reference here, something like the Nokia 7.2 (which has average stamina) lost 5% under the same circumstances.
You don’t get the 15W Turbo Charger of the Motorola One Zoom here, however. This being a cheaper phone, you only get a 10W unit in the box – although it’s still no slouch.

Should I buy the Motorola One Macro?
Motorola’s line of One phones offers clean design, elegant software, and competent performance across the board. The Motorola One Macro offers all of these things at the lowest price of them all.
It’s a solid pick for anyone with less than £200 to spend for these very reasons. In particular, the phone’s performance, clean Android One UI, and exemplary battery life prove considerable draws.
Getting right up close to the One Macro doesn’t flatter it, however. The core selling point of a dedicated macro camera turns out to be somewhat underwhelming, even gimmicky, with noisy results and limited practical benefit. The phone’s 720p display, meanwhile, is a notable downgrade from the rest of the range.

Verdict




























 



If you have a Moto G7 Plus, or recent Motorola One-series smartphone, there's little reason to upgrade to the Moto G8 Plus. But for those with older handsets, the G8 Plus remains a solid mid-range Android device that gets nearly all the basics right. Notable shortcomings include a camera that could do with more work and a RAM count that's low by today's standards.



Pros

Good value for money
Ticks all the right boxes for most people
Best speakers you'll find on a mid-range phone



Cons

Not a huge update on the G7 Plus
Camera has a few annoying limitations






Key Specifications

Review Price: £239


The Moto G8 Plus is the latest flagship affordable smartphone from Motorola. Like past Moto G phones it aims to offer buyers premium specs and features traditionally seen on significantly more expensive Android phones.
However, this time round its place in the market is a little trickier to gauge and there are lots of best mid-range and best cheap phones around. Motorola’s muddied the waters by releasing a steady stream of One-series phones, like the Motorola One Action and Motorola One Zoom, which target the same segment of the market as the G8 Plus. The Moto G7 Plus came out less than a year ago and remains an impressive device in its own right.
Xiaomi, Honor and Samsung have all also been releasing a steady stream of great phones targeting the same price point. You may justifiably be wondering what extra features the Moto G8 Plus brings to the table to differentiate itself.
After a week with the phone, sadly, my answer is not a lot. But by getting all the basics right – and offering a near untouched Android install – it remains a solid and generally reliable affordable phone nonetheless.

Design and Screen

Premium feeling chassis
Circular fingerprint scanner on the back
6.3-inch display is pretty good

The Moto G8 Plus follows the same design philosophy as the Moto G7 Plus. It features a mixed plastic and glass chassis, with an alluring semi-translucent colouring that makes it look a little like a tweaked Huawei P30. Round front it even has the same teardrop notch, which houses a 25-megapixel front snapper.
Outside of its colouring the only other major design difference between it and the Moto G7 Plus is that it has a rectangular camera housing on its left. The G7 Plus has a central, circular housing.
The chassis feels fairly premium and was robust enough to survive an accidental direct encounter with a pavement unscathed. It doesn’t come with a firm IP water resistance rating so you’ll want to avoid it having any aquatic adventure.
The design also ticks all the right boxes when it comes to functionality. Round back you’ll find a circular fingerprint scanner that worked great 99% of the time. The only time I had any issues with it was when trying to use the scanner in drizzle.
The USB C port and inclusion of a 3.5mm headphone input are both welcome features you’re not guaranteed to find on competing, similarly priced phones. The microSD card slot makes it quick and easy to upgrade the 64GB of onboard storage.
The phone’s slightly chunky 9.1mm thickness is the only design factor hinting at its mid-range price.

Powering up the phone you’ll be treated to one of the G8 Plus’ best features – it’s 6.3-inch screen.
The IPS panel doesn’t offer the deep blacks you’ll find on more expensive phones’ OLED screens, but it’s still a cut above most competing affordable and mid-range handsets when it comes to display quality.
The 0.1 black level and 197nits max brightness aren’t HDR but they give the screen a solid 1612:1 contrast ratio. In English, this means the screen is suitably bright and immersive for Netflix binging and gaming. The immersiveness is helped by the Moto G8 Plus stereo speakers, which are best in class for this price. Audio is suitably punchy and loud enough for streaming in bed.
Colour gamut coverage is also solid across the common sRGB (98%), DCI-P3 (85%) and Adobe RGB (72%). The only slight disappointment is that it has a slightly cool 7465K colour temperature that’s a fair way from the 6500k ideal. This means colours, can look a little muted, though this is an issue on most phones this price. All-in-all the screen is great for the money.

Camera

Triple sensor array on the back
48MP main, 16MP ultra wide and 5MP depth
Things aren’t so great when the light is low

Camera quality is a key area Motorola’s been using to differentiate its mid-range phones. This is most evident on its latest Motorola One Zoom and Motorola One Action smartphones. Both attempt to differentiate themselves by offering triple-sensor rear camera setups that, on paper, are similar to significantly more expensive phones.
The Moto G8 Plus follows the two phones lead and comes loaded with a triple sensor rear camera that combines 48-megapixel, f/1.7 main, 16-megapixel ultra-wide and 5-megapixel depth parts.
In regular light, the setup works great. The laser autofocus is super quick and means, generally you’ll never miss your shot. The 48-megapixel main sensor also captures suitably sharp and detailed photos for use on social media. Images generally also look suitably vibrant and feature decent contrast and colour accuracy.
The third depth camera also does a reasonable job creating a bokeh effect when using the camera’s portrait mode. This where the foreground/subject of the photo is in focus, while the background is slightly blurred.
Low light, as ever, things get a little pixellated, even when using the phone’s dedicated night mode, but this is standard for a phone this price.
I’m a little more perturbed about how the secondary wide angle has been setup. The wide-angle doesn’t actually take wide-angle shots. Instead, it’s used to shoot GoPro style videos. Specifically it lets you capture horizontal videos while holding the phone vertically, which could be useful in certain situations, but is nowhere near as handy as a full fat wide angle.

Battery Life

4000mAh battery is capable
We managed up to 2 days of use
15w charging feels a little bit slow

The Moto G8 Plus is powered by sizable 4000mAh battery. With regular use I found the phone easily lasts around a 1.5-2 days use. This entailed using the Moto G8 Plus as my primary smartphone.
On an average day this would see me listen to music on my morning and evening commute, regularly check incoming messages and my social media feeds, sporadically browse the web and take and make a few calls on the Moto G8 Plus. This is excellent by today’s standards. Most phones still struggle to make it past the day and a half mark with average use.
The phone also dealt with demanding processes, such as video streaming and gaming, pretty well. Looping video on Netflix with the screen locked to 150 nits the Moto G8 Plus dropped an average of 6-8% of its charge per hour. Playing demanding 3D games, such as PUBG, the average discharge rate was around 14-16% per hour. These are solid figures by today’s smartphone standards.
The only downside is that the Moto G8 Plus is a little sluggish when it comes to charge speeds. The phone technically has 15W Fast Charging, but in general I found it takes over an hour and a half to get the phone from 0% to 100%.
Performance

Inside you’ll find a Snapdragon 665
This is paired with 4GB RAM

The Moto G8 Plus’ performance is a similar story. The mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 CPU and 4GB of RAM aren’t flagship level specifications, but they’re more than powerful enough to run most Android apps. I was able to play demanding 3D games without noticeable lag and do minor photo touch up work in Pixlr without any serious performance blips.
I only had issues when multitasking with multiple demanding processes running. Here the low RAM count became an issue and there were minor slow downs and performance glitches.

You should buy it if…
You want good value for money
Moto G devices have long been some of the best value choices in the Android space and that’s still the case here.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You have a Moto G7
Motorola didn’t upgrade too much for the G8 Plus so if you have the previous gen model there’s little here to get you excited about an upgrade.
Verdict
If you have a Moto G7 Plus, or recent Motorola One-series smartphone then there’s little reason to upgrade to the Moto G8 Plus. But, if you are on an older phone, then it remains a solid mid-range Android phone that gets nearly all the basics right. The only serious shortcoming is that its camera could do with a little work and its RAM count is a little low by today’s standards.

Verdict




























 



If the dual screen accessory was something that drew you to the LG V50, then you should certainly consider this model instead. It fixes many of the issues of the first-gen unit and makes a much stronger case for the product to exist.



Pros

Good main camera
Decent battery life
Has a headphone jack, a good one



Cons

Dual screen accessory is clunky
LG UX interface isn't the prettiest
No zoom camera

LG has not tried to compete directly with the top phones from Samsung and Apple with its latest wave of phones. The result is the LG G8X ThinQ.
This is a top-end mobile with some of the same hardware as the £800-1000 models. But the price is low enough to offset LG’s relative lack of raw brand cred these days.
At this point LG has even intersected with the former darling of affordable phones. The LG ThinQ G8X costs $699 with the “second screen” case accessory, similar to the cost of the OnePlus 7 Pro.
But is the LG G8X ThinQ as good? No. The design is a little more conservative. The fingerprint scanner is not as reliable. The camera array is not as versatile and the speakers could be more powerful. However, it is a solid all-arounder well worth considering if your network offers a good deal for the handset.

LG G8X ThinQ Design – Metal and Glass
The LG G8X ThinQ has a design to match its price – it’s not remotely cheap, but is more affordable than the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus or iPhone 11 Pro. It is metal and glass, and has a large screen but not the tiniest screen surrounds around. Its notch style, a little dimple at top of the display, could these days belong to a £200 phone.
This is a good-looking, somewhat minimalist phone. But if you want one people will instantly recognise as ultra-pricey, the LG G8X probably isn’t it, not least because the phone is unlikely to be hugely popular, or an enthusiast’s choice like a OnePlus.
A few parts of the hardware do stand out. No part sticks out of the LG G8X ThinQ back. The rear Gorilla Glass 6 panel is used to cover both the cameras and the dual-LED flash. That silver border around the lenses? It sits behind the glass.

This puts a lot of faith in the scratch resistance of Gorilla Glass 6. Most phones still have raised metal borders around the camera housing to take the brunt of any scrapes. And Oppo’s recent Oppo Reno 2 has a little metal dot that lifts the back off the camera glass ever-so-slightly.
Some may say the LG G8X ThinQ style is a gamble, but it does look good. The back isn’t a completely flat panel of glass either. It curves at all four sides for a smooth look and feel.
LG also earns bonus points for its use of a headphone jack. Hardly any new £500-plus phones have one these days. LG has an extra reason to add one too. An advanced DAC has been a left-field draw of higher-end LG phones for several years, and the LG G8X ThinQ is no different. It has the same 32-bit DAC as the LG G7 ThinQ.

What does it do? This translates the digital audio data your phone’s apps produce into an analogue signal your headphones can relay. It does nothing for wireless headphones, as they receive audio digitally and there’s a DAC in the headphones themselves.
This is a good fit for higher-end wired headphones, as the amplifier inside is good too. The headphone jack alone is a solid draw for many at this point, though.
With such a focus on audio, I’m a little disappointed by the LG G8X ThinQ’s own speakers. There’s one on the front, another on the bottom, but the sound is not that loud or powerful. I switched to the G8X from the Google Pixel 4XL, and its speakers are significantly better. However, the sound gets a boost if you sit the phone on its back against a solid surface, as it resonates a bit.
The fingerprint scanner does not impress either. This is an in-screen scanner, placed in the usual thumb-friendly position towards the bottom of the screen. However, it is not particularly fast and seems to require far more second (or third) attempts than other phones I’ve used recently with similar scanners. I’ve tried re-teaching the LG G8X ThinQ my fingerprint, but it continues to fail to recognise my thumb regularly.

The other notable hardware extra was seen in the LG G7 too: a Google Assistant button on the left hand-side. And like last time, you can’t re-map it do anything else at launch. Still, it’s handy to have if you like Google Assistant, and does not get in the way if you don’t.
The LG G8X ThinQ is also water resistant to IP68, ready for complete submersion. My advice, as ever, is not to do this deliberately.
LG G8X ThinQ Screen – Is this a real foldable?
There’s a good chance you’re here because you have seen the LG G8X ThinQ described as a dual-screen phone. This makes it seem like a cheaper alternative to something like the Samsung Galaxy Fold.
The reality is a little different. You can get the LG G8X ThinQ with the LG dual screen case. This plugs into the phone itself using a USB-C connector, and has two screens of its own. There’s a small, low-res 2.1-inch OLED panel on the front, which shows you the time, battery life and recent notification icons.
This is similar to the display you might see on a windowed “folio” style case.

The display inside is more interesting, a 6.4-inch OLED screen that matches the main screen millimetre-for-millimetre. You use this as a second screen. It lets you run two apps at once, and you can load apps on either display. Fire up Chrome and you can also make a webpage scroll between the two.
Both are touchscreens, both have access to the app drawer and the second screen even gets its own homescreen, to which you can add a widget or two.
LG has made the software that gets this working, and it has done its best. You can, for example, make the LG G8X ThinQ’s second screen launch an app automatically when dual screen is used.

Gaming is the best use for the dual screen. You can turn one of the displays into a virtual controller, and there are four baked-in presets. They cover Xbox-style pads, retro controllers and a car steering wheel. How well they work depends on whether a game has been optimised for a gamepad.
Ark: Survival Evolved works well, PUBG less so. However you can also design your own layouts, and these are then linked the games you made them for. You lay down the buttons, then drag the corresponding touch zones they control on the other screen. This worked very well for Sonic 1, which barely needs any buttons and works best with a minimal layout. It had me playing all the way through the Green Hill zone.
Yep, that horrible D-pad placement is (mostly) deliberate
The LG Gamepad feature lets you add little haptic feedback buzzes when you press a button too. Is it a replacement for a real physical controller? No, and buttons won’t respond if your other thumb is resting on a non-mapped zone. That caused a few lost lives in Sonic. However, it’s more practical than carrying around a Bluetooth controller, and frees up the screen so your thumbs don’t obscure the visuals.
There’s still a sense that the dual screen is a work-in-progress. I’ve encountered some strange bugs. Sometimes the soft keys go AWOL when you remove the case, although LG is likely to fix such problems fairly swiftly with software updates.
Size is the real issue here. The LG G8X ThinQ is huge with the dual screen case attached. It adds more than a centimetre of width to the phone.

Still, the dual screen case feels more likely to hold up to real life better than a Samsung Galaxy Fold. Its front and inside panels are glass, and the outer is covered with rubberised plastic. The hinge feels solid too, although the way the tension varies a lot through its articulation makes it seem an experimental accessory. Apple wouldn’t release something like this for the iPhone.
Adding a pointless notch will seem odd to many too. There’s no camera in it, although it’s likely there so when apps are flung over from the main screen, the screen shape and style are identical.

The second screen’s quality is very good for an add-on like this. It’s a 6.4-inch 2340 x 1080 pixel OLED, but in my LG G8X at least there’s a slight but noticeable difference in colour tone between the two panels.
I have mostly used the G8X without the second screen as it’s more practical flying solo. The main screen is also a 6.4-inch OLED panel of 2340 x 1080 pixel resolution, similar to the OnePlus 7T’s.
Top brightness is excellent and the effect of the just OK pixel density is only evident when you look at the LG G8X ThinQ close-up. The phone also has an always-on screen mode, handy for checking out the time when the phone is sat next to your laptop (yes, your laptop can tell you the time too).

I’m not a huge fan of what LG has done with its screen calibration, though. The LG G8X ThinQ has a whopping seven display modes, mimicking Samsung’s old style (it has since slimmed down your options). However, where Samsung used these modes to make the screen line-up with industry standards, LG’s mostly seem to alter colour temperature. All preset modes bar “Web” are fairly saturated.
To get a relaxed sRGB appearance to you have to use the Expert mode, dig into the Advanced settings and pull down the saturation slider. You also need to play with the LG G8X ThinQ to get clean-looking whites.
Other manufactures handle OLED screens better. But this is still a high-quality OLED screen so we’re quibbling about the top 10% of performance here, and you have the controls to get the screen looking as you like. After fiddling my G8X ThinQ looks great to my eyes.
The OLED panel itself is not the most advanced around, though, as it has a standard refresh rate of 60Hz, not the 90Hz on offer in phones like the OnePlus 7T and Google Pixel 4XL. 90Hz is a “nice to have” extra, and it makes Android’s menus seem to glide by more smoothly, but there’s a real question of whether it’s worth the extra battery drain.
LG G8X ThinQ Software – LG’s skin isn’t the best
The LG G8X ThinQ runs Android 9 and has LG’s custom interface. It offers a few neat extras like the always-on screen mode mentioned earlier, which keeps the time in view, and the ability to dress up the notch area.
You can add a gradient effect to the top half-inch of the screen, keep it bare or black it out.
This kind of customisation seemed appealing back in the early days of notches when they seemed a bit odd and unsettling, but nowadays LG’s bonus gradients seem a little unnecessary, even tacky. Let your own eyes be the judge on this one.

Other parts are raise the question of taste too. The LG interface squishes icons fonts to make text fit in place, and it ends up looking odd. You wouldn’t catch Apple doing this, as its reputation for design relies on tasteful consistency. Fiddling about with the width an aspect of characters is the opposite of this.
LG UX also diverts from “standard” Android in its app drawer style, like some other custom UIs. There’s no app drawer by default, and if you add one it’s arranged in pages rather than as one long scroll.
The G8X ThinQ’s UX interface is one of my least favourite custom Android UIs. It hasn’t developed all that much in the last few years, even though this is a “new” version, and some elements would raise a designer’s eyebrow. But would it stop me buying the phone? Absolutely not.
Android runs well, and if you really don’t like how it looks you can use a Launcher app. These paste over the top layer of an interface with their own. I’ve largely stopped caring about the little software quirks that annoyed me at first.
LG G8X ThinQ Performance – A strong performer
The LG G8X ThinQ has one of the best processors available to Android phones at present. It’s Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855, a Kyro 485-based CPU with an Adreno 640 GPU.
Qualcomm has since released a Snapdragon 855+, to keep the progress train rolling on, but it is effectively an overlocked Snapdragon 855 and performance gains are not huge.
The LG G8X ThinQ’s dual screen add-on lets you test the processor’s power like no other phone. I tried loading up Ark: Survival Evolved and PUBG at the same time, expecting a lot of stuttering. The LG G8X ThinQ can play both games with their graphics maxed-out at the same time and the frame rates are still better than those of some mid-range phones playing just the one title. They are pretty smooth.
This tells you quite how little of the Snapdragon 855 Adreno 640 CPU’s power most Android games actually tap into. Do I want to play Ark and PUBG at the same time? No, but the power to do so is here.

The phone also has 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. There’s nothing to complain about here, but at this point it’s hard to ignore Chinese rivals. The Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro costs around £240 less and has the same specs. The OnePlus 7T, perhaps a more familiar name in the UK and US, has the “Plus” version of the Snapdragon 855 and 8GB RAM. It is around £150 less.
You know how everyone has said for years that China was going to take over pretty soon? We’re seeing that start to happen in phones right now, and it’s hard not to be swayed. You used to have to import Xiaomi phones, but now they are readily available in the UK, complete with the extras we expect in the west, like Gmail – how bourgeois.
LG G8X ThinQ Cameras – We miss the zoom
The LG G8X ThinQ has two rear cameras, an ultra-wide and a standard one. There’s no zoom camera, and I do miss it.
You can pinch to use digital zoom, but even at 2x there’s the same major hit to image quality that has made photographers dismiss this “enlarge and crop” measure since forever. However, the hardware does represent a big upgrade over the LG G7.
Last year’s phone used a 16-megapixel sensor and had a bad habit of leaving big overexposed areas in your images at launch. The LG G8X ThinQ has the 12-megapixel Sony IMX363 sensor, the same used in the Pixel 4 XL.
This is the highlight of the camera line-up. The other two, the ultra-wide and selfie camera, use Samsung sensors (s5kdg1, s5k3m3), and they are rarely anything to get excited about.
The central hardware of the main camera is a match for the Pixel 4XL, but is the image quality? Not quite.

Its processing doesn’t handle fine textures as well and the Night View low light mode is a step below the best. However, you can take excellent photos with the phone. Its colour reproduction is tasteful, dynamic range optimisation is mostly excellent and detail seems great until you compare it directly with the very best phone cameras in the world.

The LG initially looks very detailed, but the texture is more faithful in the other phones. Also, check out the missing vertical lines in some of the upper tiles. The LG is more sharpened and has slightly less detail.
This is a deep crop of a 2/3x image taken of the same scene. There’s no mistaking the phones that have a zoom, and the one that doesn’t
The LG night mode can make very low light images bright but the detail, noise and vignetting are better in the other phones
There are a lot of camera extras packed in here too. For example, you can use the dual screen as a way to review photos without leaving the shooting interface, or as a tilt screen so you can compose from awkward angles. It can also function as an off-centre flash for low-light selfies.
Not all the extras rely on the dual screen case either. There’s an ASMR mode for video that increases mic sensitivity — pretty niche — and an extra-stabilised video mode for shooting action. This uses the ultra-wide camera so there’s masses of spare image data for software stabilisation.
I recommend using the standard mode most of the time, though, as it lets you shoot at up to 4K, 60 frames (the ultra-stabilised mode is limited to 1080p) and already has pretty good stabilisation. Image quality is better too, as the main camera sensor is superior.
The ultra-wide camera is fun to play around with too, but its not one of the best around. Some darker tones take on a purplish hue, and this secondary camera has a fixed focus so is no use for close-ups.
Here are some more sample images:
     
I’m a little disappointed by the front camera too. It uses a 32-megapixel sensor, but tends to leave fine facial hair detail looking soft even in good lighting.
The purpose of all those megapixels is actually for pixel binning, where sensor pixels are clustered to increase sensitivity in lower light. This does work pretty well. The LG G8X ThinQ’s front camera actually holds up better in worse conditions, relative to its major competitors.
LG G8X ThinQ Battery life – Good, but not the best
The LG G8X ThinQ has a 4000mAh battery, which has become the expected size for a large-screen phone. This phone’s longevity is split. Use it without the dual screen add-on and it’s great. One lighter-use weekend day I ended up with 50% charge left.

On more hectic weekdays, I tend to have around 20-30% left. I use my phone fairly intensively during the week, so this is a good result.
However, the dual screen drains the battery quite significantly as it does not have a power source of its own and a second 6.4-inch OLED is not a tiny power draw. For this reason you’ll likely only want to switch the second screen on when needed. The LG G8X ThinQ comes with a fast charger.
Should you buy the LG G8X ThinQ?
Curiosity is one of the best reasons to buy the LG G8X ThinQ. It’s a solid all-round phone for those who want a high-end mobile that costs less than the biggest names, but the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro and OnePlus 7T simply cost less.
The dual screen accessory is the truly unusual part, and it’s a mixed bag. It’s fiddly and a bit buggy, the side-by-side multi-tasking isn’t arguably all that useful. But the virtual gamepad feature is interesting, particularly as LG has gone well beyond the basics. It lets you create your own virtual gamepads, adding only the buttons you need.
I leave the dual screen add-on at home more often than not, but there’s real value here if you use mobile games to make your journey to work less of a chore.
Verdict
A quirky Android phone that should interest mobile gaming fans.

What is the Motorola Moto E6 Plus?
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus is a handset for money-savers, for the young, for the clumsy serial phone smashers. It’s it’s for those smartphone users who want to stay within a budget, who don’t believe in spending a small fortune on a phone.
At £99.99, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus is right near the bottom of your smartphone options from big names. But it’s far better than most that launch at sub-£100.
Its screen is low-res, but surprisingly good. Its body is plastic, but the look is at least “current”.
Gamers are the only group that would be wise to look elsewhere. The Motorola Moto E6 Plus loads titles slowly, can’t play many of them, and doesn’t run them as well as the Moto G7 phones.
But for the basics – and more besides – the Motorola Moto E6 Plus is a charmer, and one of the better Moto E series phones to date.

Motorola Moto E6 Plus design – Modern in many ways, but no so much in others
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus is a most unusual device. It’s a phone with a removable rear, of the type seen in handsets dating back half a decade or more.
This is so rare these days that I spent an hour trying to charge the phone, wondering why it wouldn’t turn on – only to discover the battery wasn’t inside. You’ll find it loose in the box on unpacking the handset.
Some will see this as a blessing. For example, when the battery starts to play up, you can simply buy a replacement and switch it out yourself, rather than having to pay someone to sort it for you.

On the other hand, a sealed in unit is often accomplished in concert with some basic weather-sealing techniques, which give a phone a degree of water-resistance – even if officially has none. Other Motos use a “nano coating” to achieve this effect.
In the rain, we’d advice the Motorola Moto E6 Plus is put in your pocket, since there’s nothing to stop water from seeping into the case and onto those battery connectors.
In this regard, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus really has taken a leaf out of the old-school book of phone design.
However, elsewhere it doesn’t look old-school at all; it’s absolutely a handset that belongs in 2019/2020. It has a tall aspect screen, a neat little display notch and a shiny finish. The rear of the phone is plastic, but it has some of the visual impact of treated glass or buffed metal.
Many of the photos in this review don’t quite show what the Moto E6 Plus looks like on the back, since most are taken with a wide lens aperture, which blurs reflections. The Motorola Moto E6 Plus actually sports a high-gloss finish, like seen below:

This model above is “Polished Graphite”; but it’s also available in a “Bright Cherry” red finish.
The plastic doesn’t feel too fancy, and I’d recommend using the included silicone case. Following a week of use, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus has picked up a number of tiny nicks and scrapes. You could, in theory, buy a replacement battery cover – although these don’t seem to be available online just yet.
I switched to the Motorola Moto E6 Plus from the Google Pixel 3A XL, an “affordable” phone that’s almost five times the price of the Moto. Sure, the plastics used in the Moto are cheaper, but it didn’t seem like a major stylistic downgrade.
However, the buttons on the side of the Motorola Moto E6 Plus feel a cheaper, and while the speaker is loud, it’s also quite thin-sounding, which is common for a phone at this price. The E6 Plus lacks NFC, which rules out the use of Google Pay wireless payments. There’s no compass, either, meaning you won’t see the direction you face in Google Maps, which is quite annoying.

In addition, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus has super-slow micro-USB charging, so you’ll want to recharge overnight. Motorola’s G7 series phones comes with a much faster Turbo Charger.
While I missed that charge speed and the compass, I didn’t miss much else. The Motorola Moto E6 Plus has a solid fingerprint scanner on its rear, a headphone jack, and even face unlock; I recommend using the finger scanner, though, since it’s usually quicker.
Motorola Moto E6 Plus screen – It isn’t perfect, but for the price it certainly impresses
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus has a 6.1in screen. A number of Motorola’s “Plus” phones over the years have been a bit of a handful; they’ve been unsuitable for children and those who find bigger displays a bit of a stretch.
With the E6 Plus, Motorola brings to market a device that’s similar to “normal” phones at a much higher price. Add 1.5mm of horizontal screen border to each side of the Samsung Galaxy S10e and it would feel similar to the E6 Plus.

Still, if you’re buying a first phone for a younger child then you might want to consider the Moto G7 Play. It doesn’t look as slick as the Moto E6 Plus but is slightly smaller when it comes to overall dimensions.
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus’s 6.1in display is one of the best you’ll find at the price, even though its 1560 x 720 pixel resolution doesn’t sound impressive on paper.
Full HD is the optimal resolution for a budget phone, but I didn’t find the pixel drop here obvious. This is a result of two factors. Android seems to be much better at resolution scaling than it has been in the past, applying anti-aliasing to small interface fonts so they look smooth, not blocky. The Motorola Moto E6 Plus’s LCD screen doesn’t make the pixels too visible.

You can see the grid of pixels in some lower-end LCDs, and low-res OLEDs tend to look fuzzy. But here? A perfectly satisfying image.
Even the colour reproduction is sound. Sure, the deep red of the YouTube logo doesn’t have the pop of a higher-end phone, but this is the kind of colour you might see when using the “accurate” mode of a more expensive mobile.
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus has no such customisable modes, most likely because the handset is already maxing out the screen’s capabilities.
There are two shortcomings that show up in day-to-day use. The first is that the Motorola Moto E6 Plus’s screen doesn’t look hugely bright on a sunny day. The second, at times the Auto Brightness mode isn’t good at judging the level required for indoors lighting. Neither should put you off, given the price.
 
Motorola Moto E6 Plus software – It looks like Android One, and is lacking any extras
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus runs Android 9.0, and doesn’t have quite the same approach as the previous Moto E5 range or the Moto G7 family.
Those phones have a light custom interface, but the Motorola Moto E6 Plus’s looks exactly like Android One. The number of Motorola extras is completely stripped back, too.

Almost all Motorola phones, even Android One models, come with a bunch of Moto extras. These include the Moto Display standby screen and gestures such as turning the “flashlight” (camera LED flash) on with a double-flick of the phone. None are present here.
It really does look and feel almost exactly like an Android One phone.

The Motorola Moto E6 Plus has 32GB of storage, but there’s a microSD slot under the back cover. I currently have 7.85GB remaining, having installed a handful of apps, three fairly large games, downloading a few audiobooks and taking 100 or so photos.
Space isn’t limitless, then, but for the kind of person who wants a cheap phone for the basics it will do the job.
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus also has more recent Android features for those who might use those “basics” too often. Google’s Digital Wellness suite is present, allowing you tomonitor and control how much you use certain apps. Disclaimer: some willpower is still required.

Motorola Moto E6 Plus performance – It’s reasonably quick, but this isn’t a device for serious gaming
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus has the MediaTek MT6762 Helio P22 processor, a lower mid-range CPU that can be seen in the Nokia 3.1 Plus.
It’s an octa-core CPU with Cortex-A53 cores and a PowerVR graphics chipset. That’s an ageing core and one of the least common brands of mobile GPUs.
But, on the whole, it gets by just fine. Android 9.0 feels reasonably quick. It isn’t as fast as a mid-range phone, with a short delay to almost all transitions – but these aren’t such that you’ll wish you had something more powerful while simply browsing and looking through Twitter.
Coming from the Google Pixel 3A XL, it’s with app loads that the differences are most obvious. There’s always a little wait for an app to initialise, and that wait can be quite long in the case of some games.

You’ll see these loading pauses more regularly than in other phones, too, because the Motorola Moto E6 Plus has only 2GB of RAM (4GB version available in some countries). Phones use this kind of memory to “park” apps when not in use, to avoid closing them down completely in case you return after a few minutes.
Little spare RAM makes the Motorola Moto E6 Plus close down these parked apps quickly. This isn’t an ideal multi-tasking phone, but I can’t say I’ve found it irritating in this regard. The Honor 7S’s performance made me want to microwave the thing, but the Moto E6 Plus is just fine.
Gaming is a mixed bag – but, again, good enough for the money.

The Motorola Moto E6 Plus doesn’t yet support the Vulkan graphics API, so certain titles such as Ark: Survival Evolved simply won’t work as they should. The game runs, but none of the 3D elements appear.
Asphalt 9 runs but its frame rate is slow enough to seem slightly juddery. PUBG is pretty smooth but will only run at the lower graphics settings, missing out on anti-aliasing and some higher-end textures.
3DMark scores of the Motorola Moto E6 Plus aren’t miles behind some phones that include mid-range Snapdragon CPUs, suggesting some of this passable performance is down to a lack of GPU-specific optimisation.
But for £100? I’m happy with the results here, and I’ll be even happier when/if Vulkan support is added. Such support has been added to previous budget Motos post-launch.
Motorola Moto E6 Plus camera – Day time shots are good, but low-light performance is as you’d expect from a budget handset
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus has two cameras on its rear, giving it an advantage over the slightly more expensive Moto G7 Play.
One is a 13-megapixel sensor and f/2 lens. The other is a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It enables the background blur of the “aperture” mode that sits right at the top level of the custom camera app.

This is a basic camera array that can take some nice-looking photos during the day, thanks to Auto HDR, dynamic range enhancement. The Motorola Moto E6 Plus is no master of colour, or at avoiding blown highlights regardless of the light contrast in a scene. However, on a bright day it can take some pleasant shots.
I’m also reasonably impressed by the background blur mode, and I haven’t been impressed by the Moto version in the past. As usual, there are often messed-up parts of a shot, sections that are blurred that shouldn’t be blurred as a result of the low quality of the depth map. But Lenovo/Motorola seems to have worked on its algorithms in the last couple of years, and can now deliver artistic looking effects even in a sub-£100 phone.

The Motorola Moto E6 Plus’s blur mode also lets you choose the virtual aperture. Its widest f/0.95 setting throws everything out of focus bar your subject, with a pleasing level of progressive blur on show.
In terms of what this camera doesn’t handle so well, low-light performance is poor. Images become super-soft and colour takes on the usual crude look you’ll see from other low-end cameras.
 
Also, in daylight the noise reduction algorithms tend to turn some natural textures such as grass into mush. There’s often too much purple hue in the browns of nature scenes, highlighted by the Motorola Moto E6 Plus’s tendency to slightly overexpose images when there’s no sky in the shot to act as an exposure guide.
 
By manually reducing the exposure you end up with more realistic-looking results in some scenes
Some types of photo also take an age to process. Those background blur images are the clearest example.
Here are some more photo samples:
   
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus has an 8-megapixel selfie camera. I didn’t expect much from this, but it’s great. Shooting selfies indoors with some natural light coming from a nearby window, detail is excellent, skin tones look natural. And you can even use the background blur mode seen in the rear camera view.
The camera holds up well in dark rooms, too, brightening up photos far beyond their “real” level while holding onto a remarkable amount of detail for a sub-£100 phone. These low-light images tend to look a little milky, but I’ve seen worse results from phones double the price.

Why use such a solid selfie camera in a cheap phone? The world loves selfies, and this makes sure the face unlock feature works in all kinds of lighting.
There are no similar surprises in the Motorola Moto E6 Plus’s video. The phone can shoot at 720p or 1080p resolution with either camera, but there’s no software stabilisation and no 4K capture. Video is poor.
Motorola Moto E6 Plus battery life – For light users, it’s fine; but charge times are slow
Unlike the G7 Power, which comes packing a truly huge battery, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus has a 3000mAh unit. As such, it doesn’t last a truly remarkable length of time.
Like most Motos, it’s fine. Moderate use might see it hold onto around 20-30% by bed, but I’ve drained it further most days. This is because use has included a lot of streamed audio, a fair amount of YouTube and some public transport navigation by CityMapper.
The Moto G6 Play or Moto G7 Power are better “low maintenance” phones for light users who want to think about charging as little as possible.
The E6 Plus loses more maintenance points for its ultra-slow charger, mentioned earlier in this review. It’s an extremely slow 5W charger, which is far less powerful than the 15W Turbopower charger included with most of the G-series Motorolas.
This won’t matter too much to light users who charge phones every night. But for those quick top-ups before you go out for the evening, the E6 Plus will power-up at sloth-like speed.

Should I buy the Motorola Moto E6 Plus?
The Motorola Moto E6 Plus is an excellent buy for anyone looking to spend as little as possible on a phone. It may be affordable, but it doesn’t present in that way: it looks good and has a large, fairly high-quality screen that makes movies and casual games look nearly as good as though would on a phone costing five times the price.
There are compromises, of course. It lacks NFC, plus the best phones in the £150-200 range handle some games better and load apps more quickly. And, like every phone at the price, low-light photos are poor.
But at £100, the Moto E6 Plus shows the Moto range at its best – providing a no-nonsense phone for those who want a device that can handle the basics without issue.

Verdict





























 



What looks like a small update on the surface has actually turned out to be an impressive year for the iPhone line. The 11 Pro Max is a great phone thanks to tremendous battery life, a camera array that’s as versatile as anything else on the market and a big screen that makes it a joy to play games on. Of course, all that comes at a price – and this is a seriously expensive phone. Unless you simply must have an OLED display, ultrawide camera and a flashier finish, the regular iPhone 11 might just be a better buy.




Pros

Lovely screen
Fantastic battery life
Triple camera array is among the best we’ve tested
Apple’s services are now more enticing than ever before



Cons

Very expensive
Don’t even bother with the 64GB model
The notch is more obvious now as the competition is beginning to get rid of it

If you want the biggest, longest-lasting Apple flagship of 2019 then the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the phone you want.
This is a true brute of a phone and the size means it’s certainly not for everyone. Thankfully the feature set here is just about identical to the iPhone 11 Pro, so you can really choose whether you want a smaller or larger phone without sacrificing anything.
In this review, I’ll be focussing on what the 11 Pro Max has over its smaller sibling. If you want a more general look at the 11 Pro series take a read of our iPhone 11 Pro review where I go into detail on the excellent camera, design and performance. If you’re after something a little lighter on the wallet then read our iPhone 11 review.
iPhone 11 Pro Max Design – Big and heavy, but very reassuring
The iPhone 11 Pro Max is a big phone. It’s weightier than the iPhone XS Max and stands as the heaviest iPhone Apple has ever made. If you want a dainty device this isn’t for you, the extra weight is immediately noticeable, even if you’re coming from an older Plus or Max phone.
With all that being said, I don’t mind it. The added weight gives the device a satisfying heft and it feels reassuring. Apple has strengthened the glass on both the front and back – using the new dual-ion exchange, as Apple calls it – and made it capable of withstanding being submerged in 4m of water for 30 mins.
Even with this ‘stronger’ glass, I’d still put a case on the 11 Pro Max. The mixture of stainless steel rim and glass give it a delicate feel that I wouldn’t be confident of surviving a drop.

Apple has stuck with a familiar design for the 11 Pro series and around the front things look identical to the XS and X. The notch remains, there’s no home button and the bezel is perfectly the same size all around.
Flip the phone over the changes are a bit more apparent. There’s a new frosted, matte finish that gives way to a larger camera hump. While I love the new feel of the back – even if it’s marginally slippier than before – the camera is housing is certainly an acquired taste.
It looks a lot better in person than in pictures and it’s far less bulbous than I had originally thought. The cameras do stick out a bit though, so you can’t type with the phone on the table without it wobbling all over the place.
iPhone 11 Pro Max Screen – Apple’s best screen on any device?
The 6.5-inch OLED display on the iPhone 11 Pro Max is a thing of beauty. It packs mostly the same specs as the regular 11 Pro (the resolution is slightly different owing to the larger size, however the 458ppi remains the same) but the bigger size makes it much better for watching movies and playing games.
Apple’s name for this display is Super Retina XDR and that XDR branding – which was previously used on the high-end Pro Display XDR – seems to refer to the boost in brightness this phone has over previous iPhones. In certain circumstances, none of which are replicable in our tests, the screen can boost to 800 nits in bright, sunny weather and even further to 1200 nits when you’re playing back HDR content from places like Netflix or iTunes. What I can attest is to is just how gorgeous Dolby Vision movies look on this display. Scenes from Blade Runner 2049 and John Wick 3, especially those in those in the dark, look bright and vivid.

There are a couple of issues, though. It would really have lived up to that Pro tag if Apple had taken the ProMotion tech from its iPad Pro series and shifted it to the OLED display here. ProMotion is an adaptive refresh rate trick that alters how fast the display refreshes each second, upping it to 120Hz (double the typical 60Hz) when required to give it a much smoother look. Having it here would have made it even better.
The screen is also still defined by the notch, which hides the front camera (among other sensors) and juts out just a little bit too much. I didn’t mind the notch a few years when the iPhone X came out, but with Android makers shrinking notches – or getting rid of them entirely – it feels a bit outdated here.
iPhone 11 Pro Max Battery Life  – The endurance king
Apple’s largest current iPhone is also the longest-lasting – and it’s among the best phones out there for easily getting you through the day and into the next. Considering neither iPhone XS model particularly overwhelmed me with their endurance, this is a huge step in the right direction.
It finally feels like Apple has stopped the trend of making things thinner and lighter and sacrificing battery life in the process. The iPhone 11 Pro Max is thicker and heavier than the XS Max but I would take the comforting thought of knowing it’ll virtually impossible (unless you’re purposely trying to) to deplete the cell in a single day.
There’s even a fast 18w USB-C plug in the box that’ll juice the phone up in roughly 100-110 minutes. That’s still slow compared to something like the Huawei P30 Pro or OnePlus 7T Pro, however it’s a lot faster than the old 5w chargers you’d get with all previous iPhones.
iPhone 11 Pro Max Performance and iOS 13 – The A13 Bionic is supremely powerful chip
Apple has long held the finest ecosystem around. The App Store, iMessage, Apple Pay, and the way the phones worked in conjunction with a user’s Mac, made it very hard to leave once you’d got yourself caught up in it. I’d say the decision to leave is now even tougher than ever as Apple’s impressive push with services continues.
You can now add Apple Arcade, Apple Music (which is constantly improving with excellent editorial content and impressive radio offerings), Apple News Plus and the Apple TV Plus streaming service to that list. 
While not all of these are hits – Apple News Plus in the UK is lacking content – the absolute gem of content that is Apple Arcade (and its very reasonable £4.99/$4.99 a month price) makes the iPhone a great place to play some of the best mobile games.
You also should feel fairly confident your phone will last comfortably for a number of years, recieving the latest iOS updates along the way. The A13 Bionic chipset and reported 4GB RAM inside the 11 series consistently tops our benchmarking charts and there doesn’t seem to be any task it doesn’t churn through with ease. That extra power will hopefully come into its own a few years down the line.

Storage sizes remain an iPhone issue, and I don’t think even someone who lives their life majoritively in the cloud will be happy with the 64GB option. At least the jump up takes you to 256GB and you can go as high as 512GB if you want.
iOS 13 got off to a rocky start and there has already been a number of updates to try and iron out the vast array of bugs that didn’t get quashed during the beta period. iOS 13.1 sorted lots of the issues, reducing the number of app crashes and forced restarts I noticed during my first few weeks with the phone.
Bugs aside, iOS 13 is a good update. Dark Mode looks great on the big OLED panel and little extras, like the volume reading no longer taking up the entire screen, have been a long time coming. Apps like Photos, Reminders and Music have also received much-appreciated redesigns.
There might be a lack of 5G here, but at least other networks services on the phone are impressive. Everything from call quality to signal strength is great, and there’s support for latest WiFi 6 standard.
iPhone 11 Pro Max Camera – The most versatile camera system around with great video
We have already reviewed in serious depth the excellent camera array on the back of the iPhone 11 Pro and the triple camera setup here is exactly the same.

Flip the phone over and you’ll find three distinct 12-megapixel cameras. These consist of an ultra-wide angle lens (13mm equivalent, f/2.4), a standard lens (26mm, f/1.8) and a 2x telephoto lens (52mm, with an improved maximum aperture of f/2.0). These three cameras work together to offer a versatile system that shoots some truly fantastic photos.

Ultra Wide (left) vs Wide (right)
The true strength of the iPhone’s camera is how well the three cameras are calibrated to churn out similar photos. Whether you shoot up-close with the 2x zoomed telephoto or zoom out and use the telephoto, the colour processing across all three is very similar and this lets you move between the three with ease.
Of course, the main 12MP sensor is where the best snaps come from. Apple’s Smart HDR feature has been seriously improved this year and the results are sharp, colourful and consistent. I have been shooting with both the iPhone 11 Pro Max and the Google Pixel 4 and the difference is minimal; sometimes I prefer the iPhone’s attempt and other times the Pixel wins out. Considering how far ahead the Pixel was in 2018 it is impressive at what Apple has done this time around.
Detail is fantastic
The portrait mode is good, but not quite as accurate at cutting around details as the Pixel 4
Low light photos are impressive
Night Mode is a new addition for the iPhone 11 series and it’s something I have been wanting on an iPhone since Huawei showed how good it can be with the P20. The iPhone 11 Pro Max’s take on this mode comes on automatically when the light is low and can’t be manually flipped on and off. While I really like not having to worry about flipping to the mode when it’s dark, sometimes I did wish – especially when the light is fading but not completely gone – to have that manual option as a backup.
Night Mode works by shooting a number of short exposures then combining them together to produce a finished image that’s brighter and clearer than a single exposure. The iPhone 11 Pro Max will decide for itself how many seconds to shoot for, but you can use a slider to take control of it. If you attach a tripod you will see the mode jump to the maximum number of seconds.
Video recording has long been one of the iPhone’s biggest strengths and it remains easily the best on any phone you can buy. We’ve got a load more video samples and thoughts on our iPhone 11 Pro camera page so head there for all the details about this camera.

Should I buy the iPhone 11 Pro Max?
What looks like a small update on the surface has actually turned out to be an impressive year for the iPhone line. The 11 Pro Max is a great phone thanks to tremendous battery life, a camera array that’s as versatile as anything else on the market and a big screen that makes it a joy to play games on.

These are the best phones you can buy

Of course, all that comes at a price. This is a seriously expensive phone and unless you simply must have an OLED display, ultrawide camera and a flashier finish the regular iPhone 11 might just be a better buy.
Big, bulky and certainly not for everyone – but if you’re willing to pay the high asking price you’re getting one of the best phones around with impressive battery life and a fantastic camera.

Verdict




























 



Hot on the heels of the Xperia 1, the Xperia 5 is another strong flagship-level phone from Sony, this time offering a slightly better balance between top-end specifications and everyday practicality. The Xperia 5 sacrifices a little of the wow factor for a little more usability – but we’re quite happy with the trade-off.



Pros

(Still) the best camera we’ve seen on a Sony phone
Sony design fairly distinctive
Balanced, attractive OLED display



Cons

21:9 screen has its practical drawbacks
Camera good, but not among the best
Strong rivals at the same price






Key Specifications

Review Price: £699
6.1in 21:9 1080 x 2520 OLED
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC
6GB RAM
64GB w/ microSD up to 512GB
Side-mounted fingerprint sensor
8MP front-facing camera
Android 9.0


The naming, timing, and specifications for the Sony Xperia 5 make it a rather tough handset to pin down. Despite its rather unhelpful nomenclature, the phone trails the Sony Xperia 1 to market by just a few months, and the two phones are unquestionably of the same generation.
However, the Xperia 5 is a slightly more discreet alternative, with one or two thoughtfully downscaled components. At just £699 it’s around £150 cheaper than the Xperia 1, making it a tempting value proposition.
We wouldn’t necessarily call the Sony Xperia 5 the Sony Xperia 1 Compact but… yes, it’s basically the Sony Xperia 1 Compact. And while we’re not entirely sure on its positioning in the wider market, it makes for a very elegant, affordable flagship option.
Sony Xperia 5 design – Tall, slippery, and a little lopsided
The most striking thing about the Sony Xperia 5 design is its height. Thanks to a 21:9 display – one of many traits it shares with its big brother – and slightly thicker top and bottom bezels, it’s far lankier than the likes of the OnePlus 7 Pro, the iPhone 11 or the Samsung Galaxy S10e.
On the positive side, a width of just 68mm means it’s easy to get your hands around it. Conversely, it’s impossible to reach a large chunk of the top of the phone with the thumb of your holding hand.
Clearly aware of this, Sony has included a number of one-handed software workarounds – but they’re just that: workarounds.
Still, I’m glad that it proves so easy to wrap your fingers around the phone, because otherwise I’m certain I’d have dropped it by now. This is one seriously slippery sucker, with a shiny glass back and glossy, slightly rounded aluminium frame.
This vague sense of awkwardness continues when you examine the right edge of the phone. Like the Xperia 1, Sony has crammed all of the Xperia 5’s key buttons onto this one side. In between the volume and power keys is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor – which, in terms of reliability, I found to be a tad hit and miss.
Further down the right side of the phone is Sony’s trademark dedicated camera shutter button. Personally, I always find this latter inclusion to be a welcome one. It’s a handy shortcut to the camera app, and it makes casual snapping feel far more tactile and purposeful than usual.

Overall, though, the right side of the Xperia 1 feels way too busy, while both the left and rear of the phone are relatively underemployed.
This is a pretty light handset at 164g – but, given its compactness, there’s a pleasing density to it all the same. It isn’t up there with the iPhone 11 or the Samsung Galaxy S10 in terms of premium look and feel, though. That isn’t helped by cheap touches such as the bottom-mounted speaker grille and a lack of texture or visual differentiation on those side buttons.
But the one thing we can say in favour of the Sony Xperia 5 design – which was the case with the Xperia 1 before it, too – is that it’s different from its rivals. That counts for a lot.
With an IP65/IP68 dust/water-resistant rating, the Xperia 5 can handle a good amount of water and dust ingress. The presence of Gorilla Glass 6 should ensure that it stands up to minor nicks and scrapes, too.
Sony Xperia 5 display – Super-wide OLED that doesn’t always get to stretch out
If you were to narrow down the difference between the Sony Xperia 5 and the Sony Xperia 1 to just one key features, it would be the display.
Rather than the huge, ridiculously pixel-packed 6.5in 4K screen of the Xperia 1, here we get a 6.1in Full HD+ display. It’s the lesser panel in a couple of key ways, then, but you’d struggle to call it markedly worse in day-to-day usage.
Crucially, this is still an OLED panel, and is therefore still capable of producing eye-pleasing levels of contrast with HDR BT.2020 support. While it might not be the absolute best OLED display you’ll find in a smartphone, the Xperia 5 benefits from Sony’s extensive standards support and image processing prowess.
By default the screen is set to Standard mode, which presents vivid colours and a cooler hue. Creator mode will kick in when the appropriate app is used, providing a more natural and warmer look, utilising the aforementioned BT.2020 colour gamut for movie content.
You can still play ultra-wide video content natively, too, thanks to that stretched-out 21:9 aspect ratio. Of course, the fact that there really isn’t all that much 21:9 video out there continues to be a significant drawback. As things stand, most of the video content you’ll encounter will be in 16:9, creating chunky borders on the Xperia 5 display.

However, getting the right Netflix movie can go some way to justifying the Xperia 5’s awkward display. Blade Runner 2049 looks absolutely stunning here.
One other negative side effect of this stretched-out display is that it can make a 6.1in display feel surprisingly pokey at times. The image might be able to go wider on occasions, but it will always be a little shorter than you might be accustomed to.
We noted in our Xperia 1 review that no phone really needs a 4K resolution, and the Xperia 5 goes to prove it. 1080 x 2520 is more than sufficient at this size, whatever the task. Indeed, it’s significantly sharper than the LCD panel of the similarly priced iPhone 11.
Sony Xperia 5 performance – Predictably speedy performance across the board
Internally, you’re getting the exact same setup as the Xperia 1, not to mention most other 2019 Android flagship phones. The combination of a Snapdragon 855 CPU with 6GB of RAM has been a winner for a number of this year’s best phones.
Sure enough, the Sony Xperia 5 flies along. As you’d expect, general navigation is stutter-free; but advanced tasks don’t seem to tax the phone, either.
Split-screen multi-tasking is one of the big features Sony is pushing with the Xperia 5, as we’ll discuss in a moment. But running two apps simultaneously in this way doesn’t appear to stretch the phone in the slightest.
Games, too, run flawlessly. Call of Duty Mobile runs smoothly with the Graphic Quality settings maxed out to Very High and the frame rate set to Max. It’s a similar case with PUBG Mobile, with the graphics on HDR and the frame rate set to Extreme.
The Geekbench 4 results are predictably strong, with an average single core score of 3472 and an average multi-core score of 10,907. That’s roughly on par with the Xperia 1 and the OnePlus 7 Pro, and a little ahead of the Huawei P30 Pro.
You also get a generous 128GB of internal storage to play with as standard, accompanied by a microSD slot for up to 1TB of expansion.

Sony Xperia 5 software – A fairly faithful take on Android, with a number of tall tweaks
Sony’s custom skin isn’t nearly as cloyingly in-your-face as it used to be. In its present Android 9.0 Pie iteration, this custom UI is actually quite tasteful, sticking far closer to the design philosophy of the stock OS than most of its rivals.
Moving over from a device running on Android One – a completely unembellished take on Android – revealed a very similar experience indeed, from the shape of the app icons to the basic layout of the homescreen and the drag-up operation of the app tray.
The differences largely come through a number of minor cosmetic tweaks, but Sony has added some useful stuff under the hood. For one thing, the company has done its best to modify Android 9.0 Pie for the Xperia 5’s stretched-out 21:9 display.
The most noteworthy of these is Multi-window mode, which lets you run two apps simultaneously side by side – or rather one on top of the other. As a result of the unusually tall screen ratio, neither app in this scenario feels especially squeezed, and the Xperia 5’s punchy internals ensure that there’s no performance penalty either.
Sony has worked to make sure this Multi-window feature is readily accessible, too, even beyond a dedicated Multi-window app. From the app switcher screen you can tap the app icon to place it in split-screen (provided it’s compatible). Notifications often include a Multi-window shortcut, too.
Alternatively, you can access Multi-window through the Xperia 5’s Side Sense function, which is essentially an additional shortcut menu overlay that can be brought up with a double-tap of the very edge of the screen.
The menu itself goes some way to mitigating the effect that tall screen has on one-handed usage. You can gain access to commonly used apps, key notification menu shortcuts such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and the aforementioned Multi-window function with your holding thumb.
You can also enter a full one-handed mode that shrinks the display down. Another related inclusion is the ability to pull down the notification menu from anywhere on the homescreen, which helps mitigate the effects of that tall screen.
Side Sense is great when you can access it. The only trouble is, the double-tap Side Sense command doesn’t work anywhere near reliably enough. There’s a narrow sweet spot on the edge of the screen that’s really tricky to hit consistently. I required the tutorial to show me which area was sensitive to this command, and even then was unable to initiate the function a lot of the time.
Sony’s Dynamic Vibration feature is another case of nice idea, questionable execution. It provides exaggerated haptic feedback to accompany sound, theoretically providing a more visceral and tactile response.
In reality, it’s merely distracting – both to you and to anyone around you, as your phone hums away in the background. I quickly turned the feature off to avoid annoyance and embarrassment.
Elsewhere, Game Enhancer offers you a dropdown overlay that lets you apply a number of custom tweaks when gaming. These include notification settings, and the ability to favour performance or battery life in individual games.
Sony Xperia 5 camera – One of Sony’s best smartphone cameras yet
Despite its nominal junior status, we’re pleased to see that the Xperia 5 comes with exactly the same triple camera setup that impressed us in the Xperia 1 –  a phone that sat in our best camera phones list for a while.
As before, this is arguably Sony’s finest smartphone camera yet, offering features and performance that falls just short of the top tier.
It follows the iPhone 11 Pro in offering three 12-megapixel sensors. Besides the regular wide lens (with a bright f/1.6 aperture), there are f/2.4 telephoto and ultra-wide lenses. The wide and telephoto both pack 5-axis optical image stabilisation (OIS).
It’s worth highlighting the telephoto lens, which manages to take very wide “zoomed out” snaps that are actually usable. There’s far less of the weird distortion effect that you often find on such triple camera systems, and nor do such shots feel markedly different in tone to the others.
From this trio the Sony Xperia 5 can wring some strong results, and in a mixture of conditions. Sadly, there’s no Night mode, but the camera can still take usable – and reasonably natural – shots in limited lighting.
Indeed, natural is the operative word with the Xperia 5 camera. Its shots aren’t especially vivid or punchy, but they do capture decent levels of detail and a realistic tone.
I did observe a tendency to overexpose in the Xperia 5’s shots, particularly on a super-bright day. This was especially so when I took the shot relatively quickly, indicating that the auto-scene selector wasn’t quite keeping pace. I achieved better results when I held the phone for a second or two before pressing the shutter button.
Again, though, it’s nice to have a physical shutter button with which to shoot. I found that the Xperia 5 would reliably lock onto my desired subject, making use of such a physical button viable in the majority of situations.
Sony also provides the ability to adjust white balance and exposure on the fly, so you can quickly and easily take control of the brightness of your shots. Eye AF, meanwhile, is an advanced camera feature that effectively locks onto a subject’s eyes.
I wasn’t particularly enamoured with Sony’s take on a Portrait mode, though. The results failed to make the subject pop, displaying a slightly hazy, smudgy appearance.
The Xperia 5 could be a major contender if you’re after a strong video recorder, however. Sony provides a separate Cinema Pro app that provides fine control over your footage. Think of it as a pro mode for the video function, complete with cinematic looks and full manual control.
Around the front, an 8-megapixel wide camera takes care of selfies just fine, although it’s a shame there’s no Eye AF there too.

Sony Xperia 5 battery life – Fairly normal, but better than the Xperia 1
With the Xperia 1, Sony opted not to follow its rivals and fit a larger battery – a surprising decision given that phone’s 4K display. The result was some fairly unremarkable stamina.
Of course, the Xperia 5 packs a less intensive Full HD+ display. Its 3140mAh battery is only slightly smaller than the 3300mAh unit of the Xperia 1, too.

It’s a net improvement, then, although I still wouldn’t say that it’s downright impressive. A full day of moderate to intensive use would leave around 30% in the tank. That’s fine, if hardly spectacular.
On the media playback front, an hour of Netflix HDR streaming sapped 9% of the Xperia 5’s battery. That’s a significant improvement on the Xperia 1’s 12% under the same strain.
You don’t get wireless charging with the Xperia 5, which is a shame. Still, the presence of an 18W charger in the box is a welcome inclusion.
Should you buy the Sony Xperia 5?
Sony has followed up on the Xperia 1 with the more compact, yet ostensibly similar, Xperia 5. It sacrifices the former phone’s large 4K display for a more manageable and affordable flagship phone.
It retains its elite performance and quirky 21:9 OLED display – although a little smaller and less sharp – as well as the same impressive triple-camera system.
The Sony Xperia 5 isn’t an outright winner, however. For the same price you could secure a OnePlus 7 Pro or an iPhone 11, which both have more desirable hardware and cleaner software.
But this remains one of the best-balanced smartphone packages Sony has produced in years and worthy choice if you’re looking for a best Android phone. 
Hot on the heels of the Xperia 1, the Xperia 5 is another strong flagship-level phone from Sony, this time offering a slightly better balance between top-end specifications and everyday practicality. The Xperia 5 sacrifices a little of the wow factor for a little more usability – but we’re quite happy with the trade-off.

Verdict




























 



Featuring an excellent camera and a completely clean Android 10 install, Google's Pixel 4 is an excellent phone that matches – if not beats – key competitors in a number of areas. It’s not the prettiest phone around, and for the money you can get phones with better hardware, like the OnePlus 7T. But Google’s imaging wizardry and clean software more than make up for this. However, its battery life is way shorter than most competing handsets. 



Pros

Compact design
Excellent camera
Clean Android 10 install



Cons

Below average battery life

If you’re on the hunt for a pure Android 10 smartphone with all the trimmings, the Google Pixel 4 is probably on the top of your shopping list.
The Pixel 4 is, on paper, one of the most interesting phones to arrive this year. It borrows elements from key rivals, like the OnePlus 7‘s Fluid AMOLED screen, but gives them a uniquely Google spin to create a stellar phone that feels like an all round upgrade on last year’s Pixel 3.

There’s a new Pixel in town. Check our full Pixel 4a review to see if this value option is a better buy

Google’s also been very keen to big up relatively niche uses like astrophotography and its new radar sensors, but are these useful enough to justify the price? Plus there are a few niggles with its hardware that stop it being the “shut up and take my money” purchase we’ve been waiting for. Let’s find out why:

Features and Spec

For once it’s not just about the camera

Google Pixel phones have always had one unique selling point that makes up for their fairly sterile designs – industry leading cameras powered by Google’s insanely clever machine learning.
Both of these points remain true on the Pixel 4. Taking the phone out of the box, while I love its dinky dimensions, the phone’s not the best looking on the market. For a start, it’s considerably thicker than most competing flagships, like the Huawei P30 or OnePlus 7T.
It’s also sporting a pretty sizeable top chin and chunky bezels, which feel oh so old-school. Turn it round and it’s a similar story on the back, with it having an impossible to miss, iPhone 11-like square camera housing noticeably protruding from the phone’s rear.
The hardware is also fairly par-for-the-course for a 2019 flagship, with it being powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU paired with 6GB RAM and 64/128GB storage options. If you’re looking for a pretty phone that’s going to set fashionistas or spec-heads tongues-a-wagging, the Pixel 4 isn’t the phone for you.
But, like past Pixels, it makes up for this by ticking all the right boxes when comes to functionality and features. The biggest technical differentiators are the phone’s custom Smooth Display, radar sensor and upgraded recorder app.
At first glance Smooth Display looks like yet another marketing buzzword for the fact the screen has a higher than average 90Hz refresh rate. OnePlus did a similar thing when it described the OnePlus 7 Pro’s 90Hz display as “Fluid AMOLED”.

However, the Google phone’s screen is actually a little smarter than OnePlus’ – because it has the ability to intelligently switch between 60Hz and 90Hz depending on what the phone is doing. This means it’ll jump up to 90Hz when the phone is doing something like competitive gaming, and then drop back to 60Hz when you jump out to check Twitter.
This isn’t the bold jump to loading a true variable refresh rate screen into a phone that I’ve been waiting for, but it’s a clear step in the right direction, and gives the Pixel 4 a clear edge on the competition. For those not in-the-know, a higher refresh and poll rate makes a screen feel smoother and more responsive.
The only downside is that it can seriously impact a phone’s battery as it forces the device to render more images per second. A variable refresh rate lets the phone drop or raise it’s refresh rate to match the users needs, letting you get the benefits of a higher refresh rate when you need it without rinsing the device’s battery 24/7.
The screen itself is also pretty darned good in its own right. Maximum brightness levels aren’t as good as some rivals, like the iPhone 11 and Galaxy S10, but it’s good enough for HDR viewing and has suitably accurate colours – an area past Pixel phones have struggled with.
The radar sensor sits in the phone’s sizeable front chin and has a few different uses. The first is face unlock. This isn’t a unique feature to the Pixel, you’ll find it on most phones including the OnePlus 7T and Huawei P30, but the use of a custom radar rather than camera sensor adds a variety of benefits, chief of which is the ability to use the sensor in the dark.
Best Android phone 2020– does this appear on our list?

During my testing the radar recognised my face in night time conditions with zero hassle – which is a good thing, as the Pixel 4 doesn’t come with any form of fingerprint scanner. This may sound like good news, but at the time of publishing there were ongoing reports the scanner works too well and will unlock even if the users eyes are closed, or by using pictures. Google’s confirmed it’s working on a fix for the bug “in the coming months” but it is a concern nonetheless.
The second benefit, which I’m less sold on, is air gesture controls. This, on paper, seems like a cool feature that enables you do things like skipping songs on Spotify by just by waving your hand in front of the Pixel 4’s screen. It sounds like quite a small thing, but it could be super useful when trying to interact with the phone when doing things like cooking, when your hands regularly get messy.
However, I found the feature is a little hit and miss. When trying to skip songs while kneading dough, I ended up sending flour flying all over my kitchen after repeatedly make a karate chop motion over the Pixel 4’s screen in an attempt to change tracks.
The new recording app is a killer feature if you are the sort of person who makes a lot of voice notes. Normally I wouldn’t spend a lot of time talking about a specific app, but this one merits it. The app has been reworked to offer a real-time transcription service. The feature may have limited appeal, but over the past week I’ve been amazed how well it works.
There are the usual blips, with the occasional malapropism sneaking through, but for the most part the service works very well. This feature isn’t unique to the Pixel 4 though – it’ll be coming to other clean install Android devices including the Pixel 3 when they get upgraded to Android 10. But it’s indicative of an ongoing strength and key selling point for Pixel devices – they come without all the unwanted software and interface “extras” added by the likes of Samsung or Huawei.
As we noted in out Android 10 review, the new OS isn’t a monumental upgrade, but the fact it’s a clean install is a huge bonus. This means the Pixel 4 is completely bloatware free and guaranteed to get software updates to new Android versions in a prompt fashion, making it one of the most future proof phones money can buy.

Camera 

The rear snapper is still pretty boss

The camera also remains a key selling point for the Google Pixel 4. On a hardware front it’s not that exciting, with Google having loaded it with a basic dual sensor 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel rear snapper. This is a far cry from the triple and quad-sensor setups you’ll find on competing flagships, and I had clear concerns about the lack of a dedicated wide-angle lens.
But Google Pixel phones’ photographic excellence has never really been about their hardware. It’s down to Google’s advanced AI and machine learning tech, which gives them next level imaging processing powers. It’s this side that let the single lens Pixel 3 and cheaper Pixel 3a smoke most flagships in low light performance.
Google claims the AI tech has been improved on the Pixel 4, with the second sensor letting it capture even more data than older Pixels. The company hasn’t disclosed all the details about how this has been done, but from my real world experience there have been clear improvements in the line’s already stellar low light performance.
Make no mistake, the Pixel 4 is one of the best camera phones to arrive this year and a clear rival to top dogs Huawei P30 Pro and iPhone 11.
The dual sensor has also been used to add a few nifty features you won’t see on older Pixels. These include basic things like usable 3x zoom and an upgraded night sight low light mode, plus a few next gen features, including the ability to separately adjust the foreground and background’s exposure. The latter is particularly useful when shooting in difficult conditions, like live gigs.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the Pixel 4 below:
  
Does the Pixel 4 have a good camera?

The Pixel 4 has a dual-sensor rear camera that combines 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel parts, and a basic 8-megapixel front camera.
The Pixel 4’s camera is one of the best on the market for low light photography.
The lack of a wide angle lens is an annoyance when shooting nature and city scenes.

The Pixel 4’s camera is a marked upgrade on the single sensor setup seen on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3a. This makes it one of the best currently available, even when compared to stellar competing camera-phones like the iPhone 11 and Huawei P30.
Shooting in regular light the camera app is wonderfully snappy with no noticeable lag between pressing the shutter button and an image being captured.
Photos taken in regular light have decent contrast and don’t look over sharpened, as they can on some competing handsets, such as the Galaxy S10. The app also has a wealth of simple touch up buttons that make it quick and easy to adjust contrast, add vignette effects and generally tweak the image on the fly using easy to understand slider controls.
The custom portrait mode also feels a smidgeon more accurate than the older Pixel 3. Blown up on large screens, portrait shots still suffer from some aberrations but generally the line between the foreground image remains sharp, while the background has a pleasing blur, giving them a noticeably cleaner bokeh.
A number of improvements have also been made to the Pixel 4’s low light photography. Google claims the additional telephoto lens lets the camera take in more data, which its advanced machine learning tech uses to deliver even better low light shots. Google’s also added a Live HDR+ feature that lets you see what HDR+ photos will look like in the viewfinder before taking them when using the phone’s Night Sight mode.
Testing the feature I did see a number of improvements in image quality, particularly when using Night Sight’s new Astrophotography mode — which works to improve image quality when shooting the night sky. But it was never clear when the HDR+ mode was on, which made it tricky to judge how advanced the feature is/if it works.
Video recording works well enough, though captured audio can sound noisy in windy conditions. 4K recording also put a serious drain on the Pixel’s battery and could cause the phone to heat up to uncomfortable levels during prolonged shoots.
The 8-megapixel front camera works brilliantly for video recording and selfies, though the portrait mode is a little less convincing than the rear cameras’.
You can see a side by side comparison of photos captured on the Pixel 4 and iPhone below. Images taken on the Pixel are on the left, slide right to see those taken on the iPhone 11.

Battery Life
All sound good so far? It should, as for the most part the Pixel 4 is an excellent bit of hardware, apart from one key area – it’s pretty bad battery life. I was concerned about this the moment I saw the words “90Hz refresh rate” muttered in the same breath as “2800mAh battery”.
2800mAh is a fairly small capacity, even for a phone this size. This, plus the added power drain a high refresh rate requires, means it’s all too easy to drain the Pixel 4 of its charge with a day of moderately heavy use. Using the phone as my primary entertainment device during a train trip up North, I saw an average power drop of between 7-10% which isn’t bad. But gaming was a completely different story. After only an hour playing PUBG the battery had gone from 60 to 30%, which is pretty darned dire. The same happened when shooting video in 4K.
With regular use I could stretch a day and a half, but the Pixel 4’s battery life is without a doubt shorter than most competing flagships. It is also slower to charge, with Google having loaded it with barebones 18W charging, meaning it can take over an hour for the phone to go from 0-100%.

How long does the Pixel 4’s battery last?

The Google Pixel 4 runs using a 2800mAh battery with 18W charging.
With regular use the Pixel 4 will survive a full day.
The Pixel 4’s battery life is shorter than most competing flagships.

The Pixel 4’s 2800mAh battery isn’t as big as I’d like, even considering the phone’s form factor. This is especially true given the phone screen’s high 90Hz max refresh rate, with regular use I found it offered around a day’s use off a single charge.
Regular use entailed making and taking calls throughout the day, regularly checking incoming messages and my social media feeds, sporadic music listening, a couple of games of PUBG over lunch and watching a couple of cartoons before bed.
More intensive tasks put a bigger drain on the battery, however.
Pixel 4 battery performance video
Streaming video files over Wi-Fi with the screen set to Smooth Display mode and locked to 150 nits, the brightness most people will be comfortable with, the Pixel 4 discharged an average rate of between 7-10% per hour. HDR content put a bigger drain on the battery pushing the figure past 12-14% per hour. Turning off the Smooth Display feature, which locks the refresh rate to 60Hz didn’t impact battery drain when streaming with Netflix, Crunchyroll and Amazon Instant Video.
Pixel 4 battery performance games
Gaming performance put a huge drain on the Pixel 4’s battery, with the Smooth setting on and brightness locked to 150 nits the Pixel 4 lost an average of 25-30% of its charge per hour when running demanding games like PUBG and Asphalt 9.
Pixel 4 battery performance charging
The Pixel 4 only supports 18W charging. This puts it a step behind most competitors. The OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro both support the company’s own, faster Warp Charge 30T tech.
On average, an hour’s charging using included cable and plug took the battery from 0-80%. It took around 90-100 minutes to get the battery up to 100%, which is slow by today’s standards.

Screen

The Google Pixel 4 features a 5.7-inch, FHD+ resolution, OLED, “Smooth Display”.
The 90Hz refresh rate can dynamically switch between 60Hz and 90Hz depending on what the Pixel 4 is doing.
Screen quality is generally excellent, though colour gamut coverage isn’t good enough for creative work.

Google’s Pixel line has never wowed when it comes to screen quality. Past issues have included overcooked colours and generally dirty looking whites, which is why I was surprised quite how good the Pixel 4’s screen is for day-to-day use.
Pixel 4 max brightness
The phone can actually go beyond 422 nits when playing HDR content, which requires a minimum of 600 max brightness. But with normal use that’s the highest figure we recorded. The figure means the Pixel 4 is bright enough to stay legible in everything but extreme bright sunlight. It is significantly lower than the nits level we recorded on key rival flagships, like the iPhone 11.

Pixel 4 black level
OLED screens always have black levels of zero. This is because they generate blacks by stopping charging pixels.

Pixel 4 contrast ratio
The OLED screen’s zero black level means it has an infinite contrast ratio, with real world use the screen looks good, though it doesn’t match the iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10 for dynamic range.

Pixel 4 colour temperature
Colour temperature measures how warm or cool a screen is. 6500K is the ideal temperature where colours look natural. The Pixel 4’s 6421K out-of-the-box colour temperature is excellent as a result.

Pixel 4 gamut coverage
Colour gamut coverage is a metric that’s important to creatives. A higher percentage is always better. The 99% sRGB coverage is excellent and means the screen is accurate enough for regular users. Photographers and video makers looking to shoot and edit on the Pixel 4, which is a rare minority, will likely be less impressed with the phone’s DCI-P3 and Adobe RGB figures, but the figures are still pretty par for the course and not many phones offer better coverage of either gamut.

Should I buy a Google Pixel 4?
If you want a small form-factor, Android-powered camera-phone, then the Pixel 4 is excellent. It’s not the prettiest phone around, and for the money you can get phones with better hardware, like the OnePlus 7T. But Google’s imaging wizardry and clean software more than make up for this. My only major quibble is that the phone’s battery life could be better.

FAQs
Is Google Pixel 4 5G?  No, the Pixel 4 is a 4G phone. Pixel 5 is the first 5G Pixel device.  Is the Pixel 4 dual SIM? Yes, the Pixel 4 can be used with dual SIM. However the second must be an eSIM.

If you’re on the hunt for a pure Android 10 smartphone with all the trimmings, the Google Pixel 4 is probably on the top of your shopping list.
The Pixel 4 is, on paper, one of the most interesting phones to arrive this year. It borrows elements from key rivals, like the OnePlus 7‘s Fluid AMOLED screen, but gives them a uniquely Google spin to create a stellar phone that feels like an all round upgrade on last year’s Pixel 3.

There’s a new Pixel in town. Check our full Pixel 4a review to see if this value option is a better buy

Google’s also been very keen to big up relatively niche uses like astrophotography and its new radar sensors, but are these useful enough to justify the price? Plus there are a few niggles with its hardware that stop it being the “shut up and take my money” purchase we’ve been waiting for. Let’s find out why:

Features and Spec

For once it’s not just about the camera

Google Pixel phones have always had one unique selling point that makes up for their fairly sterile designs – industry leading cameras powered by Google’s insanely clever machine learning.
Both of these points remain true on the Pixel 4. Taking the phone out of the box, while I love its dinky dimensions, the phone’s not the best looking on the market. For a start, it’s considerably thicker than most competing flagships, like the Huawei P30 or OnePlus 7T.
It’s also sporting a pretty sizeable top chin and chunky bezels, which feel oh so old-school. Turn it round and it’s a similar story on the back, with it having an impossible to miss, iPhone 11-like square camera housing noticeably protruding from the phone’s rear.
The hardware is also fairly par-for-the-course for a 2019 flagship, with it being powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU paired with 6GB RAM and 64/128GB storage options. If you’re looking for a pretty phone that’s going to set fashionistas or spec-heads tongues-a-wagging, the Pixel 4 isn’t the phone for you.
But, like past Pixels, it makes up for this by ticking all the right boxes when comes to functionality and features. The biggest technical differentiators are the phone’s custom Smooth Display, radar sensor and upgraded recorder app.
At first glance Smooth Display looks like yet another marketing buzzword for the fact the screen has a higher than average 90Hz refresh rate. OnePlus did a similar thing when it described the OnePlus 7 Pro’s 90Hz display as “Fluid AMOLED”.

However, the Google phone’s screen is actually a little smarter than OnePlus’ – because it has the ability to intelligently switch between 60Hz and 90Hz depending on what the phone is doing. This means it’ll jump up to 90Hz when the phone is doing something like competitive gaming, and then drop back to 60Hz when you jump out to check Twitter.
This isn’t the bold jump to loading a true variable refresh rate screen into a phone that I’ve been waiting for, but it’s a clear step in the right direction, and gives the Pixel 4 a clear edge on the competition. For those not in-the-know, a higher refresh and poll rate makes a screen feel smoother and more responsive.
The only downside is that it can seriously impact a phone’s battery as it forces the device to render more images per second. A variable refresh rate lets the phone drop or raise it’s refresh rate to match the users needs, letting you get the benefits of a higher refresh rate when you need it without rinsing the device’s battery 24/7.
The screen itself is also pretty darned good in its own right. Maximum brightness levels aren’t as good as some rivals, like the iPhone 11 and Galaxy S10, but it’s good enough for HDR viewing and has suitably accurate colours – an area past Pixel phones have struggled with.
The radar sensor sits in the phone’s sizeable front chin and has a few different uses. The first is face unlock. This isn’t a unique feature to the Pixel, you’ll find it on most phones including the OnePlus 7T and Huawei P30, but the use of a custom radar rather than camera sensor adds a variety of benefits, chief of which is the ability to use the sensor in the dark.
Best Android phone 2020– does this appear on our list?

During my testing the radar recognised my face in night time conditions with zero hassle – which is a good thing, as the Pixel 4 doesn’t come with any form of fingerprint scanner. This may sound like good news, but at the time of publishing there were ongoing reports the scanner works too well and will unlock even if the users eyes are closed, or by using pictures. Google’s confirmed it’s working on a fix for the bug “in the coming months” but it is a concern nonetheless.
The second benefit, which I’m less sold on, is air gesture controls. This, on paper, seems like a cool feature that enables you do things like skipping songs on Spotify by just by waving your hand in front of the Pixel 4’s screen. It sounds like quite a small thing, but it could be super useful when trying to interact with the phone when doing things like cooking, when your hands regularly get messy.
However, I found the feature is a little hit and miss. When trying to skip songs while kneading dough, I ended up sending flour flying all over my kitchen after repeatedly make a karate chop motion over the Pixel 4’s screen in an attempt to change tracks.
The new recording app is a killer feature if you are the sort of person who makes a lot of voice notes. Normally I wouldn’t spend a lot of time talking about a specific app, but this one merits it. The app has been reworked to offer a real-time transcription service. The feature may have limited appeal, but over the past week I’ve been amazed how well it works.
There are the usual blips, with the occasional malapropism sneaking through, but for the most part the service works very well. This feature isn’t unique to the Pixel 4 though – it’ll be coming to other clean install Android devices including the Pixel 3 when they get upgraded to Android 10. But it’s indicative of an ongoing strength and key selling point for Pixel devices – they come without all the unwanted software and interface “extras” added by the likes of Samsung or Huawei.
As we noted in out Android 10 review, the new OS isn’t a monumental upgrade, but the fact it’s a clean install is a huge bonus. This means the Pixel 4 is completely bloatware free and guaranteed to get software updates to new Android versions in a prompt fashion, making it one of the most future proof phones money can buy.

Camera 

The rear snapper is still pretty boss

The camera also remains a key selling point for the Google Pixel 4. On a hardware front it’s not that exciting, with Google having loaded it with a basic dual sensor 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel rear snapper. This is a far cry from the triple and quad-sensor setups you’ll find on competing flagships, and I had clear concerns about the lack of a dedicated wide-angle lens.
But Google Pixel phones’ photographic excellence has never really been about their hardware.

Verdict




























 



At a price of less than £300, the Nokia 7.2 is a classy customer. We like its sleek but practical design and sharp display, while Android One continues to do wonders with relatively limited hardware. It’s an accomplished phone in most respects. What keeps the Nokia 7.2 from glowing praise is its patchy triple-camera system, which suffers from some inconsistent results and an ineffectual Night Mode.



Pros

Tidy and tough polycarbonate design
Clean Android One software
Flexible, impressively specced camera



Cons

Camera extremely inconsistent
Night Mode ineffective
Battery life pretty ordinary

The Nokia 7.2 joins a growing roster of phones offering one or two stand-out components in a stylish body at a reasonable price.
For just £249 you’re getting an all-round capable phone with an eye-catching triple-camera and none of the custom UI bloat that you might associate with efforts from Samsung and Huawei/Honor.
It’s undoubtedly the most interesting device from Nokia’s late–2019 litter, thanks to its mass-market appeal and just-so specifications. Ultimately it falls a little short in a couple of areas, but the Nokia 7.2 is a solid pick for anyone on a sub-£300 budget.
Nokia 7.2 Design – Plastic fantastic, if a little derivative
Since its HMD Global-led smartphone relaunch, the Nokia brand has created a raft of quietly appealing devices without ever recapturing the iconic design flair of its heyday.
The Nokia 7.2 doesn’t threaten to overturn that trend, but it is one of the best-looking phones that Nokia has produced in a while.

One design decision that has us fondly recalling the brand’s previous output is the Nokia 7.2’s all-polycarbonate design. No-one could make plastic feel as premium as Nokia in its pomp, and a little of that moulding magic is present here.
From the smooth black plastic of the rim to the slightly hazy matte finish of the rear panel, this is a phone that makes a virtue of its materials. You might even call it ‘unapologetically plastic’.
We were certainly thanking Nokia for its choice of materials when our test unit took a tumble from chair-height onto the hard floor of a restaurant. There wasn’t so much as a ding or a scratch on its hardened stealth-black surfaces.
While it’s tough and pleasant to hold, we wouldn’t call the Nokia 7.2 design remotely original. From the front it could be any number of low to mid-range phones, with its simple shape and dewdrop-notched display. Only the Nokia symbol on its slightly chunky chin gives the game away.
The back of the Nokia 7.2 reminds us of the Motorola G7 and other efforts from the Lenovo-owned brand, what with that pronounced circular camera module at the top centre of the device. Below that is a reliable, speedy-enough fingerprint sensor.
Beyond a general lack of creak and flex, the other reason the Nokia 7.2 doesn’t suffer for its choice of plastic is that it feels pleasingly hefty. At 180g it’s not unmanageably weighty by todays standards, but you certainly know it’s there.

The selection of side buttons is notable for two reasons. One is is that the power button on the right edge contains the phone’s notification light, softly glowing white when you receive a message.
On the opposite edge is the real point of interest here – an extra button dedicated to Google Assistant. If you’re fully sold on Google’s voice-activated helper, it’s pretty handy being able to jump to it from sleep with a simple button press.
If not, you’re more likely to be annoyed by how easy it is to mis-press it when fumbling for your phone or attempting to take a quick picture with the camera.
It’s all good news on the other two edges. The bottom edge contains a modern USB-C port, while the top edge houses a 3.5mm headphone jack. Praise be.
Nokia 7.2 Display – Large, sharp and punchy at the price
Nokia has given the 7.2 an accomplished 6.3-inch IPS LCD display, the same display tech found in many of the best mid-range phones and best cheap phones. It’s an undeniably large screen, and you won’t be pulling that notification tray down from the top of the screen with your holding hand.
But it’s well proportioned to the extent that it’s great for pretty much everything without making the phone particularly unwieldy.
That sense of proper proportion is present in the display’s 1080 x 2280 Full HD+ resolution too. It’s not as pixel-dense as flagship Android phones like the Galaxy S10, but it’s just right for displaying 1080p content.

There’s HDR10 support, and Nokia’s PureDisplay technology lays on a Pixelworks processor for upscaling SDR to HDR. It’s not the most pronounced contrast on a phone – this is still an LCD after all – but video content from Netflix and Amazon Video pops pleasingly nonetheless.
You don’t tend to get too much intrusion from the Nokia 7.2’s dewdrop notch either. One positive element of the phone’s more pronounced chin is that modern widescreen movie and TV content squares off just before the notch, providing a full picture without making the phone look lopsided.
Another facility is Night Light, which tints the screen to an amber hue to reduce sleep-disrupting levels of blue light when using the phone at night. This can be set to turn on at certain times, or just from sunset to sunrise, and it’s also possible to adjust the intensity of the effect.
Nokia 7.2 Performance – A capable mid-range performer
The Nokia 7.2 runs on Qualcomm’s mid-range Snapdragon 660 CPU. It’s not a top tier chip, but it provides a smooth and stutter-free experience in general navigation and light tasks.
This is the same chip as the one that impressed us in the Xiaomi Mi 8 Lite, the Xiaomi Mi A2 and, indeed, the Nokia 7 Plus. Not the newest chip, then, but still a capable performer.
Even when you throw advanced applications like multitasking and high-end 3D games at the Nokia 7.2, it copes admirably. We were able to crank Call of Duty Mobile’s settings up to Medium Graphic Quality and High Frame Rate (the maximum settings available on this phone) and its frenetic FPS action ran fluidly.

PUBG Mobile, meanwhile, ran just peachy on HD and High Frame Rate settings, even though it defaulted to Medium settings.
This comfortable level of performance is reflected in the Nokia 7.2’s Geekbench 4 benchmarks. A single core score of 1612 matches the Pixel 3a’s 1622, while a multicore score of 5889 beats Google’s mid-range handset on 5209.
On the storage front, there are 64GB and 128GB models of the Nokia 7.2 out there, which is ample. Especially when you factor in a microSD slot for up to 512GB of expansion.
Nokia 7.2 Software – Android One is gloriously clean
The Nokia 7.2 runs on and Android 9.0 Pie, which is no longer the very newest version of Google’s software. You can be assured that it will receive Android 10 in short order, however, because this is an Android One phone.
Like the Nokia 6.2 and the Motorola One Action before it, the Nokia 7.2 runs on an incredibly pure take on Android. The only major addition from Nokia here is its own camera app.

This contributes massively to the Nokia 7.2’s slick, smooth, premium feel. With none of the bothersome UI tinkering of most of its rivals, the Nokia 7.2’s software is visually cohesive and thoroughly intuitive.
All of the core apps that come preinstalled on the Nokia 7.2 (apart from the camera app) are Google originals. That again aids with the cohesiveness of the Nokia 7.2 experience. But beyond that, Google’s apps are simply very good at what they do.
It also means that you don’t get any tiresome duplicate apps – so no email app on top of Gmail, and no calendar app other than Google Calendar. Google Photos takes care of your pictures, not some generic Gallery app.
If you don’t like Google’s default offering, you can just download an alternative from the Google Play Store, which is exactly as it should be most of the time.
Android One also means that you’re guaranteed regular security updates for three years, and Android OS updates for two years. That’s why we’re so confident on that Android 10 point.
Nokia 7.2 Camera – Well specced but disappointingly inconsistent
Nokia and HMD appear to have paid a lot of attention to the Nokia 7.2’s camera setup. It’s an impressive-sounding triple-camera system with a 48-megapixel primary sensor, an 8-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor.
This results in an incredibly flexible camera that, together with a fully featured camera app, covers most of the bases of a modern flagship. It can take both zoomed-out shots and portrait shots with exaggerated bokeh. There’s a Night Mode and a Pro mode, and an AI facility that chooses the scene for you.
In practice, however, it’s all a bit hit-and-miss. In great lighting, the primary 48-megapixel sensor (which actually shoots 12-megapixel images by default) is capable of capturing very good shots, with balanced colours and plenty of detail.
But you never fully know what you’re going to get in mixed conditions. We experienced multiple instances where the camera would lock on to completely the wrong subject, or even nothing at all, resulting in a weird impressionistic smudge.
The shutter speed seems weirdly laggy and wallowy at times, and we got various images that seemed to capture our human subject mid-blink.
What’s more, the ultrawide camera takes images of such inferior quality compared to the main sensor, with grainy edges and a more washed out tone, that you’ll probably find yourself using it less and less.
Low light image quality isn’t great either, with large amounts of noise and the odd random ghosting effect. Night Mode simple isn’t up to the standard of rival efforts from Google and Huawei, with disappointingly noisy results that often turned out worse than those shot in regular auto.
Night Mode is said to be able to detect when you’re using a tripod to steady it and bump up the exposure time accordingly. But who uses a tripod with their phone – especially an affordable one like this?
The AI scene selector is another welcome inclusion, but it isn’t the smartest we’ve seen. Occasionally it would select indoors when I was shooting outdoors, animal when I was shooting a static object, and so on.
Oh, and there’s also a 20-megapixel front-facing camera here. It takes pretty mediocre selfies, and it has one of those ugly beautifying filters on it. You can get better, but it’s fine for a phone at this price.
A fair chunk of this can be excused by the Nokia 7.2’s sub-£300 price tag. Like we said, it’s possible to take very good shots with this phone’s camera. But it’s the weird inconsistencies that really give us pause here. Especially when you consider how much better and more consistent the Pixel 3a camera is for around £100 more, not to mention the reliable cameras from the Huawei/Honor stable.
Here’s a selection of photos taken on the Nokia 7.2:
The Nokia 7.2 struggled to focus on the intended subject
Night-mode often seems to take detail and balance out of a dark scene
A nicely captured blue sky
The detail and colour tone here is pretty on point
A nice, detailed shot of Florence with the main sensor
Zoom out and the results are more washed out
The main sensor can capture vibrant shots with lots of depth
The AI scene selector correctly picked out this food photo
A reasonably well picked-out low-light scene, though it failed to capture the full pinkness of the sky
Nokia 7.2 Battery life – Comfortable daily usage, but go easy on the media
The ample body of the Nokia 7.2 has been filled with a pretty capacious 3500mAh battery. While Nokia reckons you’ll get two days of usage out of it, we didn’t find it to be quite so capable.
In general mixed usage, it’s pretty average. It’s not up there with the likes of the Huawei P Smart 2019 on the battery life front, but it shouldn’t fail you before the day is out.
We were able to get through a busy day of holiday photography that went on fairly late into the night, and went to bed with around 25% left in the tank.
It’s media consumption on that fancy PureDisplay that seems to do for the Nokia 7.2. Playing 15 minutes of Guns of Boom with the screen brightness set to half drained 7%, which is definitely at the high end of the kind of drain we’re used to. Elsewhere, 15 minutes of Netflix streaming with the brightness at full sapped 5% of the charge.
While the Nokia 7.2 is pretty good at displaying visual media, you’ll want to be a little careful with how much you do. It takes its toll.
The phone also packs Qualcomm Quick Charge support, though the 10W charger that comes bundled with it is nothing to write home about. The similarly priced Moto One Vision, for example, ships with a 15W charger.
Should I buy the Nokia 7.2?
Nokia has created a stylish, well-equipped smartphone at a sub-£300 price tag. Its sleek and sturdy design and clean Android One OS make it worthy of consideration if you want the class and poise of a flagship for much less.
The Nokia 7.2 also packs a very accomplished 6.3-inch display, which is a great outlet for media content. While its Snapdragon 660 CPU is far from new or cutting edge, it gets the job done.
As long as you don’t believe the blurb on its underwhelming camera, the Nokia 7.2 is well worth considering.
Verdict
At a price of less than £300, the Nokia 7.2 is a classy customer. We like its sleek but practical design and sharp display, while Android One continues to do wonders with relatively limited hardware. It’s an accomplished phone in most respects. What keeps the Nokia 7.2 from glowing praise is its patchy triple-camera system, which suffers from some inconsistent results and an ineffectual Night Mode.

Verdict




























 



The Nubia Z20 is the best dual-screen smartphone we’ve used to date; its specs are fresh, it looks slick and its cameras are decent, too. Like Xiaomi’s Black Shark 2, its UI lacks polish, with Chinese text, caller ID issues and poor translation holding it back. This relegates the Z20 to ""one for enthusiasts"". But if you can deal with those niggles, at £499 it’s a well-priced, novel bit of kit and a true gadget. 



Pros

A decent two-screen experience
Great battery life
Powerful yet affordable



Cons

No NFC
UI lacks polish
No SD card slot

What is the Nubia Z20?
Remember the Yota Phone or the Yota Phone 2? They were two of the first devices to place a screen on the rear of a smartphone – and, well, they tanked. 
Fast-forward to early 2019, and ZTE launched the Nubia X in select markets. An innovative dual-screen smartphone, and despite the fact that the X showed promise, it wasn’t quite a smash hit. 
A generation later, and the Nubia series has a new dual-screened flagship in the Nubia Z20 – and this one is a comparative winner, with a OnePlus 7T Pro-esque design and a triple-camera system.
So why the two screens? There’s no need for a selfie camera on the Z20 as the rear screen turns into a 5.1in viewfinder. In addition, the second screen uses less battery, and it’s kinder to your eyes too.
Also getting things off to a great start, the Nubia Z20 is the cheapest Snapdragon 855 Plus smartphone around. Its rock-bottom £499 price undercuts all the OnePlus 7T-series, the ROG Phone 2 and the Black Shark 2 Pro.
Nubia Z20 design – OnePlus from the front, Nubia from the back
From the front, the Nubia Z20 looks very like a OnePlus 7 Pro. It has a curved Gorilla Glass screen, front cameras and it’s free of notches. There are also glimmers of shiny blue that glint from its polished frame – trés OnePlus.
Flip the device around, though, and it’s unlikely that you’ve seen anything like this Nubia before. It has three cameras that are stacked horizontally, and all are book-ended by two LED flashes on either side. There’s an earpiece on the rear, too, so you can take calls whichever way the Z20 is facing. And as for its party trick, press power and a sharp, vibrant, punchy second screen beams below the camera surround. 
How does the Nubia know which way to fire up? Using sensors: whichever screen is facing up will be the one that switches on. Genius… except for when you’re lying in bed upside down. 

The Z20 also has a power button/fingerprint scanner on either side, each just over half-way up the phone. Register a finger or thumb on one, whichever you choose to use, and you can get into your Z20 securely and quickly – excellent for left- and right-handed folk alike.
A mono speaker can be found at the base of the phone, along with a USB-C port. While there’s no headphone jack, ZTE provides a dongle in the box, as well as a case. You’ll also be thankful of the two pre-fitted screen protectors – one either side – that ensure the phone’s Gorilla Glass 5 displays are sufficiently shielded.
Ultimately, the ZTE Nubia Z20 looks great and feels premium. As is the case with most phones today, all that glass is a bona fide fingerprint magnet – but for £499, ZTE has hit the target when it comes to fit, finish and affordability.
Nubia Z20 Screen(s) – Saving eyes and selfies with dual displays
The main screen on the Nubia Z20 is a curved 6.42-inch AMOLED panel, with a 1080 x 2340 resolution and 401ppi pixel density. That’s on a par with the P30 Pro in terms of specs, and a bit sharper than an iPhone 11; it’s less sharp than an iPhone 11 Pro. 
Indoors, its max brightness is 430 nits, which is solid. Outdoors, that climbs to 600 nits. These figures put the Nubia Z20 behind phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, which has a peak maximum brightness of over 1000. This means that although viewable in most conditions, you might struggle to see the screen on the Nubia Z20 if the sun is in full glow. 
Viewing angles still manage to be great, and the lack of a notch means the Nubia Z20 is an immersive, zingy dream to game on. Saturation is punchy; there are two viewing modes: colourful and natural. There’s also a Night Light feature, which adds a warm hue to things. By default, the display is definitely cool in tone, so we kept this active on low intensity throughout the day.

Flip it around, and the screen on the rear can act as an always-on display (AOD), showcasing the time when the phone is face down. A nice touch – you don’t expect it to go from a humble clock to a 5.1-inch499 720 x 1520 AMOLED pane, so when it does, it’s very cool indeed. The second screen is sharp with a 330ppi pixel density. It’s super-responsive and supports some smart screen modes to take eye-care to the next level.
Within the settings, there are four levels of eye care for the rear display: Basic, Light, Medium and Super. Basic filters small amounts of blue light, and Super makes everything monochrome; according to ZTE, it ‘simulates paper’. 
There are inherent colour integrity issues with the second screen; it’s shining through either black or blue glass. We’d urge anyone using the rear screen for editing photos, or any other task that relies upon colour accuracy, to turn the phone around. The rear screen’s maximum brightness is also a lowly 330 nits, which makes it unusable in bright sunlight.

Still, as an added bonus, a selfie viewfinder and our go-to screen when in the cinema or a dark room, it’s a welcome addition. Plus, throughout our time with the device, the screen was noticeably kinder to our eyes.
Nubia Z20 performance – An unintentional gaming phone
The ZTE Nubia Z20 is the most affordable Snapdragon 855 Plus smartphone available at the time this review is being written. Paired with 8GB of RAM, it’s on a par with pricier phones such as the OnePlus 7T Pro.
Not surprisingly, when it comes to benchmarks it flies, scoring 371,697 in AnTuTu and 5678 in 3DMark: Sling Shot Extreme. Geekbench hasn’t been optimised for the phone, so wouldn’t fire up when we tried to run it – but the other benchmarks and real-world findings place it in the upper echelon of gaming choices.
Its mono speaker and lack of headphone jack don’t do it any favours, but the points it loses in those areas it makes up for by excluding a notch or punch hole, thus delivering a punchy, all-screen gaming experience.

Meanwhile, the two fingerprint scanners on either side of the phone both work well, even if under-display scanners would have been preferable. The phone’s 128GB storage is respectable; however, the lack of a microSD card slot might put off  the file-hoarders out there. 
But the real downer when using the Nubia Z20 out and about is the lack of NFC. This rules out contactless payments, one-touch pairing and Android’s native tap-to-share.
If you’re okay with that omission, though, the Nubia Z20’s performance punches above its price nicely. 
Nubia Z20 battery life – Second screen for the win
The Nubia Z20’s 4000mAh battery might not be dethroning battery champs such as the ROG Phone 2 or Mate 30 Pro anytime soon, but it’s still an all-day phone with juice left in the tank by bedtime. 
Thanks to 27W fast charging, the Z20 charges swiftly. It will get you up to 30% battery in 20 minutes, 50% battery in 30 minutes, and 86% battery in an hour. As for a full charge, that takes just under an hour and a half. 
A 30-minute video clip at maximum brightness drained the rear display by 5%, and the main display by 6%. That said, with Super Eye Care fired-up on the rear display, the same video consumed just 3% of the battery, even at maximum brightness. As such, for peak battery performance use the rear screen with Super Eye Care to significantly improve your Z20’s screen-on time.

Nubia Z20 software – Stock-ish Android 9
Running Android 9, ZTE has decided against loading up the Z20 with the latest version of Android. This is a shame, but it will still deliver excellent app support thanks to Google Play Store access.
The interface is relatively stock and simple. Swipe up and your Applications Tray swings into the screen; swipe down from the top to access your notifications and quick toggles; swipe left and right to browse through your homescreens. Icons are square by default – although they are customisable – and there’s a dark theme option, too. 
While we experience no judders or stalls in our month with the Nubia Z20, we did experience a few of quirks. For starters, the GameSpace feature, which isolates the games installed within one menu, force closed about three times. Additionally, the phone app was frequently unable to identify callers. As such, when the phone rang, we were being called by “Unknown” about 50% of the time – an annoying quirk that will hopefully be resolved in a software update.
Otherwise, performance was respectable and it ran a custom launcher without any issues. ZTE also loads up squeezy tech on the Nubia Z20, just like the Google Pixel 3, enabling two customisable commands: one with a long-squeeze; another with a short-squeeze. 
Nubia Z20 second screen – Fumble-tastic, but easy on the eyes
As for what the second screen is like to use in the real world, it’s novel and fun – but it isn’t going to transform the way you use your phone.
When you boot up the Nubia Z20 for the first time, you can switch to the second screen by pressing a floating icon. We didn’t like this sticky dot drawn over our apps, so disabled it in favour of a notification shade switcher, which was much tidier.
Next up, we come to this screen’s functionality. It can either act as a second space, displaying something different to the main screen, or mirror it directly when you swap over. When you come to take a selfie, it swaps to the rear screen automatically, and this can result in a fumble if using the phone one-handed.

When gaming on the main display or playing music, the second screen can display a light show, so everyone around you knows you’re having a great time – it isn’t something we’d use, but you might dig it.
Finally, there’s a fair bit of customisation available for the Nubia Z20’s always-on display (AOD). You can set a clock, some notification information, or even a picture of your choosing to display on either the front or rear display when the phone is on standby. 
Nubia Z20 camera – No selfie camera, great selfies
The Nubia Z20, like the Asus ZenFone 6, doesn’t feature a selfie camera per se. Instead, the device uses the main 48-megapixel rear camera to take selfies – although, unlike the ZenFone, this camera packs OIS.

That camera combines with an ultra-wide, 16-megapixel (f/2.2) unit and a telephoto, 8-megapixel (f/2.4) – roughly – 3x zoom camera.
Detail from the main camera is strong. ZTE doesn’t sharpen images as much as Samsung, so while they look a little softer, they look more natural. Dynamic range isn’t as broad as top-tier flagships such as the Mate 30 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro, but with lower contrast across images than the OnePlus 7T, for example, there’s more nuance in blacks and darker spots. Some images do run the risk of looking more washed out, though, so if you like eye-popping shots then you might want to boost saturation yourself after the beat.
Detail is strong
Low-light performance is strong for a phone of the Nubia Z20’s price, both in Automatic mode and Night mode – although this doesn’t cover the telephoto and ultra-wide cameras, which should both be avoided in challenging conditions.
Night mode
Auto mode
Generally speaking, the telephoto shooter is handy. However, it produces soft shots with heavy noise reduction. The ultra-wide camera works well in the day, but poorly at night. 
We can’t wrap up talking about photos without mentioning the Z20’s impressive macro mode, with capture as near as 2.5cm. You can see for yourself in the sample of the flower stamen, it captures impressive detail, even in artificial lighting.
Video is shot at up to 8K resolution (beta), which is bonkers – especially given the files don’t even play using VLC Player on a Core i9 machine; but they can be ingested into Premiere Pro. Having said that, actual frame rates of 8K footage are poor, so we’d avoid it altogether. 
Image stabilisation across resolutions from 1080p 30fps through to 4K 60fps is fair, but not great. As such, you’d be wise to place the Z20 on a steady surface or gimbal when you can. Focus is fine, but can hunt a bit mid-capture, more so in artificial light. 
It may not be the best rear video camera around, then, but the Nubia Z20’s unit is one of the best selfie video cameras – with the rear screen firing up, OIS kicking in and sharp footage at up to 1080p available (we’re not sure why ZTE doesn’t enable 4K selfie video capture). In addition, thanks to the rear flashes, selfies can be illuminated relatively evenly should the need arise, making it a selfie cam for almost all lighting conditions.
Should I buy the Nubia Z20?
The Nubia Z20 is far from perfect – caller ID bugged out on us in our time with the phone, and the UI lacks the finesse of other interfaces such as Oxygen OS. That said, the phone represents great value at £499 given its powerful internals, and for gadget fans who dare to be different, the Nubia Z20 and its second screen tick boxes we never even knew needed ticking.

What is the Oppo Reno 2?
The Oppo Reno 2 is a mid-range phone that more-or-less provides everything you might ask for from a higher-end model. It looks and feels expensive, has five cameras, an excellent screen and in-screen fingerprint scanner.
Why might you choose to pay more? Some phones have more powerful processors, although the actual difference won’t seem huge for many. The camera is good but not class-leading. And Oppo’s ColorOS software won’t please everyone.
However, if you want some high-end class while spending less than phones like the OnePlus 7T and Samsung Galaxy S10e cost, it’s a great choice.

Oppo Reno 2 Design – A sleek and classy finish, with a headphone jack and pop-up camera
Only one design motif separates the Oppo Reno 2 from phones in the £800-1000 range. It’s curved front glass. This is used by companies like Samsung and Apple to make their expensive phones look and feel more expensive, and it works.
The real benefit? Curved front glass tends to make a phone seem thinner than it is. And the Oppo Reno 2 feels relatively thick, but it has a trick to improving the feel too. The phone actually tapers slightly top-to-bottom, from 9.5mm thick to 8.5mm.
If it was 9.5mm all the way down, it would feel outright chunky, but I think it’s more-or-less a delight. The curved Gorilla Glass on the back is smooth and hard, and has that unmistakeable cool feel of glass when you pick it up, having left it out of your pocket for a while.

Oppo’s finishes are classy too. This version is Ocean Blue. The Oppo Reno 2 also comes in a light “Sunset” pink and black.
You’ll notice the cameras do not protrude at all, like those of the last Reno. The rear glass functions as the outer camera lens cover. This is why there’s a little metal dimple below those cameras. It stops the camera glass from touching any flat surfaces you rest the Reno 2 on, while only causing a tiny bit of wobble.
The Oppo Reno 2 is one of the best-looking phones at the price, and it feels more high-end than most too. But there are lots of nods to plain and practical considerations too. The Reno 2 has a great factory-applied screen protector and comes with a faux-leather clip-on case.
Using it obliterates most of the effort put into making the Reno feel fancy, but you probably should use it. Even Gorilla Glass, used here, will pick up scratches. There’s also no official water resistance. Don’t drop it in the bath.

The Oppo Reno 2 also has a headphone jack, missing from almost every phone as fancy as this one.
There’s a very fast optical fingerprint scanned embedded in the screen. And, like the Reno and OnePlus 7 Pro, the pop-up front camera is fast enough to make the snappy face unlock mode a viable option.
This front camera is perhaps the primary part of the Reno series’s visual personality. It’s a wedge of metal that pops up like a shark fin when you use face unlock or the selfie camera. As Apple and Samsung still use non-motorised designs, this style still has a charming novelty to it.

Oppo Reno 2 Screen – Notch-free and Netflix HD-ready
The front camera also leaves the 6.5-inch screen free of any holes or notches. This is a huge advantage for video streaming, as notches and the black blobs of punch hole screens are always distracting.
The Oppo Reno 2 is a brilliant Netflix phone. And unlike the cheaper Reno 2 Z, it is certified for Netflix HD streaming at launch (like other Androids this means Netflix plays at 720p).

There’s very little to complain about on image quality either. The Oppo Reno 2 has a 2340 x 1080 pixel AMOLED screen. Its emissive pixels mean blacks look pitch black even if you watch in a room darker than a cinema, and great colour depth is here, if you want it.
The phone has two colour modes – Gentle and Vivid. Gentle is based on the sRGB colour standard, so is less bold than the norm, but does tend to result in more natural-looking skin tones. Vivid boosts colour, giving images a bit more pop and power. Both look great, and simply cater for different tastes.
Peak brightness does not match, say, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10’s ~700 nits. But the Reno’s ~500 nits is enough to make the screen look fairly clear on bright days.

Oppo Reno 2 Software – ColorOS won’t be for everyone
The Oppo Reno 2 runs Android 9 and Oppo’s ColorOS 6.1 interface. This is a big deviation from standard Android in some ways, and not so much in other ways.
There are standard homescreens, and you can choose whether to use an apps menu or not. Put the app screen back and a flick upwards takes you to it. It’s like “default” Android, before it became completely gesture obsessed and put the multi-tasking screen between your home screens and the app drawer.
However, ColorOS is a bit of a visual downgrade too. You have to use relatively severe square icons, not favoured by any other popular Android UI because they look quite stiff.

The Oppo Reno 2 does have themes that alter icon style, wallpapers and so on, five of them, but none changes the square icons.
ColorOS 6.1 also comes with few unwanted apps, the Opera browser and AquaMail. But most are less objectionable tools like a music player, and a “Clone” app, to let you copy data from your old phone.
There’s also a Smart Assistant home screen. This is a home for widgets, the kind of feature most people don’t need. But it could be useful if, for example, you want a place to see the weather or your daily step count without dumping them on your home screen.
ColorOS is far from my favourite Android UI. However, having used both the Reno 2 and Reno 2 Z recently, I have started to bed into its style, which has also improved significantly over the last couple of years.

Oppo Reno 2 Performance – Impressive power for a mid-range price
The Oppo Reno 2 has a Snapdragon 730G processor. This is a mid-range processor with a specific focus on mobile gaming (hence the “G”), which is handy given gaming is one of the few good reasons to pay more for a high-end CPU.
Snapdragon’s 730G has eight cores. Two are Kryo 470 Gold performance cores, the other six are Kryo 470 Silvers. The gaming side appears, obviously, in the GPU. This is an Adreno 618 just like the standard Snapdragon 730, but it’s overclocked by 15% for better performance.
How does it stack up? In 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme test the Oppo Reno 2 scores 2409 points (2263 using Vulkan). This is not even close to the 5600 points a Snapdragon 855 phone can achieve, but is a lot better than the Google Pixel 3A XL’s Snapdragon 670, which scores 1679 points (OpenGL 3.1).

Real-world results are great too. The Oppo Reno 2 can comfortably play Ark: Survival Evolved maxed-out, a very taxing job. Sure, the frame rate isn’t quite as high as that of a Snapdragon 855 phone and there are a few dips occasionally. But it’s more than playable.
PUBG runs very well with the max available settings too. The Oppo Reno 2 gets you pretty close to the experience of a top-end Snapdragon phone, without actually having top-end hardware. It also has 256GB storage – a lot.
However, if you’re willing to try a brand like Oppo, why not another Chinese one such as Xiaomi? Its Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro has a much more powerful Snapdragon 855, and can be found for £399 at the time of publishing.

Oppo Reno 2 Camera – A few niggling issues, but otherwise a largely great snapper set up
The Oppo Reno 2 has a compelling camera line-up. There’s a very good motorised 16-megapixel front camera and four on the back.
These are a 48-megapixel Sony IMX568, a 13-megapixel 2x zoom, 8-megapixel ultra-wide and a 2MP depth camera. A little button that changes the field of view cycles between the three main focal lenghts, and a 5x hybrid zoom. You can also use digital zoom to get all the way into 20x, but these images look poor.

This is an upgrade over the lower-end Reno 2 Z, as it does not have a true zoom camera. You can zoom in and get more detail, zoom out for a dramatically scene-distorting view.
But the Oppo Reno 2 also highlights the remarkable work Google did with the camera of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3A range, in direct comparison.
A phones with a good-quality zoom, like the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, will produce much better zoomed images than the Pixel. The Oppo Reno’s zoom camera is only OK, though, and its results at 5x zoom only produce, at best, only slightly more detail than the software enhanced Pixel 3A XL. The Oppo images are also noisier and have significantly worse dynamic range in lower light.

Night shots at 1x zoom also have less detail than the Pixels, despite a sensor that, on paper, only has a quarter the resolution (the Pixel 3A has a 12MP sensor).
However, let’s not hit the Oppo Reno 2 too hard. To get close to the Pixel 3, and the Reno does, is a real achievement in itself. The quad camera array means buyers are more likely to use the different focal lengths on offer, and it has one the Pixel does not – the ultra-wide. Here’s an example of the shots you can get from one position:
Ultra-wide
1X view
Zoom
5X zoom
The ultra-wide doesn’t have the raw detail of the main camera, but the 48-megapixel can produce lots of detail in such conditions, even though it actually shoots 12-megapixel images. Like every ultra-high resolution phone camera, it uses pixel binning, where sensor pixels are combined to effectively increase light sensitivity. Unusually, the Reno 2 doesn’t let you take pics at 48-megapixel resolution.
The Oppo Reno 2’s night mode is also good, just not the best around. It brightens images so they are lighter than they appear to the naked eye, and each shot only takes a couple of seconds.
Standard mode
Night mode
As you can see, it’s highly effective. But it isn’t subtle, tending to flatten the dynamics of an image, and does not actually recover as much detail as some. Just look at the back quarter of the church. It’s far brighter in the enhanced photo, but the brickwork texture is still mushy. I’m sure the Reno 2 could do better if there was an option to extend the “exposure” time for night mode, but there isn’t.
I’ve picked a few holes in the Reno 2 camera, but it’s largely great. Dynamic range enhancement is great, it handles night conditions fairly well, and having 5x zoom and an ultra-wide on hand is a huge bonus.
Portrait mode is the one part I think should be better. This lets you take photos with a blurred background. It’s too picky about the distance of your subject, and the results aren’t great anyway.
Even with a depth sensor, portrait modes like this rely on algorithms that separate foreground from background, and Oppo’s seem behind the times.

Here are a few more sample images:
Ultra-wide
Ultra-wide
1X
2X zoom
5X zoom

You can shoot video at up to 4K resolution, 30 frames per second, or 1080p, 60 frames. 4K video is stabilised too, although the Oppo Reno 2 eats into the field of view a lot to do so. As a result, stabilisation effectiveness is very good.

Oppo Reno 2 Battery life – Excellent fast charging and impressive stamina
The Oppo Reno 2 has a 4000mAh battery, just like the Reno 2 Z. Oppo says its VOOC fast charging will get you from zero to 50% in a half-hour. I tried it from flat, the phone off, and it made it to 47% in 30 minutes.
This may be a tiny bit off the claim, but the charging speed is still excellent. Its makes those quick mid-afternoon top-ups a breeze. Just 10 minutes or so gets you a significant boost.
Real-world battery stamina is good, but doesn’t quite match the top Huawei phones with similar capacity. Oppo’s power management doesn’t seem quite as frugal, which makes the phone easier to drain to below 20% by the time you go to bed. This is after a reasonably heavy day of use, though, and you can rely on the phone to last a full day.
An hour of streamed Netflix takes just 6% off the battery, suggesting it will last for 15-16 hours of streaming. No complaints there.
Should I buy the Oppo Reno 2?
The Oppo Reno 2 is a solid mid-range phone that is particularly good for movie streaming thanks to its big notch-free screen. This also makes it a top candidate for games, although the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro offers more power at a similar price.
And the rest? As you might expect, it doesn’t quite match up to phones twice the price, but it performs well enough in all areas to make it a better choice than those models for many.
The camera is versatile, even if its zoom and night modes don’t trouble those of the Pixel 4 XL and Huawei Mate 30 Pro. And it earns extra points for its fast in-screen fingerprint scanner and 3.5mm headphone jack, which smooth-out day-to-day use.
Verdict
A high-quality phone that performs well enough in all areas to offer serious competition to more expensive ones.

What is the Oppo Reno 2Z?
We called the original Reno Z a leading mid-range phone in our review. It wasn’t perfect, but it offered a lot of hardware for a very reasonable spend.
The Oppo Reno 2 Z just adds more, with an extra two rear cameras and motorised front camera that makes a great screen even better. We are still not fans of Oppo’s ColorOS interface, which tries a little too hard to make its mark, but this is a very compelling phone.
It looks and feels much like £500-plus alternatives, battery life is good and the Reno 2 Z is powerful enough at the price.

Oppo Reno 2Z Design – Expensive looking glass and metal for a mid-range price
The Oppo Reno 2Z is one of the most expensive-looking phones you’ll find at the price. There’s no notch, the screen borders are small and its shell is aluminium and Gorilla Glass 5.
It’s thicker than most at 8.7mm, but this lets the rear cameras lie completely flush with the back glass. A tiny metal bump above the cameras stops damage to the camera glass should you accidentally scrape the whole back of the phone against rough surface.
The relative thickness also allows for a 4035mAh battery without the kind of internal engineering that goes into making a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus.
Related: Best phone 2019

This is a substantial phone. It has the presence of a top-end phone, at the price of one made for people not willing to drop everything (mostly cash) to get hold of the latest tech.
There are several thoughtful extras too. The Oppo Reno 2Z has a headphone jack, missing from most expensive mobiles at this point, and an expertly applied screen protector. A faux leather case is included in the box, for full protection.
It has a fast in-screen fingerprint scanner too, another hallmark of a more expensive phone. The Oppo Reno 2Z oozes value in a very deliberate way.

The Google Pixel 3A XL is an obvious alternative, and in some ways it’s better. The processor’s GPU is superior, the camera is more consistent and the software is cleaner. But the Oppo feels and looks much more impressive. Even if you ignore the differences of glass and metal versus plastic, the big display border of the Pixel make it seem stodgy and a little dated next to the Oppo.
There’s one thing missing, though – the Oppo Reno 2Z has no official water resistance.
Oppo Reno 2Z Screen – A notch-free OLED panel to keep gamers happy
The Oppo Reno 2 Z has a 6.52-inch OLED “panoramic” display, the term Oppo uses to describe the notch-free screen.
It’s a 2340 x 1080 pixel panel, and is comfortably one of the best you’ll find in a sub-£400 phone. Big, bold, rich and free of notches and punch holes, it is simply brilliant for gaming and watching video.

You could even argue it is better than the displays of some top-end phones, as there’s no colour shift or brightness drop-off caused by a curved display like the Galaxy S10’s. Most of the fundamentals of image quality are good too. Whites look pure, and you have some control over the temperature, whether the tone skews warm (orangey) or cool (blue).
The Oppo Reno 2Z would benefit from some colour controls, though. Screen colour is very saturated, and the option to tone it down just a little would be welcome. This is in the Oppo Reno 2, but not the Z, suggesting we may see the feature in an update.

However, the calibration itself is sound. I took a photo of a scene that features some bold primary colours, and looked at it both on the Oppo Reno 2 Z’s screen and that of a calibrated MacBook Pro. The difference in saturation was only slight, so your photos won’t suddenly look weak and undersaturated when you upload them to a social network or transfer them elsewhere.
The Oppo Reno 2Z also supports HDR video, but there’s bad news for Netflix subscribers. At launch the phone is not fully certified, meaning it’s limited to 540p resolution.
Oppo Reno 2Z Software – A few customisation tweaks, but ColourOS won’t be for everyone
The Oppo Reno 2Z runs Android 9 and has an interface called ColorOS 6.1. This doesn’t come with as many preinstalled apps as, for example, Samsungs, but Oppo still has a way to go to make ColorOS look as good as Pixel UI, the cleanest Android of them all.
I’m not a fan of some of the choices made. Square icons? Whose idea was that? I spend a good half-hour trying to find where you can alter this, but you can’t. The Oppo Reno 2Z does have a system of themes, which change icons, wallpapers and lock screens, but all five themes have square icons. What do you have to do to get a circle around here (note: yes some of the icons are circular, but the default is square here)?

Those in other countries may have more luck. The Oppo Reno 2Z doesn’t give you access to the Oppo Theme store in the UK, so you’re stuck with the default five.
ColorOS also comes with a few apps you probably don’t want: AquaMail and the Opera browser. But you can get rid of them.
Only the surace layer of the Oppo Reno 2Z’s software is objectionable. Android feels quick, with very little sense of it being slowed by the phone’s mid-tier processor. I came to the phone after using the low-cost Motorola Moto E6 Plus, and this is in a completely different league. This is performance fit for the high-end crowd.

Despite the lack of truly customisable icons, there are some very useful UI tweaks. You can choose whether to have an app drawer or not, and how many rows of icons the Oppo Reno 2Z fits into its homescreens. I recommend setting this to the max unless you have a spot of long-sightedness as, much like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, the big icons it uses fresh out of the box can make it appear toy-like.
Oppo Reno 2Z Performance – Better than you might expect for the price
Day-to-day performance is great, but how about the harder stuff? The Oppo Reno 2Z has the same Mediatek Helio P90 CPU as the original Reno Z.
This is an octa-core processor with an accomplished set of cores for a mid-ranger. There are two Cortex-A75s and six Cortex-A55s, but the performance and “everyday” sets are arranged in sets of four cores, not two and six. There’s 8GB of RAM, more than you’d expect at the price.
The GPU is a PowerVR GM9446, from Britain’s own Imagination Technologies. According to 3D Mark’s Sling Shot Extreme benchmark, it’s only around a fifth as powerful as the Adreno 640 used in the Snapdragon 855. It scores 1193 points.

But how about something closer? The Samsung Galaxy A50 has a Mali-G72 MP3 GPU, which scores around 15-20% less in the same test. This Oppo also beats the Moto G7 Plus’s Adreno 509, but is ultimately no better than is expected at the price. And it is significantly less powerful than the Google Pixel 3A XL’s Adreno 615, which has around 60% more graphics power on tap (it scores 1679 points in Sling Shot Extreme).
The result? Stuttering frame rates in some games. I tried a couple of rounds of PUBG at the highest graphics settings available, “HD” with anti-aliasing switched on. It is very playable, but on a few occasions a less-than-ideal frame rate became obvious. Surprisingly, I found it most noticeable when inside a building, when you’d expect the rate to increase, if anything.
Ark: Survival Evolved does not run well at “Epic” with the resolution slider maxed either. The frame rate stutters. This game also exhibits a lot of visual glitches, suggesting it has not been properly optimised for the MediaTek CPU and its PowerVR GPU. Or that there’s still some work to be done with the Vulkan API, on which the game relies.
Such fine-tuning is all-but guaranteed when you buy a phone with one of the more popular Snapdragon CPUs. MediaTek chipsets continue to be something of a poor relation.
Oppo Reno 2Z Camera – An impressive ultra-wide lens with good, but not class-leading, image quality
The Oppo Reno 2Z has four cameras on the back and one on the front. This is where we see the biggest differences between the original Reno Z and this newer model.
It gains a motorised front unit, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera and a two 2MP portrait cameras. One is a depth sensor, the other a black and white one.

How does it compare to the higher-end Reno 2? The primary 48-megapixel camera has OIS in the Reno 2 but not here, and that phone has a 13-megapixel “zoom” instead of a 2MP mono portrait camera.
The 16-megapixel front camera is similar to the Reno 2’s, but with a different mechanism for the retracting selfie camera.
The Oppo Reno 2Z’a front camera sits in a little rectangle that zips in and out of the top of the phone when you use face unlock or the selfie mode. Its housing also has colour LEDs on its sides that glow as it does so — these have no real function, but they are eye-catching, if a little cheesy.

Skipping to the back, the Oppo Reno 2Z’s cameras offer a very wide range of composition options. You can shoot normal photos, ultra-wides or up to 10x zoom.
The Oppo Reno 2 Z has no optical zoom of its own, unlike the Reno 2, so all the information in zoomed-in photos comes from the 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor. OnePlus used the same sensor in the OnePlus 7 Pro.
Some slightly cynical camera-loading is going on here. Two of the rear sensors are very low-cost components that bump up how good the Oppo Reno 2Z looks on paper without significantly adding to the cost, or its abilities.

Using two portrait cameras on the back is a bizarre choice that only seems to impact a Portrait mode monochrome profile many will never even use. And using a good camera and turning the results black & white is much more effective than using a remedial 2MP B&W sensor for the same job. This is a cheap spec-boosting tactic.
General image quality is good, but the ultra-wide is the only real benefit over the class-leading Google Pixel 3A XL. And the Pixel otherwise beats the Reno in every category.
Its zoom-in images are more detailed, even with a 12MP sensor instead of a 48-megapixel one. Its Night Sight mode is better than the Reno 2Z’s Night mode, which tends to flatten images in the manner of an overactive HDR algorithm. It can result in some multi-exposure frame ghosting too, suggesting Oppo’s image processing isn’t quite good enough to deal with handshake movement (this is occasional, not pervasive).

Auto mode
Night mode
This may sound quite damning, but is only really another indictment of a focus on sensor-loading rather than a laser-like focus on the actual results. The Reno 2Z can still take very good photos, including more-than-fair ones at night.
Let’s not forget the wide-angle camera either. This may not use mind-blowing hardware, but it has smart enough processing to smooth-out images taken in lower light and offers that all-important larger than life field of view.
Ultra-wide

The Oppo Reno 2 Z can shoot video at up to 4K resolution, 30 frames per second. However, the software stabilisation loses much of its effectiveness above 1080p, 30 frames per second. And even at this setting, the stabilisation algorithm can produce some odd shimmering effects when dealing with fast movement. My best guess is that it doesn’t properly account for the lack of optical stabilisation, present in the step-up Reno 2.
Oppo Reno 2Z Battery Life – Impressive fast charge, with good real-world stamina
The Oppo Reno 2 Z has a 4000mAh battery with VOOC charging, Oppo’s own high current (rather than voltage) charging standard.
Oppo’s claim is it fills up 50% of the battery in half an hour. I drained the battery down completely, set a 30-minute timer, plugged it in and see how far it got – 48% was the result. It’s not quite there, but is close enough.
Real-world stamina is good, if not quite at the level I’ve seen from some Huawei phones with similar capacity. You can generally rely on it to last a full day of heavy use, but the power management isn’t clever enough to see you end a day with almost 50% juice, as I found with the Huawei P30 Pro.
I’d class the stamina as good, but somewhat worse than the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, and significantly worse than the top Huaweis.

Should I buy the Oppo Reno 2Z?
Screen quality and design are the Oppo Reno 2 Z’s best bits, and it is a good-value phone all-round.
It has Google Pixel 3A XL-beating style, and some welcome techy extras like a motorised front camera and very fast in-screen fingerprint scanner. For style and the “gadget” factor, the Oppo Reno 2Z is a clear winner.
But for pure base-level substance, it doesn’t quite match the Pixel 3A range. Those phones have better GPUs, for smoother performance in high-end games, and a more consistent camera. However, for many, these benefits may be outweighed by the Oppo Reno 2 Z’s big, colourful screen. This phone is an absolute treat for movie streaming, so let’s hope it gets certified for HD Netflix streaming soon.
Verdict
A top-notch mid-range Android if you value design and screen quality highly.

Verdict































The OnePlus 7T Pro is the latest flagship smartphone following the OnePlus 7 Pro, which was one of Trusted Reviews favourite blowers when it first launched earlier this year.
Unlike the OnePlus 7T, which is a huge update on the older OnePlus 7, the 7T Pro is a very minor spruce up that tweaks the original Pro’s hardware, rather than incrementally changing it.
This makes it a little less exciting than its non-Pro sibling, but with the original Pro’s formula still offering a winning combo, the OnePlus 7T Pro is still a stellar handset and a perfect choice for any Android fan on the market for a top end blower.
The only downside is that, with the 7T featuring most of its core features and costing moderately less, it’s a little harder to justify the extra investment for the Pro OnePlus model this time around.
Read our reviews of the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro
Design and Screen

90Hz display enables smooth scrolling and a pop-up selfie camera
No waterproofing
1440p resolution panel

The OnePlus 7T Pro has an identical design to its predecessor. To the point that I may as well cut and paste the description from our original OnePlus7 Pro review.
For those that missed the original, this means the OnePlus 7 features a similar mixed metal and glass design to pretty much every other flagship phone this year – honestly, take the branding off and I’d wager most people wouldn’t be able to tell the OnePlus 7T Pro and Galaxy S10 Plus apart.
This may sound a little dull, but the design is still great for the most part. The phone has the same pop up front camera, that sees its 16-megapixel front camera rise out of the phone’s top when called upon. This means the phone’s front 6.67-inch, QHD+ resolution screen remains completely notch free, which is a huge boon when watching films or playing games on the phone.
The OnePlus 7T Pro’s entertainment chops are further aided by the Fluid AMOLED’s stellar screen quality, 90Hz refresh rate and the dual Dolby Atmos speakers. The setup’s identical to the regular Pro, which is no bad thing.
The screen is wonderfully well calibrated and features easy to tweak colour settings, so you can tweak it to your liking. The OLED panel is suitably bright to meet mobile HDR standards and all in all, you won’t find a better screen on most smartphones. 
The 90Hz max refresh rate also makes it wonderfully smooth to use and will offer a minor competitive advantage to online mobile gamers. A higher refresh and polling rate reduces the amount of delay between you enacting a command and it playing out on screen.
The speakers sound great and, outside of the Razer Phone 2, are among the loudest I’ve tested on a smartphone.
The only functions I’m not 100% sold on are the 2.5D screen design and in-screen fingerprint scanner. The 2.5D glass wraps around the OnePlus 7T Pro’s sides giving it a seriously luxurious look. The problem is, I find the design makes the phone a little more difficult to hold than its flat screened sibling, the OnePlus 7. In my experience the curve can also make the screen a little more delicate.
The in-screen fingerprint scanner is a great convenience, but I’ve found it can be a little slow to react, taking a fraction of a second longer to read my digit than I’d like.

Camera 

Main 48MP Sony sensor
This is paired with telephoto and ultra wide cameras
Macro is the only real change over the 7 Pro

Flip the OnePlus 7T Pro round and it’s a similarly familiar tale. The phone features an identical triple-sensor rear camera setup to its predecessor. The setup pairs 48-megapixel main, 8-megapixel telephoto and 16-megapixel wide-angle sensors.
The only big difference is that there’s a new and improved macro mode that OnePlus claims will let you capture usable images of things that are a meagre 2.5cm away. The mode’s the same one that debuted one regular OnePlus 7T. It works well and lets you capture macro shots a distances that render many competing phones’ cameras useless, but the overall package still isn’t industry leading in a few areas.
Being clear, the OnePlus 7T Pro’s camera is still great and more than good enough for most phone buyers’ needs – however it’s not the best camera phone around. If all you want to do is snap a few photos of you and your friends and family, or document your holiday, it’ll do the job.
Shots taken in regular light look great. They aren’t overprocessed generally look sharp and have suitably realistic colours. The snappy autofocus also makes it fairly pleasant to shoot on. The backup telephoto and wide angle sensors also give you a decent selection of shot options. These include the ability to quickly choose between two focal lengths when shooting portraits or grab a wider panoramic shot when capturing things like cityscapes and countryside.
But it still fails to match key rivals, such as the Huawei P30 Pro and Pixel 3a XL in low light. The OnePlus 7T Pro is better at taking low light photos than most mid-range phones, but at the top end of the market it’s firmly in the middle of the pack – despite the work OnePlus has done improving it’s Nightscape mode. The Nightscape mode aims to improve the camera’s low light performance using processing magic, and for the most part it’s OK.
Photos in low light are usable and fine for basic things, like sharing on social media, but they don’t look as nice as the ones taken on the P30 Pro or Pixe 3a XL. The iPhone 11 Pro also offers better low light performance, with images generally having better contrast and looking cleaner and brighter than those taken on the OnePlus 7T Pro.

Performance

Snapdragon 855+ chipset remains capable
Either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage
Really nice software experience 

The only actual hardware changes related to the OnePlus 7T Pro’s CPU and battery. Specifically OnePlus has loaded the 7T Pro with Qualcomm’s latest gaming-focussed Snapdragon 855 Plus CPU, boosted the battery capacity to 4085mAh and loaded it with its custom Warp Charge 30T fast charging tech.
Battery life

30w ‘Warp’ Charging gives you 70% charge in 30 minutes
4085mAh battery
No wireless charging

The move to 30T fast charging means the phone can go from 0-70% charge after half an hour at the mains, according to OnePlus. With real use I got similar results to the regular OnePlus 7T. On average the OnePlus 7T Pro will get between 50-60% charge every half hour.
With real world use battery life is solid, but not industry leading. Using it as my main phone I generally got a day to two days use out of the OnePlus 7T Pro. Regular use entailed taking and making a few calls throughout the day, regularly checking my incoming messages and social media feeds, listening to music on my commute, plus an hour or two’s Netflix streaming and PUBG before bed. This is about what we got from the regular OnePlus 7 Pro.
The Fluid AMOLED display puts a bigger strain on the battery than regular phones running demanding tasks like video stream and gaming however.
Streaming video with the screen set to 90Hz and at 150 nits, the brightness most people will find comfortable, the OnePlus 7T Pro lost between 6-8% of its charge per hour on average. Gaming with the same screen settings the discharge rate shot up to around 14-17% per hour. Neither of these scores are bad and put the 7T Pro on a par with most flagships when it comes to battery life.

You should buy it if…
You want great specs and a very fast phone
With its smooth 90Hz screen, nippy charging and the Snapdragon 855+ chipset the OnePlus 7T Pro is a great choice if you’re after a fast phone.
You hate the notch and front camera cutout
By utilising a motorised pop-up front camera, the screen here is completely clear of any distractions.
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You’re after a class-leading camera
The one thing that has consistently held back OnePlus is its camera tech and once again the 7T Pro’s biggest downside is its photography skills.
You already have the OnePlus 7 Pro
This release is a minor upgrade over the OnePlus 7 and is not worth the upgrade if you already have that phone
Verdict
If you’ve already invested in a OnePlus 7 Pro, there’s little reason to upgrade to the OnePlus 7T Pro. The phone is an at best modest refinement on its predecessor. But that doesn’t stop it being a great smartphone that will meet 99% of users needs.

Verdict




 



The Huawei Mate 30 Pro has a fantastic camera, an awesome battery, a powerful processor and an attractive design, but even these features can’t hide the fact that its lack of access to Google apps will make it a very hard sell to customers outside China.



Pros

Excellent Camera
Long-Lasting Battery
Fast Processor



Cons

No access to Google apps
Screen isn't the sharpest around

Though not yet released in Europe, we reviewed a Chinese version of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, and installed Google apps and services on it by way of a now-defunct backdoor solution.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Design
When you spend a small fortune on a mobile phone, you want it to look like it costs exactly that – fortunately, this handset fits the bill. 
My device has a shimmering blue-lilac shade that’s known officially as ‘Cosmic Purple’, and the quad camera module continues the deep space theme with in its circular resemblance to HAL 9000. The back panel’s colour has a metallic sheen, catching the light nicely and drawing attention to the distinctive camera module, while the Gorilla Glass 6 construction makes it smooth to the touch without being slippery.

The purple back barely touches the side of the device before it flows into the waterfall screen, which laps around the side at a dizzying 88-degree angle and ensures a staggering screen to body ratio of 94.1%. Interrupting the top of that screen is a wide notch containing multiple lenses for taking selfies. It’s not too deep, and so is not particularly intrusive into video or gaming content, even though it hasn’t got the same thrill as the pop-up cameras we’ve seen in the OnePlus 7 Pro or Oppo Reno.
There’s only one button on the whole device – the on/off button in a vibrant pink colour, in pleasing contrast to the colour scheme and complementing it well. The volume buttons are here replaced by a touchscreen solution: double tap twice at the side to activate the slider, and simply run your thumb up or down the side of the screen to set the volume. It’s a gimmick for sure, and the two-step process means that by definition it cannot be as immediate or responsive as a physical button.

Continuing with audio hardware, or lack thereof, there’s no 3.5mm headphone jack on this phone, which is no longer a surprise, as the trend has spread like a virus to all of the biggest flagship handsets. However, it’s a particular irritation here for several reasons – there is no 3.5mm to USB-C dongle included the box, the supplied in-ear headphones are poor, and most frustratingly of all, the Bluetooth connection was often unreliable when pairing with my wireless headphones.
The design looks great and feels comfortable in the hand, but it’s not the most practical.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Camera
The camera is highly impressive, offering a great amount of versatility, smart application of artificial intelligence and great detail.
Getting straight to the specifications, the Huawei Mate 30 Pro’s cameras consist of a 40-megapixel main wide angle camera, an 8-meapixel telephoto sensor, and a 40-megapixel ultrawide lens. There’s also a 3D Time-of-Flight sensor thrown into the mix to complete the quadfecta. The below images were all taken from the same position.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro: ultrawide
Huawei Mate 30 Pro: wide angle
Huawei Mate 30 Pro: telephoto
 Once you’ve taken just a handful of snaps you’ll quickly realise the high quality of the photography – there’s a reason that its predecessor, the Huawei P30 Pro, still holds the title of our highest-rated camera phone. Friends, whether familiar or unfamiliar with mobile photography, were all quick to praise the evident quality of the pictures across the range of lenses.
The Huawei Mate 30 Pro can capture high levels of detail
Detail is incredible, capturing levels even beyond what your eyes can see. Bricks in distant buildings are clearly distinct, as are the expressions on small statues. Colours are rich and enhanced without seeming forced or unreal. 
Huawei Mate 30 Pro: Food Close-Up
However, there is some distortion in the ultrawide lens that mean it’s best kept for landscape shots or cityscapes; a snap of a group of friends left the two on the periphery putting The Rock to shame with the size of their bulging biceps. 
The telephoto sensor offers a handy zoom feature without compromising on quality, perfect for capturing finer detail on buildings for instance. 

Portrait Mode off (left) and on (right)
The artificial intelligence is quick to recognise scenarios and spring into action to create portraits, emphasise the blue sky, and bring out the colours of flowers and food. However, if it’s not right for the mood you want, you can simply dismiss it. It’s not quite as handy as the Pixel 3, which gives you the option of keeping either the processed or unprocessed shot.

Night Mode off (left) and on (right)
The real test of software quality often comes with the low-light settings, and this was a key upgrade for the Huawei Mate 30 Pro. Night Mode requires a wait of around 7 seconds to perfect the shot, and under very dark conditions it expertly restores missing detail. Even without this mode enacted, it still creates great night-time images, and the standard mode will obviously be preferable when snapping a moving subject.
Videos are impressive as well, with very good stabilisation and a smooth zoom. A particular selling point is the slow-motion mode, which is a fun effect for a short video at 32x – but it’s even capable of going up to an astonishing 256x super slow-motion. While that’s impressive in itself, the detail is very grainy at this level, and the lighting is very inconsistent.

The camera interface is generally user friendly, but it stumbles when it’s time to view the pictures. Using the different cameras is very straightforward and accessible, simply by touching the camera dots or sliding between each to find exactly the right zoom. However, there are two niggling drawbacks to using the camera that I’ve found. Firstly, images often take a couple of seconds of processing to be ready to view (with excellent results, it has to be said), and more irritatingly it often fails to recognise the screen being titled into the horizontal aspect and flipping the picture accordingly. It’s bizarre that this is an issue when even most budget phones can get it right.
Overall, it’s an excellent and versatile camera that creates top-quality images that are among the best from any smartphone.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Display
The 6.53-inch OLED screen on the Mate 30 Pro is immediately distinctive for its waterfall design, with the sides tumbling over the edges at an angle of 88-degrees, to create an immersive finish.
Some devices with this design have run into trouble with registering accidental touches on the side, but this never occurred with the Mate 30 Pro – and as mentioned previously, the new touchscreen volume control has given the curved screen a tangible purpose. 

With a resolution of 1176 x 2400 (409ppi) it’s not the very sharpest screen on the market – it’s actually a surprisingly significant downgrade from the preceding Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which has a resolution of 1440 x 3120, or 538ppi. With that disappointing backwards step in mind, it’s still enjoyable to watch videos on, and the curvature actually makes full-text articles pleasingly immersive as well.
While it’s not the sharpest screen around, it’s certainly very good, and pulls off its daringly different design.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Battery
The battery has an impressive 4500mAh capacity, and it is one of this phone’s strongest attributes. 
The device should last you through a couple of days of moderate use, or you could use it heavily from dawn till dusk and the battery still won’t run dry by the end of the day. It’s almost a challenge to run it down, as even an hour of watching videos will hardly dent its impressive lifespan. 
Having previously used a phone with a stingy battery capacity, the Mate 30 Pro took a weight off my mind, as I knew it could take me through the day with no problem – and even through the next one if I’d forgotten to charge it. 
Along with its Qi wireless charging ability, this handset is also capable of reverse wireless charging. Having put this to the test with the iPhone 8, this feature is not yet developed enough to be a viable option – it drains the device’s battery quickly whilst transferring little power to the charging handset. 
That said, thee Mate 30 Pro’s battery life is reliably steadfast, and along with the camera remains one of the phone’s leading features.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Performance
The Huawei Mate 30 Pro runs on the Kirin 990 chip and it performs very smoothly, as you would expect of a phone of this calibre. 
Everyday performance is excellent (although as mentioned, the post-processing of photos can take a few seconds), and it can deal comfortably with the most demanding mobile games without stuttering or straining.
As you an see from the below scores, it compares very favourably to its competitors at the top of the market, such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus and the iPhone 11 Pro.

There’s no doubt that this device packs a considerable punch, taking its place among the very first rank of smartphones with its processing power.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Software 
We often find Huawei’s EMUI software to be a flaw in otherwise impressive devices, and in truth not much has changed on that front. 
This device shipped without any Google apps, due to the ongoing Android ban, but it still runs on an open-source version of Android 10. We were able to install our favourite Google apps from the Play Store via a backdoor (which has since been slammed shut due to privacy concerns), so our experience of the phone’s software is hardly representative of that of the general user.
The user interface is still more reminiscent of Apple’s iOS than standard Android. As mentioned, our review device is a Chinese handset and so will probably match up with exactly the same pre-installed software as a European release. Upon first start-up, we were greeted by approximately 35 stock apps, few of which were actually useful. The computing power can of course deal with this bloatware easily, but it’s still a minor annoyance.
The software – or rather, the lack of Google’s software – is ultimately the key reason it is impossible for us to recommend this phone despite its otherwise strong performance.
Huawei Mate 30 Pro – Verdict 
The Huawei Mate 30 Pro is a high-performing flagship handset that has a breath-taking camera and an enduring battery. Minor flaws in the interface and screen quality are not deal-breakers of themselves, but the lack of Google apps on this phone (currently with no authorised workaround) make it impossible to recommend this phone.

Verdict
































While the iPhone 11 Pro looks nearly identical to its predecessor, the changes Apple has made do make it a much better phone. The three cameras on the back are truly excellent and might just be my favourite trio of sensors on any phone. The video recording, audio and super-bright XDR display are all tremendous too. This is also the first 5.8-inch iPhone that doesn’t feel hamstrung by a battery that needs constant attention to get it through a full day. All that being said, there are still areas I would have liked to see Apple push forward in, especially as it has now decided to call these phones ‘Pro’. 5G was never going to happen, but would have been nice anyway; some sort of TouchID-enabled fingerprint sensor inside the display and the rumoured reverse wireless charging that could have juiced up a pair of AirPods would all have been welcome features.

Who is the iPhone 11 Pro for?
If you want the fully-loaded 2019 flagship iPhone 11 then the iPhone 11 Pro is the one for you. While I wouldn’t necessarily say this is the best iPhone for everyone, it’s a fantastic buy that stands as one of the most complete iPhones Apple has ever made.
After using the iPhone 11 Pro on a daily basis since its release, my original opinion hasn’t changed and in many ways I like the phone even more. iOS 13 has picked up lots of updates to squash that huge amount of bugs that were there at release and the excellent battery life has become even more obvious. You don’t need to buy the larger phone to achieve a comfortable all-day battery life.
But it’s still the triple camera array on the back that makes this such a great phone and this has become even more obvious after the launch of the Pixel 4. While Google’s new flagship takes excellent snaps, the versatility afforded by the three iPhone sensors just gives you so much more freedom. The video recording remains the best on the market too and the facial unlocking is, again, far superior to anything else you can currently get.

Camera

Is this the iPhone camera to topple the competition?

The iPhone 11 Pro packs three distinct 12-megapixel cameras, which for the first time in an Apple device, includes an ultra-wide angle lens (13mm equivalent, f/2.4). You also get a standard lens (26mm, f/1.8) and a 2x telephoto lens (52mm, with an improved maximum aperture of f/2.0).

These are the best camera phones

Apple has seriously improved its photographic output with the iPhone 11 Pro (and with the iPhone 11 in many ways) and it now stands toe-to-toe with the best out there. I would even go as far as saying it’s my favourite smartphone camera thanks to the quality of all three cameras, the reliable – if not manually accessible – Night Mode and the sheer sharpness of daylight photos.
Even though the megapixel count hasn’t changed in years, the 11 Pro takes supremely detailed snaps with lovely colour reproduction across all three cameras. You zoom in and zoom out without noticing you’re changing lenses – something that normally trips up other triple-camera phones.
Night Mode is a feature we’ve been wanting on iPhone for a number of years now, and finally we have it. The iPhone 11 Pro’s take on this mode is a little different, as it comes on automatically when the light is low and can’t be manually flipped on and off. This can be slightly annoying, as in a few instances I would have preferred to be able to turn it on myself.
The mode works by shooting a number of short exposures then combining them together to produce a finished image which gives the impression of a long exposure. The iPhone 11 Pro will decide for itself how many seconds to shoot for, but you can use a slider to take control of it, while attaching the phone to a tripod will see the mode jump to the maximum number of seconds.

Ultra Wide (left) vs Wide (right)
It’s hard to give a definitive verdict on which phone out of the iPhone 11 Pro, Google Pixel 3 and Huawei P30 Pro take the best night shots, as they can vary a lot depending on conditions. The iPhone images have a tendency to sometimes look a little over-sharpened if you zoom in, but the bright and vivid colours make up for this.
Video recording is excellent too, easily the best on any phone you can buy now. We’ve got a load more video samples and thoughts on our iPhone 11 Pro camera page so head there for all the details about this fantastic camera.

Performance and iOS 13

The fastest small phone around

The iPhone 11 Pro is an absolute performance beast, with the new A13 Bionic chipset helping put it up there with the fastest phones we have reviewed. That should come as no surprise to anyone who is familiar with Apple’s silicone, as it has constantly been ahead of the competition from Qualcomm, Samsung and Huawei.
Paired with the A13 is a completely new U1 chip. This is able to directly communicate with other iPhones packing the U1 to transfer files through AirDrop, without the need for a connection. There’s also, according to the Geekbench benchmarking app, 4GB inside. Apple never details its RAM specs and the amount has rarely affected how well an iPhone performs.
Simply claiming the iPhone 11 Pro feels ‘fast’ feels like its underplaying this chip. Yes, scrolling around is fast and smooth while apps open instantaneously. You can play all the new games in Apple’s £4.99 Arcade subscription service without ever so much as a dropped frame or judder. But, then again, that’s very much the case with iPhones going back a few years. If you’re moving from an iPhone X, an iPhone XS or even an iPhone 8 I doubt you’ll notice an immediate speed difference.
Related: Apple Arcade games
But this chipset isn’t just about pure speed. The A13 Bionic enables a load of the tricks that really set the 11 Pro apart: 4K 60fps video recording from all the cameras, for instance, and the much improved Smart HDR that churns out such exceptional pictures. The A13 accounts for the snappier FaceID sensor that unlocks the phone too, and you can definitely see the phone recognising your face quicker than before.
FaceID still sits inside the notch
I’m happy with Apple sticking with FaceID as I firmly believe it’s the most reliable unlocking solution out there. However, the idea of TouchID returning with an Apple-developed in-display fingerprint is certainly exciting for those times – like in the middle of the night – where FaceID feels inadequate. Again, adding something like this might have done more to back-up the ‘Pro’ tag.
Another missing feature that might be a big omission (for some, anyway) is 5G. Samsung, LG, Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi all have 5G-enabled phones available to buy, and Three, EE and Vodafone (with o2 arriving soon) have 5G networks turned on in the UK. Of course, 5G is still in its infancy and its not like Apple to jump on a bandwagon before its fully realised, so it’s hardly surprising 5G is lacking.
Related: 5G in the UK
The updated A13 chipset should also ensure the iPhone 11 Pro stays fast over the next couple of years, something I can’t comfortably say about even high-end Android devices. Pick up the two-year-old iPhone 8 and it still performs admirably and has access to the latest software – the same should be true of the 11 Pro in two years. This is of course very important these days as phones get more and more expensive and consumers generally upgrade less.
Like the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro has improved audio. The ‘Spatial’ audio supports formats Dolby 5.1 (if you’re watching from Netflix) and Atmos (iTunes) with the purpose being to make noise seem like it’s coming from around the whole device, rather than just the speakers at either end. Audio quality is actually fantastic from both the 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max and the effect (that’s all it really is) seems to work as well as expected.
One big issue I have with these new Pro phones are the meagre amounts of base storage. If you’re touting your new flagship as a professional device then it needs to come with more than 64GB of storage. I would recommend to anyone spending upwards of £/$1000 on this phone to skip that option completely and jump straight to the 256GB size. It would be easy to fill up 64GB with a bit of 4K60fps shooting (this uses up roughly 400/450MB per minute), a number of Apple Arcade games (about 1GB each) and a load of photos. 64GB is hardly ‘Pro’.
iOS 13 isn’t a huge overhaul of the iOS formula, however it does add a few new features that improve the experience. Dark Mode turns all the system apps an easier to read shade of black, and you can now swipe around the keyboard instead of tapping. Photos and Maps have both received healthy updates that seriously improve their functionality. 
Screen

The iPhone 11 screen ticks all the boxes, apart from one

It might have a fancy new name and plenty of hype, but the 5.8-inch OLED display used on the iPhone 11 Pro is very much the same as the panel on the iPhone XS. It’s a fantastic, sharp and colourful display and easily one of the nicest to look at out of any 2019 phone.
The new ‘Super Retina XDR’ branding seems to point solely towards the increase in brightness, with the iPhone 11 Pro now capable, Apple says, of consistently hitting 800 nits when the phone is being used in direct sunlight. It should also be able to boost that further to 1200 nits when you’re playing back HDR-enabled content from iTunes or Netflix. 
Testing either of these is difficult as there’s no manual way to constantly enable these super-bright modes, however putting the 11 Pro next to the XS and streaming John Wick 3 in Dolby Vision HDR does show the newer model is seriously better at producing HDR images. I would rarely choose to watch a film on such a small screen but the reproduction here is fantastic.
You’ll notice that extra brightness when you’re using the phone outside, too. It’s one of the best phones I have reviewed for combating glare on sunny days.
iPhone 11 Pro (left) 5.8-inches vs iPhone 11 Pro Max (right) 6.5-inches
One notable missing feature, that might really have truly earned that ‘Pro’ tag, is a faster refresh display. The ProMotion displays on the iPad Pro up the standard 60Hz to a maximum 120Hz, giving everything a much smoother look. It’s hard to explain just how much better a 90Hz or 120Hz screen is, but once you’ve seen it, it can be hard to go back. OnePlus introduced a 90Hz OLED with the OnePlus 7 Pro and it remains the finest screen on any smartphone.
Design

More of the same

iPhone 11 Pro retains many of the design characteristics of the iPhone XS, and the iPhone X before it. Apple seems to have settled into a three-year update cycle for big design refreshes and that leaves the iPhone 11 Pro feeling very familiar – and a little stale.
It’s a good looking phone, don’t get me wrong, but we’ve seen it all before. The iPhone X was a huge shift in terms of looks for Apple phones and it felt fresh, now when you compare the 11 Pro to something like the OnePlus 7T Pro or Samsung Galaxy Note 10, and it doesn’t feel so fresh.
A lot of this comes from the notched display, which is a trait most Android phones have managed to shrink or get rid of entirely. The notch here remains the same size as it was two years ago and it does get in the way on this relatively small 5.8-inch screen.
If the front looks the same, the back has some differences. The Apple logo sits lower and there’s no branding elsewhere, which makes for a super-clean looking device. There’s also a lovely new matte finish on the back that rejects fingerprints and oily residue. This new finish is a little more slippery than the glossy, though, and that might mean you’ll perhaps need to add a case quicker than you originally wanted.
Of course, the elephant in the room with this year’s iPhone 11 Pro design is the rather ‘out there’ camera module. The three new sensors sit inside a glossy square, paired with a flash and microphone. In pictures, I admit, these look pretty ugly – big, bulbous and distracting. However, in reality I quite like it. The entire back is milled from a single piece of glass and the actual camera sensors don’t stick too far out. It’ll still wobble if you try and type with it on a table, though.
If you really hate the look then I would suggest plumping for the Space Grey or Midnight Green colours as the overall dark hue does a good job at covering up the cameras. With the Gold and Silver options, the contrasting black cameras stand out a lot more.
If you’re stuck between the 11 Pro and the 11 Pro Max, then size is one of the big differences. The 11 Pro is among the smaller flagship phones around and can just about be used comfortably with one hand. The regular 11 Pro is also much lighter and slightly thinner than the Max.
The camera array is certainly eye-catching
Apple says the glass used on these phones is the ‘toughest glass ever on a smartphone’ thanks to a ‘dual-ion exchange’. That may very well be true, but I am not going to purposely drop a £1000 smartphone onto concrete to test out those claims. What I have noticed is that the screen remains very easy to scratch – I had an obvious ding after only a few days of general use.
While the iPhone 11 Pro remains IP68 rated for water resistance, Apple now says the phone can be submerged in 4m of water for 30 minutes – up from 1m.
Battery Life

Go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want truly excellent endurance

The iPhone 11 Pro is the first time a 5.8-inch device from Apple hasn’t felt hamstrung by its battery life. With both the iPhone X and iPhone XS I felt the need to babysit the phones through the day (and maybe give them a top-up if I was going to have a long night), but with the iPhone 11 Pro that’s not the case.
Apple claims there has been a four hour improvement (that’s five hours with the Pro Max) when you compare the XS to the 11 Pro. That’s a hard metric to really replicate in real-world usage and, of course, battery varies wildly depending on how you use your phone. I would class my use as heavy, with plenty of picture-snapping and video recording throughout the day, and I still made it through the day without worrying. You can kill it quicker with heavy gaming or HDR video streaming, of course, so do always keep that in mind.
Apple has made the iPhone 11 Pro thicker and heavier to accommodate the larger battery and this is a great call. These phones don’t need to be thinner.
If you’re really wanting the best battery life possible then go for the Max. The iPhone 11 Pro Max is the best iPhone I have ever reviewed when it comes to endurance, easily making it through a day and a half with very heavy use.
Another big improvement to the battery here is a new 18w fast charger that comes bundled with the phone. While this isn’t anything new if you’re an Android die-hard, it’s a big boost for the iPhone, which has been saddled with a measly 5w charger since its first iteration. A full charge of the phone takes roughly (this seems to vary quite a lot) 95 minutes, however you’ll get about 40% in 30 minutes if you want a quick top up. Wireless Qi charging remains at the same 7.5w speeds as before.
Apple’s resistance to fully embracing USB-C is another big irritant I have with this phone. The idea of being able to charge the MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and iPhone 11 Pro with the same block and charger just makes so much sense. At least it now comes with a USB-C to Lightning cable.

Should I buy the iPhone 11 Pro?
While the iPhone 11 Pro looks nearly identical to its predecessor, the changes Apple has made do make it a much better phone.
The three cameras on the back are truly excellent and might just about be my favourite trio of sensors on any phone. The video recording, audio and super-bright XDR display are all tremendous too. This is also the first 5.8-inch iPhone that doesn’t feel hamstrung by a battery that needs constant attention to get it through a full day.
All that being said there are still areas I would have liked to see Apple push forward in, especially as it has now decided to call these phones ‘Pro’. 5G was never going to happen, but would have been nice anyway; some sort of TouchID-enabled fingerprint sensor inside the display and the rumoured reverse wireless charging that could have juiced up a pair of AirPods would all have been welcome features.

And then we come to the design. While it’s still a looker, the iPhone 11 Pro lacks the futuristic all-screen looks of the OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The notch hasn’t been changed and it’s becoming more of a distraction as other phones find nifty ways to shrink it.

But the biggest knock against the iPhone 11 Pro is the iPhone 11. Apple’s other new iPhone has the same main camera, the same ultra wide camera and the same A13 Bionic chipset inside. It’s also around £300/$300 cheaper and available in a much wider array of colours. The iPhone 11 Pro becomes a hard-sell when you consider just how good the iPhone 11 is.

Verdict





























 



A great, everyday phone, the Moto G6 Play is still one of the cheapest handsets that you can buy. The main issue is that the competition has got a lot tougher and you can spend just a little more to get a considerably more powerful handset from the competition. If you're on the tightest of budgets, then this is a handset that you'll be happy with but if you can just spend a little more cash, you'll be happier in the long run.



Pros

Great price
Smart looks
Excellent value
Strong battery life



Cons

Camera could be faster

What is the Moto G6 Play?
One of the best ranges of budget phones, the Moto line-up has been impressing for years. Now, with the Moto G7 Play available, the question is, is the Moto G6 Play still worth buying? Certainly, the new, lower price will make the phone seem enticing, but the bigger issue is that budget phones, by their nature, don’t age as well.
Never has this been so true, as this year, when we’ve seen a huge number of high-quality low-priced handsets that have even managed to eclipse the Moto G7 lineup. Take the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7, for example, with its 48-megapixel camera, or the excellent Honor 10 Lite; sure, both are more expensive than the Moto G6 Play, but for a bit extra cash you get far more features.

Moto G6 Play Design – Consistently attractive
Motorola has established a consistently attractive design language across this latest Moto G family. The Moto G6 Play, G6 and G6 Plus all tote longer, more slender dimensions than their predecessors, primarily dictated by their 18:9 aspect ratio displays, not to mention their curved reflective rears.
They might not seem as sturdy as the Moto G5S line’s construction but they’re markedly more on-trend with the current flagship contingent. Take a look at the Samsung Galaxy S9 or the Huawei P20 Pro and you’ll have some idea of what these Motos are bringing to the table: glass is definitely “in”.
Be that as it may, the Moto G6 Play is the only member of the family that doesn’t use the real thing. Despite its resemblance to its siblings, the phone is instead backed by plastic. In one sense this is a loss; from the perspective of both premium feel and scratch susceptibility. But on the other hand, the material choice renders the Play the most drop-resistant of the three. The plastic doesn’t flex under your fingers either.

Cosmetically, you get a light-reactive finish. Most of the time, the phone appears to have a standard reflective back with a dark blue finish, however, when you catch the light just right you’ll spot a bright blue S-shaped reflection carving its way across the G6 Play’s rear.
It adds a hint of pizzazz without getting close to garish. The phone’s sides are coated aluminium and the front is toughened glass (but not Gorilla Glass as its similarly-named siblings sport).
The other major external difference between the Moto G6 Play and the G6 is the fingerprint scanner. It sits on the back, instead of the front.
Related: Best SIM Only Deals
I’m a fan of rear fingerprint scanners. It’s indented and easy to reach, too. However, it isn’t quite as fast as the best, plus I’ve found it more picky about finger position than some – particularly after washing your hands.
The Moto G6 Play’s scanner may be the first used by some buyers, if they’ve been buying budget phones for years. And in this instance, it’s still fairly reliable and faster than using a passcode.
Other basics that can be ticked off include a headphone jack (often omitted these days) and 32GB of storage. This is plenty for a phone costing £170, but if your storage requirements exceed this then there’s a microSD slot in the SIM card tray as well.

Water-resistance is lacking. The standard G6 and G6 Plus have a water-repelling nano-coating, which at least makes them splash-proof. While the G6 Play is likely to survive being caught in a rain shower, the same can’t be said of a dunk in the bath.
The Moto G6 Play also has a micro-USB charge port rather than the now more popular USB-C type. Plus, this device also offers fast-charging, a fantastic extra at the price.
Moto G6 Play Screen – Comparatively low resolution but great quality
The Motorola Moto G6 Play has a 5.7-inch 18:9 IPS LCD screen, but its resolution is only 1440 x 720 pixels.
This is the 18:9 equivalent of 720p, and Moto G phones have used 1080p panels since the Moto G4 in 2016. The important question: will you notice?
On first turning on the Motorola Moto G6 Play, the difference in pixel density is clear. Look a little closer than normal and pixellation is evident. However, within a few hours of use, I stopped noticing.

Nevertheless, there’s no denying the Moto G6’s display is closer in quality to that of a high-end phone.
The Motorola Moto G6 Play’s colour and contrast are both strong for a budget device, and you can switch between vivid and natural saturation modes, plus a few colour temperature presets. Comparing directly to the Moto G6, the more expensive phone seems to have a slight edge for bringing out the deepest reds in Vivid mode, but there isn’t much in it.
The Moto G6 Play’s screen visibility outdoors on a bright day is perfectly solid too.

Verdict





























 



Following on from the S8, the Samsung Galaxy S9 seemed to be a case of Samsung playing it safe, with not enough changes for our liking to make this a truly stand-out phone. With the launch of the Galaxy S10, the S9 has to be re-evaluated, particularly as its price has dropped. Now, with many similar features to the S10, including the high-quality OLED display and fantastic camera, the S9 is now a great alternative choice for people that want flagship specs but at a lower price, making it arguably a better choice today than it was at launch.



Pros

Fantastic display
Feels great
Much improved speakers



Cons

Average battery life
Dual-sensor only on Plus model
Some lag with Samsung’s software

What is the Samsung Galaxy S9?
When the Samsung Galaxy S9 was first released, I didn’t think that it made much progress over the Galaxy S8, but today we have to look at it in a different light. While the Samsung Galaxy S10 is clearly the better handset, with Samsung making big strides forward and adding new features, price has to be taken into account, with the S9 a far cheaper handset. There’s also the rumoured upcoming Samsung Galaxy S20 and Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra – both of which look set to be announced on February 11.

Samsung Galaxy S9 – Design
With the 2017 Galaxy S8, Samsung introduced a shift in phone design that followed through market-wide. A big bezel was out, to be replaced by a larger screen that pushed right to the edges. It was a much-needed change in a market where phones had started to feel stale.
Related: Samsung Galaxy Watch Active review
The Galaxy S9 retains this familiar overall look, which is hardly something to complain about when you consider that, a couple of years on, the S8 is still one of slickest phones around.
It might look like the S8, but there’s no arguing that the S9 is one good-looking phone
The S9 sees the bezel thickness above and below the display reduce further. In addition, the fingerprint scanner has been moved to a more suitable location beneath the camera, rather than being tucked tightly beside it. However, it still feels a tad on the small side, and there’s noticeable lag as it jumps you to the homescreen.
The metal and glass body retains its curved display, IP68 water-resistance rating and microSD card slot. The aluminium rim has been strengthened and the Gorilla Glass 5 coating the screen has been thickened. As someone who smashed a Galaxy S8 after knocking it off a bed onto a carpeted floor, this is a welcome upgrade.
Related: Best smartphones
You’ll find a dedicated Bixby button below the volume rocker, with the lock-switch on the other side. I dislike the fact that the extra button can only be used with a virtual assistant – I turned it off completely after a day of use – but Bixby remains a huge push for Samsung and, hopefully, it might get a bit better when version 2.0 hits later in the year.
The extra button below the volume rocker can be used for a voice assistant
Having used both the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus, I much prefer the smaller model over its larger brother. I think the 5.8-inch display is big enough, while the phone itself is perfectly sized to use in one hand. There are lots of Android phones that are bigger than this, but the S9 sets itself apart by fitting all the high-end specs into something a little smaller.

Samsung Galaxy S9 – Screen
Like all of Samsung’s recent flagships, the S9’s display draws you in instantly with its rich colours and fantastic contrast. It’s still a slightly curved 5.8-inch AMOLED quad-HD+ panel, and even though little has changed aside from a slight bump in brightness, it’s one of the best displays I’ve seen.
What impresses most about the screen is the customisation options on offer. In its default ‘Adaptive’ mode colours are saturated and rich, with a dominant blue hue – personally, I find this slightly too much. Switch to DCI-P3 colour gamut covering ‘AMOLED cinema’ mode and everything feels easier on the eyes. It’s even possible to customise the colours, reducing the amount of blue, green and red.
Related: What is HDR?
The AMOLED screen is as good as we’ve come to expect from Samsung
Related: OnePlus 6T Review
There’s full support for mobile HDR10 and the S9 can stream HDR content from sources such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. This provides movies and TV shows with better contrast and enables them to use a wider gamut of colours. Watch a programme that features numerous dark scenes, such as Altered Carbon, and you’ll notice the difference right away. This is far from the first phone to boast HDR support, but I haven’t yet seen a phone display it as well.
A blue light filter mode makes this super-bright screen much better for viewing before you sleep by turning everything orange. This can be scheduled to automatically turn on each night.
Viewing angles are good, as is outdoor visibility, but you’ll notice a slight blue shift along the curved edges of the display. This is one of the downsides of OLED; you’ll see it on most phones using the tech. Samsung’s displays do deal with the issue far better than those produced by LG – and used on the Google Pixel 2 – and you’ll really only notice the blue if you go looking for it.

Verdict





























 



The Galaxy Note 10 Plus is the true successor to the Note 9. It’s a brute of a phone with a lovely display, plenty of grunt and a huge battery. There isn’t a whole lot new when compared to the S10 – but this still stands as the true high-end Samsung phone for the end of 2019.

It also remains between this and the OnePlus 7 Pro for best big phone around. The Note 10 Plus has more features than the OnePlus – Qi charging, water-resistance, included USB-C buds – but I do love the 90Hz screen on the 7 Pro. Plus it’s notably cheaper than Samsung’s efforts.



Pros

Lovely big screen
Very quick to charge
S Pen is useful
Versatile cameras



Cons

Camera isn’t quite up there with the best
Dodgy Live Video bokeh mode
65w charger not included

Samsung broke the mould with this year’s Note launch, unveiling two devices where before it’s only ever released one. The Note 10 is the smaller, more affordable option, while the Galaxy Note 10 Plus is the company’s true flagship phablet for 2019. 
As its name suggests, similarly to the S10 series from earlier in the year, the Plus is a larger, more feature-packed take on the standard Note 10, complete with optional 5G. It will continue to be one of Samsung’s flagship devices even after the rumoured launch of the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. 
This is a great phone and one of the finest all-round Android devices I have reviewed this year. It’s powerful, has just about every feature going and doesn’t skimp at all. It’s big – though you should already know this if you’re even considering a Note – and expensive, but if you want the best of the best there isn’t much better out there.

For hands-on impressions of Samsung’s latest, delve into our Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review

How much does the Galaxy Note 10 Plus cost?
The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus is available to buy right now. In the UK (among other markets) you have the option of a 256GB model that sells for £999 ($1099.99 in the US), while the 512GB model unveiled at the phone’s launch isn’t yet confirmed for British shores but is up for grabs for $1199.99 Stateside.
There’s also the matter of the 5G model, which is currently a $1299 Verizon exclusive in the US. In the UK it starts at £1099 (for the 256GB model) and costs £1199 for the higher capacity 512GB SKU.

Camera – The same array as the Galaxy S10 5G with four sensors on the back
Whereas the Note series might have once given us a glimpse of what was to come in the next big Galaxy S phone, now it’s more of a case of using what’s already there. The camera array on the back of the Note 10 Plus has been plucked straight from the Galaxy S10 and while it remains an excellent camera, it’s not quite on the same level as the iPhone 11 Pro or Huawei P30 Pro. 
On the back of the Note 10 Plus there are three cameras, plus a ToF (time of flight) sensor: a main 12-megapixel sensor with an aperture that’ll shift between f/1.5 and f/2.4 depending on the conditions, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide f/2.2 and a 12-megapixel f/2.1 telephoto. 
That ToF sensor is used to more accurately measure depth and Samsung seems to use it pretty much exclusively in the new AR stickers mode. This fun, if slightly gimmicky, addition lets you draw over the top of people’s faces with the S Pen and have those doodles stay attached even when the people moves around.
Related: What is a ToF camera?
Both the main and telephoto cameras have optical image stabilisation (OIS) – just like they did on the S10 series. There’s also a bigger focus on video here with ‘pro-grade’ video recording (Samsung’s words), ‘super-steady’ stabilisation and an improved video editor. It’s true that the video recording is very good here even if it can’t quite match the quality of the iPhone 11 Pro. One thing that does disappoint is the Live Focus bokeh mode for video. This does a really shoddy job at cutting out around your head, leaving a poor result.
Photos from all three of the rear cameras here are really good and have a very distinctive Samsung look. Colours, especially reds and greens, are super bright and vivid, popping right off the OLED display. Detail is strong too, though if you start to zoom in you can notice some slight overuse of post-processing sharpening giving photos a bit of an unnatural look.
Check out the images below for a closer look at how the zoom, wide and ultra wide cameras compare.
The Night Mode does a good job of boosting colours and light in low light. However there’s plenty of noise and some of the bright areas look a little too bright
A low light shot without the night mode enabled
And the same with the night mode on. It’s certainly brighter
Main camera: Colours and detail are both excellent
And the ultra wide gets you so much in the photo
Detail in the shots is reliably excellent
You can get really close to the subject and retain lots of detail
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus Design – A very big phone with a futuristic design
While Samsung’s Galaxy S series offers mass appeal, the Note line has always catered to a more niche audience. As a result, it allows Samsung to take more risks, most evident by its sheer size. 
This phone may be nearing ‘bezel-free’ status, with a screen reaching to the fringes of its borders, but it’s still one of the most sizeable phones I’ve handled – only really comparable to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and OnePlus 7 Pro.
At least it feels fairly light for its size, coming in at 196g as opposed to the 226g iPhone 11 Pro Max.
Related: Best phones 

A glass front and back with heavily curved edges meet at a narrow metal frame – the aesthetic is a blend of strength and elegance, helped by keeping the phone well-polished. I’ve been using the flagship – and heavily advertised – Aura Glow model, and it’s quite the looker. The shimmering bluey/silver colour looks different depending on how the light hits it and reminds me a lot of the Huawei P30 Pro. As nice as it does look though, the back remains an absolute fingerprint magnet. 
The base of the Note 10 Plus features a USB-C port and room for the S Pen stylus to slot in, however, there’s something missing here.
Samsung has finally ditched the headphone jack from the Note’s design, meaning you’ll have to rely on wireless headphones or a pair with a USB-C connection. There’s a perfectly decent sounding pair of AKG branded USB-C headphones in the box, although there’s no 3.5mm dongle.
Unlike the smaller Note 10, the Note 10 Plus retains a microSD slot for upping the base storage. It’s IP68 rated for water resistance too.
Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus Screen – Samsung continues its impressive run of displays 
The 6.8-inch display covers the majority of the front of the Note 10 Plus, curving steeply at the sides to give it that all-screen feel. Normally I am against curved displays – it’s the big mark against the OnePlus 7 Pro – but the degree of the curve here is a lot sharper and less distracting than on other phones. There were still some accidental touches though, and the sheer size of the thing makes it difficult to comfortably hold without gripping it with two hands.
While the display is fantastic, it doesn’t have any fancy fast refresh-rate tech like the OnePlus 7 Pro. This is a shame, however you’re only really going to notice if you’ve been using that 7 Pro for an extended period. There’s still a small cutout hiding the front camera too, but this is far less distracting than on the S10 and S10 Plus.

The colours and punch of a Samsung OLED really are still some of the best in the business and the Note 10 Plus display is easily up there with the best displays on the market. It’s a little warmer and a lot more saturated than the screen on the iPhone 11 Pro: reds are richer and whites can be a little yellower. There’s support for HDR10 and HDR10+, with Samsung claiming the AMOLED panel can go above 1000nits. I couldn’t get it to register as such, but that’s likely down to it only boosting it up in certain circumstances.
The 3040 x 1440 resolution remains at the top of what’s available and, to me, it feels like a better choice than upping it to the 4K levels of the Xperia 1.
S Pen and software – The Note 10 Plus has a trick tucked inside and a focus on gaming
The S Pen is the true headline feature for the Note series and it is pretty much the only flagship around that lets you draw and take notes with a pen on the display. It’s a pleasure to write and doodle with, thanks to fantastic responsiveness and excellent palm-rejection.
The S Pen is very much the same as you’d find in a Note 9. It’s packing Bluetooth Low Energy so it can act as a remote for your phone, has a number of new ‘Air Gestures’ for zooming and altering the volume along with improved handwriting recognition. You can also use character recognition to search through notes you’ve handwritten via text. 
Like the S10, the Note 10 Plus runs Samsung’s new One UI interface over the top of Android 9. While it’s a big improvement over previous Samsung software, it still lacks some of the finesse of, say, Oxygen OS on a OnePlus 7 Pro.

Where One UI does impress is with its focus on making apps easier to use with one hand. With a phone as large as this, it’s good to see more parts of apps – the new message icon, in the SMS app for example – lower down the display, so you’re not stretching your thumb needlessly to the top. Samsung’s multitasking tools are great too, and you can enable a slick dark mode.
So, what’s new for especially Note 10 Plus? For one, you can now plug your device into either a Windows computer or Mac for access to a PC-like DeX UI. This is a nice idea and I really like it for quickly replying to messages and moving photos off the phone. However, the app (on the MacBook Pro I was using to test) is far too unreliable to get anything properly done: individual apps crash, the whole DeX app crashes and the phone becomes disconnected without me actually unplugging it. There is also some new gaming features and the ability to stream games from a compatible PC to the phone. 
Performance – The Galaxy Note 10 Plus is one of the most powerful phones around and there’s 5G option
As is usual with Samsung phones, there’s a variety of internals being used. In Europe, it’s the Exynos 9825 which is a slightly more efficient version of the S10’s 9820, while the US gets a Snapdragon version. This is the Snapdragon 855, rather than the slightly faster 855 Plus we’ve seen in a few gaming phones.

That chipset has been paired with 12GB RAM and you can pick between 256GB or 512GB of internal storage. It’s great to see Samsung completely ditching meagre levels of storage for such a high-end and expensive phone.
Throughout the near month of using the Galaxy Note 10 Plus I have been consistently impressed by just how fast it feels. Whether it’s gaming, general day-to-day scrolling or slightly more taxing tasks like editing large RAW photos or even cutting up and exporting 4K video, the Note 10 Plus does it all with ease.
As you can see from the benchmarking graphs below, the Note 10 Plus sits below the latest iPhone 11 (and previous iPhone XS) but still pumps out impressive scores. 
Rumours before release had suggested the Note 10 Plus would simply be a 5G phone in all its configurations. That’s not the case and you’ll have to pick up a specific version of the Note 10 Plus 5G to benefit. 
Audio from this phone is merely ok and this seems to be a side-effect of having basically no room for speakers. The same goes for phone call quality, which can often come across slightly distorted. At least Wi-Fi and cellular strength are excellent.

Battery life – The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus will get you through the day, though likely not much more
There’s a 4300mAh battery inside both the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus and its 5G-laden counterpart. Based on the 2019 Galaxy flagship family, this cell capacity is second only to the equally sizeable Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, which packs fractionally larger 4500mAh battery.
Based on the quoted size alone, the Note stands up well against most other flagship phones from the last year, all of which hover around or just above the 4000mAh mark. In practice, I was a little underwhelmed by the phone’s overall longevity, though.
With the phone holding brightness at around 75% for the majority of its use throughout the day, it mustered about 15 hours of uptime with five hours of screen-on time before exhausting itself. This included extensive media streaming, camera usage and a spat of gaming, collectively constituting heavy use, however, rivals like the Huawei P30 Pro, have managed longer screen-on times despite smaller battery capacities.
Separately, I was able to get the Note 10 Plus to deliver two full days of usage, which included 2.75 hours of screen-on time, paired with more considered usage. Out of the box, I had hoped Samsung’s latest powerhouse could manage a comfortable day and a half, but based on the use cases the company has built the phone for, and the demands that such scenarios require, I wouldn’t be confident recommending it for more than a day’s heavy use.
On the recharging side, the Note 10 Plus demonstrates greater versatility. For starters, it boasts convenient wireless charging and retains the S10 series’ Wireless PowerShare reverse wireless charging, which is best used (due to the slowish speeds) for recharging smaller-celled accessories, like the company’s own Galaxy Buds true wireless earphones.

I’d like to give Samsung a slap on the wrist for asking people to pay just shy of a £1000 for a smartphone that’s capable of impressive 45W fast charging but only including a 25W power adapter in-box, however, in real-world use, the Note still recharges impressively rapidly.
Using the 25W adapter, the Note 10 Plus consistently refilled in exactly 65 minutes, with a third of the battery full in just 15 and two thirds full after half an hour. Aside from the pleasingly speedy refill of such a large cell, I was pleasantly surprised by the presence of an on-screen charge indicator that includes an impressively accurate charge time counter, so you know just how long you have to wait until the phone is back to full strength.
Should I buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus?
The Galaxy Note 10 Plus is the true successor to the Note 9. It’s a brute of a phone with a lovely display, plenty of grunt and a huge battery. There isn’t a whole lot new when compared to the S10 – but this still stands as the true high-end Samsung phone for the end of 2019.
It also remains between this and the OnePlus 7 Pro for best big phone around. The Note 10 Plus has more features than the OnePlus – Qi charging, water-resistance, included USB-C buds – but I do love the 90Hz screen on the 7 Pro. Plus it’s notably cheaper than Samsung’s efforts.
Verdict
A fantastic big phone that’s easy to recommend thanks to a lovely screen, versatile cameras and very quick charging.

Verdict





























 



Asus has knocked it out of the park with the ROG Phone 2, with everything about it coming together to make it the best gaming phone money can buy, and a great phone across the board. 

If you dig its aggressive looks and don’t mind the lack of wireless charging or water-resistance, then when it comes to gaming and battery life, nothing else comes close. 



Pros

Sensational screen
Excellent battery life
Plenty of power and storage



Cons

It’s a big phone
No telephoto camera
No waterproofing






Key Specifications

Dual camera: 48-megapixel main, 13-megapixel ultra-wide
24-megapixel front camera
6000mAh battery with Quick Charge 4.0 support
512GB storage
Integrated fingerprint reader under the screen
Snapdragon 855 Plus CPU, 12GB RAM


The gaming phone space has filled out since the Razer Phone, and ROG Phone launched. 
Xiaomi’s sub-brand, Black Shark, has released two phones, ZTE’s sub-brand, Red has stuck a fan in its Magic 3’s chassis, and OnePlus has straddled two worlds with its masterfully balanced OnePlus 7 Pro – an affordable flagship that puts gaming front-and-centre with its 90Hz display. Asus knows the stakes, and it’s taking no prisoners with its ROG Phone 2, obliterating everything else out there when it comes to specs.
The ROG Phone 2 is loaded up with a giant 6.59-inch AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s also packing Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset, overclocked to 2.96GHz, paired with 12GB RAM. Need storage? The ROG Phone 2 has tonnes, with 512GB by default, and a 1TB version coming down the line, complete with a matte black finish. It also has the biggest battery on the block – 6000mAh – and supports fast-charging, up to Quick Charge 4.0 (30W).
Asus has overloaded its latest phone with gamer-specific highlights too, from L and R AirTriggers to squeezy sides which activate an overclocked X Mode, and there’s even a clip-on fan in the box. This isn’t just one of the best phones – it’s a totally over-the-top joy ride, so strap in and keep reading. 
Asus ROG Phone 2 Design – Glass, metal, rage and wrath unite
There’s no getting around the fact the ROG Phone 2 is enormous. It has a 6.59-inch screen, is 9.48mm tall – 1.3cm taller than the iPhone 11 Pro Max – and at 9.5mm thin, it is one of the thickest phones around.
The glass front is dominated by the display, which is bookended by a bit of bezel, stereo speakers and a selfie camera. Flip it around, and there’s an almost identical finish to that found on the original ROG Phone, with curved glass, a light-up ROG logo and a camera, not to mention some hangry looking glyphs that give the phone its aggressive design edge.

Not content with one USB-C port, the ROG Phone 2 has two, one at the bottom and one at the side, for in-game landscape charging and accessories. The volume and power buttons are on the right side, and there’s a headphone jack too. 
As with the first ROG Phone, the ROG Phone 2’s frame is black metal, but it does chip silver, which is a shame, I would have loved Asus to have anodised it (coloured the metal throughout).
As for gaming highlights, when held in landscape, there are left, and right touch-sensitive areas which act as AirTriggers, and a firm squeeze of the phone will fire up X Mode, which animates some wallpapers while also activating the RGB lights around the back and overclocking the CPU.

In the box, you’ll find a bumper case as well as a cooling fan, which can act as a kickstand if you affix rubber feet to its base, which can also be found in the box.
The ROG Phone 2’s design is going to be sensational for anyone who wants an angry-looking gaming phone with attitude, heft and gamer-centric additions. It might even work for you if you’re looking for a fantastically different looking phone brimming with geek-factor. If, however, you want a subtle, demure and easy-to-pocket device, you won’t find it here.
Asus ROG Phone 2 Screen – It doesn’t get much better than this
The ROG Phone 2 screen is one of our favourites of any smartphone out now. It isn’t the sharpest – the Sony Xperia 1 wears that crown – nor is it the brightest, with a peak brightness of 600 nits (the OnePlus 7T gets up to 1,000 nits). It isn’t even the only phone around with a 120Hz refresh rate – remember the Razer Phone 2? It’s also a touch higher in contrast than the tonally sensational Mate 30 Pro’s display, or the Galaxy Note 10 Plus.
However, it is the only OLED display to feature such a high refresh rate, and within the settings there’s more granular control over screen saturation than on any other phone around. So, whether you want a cinematic, desaturated look or a punchy world of Willy Wonka-style candy colours, the ROG Phone 2 has you covered.

The screen specs are also solid, with 2340 x 1080 resolution, 10-bit HDR capabilities and a 500,000:1 contrast ratio. Day-to-day, it also has strong viewing angles, depth in its blacks and is responsive.
Asus ROG Phone 2 Performance and gaming – Hear it whir
The Asus ROG Phone 2 is a powerhouse. Inside, its Snapdragon 855 Plus chipset is clocked at 2.96GHz and matched with 12GB DDR4X RAM to put it at the top of its game, and everything from gaming, through to UI swiping reflects that.
Benchmarks results are virtually identical to those of the OnePlus 7T, which has the same chipset, but the ROG Phone 2 looks that bit smoother thanks to that 120Hz screen.
Its side-mounted USB port gives users scope for charging the phone while landscape gaming comfortably, and is where you hook up the phone’s accessories.

It supports a new Kunai gamepad which packs some serious Nintendo Switch-factor. Comprised of left and right detachable portions, just like the Switch controller, these can slide onto a centrepiece to form a joystick, or latch on to either side of the ROG Phone (with a compatible case) to give it joy-con wings. Hook that set-up to the ROG Phone 2 clamshell second-screen case, and Asus has created a cross between a Nintendo Switch, 3DS and a Decepticon.
A handful of the original ROG Phone accessories, like the HDMI dock, will work for the ROG Phone 2, though given the fact the two have different dimensions, any accessories that require the phone slot into a case or housing will be device-specific. 
We got on well with the AirTriggers in our fortnight with the ROG Phone 2 – these are L and R triggers on the topside when holding the phone in landscape, just like those found on traditional games controllers and indeed, the original ROG Phone. 
This time around though, they have been refined with lower latency and faster haptic response. The ROG Phone 2 is also the first phone to feature two vibration motors, though their independent firing wasn’t particularly noticeable to us. 
With no less than three cooling mechanisms, as with the original, the phone ships with a clip-on fan, which combines with copper piping and vapour chamber cooling tech to keep frame rates high even when the action gets intense.
Running Android 9 with Asus’ Zen UI ROG Edition over the top, game and app support is set to be nothing short of excellent out of the box. In terms of actually hitting that coveted 120Hz mid-game, there are a handful of titles that support it. It isn’t just about the games though, the impact the phone’s smooth frame rates have when you aren’t gaming ensures day-to-day swiping has never looked so good. 
Asus ROG Phone 2 Battery life – More mAh than some laptops
With a huge 6000mAh of battery power inside, the Asus ROG Phone 2 is a bonafide 48-hour phone with light to regular use. It easily made it through a day and a half without much effort, and with a 30W HyperCharger included with the phone, you can charge it up to almost 50% in just 30 minutes – impressive. 
Screen-on time was also sensational, with the phone only losing 4% after 30 minutes of streaming at medium brightness at 120Hz, though dropping the screen refresh can extend the phone’s life, as too can a quick dip into the settings. 
Plenty of battery saving features can be accessed here, from startup app control, adaptive battery mode, which limits infrequently used apps from going rogue in the background, and more. Asus also includes an option to fire up Battery Care, extending the charge time so that the ROG Phone 2’s massive cell holds charge better throughout its long-term lifespan.

Asus ROG Phone 2 Software – Go stock or go grrr, either way, it’s silky smooth
The ROG Phone 2 runs Android 9 with Asus’s ROG UI over the top, and this time around, Asus has added a massive amount of versatility to the mix. 
While you can’t change the theme of the ROG Phone 2’s physical design, it’s always going to be a ridiculously angry-looking piece of kit, the UI is very customisable. Asus has added a virtually stock UI theme option as well as two more gamer-centric choices.
Navigation across both is as smooth as butter thanks to the 120Hz screen and CPU. It comprises of an apps tray, multiple home screens and a pull-down notifications and quick toggle menu. 
There’s also a suite of gaming enhancements that are at the heart of the ROG Phone 2’s experience within the Armory Crate app. Fire it up to access a carousel of your games – this is your Games Lobby. Here you can customise specific game profiles, tuning the display refresh rate, CPU speeds, audio levels and even screen touch sensitivity. 
An additional Console menu opens up control over the included fan’s speed and RGB lighting.

Asus ROG Phone 2 Camera – Wide, ultra-wide, but no zoom
Featuring the same dual-cameras as found on the Asus Zenfone 6, photography on the ROG Phone 2 is anything but an afterthought, though a notable omission is the telephoto camera as found on phones like the Huawei P30 Pro and Oppo Reno 10 X Zoom.

The main camera is a 48-megapixel IMX586 sensor coupled with a 13-megapixel ultrawide camera. Though unlike the flagship Zenfone 6, the ROG Phone 2 sports a separate front camera which clocks in at 24-megapixels, and is, according to Asus, positioned in an ideal spot for livestreaming. 
Image quality is solid in good light, with the ROG Phone 2 supporting either 12 or 48-megapixel resolutions. Auto-HDR only fires up when shooting at the lower resolution, but if the light’s right, ramp it up to 48-megapixels and you can grab more detail, compensating to a degree for the lack of zoom. 
Shooting modes are plentiful, with Auto, Portrait (which works well), Pro, Night and a neat Motion Tracking mode, which tracks objects across your scene. 
As for pure picture quality, the ROG Phone 2 is very competent, grabbing a lot of image information and handling challenging scenes well. Dynamic range is respectable, and in good light, it’s hard to fault, producing natural-looking shots. As soon as the lights drop though, artificial lighting or outdoor night conditions prove challenging in automatic mode. That said, fire up Night mode and things get a lot better. The portrait effects also work well too, and aren’t just reserved for faces, working well with inanimate objects and pets too.
     
Video is captured at up to 60fps at 4K and stabilisation works across resolutions, and there’s also no crop-factor when switching up resolutions either. The selfie camera is nice and sharp, though unlike Samsung flagships, it doesn’t feature autofocus so you’ll want to make sure you’re at arm’s length. 
The phone also sports four noise-cancelling microphones so you can stream with confidence in your audio. As for sound, thanks to the headphone jack, you can plug in your favourite gaming headset for a dongle-free session with the ROG Phone 2. Its stereo speakers are loud, too – clearly audible in a bustling room, and according to Asus, significantly louder than those of the original.
Should I buy the Asus ROG Phone 2?
If you want the most specced out phone right now, you can buy the ROG Phone 2 with confidence. It isn’t cheap, but when you think about just how many things about it outclass the competition, its price is easier to stomach. 
This phone has the smoothest screen around, the biggest battery and so much RAM, it keeps games and apps open in the background for hours. With all its gamer-centric enhancements and accessories, it’s the best gaming phone around, sure, but it’s also a joy to use for giant geeks who want a phone that looks like it fell off a Klingon warship.
You might miss having a telephoto camera, especially if you’re coming from a phone like the Mate 20 or P30 Pro, but its wide and ultra-wide cameras are both solid performers, making it a decent phone whichever way you look at it.
If you want something that has similar power but a lower price and a more mainstream look, the OnePlus 7T or 7 Pro could be great alternatives. Alternatively, the Black Shark 2 and Red Magic 2 are also compelling gaming alternatives with much lower price tags.
Verdict
Asus has knocked it out of the park with the ROG Phone 2 and it’s one of the best gaming phones, with everything about it coming together to make it the best gaming phone money can buy, and a great phone across the board. 
If you dig its aggressive looks and don’t mind the lack of wireless charging or water-resistance, then when it comes to gaming and battery life, nothing else comes close.

Verdict





























 



Even at launch, the Apple iPhone SE wasn't the most exciting phone that the company ever released, but it was a model that people had been clamouring for. A neat antidote to large phones, the iPhone SE was the last truly small iPhone. Now hard to find, bar as refurbished models, the iPhone SE isn't quite the recommend choice than it once was. Still, if you want a very small Apple handset, there's no alternative and the iPhone SE is still an alright phone, and you can even update it to run iOS 13.

What is the iPhone SE?
(UPDATED: Apple’s new affordable phone is here, and it brings back the SE name. You can read our iPhone SE 2 review for an in-depth look)
The iPhone SE is the last truly small iPhone that Apple launched. The same size as the older iPhone 5S, the SE slips easily into a pocket and is super-easy to use one-handed. Now, the handset is getting a little old, and it’s increasingly hard to find with only a few refurbished models available. Given that there doesn’t appear to be any sign that the iPhone SE 2 will ever be released, is this still the small phone to buy?
For many people, the answer will be yes. Thanks to the iPhone SE getting iOS 13, it can run the latest operating system, keeping it up-to-date. And, if the size is the most important thing to you, then this is the smallest iPhone that you can get by a long shot.
Yet, there’s no getting away from the fact that the iPhone SE is now a little old, and the iPhone 8 is faster and a better choice for most people looking for a cheaper iPhone, while the iPhone XR makes more sense if you want something with a more modern design, and the iPhone 11 can take care of your flagship needs.
iPhone SE Design, Screen and Audio – Small but perfectly formed
A surprising amount of people I speak to say they want a small phone that packs all the features of a full-fat flagship. Sony is the only manufacturer to have previously attempted anything like this, but even its Xperia Z5 Compact has a not-so-tiny 4.6-inch screen and it’s quite thick. The iPhone SE is much smaller and much easier to handle.
Anyone who’s used an iPhone 5 or iPhone 5S will feel at ease with the iPhone SE – it looks and feels almost identical, except now you can get it in a fetching rose-gold colour and its cut edges are matte rather than shiny chrome.
Those phones have an iconic design and I have no problem with Apple reusing it, especially if it means they can keep costs down and pass the savings on. The best thing about the design of the iPhone SE is that it still feels quality. The brushed aluminium back is both hard and cool to touch, the buttons are solid, and it’s easily small enough to use one-handed, regardless of the size of your hands.
Related: iPhone XS review

Coming from using the giant iPhone 6S Plus and Huawei Mate 8 I also found it a relief to be able to bend my leg again when I put a phone in my front pocket.
Related: Best iPhone Deals
In other ways it’s taken me time to adjust to the smaller screen. It’s not just that I have to move it closer to my face to read text, like my granddad reading the morning paper, I also struggle with the small keyboard. Ironically I often have to use both my hands and thumbs on the phone to minimise the potential for embarrassing autocorrect fails. I’ve gotten more used to it, but I still don’t find it comfortable after a few weeks of using the phone non-stop. The small screen also means watching video is a little cramped and, while the iPhone SE is more than powerful enough to play all the best games, trying to manoeuvre precisely requires daintier digits than mine.
This really is a tiny phone by modern standards
While the iPhone SE still looks good there are a couple of aspects of the design that aren’t perfect, and others that feel dated. For starters, if you don’t use a case with the iPhone SE you might find the edges a little harsh, particularly if you’re more used to the rounded metal sides on contemporary phone designs. The screen bezel is also rather wide – especially at the top and bottom – and that means you don’t get a lot of screen for the size of the phone.
That’s not the only problem with the screen.
It packs the exact same display as the 5S. While the 1136 x 640 resolution provides a perfectly sharp 326 pixels per inch the screen lacks punch and has a reddish tinge that is exacerbated when it’s tilted at some angles. Compare it to Samsung’s colour-packed Super AMOLED screens or even the newer LCD technology on a phone like the HTC 10 and it really starts looking its age.
Still, it’s quite acceptable – bright enough to be used outdoors and sharp enough to read websites on the go without noticing any fuzzy edges to letters.
The speakers are decent
The speaker located at the bottom of the phone is decent rather than outstanding. Top-level volume isn’t as high as some other phones, but the quality of the audio output is surprisingly good from such a small package – sound is balanced, if a little thin, and there’s no distortion at the highest volume.
Call quality is also strong. The ear speaker is clear and loud and the noise-cancelling mic does a good job of clearing up any distracting external noises when you’re on a call. There are louder call speakers out there but I didn’t have any problems hearing or making myself heard even on windy days with lots of traffic noise around me.
Related: iOS 13 features
Neither the design, screen or sound quality excites the blood much – so far the iPhone SE isn’t very different at all when compared to its predecessors. That all changes, though, when I scratch the surface and take the camera for a spin around London.

Verdict





























 



Coming in at less than £200, the Huawei P Smart 2019 is a surprisingly robust smartphone experience wrapped up in an eye-catching ""ceramic-like"" finish. While the cost may be low, the P Smart 2019 packs in a surprising amount of features that let this handset punch above its weight. Most impressive is its dual 13/2-megapixel primary camera, which packs in a surprising amount of features and can even take usable low-light photos. With the latest version of Android, which comes with an impressive set of additional features, a large battery and decent processor, this is an impressive phone at a very reasonable price. 



Pros

Robust camera experience
Feature-rich software
Affordable



Cons

Poor earpiece speaker placement
Fingerprint-prone plastic build
microUSB is now dated

What is the Huawei P Smart 2019?
The popularity of the affordable P Smart has landed the line a successor for 2019, the not-so-imaginatively-titled, Huawei P Smart 2019. This latest model keeps its predecessor’s low price but continues the trend of packing in a range of quality features including an impressive camera.
Externally, you’d be hard-pushed to see that this is a budget handset, as it has many of the features that you’d expect to see on a higher-end model, including an extended screen with a camera notch cut into it, rounded corners and Android Pie, which includes Huawei’s Emotion UI on top. Huawei has announced that the P Smart 2019 will get Android 10, too.
One of the main issues that Huawei has is its retraction of the Android licence, which means that phones will no longer ship with Google Play Services and many Android apps, including YouTube and Gmail will not be available. However, existing phones, including the P Smart 2019, still have their licence so will continue to have Google Play access even after an operating system upgrade.
As such, this phone should still be a safe buy but the relationship between Google and Huawei may be enough to put you off buying this handset, and you may want to look at an alternative phone, such as the impressive and similarly-priced Xiaomi Redmi Note 7.

Huawei P Smart 2019 design – Very smart to look at but a bit cheap in the hand
The first thing that struck me when seeing the back of the P Smart was how it reminded me of phones like Xiaomi’s recently-launched flagship, the Mi Mix 3, and that’s a good thing too, as the company describes the body of the P Smart 2019 as delivering a “ceramic-like finish”.
The ceramic-like finish looks great but feels a bit cheap
Like the Mi Mix 3, which uses an actual ceramic back, the P Smart’s glossy black rear (it’s also available in Aurora Blue and Sapphire Blue) offers the same silvery reflective quality as the real thing.
Touch or press against it, however, and you’ll immediately see through the phone’s ruse – this is a plastic-backed device and as such it doesn’t feel all that premium to wield. Not to mention the immediate adoption of smudges and fingerprints that appear from even a moment’s handling. Materials aside, the rounded form gives the P Smart a cute, compact appearance – despite its size.

Smudge magnet: Both the front and back of the P Smart are prone to fingerprints
There’s a centrally positioned rear fingerprint sensor that’s nice and snappy, and lets you summon the notifications tab with a swipe, while the main dual camera sits, tucked up in the top left corner, not unlike Apple’s iPhone X and XS lines.
The fingerprint sensor is in the perfect spot
A glance across the phone’s base and many will be pleased to hear that the P Smart is one of the few handsets still offering an integrated 3.5mm headphone jack, especially as more premium Huawei phones, like the Mate 20 Pro, shed such hardware generations ago. This, paired with wired headphones (included in-box) is also what facilitates the phone’s FM radio function.
What you might be surprised to find (as I was) is a microUSB port. In 2019, this, like the headphone jack, is of a growing scarcity; conceding to the newer, more efficient and versatile reversible USB Type-C standard that most phones released within the last year now use.
The microUSB port feels a bit old fashioned
Huawei would no doubt reason, as with Honor and its similarly-equipped Honor 10 Lite, that the P Smart’s budget-conscious target audience is likely better equipped to slot a microUSB-toting handset into their current tech lifestyle compared to a USB-C-based one; I’d argue that they’re reaching, just a little bit.
Huawei P Smart 2019 Screen – Decent size and resolution but viewing angles could be better
One of those key 2018 mobile trends was the rapid adoption of extended displays, a trait kicked off by the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S8 a year earlier. The 6.21-inch IPS LCD on the P Smart sports a long 19.5:9 aspect ratio, so despite granting you sizeable screen real estate, the phone isn’t nearly as wide as it would be if Huawei had stuck with a more traditional 16:9 aspect ratio.
This “FullView” display gives the phone a tall, slim appearance. It’s nice to wield in one hand and the company has even managed to keep the bezels fairly svelte too; not a guarantee where affordable smartphones are concerned. There’s still an undeniable ‘chin’ of bezel running the bottom edge of the handset, while the top is where you’ll spot a notch.
Impressively thin bezels surround the screen
The “Dewdrop” display became a standard element among Huawei’s 2018 smartphone lineup and the P Smart 2019 carries that detail straight through into the new year. Despite Huawei’s rather elegant description, citing it as “pearl-shaped”, the notch juts out into the display real-estate far more aggressively than the likes of the OnePlus 6T‘s more gradual take.
Even so, it’s small and unobtrusive enough that it won’t mess with the interface of apps all that much and if you do run into an incompatibility with third-party software, you have the option to scale apps back to better fit within the dimensions of the screen without the notch encroaching at all.
If you really aren’t a fan of the notch, you can also hide it behind a software-based black bar, but in my opinion this looks ugly, giving the P Smart an unsightly and unbalanced ‘forehead’ that’s even more noticeable than the bezel’s chin.
As for display quality, Huawei says that the 1080 x 2340 Full HD+ panel is equipped to deliver on 85 percent of the NTSC colour gamut. In real-world use, colours are fine, pleasing even on first glance, but it pays to fiddle around with things. By default, the P Smart’s display is set to “vivid” mode, but thanks to the robust settings options, it’s easy to tone things down if visuals are too punchy or you want to manually adjust hue and colour temperature.
Contrast is a little lacking, with blacks appearing more like a dark grey that can shift to an even lighter tone when the screen is viewed off-axis. Viewing angles aren’t great but keep the phone parallel to your eyes and you’ll have little to complain about, visually speaking.
As well as general customisation over the display’s colour output, the phone also boasts a (TÜV Rheinland-certified) Eye Comfort mode that shifts colour temperature to the warmer end of the scale for easier viewing in low light and late at night. It can be configured to kick in and switch off manually or you can set it to automatically step in based on sunrise and sunset times.
It’s a feature that’s now commonplace on both Android and iPhone stock but it’s nice to have such a feature on a more affordable phone like the P Smart – another feature that isn’t guaranteed at the lower end of phone market.
Huawei P Smart 2019 performance – Great for normal use and the phone can handle games
The Huawei Mate 20 Lite comes with an RRP of £380, for almost half that price 2019’s P Smart brings the same Kirin 710 processor found inside the Lite to the table. Despite being paired with only 3GB of RAM (a relatively paltry amount for an Android phone in 2019), it’s perfectly well-equipped for your everyday smartphone needs.
What’s more, thanks to some optimisation from Huawei, the GPU Turbo 2.0 update also means the P Smart delivers a decent enough gaming experience on titles that I would have assumed would have been above this phone’s capabilities.

In general usage, you’ll seldom run into any obvious usability issues. The phone feels responsive as you navigate around home screens and between apps when multitasking; you might notice dropped frames when transitioning into split-screened usage and other more specialist UI features (like picture-in-picture with Netflix), but nothing debilitating or apparent lasts long enough to be a real problem.

The new Honor 10 Lite sports practically identical underlying hardware and having just reviewed that phone, I was pleasantly surprised by how gaming performance compares between the two. The 10 Lite struggled to run 3D games outright, while Huawei appears to have done a better job optimising the P Smart 2019, meaning more intensive 3D titles are genuinely playable.
While the P Smart 2019 has some game, it gave up the ghost every time I tried testing 3D Mark’s more intensive Sling Shot Extreme benchmark; indication enough of the available power on-hand.
I didn’t start losing frames (and thus gameplay fluidity) by any significant degree until I was thirty minutes into playing Crash of Cars, and less demanding 2D titles like Alto’s Odyssey don’t seem to make the Kirin 710 sweat at all. Despite this, the P Smart is certainly not a phone for hardcore gamers, there simply isn’t enough power under the hood to guarantee a consistently smooth and competitive gameplay experience.
As for call quality, those on the receiving end had little issue with voice clarity and background noise suppression but not unlike the Oppo Find X, the narrow bezel and notch have forced the earpiece placement to butt up against the top of the P Smart’s frame, meaning it sounds as if incoming voices are firing out the top or the back of the phone, rather than directly into your ear.
Clarity is still good but it’s unquestionably a disconcerting experience from what you’re likely used to – not to mention everyone immediately around you will probably hear what the person on the other end of your call is saying to you, whether you want them to or not.
Huawei P Smart 2019 Software – Android Pie for now, Android 10 soon
As affordable handsets go, the latest and greatest Android release isn’t always a guarantee but luckily, Huawei has graced this latest P Smart with Android Pie; albeit dressed with the company’s own user experience on top. Android 10 is coming to the phone, too

Huawei’s Emotion UI overlay is far less bloated and far more user-friendly than it used to be but it still makes for a notable departure from stock Android. EMUI 9.0.1 as it appears on the P Smart offers customisation over everything from home screens and animation behaviour, to automated power on/off times, plus there are some intriguing new additions that may hold value for some users, although I suspect their appeal will be niche.
HiTouch is a recent addition to EMUI that lets you find and purchase goods from platforms like Amazon, just by pressing two fingers against a relevant image on-screen. It’s fairly accurate, provided you’re going for a popular or common item, but unless you’re a shopaholic there’s every chance this feature might pass you by. Those after that Instagram model’s killer dress or shades, however, will find HiTouch invaluable.

There are some more worthwhile inclusion, like Digital Balance – Huawei’s take on Android Pie’s new native digital wellbeing tools, which can be set to track your app usage on a regular basis and provide insight into unhealthy smartphone habits, like an Instagram addiction or how often you Twitter binge. What’s more, you can set allowances for select apps, stopping you from using them after a set allocation of time each day, unless you actively choose to bypass the limit.
Digital Balance also features a mode called “Bedtime”, which greys out the interface to make it less palatable to use in the evenings, when you should be reducing device usage and letting your brain rest ahead of sleep.

It might seem odd that Huawei has included a feature that actually promotes less smartphone usage but in this health-conscious day and age, and with the growing recognition of problems such as smartphone addiction, there’s unquestionable worth in something like Digital Balance, especially among younger users – the P Smart’s target audience.
Huawei P Smart 2019 Camera – A surprising amount of features and decent low-light performance
There’s a dual camera setup on the back of the P Smart 2019, split between a 13-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel secondary sensor; in place to provide depth data for a gamut of features built into the phone’s imaging setup. That notch, meanwhile, sports an 8-megapixel fixed-focus front-facer, complete with basic face unlock functionality that works decidedly well, even in low light.
Huawei has been trickling AI-enhanced smarts down throughout its product portfolio for a little while now and even the humble P Smart, thanks in part to the Kirin 710 processor inside, now also boasts AI scene recognition that’s able to distinguish between 500 unique scenes, divvied out across 22 categories.
In testing, the P Smart 2019 was able to define scenarios like “snow”, “room”, “blue sky” and “plant”, automatically adjusting settings accordingly.
Related: Best camera phones
Just how much of an effect these AI-controlled settings adjustments have on a shot appears to vary based on the scenario in question but unlike pricier handsets, such as the Mate 20 Pro, I prefer to have AI shooting switched on when using the P Smart’s cameras.

In natural light, the P Smart’s cameras do a decent job of capturing scenes with accurate colour, contrast and detail. You don’t have to crop in much to see that finer details are a little murky but if all you’re after is a camera for occasionally posting to Instagram, this phone’s snappers should more than meet your requirements.
Enabling AI in natural light pushes image quality just that little bit further.
With no auto-HDR shooting, you’ll have to switch to a dedicated mode in the P Smart 2019’s settings, however, the results make it worthwhile.
Even with AI enabled, artificial lighting produces a notable drop in detail and exposes the phone’s relatively narrow dynamic range.
AI (below) helps reduce noise in low light…
…however, the P Smart’s dedicated Night Mode (below) is the only way to truly capture usable shots in low light, provided your subject isn’t moving around.

Macro photography: AI (below) boosts colours, making for a nicer image with more ‘pop’.

The P Smart’s front camera supports a surprisingly in-depth set of beauty tools. Low light conditions don’t play well with the 8-megapixel sensor, though.
Even without the secondary depth sensor of the main camera, the phone’s front-facer can render surprisingly convincing bokeh (background blur).
Beyond photography, the P Smart 2019 also includes some more AI-assisted Huawei technology in HiVision. An extension of HiTouch and accessed from within the camera, HiVision consolidates image recognition for search and shopping purposes, as well as real-time translation and QR code-scanning functionality into a single experience.
The translate feature, in particular, seems near-useless based on my testing, while the other features work as advertised. Like HiTouch, though, I wonder whether HiVision is going to appeal to anyone beyond a very niche band of prospective P Smart owners.
Huawei P Smart 2019 Battery Life – Big battery means impressive times between charges
Humble hardware and a large battery are often an appealing pairing and such a combination stands the P Smart 2019 in good stead, as far as longevity is concerned. Despite offering a (conventionally less efficient compared to OLED) Full HD LCD, in real-world testing, the P Smart is capable of up to two days of usage per charge.
The relatively big battery means this phone lasts a decent amount of time per charge
I finished day one (8am to 11pm) with 63 percent power left and just over 1.5 hours of screen-on time under my belt, killing the phone outright by the end of day two (again 8am to 11pm) with a further 2 hours of screen-on time. For reference, the similarly-equipped Honor 10 Lite doled out 4.5-hours of screen-on time in total but hit low battery (below 20 percent) by the end of one day’s use.
30 minutes of an intensive 3D game like Crash of Cars sucked up 9 percent of the sizeable 3400mAh cell’s juice, while half an hour of Netflix (at 50 percent brightness) used up approximately the same amount of charge (11 percent).
I’ve been spoilt by testing phones with such impressive fast-charging technologies that the P Smart’s 10W solution seems a bit pedestrian by comparison, however, it does at least ensure you can recharge the phone from flat in under two hours.
Why buy the Huawei P Smart 2019?
Huawei has done an excellent job of bringing a fully-featured smartphone experience down into a phone that somehow manages to duck below the £200 threshold. The build is one of the phone’s biggest shortcomings but whether that doesn’t bother you or you simply plan on sticking a case on it, there’s so much else on offer that this one aspect is worth overlooking.
The EMUI software still needs work but includes so much functionality it’s hard to hate on all that much. The camera experience is feature-packed too, with meaningful AI enhancement that clearly helps improve images from the phone’s run-of-the-mill camera hardware.
A large battery with up to two days longevity and Full HD visuals from a panel that seems to sit far above this phone’s price point mean the P Smart is also a worthwhile choice for media junkies on a budget.

Verdict



































The iPhone XR is an excellent phone now at an even better price. It offers a lot of the features of the new iPhone 11 and even comes in some colours you might prefer.  Some might argue the screen lacks a high resolution. While they’re not wrong, the display here is still nice and colourful. The camera also isn’t as good as the dual-lens array on the iPhone 11.



Pros
Great battery lifeXS features for less moneyFantastic performanceVery capable camera

Cons
No fast charger includedWill be too large for some

Key Specifications
CPU: very fast A12 Bionic chipsetScreen: LCD, 1792 x 828 & notchFace ID: Same as the iPhone XSCamera: 12-megapixel & portrait mode


iPhone XR Design – The perfect sized iPhone?
The iPhone XR doesn’t feel as ‘classy’ as the pricier iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max but the aluminium band is less slippery than the latter’s stainless steel. The 6.1-inch screen size is also a nice compromise between the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro and 6.5-inch 11 Pro Max. it’s the exact same size and weight as the iPhone 11.
Related: iPhone 12 review
There’s glass on both the front and the back, and it holds an IP67 rating, meaning it can be submerged in a variety of liquids for up to 30 minutes. But there’s still no headphone jack here, and not even a 3.5mm dongle inside the box.

Even though it follows the near edge-to-edge look of all the new iPhones since the iPhone X, there’s a thicker bezel here surrounding the display. This becomes slightly more prominent when you’re using a coloured variation of the iPhone XR. With my red review unit, for example, the black bezel stands out more against its bright red sides.
Being able to pick up this phone in a variety of colours makes it a bit more interesting. There’s a pinky-orange coral, a vivid red and a couple of more pastel shades of blue and yellow. For those who want something a bit more conservative, there are also white and black options. The range of colours is great and there isn’t one that stands out as looking ugly: they’re all coloured well and each reacts a bit differently when light hits its glass back.
iPhone XR Screen – Don’t come here looking for OLED
Apple is calling this a Liquid Retina display, a moniker it has also attached to the iPad Pro 2018. After using it for an extended period, I honestly think it’s fine. If you’re coming from an iPhone 7 or 8, you’ll feel right at home. It’s the same display as the iPhone 11.
LCD lacks the punchy colours, perfect blacks and support for Dolby Vision/HDR10 that the OLED on iPhone XS and iPhone 11 Pro gives you. But in normal use colours are still pleasant and you can’t spot individual pixels unless you really go searching for them. 
To my eyes, the screen is a little more yellow than the iPhone OLEDs. However, that might just be the True Tone (Apple’s software tweak that makes colours softer on your eyes in certain environments) tech doing a bit too much work.
Like all of Apple’s current iPhones, the screen is ridiculously responsive. The panel itself remains 60Hz but the touch-layer is 120Hz and your swipes and taps are registered instantly.

Impressively, Apple has managed to ensure the curves in the corners of the screen and around the protruding notch are perfectly uniform – without any stray pixels or wonky edges. This is done through a combination of pixel-masking and anti-aliasing, and the results are excellent. Look at any competing Android phones with LCDs and curved corners, and you’ll notice ugly jagged edges.
Sitting at the top of the screen is a notch – a small-ish cutout, where the bevy of Face ID sensors and front-facing cameras sit. Your feelings on the notch will likely be very varied and that’s fair – it does get in the way when watching videos. For everything else, it blends into the background and doesn’t detract from what’s on the display.
iPhone XR Performance – Still fantastic
Powering the iPhone XR is Apple’s A12 Bionic SoC (system on a chip) paired with 3GB of RAM. This is the same chipset used in the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. However, both of those phones have 4GB RAM.
Being a 7nm chip, as opposed to the 10nm chip of the A11 Bionic, allows a greater number of transistors to be packed inside the silicone. This leads to a more efficient chip. The main features for the new chip are a 15% faster CPU, 50% faster GPU (both when compared with the A11 Bionic) and a new neural engine for AI. There’s also an updated ‘secure enclave’ inside the chip that aids the snappier Face ID.
The general processor improvements aren’t huge when compared with the 2017 iPhones. But for anyone updating from an iPhone 6, iPhone 6S or iPhone 7, you’ll notice everything moves a lot quicker. Apps open instantly, there’s no jank when multitasking and I’ve noticed app crashes are very rare.
There’s so much power available here that you’ll likely not utilise it all straight away. Apple’s having a big push with augmented reality (AR) and this will demand more power when developers really start to push it to its limits.

The A12 Bionic should also allow the iPhone XR to stay fast for multiple years. When you think Apple has only just stopped selling the four-year-old iPhone 6S, it becomes obvious this iteration will be around for a long time. 
The iPhone XR is a great pick too if you’re an avid mobile gamer. It doesn’t pack some of the fancy features you get with the Razer Phone 2 (120Hz refresh rate) or ROG Phone (a mix of gaming-focused accessories). But instead, it offers plenty of power and the wide-range of excellent games available on the App Store. Intensive titles, such as Asphalt 9 and PUBG, run fantastically well and match the pricier iPhone 11 Pro for loading and frame rates.



Apple has completely moved away from Touch ID fingerprint unlocking. Putting so much faith in its Face ID facial unlocking means it has to work reliably. Thankfully, Apple succeeds with this: Face ID is reliable at bursting into life when you look at the phone and it works even in a pitch-black environment.
Unlike some more basic facial authentication systems on other phones, Face ID can’t be fooled by a photo and learns your appearance over time. You won’t have to retrain it if you get a haircut or shave off a bushy beard. It comfortably recognised me with or without my glasses.
iPhone XR will likely be a lot of people’s first experience with Face ID and I can’t see many of them being disappointed.
The speakers (one of which sits on the bottom and other in the notch) are louder and clearer than those on any previous iPhone, matching excellent Android handsets out there. Apple has levelled out the sound so that the downward speaker is no longer more powerful. This gives you a more balanced sound that isn’t dominated in a particular area.
iPhone XR Software – Now even better with iOS 13
When the iPhone XR was first launched in September 2018 it came with iOS 12. If you buy one now it’ll be upgraded to iOS 13.
The general user interface remains the same: swipe up from the lock screen to access the standard gridded view of your apps. A left swipe brings up the Today view: a space for widgets to sit. It’s all very basic and will be familiar to anyone who has ever used an iPhone or iPad.
Related: How to update apps in iOS 13
iOS 13 isn’t a huge overhaul of the software that has powered iPhones for years. Big new features this time around include a completely remade, and much improved, Photos app, plenty of UI tweaks and, of course, Dark Mode. Enable this and all system apps will turn a nice shade of grey.
Thanks to the Face ID system, there’s Animoji and Memoji on the iPhone XR. These augmented reality emojis blend your facial animations with various characters and can be pretty addictive. They’re limited to iMessage, which seems odd. Surely there must be plans to brand them off into a singular app?
Due to the lack of a physical home button, your main interaction with the iPhone XR is through a selection of gestures. Swipe up from the bottom to go to the Home Screen, pull down from the top left for notifications and top right for Control Center. Once you’ve got over the initial learning curve, it’s mostly a straightforward process.

Verdict



































Apple has seen what most people want from the iPhone 11. Unless you’re a complete sucker for an OLED display, or particularly want the zoomed telephoto lens, there isn’t much you’re missing out on by not getting the Pro model. Especially when you consider the over £300/$300 saving you’re making. If you’re coming from an iPhone XR you might want to wait a year and see what the 2020 iPhone brings. However, if you’re updating an older iPhone then you’ll notice the vast array of improvements to camera, battery life and overall design straight away.



Pros
Great cameraStrong battery lifeNice colour varietyGood value

Cons

The iPhone 11 is the successor to the excellent iPhone XR and it is the best overall iPhone you can buy this year.
iPhone 11 takes the iPhone XR, keeps the design virtually unchanged and alters the internals. There are now two cameras on the back, for example, and the same A13 chipset you’ll find in the Pro model.
Below we’ll talk about the new iPhone’s camera, display, performance, design and battery life. We’ve been using the iPhone 11 since its release so that’s several months now, and as you would hope it is standing up well.
Related: Read our iPhone 12 review
It has received a number of iOS updates that have sorted a number of early software issues we had with – notably the system-wide search functions properly again – and our review unit hasn’t picked up any obvious dings or dents even though it’s not being used with a case.
Since the iPhone 11 hit shelves, we’ve also seen the Pixel 4 debut. Even though in some situations Google’s flagship takes better pictures, the versatility of the iPhone camera shines through.
Camera – The iPhone 11 camera is an excellent improvement in so many ways
As the camera is such a vital part of the new iPhone 11 series, and because it is just so darn good, we’ve got a dedicated iPhone 11 camera review page featuring an extended, in-depth look at the duo of cameras on the back of this phone – along with a look at how it compares to two of our favourite competing Android phones.
The shorter verdict is that these new rear cameras are excellent. Even though the iPhone 11 is a lot more affordable than the Pro models, it retains exactly the same wide angle 12-megapixel optical image stabilised (OIS) main sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and the same 12-megapixel ultra wide angle camera (f/2.4).
The only thing you’re missing out on is the telephoto, 2x ‘optical’ zoomed camera that sits on the Pro. I’d take ultra wide angle over zoomed any day, so it’s a fair trade in my eyes. When comparing photos from the Pro and 11 I can’t see any differences at all.
There are two cameras on the back of the iPhone 11
This ultra wide camera lets you cram so much more into your shots and it’s ideal for landscapes, however it’s a smaller sensor with a slower lens so it can’t match the main sensor for pure quality. Still, the versatility it adds is fun to shoot with and I have constantly been jumping to it when I think there’s an interesting shot available.
iPhone 11 (left) vs Pixel 3 (right) (drag the slider to compare the two photos)
It’s far from a new thing for phones to pack such a sensor, but it’s great to see Apple adding one here anyway. Apple has also added 4K60 video recording, made improvements to its Smart HDR feature that was introduced last time around and has finally built a Night mode into the camera app for much better shooting when the light is poor.
Snaps taken with the Night mode automatically enabled are, on the whole, fantastic. You get clean, crisp photo which matches – and can exceed – the Pixel 3 and P30 Pro. There seems to be more detail retained with the P30 Pro, but that’s something which is only hugely noticeable at larger sizes than a phone screen.
iPhone 11 (left) vs Pixel 3 (right) (drag the slider to compare the two photos)
Pictures taken in less taxing environments are predictably excellent. Detail has been dramatically upped from the previous iPhones and, to my eye, dynamic range is better – giving you a clearer definition between the lightest and darkest elements of the picture.

Other phones might be able to match the iPhone 11 in terms of general picture quality, however the iPhone’s video capabilities are head and shoulders above the rest. You can shoot on both cameras up to 4K60fps and the colours and tone are well-balanced across both.
The front camera now boasts 12 megapixels and can now capture, erm, ‘slofies‘. These slow-motion selfies are surprisingly fun but also a bit gimmicky. You’ll likely use it once and then forget it’s there.

For more on the camera including loads of photo samples check out our in-depth iPhone 11 camera page.

Design – The DNA of the iPhone XR lives on and that’s a good thing
Apple seems more settled than usual with the designs of its trio of iPhones. The iPhone 11 Pro line has been virtually unchanged since the iPhone X arrived and just about killed the bezel, while the iPhone 11 keeps the same look and feel as the iPhone XR.
It still weighs the same, at 194g, keeps the 8.3mm thickness, and were it not for the redesigned camera module on the back and slightly more muted array of colours, it would look identical to the phone it’s replacing.
That means you’ve got a device that feels a lot sturdier than the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max with a rigid aluminium frame and a glass back. Apple claims that the glass used here is the ‘toughest glass on a smartphone’ thanks to a “dual ion-exchange strengthening process“, and this covers both the front and back.
What that really means for you, if you accidentally drop your shiny new phone on a stone floor, remains to be seen. I have already seen plenty of examples of cracked iPhone 11s. Surprisingly, Apple’s case line for the iPhone 11 is weak, with the leather and silicone options reserved for the pricier Pro – in its place you’ve got a fairly cheap-feeling plastic case.
The IP water resistance rating has also been upped to IP68, matching the iPhone XS. This means protection in water up to 1.5m deep for up to half an hour.
Where the design differences are most obvious is the new, larger camera housing. The iPhone 11 adds a second camera into the mix, making both sensors physically larger in the process. These are cameras that really stand out and become part of the phone’s design, rather than blending in.
Even though they look quite bulbous in pictures, the cameras don’t jut out too much from the back of the phone and I actually like the way they look. There’s even a nice contrasting matte square housing the camera sensors and flash that adds a bit of flair. You will notice the phone doesn’t sit flush to a surface if you put it on a table, making it a bit annoying to type without holding the phone.
iPhone 11 mirrors the XR in terms of looks
The iPhone XR introduced bright colours to the iPhone line for the first time since the often derided iPhone 5C and they remain here. For the iPhone 11, Apple has muted some of the brighter colours, giving them more of a pastel finish. I’ve been using the purple hue and I am a big fan – having a more saturated purple would have looked gaudy. You’ve also got a green that reminds me of a seventies bathroom suite, a light yellow and more traditional colours like white and black. A deep Product(RED) version rounds off the selection.
A year on from the iPhone XR, and two from the iPhone X, I do have to say this design is starting to feel slightly in need of a refresh. While the iPhone 11 remains a good-looking phone, the overly-large notch and slightly thicker-than-expected bezel look dated when compared to Samsung Galaxy S10 and OnePlus 7 Pro. If you’re coming from an older, pre-iPhone X device then you’ll see huge improvements. This is a much more manageable device than, say, the iPhone 8 Plus and it crams a bigger screen into a smaller overall footprint.
I find the iPhone 11’s size the best out of any iPhone: more screen to play with than the 11 Pro without feeling overly bulky and heavy. It’s the perfect mix and I wish the 11 Pro came in this size.
(drag the slider to compare the two photos)
Screen – The iPhone 11 screen is its least impressive trait
The screen remains the same as the iPhone XR too, likely to the dismay of many people. The 6.1-inch ‘Liquid Retina LCD’ still falls below the competition in terms of resolution and it would have been nice to see the 1792 x 828 panel upgraded to a 1080p version.
Does it make that much of a difference? Not really, no. If you go pixel-peeping with an iPhone 11 Pro and a high-end Android phone next to it you will notice a little less sharpness, but this is a bright and colour-rich display that comes in at the perfect size. 
True Tone is onboard for altering harsh hues depending on your environment and you can bring the screen to life by raising it or tapping. 
Even more than a resolution boost, I would have liked Apple to go full-on OLED across the whole iPhone range. The deeper colours and inky black of the iPhone 11 Pro are hard to return from and this remains the biggest weakness with the iPhone 11’s display.
The screen can’t match the iPhone 11 for resolution
Battery life – The iPhone 11 battery life isn’t the range’s best, but it’s close
The iPhone XR seriously impressed when it came to endurance, outlasting the ‘Plus’ model iPhones and comfortably sitting as the Apple flagship with the best battery life.
The iPhone 11 Pro Max might have bagged that award with its massive improvements over the iPhone XS Max, but the iPhone 11 is still a really long-lasting phone that I found went slightly further than its predecessor on a single charge.
Apple’s claim of ‘all-day battery life’ feels completely genuine and throughout the review process there were a few days when I took the phone off charge one morning and didn’t plug it back in until midday at my desk the following day. That’s even with the slightly heavier usage that comes with getting to grips with a new phone. Some other days I was hitting the red by 10pm and I noticed the battery drains a lot faster when you’re shooting a lot of photos and video.
Apple phones have always impressed me more than Android counterparts when it comes to battery drain during intensive tasks like gaming and streaming. I’ve been getting deep into of the excellent Apple Arcade titles and 30 minutes of Oceanhorn 2 ate through 8% – pretty impressive going.
What’s less impressive is the 5w charger you’ll find in the box. Not including a fast charger is clearly a cost-cutting measure and it remains a real downer against this phone. The included charger has always felt slow and that feeling is even more obvious now that the iPhone 11 Pro models come with an 18w charger.
In 30 minutes of charging the iPhone 11 with the included plug and Lightning cable it went from dead to just 13% – hardly ideal if you’re in a rush and forgot to plug your phone in the night before. In the same amount of time, charging with the 18w plug you’ll find in the Pro’s box, it got to 38%. I’d suggest that – if you’re willing to spend a bit more – you should pick up the Apple 18w plug (£29) and USB-C to Lightning cable (£19) alongside the iPhone 11.
There’s wireless Qi charging too (7.5w) which is actually faster than the basic plug – so long as you’ve got a compatible pad.
The battery life on the iPhone 11 is impressive, no doubt, but it’s far from the overall battery champion. If you really care about battery, and aren’t put off by the move to Android, then phones like the Huawei P30 Pro – along with far cheaper options like the Moto G7 Power – are far more impressive.
Performance – Speed isn’t a problem for the iPhone 11
Inside the iPhone 11 you’ll find Apple’s A13 Bionic chipset and, according to the Geekbench benchmarking app, 4GB RAM. This is a seriously fast piece of silicone that outperforms every Android phone we’ve reviewed in benchmarks, and it feels equally as snappy in general day-to-day use.
Of course this is Apple’s fastest chip ever and that’s to be expected. Apple has full control over its hardware and software and this has always left Android phones trailing in the iPhone’s wake when it comes to benchmark and performance scores.
Yet, I am not sure anyone coming from an iPhone 8, iPhone X or XS will notice the differences right away. Swiping around iOS is smooth, apps open instantly and you’ll never be left waiting for something to load – and I would have said the exact same thing when I unboxed and started using any previous iPhone.
Where the difference will likely make themselves apparent is a few years down the line. I am confident in saying this will be a fast phone in two or three years time, and that’s really what sets iPhones apart. I didn’t suffer any poor performance while gaming, nor was there any slowdown in the camera app.
The A13 chip inside the iPhone 11 is a beast
The iPhone 11 has some fancy new audio tricks, designed to try and make the noise coming from the phone feel a bit less like it’s just coming from either end and more like it’s coming from all around the device. The ‘spatial’ audio supports common formats like Dolby 5.1 (if you’re watching from Netflix) and Atmos (iTunes) and while it’s a nice improvement over the XR it’s far from true ‘surround sound’.
Apple also said the FaceID sensor that unlocks the phone is faster this time and works at more acute angles. Speed has never been an issue for FaceID and it remains snappy, though judging it next to an iPhone XS Max doesn’t show a huge increase in speeds. In terms of the angles it can work at, I still have to pick it up from a table to get it to register, so the improvements there feel minimal.
The final piece of the performance jigsaw is a completely new U1 chip. The uses of this seem a little sparse currently, however it does make AirDropping files to other U1 and iOS 13.1 users easier
There’s no 5G support on any of the new iPhones and there’s no dedicated 5G handset from Apple this year. This was heavily rumoured in the run-up to launch and hardly comes as a surprise.
Pick the cheapest iPhone 11 and you’ll get 64GB storage, four times less than the 256GB base Galaxy Note 10. If you plan on storing lots of 4K60 video, multiple Apple Arcade games (these seems to be usually about 1GB each) and music, then that will quickly fill up. For an extra £50/$50 you get the 128GB model which represents much better value. There’s a 256GB option, too.
iOS 13 – iPhone 11 brings Dark mode and more
iOS 13 isn’t exclusive to the iPhone 11 and if you’ve already got an iPhone from the past few years then you’ll be able to upgrade that to benefit from a number of the new features. Still, the latest iOS updates always seem to perform best on the newest hardware.
In terms of features, iOS 13 is far from a complete rethinking of the platform, but that’s not to say there aren’t a few choice bits here to get excited about.
Apple Arcade pretty much came out of nowhere for me. I had almost no hype or anticipation for Apple’s all-you-can-eat gaming service – and then I started playing some of the games. For £4.99 ($4.99) you get unlimited, completely offline access to 60ish games (there’s more to come) all of which are subscription exclusive to Arcade and, from the ones I have played, some are very impressive. 
Oceanhorn 2 is a lovely-looking Zelda-alike that feels likes it’s pushing the A13 Bionic chip; Sayonara Wild Hearts is a gorgeous rhythm game and Assemble With Care is a therapeutic building game. Not only are the games a great way to try out a new phone, but they’re also presented in a slick dedicated portion of the App Store that’s easy to navigate around.
Dark Mode is another new addition and probably the one feature most have been requesting. Flip on this new mode and most of the light UI elements will change to blacks and dark greys. This works across Apple’s native apps – Maps, iMessage, Mail and News to name but a few – and third-party apps can integrate their own dark modes with the system-wide one too.
Related: How to turn on Dark Mode in iOS 13
I do think Dark Mode looks a lot better on the OLED-toting iPhone 11 Pro – as these display types can turn individual pixels off to produce perfect black colours. Blacks on the iPhone 11 can look a bit washed out and not as appealing in comparison.
iOS 13 also brings big updates to the Maps apps. There are now 3D views of cities and you can build collections of your favourite places. Photos has an updated look too, complete with surprisingly excellent editing tools.
iOS now has dark mode
The biggest tick against iOS 13 so far is that it’s a little bit buggy. I have noticed frequent app crashes, force restarts and bouts of unresponsiveness that weren’t there at all in iOS 12.  These have diminished somewhat thanks to an absolute load of iOS updates since the iPhone 11 was released, though. My review unit is now on iOS 13.2.3 and most of my initial issues have been solved – these notably include the lack of reliable search function and odd app behaviour. Still, things do feel less stable than iOS 12.
Should I buy the iPhone 11?
The iPhone XR was one of Apple’s most popular phones and I can’t see any reason why the iPhone 11 won’t be just as successful. 
Apple has seen what most people want and instead of making this seem like a cheaper version of the true flagship it has given it the full iPhone 11 name.

Related: iPhone 11 vs iPhone 11 Pro
Related: iPhone 11 vs iPhone XR

Unless you’re a complete sucker for an OLED display, or particularly want the zoomed telephoto lens, then there isn’t much you’re missing out on by not getting the Pro model. Especially when you consider the over £300/$300 saving you’re making by going for this version.
If you’re coming from an iPhone XR you might want to wait a year and see what the 2020 iPhone brings. However, if you’re updating an older iPhone then you’ll notice the vast array of improvements to camera, battery life and overall design straight away.
I also have to applaud Apple for keeping the price on the more ‘affordable’ side of things. At £729/$699 this is a great buy that’ll hopefully comfortably perform for a number of years.
Verdict
A great phone, the iPhone 11 is the default Apple flagship for the next year and it’s worthy of that crown. An excellent camera and strong battery life make this is an easy choice.

Verdict





























 



A year on and the Pixel 3 is still a great phone. However, that's mostly down to the photos. The poor amount of RAM has reared its head and with the Pixel 3a offering just about the same camera skills in a much cheaper phone it's a hard sell.

We're also eagerly awaiting the Pixel 4, which looks set to pack an extra camera on the back, smoother display and plenty of new shooting modes.

Still, if you can find it for a good price we're happy to continue recommending the Pixel 3 for its camera and low-light shooting alone.



Pros

Great haptics
Google’s Android is the best Android
Much-improved design
Breathtaking camera both on the front and back
Fast wireless charging and clever Pixel Stand (even if it’s not included)



Cons

No form of facial unlocking
Can scratch easily

What is the Google Pixel 3?


Google has just announced the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. For an in-depth look at both phones take a look at our Pixel 4 review: hands on and Pixel 4 XL review: hands on.
We’re in the midst of reviewing the Pixel 4 devices, but for now continue reading for our Pixel 3 review.
Google Pixel 3 design – Much improved and a great small phone


Previous Pixel devices haven’t been great lookers. They’ve been functional rather than fashionable; durable rather than delicate. The Google Pixel 3 is the first entry that feels like a match for big boys like the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.
From a distance, and especially in pictures, the Pixel 3 looks just like the Pixel 2. Pick it up, hold it and then you’ll notice the difference.

The back is smooth, constructed completely out of glass and almost soft to the touch. It has the finish of a heavily polished pebble and slips comfortably into your palm. Instead of just putting glass on the back and stopping there, Google has split the look of the glass: the top portion is shiny, with the lower area matte.
I love the matte finish here – it’s most noticeable on the white and pink versions – as it reduces smudges and adds some of the grip often lost when glass is switched to metal. It does make the device scratch very easily though.
This is still a slippery phone, especially if you’re coming from a Pixel or Pixel 2, and being glass means it is less resistant to drops. Switching to glass also allows Google to introduce wireless Qi charging and it helps retain the IP68 water-resistance rating.
Related: Best Android phones
A USB-C port is the only connection here – there’s no 3.5mm headphone jack – and that’s flanked by a SIM card tray. Along the right hand side there’s a clicky volume rocker and power button that, on my white version, has a contrasting mint colour.

Having all the buttons on one side isn’t for me and I much prefer having the lock switch on its own as it means you don’t accidentally alter the volume when you want to turn the phone on.
Flip the phone over and you’ll notice the biggest difference between this and the Google Pixel 3 XL – the screen. Aside from being smaller (this has a 5.5-inch display, as opposed to a 6.3-inch one), the Pixel 3 doesn’t have the deep notch cutting into the display. Instead, it’s an 18:9 panel with a thinner border running around it than the Pixel 2. This makes it feel a lot more modern and so much better looking.
This isn’t a completely edge-to-edge display though, as two front-facing speakers sit above and below the display. You’ve also got dual selfie cameras too.

There’s a new Pixel in town: Read our comprehensive Google Pixel 3a review


A 5.5-inch screen might sound intimidating if you’re used to the older Pixels (both had 5-inch screens) or an iPhone (typically with a 4.7-inch screen) but thanks to the slimmer bezel the Pixel 3 is just about the same size overall as those two phones. It’s comfortable to use in one hand and small enough to slip into the pocket of tight jeans or a handbag. I’d say it’s the perfect size for a phone.
Google Pixel 3 Screen – No notch, not QHD+ resolution
At 5.5 inches, the screen on the Pixel 3 is the biggest of the non-XL Pixel phones. It’s also the best.

Colours are punchy and bright, with none of those murky whites that ruined the display on the Pixel 2 XL. 
Blacks are deep and inky too, thanks to the decision to stick with an OLED panel rather than an LCD one. OLED screen allows for pixels to be individually lit, meaning they can be turned off completely to display perfect blacks. 
It also means you won’t drain too much battery by using the always-on display.
Resolution of the panel is FHD+ (2160 x 1080), which might cause some concern for those wondering why it’s not been beefed up to Quad-HD+ (2960 x 1440) like the Samsung Galaxy S10 and LG G8. 
Honestly, at this size I struggle to decipher any difference between the two resolutions unless I get unnaturally close and really look for individual pixels. 

This is a perfectly crisp, detailed panel and one that wouldn’t be much better with a higher resolution.

Google has also added HDR support here, with compatible videos on YouTube looking truly stunning. There’s HDR support in Netflix too. 
Viewing angles are excellent and there’s enough oomph in brightness to see the screen outside. To my eye it’s not the brightest display around though, and you’ll probably find yourself manually altering the brightness levels a lot more than, say, with an iPhone.
Google is going for an accurate representation of colours of the screen of the Pixel 3 and there’s noticeably less saturation in reds and green than you’ll find in a Samsung phone. You can tweak the screen setting slightly with Boosted, Natural and Adaptive options available. Adaptive is the default and I haven’t felt the need to change it.
Google Pixel 3 performance – Satisfactory and nothing more
A very obvious theme ran throughout Google’s unveiling of the Pixel 3: specs were barely mentioned. Its thinking is that the software optimisation and how things work are far more important than flashy numbers and huge amounts of RAM.
If you are interested in the internals though, here’s a quick rundown: Snapdragon 845, 4GB RAM and 64GB of non-expandable storage with a 128GB model available for £100 extra. It feels a bit meagre in comparison to other 2019 phones.
The 4GB is the biggest issue with performance and I hope there’s at least 6GB in the Pixel 4.

This thing is fast, churning through everything I can throw at it without lagging or feeling bogged down. Games play smoothly and open as fast as any other Snapdragon 845 phone. It is, however, slower than the iPhone XS when opening the same game or app – but then comparing iPhones and Android phones is virtually impossible as there are so many different factors.
See the below charts for performance in synthetic benchmark tests.
Benchmark results in Geekbench 4
Scores from Antutu 7
Google Pixel 3 features – Audio and haptics are excellent
Audio: quality from the stereo front-facing speakers is truly excellent. As the sound is aimed towards you, it’s not blocked by hands when you’re watching a video and Google Assistant queries can easily be heard across a room. There’s no headphone jack here, but Google does include both a 3.5mm headphone jack adaptor and a pair of perfectly fine USB-C earbuds in the box.
These earbuds look a lot like the Pixel Buds from last year and they boast some of the same translation functions too. There’s Bluetooth 5 support too, if you’re more a fan of wireless headphones.
Haptics: a feature often forgotten about on Android phones is haptics: that vibration buzz you get when a message or call comes through. The vibration on the Pixel 2 was very weak and the one used here is a big improvement. Google seems to know this and as a result you’ll get a lot more small haptic responses throughout the OS. There’s one when you pull down the notification panel and another when you flick through apps.
Security: with lots of other phones switching to the face unlock systems, it seems a bit odd Google is holding steadfast with fingerprint authentication. The rear sensor is ridiculously fast and I would take this any day over an in-display option that doesn’t work to unlock apps, but some form of face unlock would have been nice. 
Google Pixel 3 Software – Android 10 is now here, bringing dark mode
The Google Pixel 3 runs Android 10 with the Pixel launcher on top, and it’s the best software experience on any Android phone. It’s certainly missing some features; a deep and customisable battery-saving mode being the most obvious to me, but the general experience is fantastic. Android 10 brings handy features like dark mode and new gestures for navigating around the UI. 
The UI is clean and simple; fast to navigate and never overbearing. There’s the essential Google apps pre-installed and absolutely nothing else. As a user of Google services, the way everything works and syncs together is nothing short of fantastic.
Google Photos remains the single best way to back up and store snaps, with the Pixel 3 offering unlimited full-resolution uploads to the cloud.
Pixel 3-specific features are kept to a minimum, and the majority of them are not yet available or restricted to the US. There’s a call-screening feature, for example, now available to certain people in the States, which will use Google’s Duplex AI to actually answer spam calls for you. I’ll be sure to try this out when it comes to the UK.

Verdict



































What is the iPhone 8?
The iPhone 8 is now available without a contract directly from Apple for £479. The phone has undergone many price-cuts since its original release in 2017 and it’s currently at its lowest price. You might be able to pick it up cheaper through other sellers or on contract.
Deal: Get the Apple iPhone 8 Refurbished SIM-free for just £189
While it’s cheaper than the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone XR, the iPhone 8 feels like a device from a bygone era. The chunky bezel, TouchID fingerprint sensor and very small display are a far cry from modern full-screen devices we’ve come to expect from both Apple and Android phone makers.
Still, the iPhone 8 is still getting updates – including the latest Dark Mode-infused iOS 13 – and takes good photos. It supports wireless charging and is a great buy if you’re keen on picking up the Apple Watch 5.

iPhone 8 Design – It now looks very dated
The iPhone 8 represents the most refined take on the design Apple first offered up with the iPhone 6, back in 2014. It’s a conventional candy bar touchscreen device with rounded corners and curved edges, although the materials at play here are a little different from that of its progenitor. More in line with most other flagship phones from the last couple of years, the iPhone 8 swaps a metal build for a glass-backed design, while a band of aluminium now runs the phone’s edge, where you’ll find the volume rocker, antennas and lock switch.
Moving to a glass back isn’t solely for aesthetics but it certainly doesn’t hurt them. For one the phone looks and feels more balanced, and although it adds a little weight, it also improves grip, which is no bad thing. The added grams are less welcome on the Plus model but here, it feels just right.
Related: Best smartphone

My one slight annoyance with the glass design is that it doesn’t quite blend into the aluminium rim as it did in previous models. There’s a notable lip between the end of the glass and the start of the metal, and my fingernail often gets caught in it. It’s a minor design quirk, however.
The obvious downside with glass is its fragility. The worry here is that a drop that wouldn’t have left any lasting damage on the iPhone 7 will leave the 8 with a seriously cracked rear. 
Related: Apple Watch 5 review
My overall view of the iPhone 8’s design is that it feels dull, predictable and quite some way behind Android flagships. At least Apple has ensured the iPhone 8 is still IP67-rated for water-resistance, a feature that’s fast-becoming a prerequisite on flagship phones. It also retains the exceptional Taptic engine that provides thoroughly satisfying nudges and buzzes throughout the operating system.

Apple’s handsets remain my preferred choice when it comes to the colourways available. There are three colour options for the iPhone 8 – not the five of the iPhone 11 or XR – but the gold is easily my favourite. This replaces the former gold option and Rose Gold; it’s an amalgamation of both. The glass on the rear of the device possesses a soft, almost ‘creamy’ quality, while the sides are a less vivid pink. It’s appealing, but not all in the Trusted Reviews’ office share this view. If gold isn’t your thing then the iPhone 8 is available in Space Grey and silver too.
It’s been a years since Apple killed the headphone jack, and to absolutely no-one’s surprise, it hasn’t made a return here.

iPhone 8 Screen – Small, yet still sharp
At 4.7-inches, with a barely over-720p resolution, the display on the iPhone 8 doesn’t whip up much excitement. However, there is actually plenty to like here, and the few changes Apple has made do make a noticeable difference in use.
The main upgrade is True Tone, which first debuted on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. It’s a clever feature that dynamically alters the display’s white balance depending on the environment you’re in. It’s like the Night Shift mode in iOS, but on a hardware level. It sounds minimal, but it really does work to soften the blue tones in the display, with the end result making it more comfortable on the eyes.
Apple is also now supporting the Dolby Vision and HDR10 formats, so you can play back HDR movies from iTunes and supported content from Netflix. Unlike the iPhone X, which Apple claims has a ‘True HDR’ screen, the iPhone 8 doesn’t. Still, watching Mad Max in HDR does look noticeably better than on the iPhone 7.

The rest of the display specs remain the same as before. It’s still an IPS LCD panel; if you want the perfect blacks and more vivid colours of OLED, you’ll have to plump for an iPhone X, iPhone XS, XS Max or an Android device.
Related: iPhone XR vs iPhone 11
The resolution can make photos look slightly grainy but it remains one of my favourite displays for colour reproduction, and the support for the DCI-P3 wide colour gamut makes a huge difference in supported content. It also excels for use in super-sunny conditions – an area in which OLEDs often suffer.
iPhone 8 Performance – Powered by the A11 Bionic
Both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus run the same A11 Bionic chip, and so does the iPhone X. The difference is in the RAM offering: the iPhone 8 has only 2GB of RAM and the 8 Plus and the X have 3GB of RAM.
Is the lack of a gigabyte evident? Not that I’ve noticed. The iPhone 8 is just as competent at holding apps in memory as the 8 Plus, and it feels as though the extra memory is mainly present for the intensive camera modes.

The A11 Bionic is a six-core processor, with two high-power and four low-power cores that churn through absolutely anything with ease. In benchmarks, it picked up a score of 9037 in the multi-core Geekbench 4 test, which comfortably beats off any of the 2017 Android competition.
Related: Best iPhone Deals
I do wish that with all this power at their disposal, app developers would do more to make the most of it all. A big push with iPhone 8 and, specifically, iOS 11 is augmented reality (AR), which layers graphical elements over the real world. There are already a few apps that use this feature – the IKEA app lets you place furniture around the home, for example – but they all appear to run just as well on an iPhone 6S as they do on the iPhone 8. 
The same is true of games; I can’t find anything that performs notably better on the iPhone 8 than the iPhone 7. This isn’t really Apple’s fault, but it does mean that the performance boost is quite hard to utilise. 
More noticeable are the improved front-facing stereo speakers. Apple says these are ‘25% louder than the iPhone 7’, and whether or not these numbers are accurate, they do sound very good indeed. Call quality, too, is excellent, as is cellular and Wi-Fi reception.
iPhone 8 Software – You can now install iOS 13
If you buy the iPhone 8 it’ll come with iOS 13 installed or you’ll be able to easily upgrade the software on the phone to the latest version. It also seems safe to say Apple will allow you to install iOS 14 next year, though of course, this is far from being confirmed yet.
iOS 13 is a nice upgrade, bringing with it some handy features like audio sharing through multiple pairs of AirPods, UI tweaks to make it less distracting when you’re altering the volume and a much more powerful version of Apple Maps.

The biggest update though is the addition of Dark Mode. Enable this and the whole UI will turn from white to grey, making it much easier on the eyes.
Camera
iPhone 8 Camera – 12-megapixels with an f/1.8 aperture
The iPhone 8 has with numerous minor improvements if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 7; be it the screen, processor or battery life. But the one area where it feels like there’s been a dramatic step forward is the camera.
Related: Best camera phones

Photos taken with the iPhone 8 look great. Colours are punchy, detail is good and there’s a lot more saturation and definition between colours than seen on previous iPhones. This deep saturation trick is used a lot by Samsung, and it feels like Apple is following suit. The pictures taken with an iPhone 8 are still more natural-looking than Samsung’s flagship, but the difference isn’t what it was.
Apple says it has completely rebuilt the sensor this time around, adding in ‘deeper pixels’ and a brand-new image signal processor. This may sound like marketing fluff, but in reality I’ve been more impressed with the pictures on the iPhone 8 than any iPhone in recent years.
Related: Best smartphone
Even though it’s still a 12-megapixel sensor, there’s heaps on detail
Exposure is balanced well thanks to the auto-HDR mode
Colours look great
You can focus accurately even up close
It does well in low-light, but there isn’t a huge improvement over the iPhone 7 here
 
Landscape pictures look great
The now permanently on auto-HDR mode – it can be switched off, but you’ll have to dig in Settings to do so – does a fantastic job of levelling out exposure. This means photos taken on the iPhone 8 won’t be overblown in the lighter portions, instead displaying much better balance. Auto-HDR is particularly helpful for landscape photos, where the sky can tend to lose all colour if you’re not careful, but it removes the risk of pictures looking unnatural and artificial by using it only sparingly.
When the light isn’t great, the iPhone 8’s focusing slows down significantly, with noise more common than some of the competition. Again, it’s a close race and it is possible to achieve some excellent shots even when it’s dark – but the results are pretty similar to those of the iPhone 7. I’d have liked to see Apple widen the aperture, which would have enabled more light to reach the sensor, resulting in brighter shots. 
Where the iPhone 8 seems to impress the most is in textures. The way it captures the tiny scrapes in metal, dust on bricks and individual hairs on a head is fantastic. The iPhone 8 is also the device that’s best at taking pics with the flash on – an odd claim to make, maybe, but the softer, more diffused flash used here means it doesn’t completely blow out faces.
Being able to shoot more frames per second gives footage a smoother look and is especially great for shooting motion, such as sports. Dialling it back to 24fps achieves a more cinematic feel. Note that you do notice the lack of OIS on the secondary camera when recording at 60fps. I also still believe that the Google Pixel 2 does a better job of stabilising video overall than the iPhone 8.
Another first, for a phone at least, is slow-motion recording at 240fps in 1080p. Previously, this was available at 720p, but now it looks sharper and there’s more scope for zooming.
The front-facing camera is still 8 megapixels and it’s actually one of the better ones around. Skin tones look natural and there’s plenty of detail. It’s biggest downside is the lens’ narrow field of view, meaning you have hold the phone much further away to cram in lots of faces.
Battery
iPhone 8 Battery life – How long does it last?
When Trusted Reviews reviewed the iPhone 7, Evan Kypreos found the poor battery life to be the single biggest reason to avoid the device. He claimed it had ‘the shortest battery life he’d experienced on any mainstream phone over the past couple of years’ – and that he was often reaching for a Lightning cable before the end of the day.
Considering the iPhone 8 has a smaller battery than the iPhone 7, and the fact that Apple made no claims about stamina during its unveiling, I was hugely sceptical about the iPhone 8’s battery life.
Related: Best iPhone Deals
But it’s absolutely fine, and pretty much what I’d expect from a device of this size. This isn’t a phone that will see you through a day of constant, heavy use, but Apple’s strong standby times mean it barely drops juice at all when you’re not actively using it, and I wasn’t left reaching for the Lightning cable by 6pm.
The iPhone 8 manages to last the day, although I say that with some caveats. I’ve felt as though I’ve had to ‘babysit’ the battery to a greater extent than I have with the iPhone 8 Plus. I switch off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when I’m not using it and I lower the brightness far more; my eyes are constantly drawn to the dropping percentage indicator. It isn’t the battery life that will impress folk, but it also isn’t quite as frustrating as last year.
I ran a few basic side-by-sides tests with an iPhone 7 and iPhone 6S, and the iPhone 8 came out on top in all them. An hour of Netflix (Wi-Fi, 60% brightness, sound 50%) consumed 11% on the 8, 14% on the 7 and 13% on the 6S. Thirty minutes of Real Racing 3 ate through 12% on the 8, 16% on the 7 and 15% on the 6S. Obviously, batteries get worse over time and the 6S used here has been constantly worn down over more than 12 months, so that will affect its score.
The iPhone 8 still charges via a Lightning cable and you get the same 5W plug in the box. Unlike pretty much every Android out there, there’s no out-of-the-box fast-charging here. Apple claims the iPhone 8 supports faster charging, but it’s still one of slower phones to charge.
iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus
The included wall plug will get you from 0-80% in about 60 minutes, and you can shave 10 minutes off that by using an iPad charger. I also tried charging it with the USB-C plug that comes with the MacBook Pro plus a USB-C-to-Lightning cable – this got me from 0-80% in 45 minutes. It then took a further 35 minutes to reach 100%.
If you want to ditch the Lightning cable completely, the iPhone 8 supports Qi wireless charging through the Qi standard. This is the same method that Android phones have used to charge wirelessly for years. Wireless charging is about as slow as using the included wall plug, but there will be an update later in the year that will unlock slightly faster 7.5W wireless charging in supported pads.
Should I buy the iPhone 8?
The iPhone 8 is a good phone – very good in certain respects – but it also feels like it was the forgotten child.

Verdict





























 



Once the best iPhone I had ever used and one of the most exciting phones of its time, the iPhone X still resembles the turning point for Apple's design. Even the phones that have come out these years are still packing the same design. 



Pros

Stunning screen
Much-improved telephoto camera
The best-looking iPhone ever
Impressive battery life
Face ID is so much better than a fingerprint sensor



Cons

Software needs more optimisation for the taller display and notch
No fast-charging plug included
Very expensive






Key Specifications

Review Price: £999
5.8-inch OLED HDR display
A11 Bionic CPU
64GB or 256GB storage
Face ID
Dual 12-megapixel camera with OIS
IP67
Animoji




The iPhone X isn’t sold officially by Apple anymore, having been replaced first by the iPhone XS then the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and now iPhone 12.
If you pick up the iPhone X now you’ll still be getting a great buy. It has just been updated to iOS 14 so you’ll be able to get access to new features like Dark Mode, a much better Apple Maps app and much more.
The iPhone X remains a strong buy in other areas too. It looks very similar to the latest iPhone 11 Pro, has a great screen (that supports HDR in iTunes and Netflix) and a camera that still stands up there with the better ones you can buy. If you want a slightly bigger device that might even come in cheaper than the iPhone X it might be worth looking at the iPhone XR which has just received a significant price drop.
if you want to know more about the iPhone X you can read our original review below.
iPhone X Design – This phone reignited Apple’s phone design skills
Apple has been coasting for too long with the design it introduced for the iPhone 6, but that all changes with the iPhone X – in a big way. You don’t need me to tell you the iPhone X is a huge departure from the iPhone design of old – just look at the pictures. Not only does it look good, however; Apple has done a fantastic job at actually making it feel really good too.
Related: OnePlus 7T review
This phone is simply gorgeous. It’s slightly taller than the iPhone 8 (and 7 and 6) but much narrower and smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus. It strikes the perfect balance, especially since you’re getting a 5.8-inch display here.

The aluminium sides have been swapped out for stainless steel – as seen on the Apple Watch – and the front and rear of the device are glass. I received the Silver variant for review – and, unfortunately, it wasn’t long before it was covered in fingerprints, those shiny sides being a particular magnet. This is a phone that looks fantastic straight after a wipe-down; not so much a few hours after it’s been in your greasy palms.
Also of concern is how the iPhone X will fare over time. No matter how unscientific they might be, drop tests indicate that the finish here doesn’t lend itself well to wear and tear. After all, the stainless steel Apple Watch I’ve been using is a scratched-up mess. As a result, my iPhone X has spent much of its time inside an Apple case, but this certainly sees it lose points in the glamour stakes.
It’s around the front of the iPhone X that the magic happens, though. The iPhone 8 has an extensive bezel running around the display, but the iPhone X doesn’t. The lack of a thick bezel means there’s no room for the Home button, a feature present on every single iPhone iteration until now. As a result, there’s no Touch ID fingerprint scanner. Instead, the iPhone X sees Apple introduce facial recognition – a bold move.
All of the components for Face ID (infrared camera, flood illuminator, dot projector) are housed in what’s affectionately being called the ‘notch’. You’ll find the notch at the top of the display, where it somewhat disrupts that all-screen look. There’s been much controversy concerning the notch with regards to it completely ruining the immersive experience. Once you begin using the phone, however, I’ve found that it simply blends into the background. 
Sure, you notice it when the screen is on, plus it juts into video if you’re playing something full-screen. But in all other instances it fades into the background. Certain apps – Apple’s Music being one – use software trickery to blank out the notch, and some apps clearly need to be updated to ensure important buttons aren’t hidden by it.

In the space either side of the notch you’ll find the battery indicator and time. Annoyingly, you can no longer see the battery percentage remaining or whether you have a pair headphones connected without opening the Control Center. The bigger annoyance is that the battery and signal indicators aren’t in line with the bottom of the notch, so they dip slightly below and look rather weird.
I do feel that the notch gives the iPhone X a bit of character and a distinctive look, something lost by the dismissal of the Home button. I’m sure Apple would get rid of it in an instant if it could cram this tech inside the bezel; but it does feel as though the company wants to use it as a distinguishing feature while it’s here.

iPhone X Face ID – How Apple replaced the iconic Touch ID
I’ve used Samsung’s face unlock and iris scanners a fair bit, and have never been particularly impressed by either their speed or accuracy. So it was important that Apple’s Face ID worked every single time.
It works accurately in both the light and dark; it can’t be fooled by pictures or masks; and it works if you’re wearing glasses too. There have been reports that twins have fooled it, and Apple told me some IR-blocking sunnies won’t work, but these are limited scenarios. Note that you need to be ‘actively aware’ for it to work – you can’t just shove it in someone’s face and expect it to unlock.
The ‘notch’ is where all the Face ID bits are housed
Face ID isn’t perfect, though, but then neither was Touch ID; the fingerprint scanner was poor if your fingers were slightly greasy or wet. This isn’t a problem now. However, I have found that Face ID struggles if my eyes are a shrivelled mess, usually first thing in the morning, and if the phone isn’t close enough to my face. If you’re the type of person who tries to sneak a look at their notifications with your phone at pocket-level then you’re out of luck.
Apps that previously used Touch ID as a means of unlocking will automatically be replaced by Face ID without the need for an update, and you can of course use it for Apple Pay payments too.
iPhone X Screen – Nearly the same you’ll find on the iPhone 11 
The iPhone X sees Apple switch out its usual LCD screen tech for an OLED panel for the first time. Samsung, Google and many other Android phone makers have been using this technology for some time now, and it’s nice to see Apple finally joining the fray with a product other than the Apple Watch. This is also the highest-resolution screen ever on an iPhone, with a slightly odd 2436 x 1125 pixels, plus there’s support for the DCI P3 colour gamut and Dolby Vision HDR.
Apple’s OLEDs come from Samsung, and while there’s a small shift to blue if you tilt the device off-axis, it’s far less noticeable than on the Pixel 2 XL. Apple says it’s made a fair few tweaks to this panel, and the company’s optimisation of it is certainly different to Samsung’s approach for its own Galaxy S9 and Note 8 panels. Colours on the iPhone X are more natural and the saturation isn’t quite so intense.

The iPhone X’s screen also benefits from True Tone, which alters the screen temperature depending on the environment you’re in. 3D Touch makes a return, too, allowing you to perform alternative actions on applying different levels of pressure on the screen.
Whether or not you’re a fan of the iPhone X’s display will come down to what features you value most in a screen. For me, this is the best screen on any handset I’ve seen. I downloaded a few HDR-enabled movies from iTunes – something you can’t do on Android – and they’re stunning. I wouldn’t normally watch an entire film on a sub 6-inch screen, but on the iPhone X I did – and I wasn’t distracted by the notch at all.

Verdict





























 



The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is easily the most feature-packed phones, even nearly a year after it was announced. It has a fantastic camera, superb screen, competition-beating battery life and plenty of additional tricks alongside.

If it wasn’t for Huawei’s slightly janky software and some mild complaints about the curvature of the display, this would be the most complete Android phone I’ve ever reviewed.



Pros

Great display
Very fast charging
Plenty of clever tricks such as in-display fingerprint and reverse wireless charging
Battery life is fantastic



Cons

Huawei’s software remains a weakness

What is Huawei Mate 20 Pro?
The Huawei Mate 30 Pro might have just seen its official announcement, however we still don’t know when it’ll get a release in the UK. There’s also the big issue of the lack of Google apps (even if it is fairly easy to install Google apps on the Mate 30 Pro) due to the ongoing Android ban.
Those issues don’t affect the Mate 20 Pro, though. Pick up this phone today and you’ll have access to Gmail, YouTube and the full delights offered by the Play Store.
It is also still receiving updates from Google and Huawei has said Android 10 with EMUI 10 will be coming. In many ways the Mate 20 Pro might be a better buy than the Mate 30 Pro.
Related: Huawei Mate 30
Editors Note: Due to the recent retraction of Huawei’s Android license, future Huawei and Honor phones won’t be able to access Google Play Services and as a result many Android apps including YouTube and Gmail. Both Huawei and Google have confirmed Huawei and Honor phones, like the one in this review, will continue to have access for this time being. Until we know more about the situation we’re leaving the scores on all our Huawei reviews, however as the situation changes we’ll revisit this.

Huawei Mate 20 Pro Design – This remains a gorgeous phone
In just a few years Huawei has gone from shipping phones that feel like knock-offs of other flagships to creating some of the slickest devices around.
The Mate 20 Pro is Huawei’s best-looking phone – even when compared to the newer P30 Pro. While it certainly takes inspiration from the curvature of Samsung’s Galaxy S-series, it showcases enough individuality to make it stand out – and, personally, I’d put it right up there with the best-designed phones around.
Huawei has done an exceptional job of making a phone with a 6.39-inch display feel far smaller than it should. This is in part the result of the stretched-out screen, which now pushes almost to the edge – aside from the requisite notch, of course – and also due to the heavy reliance on curves. 
Related: Best Android phones

Huawei is a fan of experimenting with colours and so the Mate 20 Pro is available in a wide range of hues. My review unit has a dark green back that not only looks great, but has some added texture as a result of raised lines running from one side to the other. These are almost impossible to see in pictures, but scratch your fingers across the surface and it sounds like a vinyl record.
Oddly, this textured rear is only available on the green and blue options, with the other colours – including the trippy Twilight finish made famous by the Huawei P20 Pro – coming with a more conventional, smooth back. Even though the Mate 20 Pro isn’t the biggest phone around, it still feels far more comfortable in this added texture.
Around the sides of the phone sits both the power button and volume rocker along one edge, with the other completely free of buttons. Personally, I prefer the lock button to be located on the opposite side to the volume buttons since it reduces the chance of accidental presses.
Related: Samsung Galaxy S10
USB-C is the only port on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro; there’s no headphone jack here. There is, however, an IR blaster on the top for controlling a TV, for example.
Like the 3.5mm jack, the physical fingerprint sensor has been ditched. Now, unlike Apple, Huawei isn’t forcing you into solely using face unlock. Instead, it has placed a fingerprint scanner beneath the phone’s OLED display. Aside from feeling ridiculously futuristic, this method of unlocking allows for a cleaner-looking device.

Alongside the in-display fingerprint sensor is a face-unlocking system reminiscent of the one seen in the iPhone series. Instead of simply using the front camera to determine it’s you, the Mate 20 Pro builds a depth map of your face using an IR emitter, dot projector and the 24-megapixel camera. 
This system is far more secure than simpler solutions, and as such can be used to unlock banking and other apps that usually require fingerprint authentication. It also works very well in the dark, without forcing the screen to light up and blind your tired eyes.
Huawei Mate 20 Pro Screen – Curved OLED panel looks great
Another winning aspect of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is its excellent 6.39-inch, 19.5:9 OLED screen. The panel is rounded at the corners, curved at the sides and packs a sharp 3120 x 1440 resolution.
There’s very little to criticise here, but I’ll begin with my only negative point: I don’t really like the curved edges. Sloping the screen down over the phone’s edges was first popularised by Samsung with its Edge series, and then more recently with its Galaxy flagships.
As Samsung has refined its design, the sides have gradually become less sloped, to the point where on the Galaxy Note 9 they’re barely there. With the Mate 20 Pro, the sides feel too curved and have a sharp finish.
You’ll also notice that they catch far more light than the flat portion of the screen, reflecting quite heavily in bright environments.
Look past these issues, however, and the Mate 20 Pro’s panel is up there with the best displays on the market. OLED presents deep blacks and infinite contrast, while Huawei has kept the colours fairly natural: reds have a nice burst of vibrancy without feeling oversaturated, and greens don’t end up appearing luminous.

There are also lots of options for tweaking the colour performance, making it cooler, warmer or enabling ‘Vivid’ mode to boost saturation. High Dynamic Range (HDR) video support is here, too; however, Netflix or Amazon Prime don’t currently support the Mate 20 Pro’s display specifically. HDR videos on YouTube look exceptional, though.
Sitting at the top of the display is a notch – the small cutout that hides all the sensors required for the biometric face-unlock feature. Notches tend not to bother me in the slightest, especially when they’re hiding advanced tech. 
The notch on the Pro isn’t one that simply mimics the unit on the iPhone. Here it houses a multitude of sensors and ensures the screen can be pushed out as far as possible.
Huawei Mate 20 Pro Performance – Still very fast
The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is powered by the Kirin 980 – a chipset designed in-house by Huawei. Just like Apple and its A-series Bionic silicon, having the ability to build a chip yourself means you’re never waiting for the likes of Qualcomm to come out with its next iteration of the flagship Snapdragon chip.
The Kirin 980 is built using the 7nm architecture, which allows of smaller gaps between the transistors on each chip. A smaller distance leads to improved performance and, more importantly, better efficiency. 
The chip here remains an eight-core unit, like the previous Kirin 970. However, it now uses four low-powered, two medium, and two high-powered cores – each responsible for specific tasks.
Geekbench 4 scores

This is also likely down to the 6GB of RAM. Huawei also said the Mate 20 Pro will continue to be fast 12 to 18 months down the line, which is far more important than how quick it feels after having just bought the device.
Taking care of the graphics is the Mali G76 MP10 and, once again, this phone is an absolute beast when it comes to gaming. There might be dedicated gaming phones out there but the Huawei Mate 20 Pro should be taken very seriously if you’re into mobile gaming.
Intensive titles such as Asphalt 9 launched noticeably faster than on the competition, and I found myself in a race consistently quicker than with a Pixel 3 or the Samsung Galaxy S10.
Huawei’s phones have always impressed with strong reception for both Wi-Fi and cellular data, and that remains the case here. Phone calls sound clear, and since the phone supports dual-SIM, you can place two nano-SIMs inside.
Interestingly, there’s no microSD support here. Instead, Huawei has developed a new expandable storage card called Nano Memory. As the name implies, this card is the same size as a nano-SIM, and fits in the same slot. At the time of review, I couldn’t find any nano memory cards for sale. The lack of microSD support is softened by the 128GB of internal storage, though.
To offset the missing 3.5mm headphone jack Huawei includes both a dongle for connecting wired headphones along with a serviceable pair of USB-C earbuds in the box. There’s also a decent speaker setup here, with noise coming both from the notch and the bottom of the device.
Related: 5G in the UK
Huawei Mate 20 Pro Software – You’ll still get Google apps and updates here
There’s so much to like about the Huawei Mate 20 Pro – but, sadly, the software experience still needs work.
Huawei’s intrusive EMUI, which runs on Android 9 Pie, remains a strange combination of Google’s software and knock-off iOS. It ditches the app drawer for an iOS-like appearance of multiple homescreens crammed with apps, not to mention it comes with an excess of bloatware. Everything about EMUI continues to feel a bit all over the place. The icons are blocky and ugly, notifications often miss out important information, and the Settings menu is a mess of hard-to-find options.
Problems aren’t confined to the UX design, either; EMUI seems to actively limit functionality. You can’t interact with and act upon notifications on the lock-screen, and I had continual issues with Google services refusing to sync properly and reliably.

Huawei has also taken two of Pie’s biggest features and tweaked them. Digital Wellbeing is now Digital Balance, and this lets you set timers for apps, keep an eye on how much time you’re spending on your phone per day, and dim the colours at night. 
Navigation gestures are here, working more like iOS than Android as you’d find on a Pixel 3. I like being able to swipe from an app to go home but Huawei’s implementation of going back needs work: you need to swipe on the left side of the display, but the phone just doesn’t do a good job at recognising this gesture, an issue that gave me flashbacks to early iterations of the company’s Knuckle Mode *shudder*.
Huawei has said it is updating the Mate 20 Pro to EMUI 10 (which is built upon Android) and you’ll of course still be able to access Google apps here even with the Android ban.

Verdict


































The OnePlus 7T is actually a small update to the OnePlus 7 that launched earlier this year. It aims to offer buyers a number of subtle, but important hardware improvements on its predecessor.
Highlights include an upgraded Fluid AMOLED display, more powerful CPU, better fast charging and a new triple-sensor rear camera.
The upgrades don’t sound like much, but they add up to make the OnePlus 7T feel like a significant improvement on the original OnePlus 7. With pricing starting at £549 it’s also great value for money. Make no mistake the OnePlus 7T easily competes with top end blowers, like the Huawei P30 and Asus Zenfone 6 and is currently one of the best mid-range phones on the market.
Read our reviews of the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro

Design and Screen

90Hz display enables smooth scrolling
No waterproofing

Out of the box you’ll struggle to tell the OnePlus 7T from the regular OnePlus 7. It has the same OnePlus 6T inspired mixed metal and glass design, which is no bad thing. The design may not have the nifty pop-up front camera setup seen on the OnePlus 7 Pro (read our OnePlus 7T Pro review), but it still looks great and comes with a wealth of handy features.
Up front you’ll see a cool Huawei P30-style dew drop notch front camera housing. Under the display there’s also an in-screen fingerprint scanner, which works a treat, though I used the face unlock feature for most of my review. On the side there’s also a nifty quick switch that lets you switch between noise, vibrate and silent profiles on the fly.
The design looks and feels as good as it did on the OnePlus 7 and 6T and overall I have no complaints about it. The only thing I’d say is that like all glass backed phones, you’ll want to invest in a case as it won’t survive any accidental fumbles completely unscathed.
The lack of an IP water resistance rating is also a common and recurring issue with OnePlus phones, which means you’ll want to avoid the 7T having any aquatic adventures.
Under the hood things have been given more of a spruce. The biggest is the addition of the “Fluid AMOLED” screen tech seen on the OnePlus 7 Pro. Fluid AMOLED is marketing-speak for the fact the 6.55-inch AMOLED screen has a 90Hz refresh rate. Like every phone I’ve tested with a higher than 60Hz refresh rate, this is a key selling point for the 7T.
The higher refresh rate makes little things like scrolling through menus feel significantly smoother and can give you a competitive edge in competitive games, like PUBG and MOBAs. This is because by displaying more images per second, there are fewer gaps between you enacting commands and them being rendered on-screen. Most of the best phones and especially the best Android phone utilise this feature now.

The screen retains the same 2400 x 1080 resolution as the OnePlus 7, which is a slight shame, but it’s hard to hold it against the 7T given how well it performs in other areas. The screen’s 1000 nits max brightness makes it HDR ready and ensures it remains usable in everything but direct sunlight. The AMOLED panel also ensures blacks are uniformly deep, giving movies and games a wonderfully immersive feel. Colours look a little overcooked in the default Vivid setting, but it’s quick and easy to fix this in the settings.
OnePlus has also bumped the CPU up to Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 855 Plus CPU, which should offer a moderate gaming performance boost – though if we’re honest, the regular 7 is still more than powerful enough, so you probably won’t notice the difference 99% of the time.
Camera

Main 48MP Sony sensor
This is paired with telephoto and ultra wide cameras

The bigger change has happened round the back. Specifically, OnePlus has bumped the camera sensor count from two to three. But is now one of the best camera phones?
This means you get a triple sensor rear camera that combines the same 48-megapixel Sony sensor seen on the OnePlus 7 with a 12-megapixel telephoto and 16-megapixel ultrawide.
OnePlus has never been the best at camera tech, but I have to applaud the gradual progress its made improving it’s phones’ photography generation-to-generation. This remains the case with the OnePlus 7T which is another definite step in the right direction.
The triple sensor doesn’t match key, more expensive, rival phones such as the Huawei P30 Pro when it comes to image quality, but it’s more than good enough for most users.
The biggest improvements relate to how the camera performs in low light and when capturing macro shots.

The Nightscape mode comes installed out of the box. It lets the OnePlus 7T take noticeably better photos in low light than the original 7 did when it first launched. With a steady hand, photos taken in low light look clearer, are less noisy and generally more than good enough for Instagram.
OnePlus claims macro mode lets you shoot shots at distances of just 2.5cm. The feature works OK, and I could get usable shots at distances that rendered the Asus Zenfone 6 and Motorola One Vision’s cameras useless.
The triple sensor setup also lets you take wide angle shots, which is great for nature scenes and holiday photos.
The portrait mode is functional and good enough for social media. But if you blow up photos on a big screen you will notice blurred edges and a few anomalies.
Video recording is great thanks to the addition of optical image stabilisation (OIS) and electronic image stabilisation (EIS), though audio quality is an issue in windy areas.
My only real quibble with the OnePlus 7T’s camera is that, by default, it tries to force you to use OnePlus’ own gallery app. The app itself is fine, featuring decent auto-sort features, but I still prefer Google’s own.
This is representative of my feeling of OxygenOS 10 as a whole. While it doesn’t have much bloatware and the few features it adds are generally good, including intelligent swipe command shortcuts, I’d still have preferred a clean Android install.

Battery life – You’ll get solid battery life and upgraded fast charging

30w ‘Warp’ Charging gives you 70% charge in 30 minutes
3800mAh battery
No wireless charging

The addition of OnePlus new 30T Warp Charging tech is another key difference between the 7T and 7. The tech’s a modest upgrade on the regular 30 Warp Charge solution seen on the 7 that will reportedly let the phone go from 0 to 70% charge in 30 minutes.
Testing the charger, I found it wasn’t as big a step up on the rates we recorded on the OnePlus 7 as the company claimed, however, after half an hour at the mains I regularly had over 50-60% juice, but I never once got the quoted 70%.
Outside of this the OnePlus 7T’s battery is a modest update on the regular OnePlus 7’s. The OnePlus 7T’s 3800mAh battery isn’t as big as the 4000mAh cell seen in the OnePlus 7 Pro. But the phone offers solid battery life with regular use. Using the OnePlus 7T as my main blower, with the screen set to 90Hz, I generally got a day to a day and a half’s use out of it from a single charge.
Regular use entailed listening to music on my morning and evening commute, regularly checking incoming messages and social media feeds, taking and making a few calls and the odd PUBG or Netflix session before bed.
Gaming and video put a bigger drain on the battery, especially when using the phone in its 90Hz mode. Playing demanding 3D games with the screen at 150 nits – the level most people are comfortable – the phone lost an average of between 14-18% of its charge per hour, which is a bit more than I’d like. Video playback with same screen settings led to an average discharge rate of around 7-10% per hour. This again is good, but not best in class.

Should I buy the OnePlus 7T?
The OnePlus 7T is a great phone that fixes most of the niggling flaws we found with the OnePlus 7. The upgraded camera, Fluid AMOLED screen and improved fast charging all add up to make an already good Android phone great. If you’re on the market for a reasonably priced phone with flagship features, you’ll struggle to do better than it.
Verdict
The OnePlus 7T is an excellent bit of hardware. The Fluid AMOLED, 90Hz screen is industry leading and a key feature we’d like to see other mobile phone makers adopt. Add to this its improved fast charging, CPU and triple-sensor rear camera and the OnePlus 7T quickly becomes a pretty alluring bit of kit.

Verdict




























 



The Motorola One Zoom combines a great camera, screen and battery with a mid-range-specced phone. Its camera is loaded up with three focal lengths and manual controls, as well as a capable Night Vision mode. It easily makes it through a day and thanks to that screen, it shines brightly throughout. 

The Zoom isn’t a phone for anyone who needs maximum power for their buck – for this, a gaming phone like the Black Shark 2 would be ideal. Neither is it the best-looking phone for the price: that would be the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro. 



Pros

Almost a flagship camera
Clean, stable UI
Fantastic battery life



Cons

Less powerful than some competitors
Has a mono speaker
Good, but not great, design

What is the Moto One Zoom?
Mid-range phones are always a balancing act – what should manufacturers scrap to hit an affordable price? In the case of the Moto One Zoom, Motorola loaded it up with mid-range power, but virtually everything else about it is excellent on paper.
The One Zoom’s screen is an ample 6.4-inch OLED panel with Full HD+ resolution, similar to that of the OnePlus 7. There’s plenty of battery power – 4000mAh – and, with 128GB storage and support for a microSD card, you won’t be filling it up anytime soon.
The Zoom also has four cameras around the back, more than any other phone in its price range, and they’re well-specced too, with big pixel counts and optical image stabilisation – it’s looking good for Moto’s latest smartphone so far. 
Moto One Zoom Design – Premium, but what’s with the light-up bump?
The Motorola One Zoom looks and feels good, but not excellent, with a few design choices we don’t love – mainly concerning that bump on the back. 
It’s a well put-together device, with a metal frame; matte, rounded sides and corners; a frosted, brushed, curved glass back; and a big, bold OLED display with a respectable 85% screen-to-body ratio. 
That said, it also has what seems like the world’s biggest squircle of a camera bump on the back, which dominates the top half. In addition to housing four cameras, the bump also frames a Motorola logo which lights up. Unnecessary? Yes. Cool anyway? Not really, but that’s just my opinion.
Related: OnePlus 7T

Now that I’ve got my moaning out of the way, everything else about this phone’s design is pretty darn decent. 
At the bottom of the phone is a USB-C port and at the top is a loudspeaker and SIM tray, which takes two SIM cards, or one SIM card and one SD card. All the phone’s buttons – a power button and volume rocker – are on the right.
The matte finish on the back of the Motorola One Zoom means it doesn’t cling onto fingerprints as readily as phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10, and it also ships with a case in the box, just like the G7 Plus and G7 Power. 
One highlight which isn’t on too many sub-£400 phones is an under-display fingerprint scanner, as found on the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, and it works well. The Motorola One Zoom also unlocks with facial recognition. 
Motorola One Zoom Screen – A big bright OLED with a little inconspicuous notch
The Motorola One Zoom’s screen looks very good indeed with its Max Vision OLED tech with Full HD+ resolution of 2340 x 1080. At 6.4 inches, it’s also big enough to deliver an immersive screen experience without being unmanageable like the 7.2-inch Mate 20 X. 
With over 400 pixels-per-inch (ppi), while the Motorola One Zoom isn’t as sharp as QHD+ phones like the OnePlus 7 Pro, its resolution competes head-on with the likes of the Honor 20 and Honor 20 Pro, and beats out the much more expensive iPhone 11, which clocks in at 326ppi.
Viewing angles are very good, as is max brightness, but, with no HDR support, it doesn’t quite stack up on paper to the Mi 9T Pro. Still, gaming on its big display is as immersive as it needs to be for the price, and colour accuracy is reliable.
Dive into the settings, select Display, followed by Colors, and you can choose between three profiles – Natural, Boosted and Saturated – which is a nice bonus.

Motorola One Zoom Performance – Flagship performance across the board
Motorola is known for flooding the market with mid-rangers, so it’s little surprise that the Motorola One Zoom falls under that umbrella and isn’t a powerhouse, despite its flagship elements. While we found only occasional slow-down in the real world, benchmarks highlight the phone’s limitations more noticeably. 
With its Snapdragon 675 processor coupled with 4GB RAM, the phone betters its G7-series siblings, with the G7 Plus scoring just over half as well as the Zoom, but when stacked up against the Snapdragon 855-laden Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro, it scores a fair bit worse. That said, it does outperform the Google Pixel 3A – another mid-ranger that places its focus on delivering flagship imaging for a similar price – in certain benchmarks.

Keeping things simple, the Motorola One Zoom is available with one storage capacity version, 128GB, which is enough space for all but the most demanding file, app and game hoarders. Additionally, it can take microSD cards up to 512GB.
Motorola One Zoom Battery life – Turbo power all day and night
Motorola has thankfully loaded up its One Zoom with a big 4000mAh battery – a welcome bump up when compared to the 3500mAh Motorola One Action and One Vision.
The screen-on time is excellent, dropping by about 8% after an hour of streaming at full brightness, and even with gaming, hotspotting and a fair bit of photo taking, it still had plenty of power left in the tank after a full day. 
The Moto One Zoom doesn’t offer wireless charging, but it does charge relatively quickly: Turbo Charge at up to 15W powers it from 0-100% in under an hour and a half, and it ships with a charger in the box.
With Android 9’s Adaptive Battery feature, the phone also limits app battery usage intelligently to save juice, and there’s also a battery saver that limits background processes onboard too.
There’s a USB-C port on the bottom
Motorola One Zoom Software – Smooth, stock and simple
The Motorola One Zoom has a very stock Android 9 interface, with home screens, an apps drawer and a pull-down notifications bar, complete with quick toggles.
It’s unsurprisingly nice and smooth when swiping through, though frame rates aren’t as silky smooth as in phones with a bit more clout, like the Honor 20 or Mi 9T Pro. The Google feed screen is displayed to the left of the home screen and there’s minimal Motorola customisation beyond that found in the Moto app.
Here, you can control familiar Motorola gesture customisations, like firing up your phone’s flashlight with a karate chop or twisting your wrist to activate the camera. These have been around for years since the Moto X and are still an excellent addition to the Moto mix.
There’s also an almost always-on display that fires up when the phone detects movement nearby, or if you tap its screen. It shows previews of messages and alerts, and also enables an expanded peek at them, saving you having to unnecessarily unlock your phone. 
Moto’s version of Android is very clean
One thing I wish Motorola did adopt is standard Android 10 gestures, which are probably on their way in upcoming Moto phones running Google’s freshest mobile OS. Rather than edge-swipes taking you back and a swipe up from the bottom acting as the home button, the Motorola One family’s gesture input is limited to a slightly clunky pill in the bottom centre of the display. Alternatively, you can go old-school and opt for a traditional navigation bar.
Motorola One Zoom Camera: Quad-camera phone, dual-camera price
The Motorola One Zoom’s quad-camera has a similar set-up to that found on the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, with primary, telephoto, ultra-wide and depth-sensing cameras all interplaying to create one of the most versatile smartphone camera systems around. It gets you closer to the action for things like gigs or kids’ plays, and nice and wide for big all-encompassing landscapes.
The main camera is the 48MP (f/1.7) primary camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS) and phase detection autofocus (PDAF). The zoom, or telephoto component, comes in the form of an 8MP (f/2.4) which has a 3x optical zoom and OIS. The widest-angle camera, with an equivalent focal range of 13mm, is the 16MP (f/2.4), while the depth-sensing camera is 5MP, though doesn’t grab shots.
The primary sensor may be 48MP, but it snaps pictures at 12MP by default. This lower-resolution default size benefits from auto-HDR, scene detection and pixel binning, a technique that combines information from multiple pixels to create a better, albeit lower-res, image.
In good light without too much shadowing, the Motorola One Zoom captures a good amount of detail, though by comparison with top-tier flagships like the iPhone 11 Pro Max, doesn’t quite have the dynamic range, holding it back from actual flagship status thanks to what looks like artificially elevated contrast.


Pinch into shots you’ve taken and things still hold up well for the price. The auto-HDR feature prevents challenging scenes from creating black or white spots in highlights and lowlights, even if the results could pick up a bit more nuance, and with Manual mode offering 48MP shooting, you can grab images bursting with information when the lighting is on your side.
There are also plenty of shooting options, including Portrait, Cutout, Spot Colour, Night Vision, Cinemagraph, Panorama, Live Filter, Slow Motion and Timelapse.
In low light, the Motorola One Zoom does a very mediocre job – until you fire up Night Vision mode, which it will prompt you to do. Once active, it can see in the dark with a long exposure like the Huawei P30 and Pixel 3 series. Night Vision isn’t as good as automatic mode on the P30 Pro or the iPhone 11 Pro Max, pulling up more noticeable mottling when you pinch into shots taken in low light. That said, it’s better than almost anything else at this price.



The 3x zoom telephoto camera gets you nice and close to the action and does a fair job in general, provided you don’t shoot RAW or pinch into the shot too much. RAW images captured on the zoom camera pull up a dotted patterning across the whole picture that goes beyond noise, and detail just doesn’t hold up when you pinch right in on shots. For casual viewing on the phone, though, it’s competitive if you shoot in automatic mode.
As for the wide camera, it too does a decent job in good light, taking advantage of the auto HDR feature. That said, when the lights go down, neither it nor the telephoto camera are engaged, with any Night Vision zoom being digital.
One final strike against the camera is the time it takes the pictures to process when you look at your shot straight after capturing it. It’s just a second or two, and it’s kind of cool watching the image go from a 4/10 to an 8/10 just like that. We can’t help but wonder, however, would it have left us waiting after every photo we took if the phone had a faster chipset? 
With a 25MP (f/2.0) front camera, the Motorola One Zoom isn’t a selfie slouch either when it comes to pixels, and while it captures plenty of detail with modes to keep you entertained – most usefully, Portrait mode – it struggles with white balance in artificial light. 
The Zoom captures video at up to 4K resolution at 30fps on the rear camera and image stabilisation is impressive, as is detail at the highest settings. Low-light footage isn’t great with noise creeping in quickly – though that’s the case with most phones, to be fair, even flagships.
Should I buy the Motorola One Zoom?
If you need a good camera that gives you a lot of versatility for under £400 and want stock Android, then absolutely – the Motorola One Zoom is as good as it gets. It’s got a well-built chassis, even if it isn’t the best-looking phone on the block owing to that camera bump. The One Zoom’s screen and battery life are also great, and the beloved headphone jack is accounted for, too.
If stock Android isn’t a must-have for you, the Xiaomi Mi 9T is a better device overall. It has a lot more power, better display, much better design, a similar camera set-up and faster charging, not to mention great battery life. 
The Motorola One Zoom combines a great camera, screen and battery with a mid-range-specced phone. Its camera is loaded up with three focal lengths and manual controls, as well as a capable Night Vision mode. It easily makes it through a day and thanks to that screen, it shines brightly throughout. 
The Zoom isn’t a phone for anyone who needs maximum power for their buck – for this, a gaming phone like the Black Shark 2 would be ideal. Neither is it the best-looking phone for the price: that would be the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro. 
Verdict
The Motorola One Zoom is something of a safe bet – not quite the best at anything, but very good, at least, at everything.

Verdict


































Xiaomi is going after Honor 20 and OnePlus 7 with its new Mi 9T Pro, combining flagship specs and slick design with a mid-range price. Unlike the competition, the Mi 9T Pro has a headphone jack – not to mention an all-screen display, meaning there are no notches or hole punches in sight. 
Looking at photos of the 9T Pro and seeing its specs, it all sounds too good to be true. The phone costs just £399, undercutting the OnePlus 7 by £100, despite outgunning it in the imaging department, with not two, but three rear cameras. 
Featuring what looks like the same all-screen Super AMOLED panel Xiaomi used on its slider, the Mi Mix 3 and Mi Mix 3 5G, the Mi 9T Pro even makes phones over double its price with clunky notches, like the iPhone Xs Max, look outdated.   
But after a week with the phone, does this glowing first impression hold up, or is Xiaomi’s MIUI interface, which has proven notoriously clumsy on phones as recent as the Mi 9 SE, hold it back from greatness?
Design and Screen

Curved glass back and aluminium frame
Pop up camera gives you a full screen look
AMOLED full HD+ display

If you don’t mind not having the skinniest phone on the scene, you’ll be hard-pressed to complain about anything to do with the Mi 9T Pro’s design.
The phone’s curved glass back flows into its aluminium frame like water, is weighted fantastically from top to toe and combines its reflective back with patterning and colour pops.
The Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro’s glass back flows nicely into it’s aluminium frame, with a subtle patterned design and touches of colour
Available in three colours – black, red and blue – with the UK only getting the black and blue options, the camera surround and power buttons feature colour highlights, while the back panel sports a striated patterning, reminiscent of Kevlar but on a much more miniature scale. 
At the bottom of the phone is a USB-C port and SIM tray, which takes two SIM cards, but no SD card. All the phone’s buttons are on the right – a power button and volume rocker, while at the top is the headphone jack and the pop-up camera. 
Every time the camera is activated, it rises with a jingle, and a red LED light strip either side, which looks really very cool.
The pop-up selfie camera’s light is a very cool feature
As with most glass phones, the Mi 9T Pro loves clinging onto fingerprints, and there’s no pre-fitted screen protector. On the plus side, it gets significantly less grubby than the Samsung  Galaxy Note 10 Plus and S10 range, and the phone ships with a hard plastic case in the box for added protection and fingerprint avoidance.
Speaking of fingerprints – there’s an under-display fingerprint scanner onboard the Mi 9T Pro – a feature seldom seen on mid-rangers. While it doesn’t deliver the speed of pricier devices like the OnePlus 7, it does a decent job of getting you into your phone without too much waiting, and it’s preferable to a rear-mounted scanner.
With its Super AMOLED Full HD+ full-screen display, the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro looks exceptional and significantly better than any other £399 device packing flagship specs. 
With over 400 pixels-per-inch (PPI), while the Mi 9T Pro isn’t as sharp as QHD+ phones like the  OnePlus 7 Pro, it’s precisely where it needs to be for the price, going toe-to-toe with the Honor 20 and Honor 20 Pro, and beating out the much more expensive iPhone XR, which clocks in at 326ppi.
No notches or cut outs in sight – the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro has a genuine full-screen display
Viewing angles are very good, as is max-brightness, and with HDR support, the Mi 9T Pro plays back optimised content well. Gaming on the all-screen display is as immersive as it gets, and while the phone doesn’t feature the 90Hz refresh rates found on the likes of the  Red Magic 3, it delivers much better colour accuracy.
Within the settings, there are also options to customise the colour balance, boost the contrast or keep things looking natural.
Performance

Snapdragon 855 chipset alongside 6GB RAM
128GB of storage
No SD card expansion

The Black Shark 2 may be Xiaomi’s current gaming phone, but that doesn’t mean the Mi 9T Pro doesn’t deliver an excellent gaming experience and performance in general. 
Thanks to a Snapdragon 855 processor coupled with 6GB RAM, the phone powers through benchmarks and games alike. While it won’t quite stack-up to dedicated 2019 gaming phones from a numbers point of view, it isn’t far behind, and compared to the best of 2018 – the  Razer Phone 2 and ROG Phone, the Mi 9T Pro wins out.

Only the 128GB model will be widely available in Europe, delivering enough storage for all but the most demanding file, app and game hoarders. That said, there isn’t microSD card expansion support, so if it sounds like too little storage, the Mi 9T pro probably won’t be or you.
Battery life

4000mAh battery inside
You’ll easily get through the day

The Xiaomi Mi 9T packs a 4000mAh battery – a massive bump up when compared to the original Mi 9, which had a significantly smaller 3300mAh cell. Unsurprisingly, it makes it through a full day from 6am to 11pm with about 20% left in the tank with moderate use.
The screen-on time is excellent, dropping by about 7-8% after an hour of streaming at full brightness, and even with gaming, hotspotting and a fair bit of photo taking, we didn’t manage to drain it dry. 
The bottom of the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro has a USB-C port and SIM tray
The Mi 9T Pro doesn’t pack wireless charging, though fast charges at up to 27W. In the box, however, the phone ships with an 18W charger, which impressively gets it from 0-100% in just over an hour. In turn, it’s plenty fast for us and competitive with other fast charging phones.
In the settings, the Mi 9T Pro also features battery saving modes that help you halt rogue applications from firing up, and limit background processes. There’s also a dark mode that can improve battery life, thanks to the phone’s Super AMOLED display saving battery when it showcases true blacks. 
Software
Just like the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, the Mi 9T Pro runs Android 9.0 with MIUI 10, over the top.  Running Android Pie, things start off well, with the latest widely available version of Google’s OS here; both future-proofing the phone and ensuring app support is looking great.
The interface doesn’t include an apps drawer. Instead, it opts for an iOS-esque setup. Shortcuts and widgets can be organised across your home screens, and to the left of these, is a utility display for quick access to features that Xiaomi believes users need to hand. These include tools like a QR code reader and note-taker. There’s also a pull-down notifications tray/quick toggle menu at the top of the screen.
Either gestures or buttons can control navigation, and the whole UI is highly customisable, from the home screen grid-size through to transition effects and more.  There are some annoying quirks, too, though. For example, every time you install an app, it gets scanned for viruses. While this sounds great, it doesn’t merely scan in the background; it takes you to a different screen.
You can remove this feature, and also reinstate an applications tray with a custom launcher, two things we did – after which the experience went from a 60% to a 90%, but if you’re not prepared to tweak the UI to suit you, some elements might get a bit frustrating.
Camera

Triple camera setup on the back
These include an 8MP telephoto and 13MP ultra wide

The Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro’s triple camera has a similar setup to that found on the original Mi 9, a 48MP (f/1.75) primary camera, an 8MP(f/2.4) telephoto camera and a 13MP (f/2.4) ultrawide angle camera.
The primary sensor may be 48MP, but the pictures it snaps are 12MP by default unless you hit the override switch and fire up 48MP mode. This lower-resolution default size benefits from auto-HDR, scene detection and pixel binning, a technique that combines information from multiple pixels to create a better, albeit lower-res image.
In good light, detail captured by the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is superb, though is high when it comes to contrast and saturation on occasions if you have AI scene detection activated. 
 
The level of detail captured by the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro is seriously impressive
Pinch into shots you’ve taken, and things hold up well. This is especially true in the 48MP mode which we’d recommend firing up when lighting conditions aren’t too challenging, and you know you want to grab as much detail as possible.
The camera’s zoom holds up well, too
When HDR is activated, even challenging scenes deliver a healthy amount of dynamic range when captured on the Mi 9 SE. That said, Auto HDR could do with being a bit more sensitive, as it didn’t always fire up when we needed it, so if you don’t see the HDR indicator, remember to override it.
HDR mode can be a little sensitive, so it’s worth ensuring the indicator is displayed
There are also plenty of shooting options. These include Night, Panorama, AI, Portrait and Pro modes. 
In low light, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE does an excellent job for the price. In night mode, it captures atmospheric night shots with slightly bumped up brightness, activating a long exposure like the  Huawei P30 and Pixel 3 series. Even in an automatic mode, the low light performance is respectable from the primary camera.
The telephoto and wide camera both do a decent job in good light, also taking advantage of the auto HDR feature. That said, when the lights drop, we’d suggest avoiding both altogether.
As for the pop-up 20MP (f/2.0) selfie camera, it also features auto HDR, so handles backlit scenes better than most mid-rangers. The Beauty mode isn’t overbearing by default, flattering rather than just flattening subjects. It can also be dialled up and down, which is welcome.
Selfies are sharp and clear, with the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro’s Beauty mode flattering, and not flattening, shots
The detail in selfies is great in good light, but in low light, as noise creeps in clarity naturally drops. On the plus, the screen can double up as a flashlight, which helps things along nicely.
The Mi 9T Pro captures video at up to 4K resolution, and this grabs a superb level of detail for the price, especially in good lighting. Unlike the lower-end Mi 9 SE, and many 4K phones, it shoots up to 60fps, though does so with no stabilisation, so keep your hand steady when maxing out the quality. Drop the frame rate to 30fps, and across 4K and Full HD resolution, stabilisation is excellent, despite the lack of OIS.
You should buy it if…
You’re after a headphone jack
Flagship phones with a 3.5mm port are rare, so if being able to plug your wired cans directly into the phone is important then this is one of the few options in the high-end
You don’t want a notch
The display here isn’t tainted by a notch, nor does it have a cutout to house the front camera. Instead, the selfie cam is inside a pop-up module that only appears when you need it. 
You shouldn’t buy it if…
You want a waterproof phone
The use of a pop-up camera is surely one of the reasons why this phone has no IP rating and isn’t waterproofed in any way.
You want wireless charging
Another feature missing here is wireless charging, something you tend to get on pricier Xiaomi phones. 
Verdict
By combining flagship experiences with a midrange price, the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro has fast become one of the most desirable phones money can buy. In a time of uncertainty – will Huawei phones be worth buying in the coming year with no Play Store access, and is it worth getting a 5G phone just yet? The Mi 9T Pro is the perfect stopgap device that feels and performs like a top-tier flagship, without a sky-high price.

Verdict




























 



This year, probably more than most, the Galaxy Note 10 appears to be a slightly remodelled Galaxy S10, complete with an S Pen. That’s no bad thing – the S10 is one of the best Android phones around – but it would have been nice to see Samsung push forward in areas where the S10 has fallen behind some of the competition; the camera is a good example. The display here is great. 

The design remains the best of any Android phone, and the functionality of the S Pen offers something you can’t get elsewhere. I also really like its slightly smaller form factor. However, the Plus model’s existence is likely to impact negatively on the Note 10. Samsung appears to be driving you towards purchasing the bigger model by restricting such features as expandable storage, screen resolution and camera quality in the Note 10.



Pros

Fantastic size for a Note phone
The S Pen remains great
Very powerful; Cameras are versatile



Cons

Battery life isn’t great
Some missing features such as SD card expandability and quad-HD+ screen

The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 isn’t the true update to the Galaxy Note 9 you may have been expecting. This phone feels like a Galaxy S10e version of the Note: a slimmed-down feature set inside a smaller body.
The big shift for this latest generation of Note is that there are now two models, whereas previously there’s only ever been one. The Galaxy Note 10 is the smaller device here, while the Galaxy Note 10 Plus packs the true flagship specs.
For the most part, these two new Note devices share plenty of specs and features, which makes sense. More problematic is the resemblance that both phones bear to Samsung’s Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus, which launched early in 2019. There’s also the rumoured upcoming Samsung Galaxy S20 and Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra – both of which will likely have better specs.
The Galaxy Note 10 is a decent phone and I appreciate no longer being forced to opt for the biggest screen to experience the benefits the S Pen. However, the fact that there are some key features lacking for the price makes it a harder sell.

How much does the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 cost?
The standard Note 10 comes in one configuration that packs 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM at a price of £869 (or $949, if you’re in the US).
The phone is available now and you can check out our best Note 10 deals page for all the details on how to pick one up. 
Display and design

Two real standouts

On the size scale, the Note series devices have always presented at the larger end. With this year’s two-phone strategy, and the current smartphone trends, things are a little different.
The Note 10’s display at 6.3in is actually smaller than last year’s Note 9, which featured a 6.4in screen. Although not a huge difference, in the hand both handsets feel markedly different, thanks to a new design language on this year’s model.
The display now runs to the edges of the phone’s front, granting it an impressive 90.9% screen-to-body ratio. What’s more, the single Infinity-O hole-punch camera is now centrally aligned at the top of the screen, and therefore less intrusive than the S10’s solo-sensor effort.

Until Samsung does a OnePlus 7 Pro and fits the front camera into a pop-up mechanism or finds a way of submerging it completely inside the display, this is the best solution.
During the review period I’ve been alternating between using the Black and Aura Glow versions of the Note 10. The Aura Glow is the colour Samsung seems to be pushing more than any other. This is hardly a surprise given it’s easily the most eye-catching of the bunch. Would I buy this one if I were in the market for a phone myself? Probably not. It’s nice, yes, but it’s a little garish and looks better in pictures than after it’s been in your pocket for a few days.
As far as aesthetics go, the display and the glass back curve together to create a more compact feel in the hand than you’d imagine viewing it alone.
The actual panel itself could be seen as a downgrade from the previous model; Samsung has lowered the resolution from the QHD+ panel on the S10 and S10 Plus to the FHD+ of the Galaxy S10e. 
Frankly, I think this an odd move. The Note series has always been about having the best of everything, and this move certainly doesn’t fit with that idea. Of course, the screen remains decent, displaying punchy colours and the perfect inky blacks you’d normally associate with OLED panels from Samsung. 
The screen also offers support for HDR10+ – a couple of Amazon Prime shows have this – and the Netflix app has HDR support. Watching videos on this display is great, especially now with the smaller notch, which doesn’t obstruct your viewing as much.
Note that there are a number of reasons that lowering the resolution would make sense for Samsung. The most obvious is that it creates an incentive for buyers to plump for the pricier Plus model. 
There’s also the slight issue of the small battery on offer here (3500mAh versus 4300mAh on the Note 9); the lower-resolution display requires less power, therefore helping to eke out more battery life. However, as you’ll see in the Battery section below, endurance isn’t really a strong point of this phone anyway. 
My biggest disappointment about the Note 10’s display is Samsung’s decision not to up the refresh rate to 90Hz, as seen in the OnePlus 7 Pro, instead keeping it at the usual 60Hz. I love the smoothness of the 7 Pro’s display. Had Samsung opted to do the same, it would have made the Note stand out. Especially now that there are rumours circulating that the upcoming Pixel 4 will have a 90Hz display too.

Read our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus review

The Note 10 also comes in a nice pink colour
Inside the screen you’ll find the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which is the main method of unlocking the Note 10. I’m still not convinced this is much of an improvement over the physical sensor on the old Note phones, since it requires quite a firm press and often doesn’t register my digit. 
S Pen

The biggest trick is the handy stylus

Nestled next to the USB-C port on the phone’s bottom is the S Pen – the hidden trick of the Note 10 and a staple of the series. It’s also the single feature that sets the device apart from Galaxy S10 series. 
The S Pen is supremely responsive when writing or drawing, and it retains all the handy features we’ve seen before. This includes screen-off notes, which allow you to jot down a few points without having to unlock the phone. 
Very little has really changed with the S Pen, and considering there’s virtually no competition, there’s nothing pushing Samsung forward. Much of what is new here is software-based (save for a new gyroscope and accelerometer), including gestures you can perform with the S Pen to snap a photo or zoom in.
These “Air Gestures” are finicky and gimmicky at best. The idea is that you hold the S Pen away from the phone and move it around to zoom in with the camera, for instance. They do work, eventually, but I’m not sure whether anyone will use them consistently. 

Samsung said it has also increased battery life to 10 hours – although I wouldn’t be able to provide you with an example of a time my S Pen has died. It always charges back up when you return it to its home, anyway.
There are a couple of enhancements to the note-taking app, too, with handwriting optical character recognition (OCR) being the biggest. This is fantastic and makes the S Pen a modern notebook. OCR lets you search through your handwritten notes with text, letting you easily find what you’re looking for without manually looking over each page.
MicroSD and headphone jack

Two big Note features have been removed

We all knew it was coming, but with the Galaxy Note 10 Samsung has finally killed the headphone jack. Many have probably come to terms with the death of this port by now – it’s been nearly three years since Apple first made the move – but it nevertheless removes another point of distinction for the Note series.
To make up for this loss Samsung has bundled a pair of USB-C AKG in-ear buds in the box. These sound fine and are an improvement over the EarPods that come bundled with the iPhone. 
What you won’t find in the box is a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter – if you want to use your own buds with this phone, you’ll need to buy one separately. I tried a couple of USB-C headphone dongles I had lying around and they all worked fine.
Another omission is the microSD card slot, removing any form of expandability from the Note 10. Want user-configurable storage? The Note 10 Plus is for you. Like lowering the screen’s resolution, this feels like an obvious push to get people to pay more for a feature we’ve come to expect on Samsung’s phones.
I’d be far more critical of the lack of expandable storage if the default storage wasn’t 256GB. Considering Apple continues to push people to buy £1000/$1000 iPhones with a mere 64GB storage and no expandability, I can’t blame Samsung too much.
Performance

An absolute beast

What powers the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 will vary depending on region. Here in the UK, and other territories including Canada and Asia, the Galaxy Note 10 is powered by the Exynos 9825 – a slightly more efficient version of the S10’s 9820. 
If you’re in the US then you have the Snapdragon 855 version, rather than the newer gaming-focused 855 Plus. RAM stands at 8GB and, as already mentioned, storage is at 256GB. Those of you hoping to make use of the vast array of 5G networks in the UK will have to cough up for the pricier 5G version of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus. There’s no 5G version of the Note 10 available in any region apart from Korea.
After using the European version of the Note 10 for a couple of weeks, it’s safe to say this is a nippy handset. It doesn’t feel any quicker than the S10, and coming from the OnePlus 7 Pro it does seem slower due to the lower refresh display. These are minor niggles, however – although with so many handset feeling super-quick, it’s far more noticeable.
Gaming, on the other hand, is near-perfect. Every title I tried, from intensive games such as Asphalt 9 and PUBG to lighter ones such as Monument Valley 2, worked flawlessly. Loading up a game is still faster on the iPhone XS, but the Note 10 booted everything up quicker than S10.

I did notice a few oddities during my time with the Note 10, however. For one, Bluetooth headphones consistently dropped connection. This wasn’t confined to a single pair – I tried some Bose QC35s, AirPods and even Samsung’s own Galaxy Buds, which actually fared better) – but it proved seriously frustrating. I also had issues with USB-C headphones causing third-party music apps such as Audible and Spotify to crash. Hopefully, these issues will be fixed in a software update. 
Battery life

The Note 10’s weakest point

Samsung’s Note phones have had an excellent reputation among Android devices when it comes to endurance. That’s still the case with the Note 10 Plus, just not as much with the smaller Note 10.
The 3500mAh cell that sits in the latter device just isn’t big enough to power everything on offer here and that leads to middling endurance that often struggled to get me through the whole day – not something I expected from a Note phone.
Throughout my time with the Note 10 Plus, the device normally managed between six and seven hours of screen-on time; with the Note 10 that was cut to about four. Still perfectly adequate for most people, but not really what this series of phones is about.

An hour of Netflix streaming consumed 12% and 30 minutes of Asphalt took the battery down another 15%.
At least the device charges relatively quickly when you hit the red, thanks to much-improved super-fast 25W charging. This is done via a new USB-C-toting charger, and you’ll get a full charge in roughly an hour.
There’s 15W wireless charging, too, and the nifty Wireless Powershare feature lets you use the Note’s battery to recharge other Qi devices, such as the company’s Galaxy Buds or the recently launched Galaxy Watch Active 2.
Camera

Mostly unchanged from the Galaxy S10, it remains a good camera

On the back of the Note you’ll find three cameras: a main 12-megapixel sensor with an aperture that will shift between f/1.5 and f/2.4 depending on the conditions, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide f/2.2 sensor, and a 12-megapixel f/2.1 telephoto camera offering 2x lossless optical zoom.
Both the main and telephoto cameras have OIS (optical image stabilisation) – just as they did on the S10. There are a couple of new AR camera features and you can use the S Pen’s Air Gestures to zoom in and snap a shot without touching the screen. For better or worse, this is mostly the same camera experience you’ll find on the S10 series.
Samsung has consistently offered photo processing that looks pleasing to the eye and is good for social media. Colours have a burst of vividness and saturation that other phones can’t match, and there’s a little extra sharpening added to make everything more detailed. This is the same across all three cameras, and I just admire how it churns out greats shots every time.
The wide camera takes versatile snaps
Night mode turned on
Night mode off
Colours are bright and vivid
It’s also such a good camera app, far more reliable and quicker to navigate than the competition from Huawei and Google. It’s instant when you’re switching between the three sensors or jumping into Portrait mode.
Samsung has added a Night mode to the Note 10 as well. This mode brightens low-light shots, bringing out the light portions and making the whole picture more exposed. It works okay, although I often found that shots taken in this mode were almost too bright. As a result, they could look a little fake. It’s a good job then that the aperture-switching main sensor can take decent snaps in the dark anyway.
More changes come to light when you switch to video. There’s a new mic-zoom feature that will zoom in on the audio you’re recording using beamforming, thus reducing background noise in the process. What’s more, you can add a bokeh effect to videos and photos with “Live Focus”. Around the front, the cutout hides a 10-megapixel single front camera which has a nice wide angle to fit lots in.
Software

One UI, DeX and lots for gamers

Samsung signalled a huge change in its software with One UI and that remains the basis of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10. One UI’s original purpose was to simplify the often convoluted software found on previous Samsung devices, making everything easier to navigate one-handed in the process.
For the Note 10, Samsung has added a couple of new features based around productivity and gaming.
First is DeX. This is Samsung’s PC interface for its Note series. Until now, it’s only been accessible with a dock that’s sold separately. Now you can plug the Note 10 directly into another computer (Windows or Mac) to access DeX, and Samsung has partnered with Microsoft to make it easier to access your notifications, messages, images and so on via a PC.
While the DeX app is a nice idea, it doesn’t work particularly well. It’s slow and buggy, making any task a bit of a chore. However, it does offer a quick way to move photos from your phone to a computer.
Related: Best gaming phones 2019
In general, gaming modes and gaming phones are becoming more popular, and it appears that Samsung wants a piece of the pie.
Instead of releasing a dedicated gaming device, such as the Asus ROG Phone 2, it has added lots of game-specific features to the Note 10 series. You can link it with a PC, for example, and stream games through the PlayGalaxy app. 
Should I buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 10?
This year, probably more than most, the Galaxy Note 10 appears to be a slightly remodelled Galaxy S10, complete with an S Pen. 
That’s no bad thing – the S10 is one of the best Android phones around – but it would have been nice to see Samsung push forward in areas where the S10 has fallen behind some of the competition; the camera is a good example.
The display here is great. The design remains the best of any Android phone, and the functionality of the S Pen offers something you can’t get elsewhere. I also really like its slightly smaller form factor.

What’s the difference between the new Notes? Galaxy Note 10 vs Note 10 Plus

However, the Plus model’s existence is likely to impact negatively on the Note 10. Samsung appears to be driving you towards purchasing the bigger model by restricting such features as expandable storage, screen resolution and camera quality in the Note 10.

What is the Motorola One Action?
The Motorola One Action is an affordable Android phone with an unusual feature – a super-stabilised wide angle action camera. Only the Samsung Galaxy S10 has something similar, among well-known phones.
This lets you shoot very smooth-looking footage with the Motorola One Action while running or cycling. Don’t care about that? This is a solid phone, but battery life could be a little better and its build is not as impressive as the G7 Plus.
But at £219 this is a great alternative to value-packed Honor and Huawei phones, particularly if lingering question marks over those brands’ long-term Android support worry you.

Motorola One Action Design – A very tall phone
There are three important Motorola One Action design choices to note. First, this phone has a 21:9 aspect screen. Its shape is very long, and not at all wide for an affordable mobile with a 6.3-inch screen.
Such a tall screen may seem bizarre if your current mobile has a 16:9 screen, as seen in virtually ever phone until a couple of years ago. However, a day or two in the shape seems almost normal. We humans are an adaptable bunch.
The construction type is the Motorola One Action’s second notable aspect. This phone has a plastic back, not the glass seen in the G7 and G7 Plus. It’s mildly disappointing, and you can tell from the reflections that the plastic bends inward to the fingerprint scanner on the back. Glass is very hard. This plastic is not.

Some Motorola, Huawei and Honor budget phones have “devolved” in this sense over the last couple of years. More use plastic rather than glass, and it’s one reason to choose a Moto G7 instead. That big difference melts away almost completely as soon as you use the bundled case, though. Glass or plastic, your fingers only feel the silicone of the case.
The headphone jack is the Motorola One Action’s third important element. I have used a successions of high-end phones over the last few months, and returning to one with a 3.5mm jack is a refreshing change. You can charge the phone while using headphones, and you won’t have to use an adapter if you own a nice wired set.

A plastic back and headphone jack are two giveaways the Motorola One Action is an affordable phone. The borders are too. This phone has an all-screen front with a punch hole, but the screen borders and the blank black area around the little punch hole cut-out are larger than those of a £500-plus phone. This is no big sin. A punch hole is distracting no matter how small the border is. And at £219, I’m more than happy to live with the compromise.
The Motorola One Action’s rear fingerprint scanner is slightly slower than the best too, including some Huawei/Honor phones at the price. But we’re talking about a fraction of a second, not the kind of delay that should put you off the phone.
You get a lot of storage too – 128GB is enough to house a huge collection of cached Spotify tracks, lots of games and years’ worth of photos.

Motorola One Action Display – Mostly excellent
The Motorola One Action’s 21:9 screen measures 6.3 inches across and has a resolution of 2520 x 1080 pixels. It’s a super-elongated version of “Full HD”.
This screen doesn’t seem quite as big in person as that screen inch count may suggest, because the sheer height accounts for a chunky portion of it.
Revised your expectations? The Motorola One Action’s screen is mostly excellent, with just a couple of irritations.

Its colour is great. There are three saturation levels you can choose between in the settings. It starts with “Vivid”, which looks punchy and tasteful, lacking the polarising hyper-saturated look an OLED phone might have. This screen uses an LCD panel.
Outdoors visibility is unusually good, as the Motorola One Action has very good maximum brightness for an affordable phone. There’s also minimal loss of brightness at an angle, which is again proof of the quality of the screen hardware used.
Want the bad bits? At present the Motorola One Action is not certified to play Netflix at HD resolutions. You’ll see standard definition only at present, although this still looks pretty good on a phone screen.
Related: Best cheap phones

The big punch hole also limits how much of the display can be used for video. Double tap to crop/zoom and it only extends to the punch hole border, so there are still noticeable black bars when watching cinematic aspect movies. This is app-specific, though. YouTube lets you fill the entire screen, usually lopping off the odd head or two in the process.
The Motorola One Action’s auto brightness mode is the other quibble. While maximum brightness is good, the phone tends to aggressively lower display brightness too quickly at times, requiring you to bring up the notification bar controls to change it back.
Motorola One Action Software – Android at its best
The Motorola One Action runs Android P and is an Android One phone. This means it has a version of the system similar to that seen in Pixel phones. Manufacturer tweaks are minimised, and the top layer of the interface has a completely vanilla look.
This means the Motorola One Action likely has a much more gesture-led approach than your current phone. You flick up the screen once to get to the multi-tasking display, and again to get to the app drawer. Or a bigger single swipe sends you direct to the drawer.
So far, so Google Pixel 3.

Moto Display is the most important Motorola addition. This is a standby screen view. When a notification comes in, or you pick up the Motorola One Action, you’ll see the time and icons below representing any outstanding notifications
This is as important a part of Motorola phones’ personality as any case design elements. And unlike some manufacturer additions, this one comes without a downside.
The Motorola One Action also has a bunch of gestures, called Actions. Accidentally turning the torch on (with a double “karate chop”) a bunch of times while running has been my sole interaction with them this time around. But you can also open up the camera with a double twist, or take a screenshot with a three-finger touchscreen press. You can turn these Action gestures on and off independently. Keep the ones you like, ditch the ones you don’t.

Motorola One Action Performance – Powered by Samsung
You might expect the Motorola One Action to run perfectly given it has stripped-back software. It’s not quite perfect at launch, though. I’ve noticed a few little glitches and moments of misbehaviour in the camera app.
However, these all seem minor issues that will soon be ironed out with a software update or two.
The phone’s core processor is a little unusual too. It’s the Samsung Exynos 9610, as seen in the more expensive Samsung Galaxy A50.

This is an 8-core processor with four Cortex-A73 performance cores and four Cortex-A53 efficiency cores. Phone makers often use MediaTek and Samsung processors, rather than the more popular Qualcomm Snapdragon kind, when every penny matters – and that means we see a lot of the lowest-end chipsets.
The Exynos 9610 is not one of these, though, and is perfectly respectable. It just about matches the Motorola G7 Plus for CPU power, scoring 5123 points in Geekbench 4.
GPU power is just slightly worse. The Exynos 9610 has a triple-core Mali-G72 graphics chipset. Like other phones at the price, you can play high-end games like PUBG and Ark: Survival Evolved perfectly well, but in a few the graphics settings need to be cut down a little for smooth results.
Motorola One Action Camera – A true GoPro rival?
The Motorola One Action has a triple rear camera array, but this does not really feel like one in use. You have no choice over the field of view when taking photos. It’s the normal 28mm-ish view or nothing.
This is because one of the additional cameras, a 5-megapixel sensor, is only there for depth sensing. And the other, a 16-megapixel camera, can only be used for video. My best guess here is Motorola barred it from taking photos because the results in testing were not very impressive.
That said, Motorola has made the cunning move of rotating the wide camera sensor by 90 degrees so you capture landscape video when holding the Motorola One Action upright. Switching between it and the main camera for photos would feel clunky.

Its actual job is to capture ultra-stabilised wide angle “action cam” style video. I took Motorola One Action out for a run in the local park to see how it fares compared to the standard camera, which already has pretty solid software stabilisation.
The improvement is real. This action camera feature removes most of the up-down swaying you get when shooting video when running, or even walking. The effect is similar to what you might get with a low-end gimbal, which actively controls the position of the camera, counteracting any minor movements you make while still letting you pan around.
It’s not quite as smooth, of course, but there’s less judder than with the normal camera. And while the video is a little soft, it’s perfectly usable.
The other “extra” camera is less useful. It lets you take images with a blurry background using the Portrait mode.
This is a bit buggy at the Motorola One Action’s launch. The phone has a habit of reporting the camera as blocked when it is not. It then refuses to engage the blur. When it does work the effect can look a little crude and unconvincing, making a worse job of cutting out the subject than Huawei rivals. Stick to actual portraits of people and you will be able to capture some good-looking results, though.

My initial reaction to the Motorola One Action was disappointment, but mostly because I came in fresh, without too much prior research. When you get hold of a triple rear camera phone, there’s an expectation you’ll be able to take photos from multiple fields of view. But you can’t here.
Get over that initial hump and you’ll realise the Motorola One Action is a pleasant budget camera phone. Colour is punchy, day-lit images look vital and contrasty. They are also pretty sharp down to the pixel level. Zoomed in you can see the effect of the image processing, with a character similar to some Samsung phones. There’s none of the vague, dithered look seen in some affordable phones.
HDR processing is very good too. Images with a very high level of light contrast across the frame tend to look significantly better than they do in the on-screen preview.
 
There are a few minor bad parts to consider, and they are similar to those of other affordable Motorolas.
Shooting doesn’t quite feel instantaneous, with a little under a half-second of shutter lag. The Motorola One Action has a habit of overexposing some scenes where there’s no obvious reference point, such as the sky. Sometimes you need to manually alter the exposure to get the shot you want.
Auto exposure has messed up this shot completely
Go manual and you can get much closer to what you are after
Close-up focusing is hit and miss too, pushing you towards the manual mode, which lets you set the focus.
Night images could be better, too. The Motorola One Action handles dingy rooms pretty well. An interior shot of a room lit only by a small off-frame lamp didn’t even compare too badly to the Galaxy Note 10+. But there’s no major enhancement of the light level for street scenes at night, even if you try to increase the exposure manually.
Detail in the brighter areas is good, but there’s very little lifting of the darker parts
Like several previous higher-end budget phones, the Motorola One Action seems to have good hardware, but it doesn’t quite have the software to squeeze out its full potential. There’s no dedicated Night mode, for example. You can shoot 4K video using the main camera, though.
The Motorola One Action shoots 30fps Full HD as standard, and you lose the stabilisation option in the 4K mode. Here are some more sample images I took with the Action:
The background blurring still isn’t great
    
And the selfie camera? It has a 12-megapixel sensor and can use the screen as a flash of sorts in low light. The results are good for an affordable phone, but there’s the usual degradation of detail you’d expect from a cheaper phone in dim rooms.
Motorola One Action Battery Life – Fair rather than great
The Motorola One Action has a 3500mAh battery. Like most affordable Motorola phone bar the G7 Power, its lasting power is fair rather than great.
I can end up with 20% charge by bed time. But on a few taxing days I have had to plug the phone in to make sure it goes the distance. If ultra-long battery life is a top concern, consider the Moto G7 Power instead. It has a mammoth 5000mAh battery and is significantly cheaper. The screen isn’t as sharp, the processor isn’t as powerful. but it’s a great budget all-rounder.

Should I buy the Motorola One Action?
Some of the Motorola One Action’s supposed advancements are slightly thin. This is not a huge step forward from the G7 Plus, but does seem a more well-rounded phone than the spec-hungry One Vision.
The “action camera” won’t actually be useful for everyone, but it’s unusual and lets you take very stable-looking widescreen videos without holding your phone on its side.
CPU power is good for the money, and so is screen quality. You can’t go far wrong here, but even Motorola’s own phones offer compelling alternatives if great battery life or a high-end feel are top priorities.
Verdict
A solid affordable Android with an interesting, if not essential, GoPro-like action camera feature.

Verdict




























 



The Xiaomi Mi A3 is a good choice for an affordable phone, especially if the camera is your priority and you want regular software updates. But if you like watching videos, you could look elsewhere because the screen isn’t up to the highest standards.



Pros

Good value for money
Enduring battery
Clean user interface
Strong camera



Cons

Disappointing screen
No IP rating
Fingerprint sensor can be temperamental






Key Specifications

Review Price: £230
Operating System: Android 9 (Android One)
4GB RAM, 64GB Storage
Weight: 173.8g
Dimensions: 153.5 x 71.9 x 8.5mm

32-megapixel selfie camera
6-inch AMOLED display, 19.5:9 Aspect Ratio, 720x1560 resolution
Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 chip
4030mAh battery


The Xiaomi Mi A3 aspires to be more than a mere budget phone, incorporating premium touches such as an in-screen fingerprint scanner and an IR blaster, not to mention its main selling point – the triple-lens camera. While it gets a lot right, from the battery longevity to camera performance, its achievements have been made at the cost of higher screen quality.
Design  – The Xiaomi Mi A3 looks premium, if a little inconspicuous
The Xiaomi Mi A3 is a fairly large phone, with a screen that measures 6 inches. The rear panel, though plastic, looks good thanks to a glossy finish. Three cameras are present on the back of the handset in a vertically aligned module, while a selfie camera is housed in the teardrop notch at the top of the screen. The notch isn’t all that subtle, but isn’t particularly invasive when watching full-screen videos.
Inspect the sides of the phone and you’ll find several welcome hardware inclusions: a 3.5mm headphone jack, an IR blaster, a microSD card slot, and a USB-C port. Conspicuous by its absence, however, is a fingerprint scanner — that’s because it’s integrated under the screen, much like more premium devices. It’s handy if you want to unlock your device while it’s lying flat on a surface, but it does take noticeably longer to unlock than a traditional scanner.
Overall, it’s a device that looks just fine, though not distinctive, and offers the user a welcome versatility that’s missing even from some flagships.
Camera – The Xiaomi Mi A3’s triple snapper setup is impressive for the price
The Xiaomi Mi A3’s key feature is undoubtedly the triple lens camera. The main 48-megapixel snapper is accompanied by an 8-megapixel wide angle lens and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, again offering considerable versatility.

The camera produces pleasingly well-detailed images. Pinching and zooming on your images will still show sharp edges. Night mode significantly reduces the blown-out lights that you otherwise get, but detail is compromised significantly.
Xiaomi Mi A3: Night Mode
HDR can tend towards overexposure, but can give a more pleasing appearance for those who prefer brighter images to the dull, shadowy realism that prevails otherwise. The selfie camera is impressively sharp, and Portrait Mode accurately cuts out the subject and blurs the background for that crowd-pleasing ‘popping’ effect.
Xiaomi Mi A3: HDR
Software – Android One gives the Xiaomi Mi A3 a clean-cut, pure Android experience
The Xiaomi Mi A3, like all previous entries in the series, runs Android One. This interface strips out all but a few manufacturer apps and offers a very pure Android experience, without the bloatware that can hinder (but occasionally help) your daily experience with the phone.
While some users might be accustomed to the skins developed by various other manufacturers, an undisputed advantage of running pure Android One is that it guarantees software and security updates for years after – a strong selling-point for cheaper phones that often get overlooked for updates.
The clean-cut approach works well for the most part on this device, with only two non-Google apps installed after setup, but the minimalist dogma is taken to an almost masochistic extent when there’s no pre-installed app to use the phone’s IR blaster as a remote control.
In our review of the Xiaomi Mi 9, we recognised that MiUI is certainly not to everyone’s taste, so the adoption of Android One is likely to be a benefit overall, thanks especially to that longer-term software support.
Battery – Its big battery gives the Xiaomi Mi A3 considerable staying power
While it might not catch the headlines in the same way as the triple camera, the battery on this device is just as worthy of praise. With a considerable 4030mAh battery, this phone can last you a long time. After an hour watching YouTube videos, the battery was dented by 8% and an hour of demanding gaming took only 12% off the battery.
In our experience, with moderate usage you could get as much as two days out of out this phone.
Wireless charging is not enabled, as you’d expect on a phone of this price. Fast-charging of up to 18W is possible, but curiously the phone is only boxed up with a 10W charger.
Screen – The Xiaomi Mi A3’s underwhelming display leaves a lot to be desired
The screen measures 6 inches, which is a good size for watching videos; but unfortunately it’s let down by the 720p resolution. It’s not the sharpest display around, and while you’d have to look very closely to spot any actual blurring it is noticeable that images are less sharp and the subjects don’t pop out of the screen in the same way they do on a higher resolution display.
Brightness is just as underwhelming as the resolution, never hitting the heights that you’d expect of most phones.
The upside of these compromises is that they help the Mi A3’s battery go even further. The obvious downside is that videos and games look underwhelming. You’ll likely notice these differences if you’re used to a high-end display.
Performance – Good day-to-day power, but the Xiaomi Mi A3 isn’t a phone for gamers
With a Snapdragon 665 processor, this device is firmly in the mid-range of the market. System navigation runs smoothly, perhaps aided by the clean interface and undemanding screen, but there can be some lag on powerful games like Asphalt 9 at particularly demanding moments.
Apps such as YouTube and Google Maps run well, however, and we noticed no problems when multi-tasking between several different apps.
If you’re a keen gamer, or if you want to rest assured that your phone will handle everything you throw at it in a few years’ time, then it might be worth considering a more powerful device. But most users will be served well by this processor.

Should I buy the Xiaomi Mi A3?
This phone gets almost everything right for the price, including a good camera, a user-friendly interface, decent performance and a strong battery. But the drawback is the disappointing screen.
If you love using your phone to watch videos, this could be a deal breaker. But if you prefer taking snaps or reading text on your device, the Xiaomi Mi A3 will be a reliable handset for you.
Xiaomi Mi A3 — Verdict
The Xiaomi Mi A3 is a good choice for an affordable phone, especially if the camera is your priority and you want regular software updates. But if you like watching videos, you could look elsewhere, because the screen isn’t up to the highest standards.

Verdict




























 



The Oppo Reno Z doesn’t have a unique selling point like the Pixel 3a’s camera. But it earns a spot as one of 2019’s leading mid-range Android phones by getting all the basics right, offering solid battery life and a great screen for bingeing on Netflix.



Pros

Pretty design
Great screen for the money
Solid battery life



Cons

ColorOS adds bloatware and will delay software updates






Key Specifications

Review Price: £299
6.4-inch AMOLED, 2340 x 1080 screen
48-megapixel + 5-megapixel (rear), 32-megapixel (front) cameras
Mediatek P90 CPU
128GB storage/4GB RAM
ColorOS 6 (Android 9)
4035mAh battery with VOOC Flash Charge 3.0


The Oppo Reno Z is a smartphone with lofty aspirations to dethrone the Pixel 3a as Trusted Reviews’ favourite mid-range phone.
And on paper it has the chops to do this, featuring stellar hardware you’d more usually only see on more expensive handsets. But with so many other phones looking to pull the exact same trick, including the Motorola One Vision, you may be justified in wondering what unique features Oppo can bring to the table to differentiate itself from the crowd.
As it turns out, not many. Unlike the Pixel 3a, which has the best camera you’ll find at this price, the Oppo Reno Z doesn’t have one killer feature to sell itself on. What it does, though, is get all the key basics right when it comes to screen, overall design and battery life. This may not make it the sexiest phone around, but it does earn it a place as one of the best value phones currently available.

Oppo Reno Z specs – Top-notch hardware at a rock-bottom price
A few years ago, if you paid £300 for a smartphone you’d be treated to a boxy slab of plastic that was about as alluring as a trip to Slough or Milton Keynes. To this day, lazy design remains an issue at this end of the market – even the Pixel 3a is a little on the dull side visually.
Oppo’s decided to try and buck this trend, and make the Reno Z look as jazzy as possible, loading it with a wealth of flashy colour options and a few design flourishes that are normally reserved for more expensive phones. For a start, it has a glass back. This, plus my review unit’s snazzy purple colouring, instantly make it more alluring than most £300 phones. Be warned, though. As Bon Jovi sang, it gets slippery when wet and will crack if dropped without a case.
It also has a few top-end features including a Huawei P30-style dewdrop notch, dinky bezels and an in-screen fingerprint scanner. The scanner’s not quite as nippy as the P30’s but the fact the tech’s even in a phone this price is seriously impressive.
At first glance, under the hood things are also solid. Powering up the phone I was instantly stunned by how good the 6.4-inch AMOLED screen is, when compared to other phones this price. The 2340 x 1080 is suitably sharp and colours, while a little warm to the naked eye, generally look great. This, plus the Dolby Atmos stereo speaker setup, make it a great phone for Netflix bingeing in bed.

The Oppo Reno Z’s battery – Getting the basics right works
Battery life is also great thanks to Oppo’s decision to load the Reno Z with a giant 4035 mAh cell and its custom VOOC Flash Charge 3.0 tech. With regular use, this combo let me easily get at least two days’ use out of the Oppo Reno X as my main work and personal phone.
This entailed listening to music on my commute, taking and making a few calls, constantly checking my social media and message feeds, plus a game of PUBG and a quick hour on Netflix before bed.
It dealt with demanding tasks like video streaming and gaming pretty well. Streaming video on Netflix with the phone screen at 150 nits (the level most people will be comfortable with), the Reno Z lost an average of 6-8% of its charge per hour, which is excellent. Most phones lose at least 10% running the same process. Gaming was the same – it lost around 12-15% per hour, which again is not to be sniffed at.
The Oppo Reno Z’s camera – Good, but it’s not a Pixel 3a killer
On paper the camera’s a similar story. Oppo’s loaded the Reno Z with a dual-sensor rear camera setup that pairs the 48-megapixel Sony sensor seen on the OnePlus 7 with a secondary 5-megapixel “depth” snapper. Up front you’ll find a 38-megapixel selfie camera. The specs put the Reno X on a par with its arch-rival, the Motorola One Vision, which has a near-identical rear camera setup.
With real-world use I found camera performance between the two is fairly comparable. This means it’s good, but not Pixel 3a level, particularly in low light.
The camera app is fairly stripped down, but it has most of the features you’d expect, including auto, panorama, night, portrait, slo-mo and Google Lens options. The only minor issue is the fact there’s no RAW shooting option, which will annoy enthusiasts, but at this price that’s far from a deal-breaker.
Related: Best camera phone 2019

Shots taken in normal light look good and match, if not beat, the One Vision for quality, though be warned – like the Motorola, shutter speeds can be a little slow and the camera can sometimes push the bokeh effect too far, giving portrait shots a slightly soft feel.
A few years ago I’d have praised the Reno’s low-light performance at this price. The phone can actually take usable images in low light. But hold it next to the Pixel 3a and the difference is clear. Pictures taken on the Pixel 3a in low light have better contrast, are less prone to noise and generally look more realistic than those taken on the Reno Z.
Though again, this is forgivable as it matches, if not beats, nearly every other competing £300 phone’s low-light performance.
The front camera paints a similar picture. For the money, you get great image quality that’s more than good enough to chronicle most drunken students’ clubbing adventures or finding-themselves trip around Europe. The only slight annoyance is that the app seems to softly “beautify” you even when the beauty mode is turned off and, once again, it can be a little aggressive when applying bokeh.
You can see a selection of photos taken on the Oppo Reno Z below.

Oppo Reno Z compromises – Few and far between outside of two issues
The two bigger issues for me stem from the Oppo Reno’s ColorOS Android skin and use of a Mediatek P90 CPU.
ColorOS 6 is a skin that sits over Android 9. It adds a few new features, like custom swipe gestures and access to Oppo’s cloud services, but for the most part I’m not a fan, as it makes a load of needless changes to the OS stellar native UI. None of the changes are terrible, but they make Android 9 look a little childish, replacing native app shortcuts with uglier, simplified versions.
The firm’s also committed the cardinal sin of loading duplicate applications for things like contacts, music and calendar. Again, this is not a deal breaker, as it’s easy enough to hide them. It just clogs up the UI and feels a little pointless when Google’s own do the job fine, and those who use third-party versions probably already have a preferred app that’s not Oppo’s.
ColorOS will also impact how quickly it can be upgraded to new versions of the OS, like the fast-approaching final version of Android Q.
The issue is particularly annoying considering both the Pixel 3a and Motorola One Vision both come with completely clean installs of Android 9.

The Mediatek CPU is another forgivable but slightly annoying downgrade. You’re never going to see a top end CPU like the Snapdragon 855 in a phone this price, but the P90 is a little on the slow side.
Playing games like PUBG with the graphics maxed, it can heat up and I definitely noticed some throttling during prolonged sessions. The 4-6GB RAM also places it firmly in mid-range territory. I’d personally have preferred to see a Qualcomm 6-series CPU used in its place.
Again, it’s not a deal breaker, as the combo of hardware lets the Oppo once again match the rival One Vision. You can see how the two phones faired in Trusted’s standard suite of synthetic benchmarks in the table below. Geekbench gauges the CPU’s performance. AnTuTu is a generalist benchmark that offers an overall gauge of a phone’s performance. 3DMark focuses on gaming performance.
Should I buy the Oppo Reno Z?
If you’re after a phone for your teenage progeny or looking for a decent mid-range smartphone for yourself then you should definitely check out the Oppo Reno Z.
The phone doesn’t change the world of mid-range smartphones the way the stellar Pixel 3a did with its industry-leading camera. But by getting nearly all the basics right it earns a place as one of 2019’s best £300 smartphones, offering solid battery life, an alluring design and top-notch screen.
The only downside is that its custom ColorOS Android skin puts it a step behind the Pixel 3a and Motorola One Vision when it comes to software.

Verdict




























 



At its core, the LG V50 is a retread of last year’s V40 that sports a spec bump and embraces 5G. It’s just a shame the additional screen seems like little more than a gimmick.



Pros

Top-notch performance
Capable audio chops
Decent battery life
5G-ready



Cons

Underwhelming cameras
Dual Display is awkward
Bland design






Key Specifications

Review Price: £64 a month (for 24 months)

4000 mAh battery
128GB storage
6.4-inch OLED
5G support
6GB RAM


LG’s first 5G phone is here in the LG V50 (or V50 ThinQ, to give it its full name) and it comes fully loaded with a Snapdragon 855 chipset, Qualcomm’s X50 modem to enable 5G, a 4000mAh battery and five cameras.
LG is also selling a secondary a clip-on secondary display that turns the V50 into a sort of make-your-own faux foldable.
Related: Folding phones you’ll either love or hate

The LG V50 is late to the 5G party but still wonderfully fast
The LG V50 is both early and late. The company typically releases its G-series devices to hoover up flagship phone sales in the first half of each year and then introduces a new V-series entrant around six months later to tie the year off. With the arrival of 5G, LG broke convention.
The Korean company announced both the LG G8 and the LG V50 side by side at Mobile World Congress in February, with the G8 serving as its 4G flagship and the V50 its 5G flagship.
This may account for the numerous similarities between the V50 and its predecessor – LG had less time to innovate between generations. The company instead focused on getting 5G working in a phone and making sure the rest of the hardware could keep up – resulting in tweaks like a larger 4000mAh battery (the LG V40 featured a 3300mAh cell).
Related: What is 5G?
Despite being one of the first 5G phones to be announced, it’s actually hitting the market much later than competition such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 5G, OnePlus 7 Pro 5G and Oppo Reno 5G – most of which were unveiled after the V50.
Late or not, the LG V50 leverages the same X50 modem as most of the competition and my testing highlighted the infancy of live 5G right now, even in principle hubs like London.
Testing out of the Trusted Reviews headquarters in Canary Wharf, the V50 averaged 23Mb/s down and 20Mb/s up on EE’s 5G network but near-identical speeds when running on the carrier’s 4G network. As such, LG may be getting in ahead of mainstream 5G adoption but, as a result, the V50 suffers under EE’s nascent 5G infrastructure, diminishing one of the main reasons to pick up this phone over flagships still limited to 4G speeds.
Read next: 5G in the UK
If 5G is your main reason for wanting a new phone, the value of handsets like the V50 is currently dictated more by the speed at which carriers like EE and Vodafone upgrade and flesh out their 5G networks than the hardware in the phones themselves.

Does the LG V50’s Dual Screen accessory make it a worthwhile foldable?
One of the other big selling points that LG is pushing with the V50 is support for a new Dual Display accessory. It snaps around the V50’s body and adds a secondary 6.2-inch Full HD+ OLED panel to the left of the phone’s own 6.4-inch FullVision display.

The resultant experience this second-screen offers is… odd. Don’t go in expecting Samsung Galaxy Fold or Huawei Mate X levels of foldable coherence; compared to the elegant glass and metal build of the V50 itself, the Dual Display is a mix of chunky matte black plastic, a glossy outer face that looks like a display but isn’t and the screen itself – it’s a bit of a mess, not to mention the added thickness and weight it imposes on the V50’s overall form.
It connects, elegantly enough, using three POGO pins that align with contact points on the back of the V50’s body and once you tap the power button that appears at the edge of the V50’s display, the secondary screen blinks into life.

There’s an ever-present menu that lets you switch content between the two screens or move content from one to the other, which all works seamlessly and quickly. The second screen is treated almost like a secondary device, with an apps drawer all its own. You can also choose to synchronise the brightness levels of both screens or control them independently.
LG posits that it holds value as a mirror for your selfies, for hosting an additional user in video chat or by displaying a virtual gamepad when gaming, but I found any real-world benefits to be tenuous at best.

I usually wound up running a chat app like Slack alongside a portrait-friendly game like Pokémon Go or streamed a video on YouTube while browsing the web when in landscape. Some apps simply don’t play nice with the Dual Display – Netflix, for example, will instantly pause should you touch the opposing screen, making it unusable.
As for the gamepad feature, having to use touch-based controls while concentrating on another screen made experiences like Fortnite harder to control rather than easier – and most titles didn’t offer full support or were miscalibrated with no way to tweak sensitivity. The 105-degree upright position that the screen can lock to is also terrible for gaming or viewing in landscape.

I appreciated its ability to double as a stand, but paired with the incompatibility found on certain apps and games, the unusual difference in aspect ratios and viewing angles between both screens, and the added bulk and weight, if it doesn’t come bundled with your V50, I’d leave it well alone.
The LG V50 should offer enough power for most users
The phone’s 5G functionality comes thanks in part to its use of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 chipset, which works happily with that all-important X50 modem. It’s also a great piece of hardware in its own right, ensuring the user experience offered up by the V50 remains solid, speedy and stable. Pairing it with 6GB of RAM means you’re not going to get the fastest phone out there, but in benchmarking tests it’s among the highest-scoring phones through Trusted’s doors this year.

I did encounter the occasional lock-up and the phone did restart on one occasion, but I place the blame on LG’s heavy-handed software rather than on the hardware struggling under any real load. When using the dual display and running two apps side by side, the V50 also didn’t seem to be bothered by such demands, which was pleasing to see.
As for the battery, the jump to a 4000mAh cell ensures that even when using the dual display, you can expect a day’s use without worry, while using the phone as a standalone experience bumps longevity from four to almost five hours of screen-on time.

I ended most days with between 30% and 15% charge, depending on usage, and powering the phone back-up takes approximately one hour and 50 minutes using the included 18W fast charger. Integrated wireless charging also adds a layer of convenience to proceedings.
It’s also worth mentioning the V50’s audio capabilities, which excel over most of the current market (the LG G8 notwithstanding). There’s a customary quad-DAC onboard, with a traditional headphone jack, plus rich EQ controls and DTS:X 3D Surround for a strong overall audio experience.

Five cameras may sound impressive but the V50 isn’t much of an upgrade
The flat glass back of the V50 plays host to an impressive triple camera arrangement, while the front-facing dual-sensor set-up is a nice alternative to that of the Google Pixel 3. Both sides feature a main sensor and an ultra-wide sensor, alongside an additional telephoto sensor on the back.

In truth, this is a seemingly identical arrangement to the V40’s five cameras, right down to resolution, aperture and pixel size. The improved AI prospects of the new chipset are what LG is leaning on, with shooting modes like Studio and AI Cam meant to intelligently add effects or enhance colour and contrast based on what the phone detects is in-frame.

For the best results in most scenarios, it’s best to juggle between Auto and AI Cam, with the latter sometimes making better use of available light, expressing a wider dynamic range and better white balance in resultant imagery. It should serve as the sole shooting mode, however, as it does have a tendency to over-saturate images, which is where Auto steps in to capture more realistic shots.

As for low-light shooting, even with the phone’s Night View mode, you’ll struggle to achieve shots that even come close to the likes of the Pixel 3 or the current low-light king, the Huawei P30 Pro.
AI Cam (left), Night View (right) – use the slide bar to move between the two images
Where the V50 impresses is with its video capture; more specifically its stabilisation. The phone can shoot up to a 4K at 60fps, which isn’t something available to every current Android flagship, while stabilisation while shooting at lower resolutions and frame rates is some of the most stable I’ve seen from a phone.

Should I buy the LG V50?
For a phone that embraces the arrival of 5G in 2019, the rest of the experience offered by the LG V50 still feels decidedly 2018.
The fact that most of the key hardware beyond its processor, modem and battery remains unchanged compared to last year’s LG V40 is challenging enough, not least when the inclusion of 5G pushes the phone’s price up so high.
If you definitely need a 5G phone, the V50 is a capable all-rounder. However, most of the other entrants out there will more readily delight and impress with superior designs, hardware talents or slicker software.
Like the G8, beyond its connectivity, its audio capabilities are to be applauded. Nonetheless, it’s tricky to recommend against stiff competition that offers more for less.

LG V50 release date and price
In its native market of South Korea, the LG V50 is available for ₩1,199,000 (around £815/$980). In the US, the phone is available from both Sprint and Verizon, with both carriers offering the phone on contracts starting at $19 a month and $41.66 a month respectively. Both carriers also let you buy the phone outright upfront for $999.99 (approximately £830).
In the UK, the LG V50 is available for pre-order, with buymobilephones.net selling it on a variety of 5G EE contracts from £64 per month with a £264.99 upfront cost. The story is similar with Carphone Warehouse, which is also selling it on a variety of 5G EE contracts from £64 per month, but with a lower £149.99 upfront cost and the inclusion of the phone’s Dual Screen accessory.
Buying direct from EE also lands you the LG Dual Screen, with 4G plans starting at £59 a month (plus a £50 upfront cost), while the carrier’s 5G plans start out with the same price of £64 per month, again accompanied by a £50 upfront handset cost.

Verdict





























 



While the Samsung Galaxy S10 doesn't excel in any one specific area, the collective package makes for an incredibly capable offering – which I'm sure was Samsung's aim in the first place. It sports a stunning OLED screen, versatile camera and a number of enticing new features. It's a great phone.



Pros

Smaller than lots of other flagships, without sacrificing features
Versatile camera that reliably takes excellent pictures
A lovely screen that’s fantastic for video



Cons

One UI is full of bloatware
Battery life is middling

With the rumoured Samsung Galaxy S20 and Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra looking like they’ll see an official release soon after months of leaks, should you still be looking at the Galaxy S10? 
The Galaxy S10 sits alongside the Galaxy Note 10 at the top of Samsung’s phone line. It’s the perfect mass-market device, ticking pretty much all the boxes anyone looking for a new Android phone will want.
Alongside the S10 you also have the smaller, simpler, more affordable Galaxy S10e (which boasts the same top-tier processor), the larger, longer-lasting and more camera-laden Galaxy S10 Plus, and for those who need it, the super-sized, super-speedy Samsung Galaxy S10 5G.
With all these other options, should the standard Galaxy S10 still be worth considering? In a word, yes.
The Samsung Galaxy S10 is a gorgeous phone with a 6.1-inch display
The Samsung Galaxy S10’s screen is lovely and design slick, with a minor catch
As with most top Samsung phones, the screen left me seriously impressed. The S10 sports a 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED display, which occupies 88.3 percent of the phone’s front. Paired with the curved cover glass, it gives the impression of a true edge-to-edge display and what’s more it packs in a ton of tech worthy of a flagship-class display.
This is an HDR10+ panel, boosting colours and dynamic range when viewing supported content from Netflix and YouTube, for example. Watch a few episodes of Star Trek: Discovery and you’ll instantly notice the deep colours and intense brightness. I wouldn’t normally use a phone screen to watch this kind of content over extended periods but the quality on display here makes it surprisingly immersive.

The screen is bright, too, which is essential for both outdoor viewing and, as previously mentioned, HDR content. It’s a little tricky to gauge just how bright this screen gets due to the variety of boosting modes Samsung engages but I measured a peak brightness of 350 nits (which is good for a phone) in regular use. DisplayMate claims it can match the 1250 nits suggested by Samsung in its own tests, however, we were unable to recreate such a figure in a real-world environment.
Brightness ramps up further when you’re using the phone in direct sunlight or utilising the screen enhancer mode. The latter adds a faux-HDR effect to regular content – YouTube videos, for example – which ups the brightness to give a more cinematic look. It works a treat, even if it does consume battery life at double the rate compared to when it’s turned off.

The display has a few other quirks, too, all of which help to shape the look of the Galaxy S10. The first is the new Infinity-O display, which is Samsung’s effort to steer away from the plight of a notch. Instead of a dip in the display, as seen on the iPhone XS, the S10 moves its front camera into a circular cutout that sits towards the top-right of the panel. Unlike the notch, the screen flows around the camera, creating a more seamless finish.

Best Samsung phone

I much prefer the circular cutout here rather than the longer, pill-shaped version you’ll find on the S10 Plus; it’s noticeably less intrusive when watching videos. Nevertheless, it isn’t perfect and certain apps – games especially – still assume the hole is a notch and therefore display a black bar that covers the entire top portion of the screen. Hopefully, developers will update said apps as this style of cutout becomes more popular.
The Bixby button remains below the volume rocker
I’m less enamoured by Samsung’s continued use of curved displays. As seen in the S8 and S9, the sides of the Galaxy S10 slope away from the front, blending into the metal frame running the phone’s edge. Design-wise, it’s a trait that’s a few years old now and extensively used by other premium phones. Nevertheless, it still has that slick, instantly eye-catching finish that gets it noticed in the sea of boxy, rectangular slabs.
Despite how attractive it might look, it makes actual use of the device more difficult. I’ve experienced more accidental presses with the curved Galaxy S10 than I have done with the flat Pixel 3 (or Pixel 4 for that matter) or iPhone 1. It consistently registered accidental pressure from my palm and I’m having to alter the way I hold the phone to counter this problem. You’ll likely get used to it but having used both the S10 and S10 Plus for a few weeks, it remains an issue.
For the most part, the rest of the design also follows the same blueprint Samsung’s employed for the past few iterations of its flagship phones. You’ll find glass both front and back, a metal rim sandwiched between them, and a super-precise finish.
There isn’t much of a size difference between the Plus and the regular-sized S10 (the Plus has a 6.4-inch screen as opposed to 6.1-inches) but I do find that the smaller device feels more comfortable to hold and is easier to navigate, not requiring me to stretch my thumb too far. If you’re coming from an S9 or an iPhone then you’ll likely feel a lot more at home with the S10 compared to the Plus.
One feature missing on the Galaxy S10’s display is a high refresh rate option. The OnePlus 7 Pro, for example, can ramp things up to 90Hz creating much smooth motion and animations on-screen. Maybe this is something we’ll get with the Galaxy S11, next year.
The Galaxy S10 is feature-packed, with an in-display fingerprint sensor and reverse wireless charging
Samsung has a fondness for “features”. It loves to cram its phones with every imaginable option, if only to have plenty to shout about when it comes to advertising. It’s an approach that’s quite the opposite of Apple, which has historically rejected options such as expandable storage.
With the Galaxy S10, Samsung’s focus on features remains. If there’s a feature you’ve been hankering after, then it’s likely included in the S10: wireless charging, expandable storage, a headphone jack (you won’t see that too often in 2019), as well as inventive additions such as reverse charging and an in-display fingerprint sensor.
That in-display sensor is the standout – and while the S10 isn’t the first handset to include one, it’s comfortably the best I’ve used.
The fingerprint sensor is now beneath the display. When you use it, the display ripples just like the above.
The fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S10 doesn’t reside on the back or inside the home button. Instead, it’s found directly beneath the screen. Once set up – a process you’ll be requested to do at the start – you unlock the phone by pressing your finger against a fingerprint outline that sits towards the bottom of the screen. It does everything your traditional capacitive sensor does; it just doesn’t need to be there messing up the back of the phone.
As futuristic as it is, the in-display sensor isn’t quite as effective as the traditional unit of the S9 or iPhone. It requires a firmer press. If the fingerprint sensor on the S9 works 95% of the time, on the S10 it’s closer to 70%.
However, since release there have been some claims the fingerprint scanner isn’t secure when used with third-party screen protectors and you can unlock the phone with any finger. Samsung said it will issue a software update to hopefully fix this issue.
Another feature on the S10 that’s similar to something you’ll see on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro is reverse wireless charging. Called Wireless PowerShare, this lets you turn the S10 into a Qi charger for compatible products. For example, you could charge your iPhone XS this way, or Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds. 
It’s a clever addition but like the in-display fingerprint scanner, it needs a bit more work. It’s super-slow to charge, and you need to turn it on every time you want to charge a device.
The Galaxy S10’s benchmarks lead to the superb performance
Joining the packed feature list is a selection of internal components – which will vary depending on your region. I’ve been using the European model, which ships with Samsung’s own Exynos 9820 chipset and 8GB of RAM. If you’re buying the phone in the USA, your device will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855.
Since the S10 is powered by the very latest available internals, it should be no surprise that it’s a performance beast, churning out benchmark scores at the top-end of phones we’ve reviewed. Simply put, no task on this phone feels slow or laggy. Nor are there any apps – that I’ve tested – that really push the hardware to its limits.
The same is true of games. The Galaxy S10 will smoothly run any game at the highest possible settings without running into trouble. Titles load up noticeably faster than a Samsung Galaxy S9, and only slightly slower than an iPhone XS.
It packs a complete selection of high-end specs
This is also one of the first handsets to ship with support for Wi-Fi 6, so if you have a capable router then you’ll notice a slightly altered logo in the status bar. There’s no 5G, though, since the next-gen data speeds are restricted to an as-yet priceless Samsung Galaxy S10 5G variant.
The Galaxy S10’s camera is versatile, even if it isn’t the best overall
The Galaxy S10’s camera line-up is another headline feature. Three can be found on the back, with another unit on the front for selfies and face unlock. It’s a trio of cameras that will look familiar to anyone who has laid eyes on the Huawei P30 Pro
The main rear camera is an optically stabilised 12-megapixel sensor, with an aperture that can shift between f/1.5 for night shots and f/2.4 for the day. There’s an ultra-wide, 16-megapixel f/2.2 sensor, too, and a stabilised 12-megapixel telephoto sensor for zooming.
Of the three, it’s the ultra-wide sensor that’s new. In the app, you can zoom out to enter wide view and there’s somewhat of a fisheye effect on the results.
Three cameras sit on the back of the Galaxy S10
The main camera consistently judges exposure better than its predecessor, while the improved HDR mode helps give you a good dynamic range across most scenes, with fewer blown out highlights and overexposed shots.

The latter isn’t quite on the same level as the iPhone XS’s Smart HDR mode, though, which manages to pull out much more detail from the dark areas of dimly lit scenes.
Daylight snaps look fantastic
You can get up close to subjects and pull lots of detail
Low light performance, in general, is good if a little behind the very best – that honour goes to the Huawei P30 Pro with its RYYB Super Sensing sensor and fantastic dedicated night mode. 
The main camera’s bright f/1.5 aperture (which automatically reverts to f/2.4 in brighter conditions) gives it a strong base to work from, though the S10 can still be a bit heavy-handed with noise reduction and image processing, which smudges out some fine details. This isn’t too noticeable when viewed on the S10’s screen, but photos can look more like paintings when cropped or viewed on a bigger screen.
It deals excellently with tough pictures with dark and light areas
The S10’s smarter ‘scene optimiser’ mode, which works on all three cameras, performs well in most situations. It can now recognise up to 30 different scenes, including faces and night scenes, and tweaks the colours to make them vibrant and punchy without going too far towards oversaturation.
The only downsides are the occasional mistake – for example, recognising a glass building as the sky and giving it an unnatural blue cast – and that its Super Night Shot mode doesn’t seem to be quite as powerful as the ones seen on the Google Pixel 3 or Huawei Mate 20 Pro, with no way to manually turn it on.

Best camera phones

Still, the S10’s bokeh effects are every bit as good as its rivals, only being slightly beaten out by the P30 Pro and its dedicated ToF sensor. This added sensor gives a cleaner finish and a more accurate cut around details like glasses and hair.
Still, the S10 reliably cuts out faces and objects while applying realistic gradual blur. You can also tweak the level of fake bokeh after a shot when using the Live Focus mode, but it’s best to keep the intensity on the low side for maximum realism.
It does a good job with the bokeh portrait mode
While nothing major, there do seem to be a couple of bugs in the S10’s own camera app. The focal length wheel, which lets you zoom in between each camera’s default view, sometimes opens when you try to press the shutter, preventing you from taking a shot. If you move quickly between the three cameras, the autofocus also occasionally locks up before settling down again. These will no doubt get fixed in a software update.
Video recording is handled well, especially thanks to the new super-steady stabilisation option. This uses the ultra-wide sensor to record and then crops in, smoothing out your footage and ridding it of the judder often associated with mobile video recording.
But Samsung Galaxy S10’s battery life should have been better
Samsung has crafted an excellent phone in the S10 with a gorgeous screen, high-end internals and a bevvy of great features all packed inside a well-designed body. However, it isn’t perfect.
Samsung’s One UI sits atop Android 9, and while it’s a big improvement over Samsung’s previous attempts at software, it remains ugly and bloated.
One UI’s aim is to make the software elements more accessible on larger screens. Apps that feature multiple input options towards the top – messages, for example – are pushed to the bottom, so you don’t need to dislocate your thumb trying to reach them. The majority of Samsung’s own apps have been updated to benefit from this design, and it does make navigation easier.
But the software is still full of useless additions. The virtual assistant Bixby is, and always has been, inferior to Google’s excellent Assistant – but it’s so tied into Samsung’s apps that it’s hard to get rid of. There are reams of bloatware here too, including multiple Microsoft Office apps and Samsung’s own version of many of Google’s own apps – calendar, browser and messages, for example.
For battery life the S10 isn’t as good as some rivals; even similarly sized handsets such as the Huawei P30 Pro beat the S10 for endurance. However, it’s slightly better than the Galaxy S9 and roughly comparable with the iPhone X and iPhone XS. 
During my 10 days with the phone – I’ve been reviewing the European Exynos 9820 version, so US-based buyers with the Snapdragon 855 version might see different results – I haven’t always managed to get from a morning alarm to 11pm without forcing the phone into either a battery-saver mode or worrying it will die-out during something important.
If you want a more detailed look at the battery life, head to our dedicated Samsung Galaxy S10 review battery life page.
Using the bundled charger, the S10’s 3400mAh battery goes from 0-100% in around 90 minutes. You can get yourself 40% in roughly 40 minutes which is handy for a quick top-up.
There haven’t been any huge improvements to the charging tech, and there’s no high-speed method to rival the Mate 20 Pro’s Super Charge. This is a shame, but the lack of improvement isn’t quite as obvious as it is with the larger S10 Plus as that battery takes much longer to charge.
If wireless charging is more your style, expect to get a full charge in just over two hours if you’re using Samsung’s own Fast Charge capable pad.

Why buy the Samsung Galaxy S10?
There isn’t a more complete flagship Android phone you can buy right now than the Samsung Galaxy S10 – and its two biggest competitors are, at this moment, the smaller S10e and the pricier S10 Plus.
So is there a reason to buy the S10 over those two other choices? The S10e is cheaper and ditches the curved screen, while the S10 Plus has a bigger screen and battery. Being the middle child, it does feel like the regular might get left out. But I’d say the S10 is the easiest choice. It’s the perfect mixture of size and feature-set, with a price tag that’s £200 less than the iPhone XS.
Samsung Galaxy S10 price and release date
The Samsung Galaxy S10 is on sale right now.
Prices in the UK start from £799 for the 128GB model and £999 for the 512GB model. In the US, it costs $899. As such, the Samsung Galaxy S10 is £60/$180 more expensive than the Samsung Galaxy S9 when it launched in February 2019. Or you could view it as being £200/$100 cheaper than the iPhone XS.
In the UK, all major carriers – EE, Vodafone, Three and O2 – are stocking the phone, alongside Virgin Mobile and Tesco Mobile. Check out our Samsung Galaxy S10 deals for all the latest news on pricing and the best offers.
This review is of a Galaxy S10 (UK Exynos 9820 version) unit provided to us by Vodafone, and was conducted over the course of ten days – with additional days afterwards for more in-depth testing.

If you like your smartwatches big, brash and brutish then this Diesel-branded take from the Fossil Group should be right up your street. This designer wearable makes the Apple Watch 4 and Fitbit Versa look positively tiny in comparison.
The Diesel On Full Guard 2.5 (try saying that name five times, fast) is part of Fossil’s fourth-generation wearable line and is the second watch it’s released under the Diesel brand.
It shares many of the same technologies as other fourth-gen Fossil watches, like last year’s Emporio Armani Connected and the Skagen Falster 2, albeit with distinct stylings across both the hardware and software all its own.

Design – The Diesel On Full Guard 2.5 embodies the brand’s bold image
What really sets this watch apart from the crowd has to be its design. Whereas some smartwatches look like mini computers on your wrist, the On Full Guard 2.5 looks very much like a traditional timepiece.
The metal body is unabashedly chunky, with three buttons (one of which is a rotating crown) sitting to the side of the sharp 1.4-inch OLED display.

I’m not one for big watches and, as soon as I put on this one, it felt out of place on my relatively dainty wrists. However, if you’re used to wearing sizeable timepieces, such as Diesel’s extensive portfolio of non-smart watches (and like the Diesel ‘look’) then it’ll no doubt feel right at home.
The particular watch I reviewed was sporting the black silicone finish, which comes accented by knurled metalwork running the edge of the body and around the buttons that sported an anodised red treatment – but the On Full Guard 2.5 is available in four distinct finishes that are collectively a blend of black and silver, brushed and polished metalwork, brown leather and blue accenting.

All of the finishes make a similarly bold statement but depending on your tastes, you do have the option of more conservative styling if preferred. What’s more, their design grants you the ability to swap out the included straps with any equivalent 24mm band, made that much easier by the inclusion of quick-release pins.
Screen – A big display for a big watch
Depending on how you intend to use your smartwatch, there’s a chance you’ll spend a notable amount of time staring at that circular display. At 1.39-inches, it’s one of the largest screens out there on a Wear OS wearable (its predecessor sported a 1.4-inch display), meaning text and iconography is easily legible – the 400 x 400 resolution doesn’t hurt either.

The use of AMOLED tech means it’s nice and vibrant, and contrast is decent too. I’d argue that maximum brightness could be improved so that viewing the watch in full sunlight was a bit easier but it’s still possible to see the screen in most scenarios.
OLED tech also helps support the watch’s always-on functionality, which I prefer as it makes checking the time that much more instant, compared to waiting for the On Full Guard to detect that you’ve raised your wrist in order to ignite the screen.
Software – Wear OS with some real character
Being a product of the Fossil Group means this smartwatch sports near-identical internals and software to that of alternatives like the Skagen Falster 2 and last year’s Emporio Armani Connected. Most brands differentiate their experiences with unique watch faces or watch face customisation options but Diesel has taken things a step further.

The T-ON-I ‘assistant’ was introduced with the original On Full Guard smartwatch and makes a return for Diesel’s second outing into Wear OS. It pulls data you’re likely to want to keep tabs on, like the current weather or your steps, but presents them with a personified ‘voice’ that’s equal parts indifferent and sassy.
It’s Diesel’s attempt at placing more character into an otherwise function-first experience and I think the team behind T-ON-I have achieved this. On more than one occasion I snickered at news of impending rain and the watch’s suggestion that there wasn’t anything worth going outside for anyway. I also scoffed at its derision at my low step count, even though we weren’t even halfway through the day.

Beyond Diesel’s stylings, the On Full Guard runs Google’s Wear OS. It’s seen a raft of updates recently, with an easier-to-navigate UI and improved Google Fit features – both of which were very much needed, but there’s still work that could be done to offer a more fluid and consistent user experience.
Build quality and features – Familiar hardware that still underwhelms
Like other recent Fossil Group releases, the On Full Guard 2.5 boasts proper water resistance (with swim-tracking), integrated GPS for more accurately tracking your runs, an optical heart-rate monitor and support for Google Pay via NFC.
 Being able to quickly scan your wrist at contactless terminals to pay for stuff is one of the coolest smartwatch features out there and one of my favourite use cases for wearables in general. As with many of its lunch sibling, the reliability of the On Full Guard’s NFC isn’t as rock-solid as Apple Pay on the Apple Watch, making it a tougher recommendation for daily use.

As for fitness tracking, while the bevvy of trackable activities found within Google Fit continues to grow, people looking for reliable metrics shouldn’t place their faith in the hardware on offer here. It’s fine for step tracking and the heart rate sensor isn’t that far off other optical wrist-worn trackers, but for those serious about fitness, turn to wearables from devices with pedigree in this area, like Garmin and Fitbit.
Related: Best fitness trackers 2019
The Snapdragon Wear 2100 is the wearable processor of choice for pretty much every Wear OS smartwatch out there. The problem is that it’s an ageing chip (originally released back in early 2016) and on modern smartwatches like the Diesel On Full Guard 2.5, that age is starting to show. As such, the software feels sluggish and sometimes the Diesel would simply lock up, requiring multiple restarts or at the very least, a desire to be left alone for several minutes while it tried to untangle any muddled processing.
Qualcomm has since launched the Snapdragon Wear 3100 but with improvements focussed wholly on power efficiency, there’s still a question as to whether opting for the newer chip would fix the One Full Guard’s buggy performance.
Battery – The Diesel On Full Guard 2.5’s smaller cell doesn’t bode well
Perhaps more so with smartwatches compared to phones, mileage will vary depending on your usage habits. The On Full Guard 2.5’s 300mAh is a notable downgrade from its predecessor’s 370mAh cell size, which already didn’t result in the most impressive battery life.
Using the out-of-box settings, with elements like tilt-to-wake (the screen) and touch-to-wake enabled, I ended each day at around 55%, provided I made the jump to battery saver mode in the evening. Add NFC usage into the mix and you’ll see a notable drop, with the On Full Guard finishing each day at 35% instead.

Trading NFC use for constant monitoring from the optical heart rate sensor will leave you with around 45% at the end of the day, and as ever, the biggest killer to wearable battery life is the use of integrated GPS, which although convenient, sapped a hefty 6% after just 15 minutes tracking a run.
As mentioned, I like to set my smartwatch display to ‘always-on’ where applicable, which paired with my light NFC across London transport and a touch of GPS tracking for ten minutes or so to log my walk home resulted in a lowly 23% left in the tank by the end of the day.
It’s unclear why Fossil dropped the battery capacity between generation one and two of the Diesel On Full Guard but in real-world use, it doesn’t benefit the user in any way and effectively stifles how much you’re likely to use the watch’s features, assuming you want to make it to the other end of the day with the thing still ticking (metaphorically).
The silver lining in all this is Fossil’s improved charger design, which still relies on magnets to secure the charger to the back of the watch’s body but now uses a direct connection between two contact points on the charging base and two concentric charging rings on the underside of the On Full Guard.
This means you can still charge the watch in any orientation but it’s far less likely to accidentally misalign or detach, making for a more reliable charging experience.
In 30 minutes the On Full Guard 2.5 filled to 47% charge, in an hour it had reached 85% and the watch was full after a full 1 hour and 20 minutes – underwhelmingly slow for such a small-celled device, but a speed that highlights the value of the fast-charging tech that most modern smartphones offer.
Should I buy the Diesel On Full Guard 2.5?
Like the rest of the latest crop of Fossil Group watches, the Diesel On Full Guard 2.5 is well-stocked with features, ticking all the important boxes that you’d expect from a current-generation smartwatch. But while the image it presents is one of bold confidence, with its distinctive styling and the characterful T-ON-I assistant, there are issues with the execution.

Scratch away the Diesel-branded surface and the underlying hardware just isn’t good enough, especially for the £300+ asking price. The chipset is too dated and laggy, the fitness tracking is inaccurate and the battery life average.
Verdict
For those committed to the Diesel name in search of a smartwatch that isn’t an Apple Watch, there’s enough here to satiate your desires without feeling completely swindled. For anyone without such brand loyalty, the Diesel On Full Guard 2.5 is a usable option but not a first-choice.

What is the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e?
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e is an Android tablet, and one of the best alternatives to an iPad.
It’s currently Samsung’s top 2019 tab and in some ways a successor to the Galaxy Tab S4. But it uses a lower-end processor to help bring down the asking price to below £400 (for the 64GB version).
Related: Samsung Galaxy S20
As such, it will appeal to those looking for just a tablet, as opposed to a device to replace their laptop. Its design and screen are delightful, too.
The main issue is the current standstill state of Android tablet progression. Tablets are great devices to entertain younger kids, but the Samsung Galaxy S5e is arguably far too fancy to fulfil that demand. A new feature such as Google Stadia support would give tablets, in general, a renewed sense of meaning.

Design
Samsung’s previous top-end tablet followed the design philosophy of many a flagship smartphone – it featured a glass back and metal sides. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e sticks to a more traditional tablet style. It’s aluminium all-round, apart from the glass pane above the screen, of course.
Cheaper to manufacture it may have been but I prefer this design to last year’s glass-backed device. Anodised aluminium has a finely textured grain that feels great in iPads, and so it does here as well.
Samsung has trimmed down the screen borders too, although there remains sufficient room for your thumbs to rest whether you’re holding the Galaxy Tab S5e on its side or upright. This trim down also makes this 10.5-inch tablet smaller (in most dimensions) than a 9.7-inch iPad.

It’s super-slim at 5.5mm and its 400g weight is light for a 10.5-inch tablet. Slim, trim and light the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e may be, but a tablet with this screen size can only be so petite.
If you’re after a device for young kids, we’d recommend a smaller tablet. Or at least a larger one with the kind of protection offered by a Kindle Fire for Kids.

Would you want to take a tablet of this size on the train? Six years ago, in the golden days of Tesco Hudls and the Google Nexus 7, I’d have said no. But today, when you occasionally see a 12.2-inch iPad on the commute, I’d say why not?. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e is just about light enough to hold in one hand to read an article or comic book.
Note that there’ no headphone jack, though, so you’ll need to use an adapter or a wireless pair of headphones. Not ideal.

The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e has many of the same peripheral features as a mid-range phone. Storage starts at 64GB, which can be upgraded to 128GB for £60. There’s a fingerprint scanner on the side – it isn’t as fast as those found in new phones, but then you’re likely to use it on only a handful of occasions through the day; certainly not as often as on a phone.
You can switch to face unlock if you prefer, which works reliably enough, presumably using the same backroom software as a phone such as the Samsung Galaxy S10. There are Wi-Fi-only and 4G versions, too, costing roughly an extra £100 for the latter.
Samsung offers a keyboard folio accessory for around £115. While I haven’t used this particular unit – Samsung didn’t send one in – I’m not a huge fan of using a tablet such as this as a replacement for a MacBook or Windows laptop; it simply doesn’t offer the same feel.

Screen
For a long time, Samsung was the master of OLED screens in phones and tablets because the company was responsible for making the panels themselves. Several other companies now produce such screens but this is still just about the best you’ll find in a sub-£400 tablet.
It’s a 10.5-inch, 2560 x 1600 AMOLED display with, in my estimation, around 450 nits of brightness. I took the tablet out to a park on a sunny day during the 2019 UK heatwave and the screen remained perfectly visible, enough to play a game comfortably.
Contrast is superb, colour vivid and sharpness excellent. You won’t find a traditional Windows laptop around this price with as capable a display.

In addition, Samsung provides a choice of colour profiles. These are the same as those in Samsung phones and they roughly track with several professional colour standards. The modes are Basic (sRGB), AMOLED Photo (Adobe RGB), AMOLED Cinema (DCI-P3) and Adaptive Display, which unlocks the full native colour spectrum of the screen for eye-popping colour.
The absence of a stylus is the one (potential) major downside. It’s further proof that the S5e is intended to be less of a do-it-all powerhouse than the Galaxy Tab S4.
Software
You needn’t be too put off if that’s what you’re really after, mind, as the Galaxy Tab S5e has a special software mode called DeX. It sits in the notification dropdown and turns the tablet’s Android-based interface into something closer to Windows or Mac OS.
It runs apps in floating windows, makes better use of the screen space and puts more information and shortcuts at your fingertips. You may only want to use DeX if you use a keyboard with the S5e, since it strips away the casual feel of Android. Nevertheless, it makes one of the best arguments going that a tablet can be treated like a “PC” when paired with the right accessory.

Jump out of DeX and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e seems more like a supersized Samsung phone. You have home screens and an apps drawer, which look just like those of the Samsung Galaxy S10, albeit with an extra column of icons in the drawer.
Android doesn’t make great use of larger screens such as this but it’s still a great interface for casual tasks. Fewer apps are forced on you here than by a Samsung phone. The Galaxy Store and Game Launcher are installed out the box but you can choose whether or not to add Samsung’s other apps of your own volition.

Performance, gaming and speakers
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e feels great in use. It’s responsive, with only a marginal speed difference in its Android user experience compared to a phone or tablet with an even more powerful processor.
But what you may not be expecting is that the Tab S5e has a slower CPU than last year’s Galaxy Tab S4, because it’s part of the mid-range “e” series. There’s also a Galaxy S10e phone. It doesn’t have a cut-down CPU compared to the standard S10 but does have a smaller, flatter screen.
The processor of choice here is the Snapdragon 670, instead of the Snapdragon 855 or 855 Plus seen in top-end Androids. What’s the difference? Its cores are less powerful, with two Kryo 360 Gold performance cores and six Kryo 360 Silvers.
GPU power is perhaps more important. The Snapdragon 670 includes an Adreno 615 graphics chipset, which is only half as powerful as the Snapdragon 855’s Adreno 640.
If your budget only stretches to £400, the entry-level iPad is actually a more pertinent comparison. The Samsung scores 1511 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme test (957 using the OpenGL graphics standard). This is way below the iPad, which manages 2611 points.

How does this play out in actual games? Most run very well on the Galaxy Tab S5e. PUBG runs at “high” visuals, and both Asphalt 8 and 9 play without obvious compromise. Ark: Survival Evolved shows up the mid-range GPU, though: max out the visuals and the frame rate becomes jerky.
This matters, of course, it does – but so does context. Currently, there isn’t a tablet that comes with a Snapdragon 855, and most phones with such a processor are significantly more expensive than the Galaxy Tab S5e. Some believed Samsung would announce a no-holds-barred Galaxy S5 tablet with such a processor in August, although it looks like this theory will now materialise as the rumoured Samsung Galaxy Tab S6, instead.
There are other gaming advantages to a Tab S5e over an iPad too. Its speakers are far more powerful, with greater top volume, four drivers and much richer bass. They’re closer in quality to those found on the iPad Pro, and you won’t find a new model of that for under £400.
Camera
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e has one camera on the front and one on the back. Both are fairly basic but have the essentials needed to provide a useful camera experience.
For example, the rear camera doesn’t have a flash, but it does use autofocus. Some low-cost tablets have fixed-focus cameras that won’t let you shoot close-up photos. The sensor here is reasonably fast to shoot, too, and auto-tweaks your images with HDR processing. This stands for ‘high dynamic range’ and stops the brightest parts of an image from looking blown out, while bringing out more detail in the shadows too.

Daylight shots from the primary 13-megapixel camera aren’t too bad, either. But let’s re-align expectations.
This is a solid camera for a tablet. It doesn’t fare too well if you compare it to Android devices in general. Exposure metering is nowhere near as smart as that of Samsung’s best phones, detail is just okay and low-light performance is pretty poor.
  
Manually tweak the exposure and you can capture some reasonable images
The maximum resolution of video capture is only 1080p (Full HD), there’s no 4K mode and while it looks like there’s some software stabilisation, it isn’t particularly effective.
And, as with any 10-inch tablet, shooting photos with a Galaxy Tab S5e just looks a little silly.
Battery life
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e has a 7040mAh battery, just a little smaller than the Tab S4’s 7300mAh cell. Samsung claims it will last an incredible 14.5 hours.
An hour of Netflix streamed at 50% brightness consumed 7%, suggesting full charge stamina of 14 hours. A half-hour of Real Racing took off 6%, indicating that the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e will last for around eight hours of gaming.
Both are great results and actually beat the entry-level iPad.

Should I buy the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e?
In recent years, Samsung’s reaction to a tablet market running on fumes has been to take an Apple-like approach. You could get fairly high-end tablets designed for hybrid-style use, and the low-end options were all pretty depressing.
The Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e is what I’ve been wanting: a mid-priced model with some higher-end touches. You don’t have to sell your laptop to justify the expense but it absolutely isn’t a toy intended to keep the kids quiet.
Until now, the Huawei MediaPad M5 10.5 was your best option among Androids. Now it’s the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e. It has a great screen, excellent speakers, a charming aluminium body and scope for life as a breezy laptop-like computer – if that’s what you really want.
The cameras aren’t dazzling but this is rarely ever true where tablets are concerned. The processor isn’t top-end but the Samsung Galaxy Tab S5e gets by just fine anyway.
Verdict
This is the best mid-priced Android tablet you can buy, but an iPad is more powerful.

The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom boasts flagship internals, an attractive design and a killer camera setup, but does it pose enough of a threat to more established global players like Samsung, Apple and Huawei?
The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom has been a long time coming, with the company first teasing a smartphone zoom camera concept back at Mobile World Congress 2017. The company showcased a follow-up technology demo one year later, which appeared to be part of a nearly complete (but at the time still-unnamed) Reno test device.
Related: Huawei P30 Pro review
The finished article looks to bring some interesting design and hardware elements to the table beyond its titular camera feature; not to mention a new build of the company’s own software and improved Oppo staples, including updated VOOC fast-charging technology.
Update: read our Oppo Rezo Z review
Camera – The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom’s snapper is it’s biggest feature
As its name suggests, the camera is the phone’s biggest selling point. It’s actually a three-sensor arrangement, comprised of the ubiquitous 48-megapixel sensor that the likes of the Xiaomi Mi 9 and OnePlus 7/7 Pro use, a 13-megapixel telephoto sensor and an 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle sensor.

Diving deeper, the 48-megapixel IMX586 features OIS (optical image stabilisation), a half-inch sensor size, an f/1.7 aperture, 26mm focal length, 0.8µm pixels and supports pixel-binning to condense four-times the amount of image data into a more refined final 12-megapixel image. All that image data also plays a part in helping resolve fine detail when zooming in.
Speaking of zooming, the 13-megapixel telephoto sensor sits along the phone’s body, rather than pointing straight out. A unique D-cut periscopic lens rotates its line of sight through 90-degrees. It’s this that helps grant the phone its long-distance vision without adding any significant thickness or a Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom/ K Zoom-style motorised lens onto the back.
Related: Best camera phones
Similarly to its most like-minded rival, the Huawei P30 Pro, the sensor is capable of lossless optical zoom and works in tandem with the phone’s main sensor at higher magnification levels to retain as much detail as possible. The sensor sports an f/3.0 aperture and, like the primary camera, OIS too.
Taken on the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom
Last but not least is the 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide angle lens, which features a short 16mm focal length – one of the two boundaries Oppo uses to define the phone’s 10x zoom capabilities (as it can shoot between 16mm and 160mm at full 20x ‘hybrid’ zoom), there’s no OIS here, however.
Tech specs out of the way, in actual use, the raw image quality that the Reno 10x Zoom captures is encouraging. With so many phones using that 48-megapixel main sensor in 2019, there are plenty of existing samples to compare it against.
Zero magnification
10x zoom
60x zoom – the phone’s maximum zoom level (the Huawei P30 Pro maxes out at 50x magnification)
In the case of the Reno, Oppo’s imaging technicians have done a fantastic job in granting it some of the best quality imagery across the board for a phone using an IMX586 sensor. It pips both the aforementioned Mi 9 and the latest OnePlus phones to the post, based on the consistency it offers.
A testament to the quality of the camera experience, it’s so good that it even gives the Huawei P30 Pro’s similarly impressive photographic setup a run for its money.
While low light shooting on the Oppo isn’t bad (above), it pales in comparison to results from the Huawei P30 Pro (below)

Both have astounding maximum zoom levels and both are versatile shooters. The P30 Pro wins out for its unrivalled low light performance (although the Reno did far better than I’d expected), and generally offers a wider dynamic range. The rest of the differences fall more to preference than empirical superiority.
The Oppo Reno captures shots with a warmer, natural finish compared to the Huawei – making it better suited for those who don’t want photos to look too processed – which is evident with its softer detail capture and the flatter results it tends to produce. It trumps the Huawei in artificial light, with regards to overall composition, even if grain is more prevalent and fine detail is lacking.
Imagery from the Oppo’s camera (above) isn’t as heavily processed and adopts a natural, warmer finish compared to the Huawei P30 Pro (below)

So, while Huawei’s top dog might still clinch it in the eyes of the many (as the brand is far more established in the UK), the savvy few will still undoubtedly appreciate the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom’s superb camera setup.
It’s also important to mention one of the phone’s most distinctive physical features, in its ‘pivot rising camera’ – a wedge-shaped segment of the phone’s top edge that rises up by way of a motor to reveal the phone’s 16-megapixel f/2.0 front-facing camera. It’s here that you’ll also find twin LED flashes – a soft front-facing flash and one meant for use when trying to illuminate shots via the main camera on the back.
Snapping a selfie, using face unlock or relying on the rear flash will all summon the phone’s ‘pivot rising camera’
Selfies are decent but the need to raise this whole module when using the rear flash means I seldom bothered with it, preferring to shoot in Night Mode where possible instead.
Performance and software – The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom’s internals are impressive
If you opened up the Reno 10x Zoom, there’d be no doubting its flagship credentials. Head-turning camera array aside, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset and up to 8GB of RAM promise impressive performance.

Sure enough, in real-world use, there’s little sign of struggle whether you’re just browsing the web, streaming video or gaming. With such comparable fluidity against the gamut of similarly-specced 2019 flagships, the question really falls to whether Oppo will ensure that this phone keeps pace from a software and updates perspective.
Gamers should also take note of this phone’s robust cooling system, which makes use of a copper heat pipe, cooling gel and layered graphite to dissipate heat more efficiently than your average phone.
Speaking of software, the Android 9.0-based user experience has been overlaid with a reworked version of Oppo’s own ColorOS, dubbed ColorOS 6. Aside from the aforementioned algorithmic camera talents, it packs in a number of technologies under the ‘HyperBoost 2.0’ moniker, designed to reduce app load times, system speed and latency when gaming. There’s a dedicated gaming mode with a few notification and performance tweaks on offer too.
While steps have been taken in the right direction since last year’s Find X, ColorOS is still an undeniably heavy-handed overlay. It moves away from standard Android tropes and presents a fairly distinct user experience as a result.
Not everyone may gel with the decisions Oppo has made within ColorOS – how it handles notifications and the style and layout of elements like the quick settings and app search feature, to be specific – but it’s cleaner than it’s ever been and we hope Oppo continues to ease up on the throttle when it comes to trying to define a distinct aesthetic.

5G – The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom has it’s very own 5G version in the Oppo Reno 5G
There’s also the matter of connectivity, which by default includes support for Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and up to 4G+ mobile browsing speeds (depending on your region). If that still isn’t enough to cut the mustard, those willing to pay a premium can live on the bleeding edge by picking up a 5G variant of the 10x Zoom complete with Qualcomm’s X50 5G modem onboard, a.k.a the Oppo Reno 5G.

Beyond the improved data speeds, Qualcomm and Oppo are hoping that the Reno can serve as a flagbearer for 5G in 2019, mainly through demonstrating the benefits of the technology on compatible networks by supporting experiences, such as virtual or augmented reality streaming and multiplayer gaming, anywhere.
Related: What is 5G?
The Reno line was originally teased in partnership with Swisscom, primarily as a result of the phone’s 5G credentials and the newly-implemented 5G infrastructure in the region, but the likes of EE in the UK now offer the Reno 5G as one of the few 5G-capable handsets.
Battery –  The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom boasts a big battery and impressive longevity
To supplement the demands of that high-end chipset (and 5G, where applicable), the Reno 10x Zoom is equipped with a capacious 4065mAh integrated battery. That figure alone should instil confidence out the gate, not just because it’s paired to the phone’s Full HD+ display resolution and use of AMOLED technology.

In addition to AI-driven power management, the 10x Zoom also comes complete with Oppo’s signature VOOC fast-charging technology. While still rated at the same wattage as its predecessor, version 3.0 of Oppo’s VOOC technology addresses the trickle charging state that takes place on a device when trying to fill the last few ounces of its battery’s charge.
As a result of a more efficient algorithm, Oppo has effectively doubled the charging speed during the last stage of battery replenishment, meaning more power, quicker, without sacrificing safety (and apparently, long-term battery health).
The Reno 10x Zoom consistently granted me two days of use, landing it at the more impressive end of the current battery life spectrum. All the more impressive was that this included a whopping 6 hours of screen-on time to boot – that’s Huawei P30 Pro territory.
Design – The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom looks pleasantly clean and premium
It should be clear that Oppo has fit a heck of a lot into the Reno 10x Zoom, but the company should also be commended for the package in which it’s wrapped all this technology too. A metal frame comes sandwiched by rounded Gorilla Glass 5.0 on the back and lightly-pillowed Gorilla Glass 6.0 across the phone’s expansive 6.6-inch display.
The finish is pleasing too, with either a Jet Black or Ocean Green colourway on offer, both of which employ a mix of shiny and textured glass that play with the light in interesting ways.

As far as flagship handsets are concerned, the phone is a lot thicker than the status quo (at 9.3mm) and carries a lot of heft at 210 grams. Despite this, I really enjoyed studying the fit and finish of the 10x Zoom close up.
The body could best be described as a ‘glass tank’, and while the mechanised pop-up camera negates any chance of water resistance, the phone looks premium and feels extremely well put-together.
The company was quick to try and ease concerns about the pop-up mechanism’s reliability by stating that it’s guaranteed to operate as intended for at least five years; based on the premise of the camera being raised on average 100 times a day.
There’s also something called ‘free-fall detection’ onboard, so should the phone slip from your grasp while the front-facing camera is out, it’ll quickly retract before impact to mitigate any real damage to the mechanism or camera hardware inside.

Zero camera bump is another bonus, with the phone boasting a perfectly flat back… almost. While such cleanliness is refreshing, the phone does feature what Oppo calls its ‘O-dot’ – a small ceramic bead set into the rear that raises the phone when on flat surfaces that would otherwise scratch up the main camera arrangement up.
It’s an odd, but decidedly thoughtful inclusion, and despite its questionable name, grants me peace of mind when setting the phone down on a table ‘naked’ when I’d only ever be inclined to do the same with other handsets, so long as they were case-clad.
Screen – The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom has a beautiful notch-free display
The whole reason for the phone’s unusual pop-up camera mechanism becomes clear when you realise the screen is completely devoid of a notch or hole-punch camera and terminates impressively close to the edges of the phone’s body.
Testing high frame rate, high-resolution HDR content on the Reno 10x Zoom was a treat
With bezels that measure just 1.35mm on either side, and a chin of just 3.5mm, the large 19.5:9 aspect ratio Full HD+ AMOLED display dominates the phone’s front – with a 93.1 percent screen-to-body ratio to boot. The technology at play grants great colours and perfectly deep blacks, while testing HDR content also yielded pleasing results.
Oppo has implemented a few extra features into the screen to score it extra brownie points too. For starters, there’s an optical in-display fingerprint sensor, which the company says is twice as fast as first-generation iterations of the technology.
I’d be inclined to agree, but I’d also flag that its reliability and consistency is far behind the tech that companies like OnePlus and Samsung have brought to the table.
Should I buy the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom?
Oppo’s moved away from the premise of its last flagship, with the Reno 10x Zoom serving to showcase absolutely every one of the company’s most innovative and impressive technologies, even at the expense of a little extra thickness and weight.
Taking into account the battery life and the impressive quality of the performance in everything from the camera to the fluidity of the user experience, I think it was the right move to make.
This is a sizeable device that’s great for media lovers, mobile photographers or those who are looking for a Huawei P30 Pro alternative that doesn’t rub the US government the wrong way. So long as you can handle its specific brand of software and some specific design quirks, Oppo’s made an impressively-strong play for one of the better phones of 2019.
Verdict
Oppo has delivered a well-rounded and exciting new flagship that doesn’t do as you might expect. It has the potential to take on some serious camera phone contenders too.

The OnePlus 7 Pro manages to innovate in one of the most competitive technology markets out there while still circumventing convention by undercutting the majority of the competition on cost. Even if wireless charging and water resistance aren't part of the equation, It has one of the nicest displays you'll find on a phone, is a superb performer, offers great battery life and the camera is always improving.



Pros

Oxygen OS user experience
Stunning 90Hz HDR display
Top-notch performance
Great battery life



Cons

Underwhelming cameras
No wireless charging
No water resistance
Large and unwieldy

The OnePlus 7 Pro has the best display currently available on a phone, the latest internals and a design that takes a lot of inspiration from the Samsung Galaxy S10. It’s also the priciest OnePlus phone yet, moving away from the company’s idea of offering high-end specs for a bargain price.
Despite starting life as a plucky underdog, however, OnePlus has had to grow up fast and nothing highlights the momentum the company has amassed like its debut entrants into the phone market for 2019: the OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 7 Pro.
Read our reviews of the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro
The OnePlus 7 Pro is for those who want the best the company has to offer and a phone that packs in enough to compete with the latest rival flagships; devices like the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and Huawei P30 Pro.
OnePlus 7 Pro design brings a new level of attention to detail
The OnePlus 7 Pro looks and feels unlike anything the company has produced thus far. While the standard OnePlus 7 bears more than a passing resemblance to last year’s OnePlus 6T, the Pro model is a wholly different beast.
The lessons that Oppo learnt creating its Find X 2018 flagship may well have played a part in the engineering used by OnePlus’ new star player (as OnePlus uses Oppo’s production facilities to build its phones), based on not just its looks but the way it feels too.
Almost bezel-free
An expansive and near bezel-free curved display stretches across the phone’s front, granting it an impressive 88.6 percent screen-to-body ratio; one of the highest of any current smartphone. Essentially, when looking at the front of the 7 Pro, all you’ll see is screen, especially thanks to the display’s curved edges.
With a curved Gorilla Glass front mirrored by the phone’s curved glass back, the metal frame that sits within this sandwich is decidedly thin, but in spite of this, the phone still feels sturdy and well-built.

There’s still room for OnePlus’ signature physical alert slider along its right side – a defining feature on the company’s phones that lets you quickly switch between ringing, vibrating and silent sound profiles without having to look; it’s a small but important bonus that you’d miss, were it taken away.
With no notch or hole-punch camera to speak of, OnePlus has instead opted for a motorised pop-up front-facing snapper, akin to the one found on the Vivo Nex (although this one looks and feels a lot more robust).
It’s quick enough for face unlocking and, as with every phone that’s integrated such a system, comes with claims of rigorous testing and reliability.

OnePlus states that the phone’s front camera mechanism has withstood some 300,000 actuations during testing, without any sign of lag, slowdown or breakage. There’s fall detection in there too, which will pull the camera back inside the moment the phone detects itself hurtling towards the ground.
Collectively, you should feel comforted by these assurances, but as ever, in the real world, I still have my doubts about the longevity of any moving parts on a phone, especially one a delicate and intricate as a motorised camera unit.
For all the care and attention OnePlus has poured into the aesthetics of the 7 Pro, such beauty does come at a practical sacrifice that some might not be willing to overlook.
For a start, with a 6.67-inch, 19.5:9 display; this is a very big device – OnePlus’ largest ever. It’s almost identical in width to its predecessor but notably taller, plus those narrow metal sides give you less purchase, making one-handed use precarious.
Add to that a complete lack of any one-handed mode within the software and elements at the top of the screen within apps (such as the placement of Instagram’s story ‘bubbles’) require two hands or a risky shimmy up and down the phone’s body to be pulled in reach of a thumb.
There’s also the matter of the finish of the phone. I appreciate OnePlus’ decision to shy away from a boring all-black body, instead offering up three colours at launch (partially tied to different RAM and storage configurations).
For the base 6GB RAM/128GB internal storage SKU your only option is ‘Mirror Gray’ – an understated colourway for those uninterested in flash and flare, or ideal if you’re looking to slap a case on it immediately. This is the closest thing to black on offer from this generation of OnePlus.
Fork out for the 8GB/256GB model and you have the full gamut of colours available to you. Mirror Gray is accompanied by ‘Almond’ – a mix of polished gold metal and an iridescent cream tone set behind glass, similar in styling to a gold iPhone XS. Nebula Blue is arguably the biggest head-turner and the finish that my review unit (pictured) came in.
While all three looks deserve praise for their ‘understated cool’, if you’re planning on going caseless, ergonomics once again come into play. The gloss finish of the Mirror Gray and Almond models backs attract fingerprints as readily as any of their competitors, while the finely-textured glass given to the Nebula Blue model will remain comparatively smudge-free.
The trade-off is that the blue model’s treated rear also lacks grip which, paired with it’s already unwieldy form, pushes the chance of the phone slipping from your fingers way up. While I haven’t asked OnePlus directly, I have no doubt that the 7 Pro’s fancy new screen isn’t cheap to replace. You have been warned.

The OnePlus 7 display is the first truly competitive mobile HDR screen
On a more positive note, that display is nothing short of exceptional. Out the box, it may not be as accurately tuned as some of its rivals’ screens but there are plenty of tools to customise the viewing experience should you wish to tinker around.
The company also lauded the screen’s A+ rating from independent body DisplayMate, before the 7 Pro had even officially launched, just in case there was any doubt about its capabilities.
HDR visuals on 6.67-inch display are stunning
It’s the first time we’ve seen a OnePlus screen transcend above Full HD+ resolution. This Quad HD+ panel is also HDR10 complaint, with approved support for services like Netflix – a popular service that previously only offered limited support for OnePlus devices.
Related: What is HDR?
The ‘Fluid AMOLED’ panel, as OnePlus calls it, gets its name not just from the inky blacks and vivid colours it can push out, but the intriguing 90Hz refresh rate that it supports.
Although you can manually dial it down to 60Hz, as most phones use (or have it jump down when battery saver mode is activated), the 7 Pro’s screen remains fixed at 90Hz. The result is an effortlessly smooth-looking user experience that lends itself perfectly to the idea that this is a cutting-edge handset.
Seeing really is believing, especially as only a handful of other devices offer anything close to what OnePlus has cooked up here.
Apple’s ProMotion technology, along with the Asus ROG Phone‘s OLED and the Razer Phone series’ IGZO displays all have the ability to operate at refresh rates notably higher than 60Hz, but in the smartphone space, the OnePlus 7 Pro might be the most approachable and mainstream handset to showcase such technology.
There are known concerns around the impact on battery life leaving the smooth 90Hz setting on all the time might have, but based on the longevity I experienced without ever switching it off (or rather, down to 60Hz), I’d just enjoy its inclusion and how it elevates acts as simple as swiping around the interface.
The worst thing about the feature? You really notice its absence when using any phone that doesn’t support it.

The display smarts don’t stop there. There’s also the integrated optical in-display fingerprint sensor – an evolution on the feature that OnePlus introduced with last year’s 6T.
This time around, OnePlus has enlarged the sensor’s read area and reduced latency; all I can say is that it feels much faster and more reliable than its predecessor, even if it can still be tripped up by particularly cold or wet hands.

With next-to-no bezel, there’s no notification LED to speak of, so instead light pulses down the curved edges of the display in the corresponding app colour to great effect – a feature that both Samsung and Oppo have used on curved-display laden devices.
OnePlus 7 Pro camera has greater versatility, but is that enough?
OnePlus has kept up with principle imaging trends in the realm of smartphone photography, and the OnePlus 7 Pro makes the same move that many of its contemporaries already have; implementing a triple-sensor on the back.
The 7 Pro’s three-lens arrangement is comprised of a 48-megapixel main snapper with OIS (optical image stabilisation), an 8-megapixel telephoto sensor, again with OIS, that grants the phone 3x lossless optical zoom, while a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle sensor, with an impressive 117-degree field of view, rounds things out.
Related: Best camera phones

OnePlus has worked hard to ensure the hardware is put to good use, with the phone boasting enhanced versions of the company’s Nightscape (version 2.0) scene mode and pixel-binning technology (condensing the image data of four pixels into one to reduce shake and noise) as a result of that huge 48-megapixel main sensor.

The ultra-wide angle sensor lets you fit more in-frame, only adding to the 7 Pro’s photographic versatility.

The quality of the telephoto snapper also left me impressed, with pleasing detail retention. Its narrower aperture means images do, however, suffer in low-light shooting
Main sensor (left), telephoto (right) – drag the white slide bar to compare the two images
As for low-light photography, I was surprised by the results produced by the phone, but not in a good way. OnePlus worked hard to improve the low light capabilities of last year’s OnePlus 6 and 6T, but this new hardware is clearly trickier to tune. As before, we’ll likely see subsequent software updates that rectify the phone’s current low light capabilities which I’m hoping will improve with time.

The newly-updated Nightscape mode certainly helps alleviate general low-light shooting but over-corrects, with hard-hitting sharpening and mismanaged colour correction that give shots an unnatural finish.

For a true deep-dive into this phone’s imaging capabilities, jump over to our full OnePlus 7 Pro camera review.
The OnePlus 7 Pro performance is stunning
The OnePlus X notwithstanding OnePlus isn’t in the business on skimping on performance. When you buy a OnePlus phone, you know you’re getting a top-notch processor and complementary smarts to match. Never has that been truer than with the OnePlus 7 Pro.
I already mentioned the memory and storage options that the 7 Pro is available in, which range from generous to pure excess (with up to an additional £150 in tow) but speed and power are everywhere within the phone’s internals.

The latest and greatest 7nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset takes charge, which is also how OnePlus is able to convert the 7 Pro into the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G – the 5G-capable brother to the standard model that also integrates Qualcomm’s complementary X50 5G modem.
Then there’s the inclusion of Universal Flash Storage 3.0. OnePlus has managed to beat Samsung to the punch after the Korean tech giant had to pull its first foldable, the Galaxy Fold, before launch as a result of engineering and reliability issues.
Related: Samsung Galaxy Fold – The final chapter
With the Fold out of the way, it looks as though the OnePlus 7 Pro will be the first phone on the market to support UFS 3.0, with Samsung following with the rumoured Galaxy Note 10 later into 2019.
The technology is theoretically up to twice as fast when it comes to read and write speeds, which affects everything from app load times to file transfers.
There’s so much powerful hardware here that I can’t find fault with the 7 Pro’s performance, and this new addition only serves to help the 7 Pro take the lead in an area that its pricier competitors still haven’t ventured.
OnePlus 7 Pro battery life goes beyond expectation
The story of speed on the OnePlus 7 Pro doesn’t stop with the phone’s fluid user experience and raw performance; it sports suitably solid fast charging technology too.
We first encountered the company’s Warp Charge feature on last year’s OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition and it’s now become part of the mainstream offering here.
The 30W Warp Charge adapter and complimentary cable are unquestionably sizeable (although the previous generation Dash/Fast Charger wasn’t really any more compact) but the convenience they bring nullifies the hassle of carrying them around.

The 7 Pro’s large footprint means it’s also able to carry a hefty 4000mAh battery within its belly and, with the included Warp Charger, that sizeable cell can be refilled from flat to full in under an hour and twenty. What really impresses is the initial charge rate, however.
A third of the battery can be filled in just 15 minutes and more than a day’s worth of juice can be replenished within 30. Most of the battery can be charged within an hour too, so you never have to wait long to give the 7 Pro a meaningful top up.
While quick in their own right, OnePlus’ fast-charging capabilities are no longer industry-leading; Huawei has instead taken that crown. The OnePlus 7 Pro does also lag slightly behind due to its lack of any form of wireless charging – an absentee feature that the company has explained may never be part of the equation on its devices.

As for longevity, the OnePlus 7 Pro, left me thoroughly impressed. While charging the OnePlus 7 Pro is a lot less painless an experience compared to some phones (I’m looking at you Apple), not having to charge it all was an even bigger win.
I was consistently reaching two days of use and up to 5 hours of screen-on time on a single charge, which is well above most modern phones’ more approachable promised day-long endurance.
If I had flipped the refresh rate down to 60Hz or relied on battery saver mode at all, there’s every chance the phone would have lasted even longer.
Little has changed with OnePlus 7 Pro software, and that’s no bad thing
Android 9.0 underpins the software experience on this generation of OnePlus phones but the company’s OxygenOS overlay (version 9.5.2 as tested) is what you’re actually navigating around. It’s a great tweaked take on base Android that’s slick and clean, easy-to-use and powerful.

Integrated gestures make it easier to summon the notifications and quick settings (particularly useful with the 7 Pro’s tall display), as well as activating features like the camera and the flashlight without ever having to wake the phone up.
‘The Shelf’ is a dedicated space for iOS-like widget placement which keeps things tidy, and there’s a hidden ‘second space’ where you can place apps that you want to hide from prying eyes should you hand your phone to a friend. These are all pre-existing features, however.
Notable new additions for the 7 Pro include an enhanced gaming mode that silences notifications and locks screen brightness down, or by enabling ‘fnatic mode’ the phone directs all CPU, GPU and memory usage to your current gaming session and nowhere else.

The new Zen mode was born from the mindfulness practices of OnePlus’ senior staffers and takes a hard stance on pervasive phone checking by locking down everything, save for emergency calls, incoming calls and camera access, for 20 minutes at a time.
Not even restarting or powering the phone off and back on can you escape out of this experience, so make sure that you’re ready for the break, before committing.

The feature feels like OnePlus’ extension of Android Pie’s native digital wellbeing toolset and as with much of what makes the 7 Pro decidedly OnePlus, it’s an odd inclusion but one that I appreciate nonetheless.
Should I buy the OnePlus 7 Pro?
When I first took delivery of the OnePlus 7 Pro, I wasn’t told how much it would cost (that information came later), and I was a little worried.
This phone is undoubtedly feature-packed, the richest the company has ever made, but its higher price warrants greater scrutiny. Previous OnePlus phones have always been pit against the flagships of the time but the comparative affordability they’ve offered has absolved them of any minor shortcomings that would otherwise have been met with disappointment or beratement.
Even so, the OnePlus 7 Pro still undercuts the majority of the 2019 flagship pack (by several hundred pounds in some cases), meaning I can forgive the absence of features like (certified) water resistance and wireless charging – this phone will still leave you impressed (and with more money in your pocket).
Related: Is the OnePlus 7 series water resistant?
Where Huawei’s P30 Pro takes the cake for smartphone camera and battery ability, the OnePlus 7 Pro’s screen is easily one of the nicest I’ve clapped eyes on, plus OnePlus’ user experience is among the best skinned Android experiences you’ll find out there.
The OnePlus 7 Pro shows that the company is able to grow, bring about meaningful changes and greater competition without losing what makes the brand and its devices so uniquely appealing.

Verdict





























 



The Vodafone Smart V10 is one of the best value smartphones available for around £100. It offers users a wonderfully clean install of Android 9, top notch battery life and an actually usable rear camera. The only minor issues are its slightly low-res screen and under-powered CPU.



Pros

Great battery life
Usable camera
Clean Android install



Cons

Underpowered
No fingerprint scanner or NFC






Key Specifications

Review Price: £105
5.9-inch, IPS, HD+ screen
Snapdragon 429 CPU
3GB RAM
3400 mAh battery
Android 9
13-megapixel with 5-megapixel secondary rear camera, 8-megapixel front camera



The Vodafone Smart V10 is the latest affordable blower from network giant Vodafone. It may not have the wow factor of the Galaxy S10 Plus, but when you consider the fact it’s almost a ninth the cost, it manages to perform admirably well.
If you’re a parent on the hunt for an affordable phone for your kid, or a smartphone user that just needs the basics, then the Vodafone Smart V10 is a top-notch option. For £105 (pay as you go on Vodafone), you’ll get a reasonably decent looking phone that ticks all the boxes a budget phone should. Highlights include above-average battery life and an actually ok dual-sensor rear camera.
But, like all £100 phones, there are a few compromises.
Vodafone Smart V10 design – Decent, but a few corners have been cut
Out of the box the Smart V10 looks pretty darned good considering the price. The dinky bezel and teardrop front camera housing makes it look a little like a stripped-down Huawei P30, which is no bad thing.
The side and rear panel may be made of plastic, but feel solidly built and give the phone a more expensive look than you’d expect from a £100 phone. It’s also thinner and lighter than its arch-rival, the Moto G7 Play.
Having unleashed a rampaging four year old on the V10 Smart I can also personally attest that, despite the use of the less common 2.5D Dragontrail – not Gorilla – Glass to protect the phone’s screen, it is suitably scratch and crack resistant. After said child send the phone flying across a hardwood floor, after realising I didn’t have Frozen, the V10 Smart emerged undamaged.
But upon closer inspection you will spot a few corners have been cut. The biggest being the complete lack of a fingerprint scanner and the use of an older microUSB charge port. The absence of a fingerprint scanner is rare these days, but personally I didn’t find it too annoying after a couple of hours with the phone. There’s also face unlock, which can be used to unlock the phone.

The use of a microUSB is a little more annoying. Most phones, even the budget ones, have made the jump to USB C. Having to switch back to the older, slower, cable standard is a minor, albeit forgivable annoyance.
Other small, but common, cuts have also been made. These include the absence of an IP water resistance rating and NFC connectivity, which means you won’t be able to use it to make wireless payments.
When powering it up you’ll spot that the 5.9-inch screen has a fairly low-res 720 x 1560 (HD+) resolution. If you’re switching from an even moderately more expensive handset you’ll notice the drop in resolution. But considering the fact every phone this price – including the G7 Play – is similarly low res, it’s hardly surprising.
The IPS panel is also fairly well set up. Whites are suitably clean and though blacks can look a little grey, it’s more than immersive enough for basic YouTube and Netflix viewing – though be warned the mono speaker is a little on the weak side. The only minor quibble I have is that its max brightness is a little low, which can make using it outside a little tricky.

Vodafone Smart V10 battery and camera – You won’t do better for the money
Dig under the surface and the Vodafone Smart V10 once again impresses. Despite being cheap, it gets a lot of the basics right. Two of the biggest achievements are its impressive battery life and nicely clean software.
As a rule of thumb I found the Smart V10’s 3400 mAh battery easily lasted around one-to-two days use on a single charge. Regular use entailed using it as my primary work and personal smartphone; taking and making a few calls, listening to music during my commute, watching a couple of episodes of Stranger Things and regularly checking my social media and emails.
During video streaming it lost between 8-10% of its charge per hour on average. Gaming drained it of around 15% per hour. Both these figures are impressive and mean it has more stamina than most of the flagship phones I’ve tested.
The battery life is likely helped by the V10 Smart’s wonderfully clean Android 9 install. Unlike most cheap phones the V10 Smart is blissfully clean of bloatware and duplicate applications, which generally eat up a handset’s battery by running in the background. The only notable addition is a custom parental controls app, which lets you do things like block certain apps and limit screen time.
So far so good? I think so. Trust me when I say the Vodafone V10 Smart is a great first phone for kids, or crash phone for adults, but there’s no getting round the fact for even moderately demanding users, it’s a little under-powered.

Its 3GB of RAM is more than reasonable considering the price, but I’m not convinced the Snapdragon 429 CPU is up for anything more than basic tasks. The phone runs fine for basic web browsing, but crank things up a notch and it quickly struggles. Having multiple apps or web browser tabs open can also lead to a few stutters. PUBG runs, but it is far from a smooth experience, so it’s just worth remembering if your kid’s an avid mobile gamer.
The same is true of the camera app, which can take its time to autofocus or take a photo after the shutter button has been pressed. Being fair to Vodafone, you’ll have the same problems on every smartphone this price.
Otherwise the camera is fairly impressive for the price. Round back you’ll find a basic dual-sensor setup that pairs 13-megapixel autofocus and 5-megapixel fixed focus sensors. In its auto setting the phone can take usable, even nice, photos in regular light.
Snapping around London photos are sharp and clear enough for sharing on social media – something you can’t always guarantee on a phone this price. The panorama mode works fine and, though you’ll pick up artefacts and anomalies viewing them on a big screen, the portrait mode is for the most part ok.
Low light photography is a no go, which is to be expected. Shooting in moderately dim conditions the camera will pick up noise, offer poor dynamic range and generally don’t look great. Again, this is standard for a phone this price and you won’t get better for £100.

You can see a selection of photos taken on the Vodafone Smart V10 below.

  
Should I buy the Vodafone Smart V10?
If you’re a parent on the hunt for your kid’s first smartphone, the Vodafone Smart V10 is a solid choice. The phone offers good build quality, excellent battery life and a clean Android install complete with easy to use parental controls.
If you’re after a festival or crash phone to tide you over until your next upgrade, it’s an equally solid option – though you’ll need to be on Vodafone’s network. The only downsides are that, like every phone this price, performance could be better and its screen is a little low res.

Verdict





























 



With a little bit of tweaking, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE can deliver a premium flagship feel, a fantastically versatile camera and great performance, not to mention a killer Super AMOLED screen.



Pros

Excellent design
Great camera
Snappy performance



Cons

Interface has some quirks
No 3.5mm headphone jack
Mono speaker






Key Specifications

Review Price: £349
19.5:9, 5.97-inch screen with Full HD resolution
Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 processor
6GB RAM
Super AMOLED screen
In-display fingerprint
48MP camera



What is the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE?
The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is a pocketable glass and metal phone that feels and looks like a flagship, and despite an RRP of £349, it can be picked up for under £300 if you shop around. The phone has a 19.5:9, 5.97-inch screen that sports a Full HD resolution, so it’s sharper than the much pricier iPhone XR. 
The Mi 9 SE’s 3070mAh battery is on the small side, on paper, however, given the phone’s midrange power demands, it could go either way. There’s also a Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 processor which, when paired with 6GB RAM onboard, is an impressive spec from a power point of view.
While the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE doesn’t have wireless charging or stereo speakers, as found on flagships such as Google’s Pixel 3, it still delivers an under-display fingerprint scanner and a Super AMOLED screen. The phone’s 48MP camera also features the same sensor used in many of today’s flagships, including the OnePlus 7 Pro.
Design – The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE looks like a flagship
Looking like a 2018 flagship, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is a handsome slice of smartphone. It’s available in three colours – blue, violet and grey – and all look great with their high-gloss finishes. While they do attract fingerprints very readily, fortunately, there’s a case in the box, so you can protect yours from the get-go and keep it smudge-free.
With its 19.5:9 screen that clocks in at under 6 inches, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is long and thin, making it easy to use one-handed. Despite having a bigger screen than a iPhone XS, it still manages to be slimmer and lighter than Apple’s flagship. All the buttons are on the right side of the device. Meanwhile, on the left is a dual-SIM card slot.
With its elegantly rounded, high-gloss metal frame, sandwiched in between two sheets of Gorilla Glass, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE feels slick. It can be a bit slippery – but, generally speaking, can be held snuggly and securely, especially when in its case, and is comfortable for big and small hands alike.

There’s no headphone jack or microSD card slot, and at the base of the phone is a mono-speaker, so it isn’t quite a flagship from an audio point of view. That said, the Mi 9 SE’s USB-C port is a nice-to-have, given the fact the similarly priced Oppo RX17 Neo features a (now dated) micro USB port.
Unlike flagship devices like the Samsung Galaxy S10, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE isn’t IP-rated for water or dust resistance.
Screen – The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE has an impressive Super AMOLED display
The design is near enough best-in-class given the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE’s pricing, and so too is the screen. For starters, this panel is sharp. A pixel density of 432 pixels-per-inch means it’s crisper than the OnePlus 7 and the Huawei P30 Pro.
Better still is the fact the Mi 9 SE uses a Super AMOLED display, complete with a host of colour customisation options within the settings. The display is punchy by default, though can be muted for more natural tones, and produces deep blacks too.
Brightness is very impressive, as are viewing angles, with only slight colour shifting at extreme angles – something most flagship OLEDs suffer from, too.
There’s also a dark mode in the settings to take advantage of depth of blacks the Mi 9 SE’s screen produces, and you can also hide the notch. Frustratingly, rather than go the Huawei route when hiding the notch, still displaying notifications and the time in the blacked out area either side of the selfie camera, hiding it on the Mi 9 SE will simply push the screen down, notifications included, thereby shrinking the screen and totally missing a trick.

In fact, our only real gripes with the screen are from a software point of view. When gaming in full-screen specifically, the Mi 9 SE crops the notch out, but does so without a curve at either corner. This creates an ugly, asymmetrical look – two curved corners, two right-angle corners. Hopefully this will be remedied in a software update. 
Software – The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE runs a future-proof OS with lots of customisation options
Just like the Redmi Note 7, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE runs Android 9.0 with MIUI 10, over the top, also found on the flagship Xiaomi Mi 9.
Running on top of Android Pie, it’s great to see the latest, widely available version of Google’s OS here; both future-proofing the phone and ensuring app support is looking great.
The interface doesn’t offer an apps drawer. Instead, it opts for an iOS-esque setup. Shortcuts and widgets can be organised across your home screens, and to the left of these is a utility display for quick access to features that Xiaomi believes users need to hand. These include tools like a QR code reader and note taker. There’s also a pull-down notifications tray/quick toggle menu at the top of the screen.
The phone features plenty of customisation options throughout its interface. Navigation is controlled by gestures, but you can reinstate the navigation bar, for example. In addition, a customisable power on/off schedule is available, as too is a password-protected virtual “Second Space” for sensitive information.
There are some annoying quirks too, though. For example, every time you install an app, it gets scanned for viruses. While this sounds great, it doesn’t simply scan in the background, it takes you to a different screen, loaded up with ads that are a pain to bypass.

You can remove this feature, and also reinstate an applications tray with a custom launcher, two things we did – after which the experience went from a 60% to a 90%, but if you’re not prepared to tweak the UI to suit you, some elements might get a bit frustrating.
Performance  – The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE boasts impressive power for its price 
With its Qualcomm Snapdragon 712 processor combined with 6GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of storage, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is like a flagship/upper midrange smartphone lovechild. 
The interface was super smooth in our two weeks with the phone, as too were third party apps, and the camera, which shot and played back up to 4K footage without breaking a sweat.
While not flagship-grade, benchmarks still impress for the sub-£300 phone, with its Geekbench multi-core score clocking in at 5968. The Mi 9 SE’s Antutu score was 181768, putting it about on-par with a Pixel 2. This is reflected in gaming, with the phone handling 2D and 3D titles like a champion. There’s no microSD card, which might put some off, but with a capacity of up to 128GB storage, there should be room for all but the most demanding users. Additionally, there’s also a dual SIM card slot. 
The bottom-firing, mono-speaker is as loud as it needs to be, though is very easy to cover up when gaming. The lack of a headphone jack also means you’ll need to have a pair of Bluetooth cans to get the best from it, though it does ship with a headphone jack to USB-C adaptor dongle in the box.

Biometric security comes in the form of facial recognition and an under display fingerprint scanner. In tandem, both work quickly, however, the fingerprint scanner isn’t quite as fast as traditional scanners.
Camera – The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE has a fantastically versatile camera for a mid-range phone
The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE’s triple camera has a virtually identical setup to that found on the flagship Mi 9, a 48-megapixel (f/1.8) primary camera, an 8-megapixel (f/2.4) telephoto camera and a 13MP (f/2.4) ultrawide angle camera. OIS (optical image stabilisation) and laser autofocus are both absent here, but it still impressed us in our time with it.

The primary sensor may be 48 megapixels in resolution but pictures are rendered at 12 megapixels, unless you hit the override switch in 48M mode. This lower-resolution image benefits from pixel binning, a technique that combines information from multiple pixels to create a better, albeit lower-res, image.
In good light, detail captured by the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is superb, though is a touch high when it comes to contrast and saturation. That said, you can drop these defaults in the settings. Pinch into shots you’ve taken, and things hold up well, and this is especially true in the 48MP mode which we’d recommend firing up when lighting conditions aren’t too challenging.
Skies are bright and colourful
Colours can come across very saturated
When HDR is activated, even challenging scenes deliver a healthy amount of dynamic range when captured on the Mi 9 SE. That said, Auto HDR could do with being a bit more sensitive, as it didn’t always fire up when we needed it, so if you don’t see the HDR indicator, remember to override it.
There are also plenty of shooting options. These include Night, Panorama, AI, Portrait and Pro modes. Absent from older Xiaomi phones is the new 48MP mode, taking advantage of the sensor’s high pixel-count, and creating images that can be pinched right into.
In low light, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE doesn’t do too badly. In night mode, it captures atmospheric night shots with slightly bumped up brightness, activating a long exposure shot like the Huawei P30 series. Even in automatic mode, the low light performance is respectable from the main camera.
Night Mode turned on
The telephoto and wide camera both do a decent job in good light, also taking advantage of the auto HDR feature. That said, when the lights drop, we’d suggest avoiding both altogether.
As for the 20-megapixel (f/2.0) selfie camera, it also features auto HDR, so handles backlit scenes better than many midrangers. The Beauty mode isn’t overbearing by default, flattering rather than just flattening subjects. It can also be dialled up and down, which is welcome.
The Beauty Mode isn’t too strong
Detail in selfies is great in good light, but in low light, as noise creeps in clarity naturally drops. On the plus, the screen can double up as a flashlight, which helps things along nicely.
Video is recorded at up to 4K resolution, and this captures a superb level of detail for the price, especially in good light – provided you hold the phone rock steady. While in Full HD, stabilisation is great, despite the lack of OIS, in 4K, it doesn’t seem to fire up. Also frustrating is the fact video doesn’t take advantage of the wide or telephoto cameras, just the primary module.
Battery Life – The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE has a small battery, but it lasts a full day 
The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE’s 3070mAh battery might sound small, but when you consider its sub-6-inch screen size and mid-range power demands, it’s not too surprising it makes it through a full day.
In our tests, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE handled an hour of streaming video, gaming and music playback with the screen off very well, leaving over 60% remaining. In real world use, we were wrapping up with about 20% left in the tank by 9pm, with 6am starts and moderate use.

There are also a range of battery optimisation options within the settings to eke out even more battery life from the Mi 9 SE – and if you do fall short before the day is done, it supports 18W fast charging, shipping with a compatible charger in the box.
Should I buy the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE?
The Xiaomi Mi 9 SE is a small, premium smartphone with a very good camera and ample power under the hood, given its price. While its RRP is in the £350 region, you can pick it up for significantly less than £300 if you shop around. 
This means it competes directly with the likes of the Nokia 8.1, a significantly worse phone in almost every respect, despite the fact it runs with a cleaner interface.
Alternatively, the Huawei P30 Lite is a great looking ‘affordable flagship’ that delivers a similar look to the Mi 9 SE, but it pales in comparison from a power point of view.
You could even stump up the extra and pick up the Google Pixel 3A for a stock, mid-range experience complete with a stellar single camera. That said, it doesn’t have the versatility of a zoom lens or an ultra wide-angle camera, and the Mi 9 SE feels significantly more premium in the hand.
Ultimately, therefore, while the Mi 9 SE might not be perfect in every respect, you probably won’t get more for less in a premium, pocketable package.
Verdict
With a little bit of tweaking, the Xiaomi Mi 9 SE can deliver a premium flagship feel, a fantastically versatile camera and great performance, not to mention a killer Super AMOLED screen.

The Sony Xperia 1 doesn’t play by the rules set out by the Samsung Galaxy S10, Huawei P30 Pro and iPhone XS. By doing things differently, it focuses on a different audience and – ultimately – (mostly) impresses.
This isn’t a mainstream phone and it certainly isn’t for everyone. For example, the 2:1 aspect ratio display makes for an unwieldy handset that takes some getting used to. However, I can’t help but be impressed by the fact that Sony has tried to do something different – and mostly succeeded.
Yes, the Sony Xperia 1 display is 4K, OLED and HDR – It still isn’t the best out there, though
Sony has included 4K screens on its devices in the past, starting with the Xperia Premium and continuing with the XZ2 Premium. Neither of those panels really used that resolution to its true potential, though – and, ultimately, it felt like wasted tech that jacked up the price of an average phone.
Things are far more positive here. The most notable upgrade is the switch from LCD to OLED, providing better contrast, perfect blacks and generally richer colours. 
The aspect ratio, too, moves from the 18:9 that you’ll find in many other flagships to 21:9. This stretched-out aspect ratio makes for a very tall phone, but also one that’s ideal for content shot at 21:9. It’s a shame then that content actually made for this screen is lacking; you’ll usually find yourself stretching out regular 16:9 or 18:9 footage to fill the whole screen (unless you’re happy with black bars, that is).
Some of Netflix’s original content is shot at 21:9, which is great, but even on a screen such as this I’ve found it difficult to become fully immersed in a film when it’s only 6.5 inches wide. I’m more likely to watch a few YouTube clips or short TV episodes, but these don’t look as good. You’re likely to appreciate the Sony Xperia 1 more if you like watching movies on phones.

The 4K and HDR support is a little confusing. HDR content is available through Netflix and Amazon Prime with the correct subscription and it looks great, while YouTube will play content in both 4K and HDR (again, if the video supports it). Now, Sony reps told me Netflix and Amazon will both play content in 4K – but, for me, they don’t. Amazon limits even 4K content to 1080p (it shows a 1080p badge in the bottom corner) and Netflix seems to do the same.
I’m not even convinced that much resolution is required on a phone with a 6.5-inch display. Playing a 4K video on YouTube next to 1440p content on a OnePlus 7 Pro and Galaxy S10 didn’t reveal much extra detail. In fact, I preferred how the image was presented on the none-4K phones thanks to the more familiar aspect ratio.
The Sony Xperia X1 can’t compete with the best in the business in terms of pure display quality, either. While colour gamut, brightness levels and such are fine – I’ve achieved more complete results from competing Android devices. You can see a full breakdown of this on our Sony Xperia 1 screen review page.
There are two screen modes on the Xperia 1: a “Creator” mode and a “Standard” mode. By default the phone is in Standard; however, Creator mode aims to “provide a faithful reproduction of the creator’s intended vision”. The Creator mode is softer on the eyes, displays a more orangey hue, and doesn’t present as much of an artificial tone.
There’s plenty going on with this display, and depending on the tasks for which you use the phone, you’ll either love it or just wish for something a little more mainstream. It isn’t the most accurate display around, but it’s good for watching media, especially content that’s made for this 21:9 screen.
Xperia 1 design is different, with the 21:9 aspect ratio making it taller than the competition
While the tall 21:9 display has its benefits for certain types of videos, I don’t think the trade-off for usability in worth it. This is certainly true for me; your mileage may vary and, depending on how you use your phone, it might actually offer an improvement.
The Xperia 1 is the tallest mainstream phone I’ve used. Line it up next to other large flagships such as the iPhone XS Max, OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and it sticks out as the odd one out. Yet, it doesn’t feel as big as those phones as it’s narrower. This means while it’s virtually impossible to move your thumb from the bottom to the top, overall the phone is easy to grip and doesn’t feel at all like it’s going to fall out of my hands.
There’s a fingerprint sensor on the side
Still, there are some odd design choices here. The biggest in my opinion is the sheer number of buttons along the device’s right side: camera shutter, fingerprint sensor, lock key and a long volume rocker. I’m completely for these side-mounted fingerprint sensors, and the one here is super-quick and far superior to any in-display alternative, but it needs to incorporate the lock switch, too, as it does on the Samsung Galaxy S10e and Honor 20 Pro. 
Along the top is a SIM and microSD slot, while the USB port for charging sits along the bottom edge.
It’s a well-built phone that has soft, curved edges and a light body. It feels far more “plasticky” than the iPhone XS or Samsung Galaxy S10, for example. However, as a result of this it feels less delicate, too: I’ve already dropped the Xperia 1 a couple of times and it’s barely picked up a scratch. Drop the iPhone XS once and you’ll certainly see some shards of glass.
The Xperia 1 software does a good job at making the tall display make sense
To really put that tall display to good use, Sony has heavily tweaked its Android skin. There’s much focus on easy multitasking, with that extra screen real-estate giving you more room than normal to have two apps sitting side-by-side.
Multitasking here still leaves you with fairly small portions of each app to use, but you can cram in more – in a more usable way – than you would on a phone with a squatter, wider screen.
App support, in general, is fine with the new aspect ratio. You won’t find many apps that don’t automatically resize – although it’s more common to see black bars running down either side of the panel in certain games – and you have the option to manually stretch video in apps such as Netflix and YouTube.
Some of the less convincing software tweaks come in the form of a number of Sony feature brought from the previous Xperia XZ3 flagship. Side Sense, in theory, allows you to tap the sides of the phone to initiate a number of actions including a pop-up app menu and to shrink the homescreen into a one-handed mode. In practice, it’s doesn’t work properly. Sometimes, it will burst into life with the slightest touch; other times, it doesn’t respond to even a hard jab.
Another Sony software addition is Dynamic Vibration – and it’s about as successful as Side Sense. The idea here is that this system adds haptic responses not only when you receive messages or calls, but when there’s sound playing from a video or game. I have to say it’s super-odd trying to immerse yourself in a film whilst having the phone spew out random vibrations. Even with the vibrations turned down to their lowest it was an annoyance.
The Android UI is nice and clean, even if there’s plenty of bloatware
Thankfully, Sony has refreshed its once-ugly Android UI, turning it into very much a tweaked version of the software you’ll find on a Google Pixel. Of course, it’s still home to plenty of useless bloatware, but the overall look is slick and clean. I like the introduction of swipe gestures to pull down the notification panel (required on a screen this tall), and you can switch back to the traditional set of three Android soft-keys if you want.

The Sony Xperia 1 camera setup is the best of any Sony phone so far, if not quite the overall king
The Xperia 1’s triple-camera system gives it the photographic firepower to compete with its flagship rivals, although it doesn’t quite blow them out of the water.
Three cameras sit on the back
Alongside the main 12-megapixel camera, which has a bright f/1.6 aperture, there’s a 52mm option for 2x optical zoom, plus a handy 16mm wide-angle lens for squeezing that soaring architectural masterpiece into your shot.
The Xperia 1’s strengths are shooting pleasingly natural daylight shots, impressive portraits and stabilised 4K video. 
Its Eye AF feature (taken from Sony Alpha cameras) works well, without making a dramatic difference to your snaps, while the distortion correction option on its wide-angle photos makes that mode much more useful than on other phones.

Sony Xperia 1 (left) vs Google Pixel 3 (right) (use the slider to jump between the two sample photos)
The Google Pixel 3 and Huawei P30 Pro are still better all-rounders for daily shooting. The Pixel 3’s auto-HDR processing remains the best around, while the P30 Pro has 5x optical zoom. Note that the Xperia 1 lacks any kind of night mode for getting usable results when the lights are down.
Still, shots from Sony’s flagship might be more to your taste if you prefer subtler image processing. And it’s one of the best phones for shooting video, particularly if you like tinkering with colour-grading or pulling focus while shooting.
Its combination of optical and electronic stabilisation works very well for handheld walking videos, while the Cinema Pro app gives you various levels of control (manual focus, shutter speeds, pro ‘looks’ like Venice CS) that you can’t really find elsewhere.
The Xperia 1’s camera experience could do with a little extra polish and consistency. The manual mode, for example, is only available on the main 26mm camera, and annoyingly you don’t get Eye AF on the front camera, where it could prove most useful.
But the photographic experience is a real improvement on previous Xperia phones and makes the Xperia 1 a powerful all-rounder to have in your pocket for both stills and video.

Sony Xperia 1 performance is as good as other 2019 flagships – although don’t expect 5G support
5G is the buzzword of the moment. EE’s next-gen mobile network is live in the UK, with Vodafone following in July and Three confirmed to hit before the year is up. 5G phones are here, too: OnePlus 7 Pro, LG V50 ThinQ and Samsung Galaxy S10 5G all take advantage of the faster speeds. While Sony teased a 5G phone earlier in the year, the Xperia 1 is plain-old 4G LTE capable.
Related: 5G in the UK
It’s high-end in other ways, though. There’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chipset running the show, backed by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (expandable via microSD) – all pretty run-of-the-mill stuff for 2019.
These are speedy specs with performance to match, although I’d be disappointed with anything less. Coming over from the OnePlus 7 Pro with its ridiculously fast 90Hz display, the Xperia 1 does feel slower when scrolling – but then that’s the case for every phone I use. Would I take that higher refresh rate over fancy extras such as a 4K display? Yes, without a moment’s hesitation. The addition of 4K doesn’t make too much difference, whereas that jump from 60Hz to 90Hz impacts everything you do on the phone.
There’s no headphone jack – hardly a surprise in 2019 – so it’s a benefit that the Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers offer a good hit of sound. Call quality is strong, too, and the mics do an excellent job of cancelling out excess background wind and noise.
Performance is comparable to other flagships
Does a “small” battery lead to poor Xperia 1 battery life?
Many of the 2019 flagship phones we’ve seen so far have come packing huge batteries. You have the OnePlus 7 Pro and Huawei P30 Pro whose cells hit 4000mAh, and I’d expect the upcoming Note 10 to match that. It might seem odd, then, that the Xperia 1 comes with a 3300mAh battery – especially when there’s that 4K display to power.
After using the Xperia 1 for a couple of weeks it’s clear that the battery isn’t terrible; but it isn’t great, either. I’d put it on par with the smaller Samsung Galaxy S10, which normally gives me between three and four hours of screen-on time per day. I’d class myself as a heavy user (it comes with the job…), so depending on your usage – and really how much content you watch on the display – this will vary significantly. An hour of HDR Netflix streaming consumed 12%, which is higher than I’d have expected.
There’s no wireless charging here, which is a real shame. The handy nature of just being able to pop a phone down on a Qi-enabled pad and have it juice up is something that’s difficult to be without once you’ve become used to it. There’s no special form of fast-charging – such as OnePlus Warp Charge or Oppo’s Super VOOC – either. Instead, Sony has opted to utilise the USB PD standard. I like this approach since it allows you to fast-charge the phone with any number of USB-C chargers. A full charge takes around 90 minutes (roughly the same as the Samsung Galaxy S10).
Should I buy the Sony Xperia 1?
The Xperia 1 is directly aimed at fans of the iconic Sony brand and those bored with the current state of similar-looking smartphones. It does thing differently – for better or worse.
There’s no doubt this is the best camera Sony has ever put on a phone and it’s the finest display I’ve seen on an Xperia phone, too. That being said, the Pixel 3 still has a better camera and the OnePlus 7 Pro a better display.
Unlike previous Xperia phones, there’s nothing to seriously put me off the Xperia 1. The battery life isn’t world-beating, but it’s fine; the software is much cleaner than it used to be; plus I appreciate the physical fingerprint scanner. In my opinion, the only true missing feature is wireless charging.
Verdict
The best Sony phone in years and a unique approach that should deservedly win fans.

Verdict





























 



This is a steady, slightly predictable update to the OnePlus 6T that is clearly trying to entice those who haven’t updated in a few years. If you’re coming from a OnePlus 3T or even a 5 or 5T, then the difference should feel significant. This is a great value phone that’s a strong competitor to the excellent Xiaomi Mi 9.



Pros

Oxygen OS user experience
Top-notch performance
Great battery life



Cons

Lacks Pro's camera versatility
No wireless charging
No water resistance

The OnePlus 7 Pro might be the company’s headline-grabbing handset this year but it wasn’t alone at launch. The standard OnePlus 7 is also here, looking to entice those with tighter purse strings to the latest generation of the company’s phones.
The OnePlus 7 bridges the gap between last year’s OnePlus 6T and this year’s 7 Pro, utilising different bits from the two devices to create a handset that takes on the likes of this year’s Xiaomi Mi 9 and Asus ZenFone 6.
Read our reviews of the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro
While the 7 still aims to offer a flagship experience at a fiercely competitive price, unlike previous OnePlus phones, it doesn’t try quite as hard as the ‘Pro’ model. On the one hand, this means it lacks features that help it stand out quite as much, on the other, it starts at £150 less than the beefier OnePlus 7 Pro.
The OnePlus 7’s camera is still a big upgrade
That main camera on the back of the 7 is fronted by a 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor. It’s become a wildly popular component on many current mid-to-high-end phones, meaning its capabilities hinge on OnePlus’ ability to deliver competent software to complement the hardware at play.
Despite the megapixel count, the OnePlus 7 takes 12-megapixel stills by default through a process called ‘pixel binning’. Basically, it treats four standard pixels as one large pixel, allowing more light in for use in the resultant 12-megapixel shots that it captures.
Of course, a keen eye will spot that the back of the 7 lacks at least one member of the 7 Pro’s camera setup, but it takes things further, with only a 5-megapixel depth sensor accompanying that main 48-meg snapper – in place of the Pro’s ultra-wide and telephoto sensors.

Overall, picture quality holds promise, and provided you’re OK with the lack of versatility compared to the Pro model, it makes for a decent all-round cameraphone. Its a definite improvement over the 6 and 6T, which themselves already demonstrated more competent image handling from OnePlus’ photography team.

Shots pack in plenty of detail, impressive dynamic range and pleasingly rich colour.

As for low light shooting, the OnePlus 7’s capture capabilities have unquestionably been improved (presumably via software tweaks) since the OnePlus 7 Pro’s initial launch, where the 48-megapixel camera left a lot to be desired. There’s still noise and grain in the darkest of areas but it’s far less invasive, while fine detail retention is surprisingly good.
Things, for the most part, get even better when you activate the phone’s Nightscape mode. It’s not going to give Google’s Night Sight cause for concern but in its own right, it’s a great boon when taking snaps under tricky lighting conditions.
Nightscape 2.0: Off (left), on (right) – drag the white slide bar to compare the two images
You can expect noticeably better colour capture and dynamic range, plus most of the aforementioned noise gets ironed out in the process too. However, this all comes at the expense of fine detail, with heavy-handed smoothing rounding out the edges of intricate aspects of a scene.
Portrait mode: Off (left), on (right)
Portrait mode is also suitably solid. There’s definite smoothing when flipping the mode on, even without virtual beauty mode activated, while dynamic range appears a touch wider, with more colour variation and higher saturation, especially across the face.
The depth effect – or bokeh – looks pleasingly natural, I just wish I had to option to adjust how strong the effect was, either at the point of capture or after the fact, a common ability among many competitors.
The OnePlus 7 packs the latest processor, lots of memory and a big battery
Despite its slightly lesser standing compared to its bigger brother, make no mistake, the OnePlus 7 is equipped just as well as any other top-tier flagship.
Numbered OnePlus phones have always been powered by the latest silicon from Qualcomm, and while the continuation of this trend was never in doubt for the top-end Pro, there was a chance that we could have seen the cheaper 7 ship with a mid-range CPU instead. Thankfully, that’s not the case here.
 The OnePlus 7 packs the same Snapdragon 855 processor, paired to either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. The result is a phone that in my testing, came out near the very top of our current benchmarking tests, vying for the lead against the likes of the Black Shark 2, iPhone XS and, unsurprisingly, the OnePlus 7 Pro.

Related: Best smartphone 2019

As you’d expect from a phone running this chipset, it’s very fast. OnePlus has always ensured that its phones have felt as snappy as possible, and that’s most certainly the case here.
Storage starts at a generous 128GB too, but you can splurge for the beefier 256GB if you prefer. As is usual with OnePlus phones, there’s no expandable storage but with so much internal space for the price, most users won’t have to worry about it becoming a limitation.

A lot of this performance comes from Oxygen OS, which remains my personal favourite reskin of Android. This is in part thanks to how faithfully it shadows Google’s own take on the Android user experience, augmented by a few smart additions that elevate things in terms of convenience and flexibility.
Some of the latest features are also some of the most memorable, with built-in screen recording now natively onboard, Zen Mode for completely blocking out notifications for 20-minute stints and the new Fnatic mode, which frees up the phone’s resources to ensure your gaming experience is as smooth as can be.
There’s also a 3700mAh battery inside that uses the same Fast Charge technology that we’ve seen for a few generations of OnePlus now.
The phone’s big battery was able to get me through two days of regular use and, while my initial test was an anomaly, the 20W fast charger was able to refill the OnePlus 7 in under 90 minutes, with almost half of the battery (47%) full after just 30 minutes.
The OnePlus 7 shares its design and screen with the 6T, and that’s no bad thing
If OnePlus has taken the internals and camera from the 7 Pro, then it’s taken the design and display from the OnePlus 6T.
Visually, the OnePlus 7 looks near-identical to the OnePlus 6T. The front keeps the dewdrop notch, the back feels like a slippery pebble and there’s no headphone jack. There’s also no wireless charging or official IP rating for water resistance. Considering the £499 price though, I’m not complaining too much.

If you inspect the 6T and the 7 side by side (as I did), you’ll notice that the company’s signature alert switcher, which serves as a physical toggle between ‘ring’, ‘vibrate’ and ‘silent’ profiles, is notably smaller on the newer 7. The earpiece grille, meanwhile, concealed into the top edge of the phone above the dewdrop notch of that 16-megapixel front camera, is much wider.
The new alert switcher is perfectly pleasing to use and may potentially offer better grip as a result of its lesser height, while the earpiece led me to believe that it’d be easier to hear recipients on the other end of a phone call.
In truth, it takes a little searching to find the earpiece’s sweet spot, so the extended design must only serve to differentiate between the old and new phones, albeit solely on a cosmetic level.

The 6.4-inch FHD+ might not match up to the glorious Quad HD+, 90Hz Fluid AMOLED panel you’ll find on the OnePlus 7 Pro, but it’s still a great display. Colours are punchy, there’s a decent array of screen modes (P3, sRGB etc.) and as it’s OLED you get perfect, deep blacks.
The in-display fingerprint has also been tightened up, which is a good thing considering how sluggish it felt before.
Should I buy the OnePlus 7?
This is a steady, slightly predictable update to the OnePlus 6T that is clearly trying to entice those who haven’t updated in a few years. If you’re coming from a OnePlus 3T or even a 5 or 5T, then the difference should feel significant.
If you’re going to be upgrading from the OnePlus 6 or OnePlus 6T the updates are less immediately obvious. The camera will be better and the performance should be too, whether the improvements will warrant an upgrade remains to be seen though.
That aside, however you look at it, this is a great value phone that’s a strong competitor to the excellent Xiaomi Mi 9.

Verdict




























 



If you want a cheap, durable device to play and consume Amazon’s vast array of Prime content then the Amazon Fire HD 10 will fit your needs. It isn’t revolutionary or overly interesting, but it will get the job done. If you’re not deep inside the Prime ecosystem, or simply want a tablet that can be productive, then you should look elsewhere.



Pros

Good screen
Cheap
Great if you love Amazon content



Cons

You really need Amazon Prime
Poorly placed buttons

What is the Amazon Fire HD 10?
Amazon has since updated its flagship tablet. You can read our full Amazon Fire HD 10 (2019) version here. 
The Amazon Fire HD 10 is the largest and priciest member of the company’s Fire tablet range, sharing in the values of its predecessors in terms of affordability but also bringing new features like a 1080p display. 
This affordable slate is ideal for those who’ve bought into Amazon Prime, although if you’re not familiar with the company’s ecosystem, the user experience might be a tad jarring at first. It’s also a good buy if you want to read Kindle books, but want a device that does a little more than the Kindle Paperwhite or Kindle Oasis.
 10-inch tab too big for your needs? Amazon’s more compact Fire HD 8 packs many of this device’s feature but in a more compact shell.
Amazon Fire HD 10 – Design
Compared to the majority of similarly-sized slates, the Amazon Fire HD 10 comes in with a footprint that’s larger than most.
After using the HD 10 for more than a few minutes, it’s easy to see why 10-inches is not the go-to size for most tablets. 10-inch tablets like the Fire HD 10 just feel awkward, especially when you try to use them out and about. The HD 10 suffers particularly badly from a top-heavy form and trying to hold it to read books just isn’t a comfortable experience.

So why am I throwing such criticisms at the HD 10 when the likes of Apple’s 9.7-inch iPad might not endure the same scrutiny? The Fire HD 10 is styled as a widescreen tablet, toting a 16:10 aspect ratio. Larger tablets with such proportions always feel more cumbersome than a slate that opts for a more approachable 4:3 aspect ratio or something similar. With this in mind, the Fire HD 10 is best kept for use in the home.
The design of the Amazon Fire HD 10 appears to prioritise ease of engineering over comfort, aesthetics or ease-of-use. All the controls and ports lie along the top face – a trait it shares with so many cheap, unbranded tablets.
This isn’t hugely practical. Held upright it means the controls are out of easy reach and when the device is held in a landscape orientation, your hand will always rest over either the power or volume buttons. 
Compromise is a common theme here. While there’s a metal frame inside the Amazon Fire HD 10 that helps to stop it flexing – under normal pressure, it doesn’t flex at all – on the outside, it’s covered in matte plastic. Overall, it just feels a little cheap.
Nevertheless, if you’re picking up the Fire HD 10 for the kids to happily chuck around, or keep entertained on long journeys, it fits the bill perfectly.

Amazon Fire HD 10 – Screen
The most obvious upgrade to the new version of the Fire 10 is the screen. No longer is it a terrible 10.1-inch 1280 x 800 blur-fest, but a perfectly respectable 1080p display.
The IPS panel offers decent viewing angles and colours displayed onscreen are nice and bright but it lacks the deep blacks and pop of saturation that an OLED panel can offer. Nevertheless, for a tablet that costs £150, it remains quite impressive.
Movies streamed from Prime Video or Netflix look good, and text in Kindle books is crisp enough to comfortably read for long periods. I do find the whites a tad bright, often with a yellow tinge – but once again, it’s forgivable at this price.

This is a huge jump forward from the older model.

Verdict




























 



The Asus ZenFone 6 is certainly intriguing, thanks to its revolving camera module and impressively large battery, but there's stiff competition out there that might undercut the otherwise promising value for money on offer here.

If you like the makeup of the ZenFone 6 specifically, there isn't much else that compares, however, it doesn't really excel in any one area.



Pros

Well-implemented unique camera setup
Good, bright notch-free HDR display
Well-executed user experience
Exceptional performance
Clean design



Cons

Underwhelming battery life (considering capacity)
So-so camera quality
Minor software bugs
No water resistance
Thick and heavy

Asus has reimagined the ZenFone 6 in 2019 as a powerful new flagship Android smartphone with a focus on performance, battery life and a unique rotating dual camera.
Having spent a few weeks with the phone, it’s interesting to see what Asus has tried to do here. It’s sprinkled in a couple of headline capabilities, used on-trend design elements and given it a price that justifies the absence of any features that more expensive flagships still possess.
On first impressions, this recipe feels like it works. However, dive a little deeper and there’s still a question mark over whether it’s collectively enough to convince you, the buyer, to throw your cash towards the Taiwanese tech giant’s new handset over more costly but more capable alternatives.
The Asus ZenFone 6 performs acrobatics to avoid using a notch
Notches, sliders, hole-punches, pop-ups – manufacturers have turned to all sorts of different methods and mechanisms in an effort to remove or conceal every element on the front of their devices that isn’t the display. In the case of the new ZenFone 6, it’s safe to say Asus has taken an outside-the-box approach to such a challenge.

The phone’s dual rear camera array sits high on the phone’s curved Gorilla Glass back, while on the front there’s no Samsung Galaxy S10-style hole-punch camera, certainly no notch and no OnePlus 7 Pro-esq pop-up snapper either. Instead, the rear camera module revolves around the top edge of the phone to face forward at the tap of a virtual button.

On the upside, this means you have the might of the phone’s primary cameras at your disposal, even when snapping selfies. As demonstrated during launch and in my subsequent testing, watching 4K 60fps electronically-stabilised footage compared against the lesser front-facing video that the likes of the Galaxy S10 was able to muster, was pretty impressive.
On the subject of Samsung, it too has produced a phone with a rotating rear camera arrangement that doubles as the front-facer – the Galaxy A80 – Asus’ implementation is a little different, however.

The ‘flip camera’ (Asus has designed a rather swish logo to support this self-explanatory branding) as the company calls it, is housed within what it promises is a highly durable liquid metal housing, which is supposedly four times stronger than stainless steel.
The whole housing is then linked to a custom 13-piece gear system and has to squeeze some 32 signal cables and 17 power cables through a 2mm opening in the side of the module, into which the phones camera’s and various sensors reside.

It all seems rather precarious, especially when you peek at the inner workings of the mechanism, as Asus showed during the phone’s launch in Valencia. As with OnePlus and Oppo before it – two companies who’ve also had to prove the technical reliability of the mechanised parts on their smartphones – Asus threw some numbers out in an effort to offer peace of mind to curious would-be buyers who might still sit on the fence.
The flip camera is tested to 100,000 actuations, which Asus equated to five years of intense use, assuming you were snapping in the region of 28 selfies a day. While this should instil confidence, as only the most extreme of narcissists would be able to approach such a frequency, this doesn’t account using it for face unlock or other use cases the company pushed, like vlogging, which is something to bear in mind.
Beyond revolving the camera around for a selfie, you also have the option to orient the snapper setup anywhere through its 180-degree range of motion. With this, you can pull off auto-panoramas – where the cameras move but the phone doesn’t – or take timed shots by setting the phone down on any flat surface while the cameras are positioned at 90-degrees.
The panorama feature is a snappier alternative to a traditional panorama mode, where you have to awkwardly rotate slowly on the spot to capture the vista before you. The ZenFone 6’s implementation means you only have to hold the phone steady for a couple of seconds as it builds an image, although I found it best to hold the phone lengthways to avoid seeing my own face at the end of each capture every time.

Asus has even programmed in a dedicated camera control UI element so you can move it around from within third-party apps like Instagram and Google Lens; the feature works surprisingly well, and I’m yet to find an app with camera access that doesn’t play nice.
The Asus Zenfone 6 camera hardware is made or broken by software
Sony’s sizeable 1/2-inch 48-megapixel IMX586 is the main camera sensor on the ZenFone 6, but it’s also found on the Honor View 20, Xiaomi Mi 9, OnePlus 7, OnePlus 7 Pro, Motorola One Vision, the aforementioned Samsung Galaxy A80 and a bevvy of other devices to boot.
It’s a popular component for good reason but seeing it in use across so many devices from so many different manufacturers does highlight the importance of competent algorithmic image processing.

Some modes and features, like Portrait and RAW capture, are available whether you use it as a front or rear camera, while others, such as Super Night, only apply when it’s serving as the phone’s main snapper.
It’s also accompanied by a 13-megapixel ultra-wide angle sensor, which boasts an impressively-broad 125-degree field of view, complete with software-based distortion correction. It’s this secondary sensor that helps with depth data for portrait shots too.

As with even the most affordable phone cameras, an abundance of natural light always lends itself to well-defined snaps. Pictures look really nice under such conditions, with accurate colours, good detail and a pleasing sense of depth.

However, in some situations, namely macro shots, there’s noticeable aberration at the edge of frame (see above), meaning only centre-framed subjects remain sharply in focus. The issue isn’t always present, so it’s worth checking your shots before you’re done with your subject.


As scenes push towards higher contrast, it doesn’t take long for the ZenFone’s dynamic range, or lack thereof, to make itself known.

Shots look like they’ve been contrast-boosted beyond a level that could be considered, either under-exposing the overall image, leaving dark tones appearing almost completely black or over-exposing, pushing some of the brightest tones and colours into flat white, washing the overall image out in the process.
 Ultrawide sensor (left), main sensor (right)
It’s also worth noting that while the inclusion of that ultra-wide angle camera lets you grab more dramatic shots than the main camera, the sensor used is nowhere near as capable, often revealing noise in the darker areas of frame – even when the overall shot is taken in abundant light.
 Ultrawide sensor (left), main sensor (right)
It also lacks fine detail when compared to the main sensor (despite capturing higher-resolution images), making wide-angle shots far less usable outside of the likes of Facebook and Instagram.

Ultrawide (above). Night mode: Off (left), on (right) 
When the lights go down, there’s next to no point in using anything other than the phone’s night mode. Standard low light shots aren’t awful but you’re far less likely to run into image blur or hand shake issues and noise reduction is far better.

Results don’t compare to the likes of Google’s Night Sight but, as I said, they make otherwise unusable shots usable.

I’ve already spoken about the flip camera’s well-implemented auto-panorama feature, however, the results can be a little more hit and miss. The overall results are good but crop in at all and you’ll see that it picks up handshake all too easily.

I was, however, impressed with how well the phone dealt with the high-contrast conditions of Piccadilly Circus by night, even if its aforementioned narrow dynamic range is again visible.
Touches of style, but the Zenfone 6 design is mostly functional
Thanks to its efforts with the camera, the flat 6.4-inch ‘NanoEdge’ display really does dominate most of the phone’s front. It’s protected by Gorilla Glass 6 and after passing a slight lip, meets with a rounded and chamfered aluminium frame that runs the entirety of the phone’s edge.

On the back is more Gorilla Glass, this time curved; granting the phone a comfortable-but-sturdy feel (supported by its notable 190-gram weight). The Midnight Black model I’ve been trialling boasts touches of blue – seen on the Asus logo and accented on the metal power key. There’s also a ‘Twilight Silver’ variant that sports a gradient back not dissimilar from the one found on the ‘Sky Blue’ Honor 10 Lite.
Above the power key, there’s a volume rocker and a dedicated Smart Key, which by default summons the Google Assistant but can be programmed to activate other features, like changing sound profiles, taking a screenshot or toggling the flashlight on and off.
It’s an appreciated addition for sure, especially as it also doubles as a physical shutter key when using the camera, however, its placement, high on the phone’s right side means it’s not the easiest of buttons to reach; while an inability to turn it into a quick-launch key for any installed app is a little frustrating too.
Moving parts, like the phone’s flip camera, usually mean no water resistance and that certainly seems to be the case here. The phone does, at least, pack a 3.5mm headphone jack (with FM radio support) and Asus even throws some wired headphones in-box – a real rarity in 2019.
Asus Zenfone 6 performance – it can challenge the best and serve well long-term
Qualcomm’s Jussi Nevanlinna spent a notable about of time waxing lyrical about the virtues of his company’s latest and greatest chipset at the ZenFone’s launch. Indeed, the Snapdragon 855 that’s also found inside everything from the US Samsung Galaxy S10, to the OnePlus 7, to the forthcoming Sony Xperia 1 is also powering the ZenFone 6.
Nevanlinna stated that the 7nm chip is 45 percent faster in CPU and 20 percent faster in GPU performance, compared to the ZenFone 6’s flagship predecessor, the 845-powered ZenFone 5Z.

I was able to trial the more potent £599.99 8GB RAM model (the base model features 6GB RAM), which in Trusted’s standard gamut of benchmark tests performed exceptionally well, challenging our current front-runner – the Black Shark 2 – across performance and gaming tests via Geekbench 4, AnTuTu and 3D Mark.
This translates to a perfectly smooth and consistent user experience, with no evidence of slow-down or lag, even when multitasking. Even without the dedicated AI Boost gaming mode, the phone breezed through intense titles.
All this, paired with the promise of consistent software updates from Asus for at least two more years, the ZenFone 6 should remain a strong performer in the long-term.
The Zenfone 6 battery life isn’t as good as expected
Battery is also a fundamental part of the phone’s makeup. At launch, company representatives were very clear that Asus favours greater outright longevity compared to fast or wireless charging technologies in the fight against battery anxiety.
As such, the ZenFone 6 comes equipped with a huge 5000mAh cell, which paired with the Full HD+ resolution display should ensure the phone is able to dole out some impressive battery life figures. Quick Charge 4+ support is also built in but a more conventional 18W fast-charger comes in-box.
I say ‘should’ as in real-world testing I was left underwhelmed by the ZenFone 6’s longevity. It’s by no means bad, granting me up to two days of use on a single charge, regularly. However, when you take into account screen-on time, the ZenFone 6 falls short of the mark.
Out-the-box the phone would consistently dole out a rather middling 4 to 4.5 hours of screen-on time, depending on usage, while switching from the phone’s native light system colour scheme to ‘dark’ (i.e. dark mode) added an extra hour to ZenFone’s stamina (I left dark mode on after I discovered this).
It’s worth remembering that such figures aren’t by any means bad, and most users will be more than happy with the ZenFone 6’s battery life, however, the figures it produces match up to that of the OnePlus 7 Pro, with its 4000mAh cell, and the Huawei P30 Pro, which in Trusted’s tests, gave up after a whopping 6.5 hours of screen-on time, despite also rocking a far smaller 4200mAh battery.

More specific testing like streaming Netflix for 30 minutes sapped only 2% of the battery, while 4K HDR content at full brightness consumed 6 percent. As for gaming, most titles, including more intensive offerings like Asphalt 9, will consume between 3 and 4 percent in the same time-frame.
As for fast-charging, the included 18W brick delivered consistent recharge speeds of the phone’s 5000mAh cell, hitting 100 percent in 127 minutes (2 hours, 7 minutes), but more useful milestones far sooner. The phone refills to 51 percent charge – more than enough for a day’s use – after 45 minutes, and is two-thirds full after an hours charging.
The phone should refill faster if paired with a more potent (read: higher wattage) Quick Charge 4+ adapter, but these figures are close to what most users should expect.
The ZenFone 6 display takes centre stage
Thanks to Asus’ efforts with the flip camera, the extended 19.5:9 display enjoys wonderfully thin bezels, resulting in a promising 92 percent screen-to-body ratio. The IPS LCD panel integrates a blue light filter plus support for HDR10-compliant content.

The choice of display tech means it certainly doesn’t boast quite the same visual ‘pop’ as its OLED-laden rivals but it’s an undeniably pleasing display in proportion to its glass and metal body. Asus has also added a dark mode, which again, doesn’t prove quite as useful where LCDs are concerned but is appreciated nonetheless.
The screen also benefits from a number of software enhancements, starting with a one-handed mode but also thanks to the ‘Splendid’ colour management toolset – which lets you adjust colour temperature and accuracy with ease.
In testing, it does a solid job of covering the sRGB (99.7 percent), Adobe RGB (80.6 percent) and DCI-P3 (95.5 percent) colour spaces, leading to pleasingly accurate and rich colours, but most impressive of all is its real-world maximum brightness, which at 535 nits, is among the brightest phones we’ve testing, going toe-to-toe with last year’s LCD-toting LG G7.
Asus Zenfone 6 software – the cleanest take on ZenUI to date
Not dissimilar from Huawei’s Emotion UI, Asus’ ZenUI has come under fire in the past for being heavy-handed and downright unappealing to look at. ZenUI 6 atop Android Pie as it appears on the ZenFone 6, seems like a significant step in the right direction.
The main crux of the redesign is in its willingness to more readily embrace Google’s stock take on Android. ZenUI 6 still can’t relinquish some of the company’s bloatware, but on the flip side does include some richer features that surpass what the Pixel Launcher is able to offer.

While UI layout and some elements feel close to stock, you’ll still find a bevvy of additional Asus apps (some, more welcome than others), plus enhancements like one-handed mode, a screen recorder with gaming tools built-in, quick-launch gestures and more.
At launch, Asus also revealed that its optimisations have resulted in reduced app load times across the board. What’s more, beyond joining the Android Beta Program, Asus promises that ZenFone 6 users can expect an update to both Android Q and Android R, as and when they launch.
I did run into a couple of software bugs while testing the ZenFone 6; one that shifted home screen elements so that they were only partially visible for a short time, as well as a more serious blunder that asked for a PIN when booting the phone up that wasn’t my standard lock screen passcode.
Despite such hiccups, everything proved easy enough to remedy and I have confidence if Asus really is as committed to the software experience on its phones as it says it is and appears to be, then such issues will be remedied fairly quickly.
Should I buy the Asus ZenFone 6?
Asus has clearly poured a lot of time and energy into making the ZenFone 6 its most competitive phone to date.
If you’re in the market for a more affordable flagship, the ZenFone slips into the same +/-£500 price range as the Xiaomi Mi 9, OnePlus 7 and the forthcoming Oppo Reno. It also happens to pack the same Snapdragon 855 chipset and sport the same 48-megapixel primary camera as these rivals too.
As such, the main considerations between this assortment fall to their software, camera quality and battery performance (click any of the above device names to read their respective reviews).
If you want a superior camera, consider the even cheaper Pixel 3a (£399) or 3a XL (£469). If you want a better screen, then the OnePlus 7 Pro is the best in the business.
Despite the overlaps that the ZenFone 6 possesses with a number of its competitors, there really isn’t anything with quite as unique a makeup as this handset. The camera has the potential to improve via software updates, Asus seems more committed than most to supporting this phone in the long-term, and the user experience is the best the company has ever produced.
Asus might not have the ‘cool factor’ of OnePlus or the hardware/software integration of Google but the new ZenFone 6 still stands out for the right reasons.

Verdict




























 



The Motorola One Vision is an excellent mid-range smartphone that gets nearly all the basics right. But the Pixel 3a has a much better camera and is only moderately more expensive.

The Motorola One Vision doesn’t have the wow factor of the company’s more established Moto G7 Plus. But having thoroughly put the phone through its paces I can confirm it’s one of the best mid-range phones money can buy at the moment. Here’s why.
Related: Amazon Prime Day 2019
Motorola One Vision’s Android One experience gives you super clean software
At a glance, the Motorola One Vision is a bog-standard looking smartphone. Like pretty much every 2019 flagship, and many mid-rangers, the One Vision sports a mixed material design that’s clearly taken much inspiration from the Galaxy S10 – it even has the same ugly hole-punch design front camera.
But it’s not the design that makes it special: It’s the phone’s software that sets it apart. The Motorola One Vision is part of Google’s Android One programme. This doesn’t sound like much but it’s actually a fairly unique and important selling point that’s rare in the sub-£300 price bracket.
This is a key factor that guarantees the handset will run a pristine, nigh, untouched version of Google’s mobile OS and receive updates to new versions of Android for a few generations to come. You’re not going to get that guarantee with any other £269 smartphone.
The only reason that past One-series phones such as last year’s Motorola One didn’t get Trusted’s hallowed 4.5 or 5-star rating was because of their slightly mediocre hardware.

The Motorola One Vision battery lasts a day
As well as guaranteeing software updates, the clean Android install also offers a few tertiary benefits. The biggest of these is how it helps improve the phone’s battery life and performance.
This is because most Android Skins, like the OnePlus 7’s Oxygen OS and the Samsung Galaxy S10’s One UI add a load of features that run in the background. These can add cool new functionality but they also put a drain on the phone’s battery life.
The lack of these background processes is likely a key reason why the Motorola One Vision offers such good battery life, despite featuring an average-sized 3500mAh cell. With regular-to-heavy use, the phone will easily last a full day with around 20 to 30 percent of its juice still to spare.
Regular use entailed regularly checking social media and incoming messages, listening to music throughout the day, playing a few games of PUBG Mobile at lunch and watching some YouTube videos before bed.
It also deals with intensive gaming and video streaming fairly well. Watching Netflix with the screen at 150 nits brightness – the level most people will find comfortable – the One Vision lost around 7 to 9 percent of its charge per hour, which is respectable. The G7 Plus lost around 10 to 13 percent running the same test.

Motorola One Vision benchmarks – A solid, affordable all-rounder
The clean install and lack of bloatware also helps performance. With real-world use, the phone blitzes through most tasks, including 3D gaming, despite being powered by mid-range hardware. My real-world impressions rang true when I ran the Motorola One Vision through Trusted’s standard suite of synthetic benchmarks.
You can see how it performed compared to the Moto G7 Plus below.

This adds up to make the Motorola One Vision a stellar mid-range smartphone that delivers on nearly all the basics. Make no mistake, if you want a great Android phone for less than £300 you’ll struggle to do better.
The camera on the Motorola One Vision has OnePlus 7-rivaling tech, but it’s not perfect
If you’re buying the One Vision as a result of Motorola’s aggressive marketing around the phone’s camera there are a few niggles you should be aware of.
Camera tech is currently the primary battleground in the smartphone market. Which is why Motorola has spent a lot of time marketing the One Vision’s photography chops and from a hardware perspective it’s pretty impressive, considering its price.
Motorola has loaded the One Vision with a dual rear camera setup that combines a primary 48-megapixel f/1.7 sensor, with OIS (optical image stabilisation), plus a secondary 5-megapixel f/2.2 depth sensor. The setup is very similar to that found on the OnePlus 7, which uses the same primary Sony IMX586 main sensor, again with a 5-megapixel secondary sensor for depth.
While the hardware is impressive at this point, the camera still feels distinctly average. In regular light, it works fine, for the most part. Shots taken around London during the day don’t match those taken on the Pixel 3a when it comes to overall quality but they don’t look overprocessed either and have suitably realistic colours all the same – my only real quibble is that skylines occasionally looked over-exposed.
The biggest annoyance is the camera’s autofocus, which is noticeably slower than the Moto G7 Plus’. There’s a clear delay when shifting subject matter, even in decent lighting, which makes impromptu photography a little tricky.
The issue is exacerbated in low light, where the One Vision’s rear camera once again proves to be good but not great. Photos taken in low light aren’t the worst I’ve seen on a phone and a step above what you’d get on most phones at this price. However, even with a dedicated night mode, photos taken in low light are still prone to picking up noise and have a pixelated look when viewed on a big screen.
This is a shame, as the Sony sensor and One Vision’s software have a few unique features designed specifically for low light photography. The sensor uses “quad-pixel” tech, which makes the camera intelligently shoot and combine four pixel’s worth of image data into a single 12-megapixel snap every time you hit the shutter button. In theory, this should help remove noise and improve low-light performance.
For avid selfie-takers, the tech also features on the Motorola One Vision’s 25-megapixel front sensor, which captures with giant 1.8µm pixels – a factor that, on paper, should let you take usable selfies in low light.
As a final trick, Motorola has added its own camera app to further improve image quality. It follows the AI trend Google started with its Pixel line of phones and is one of the only additions, aside from Moto Actions, to the One Vision’s software. It includes a nifty AI feature that’s designed to help improve lighting in portrait shots and bokeh effects powered by machine learning.
The tech works quite well and gives portrait shots a decent sense of depth that’s missing on photos taken on competing phones around this price. But again, it’s not industry-leading and pixelation rapidly creeps in when shooting in low light.

The Motorola One Vision’s screen also has a few small niggles
I’m also not convinced by the Motorola One Vision’s second “unique” feature: its 6.3-inch Full HD+ 21:9 panel. The Motorola One Vision isn’t the first phone to feature a 21:9 aspect ratio – we saw this on the Sony Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus earlier this year but it’s still a rarity.
The theorised reason for the unusual aspect ratio is to offer up more screen real-estate when scrolling through apps such as Twitter but also to make movie watching more immersive (many modern movies are mastered in 21:9).
I’m not convinced about the need for it when watching movies, though. This is because most modern movies don’t take advantage of the aspect ratio when streamed on Netflix, Google Play or Crunchyroll. The aspect ratio is a bigger issue when gaming. Android games aren’t mastered for this aspect ratio, so popular titles, like PUBG, clip the screen, leaving big black bars on either side of the play area.
This is a little sad as the screen is otherwise one of the best I’ve tested on a phone this price. The 456.5 nit max brightness is excellent for a phone as affordable as this and coupled with the 0.1 nit black level gives the screen an impressive 1230:1 contrast ratio. To non-techies, this means the screen is wonderfully immersive and great for Netflix binges.

Should I buy the Motorola One Vision?
If you’re after a mid-range Android phone with near untouched Google software, you could do a lot worse than the Motorola One Vision. The phone gets all the basics right and thanks to that Android One user experience it’s blissfully bloatware free. It’s also guaranteed to get updates to newer versions of Android, which is rare on phones around this price.
The only serious downside is that its camera doesn’t match Motorola’s performance claims and I’m still not convinced a 21:9 aspect ratio screen is actually that beneficial. Google’s spiffy new Pixel 3a throws a further spanner in the works. The Pixel 3a costs a bit more but it offers a similarly clear Android install and a much better camera.
