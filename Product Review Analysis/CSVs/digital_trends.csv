0,IPhone 13,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-13-review/,"The iPhone 13 is the new iPhone that Apple expects most people to buy, and it’s easy to see why. It has most of what makes the premium 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max great, including the blazing-fast A15 Bionic processor, an ultrawide camera, and a battery that easily provides than a full day of usage before you need to recharge.If you’re a true power user, the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max will beat out the iPhone 13 with their 120Hz ProMotion screens, additional telephoto lens, and generally superior lowlight performance. But you’ll also pay a premium over the base iPhone 13, and let’s face it: The average person isn’t going to split hairs over 60Hz and adaptive 120Hz. The iPhone 13, together with its pint-sized sibling, the iPhone 13 Mini, gets the job done and gets it done well.The iPhone 13 doesn’t depart dramatically from the design of the iPhone 12. The model I tested was a darker blue than the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max’s sierra blue, which is more of a sky blue color. I like both options, and I’m not surprised they’re proving to be popular choices. You still get the square edges along the sides bounded by aluminum, rather the than stainless steel of the Pro, a Lightning port, bottom-firing speakers, volume buttons on the left below the Ring/Silent switch, and a Side button on the right that activates Siri and can turn the screen on and off.As with other iPhone models, the iPhone 13 is IP68 dust- and water-resistant and stood up to a thorough rinsing in the sink after I accidentally dropped it into dirt in the park while juggling four phones in my hands. Both the front and back are protected by Ceramic Shield, which is made by Corning, just like the latest Gorilla Glass Victus you’ll find on more recent Android flagships.The front looks largely the same compared to the iPhone 12, though Apple says the notch that accommodates the TrueDepth camera is 20% smaller. That’s technically true because it’s narrower, but it’s also a bit deeper now, so in my eyes, the trade-off is a bit of a wash. Face ID works the same as before, but its usability with a face mask, and especially a face mask and sunglasses, was hit-and-miss at best. You can do an alternate scan to improve performance with face masks, but it also compromises security, so I preferred to leave it off.The more notable difference comes when you look at the back. There’s still a vaguely squarish camera housing, but the camera array is positioned differently, with the two sensors placed across from each other rather than vertically. That’s the primary way you’ll be able to tell the older and newer models apart.Other differences are a bit harder to spot. The iPhone 13 measures 5.78 x 2.81 x 0.30 inches and weighs 6.14 ounces, making it just a tiny bit heavier than the 5.78-ounce iPhone 12, likely to accommodate the larger battery. That’s a worthy trade-off, and in terms of overall footprint and pocketability, I consider the iPhone 13 to be a one-handed device even though the iPhone 13 Mini is Apple’s “official” compact phone.						The 6.1-inch Super Retina OLED screen is big enough that text, apps, and the keyboard never feel cramped, which was an issue for me using the Mini. The 2532 x 1170 Super Retina OLED screen is plenty crisp, certified to work with HDR10 and Dolby Vision for higher dynamic range, and works out to 460 pixels per inch. The bottom-firing speakers were also surprisingly loud and didn’t suffer from much distortion except on the highest volumes, making them more than capable of serving as your audio output when you’re too lazy to pair with headphones.The screen is 60Hz, but if you’ve never used a higher refresh rate, you won’t be bothered by it. It’s still a little disappointing not to see ProMotion filter across the entire lineup, especially when you’re paying for an $800 phone. You won’t find an Android phone in this price range that doesn’t have a higher refresh rate, and even more affordable midrange options support it.Viewing angles are great, colors are rich and accurate, and outdoor visibility is excellent thanks to 800 nits of peak brightness. When viewing HDR photos and video, the phone can punch brightness up even higher to 1,200 nits. I didn’t have trouble viewing text, navigating on Google Maps, or seeing the camera viewfinder, even in direct sunlight.Power is one thing you’ll never find lacking on an iPhone, and the iPhone 13 is no exception. It’s powered by an A15 Bionic processor, has 4GB RAM, and comes with a variety of higher storage options, including 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, though you notably don’t get the highest tier 1TB storage option – that’s exclusive to the Pro models.The review unit I tested came with an ample 512GB of storage, which was more than enough for my needs — even when taking a lot of photos and 4K video. I suspect 256GB will offer the best balance between price and capacity for most people.I suspect 256GB will offer the best balance between price and capacity for most people.My average day-to-day usage with the iPhone involved quite a bit of time on Twitter, Reddit, and Microsoft Teams, some browsing, lots of photos, and playing some Genshin Impact. Unsurprisingly, the iPhone 13 handled everything I threw at it without any lag or slowdowns. Benchmark testing backs up the strong performance with 827,398 on AnTuTu, which measures overall performance, and 55.1 frames per second on 3DMark’s demanding Wild Life graphics benchmark.Apple’s marketing material made bold claims that the iPhone 13 can get 2.5 hours more battery life than the iPhone 12. It’s the sort of claim I always take with a grain of salt, especially as a power user who does a lot more on my phone than the average person. So, I was pleasantly surprised when these claims not only proved to be accurate, but were blown out of the water, with the iPhone 13 comfortably lasting a day and a half before needing to recharge.Part of the reason for this is that the 3,240mAh cell is bigger than the 2,815mAh battery the iPhone 12 came with. That’s a sizable jump, and it does pay off in longer runtime. But what’s also going on is that Apple has improved battery optimization and management with the A15 Bionic, letting you eke more juice out of the cell.I could leave it unplugged and still have plenty of juice the next day.While the previous iPhone might have required topping up while I slept, the iPhone 13 standby time was good enough that I could leave it unplugged and still have plenty of juice the next day. It’s great to see and is arguably the killer feature for the iPhone 13, especially for those who are on older models.That does bring me to the downside, though. While the iPhone 13 is fully MagSafe compatible and supports 20-watt wired charging, 15-watt MagSafe charging, and 7.5-watt Qi wireless charging, it still uses a Lightning port. As I noted in my preliminary hands-on, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to incorporate non-USB-C devices in my life.Most of my battery packs, chargers, and even my PC support USB-C now, as does my MacBook Air and the new iPad Mini. The iPhone 13 lineup, together with the new iPad 10.2, are the only devices still holding on to the old charging port. This made the iPhone 13 more of an inconvenience than it needed to be while traveling, though in the broader scheme of things, it’s a relatively minor issue that can be fixed with an extra adapter. Still, it does make me hope that we won’t need to deal with it for next year’s model.Connectivity is pretty standard. The iPhone 13 supports 5G, Ultra Wideband, sub-6GHz, mmWave, and basically all the bands you’d expect from a flagship phone. I tested on T-Mobile in the greater NYC area, and connectivity was good enough, but I never really hit the promised 5G speeds. This is more of a network congestion and rollout problem than an iPhone 13 problem. In a lot of places, even New York, 5G exists more on paper than in practice. Aside from that, you’ll also get dual-band Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 Cameras are where a lot of the magic for iPhones happens. You get a dual rear camera array with a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 12MP ultrawide at 120 degrees. Unlike the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, there isn’t a third telephoto camera, so you can’t take shots with optical zoom, and you won’t benefit from macro photography.Regardless, photo quality is – put simply – excellent. On launch, the Camera app will ask you the filter you want to apply to your photos. Your choices are standard, the iPhone 13’s default setting; vivid, which punches up colors and saturation; and separate options for cooler and warmer filters. I shot exclusively in standard mode for testing purposes and personal preference, which I believe is the setting most people will use since it’s most true to life.As you can see in the many sample shots, the iPhone 13 does great in outdoor settings. Colors are punchy even on standard mode, and the automatic exposure ably handles the contrast between shadows and areas of direct, blinding sunlight well without washing out like many lesser phones do. The bright blue sky, the puffy white cloud, the green grass of the park, the ripples and reflections of the pond, everything looks great to my eyes.Detail is plentiful; it’s possible to make out individual branches and leaves when you zoom in, though very close inspection will show edge distortion. Ultrawide and standard shots both look great, with some mild fish-eye effect for the ultrawide. Overall, if you were happy with the iPhone 12 camera performance, you’ll be perfectly happy with the iPhone 13 sensors.This is kitchen sink stuff, though. Almost every flagship phone these days, and even many midrange ones, can take great photos in good lighting. The real standouts are the ones that do well in low light, and that’s what makes the iPhone 13 special. The Camera app will automatically kick into Night mode and adjust exposure to take in more light for a clearer, brighter image in darker settings. In a completely dark setting, this can last for as long as 30 seconds, though it’ll extend the exposure to five to seven seconds in most dimmer settings.The outcome is a shot with more crispness, color accuracy, and clarity than you typically get in lowlight settings. However, it’s worth noting that there’s also some muddiness in detail, especially compared to the iPhone 13 Pro.You can record 4K at 60 frames per second, 30 fps, and 24 fps for video. It also supports 1080p at 60/30 fps, but I didn’t feel the need to record in a lower resolution given that I had 512GB of storage. I was blown away by how stable video recording was, especially when tracking moving objects.Stabilization tends to be a significant problem with any kind of handheld video recording, but the iPhone 13 managed it so handily that I felt like I was recording with a gimbal. Panning around also didn’t produce any dropped frames or auto-exposure issues.Like the other iPhone models, the iPhone 13 supports Cinematic mode, which adds a blur effect to the background of people and objects, sort of like a movie camera. It works best with faces, and you can tell the blur is clearly an artificial effect, but it’s a neat feature when it works. It doesn’t work so well with objects, especially moving objects, but on the plus side, it works with the dual 12MP selfie cameras, which is a pleasant surprise.Among other features, you have Portrait mode on the rear and front sensor, adding blur and depth to images. It resulted in pleasing photos, and I had a lot of fun playing around with the different background options.The iPhone 13 can update to iOS 15 the moment you power it up, which I did immediately. The latest operating system is packed with features like an improved notification summary, text scanning in the camera app, tabs for Safari, and support for storing immunization records, COVID vaccines, and even your driver’s license.It’s not really worth comparing iOS 15 to Android, in my opinion. At this point, you know the differences between them, and you know which one you prefer. I will say that this release of iOS 15 seems to have more compatibility issues than previous releases. For instance, the Apple Watch unlock simply didn’t work for me with the Apple Watch Series 6. Undoubtedly, many of these issues can and will be fixed, so none of them is a deal breaker.The iPhone 13 is currently available on sale for a starting price of $799 in pink, blue, midnight, starlight, and Product Red color options. It also has 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage size options, and works with all major U.S. carriers.The iPhone 13 strikes an outstanding balance between size, performance, and price. It’s smaller than the gargantuan iPhone 13 Pro Max, but offers more screen real estate than the cramped iPhone 13 Mini. The battery life is the real standout feature, giving you a full day of runtime and charge without issue. Then there’s the great camera performance despite the lack of a telephoto lens. If you’re not willing or able to shell out for the premium features of the iPhone 13 Pro, the iPhone 13 won’t let you down, and I recommend it over the Mini as a good compact phone alternative.As is often the case, Apple’s strongest competitor is usually itself. The iPhone 13 is most directly challenged by the iPhone 13 Pro, which is just like it in terms of size but better across the board in almost every regard. The 13 Pro and Pro Max will both give you a 120Hz ProMotion display, a telephoto lens for 3x optical zoom, an even longer-lasting battery, and superior lowlight camera performance.By contrast, the iPhone 13 Mini is identical in hardware and capabilities, but it’s much smaller and meant for those who genuinely love compact phones and don’t mind the cramped screen. Battery life won’t last quite as long, though. If you have an iPhone 12, the difference between the two devices isn’t huge, and the iPhone 13 isn’t likely worth the upgrade.Outside of the Apple universe, plenty of capable Android phones can offer you a great camera and battery life, including the Samsung Galaxy S21, OnePlus 9 Pro, and the upcoming Google Pixel 6. But if you already exist in the Apple ecosystem, you’re likely not considering these as options, though they’re equally worthy choices if you’re willing to make the switch.The standard warranty is one year, but you can get Apple Care+ to extend it for 24 to 36 months and it covers two incidents of accidental damage for each interval of 12 months. In terms of durability, the phone is IP68, so it can stand up to complete immersion. I played rough with it, and it still survived drops with no noticeable scrapes on the Ceramic Glass. Combined with the regular software and security updates, you should be able to easily make the iPhone 13 last for at least three years, if not longer.Yes. If you like the price, size, and extra battery life, the iPhone 13 offers plenty of value, even if it isn’t the most premium option in the lineup."
1,IPhone 13 Pro,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-13-pro-review/,"I’ll say it upfront; the iPhone 13 Pro is the new iPhone model you should buy if you can afford it. Unlike last year’s iPhone 12 Pro, it has all the same capabilities as the larger Pro Max model. You’ll remember that last year, the 12 Pro Max had bigger camera sensors, giving it better lowlight performance and 3x optical zoom, rather than 2x.Not so this year. The iPhone 13 Pro has all the guts of the 13 Pro Max (aside from battery capacity and screen size, of course) without busting your hand or your wallet. Add into the mix the powerful A15 Bionic processor, 120Hz ProMotion display, battery life that can last almost two days, and excellent camera performance, and you get the best iPhone 13 model in the entire lineup.The iPhone 13 Pro I reviewed came in gold, which isn’t my color of choice, but you work with what you have. Both the front and the back are protected by Ceramic Glass and there’s a squared-off stainless steel strip running along the sides, setting it apart in quality from the cheaper aluminum of the iPhone 13.All the standard buttons are present including the Ring/Silent switch and volume buttons on the left and the Side button on the right to activate Siri and toggle the screen on and off. There are also bottom-firing speakers on either side of the Lightning port. As I’ve pointed out with other iPhone 13 models I’ve reviewed, it’s a letdown to see Apple continue to stick to Lightning, especially when most people largely have USB-C devices. But I hold out hope that Apple will make the change for next year’s model.The iPhone 13 Pro measures 5.78 x 2.81 x 0.3 inches and weighs 7.2 ounces. Those are more or less the same dimensions as the iPhone 12 Pro (5.78 x 2.82 x 0.29 inches), but it tips the scale at almost an ounce heavier (6.66 ounces) due to the additional battery capacity and telephoto lens, both of which are welcome additions that are worth the extra weight. In terms of usability, I found it to be as usable as the iPhone 13 — you can navigate it with one hand and reach across the screen. It’s only with the Pro Max that you start pushing the limits of one-handed use.Like all the other iPhone models, the iPhone 13 supports IP68 dust- and water-resistance. I confess that came into play more often than I expected because the phone took a few spills in the park while I was juggling devices around during testing. That’s also how it picked up a gouge on the screen despite the Ceramic Glass protecting the front. It’s usually not visible unless the light reflects on it just so and it doesn’t impact usability. And if you’re more careful than me and not doing a circus act in the park (or you are using a case or screen protector), you likely won’t suffer from this issue.In terms of physical differences between the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro, there aren’t too many. The TrueDepth sensor has a 20% smaller notch on the screen according to Apple, which is true, but it’s also a bit deeper, and as far as I could tell, it doesn’t add a meaningful amount of usable screen real estate. As always, there’s Face ID, which I generally found to be hit-or-miss when wearing a face mask. You can do some alternate face scans to make it work better, but it also isn’t as secure, so I decided not to go for it.On the back, the sensor array is pretty similar to last year. There’s a vaguely square camera housing and three cameras. The only notable difference is that each camera sensor is bigger, and the camera bump protrudes a bit more. That’s a fair trade-off for the improved camera performance in my estimation.There are a lot of selling points for the iPhone 13 Pro, but one of the biggest is the screen, and we don’t mean in just size. Like the iPhone 13, it’s a 6.1-inch Super Retina OLED screen with great color accuracy, 2532 x 1170 resolution, and 460 pixels per inch. It’s sharp, bright viewing angles are great, it can hit 1,000 nits in brightness, and punch up to 1,200 nits for HDR content. Outdoor visibility is excellent even in direct sunlight, and the screen also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.That’s all fantastic, but what really sets it apart is the 120Hz ProMotion display. ProMotion is a technology that first hit the iPad Pro series in 2017, letting Apple increase the refresh rate from the standard 60Hz to 120Hz for different kinds of content. This has become standard on Android flagship phones, but it’s a tech that Apple has been slow to adopt outside the iPad Pros, so it’s great to see it on both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.What’s particularly unique about Apple implementation of ProMotion is that the iPhone 13 Pro uses a low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panel, meaning that it’s able to dynamically vary the refresh rate from as low as 10Hz when doing something basic like browsing to up to 120Hz for something demanding like rapidly scrolling or gaming. This kind of implementation was first developed for the always-on screen of the Apple Watch to save battery life, and it has the same effect on the iPhone 13 Pro, but I’ll touch more on that in the battery section.In actual usage, the ProMotion OLED screen is smooth and fantastic to use. As someone who was using the 120Hz-capable Samsung Galaxy Fold 3 before picking up the iPhone 13 Pro, the transition was seamless in terms of usability and smoothness, despite the change in display size. And don’t let anyone tell you that you won’t notice the difference.After getting used to 120Hz, it’s impossible to go back, which does bring me to the one downside of the implementation – not all apps run in 120Hz. Most of the games I tested max out at 60 frames per second (fps), and at the time of testing, many third-party app animations weren’t enabled for 120Hz, meaning animations looked stuttery while scrolling was smooth. All this will undoubtedly change over time as more app developers enable support for ProMotion, but it’s something to be mindful of.I don’t usually comment on speaker quality since there’s only so much you can do on a phone speaker, but the iPhone 13 Pro has remarkably robust stereo speakers. They don’t suffer from much distortion, even at higher volumes, and offer good range.To some extent, it feels a little pointless to talk about performance on the latest iPhone model. It’s the iPhone 13 Pro; it has the latest and greatest A15 Bionic processor with 6GB RAM, so of course, it’s going to be an improvement over what came before it. You get various large storage options, including 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB, which is what the model I tested had. That’s a significant amount of storage, letting you download tons of apps and games and take plenty of photos and video. I didn’t even come close to filling it up during my testing.I know I said benchmarks were pointless to run on the latest iPhone, but I ran them anyway, and the results 9below) confirmed the phone’s powerful capabilities. I was able to launch plenty of apps and play demanding games like Genshin Impact and Asphalt 9. The iPhone 13 Pro will handle everything you can throw at it, and then some.AnTuTu: 823,553Storage Read/Write: 1635.3/1768.6 MB/sRAM Read/Write: 205.8/83.2 MB/s3Dmark Wild Life Extreme:  56.4 fpsThe iPhone 13 Pro is a battery king. Not quite so much as the Pro Max, but it still lasted for well over a day. If I really wanted to, I could go almost two days before needing to recharge. A lot of this is due to optimized power usage from combining the larger A15 Bionic processor and the LTPO screen with its variable refresh rate. The cell is also larger at 3,095mAh compared to the 2,815mAh battery that came with the iPhone 12 Pro. The result is hours more runtime with average usage, even as a power user.The iPhone 13 Pro is a battery king.As with all the other iPhone 13 models, the Pro is MagSafe compatible, supports 20-watt fast wired charging, 15W MagSafe charging, and 7.5W Qi wireless charging.Connectivity is as good as you’d expect, with support for 5G, Ultra Wideband, sub-6GHz, and mmWave. I tested on T-Mobile in the greater NYC area, and while it didn’t live up to expected 5G speeds, connectivity was pretty stable overall. The phone also supports dual-band Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0.The iPhone 13 Pro, together with its larger sibling, has the best camera array in the lineup. You get three 12-megapixel sensors: A 12MP wide-angle, a 12MP telephoto, and a 12MP ultrawide that can take 120-degree snaps. This camera array translates into truly incredible photo outcomes. At launch, the Camera app has you set your preferred filter. For this review (and personal preference), all photos were taken in Standard mode, which is most true to life.All the shots taken outdoors in bright sunlight were excellent. Both the standard and ultrawide cameras picked up plenty of detail and accurate color. The rich blueness of the sky, the fluffy white clouds, the green grass, the reflections and ripples of the pond, and even the fine details of individual tree branches all came across great.Also notable is how well the phone handled shots in direct sunlight. Blazing sun tends to be a big challenge for phones, even flagships. The iPhone 13 Pro handled it like a — dare I say it – pro. Even when the sun was a blazing orb in the sky, it didn’t completely wash out the photo or cast everything into shadow. There was some darkness to the image and some colors, especially muddiness to tree canopies, but Apple’s software processing is clearly at play here, and it’s impressive to see.Also worthy of praise is the detail in both the ultrawide and telephoto lenses.Also worthy of praise is the detail in both the ultrawide and telephoto lenses. While I did sometimes notice a bit of edge distortion when shooting in telephoto, by and large, it came across with outstanding clarity and detail. It’s also a champ at focusing on what’s most relevant in the photo, a fact we noted in our deep-dive comparisons with the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, where the iPhone 13 Pro generally came out on top more often than not when it came to focusing. At the same time, the Ultra won out in sheer 10x optical zoom.Aside from the 3x telephoto zoom, the other big feature at play on the iPhone 13 Pro is macro photography. Normally, when you focus in close on an object, the phone loses focus and blurs out. It just can’t handle the focal length. The iPhone 13 Pro, on the other hand, can swap to the zoom lens to give you a very close focus on objects. This kicks in automatically, and while the outcome doesn’t always work out, when it does, the results look great, with lots of detail, like the stitching in a crocheting piece or the individual veins in a leaf.The one downside is that since this is entirely automatic, you can’t manually force the phone into macro mode, so if you try to shoot macro on a moving object like a flower blown by the wind, it’s easy to get kicked in and out of macro mode.Last but by no means least when it comes to photography are lowlight photos. The iPhone 13 Pro has a Night mode that takes effect automatically when it detects lighting conditions aren’t ideal. It largely works by increasing autoexposure so that a photo that might have snapped immediately will instead take five to seven seconds to let in more light for an image with better clarity. The outcome is photos taken at night and in dark rooms are a lot clearer than you usually get, with better color accuracy. There’s some loss of detail and muddiness, but it’s still an impressive result in most shots I took.Cinematic mode is supported on both the rear and front cameras. It’s a neat effect that adds a movie-like blur to the background. It works best when focusing on faces, but it tends to be hit-and-miss with objects. You also get Portrait mode, which adds the bokeh effect to both front and rear shots. It’s neat, and I ended up snapping several shots outdoors and playing around with the background.Solid #iPhone13Pro pic.twitter.com/mkTRl8xXDB&mdash; AJ (┛ಠ_ಠ)┛彡┻━┻ (@Ajay_H_Kumar) September 26, 2021Adding on to an already impressive set of capabilities is the iPhone 13 Pro’s video recording capabilities. It can handle 4K at 24/30/60 fps and 1080p at 30/60 fps. I recorded smooth and steady 4K video of a plane flying overhead with almost no shake or loss of focus that I could notice. It’s rare to get that level of stabilization on a phone without the assistance of a gimbal.The iPhone 13 Pro updates to iOS 15 out of the box. We took a deeper dive into individual features that rolled out with the operating system, but the notable ones are improved notification summaries, support for text scanning in the camera app, tabs for Safari, and future support for storing immunization records and other data.This review isn’t an evaluation of iOS versus Android. We have plenty of those sorts of pieces if that’s what you’re interested in, and by now, you already likely know which ecosystem you prefer. However, I will note that this release of iOS had more bugs at launch than I’ve typically seen. Aside from the app optimization for the 120Hz screen and the hit-or-miss Face ID, I also had an issue with the phone not unlocking with my Apple Watch Series 6. Apple has acknowledged this issue, though, and it should be fixed in the next update.The iPhone 13 Pro is currently available on sale for a starting price of $999 in blue, silver, gold, and graphite color options. It also has 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage size options and works with all major U.S. carriers. The only thing to be mindful of when you pick storage size, aside from your needs, is that ProRes recording at 4K 30 fps is only supported with a minimum of 256GB storage.The iPhone 13 Pro is the best iPhone you can get. Giving you the form factor of the iPhone 13, a 120Hz screen, excellent camera performance, tons of battery life, and ludicrous storage options, it truly is a phone for power users. It was a joy to use as my daily driver, and you won’t be disappointed if you shell out for it.In terms of hardware, the iPhone 13 Pro is the best model in the lineup, but if you want a longer-lasting battery and a bigger screen, the iPhone 13 Pro Max has everything in the Pro, just bigger. The iPhone 13 is more affordable, but it’s pared-down with no 120Hz screen, telephoto lens, or support for macro photos> It also doesn’t have a 1TB storage option. The iPhone 13 Mini is an even smaller version with the same hardware, making it a good choice if you love small phones. If you have an iPhone 12 Pro, our camera test didn’t show much difference between the two devices and it likely isn’t worth upgrading.If you’re willing to switch to Android, the Samsung Galaxy S21, OnePlus 9 Pro, and upcoming Google Pixel 6 can all offer equal or better camera performance, just as much power, and plenty of unique features. Android manufacturers also tend to be more innovative with adopting new tech like folding screens, giving you options like the Z Flip 3 and Fold 3.Standard warranty for the iPhone 13 Pro is one year, but you can get Apple Care+ to extend it for 2 to 3 years and cover two instances of accidental damage every 12 months. The phone is also IP68 water- and dust-resistant, letting it survive full immersion and rinsing in the sink. I did personally suffer a superficial gouge when I dropped the phone on rocky ground without a case, but that’s hardly standard use and easy to avoid. Apple is also great about software and security updates, so your iPhone 13 Pro should feel like new for three years or more.Yes. There’s no question that the iPhone 13 Pro is the best model in the entire lineup, with all the same capabilities as the Pro Max without the bulk or the bigger hit to your wallet."
2,Moto G (2021),Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/moto-g-power-2021-review/,"The Moto G series has long offered excellent value for money, adorned recommendation guides for best budget phones, and brought a reliable experience to those who don’t want or need a flagship phone. But in recent years, competition has heated up, with phones like the iPhone SE, the Google Pixel 4a, and more, offering flagship-level features for only $100 or so more.For 2021, Motorola has updated the Moto G series, with the headline phone, the Moto G Power, getting an impressive price tag of only $200, or $250 for the top model. That’s $100 less than the Pixel 4a, $150 less than the iPhone SE, and significantly undercuts other phones of a similar quality.Is the Moto G Power the way to go for phones under $250, or should you keep saving? We put the 2021 Moto G Power to the test to find out.The 2021 Moto G Power looks and feels like a natural progression from last year’s model. It has a similar design on the front, with its hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera on the top-left of the phone, and a slightly larger 6.6-inch edge-to-edge display with a small chin on the bottom. It looks nice for a sub-$300 phone, especially when you consider the fact that just a few short years ago, edge-to-edge displays commanded a hefty premium.On the back of the phone, you’ll get the camera module, which has been moved to the center in a square camera bump. I don’t really mind the fact that the module is centered, and while putting it on the top left might have made it look more in line with more expensive phones, it still looks good where it is. The back is of course plastic. The slimy gloss looks cool, but feels cheaper than it looks — obviously not as premium-feeling as a glass device.Around the edges of the phone, you’ll get a USB-C port on the bottom, and, thankfully, a headphone jack at the top. On the right side, there’s a volume rocker and a power button with a fingerprint sensor built into it. The sensor worked really well in my testing. It was fast and accurate, which is very nice to see. You will have to get used to using the power button to get into your phone if you aren’t already, but it’s a small adjustment.As mentioned, the display sits in at 6.6 inches, and it has a 720p resolution, which is noticeably lower than last year’s 1,080p display. You could debate that it’s hard to tell the difference between a 1,080p and a 1,440p display, but the difference between a 720p and a 1,080p display is definitely noticeable, and it’s frustrating to see Motorola step back like this. The display does the job, but at a bare minimum.I do wish Motorola included better water-resistance here. The so-called “water-repellant coating” holds little more weight than a marketing message, and chances are, those buying a $250 phone don’t want to have to replace it if it accidentally gets wet. This is a feature that all phones should offer.Under the hood, the Moto G Power offers a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor, coupled with either 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage in the base model or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for $50 extra. There’s also a MicroSD card slot in either case for expanded storage. Weirdly enough, the base model of the phone actually includes lower-power components compared to last year’s Moto G Power, which came with a Snapdragon 665 processor and 4GB of RAM — though I suppose that makes sense given the new lower starting price.Now, the impact is pretty minimal, and actually, the phone performed pretty much the same in benchmarks (the 720p display likely helps there). The Snapdragon 662 and 665 are built on the same architecture and use the same GPU, after all–— the notable shortcomings are a few missing audio components and a lower-end modem. But it’s still a little strange to see Motorola take a step back like this; at a minimum, you’d expect the same chipset year over year.Weirdly enough, there are cutbacks compared to last year’s Moto G Power.In day to day use, the Moto G Power performed decently well, with a few skips and jumps every now and then, as is to be expected for $200. Generally speaking, the device was responsive and fast to react, even during basic mobile gaming and multitasking. Playing a game like Call of Duty: Mobile worked well, and while there was the off dropped frame and stutter on games like Asphalt 9, it still worked well enough for most.Unfortunately, Motorola still hasn’t brought NFC to the Moto G line, so you still can’t use features like Google Pay. This was a minor complaint a few years ago … at this point, that’s a major omission.The Moto G Power comes with a massive 5,000mAh battery, and it shows. That’s the same as last year, but this is one situation where we don’t mind that it’s not an upgrade — and you may end up getting an even better battery life thanks to the lower-resolution display.Most modern flagship phones offer much smaller batteries. The iPhone 12 Pro has around a 2,815mAh battery, while the Pixel 4a has a 3,140mAh battery. And, considering those phones are more demanding, and have higher resolution displays, they last significantly less.Battery life is one of the biggest reasons to buy a Moto G Power.I didn’t have all that long to test the phone but based on my initial testing, I’m certain you can get two days of use out of the device, and even into a third day for lighter users. Really, the battery life on this phone is that good and one of the core reasons to buy it.The Moto G Power supports fast-charging of up to 15W, but unfortunately, there’s no wireless charging here.Like the 2020 Moto G Power, the 2021 model has a triple-lens camera. Motorola has, however, swapped out the ultrawide camera for a depth sensor, and the result is a less versatile experience.You’ll get a 48-megapixel main camera with an f/1.7 aperture, however, it has an effective output of 12 megapixels given the quad pixel tech that Motorola (and most other companies) is using. Along with that, there’s a 2MP macro camera and a 2MP depth camera.Photos from this phone are pretty boring. Colors are muted, and despite the quad-pixel technology, there’s a little more noise in photos than I would have liked. Using the macro lens is fun, for five seconds, before you get over the gimmick of it and realize that you’ll probably never really use it in day-to-day life. That’s a reality of every cheap macro camera, sadly.Now, it’s not all bad. The phone is capable, but not much more. I get it — this is a $200-250 phone. But when you have phones like the Pixel 4a at only $100 more, with a stellar camera, it’s hard to not complain.One of the best things about Motorola phones is the software experience, and that remains true here. The Moto G Power has a stripped-back software experience that should appeal to anyone that wants to cut out the fluff. It’s almost stock Android, and as such it’s responsive and easy to navigate.One of the best things about Motorola phones is their software experience.There are a few tweaks to the system though. The Moto G Power runs what Motorola calls “My UX” software, which includes gestures like the ability to take a screenshot by touching the display with three fingers, silence the phone by picking it up when it’s ringing, or twisting the phone to launch the camera. Through the Moto app, you can also easily change wallpapers and the home screen layout, and turn on the Gametime mode, which lets you tweak how notifications and power work while mobile gaming.It’s all relatively helpful, and it’s really nice that Motorola has added all of these tweaks and settings in the Moto app, rather than breaking them out into the user interface, and cluttering everything up — something that other manufacturers have done.The new Motorola Moto G Power is available starting at $200, which is impressively inexpensive. That gets you the base model with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or you can bump up to $250 for 4GB and 64GB — which I’d recommend. The base model comes in silver (shown in this review), and the higher model comes in dark grey.After a brief pre-order period, the phones are available for purchase as of January 14, straight from the Motorola website, Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and more. Motorola’s distribution is exceptional.The device comes with a standard 12-month limited warranty, which pretty much only covers manufacturer defects. You’ll want to be careful with your device, particularly considering its water resistance.The Moto G Power isn’t going to break any records or blow people away with features. But it offers a solid experience with a huge display and stellar battery life at a low price. It will find a place on our list of the best cheap phones available today. Sure, if you can afford to pay more you should, but if $250 is your budget, this phone is the one to get.Yes, if you can pay more. If you can stretch your budget to $350, then the Google Pixel 4a is easily the phone to go for, thanks to its better processor, day-one software updates, and a great camera. It doesn’t have the size or battery life of the Moto G Power, but those are easy trade-offs.If you can stretch to $400, it’s also worth considering the iPhone SE, but I know that’s a bit of a stretch when your initial budget was $250. So, in Android-land, the Pixel 4a is the phone to beat.Alternatively, there is something to be said for just buying last year’s Moto G Power. It’s still available, and now discounted to $220. As noted it has effectively the same performance, plus a higher-resolution screen and the same amazing battery life. This could be the 2021 G Power’s biggest problem.The Moto G Power doesn’t have real water resistance to lean on, but the plastic body should survive most drops and dints. With care, the phone should last a standard two-year cycle, though at the end of that two years it will probably start seriously slowing down.Not in this price range. The Moto G Power is far from perfect, but at $250 it’s about as close as you’re going to get."

4,Motorola Edge (2021),Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/motorola-edge-5g-uw-2021-review/,"The Motorola Edge 5G UW (2021) is a Verizon-only handset (largely identical to the unlocked model currently available) that delivers more than you might expect based on its midrange pricing. It looks more like its siblings in the 2021 Moto G lineup than its immediate predecessor, the Motorola Edge (2020), but looks can be deceiving. It packs in a super-responsive 144Hz display, an impressive main camera, and enough juice in the battery to keep going for days between charges.While there’s more good than bad, Motorola did stumble a few times here. There’s no support for wireless charging, the single speaker produces underwhelming results, and the downside of a screen this big is that the phone will just be too cumbersome for some people to use comfortably.The Motorola Edge 5G UW (2021) is the Verizon-exclusive version of the second-generation Motorola Edge, and it’s a sharp departure from the first generation of the hardware that launched last year. That phone had a bold curve to the edges of the display and zero bezel on the sides, while the second generation of the hardware looks a lot more like Motorola’s other 2021 phones. It features a big 6.8-inch LED display that dominates the front of the handset, but the bezels are fairly chunky all the way around. The top bezel is too thin to house a camera sensor, so it has a pinhole cam.The overall construction of the Edge 5G UW feels solid, with a silky-smooth 2.5D glass screen with the barest hint of a curve, and a clear plastic back that looks and feels a whole lot like glass in the hand. It weighs in at just a bit over 7 ounces, which feels deceptively light for a phone that measures 6.5 x 2.9 x 0.35 inches. That’s likely due to the use of plastic in construction, but it neither looks nor feels cheap at all.The volume rocker and power button are both located on the right edge of the frame, with the power button pulling double duty as a fingerprint sensor. The sensor worked flawlessly during my time with the phone. It never misread my thumbprint even once, and it’s incredibly responsive as well. Tap the sensor with your thumb, and the response is so close to instant that my eyes can’t tell the difference.The left edge is clean and bare, the top features a microphone, and the bottom edge houses the SIM drawer, another microphone, the USB-C port, and the single speaker grille.The glass-like plastic back is beautiful, but it’s also an absolute fingerprint magnet. When wiped clean with a microfiber cloth, it catches the light in a way that’s almost a shame to cover up with a phone case. Motorola calls the color scheme nebula blue, and it’s the only color option on offer for this model.The camera array rises from the back of the case a few millimeters, which makes the phone a bit wobbly when you set it down with the screen facing up. The three camera sensors are arranged vertically, with a microphone and flash located to the side.The Edge 5G UW features a big 6.8-inch FHD+ LCD  display that’s a bit of a downgrade — and also a bit of an upgrade — from the previous generation of the hardware. The first-generation Edge had a 6.7-inch OLED with a 90Hz refresh rate, while the Edge 5G UW (2021) has a 6.8-inch IPS LCD with a blistering 144Hz refresh rate and a slightly higher pixel density.It’s a shame to lose the OLED, but the faster refresh rate and higher pixel density are absolutely worth the trade-off.It’s a shame to lose the OLED, but the faster refresh rate and higher pixel density are absolutely worth the trade-off. Everything from menu navigation to games looks slick beyond belief — to the point where it’s almost difficult to go back to a phone with a significantly lower refresh rate.Sound is a completely different matter, as the Edge 5G UW fails to impress in that area. It has a single down-firing speaker that just doesn’t sound good. When I fired up the game Genshin Impact, I immediately cringed when a character started talking, and the speaker screeched and struggled to handle the high register.Volume isn’t an issue, as the speaker is more than loud enough, but it’s unpleasant at max volume. At lower volumes, it’s hollow and tinny. If you accidentally block the grille of the single bottom-firing speaker, the sound is muffled into nothingness.While the speaker itself is a disappointment, the listening experience is completely different if you connect a Bluetooth speaker or earbuds. The Edge 5G UW supports Verizon Adaptive Sound, which is Verizon’s version of spatial audio. I connected my AirPods Pro and my Pixel Buds to test the feature, and it makes a big difference. The bass boost mode is similar to the Pixel Buds bass boost option, but Verizon Adaptive Sound provides you with a number of presets and a customizable equalizer as well.The Edge 5G UW features a 108MP main camera sensor, which is a massive upgrade over the previous generation of the hardware. That’s backed up by an 8MP ultrawide camera and a 2MP depth sensor. Around front, you’ll find a decent 32MP selfie shooter.The 108MP main sensor turns in extremely strong results given decent lighting, with brilliant color and excellent details. Shots also turned out pretty good in mixed lighting conditions, like landscape photos that included bright swaths of sky and deep shadows on the ground. In lower lighting conditions, like dim light inside, I noticed more noise than I’d like. The same is true of night mode shots, which came out plenty bright even in relatively dark conditions, but at the price of a lot of grainy noise.The front camera works well enough for selfies and video chat, but it doesn’t turn in the kind of results I expected just from the raw numbers. I noticed a lot of grain in shots taken in anything less than perfect lighting, but details came out pretty good. Portrait mode washes out both colors and details, softening and lightening everything.The camera comes with a number of fun and useful options beyond portrait mode. Spot color lets you pick one color and have everything else in the shot rendered in grayscale, cutout lets you capture images of people with the background automatically cut out, and dual capture lets you snap a shot with the main camera and selfie cam at the same time — just in case that’s something you ever wanted to do.The Edge 5G UW ships with Android 11, and it’s pretty close to a stock experience. Motorola adds some functionality on top, with the same focus on gestures that it’s had for a while, but most things work the way you would expect.The biggest thing to overcome if you’re coming from a stock Android experience is that dragging up from the bottom brings up the app switcher instead of the app drawer. To get the app drawer, you have to drag up from just slightly above the bottom of the screen. You can also access Assistant by dragging up from the bottom-left or bottom-right corners of the screen.The gesture controls allow you to perform useful tasks like grabbing a screenshot by tapping the screen with three fingers.The most important change Motorola makes to stock Android is the addition of motion and gesture controls. These controls can be toggled off if you don’t like them, but the gesture controls allow you to perform useful tasks like grabbing a screenshot by tapping the screen with three fingers, turning the flashlight on with a chopping motion, and opening the camera with a quick twist of the wrist.Navigation is snappy and silky smooth, and apps launch fast. Overall performance is excellent, leaning on the Snapdragon 778G chip and your choice of 6GB or 8GB of RAM. The unit I tested came with 6GB, which was enough to have a dozen apps open with zero slowdown when swapping between them.The Edge 5G UW turned in some decent benchmark results that dovetail perfectly with my hands-on experience. It scored a hefty 13,249 overall in the Work 3.0 benchmark, which is almost twice the score I saw earlier this year when I looked at Motorola’s less expensive 5G option, the Motorola 5G Ace. I also ran a couple of 3DMark gaming benchmarks, and the Edge 5G UW doubled the performance of its lower-priced sibling there as well.For a bit of hands-on testing of gaming performance, I used the Edge 5G UW to run through my Genshin Impact dailies. While I prefer the desktop version of the game for anything serious, it looks and plays great on the Edge 5G UW. I was able to knock out my dailies without issue and even log some time in the Moonlight Merriment event. My only complaint is that the single bottom-firing speaker gets blocked when gaming in landscape mode.True to the name, the Edge 5G UW supports 5G NR mmWave and Sub-6GHz on the Verizon network. Of course, it’s also still compatible with older standards like 4G LTE if you live and work in an area where Verizon hasn’t finished building out its 5G infrastructure. The area where I tested the Edge 5G UW fits that description, with somewhat spotty 5G reception, but the speeds I saw were about twice what I’m used to measuring on 4G. That’s pretty similar to the experience I had with the Motorola 5G Ace I tested earlier this year, which only supports sub-6GHz. If you do have access to Verizon’s mmWave network, you should see some pretty great speeds from the Edge 5G UW.Rounding out its wireless connectivity, the phone also supports NFC, Bluetooth 5.2, and Wi-Fi 6. Wi-Fi connectivity is solid and fast, with support for Wi-Fi calling. I was able to send and receive calls over Wi-Fi, download and stream games, and stream music and videos without any issues.For physical connectivity, the phone has a USB-C port to connect accessories and facilitate rapid charging. Motorola’s lower-priced midrange phones and budget-range handsets come with headphone jacks, but the Edge 5G UW doesn’t have one.Motorola advertises the Edge 5G UW as having a two-day battery, and that isn’t just marketing. You could feasibly drain it faster with some pretty intense usage, but I found that my relatively light use actually let me go three days between charges. When I left it to loop YouTube videos over Wi-Fi, with the screen at half brightness and the cellular radio off, the Edge 5G UW ran for just shy of 24 hours before shutting down.While the battery size and battery life are high points, the overall charging situation isn’t as positive. The Edge 5G UW does support rapid charging to the tune of 30 watts, which is an improvement over a lot of the other phones in the current Motorola lineup, and you’ll get a 30W charger packed right in the box.Other manufacturers offer faster charging in this price range, but 30W is perfectly serviceable in my experience. I was able to charge the Edge 5G UW from dead to 100 percent in about 90 minutes. Wireless charging isn’t supported at all, though, which is disappointing.The Motorola Edge 5G UW (2021)  is available exclusively from Verizon, with a release date of October 14. Pricing starts at $700 for the 256GB, though it’ll be on sale for $550. Motorola, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H also sell the unlocked model for $700, though there’s a $600 promotion price as of this writing.The Motorola Edge 5G UW is a solid midrange handset that excels in some areas and not as much in others. It lost the fancy curved-edge OLED display that the previous model had, but the IPS LCD it does have looks fantastic and boasts a truly impressive refresh rate. Overall performance is great, battery life is exceedingly long, and the camera performance is decent enough in most lighting conditions. This is one of the best affordable 5G phones of the year, with a higher refresh rate and bigger battery than other handsets in that category.Verizon Adaptive Sound adds an extra dimension if you connect Bluetooth headphones or a speaker.The bottom-firing speaker could use an upgrade, but Verizon Adaptive Sound adds an extra dimension if you connect Bluetooth headphones or a speaker. I’d also prefer to see wireless charging in a phone at this price point, and the camera performance does suffer in low light, all of which does hold this phone back a bit. This particular model is also locked to Verizon, which is a hitch if you’re married to a different carrier, but Motorola does offer an unlocked version if you’re on board with everything else and that’s your one hang up.At the promotional $550 price point, this is one of the best options on the table, though the calculus changes a bit once things revert to the $700 MSRP. If you’re looking for a phone with an exceptionally fast refresh rate on the display, that’s especially true. The Samsung Galaxy A52 is one decent option, as it offers a 6.5-inch AMOLED with a refresh rate of 120Hz and costs about $500. It does have a slightly slower processor and a weaker camera array, but it’s an extremely solid option at that price. Your next best option is the Google Pixel 5a. You won’t get the high-refresh screen, but it has a beefed-up battery and great camera capabilities, especially in low light.Aside from the standard one-year warranty, Motorola is set to provide two major Android updates along with bimonthly security updates for two years, which means the Edge 5G UW can be expected to remain up to date for about that long. The build quality is great, so it’s likely to keep working just fine well past that, but you won’t be able to count on security updates past year two, and within three years, you’ll be one version of Android behind the handsets that will be available at that time.Yes, you should consider picking this phone up, with a couple of caveats. The extremely attractive $550 price point is technically an introductory price, with the potential that the phone will be back at its $700 MSRP for the unlocked model after the launch window. The competition gets a lot stiffer the further that price climbs, so keep an eye on that if you’re buying later."
5,Motorola Edge 20,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/motorola-moto-edge-20-pro-review/,"I remember reviewing the Moto Edge in mid-2020 and really liking the design and screen, which made me excited to try the new Moto Edge 20 Pro. However, it seems Motorola has decided to move away from almost everything that made the previous model a winner, and head down average street instead. It then put the price up for good measure. It has a lot of work to do to impress, in other words.Before we go into too much detail it’s worth talking about Motorola’s naming and marketing of the latest Moto Edge series. In the U.S. you can only buy the Moto Edge (2021), which everywhere else seems to be called the Moto Edge 20. The Moto Edge 20 Pro we’re reviewing here is a higher-spec version of that phone, which is currently available in the U.K.With that cleared up, let’s talk about the Moto Edge 20 Pro.The Motorola Moto Edge 20 Pro may be the highest specification model in the new Edge range, but don’t think that automatically makes it a jaw-dropper when it comes to design. It shares the same work-a-day, functional but uninspired ethos seen on the company’s affordable phones, with nothing that will make you fall for the phone in any way. I feel nothing for the Moto Edge 20 Pro when I look at it, which to some won’t be an issue, but to others, it will push them into the waiting arms of OnePlus, Realme, or Samsung.Its chassis is made from aluminum alloy and Gorilla Glass 5 covers the screen and the rear panel, so it has the right credentials, but the flat screen makes it look old, and the slab sides make it uncomfortable to grip. Worse, they help the Moto Edge 20 Pro pull off an impressive trick of feeling thicker than the 8mm body actually suggests it should be. There is nothing pretty about putting a square camera lens above two circular ones either.There are a few odd design decisions too. The fast fingerprint sensor is set in the power key rather than under the display, presumably cutting down on overall costs, but it’s placed quite high on the body and may not fall naturally under your thumb if you have small hands. A Google Assistant button is present on the opposite side, but right at the top of the chassis. This means I haven’t pressed it by accident, but as I’ve also never pressed it intentionally either, I question why it’s there at all.On the positive side, the Moto Edge 20 Pro is light at 185 grams, plus there’s a vegan leather model available in addition to the Midnight Blue version seen in our photos, which may give the phone more personality. Otherwise, there’s not much here that inspires me to pick up the Moto Edge 20 Pro, especially when beauties like the OnePlus Nord 2 and Samsung Galaxy A52 5G exist.Motorola hasn’t spared anything when it comes to the screen’s specification. It’s a 6.7-inch OLED panel with a 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution, a 144Hz refresh rate, and HDR10+ support. The 19.5:9 aspect ratio makes it wider than the 20:9 aspect ratio on the 6.7-inch OnePlus 9 Pro. It spends most of its time at maximum brightness, but I’ve still been able to see it outside on bright days without a problem.Watching video on the phone revealed the tone is dialed down too much for my personal taste. It’s not as vibrant or full of life and color as the OnePlus Nord 2’s screen and watching the overcast and wet weather conditions in Carfection’s Ferrari Roma review emphasizes its slightly dull characteristic. There’s no setting to alter the screen’s performance, aside from a Normal or Saturated color mode.It’s certainly not bad at all, and the warmer tone benefits skin for example, but it’s just not such an eye-catching performer as some of the competition. It’s let down more by a mono speaker which although powerful, doesn’t have the tone, bass, or enjoyment delivered by a good stereo setup which is common on other similarly priced smartphones. Screen responsiveness is a little strange too, with the screen sometimes recognizing up-and-down swipes as a left-to-right swipe, which is annoying when using the phone with one hand. The 144Hz refresh rate is very welcome, but I don’t notice a difference between it and a 120Hz screen.All the Motorola Moto Edge phones released this year — the Edge (2021)/Edge 20, Edge 20 Lite, and Edge 20 Pro — have 108-megapixel main cameras, but here on the Pro it’s joined by a 16MP wide-angle camera and an 8MP periscope telephoto camera with a 5x optical zoom. This makes the Edge 20 Pro quite unusual, with periscope zoom cameras rarely being used outside of very high-end phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.The photos it takes are inconsistent, and for every few good photos, it takes one that’s pretty poor, especially in low light. There’s a substantial difference in color balance and dynamic range between the main and wide-angle cameras. Shooting at 5x zoom takes advantage of the optical image stabilization, and the results are better than a 5x digital zoom by showing more detail and a better dynamic range, but it doesn’t come close to the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Motorola touts a 50x Super Zoom mode, but it really shouldn’t have done as there’s no stabilization at all so the image in the viewfinder moves about constantly. When you do snap a photo, you get a lovely, pixelated approximation of the subject.Low light is surprisingly bad, as even in shaded early morning conditions the f/1.9 aperture 108MP camera introduced blur where most other cameras would have no issues. There’s a macro mode with fixed focus that can make it hard to take a decent photo, 8K video recording at 24 frames per second, and a Dual Capture mode that uses both the front and rear cameras to shoot video at the same time. The 32MP selfie camera takes pleasant photos with natural skin tones, even with the Beauty Mode switched on.The Moto Edge 20 Pro’s camera is typically Motorola. It provides plenty of features and some desirable tech, but the execution isn’t good enough to best take advantage of them.The Moto Edge 20 Pro uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 processor, which is a warmed-over version of the older Snapdragon 865 processor and provides greater efficiency. The Snapdragon 870 may not be the top Snapdragon 888, but you probably won’t notice much difference day-to-day. I’ve played Asphalt 9: Legends without a problem, it’s very smooth and fast, plus I’ve multi-tasked as usual, something undoubtedly helped by the 12GB of RAM inside.Android 11 is installed and like most of its phones, Motorola doesn’t add too much over the top, meaning it looks similar to Android on a Google Pixel phone. There are some gesture controls like shaking the phone to activate the flashlight. Peek Display replaces the usual, and preferred, always-on screen with a tap-to-wake system. I like the way you can see more detail from notifications by tapping and holding icons on it, but I’d much prefer the basic information to be shown all the time. Apps have worked without fault, notifications are delivered as you’d expect, and the phone performed as normal throughout my time with it.Motorola is also pushing its desktop mode, which it calls Ready For, on the Moto Edge 20 Pro, to the point where it includes the necessary USB Type-C to HDMI cable to use it in the box. It’s a nice touch. Ready For works wirelessly too, if you have a compatible screen. It works much like Samsung DeX, in that it displays a Windows-like home screen designed to increase productivity. Also, like DeX, it may not work with all Smart TVs (it didn’t connect to my Sony Android TV, for example) and to take full advantage of it you will need a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, plus a controller if you want to play games.Calls on the Moto Edge 20 Pro are decent, but I didn’t think the speaker was very good. Voices weren’t as clear as I expected, and background noise on the caller’s end seemed to interfere more than normal. This is a 5G phone, if you have coverage in your area, with dual 5G SIM slots, plus there’s Wi-Fi 6 onboard and NFC for Google Pay too. Little things aside, the Moto Edge 20 Pro gives you everything you could want from a high-end phone — cleanly designed, reliable software, and plenty of performance — with features like Ready For that may be helpful to some.The 4,500mAh battery is a little smaller than we’ve come to expect from smartphones recently, but if you don’t push the phone very hard it only sips power. On a few very light use days it stretched out to three days for me, which very few other phones do. Play games and watch video and this turns into two days of use, which is still good.Motorola’s 30W TurboPower charger is included in the box, and while a 10-minute zap of power will apparently deliver nine hours of use, according to Motorola, it doesn’t reach 100% as quickly as the fast chargers included with the OnePlus Nord 2 or the Realme GT. The Moto Edge 20 Pro doesn’t have wireless charging, which is unfortunate.The Motorola Moto Edge 20 Pro costs 650 British pounds, or about $900. It’s available to buy now in the U.K. through Motorola’s online store. You’d have to import one to own it in the U.S., and there doesn’t seem to be any immediate plans for Motorola to officially introduce it.There’s nothing wrong with being distinctly average, which is a good thing because it’s something that the Moto Edge 20 Pro excels at. It has a design that doesn’t hurt your eyes or excite your senses, a decent camera that takes photos that will never make you say wow, and a pretty screen that can’t quite match the competition. Good battery life and reliable software aren’t enough to elevate it beyond this.I’ve not had any major problems with the phone at all, but the little annoyances amplify without much to make it worth the trouble. Why Motorola abandoned the cool design and cascading screen from the Moto Edge (2020) is a mystery. This may be Motorola’s top smartphone released so far this year, but it hasn’t really been given the red carpet treatment, and this is a problem because Motorola hasn’t set the price in average territory. Phones that don’t seem average at all are yours for a chunk of money less than it costs to pick up the Moto Edge 20 Pro. At a time when competition in all areas of the phone world is incredibly fierce, average quickly becomes forgettable.Yes, and for less money. If you’re in the U.K. the OnePlus Nord 2 costs 400 British pounds, or about $550, has a visually prettier screen, a more attractive design, a capable camera, and fast charging. You miss out on the periscope zoom, but it’s not worth the considerable extra you pay to get it. The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is $500 and officially available in the U.S. and the U.K., and is similarly excellent.Alternatively, the Realme GT is worth a look at 450 British pounds, or about $620, and has a Snapdragon 888 chip, fast charging, and a decent screen and camera. The Google Pixel 5a at $450 has its advantages too, with a good camera, IP67 rating, and great software. It misses out on the high refresh rate screen, but it’s a lot cheaper.The OnePlus 9 Pro costs a little more, $969 or 829 British pounds, and if you can afford it is a better buy. The Hasselblad camera has received software updates improving it greatly since launch, it has the latest Qualcomm processor, excellent software with longer support, and a mature design.Motorola intends to deliver two major Android software updates and two years of bimonthly security updates to the Moto Edge 20 Pro. The phone has an IP52 splash resistance rating meaning it’ll be fine in the rain, but not so much if you drop it in the bath. It comes with a basic translucent TPU case in the box for additional drop protection. You can safely buy the Moto Edge 20 Pro and expect it to last two years.No. It can’t quite deliver on the promise of its specification, and there are better choices for less money."
6,Nokia XR20,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/hmd-global-nokia-xr20-review/,"Tough doesn’t have to mean ugly anymore now that HMD Global has introduced the Nokia XR20 smartphone, which it says “can withstand anything life throws at it and look great doing it.” That’s quite a bold claim when, by necessity, rugged phones usually look like they’re hidden inside a chunky, rarely very attractive case.But does this mean the XR20 is a tough phone for everyone, regardless of whether you spend time in situations where a lesser phone would be pulverized in moments or not?The Nokia XR20 effectively straddles the world of tough phones and chunkier mainstream models by avoiding protruding bumpers and slash cuts on the rear panel to symbolize ruggedness. It also sports a subtle blue hue instead of a black or yellow color scheme that just screams “danger!” While it’s obviously not a mainstream phone like the OnePlus Nord 2, it won’t only look at home covered in dust and thrown haphazardly in the cab of a piece of heavy machinery either.Just take a look at some of the details. I like the exposed aluminum metal chassis down the side of the phone and the simple X pattern on the camera module, for example. But Nokia hasn’t forgotten what the phone is really all about, despite these neat visual elements, by including a cutout for a lanyard strap, a textured polymer rear panel for more grip, and a programmable emergency button, too.One-handed use is practically impossible if you have small hands.It’s a chunky beast at 10.64mm thick and 248 grams. A slender plastic shell covers the phone, effectively looking like an ergonomic tough case on a slimmer phone and providing it with “military specification” MIL-STD-810H certification and an IP68 rating. This means it has survived drops from 1.8 meters and being in water down to a depth of 1.5 meters for up to an hour, along with resisting exposure to dust and plenty more. It has Gorilla Glass Victus over the screen.It’s a very wide phone, and one-handed use is practically impossible if you have small hands, but it’s comfortable and natural to hold as it does not have any protrusions or guard sections on the body. There’s a subtle raised lip around the screen to protect it when placed facedown, but it’s not so extreme that you feel it each time you swipe through menus.Unusually for a phone review, I’ve deliberately dropped the XR20 and put it in water, too. It’s still working as you’d expect after various dunkings and drops from waist height onto a variety of surfaces from grass to gravel. The hard plastic shell has picked up a scuff already, though, suggesting that while it looks pretty now, it may not for that long if it gets really abused. That’s the price you pay for the XR20 looking vaguely normal. I do like the confidence to be able to give it a quick, mildly soapy scrub down, though.The Nokia XR20 isn’t a catwalk model, but it’s not made only for the building site either. It definitely wants to cross into both worlds, but once we get into the rest of the phone, it becomes clear that while it’s all dressed up, the beauty is only skin deep. It’s not a criticism, just don’t mistake it for something it isn’t. If I was a surfer, weekend hiker, or someone who worked in environments that didn’t favor electronics generally, it really fits the bill. Not really as a primary phone, but certainly as a second “lifestyle-friendly” phone.The camera module may look like it contains three or four camera lenses, but in reality, it has two, with the other two spots taken up by two flash units — a dual-tone LED and a single LED. Inside a hole-punch cutout at the top center of the screen is an 8-megapixel selfie camera.The rear dual 48MP main camera and 13MP wide-angle camera setup means the XR20 is never going to be a camera superstar, and sure enough, it can’t compete with phones designed with camera performance in mind. Color balance, white balance, and dynamic range are all over the place, and rarely do two photos have the same tone. Inconsistency continues when you switch to the wide-angle.It may wear the Zeiss name, but the Nokia XR20’s ability doesn’t live up to it. It’s not worth judging it too harshly because Nokia really isn’t selling the phone as a top camera performer, and the photos it does take are mostly acceptable in decent lighting, but if you’re at all interested in taking really good photos and having some creative fun with a camera, this isn’t the phone for you.There are a lot of buttons on the Nokia XR20. The Google Assistant button on the left of the chassis is large and easy to locate, which also means you will definitely press it by accident. There’s a programmable button on the top of the phone that can be set to perform a single action like turning on the flashlight or dialing an emergency contact after a long press. It’s almost flush with the body, so it’s unlikely you’ll do this by accident.The fingerprint sensor is inside the power key and is centered on the right-hand side of the body. Annoyingly, I find my finger naturally presses the volume down key above it when picking up the phone, something not helped by the small sensor being flush and not having any texture to help locate it. It’s reliable when you do find it, and a speedy face unlock system is there as a backup.It has enough power for general tasks.A Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM makes the XR20 a midrange phone. It has enough power for general tasks, and I’ve had no problems browsing, using social networks, swiping through Google Discover, and editing photos. The difference between it and more powerful phones is mostly found in overall speed when performing tasks like starting up the phone and apps or gaming. In these instances, the XR20 is a little slower to react. It’s not annoying in most situations, but it can be when you want to multitask or just get things done quickly.You’ll also notice the power shortcomings when watching video and playing games, where there are sometimes a few stutters when watching 1080p movies. The 6.67-inch, 20:9 aspect ratio, 1080 x 2400 LCD screen has sizable bezels around it, and it sadly only has a 60Hz refresh rate. The screen sits “under” the bezel, making the design look a little antiquated. The 550 nits brightness doesn’t sound like much, but it’s legible in sunlight.Watching Carfection’s Ferrari Portofino M review reveals good viewing angles and a pleasing color palette. It’s a good screen for a midrange phone, but it’s not very modern and many mainstream phones have the more desirable higher refresh rate. There are two speakers, but the stereo separation is minimal, with most of the volume — of which there’s plenty — coming from the speaker on the bottom of the phone. The phone plays Asphalt 9: Legends relatively smoothly and doesn’t get hot. The overall weight of the Nokia XR20 means it’s not really the ideal video or gaming partner, and the Snapdragon 480 lacks the guts to impress.Android One is neatly designed and laid out in the same way as on a Google Pixel phone, so it’s very easy to use and I haven’t experienced any reliability issues.  HMD Global promises three years of version updates with the phone, and four years of security updates, which is excellent. It has 5G provided you have coverage in your area and NFC for Google Pay, plus there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack, but the Wi-Fi connection struggles to maintain a weak signal compared to other phones.The 4,630mAh battery is very strong and returns two days of life even when you’re playing games or watching videos, as well as making a few calls. It’s great to see 15-watt wireless charging included, plus there’s 18W Quick Charge 4.0 wired charging, too. However, there’s no charger included in the box, so the actual charge speeds will depend on the charger you end up using.The Nokia XR20 costs $550 is available for pre-order at B&H Photo now, and will likely be available from other outlets. In the U.K. the XR20 is available now and costs 399 British pounds/$552, or 449 pounds/$621 for the 6GB/128GB model. It’s available in either Ultra Blue as seen in our photos, and in Granite Gray.An uninspiring camera, a 60Hz refresh rate screen, and a Snapdragon 480 processor is a recipe for a phone that costs $250, but the Nokia XR20 costs $550. While it may look better than the majority of tough phones, it’s still a tough phone — and a good one — at heart, and you’re paying for the engineering and certification that goes into making it so, rather than a camera- and processor-centric spec list.The XR20 will almost certainly outlast phones that cost half as much, and still look decent when you take it out on the town.The story often ends here, meaning the ruggedness is really the only reason to buy, but that’s not quite the case with the XR20. It’s not just the body that makes it built to last — there’s real longevity elsewhere, too. HMD Global promises three years of Android version updates and four years of security updates. It’s also covered by a three-year warranty if purchased in the U.K. or Europe, complete with a one-year free screen replacement guarantee. Warranty details for the U.S. differ, and HMD Global indicates it will come with a two-year extended warranty.Combine this with the tough body, Gorilla Glass Victus, and IP68 water resistance, and you’ve got a phone made to last until 2024 and beyond. The performance may not deliver much value, but the updates and warranty do a far better job. As a second phone to use when things get muddy or rocky, the XR20 will almost certainly outlast phones that cost half as much, and still look decent when you take it out on the town.The Nokia XR20’s rugged nature puts it up against the Cat S61 and Cat S62 Pro, both of which cost more but feature Flir’s thermal camera technology and a far more traditionally rugged design. The Cat S48c is older but can be found for a far lower price, as can the recent Motorola Defy.If you want to spend around $500 on a phone without the rugged design, we recommend the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G. It does have water resistance and is made from plastic so it should be moderately hardwearing, but the screen and camera are superior to the Nokia XR20’s.As mentioned above, the Nokia XR20’s Android software will be updated for three years, and the security updates will continue on for another year after that. The warranty period varies depending on where you buy the phone, but it will potentially be covered for up to three years. That means you should safely be able to own and use the phone until at least 2024, plus it has 5G so you can take advantage of the fastest connection speeds as well.Yes, but only if “needs to withstand harsh treatment” is at the top of your wish list."
7,OnePlus 9,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/software-update-oneplus-9-pro-camera/,"The OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro offer an incredible software experience, top-end performance, and a solid camera. Despite the Hasselblad partnership, the camera experience on the OnePlus 9 series doesn’t quite live up to the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 series, but it’s still pretty good, and a whole lot better than the OnePlus 8 series.It almost wasn’t though. A bit of inside baseball — we often get phones to review before they’re actually released, with an agreement in place that we won’t reveal details of the phones. Early on in the review process, we were frankly a little disappointed with the camera on the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro. But immediately before the launch of the phones, OnePlus released a software update that significantly improved the quality of the photos that it captured.This is relatively normal, and no points against OnePlus for doing so. Part of the trade-off in getting phones early is that companies are sometimes still working on the final details to get the phones ready for customers. And why shouldn’t they, as long as the phone is the best it can be when customers get it for themselves?But what changed? Quite a bit, actually.There’s always a risk of photos looking too drab in the quest for natural colors, and while the look may accurately reflect the world we were seeing with our eyes, it’s not the world everyone wants to see in their photos. Pre-update, the OnePlus 9 Pro sometimes suffered from this problem, and it makes photos less shareable without editing.The latest update on the OnePlus 9 Pro has definitely minimized this issue, even in photos where overcast skies threaten to wash everything out. In the picture of the buildings, the dull sky doesn’t take away the redness of the doors, or the blues and whites of the paintwork, giving the photo a lovely natural balance.This is the most significant change throughout the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera — a better-balanced palette, without sacrificing the pop many want from their photos. The improvements are there, but there is also still work to be done. Some photos are still too saturated using the 3x optical zoom, and the camera still gets confused when trying to focus on objects in the foreground. But otherwise, it’s a well-judged step forward over the early camera software I used for my review.Before the update, the OnePlus 9 wasn’t bad. It was just a little boring. Colors were a bit muted, low-light shots didn’t have much detail, and nothing really popped. Once the update hit, much of what you think of when you think of image processing was just…better.Chief among those improvements were upgrades to how the OnePlus 9 handles color. The OnePlus 9’s camera still wasn’t the most consistent out there, but on a good day, colors are much more vibrant and interesting. Greens are nice and lush, especially as a backdrop to the colors of a flower. That’s not to mention the improvements to dynamic range that make for a brighter image overall.Night mode photos also seem a fair bit better. The main issue with Nightscape photos before the update is that they weren’t all that detailed, and often ended up a little noisy. Nightscape still doesn’t quite compare to the night modes on Galaxy or iPhone devices, but it’s not far off — and it’s a whole lot better than it was a year ago.I’ve mentioned a few times that the OnePlus 9 still doesn’t quite compare with Galaxy devices or iPhones, and the main reason is that to me, it’s not as consistent. Sometimes, the phone is able to capture beautiful photos. Other times, it just falls a little flat. This is potentially something that could be improved through software updates. Either way, I appreciate the focus that OnePlus is putting on the camera, and I hope it continues along that trajectory.We received the software update with enough time to include the latest camera capabilities in the OnePlus 9 review, but not with enough time to include it in the OnePlus 9 Pro review. However by the time you read this, our OnePlus 9 Pro review will have been updated to reflect that the camera has been improved."
8,OnePlus Nord 2 5G,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review/,"The OnePlus Nord 2 is a particularly important new smartphone because it’s the first time OnePlus has released a phone without a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip inside. The Nord 2 uses a customized version of MediaTek’s Dimensity 1200 flagship chip, and it’s arguably the company’s highest-profile partnership yet, at least outside of Asia. While OnePlus will obviously be looking for success, MediaTek will also be watching closely.Furthermore, it’s a big moment for the Nord range. The original Nord managed to return OnePlus to its value-based roots but lacked identity. OnePlus has given the Nord 2 identity, but oddly, by doing so, it has accidentally created another OnePlus 9 phone, leaving me questioning what the Nord range is all about.There’s plenty riding on the Nord 2, then, so what’s it like? I’ve spent four days with the phone, which is enough time for a detailed preliminary assessment but not quite enough for a final, in-depth review. I’ll return to this review after more time with the Nord 2, and therefore the score given at this time may change depending on how the phone continues to perform.Let’s talk about the color of our review model. It’s called Blue Haze, and it’s utterly stunning. OnePlus usually gets its colors right, but this is perhaps its best yet. The aquamarine hue has a glossy finish but doesn’t attract fingerprints at all, and smudges are very effectively disguised by the Gorilla Glass 5 panel. It stays looking clean and sharp.The camera module uses the same shade but reflects light differently due to it not being made from glass, and it adds a lot of character to the back of the Nord 2. The glass even manages to hide the ugly legal text that has to be stamped on the back. I think the Nord 2 looks fantastic, and I like how it fits in with the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro’s design, making it feel like part of the family.Another crucial family mark is the Alert Slider on the side of the Nord 2, which lets you quickly switch between Silent, Vibrate, and Ring modes. It’s fast and convenient, and it’s a feature that separates OnePlus from other brands. The presence of the slider and the pretty design makes it look and operate like a true OnePlus phone, something I felt the OnePlus Nord CE did not do.The construction — a fiberglass frame with a “metalized” finish — and size is basically the same as the first OnePlus Nord, with a 73mm width and 8.2mm thickness making the phone easy to handle and use with one hand. It feels solid and substantial, and the modest 189-gram weight ensures its pocketable without being annoying.There’s no water-resistance rating, but I’ll vouch for the Nord 2’s durability. It’s quite slippery, and on the first day using it, the phone slipped out of my pocket and crashed down onto paving slabs. It survived with only the slightest mark in the top-right corner of the chassis. The glass rear and the screen are fine. I may have gotten lucky, so a case is advisable if you have a tendency to drop slippery phones.I found the first Nord to be a little faceless, but OnePlus has changed that for the Nord 2, effectively turning it into a OnePlus 9 Lite. That’s not a bad thing, and really, it’s the name that would suit the Nord 2 better. Leaving the Nord name to cheaper models like the Nord CE, which lack crucial OnePlus elements, may be a better strategy.Confused branding aside, the Nord 2 is well-proportioned, well-made, and — provided you get one in Blue Haze — an absolute beauty, too.It’s a 6.43-inch, 20:9 aspect ratio, fluid AMOLED screen on the Nord 2, complete with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 2400 x 1080 resolution. It doesn’t seem to have HDR10+ certification like the Nord, but it does have two artificial intelligence (A.I.) modes called AI Color Boost and AI Resolution Boost. However, these only work with certain apps. Both cooperate with YouTube, but AI Color Boost otherwise only works with MX Player Pro and VLC, while AI Resolution Boost works with Snapchat and Instagram.The Nord 2’s screen is lovely, and its similarity to the 9 Pro makes the phone highly desirable.The screen is brighter and more vibrant than the screen on the Nord CE, and when watching video, there’s surprisingly little to split between it and the OnePlus 9 Pro. The AI Color Boost does amp up the saturation, taking it beyond the 9 Pro. Turn it off, and it’s not quite as eye-catching. The AI Resolution Boost is less noticeable since so much YouTube content is available above 1080p already.When not watching video, the Nord 2’s screen isn’t as bright as I’d like but still legible outdoors in sunlight. This aside, the Nord 2’s screen is lovely, and its similarity to the 9 Pro makes the phone highly desirable. Audio comes from stereo speakers that are astonishingly loud but not very refined. I had no wish, and actually no need, to take it over about 40% volume.OnePlus’s Oxygen OS user interface, version 11.3, is installed and based on Android 11. It’s the same as the OnePlus 9 Pro for the most part, but there are some odd differences in the settings. For example, on the OnePlus 9 Pro, you can change the ambient display, icons, and font in the Customization menu, while on the Nord 2, you do it under the Personalization menu. Performance is great so far, with smooth scrolling through apps and menus.My review phone has received one software update since I started using it, and I’m still in the process of assessing the software and its everyday reliability.The Nord CE’s camera was inconsistent, and the first Nord’s camera suffered from poor performance. The Nord 2’s camera improves the specification over both with a 50-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS) and an 8MP wide-angle camera with electronic image stabilization (EIS). A 2MP monochrome camera completes the rear setup, along with a 32MP selfie camera also with EIS.I’ve only taken about 100 photos with the Nord 2 so far, so deeper insight is still to come. However, at this stage, it’s obvious the Nord 2 is an improvement over the Nord and the Nord CE, but because OnePlus always takes a little while to really refine the performance of its cameras, there are still a few problems, but updates are likely to arrive to address them.The Nord 2’s focus, color management, and dynamic range are mostly very good. Sunny day shots outside can introduce a little oversaturation, while edge enhancement and processing can be harsh and noticeable. There are differences in exposure between the main and wide-angle cameras, but it’s not drastic. OnePlus annoyingly adds quick access in the camera app to a 2x and 5x zoom, but these are digital zoom modes, and quality really suffers. It’s worth noting the selfie camera, as it has a lovely natural tone with plenty of detail.So far, the Nord’s camera has taken some great shots that are highly shareable without any editing, but it has also disappointed with its aggressive processing. The camera performance has not been factored into the score yet. It’s also worth remembering that the camera has not been worked on by Hasselblad, unlike the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro.The Nord 2’s focus, color management, and dynamic range is mostly very good.The MediaTek Dimensity 1200 that OnePlus uses for the Nord 2 is the first to come out of MediaTek’s Dimensity Open Resource Architecture (adorably known as DORA) initiative, which lets the phone maker tweak the chip to better work with the hardware. There’s a choice of 6GB, 8GB, or 12GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB storage space. My review phone is the 12GB/256GB version.During the time I’ve been using the Nord 2, a software update has improved the performance and reliability of the phone, which was a little shaky at first. Nothing terrible — notification support was hit-or-miss, and some apps were slow — but the issues seem to have been solved now. I’ve played Asphalt 9: Legends and haven’t noticed any slowdown or problems that affect gameplay. It does get a little warm to the touch after about an hour, though.I’ve not put the Dimensity 1200 through its paces yet, but for everyday tasks, it hasn’t made itself known at all. This may sound like a downside, but it’s not. Good processors just do their job, and we shouldn’t notice them much at all. You quickly know if a phone has a badly configured chip. It’s looking positive for the Dimensity 1200 at this stage.It does get a little warm to the touch after about an hour, though.The battery life so far suggests two days of moderate use will be possible, but if you play a game, watch video, and make video calls, then it’ll likely be down to 30% by the end of the first day. OnePlus’s super-fast Warp Charge 65T charger takes the 4,500mAh cell from flat back to 100% in less than half an hour. This is the same system used on the OnePlus 9 Pro and a step up from the Warp Charge 30T used on the Nord CE.I haven’t tested the 5G connection yet, but it’s good to see both slots in the dual-SIM carrier support it. The fingerprint sensor under the screen is fast and reliable, but it’s not as instantaneous as the OnePlus 9 Pro’s sensor. There’s face unlock, too, and it’s very quick to respond.The OnePlus Nord 2 will launch on July 29 in the U.K., Europe, and India. There’s no indication of a U.S. launch at this time. It will cost 399 British pounds and be sold through OnePlus’s own online store, Amazon, John Lewis retail stores, and the Three and O2 networks.The OnePlus Nord 2 is either at the top of the Nord range or the bottom of the OnePlus 9 range, which isn’t a bad position to be in. It takes a lot of what I like about the OnePlus 9 models — pretty design, great screen, good performance and software, very fast charging, and the Alert Slider — then charges less for it.It’s a great start. I still need to use the camera more, assess the battery life, try out the MediaTek-powered 5G connection, and use the phone for longer before giving a final verdict, but at the moment, the Nord 2 has impressed. I can’t help but think OnePlus would sell more if it was called the OnePlus 9 Lite, though.For a smartphone around the $500 or 400 British pound price, we recommend the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G. It has some advantages over the Nord 2 with water resistance, two-day battery life, a microSD card slot, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s similarly powerful and has a great 120Hz refresh rate screen.Alternatively, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) and Google Pixel 4a both cost around the same price and offer something different. The iPhone SE is much smaller but still provides a great iOS experience, while the Pixel 4a has a superb camera.OnePlus promises two years of version updates on the Nord 2, plus four years of security updates. For comparison, on the Galaxy A52 5G, Samsung also offers four years of security updates, plus three years of Android version updates. The phone is not water-resistant and is made of glass, but in my anecdotal experience, it has proven quite durable. It has 5G, so you can connect to the latest and fastest network, plus fast battery charging. It should easily last through the two years of guaranteed version updates.At the moment, the OnePlus Nord 2 5G can’t quite beat the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, but that may change once I’ve used the phone for longer. The score given to the phone at the moment is not final and may change. Look out for a review update very soon."
9,Oppo Find X3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oppo-find-x3-pro-review/,"The Oppo Find X2 Pro flew under the radar a little following its release, perhaps suffering from unfortunate timing, as it was announced just before the coronavirus pandemic took hold across the world in 2020. Its relatively high price and Oppo’s newness as a brand outside of China were likely also factors. None of this took away from its ability, though, so it is with welcoming arms that I’ve embraced its sequel, the Oppo Find X3 Pro.Oppo has made a phone that not only looks different, but is surprisingly compact for 2021 and, best of all, the Find X3 Pro is set to redefine how we expect the cameras on a smartphone to perform.Oppo has gone all out to make the Find X3 Pro look like no other flagship phone by using an unusual unibody design. This means the rear of the phone has been forged from a single piece of glass, with the camera module rising up and encasing the lenses in the top corner. It’s all one flowing panel, rather than separate pieces. Oppo said it took 2,000 attempts in its lab to get the process and final look exactly right.The benefits come in the device’s slim 8.2mm body and very clean shape. There really are no sharp edges on the Find X3 Pro, with the corners and sides smoothly blending through to the next panel. The curve where the aluminum chassis meets the screen is pronounced, though, so it’s not quite as comfortable to hold as the Galaxy S21+ or the Huawei P40 Pro, but the low 193-gram weight stops it from being fatiguing.While the unibody shape is very eye-catching, Oppo hasn’t been especially brave with the camera lens layout, as it’s basically a mirror image of the iPhone 12 Pro, nor with the color. My review model is in Matte Blue, and pretty though it is, it looks very similar to the Pacific Blue of the iPhone 12 Pro. What Oppo gives in terms of forward-thinking design, it takes away with these derivative elements.However, putting these small aspects aside, there are a lot of good things about the phone’s design. It is far more compact and is lighter than most other recent high-end smartphones, so it fits in my pocket without weighing me down. I can hold it comfortably at all times without it feeling off-balance. The Oppo Find X3 Pro is a svelte, classy, and modern-looking smartphone that shifts away from the trend of making flagship phones gigantic, without sacrificing screen size. The matte finish keeps it looking clean, too.Here’s where Oppo goes all Dr. Evil and starts talking about a billion colors a lot. The 6.7-inch AMOLED screen has a 10-bit color depth, or a little over 1 billion colors, and 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. Oppo then had it professionally calibrated, ensuring it makes the most of its ability and so we don’t have to mess around with tuning it ourselves. It should mean we can’t see color banding or dithering, like we may on lesser screens. The 10-bit color joins a 3216 x 1440 QHD+ resolution, a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, 1,300 nits brightness, and HDR10+ support.Oppo says the Find X3 Pro delivers the best color reproduction on any smartphone. But can our eyes really tell on a screen this size? Before addressing this, it’s worth saying how beautiful the Find X3 Pro’s screen is generally. It’s extremely close in performance to the Samsung Galaxy S21+, just not quite so bright when compared directly. Certainly for watching videos on YouTube and Netflix, it looks superb. But what about the 10-bit color?Frustratingly, Oppo doesn’t tell you how to get the best from the screen, but after checking with Oppo, I was told the Vivid screen setting is the default profile for the 10-bit color management. I was also sent some HEIF, or high-efficiency, photos to assess, and when placed alongside the iPhone 12 Pro, they certainly looked fantastic. But if your photos are not in the compatible format, they don’t look any different, so the value is limited. Watching several videos said to be shot with a 10-bit-capable camera and comparing it alongside the Galaxy S21+, I think there were differences, with slightly less banding visible on the Find X3 Pro, but this could easily be my eyes playing tricks, simply because you really, really have to look closely to see anything “different.”A 10-bit DCI-P3 screen on a smartphone is technically very impressive, but I’m not convinced of any actual benefit to anyone watching general content. This doesn’t change the fact the Find X3 Pro’s screen still looks fantastic.There’s more talk of 1 billion colors when we get to the camera, which is the way owners of the phone will be able to directly exploit the Find X3 Pro’s 10-bit color screen, because you can take 10-bit color photos and video on it. This is done by flicking a switch in the Settings menu, so you can take photos in either 10-bit or normal mode. Take them in 10-bit, and the images are saved as High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF) files, which may cause some compatibility problems for viewing and editing.The 10-bit color “feature” feels hugely geeky, and relevant to only a small amount of hardcore photographers at the moment, and it’s also a distraction from what actually makes the Find X3 Pro’s camera desirable — its use of two primary cameras. The 50-megapixel Sony IMX766 sensor is used for both the main wide-angle and the ultrawide camera, meaning color and balance is consistent across both cameras, a common complaint against other wide/ultrawide camera setups. These two cameras are joined by a 13-megapixel telephoto camera with a 5x hybrid zoom and a 20x digital zoom, plus an unusual 3MP Micro lens to take “microscope” photos at 60x zoom.I’m several hundred photos into using the Find X3 Pro, and it’s the real deal. Not only does it take beautifully balanced photos with stunning dynamic range and color management, but it does so across both the main and ultrawide cameras.The wide-angle example seen here with the bench underneath the tree would have looked very different taken on another phone. Instead, it’s almost indistinguishable in terms of balance, shadow, and color from the standard photo. Wonderful. It’s also very hard to fool the camera into behaving badly, as you can see in the photo shooting into the sun.What about the Micro lens 60x microscope camera? It gets insanely close, just like a microscope, to take macro photos like you’ve never seen before. The example below is of moss. It’s a pure gimmick, but it really does do something no other phone camera can do, and although the results aren’t the greatest quality, it’s possible to have some real fun with it. It’s definitely not a reason to buy the phone, but it’s a welcome change from a useless 2MP macro camera just to fill space.What about the 10-bit color mode? I don’t have a 10-bit color monitor, as I suspect many other people don’t either, so even though my Mac Mini M1 can open HEIF files, they look exactly the same on my screen as non-10-bit shots. Just forget the 10-bit talk, and rejoice that the Find X3 Pro’s camera truly delivers what we’ve wanted for a while: Consistency across the main and wide-angle cameras, which is a significant step forward in mobile photography.The Oppo Find X3 Pro uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space, plus it comes with 5G connectivity, Wi-Fi 6, and a 4,500mAh battery. Oppo’s ColorOS user interface, version 11.2 built over Android 11, is onboard. It’s better than ever before, but still frustrates and is less polished than rival systems from Samsung, OnePlus, and Google.For example, by default, it spreads apps over multiple home screens, iOS-style, then leaves you to clean up when you switch to a Drawer layout. Notifications aren’t always consistent, with the lock screen not always showing new alerts, and on some occasions the camera app refused to work.However, ColorOS is highly customizable, so many aspects can be altered. I don’t like the standard squared-off icons, but this can be changed in the Settings menu, along with the layout and design of the always-on display, the font, the colors, and the shape of the shortcut icons in the notification shade. None of this is essential, and isn’t pushed on you either, but it’s great to have such control over the look if you want it.Oppo installs an app called O Relax, and while it’s easy to ignore preinstalled apps like this, don’t do so here. It’s a comprehensive white noise machine, and if, like me, you fall asleep to white noise, it’s a brilliant tool. There are a lot of of different options, from white and pink noise to ambient sounds including jungle, city, and, my personal favorite, cosmos. Interestingly, all tones can be “remixed” with your own additions, for a personalized sound. There’s a timer so it stops whenever you want. I really like it.The Find X3 Pro’s camera truly delivers what we’ve wanted for a while: Consistency across the main and wide-angle camerasPerformance has been excellent throughout, and the Find X3 Pro Game Space mode boosts performance and minimizes distractions when playing games. Switch to Competition mode within it and Genshin Impact plays smoothly, but in the normal Balanced mode, there are some stutters. Gaming hits the 4500mAh battery hard, though, and you can expect a substantial dip when playing graphically intensive games. At first, the battery and its related software took a few days to “learn” my habits, resulting in some only average performance during my early use. After about a week, the Find X3 Pro settled down to deliver about two days of moderate use. On days with around three hours of screen time, but no gaming, the Find X3 Pro often still has 60% battery remaining at midnight.Oppo has added its massively fast SuperVOOC charging, with the 65-watt system delivering a full charge in just 35 minutes. We tested this in the past and once again on the Find X3 Pro, it works exactly as described. The sheer speed encourages me to change my charging habits, and not simply leave the phone plugged in overnight. The Find X3 Pro also has 30W wireless charging and 10W reverse charging.The Oppo Find X3 Pro has been announced for the U.K., where it starts at 1,099 British pounds, or about $1,527 U.S. It will be released on April 14 and sold unlocked through Oppo’s own online store, and with a contract through all major carriers. Oppo does not sell its phones in the U.S., but they are available for import.The Find X2 Pro was Oppo’s best phone to date, and the Find X3 Pro has focused on the right aspects in a meaningful way, ensuring it takes the crown from its predecessor. It impresses with its camera and compact, lightweight design. The consistency from the standard and ultrawide camera is immediately noticeable, and gives you a lot more confidence when taking pictures, plus the overall performance is good.I’ve enjoyed the Find X3 Pro a lot because of this, and because it’s just so neatly designed. There’s no fuss, and it’s not awkward to hold, or so heavy that it takes two hands to use. Oppo has the design and the size exactly right. However, the price is still a little on the high side, and the 10-bit color screen and camera features don’t have much relevance to regular people.The Find X3 Pro’s price puts it up against the Galaxy S21+ and the iPhone 12 Pro, both of which are cheaper. We’d recommend the iPhone 12 Pro over the Find X3 Pro, but if you’re set on a new Android phone, we’d point you toward the Galaxy S21 Ultra. It’s slightly more expensive, but like the iPhone 12 Pro, it has superb all-around performance, an extremely capable camera, a stunning screen, and more consistent software. It also faces competition from the forthcoming OnePlus 9 Pro, which is likely to also undercut it on price.The phone is made from glass ,so a case is advisable if you’re a “dropper,” but handily Oppo provides an attractive silicon case in the box. It even comes in a matching blue color. The Find X3 Pro has an IP68 water-resistance rating for further peace of mind. There’s 5G on board to ensure it connects to the fastest possible network should it be available, but the bands for this may well only be tuned for the U.K. and Europe, so consider this if you plan to import one to the U.S.The software on the phone is up to date at the moment, and Oppo’s guarantees at least two Android version updates, and two years of security patches too, both from the date of the device’s launch. This isn’t quite as comprehensive as Samsung’s security and software update schedules.Yes. Oppo’s almost perfectly sized Find X3 Pro has a camera that sets it apart from the rest, and the consistency of results makes it easy to fully enjoy its ability."
10,Pixel 5a,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/best-google-pixel-5-deals/,"Finding some great Google Pixel 5 deals can be difficult. If you are already a Google Pixel fan familiar with Google Pixel smartphone deals, you may have been waiting for someone to start tracking the best cheap Google Pixel 5 sales, and we have you covered there. The Google Pixel 5 may be tough find on sale, especially if you are looking for a CDMA version to use with Verizon, U.S. Cellular, or other wireless carriers that do not use GSM SIM cards. The good news is that retailers have started their Black Friday deals earlier than ever this year. It’s the perfect opportunity to get the Google Pixel 5 for cheap, or any smartphone for that matter, and early too — with is a welcome change with the chip and supply change shortages!It’s a shame that Google Pixel 5 deals are so hard to find. In our Digital Trends Google Pixel 5 review, we praised its compact and lightweight design. The Pixel 5’s 90Hz screen is specced for truly flicker-less performance.The Google Pixel 5 battery life answered a complaint with the four previous generations. If you configure the Google Pixel 5 in Extreme Battery Saver mode, the Pixel 5 can run for up to 48 hours per charge. That impressive run time answers complaints about battery life in our original Google Pixel review, Google Pixel 3 review, and Google Pixel 4 review. The slight exception was in the Google Pixel 2 review, where the best our reviewer could say was that it had “average battery life” — faint praise indeed. So a 48-hour maximum battery time per charge answers a previously consistent failing.Another area where the Google Pixel 5 gets high marks is its virtual armada of on-board cameras. The front camera for selfies doesn’t break any records with its 8-megapixel image capture. On the rear, however, Google equipped the latest Pixel smartphone with dual 12.2MP cameras and a 16MP camera. Can you say “ultrawide angle”? The rear camera setup draws fully-deserved praise.In summing up the Google Pixel 5, our review wrote, “The Pixel 5 represent[s] the best of Google’s software and hardware prowess, all crammed inside a compact, lightweight, but slightly dull-looking body.”Unfortunately, as noted above, even if you think the Google Pixel 5 is the best next smartphone for your needs, your chances of finding one to buy are slim, even at full list price.Here’s some background on what’s going on. Unlike Apple and Samsung, each of which manufacturer millions if not tens of millions of each new-generation smartphone, Google uses a different playbook. Compared to Apple and Samsung, Google manufacturers a limited number of devices of each model, and most generations have had only two or three models, unlike the other brands.Also, with both Apple and Samsung, when a new model announcement gets close, both companies start selling existing-generation phones at steep discounts. They also continue to manufacture previous phones, at least for a while. Google acts differently.When Google Pixel phones start to become scarce, or, as in the current case, nearly impossible to buy, that has historically meant that Google is about to drop a new generation or at least a new model.So, when the latest-generation Google Pixel launched last fall, the smart, immediate move was to search for Google Pixel 4 deals, which you can actually still find. Fortunately, the Pixel 4 family is still an excellent choice, although it, too, may be hard to find if you’re looking for a 5G version. The Google Pixel 4a may be the best Pixel cell phone you can still find new today.It is possible to find some Google Pixel 5 sales, though. You can find unlocked Google Pixel 5 deals for AT&T or for international use, but there are no steeply discounted deals. Even refurbished Pixel 5 smartphones cost close to their original list price. If your goal is to find the best Google Pixel 5 deals, your best bet at this time may be to wait for the next Google Pixel model rumored to launch this fall. Google plays close to the vest, but while some expect a Google Pixel 5a announcement, the majority opinion is that we can expect Google to skip directly to the next generation with the Google Pixel 6."
11,Pixel 6,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-tensor-2-pixel-7-processor-2022/,"The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro aren’t even in the hands of most customers yet, but Google is already working on its next-generation Tensor 2, as reported by 9to5Google, in the lead-up to the likely launch of the Pixel 7 next year.After partnering with Qualcomm for nearly a decade, Google got into the chip-making business with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, both powered by its Tensor chip that the company built in collaboration with Samsung. The new report claims that “Cloudripper,” a shared device platform that is said to belong to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, contains hints of a GS201 chip — a second-generation model of the original Tensor “GS101” in the Pixel 6.If Google was to be building a Pixel 7 next year, it only stands to reason that it would be working on the chip this year. There is little to be learned specifically about what Tensor 2 (or whatever it would be called) is bringing at this stage of development, however.With Tensor, Google finally joined Apple as one of the few smartphone makers who control all of the experience. Tensor is optimized for artificial intelligence and machine learning scenarios rather than raw power (though it has that in spades), allowing Google to optimize experiences like the Pixel’s Magic eraser, a faster Assistant, on-device translation, and so more. Controlling all aspects of the hardware has allowed Google to prioritize the parts of the Pixel that set it apart from other Android devices, and while power is appreciated, it’s that control that lets the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro shine.While our review of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro remains pending, the consensus around the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is that they perform right on par with some of the very best Android phones, with Tensor elevating the experience for an even smarter phone than the Pixel 5. Google already has a great start, now it just needs to capitalize on it."
12,Redmi Note 10,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-redmi-note-10s-review/,"The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S is a good smartphone, but it’s also evidence of just how important it is to consider longevity when deciding which model to buy, regardless of the price. Although it’s a strong value when discounted, as it is when this review was written, at full price you can get a better, longer-lasting 5G phone for not much more money.5G may not be for you today, but it may be tomorrow, and you’d have to upgrade from the Redmi Note 10S to get it. I’ve spent some quality time with the phone to discover if it’s worth taking the risk.The Redmi Note 10S has a plastic frame and a plastic rear panel, with Gorilla Glass over the screen, plus an IP53 splash and dust resistance rating. The 6.43-inch AMOLED screen is flat while the rear is slightly curved, and the whole thing weighs 178 grams and is 8.3mm thick. There’s a fingerprint scanner in the power key on the side of the phone, a 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom, and four cameras in the module on the back.It’s not a remarkable-looking smartphone, but it’s far from unattractive with a few standout design touches I really like, such as the use of clear plastic for the camera module which makes it appear slimmer. The plastic body provides grip and adds lightness, plus it’s comfortable to hold for extended periods of time, but it does get covered in messy fingerprints — on the front and the back — and the back panel has some unpleasant flex to it when pressed.This is why the Redmi Note 10S is so price-sensitive. It’s obviously not a premium smartphone, but it edges awfully close to being a little too cheap. No one really wants to pay much for a phone that sounds hollow when tapped, and the Redmi Note 10S does. It is a low-cost smartphone built on a budget, but this won’t matter too much if you can secure one for a low price.The main camera has 64-megapixels and an f/1.8 aperture, plus Phase Detection Autofocus, and it’s alongside an 8MP, f/2.2 wide-angle camera, plus a 2MP depth and 2MP macro camera. It’s not bad. In good outdoor conditions, it takes well-balanced photos with a lovely splash of color, provided you’re careful with the “AI” mode. Sometimes it can really enhance a picture, but in other situations it can heavy-handedly up the color, boost the contrast, and process the image to where it doesn’t look natural. It’s a gamble which one you get, unfortunately.In more difficult lighting the camera’s white balance suffers, and stormy clouds turn more blue than grey or black. Outdoor shots also lose some visual excitement and detail when the ambient light is low. The Portrait mode is effective and edge recognition is good. The selfie camera has a degree of beautification active by default, so it lightens and smooths your skin, but it can be deactivated easily.If you can get the Redmi Note 10S at the right price the camera won’t disappoint, but spend just a little more and you can get phones with much better cameras.Xiaomi chose MediaTek as its partner on the Redmi Note 10S, but it didn’t opt for a Dimensity chip to add 5G. Instead, the phone uses a MediaTek Helio G95 octa-core chip with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. My review model has 6GB of RAM. Using the phone for general purposes, like Twitter and Instagram, web browsing, some YouTube, and casual games it’s fine and doesn’t get hot or suffer from slowdown.I have played a lot of Asphalt 9: Legends during my time with the phone. I didn’t alter the default graphics settings and saw only the very occasional pause during the action. It never became bothersome, and the phone never became too hot. It’s a great little phone for casual gaming.It’s a great little phone for casual gamingI like the 2400 x 1080 AMOLED screen and the video experience too. It’s bright enough that I haven’t had issues seeing it outside in sunlight, although I do miss a high refresh rate. There are stereo speakers on the phone too, making watching video way more fun than you often find on phones at this price, but they don’t provide much bass.There’s no 5G onboard, which does affect the longevity of the phone as while you may not want the fast data connection now, you may next year. It does have NFC for Google Pay and dual-SIM support, plus a microSD card slot too. I also like the fingerprint sensor, which is well placed in the power key and quick to respond.The phone has Android 11 with Xiaomi’s MIUI 12.5.2 interface over the top. It comes with Google Play and all the usual Google services, plus a variety of Xiaomi’s own apps such as a calculator, a QR code scanner, a file manager, and the Mi Store app store. It’s identical in looks to the version on Xiaomi’s more expensive phones like the Mi 11 Ultra, and it runs smoothly and stably here. It’s customizable, the notifications can be interacted with in the notification shade, and I’ve found it to be reliable.There are some annoyances though. The Always-on screen isn’t always on at all, no matter what settings I use, and instead lights up when a notification arrives or with a double-tap of the screen. The Dark Mode is haphazard with app support, resulting in some apps not displaying properly, and I dislike the way it dims the wallpaper by default too, as it makes the phone dull to look at.The Always-on screen isn’t always on at all, no matter what settings I useNone of these things are really unique to the Redmi Note 10S and affect all MIUI phones. Version 12.5 installed on the Redmi Note 10S does seem to have improved energy efficiency though, and many of the pre-installed apps can be either hidden or uninstalled, something not always available in previous versions of MIUI. I never mind using MIUI as I expect these idiosyncrasies, but Xiaomi’s Android software is still less enjoyable to use than Samsung’s One UI and OnePlus’s OxygenOS.Turning the Redmi Note 10S off overnight saw the 5,000mAh battery last for three days with general use, and that includes using the camera, social networking, a video call and a few voice calls, and other basic phone tasks. Use the phone more heavily and it’ll still last two days without a problem. The battery life is a real strong point, but high-intensity tasks can drain it quickly. An hour of YouTube video at high resolution takes at least 15% of the battery life, for example.A 33W fast charger is included in the box, which Xiaomi claims delivers 54% of charge in 30 minutes.The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S is not officially sold in the U.S. but can be imported. It’s available now through Xiaomi’s official online store in the U.K., where at full price it costs 229 British pounds, which is about $320. However, at the time of writing it’s discounted to 179 pounds, or about $250.If you can get the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S for the lowest price, it’s a good value smartphone for people who won’t be demanding too much of it, or have any expectation to use 5G. It delivers strong performance for your money, with a good screen and long and battery life. The MediaTek Helio G95 processor isn’t the newest, but it’s powerful enough for everyday use and for casual gaming too. Even the camera is acceptable in the right conditions.It delivers strong performance for your money, with a good screen and long and battery lifeHowever, the lack of 5G is a problem. Cheap 5G phones are plentiful today, and they don’t all cost much more than the Redmi Note 10S. You may not be able to get 5G in your area today, but you may next month or next year, and upgrading your phone to get it at that time isn’t necessary if you choose wisely today. If you can afford to get (or have the time to save a little more) a 5G phone now, it will absolutely be worth it in the long run, and that takes the Redmi Note 10S out of the running.Yes. If you’re in the U.S. but don’t want to import the Redmi Note 10S and have about $250 to spend, we recommend the $200 Motorola Moto G Power (2021) if 5G isn’t your thing, or take a look at the $300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G or the $280 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G if it is. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but two have 5G, providing some future-proofing.In the U.K. we’d recommend spending a little more to get the OnePlus Nord CE 5G, which costs 299 pounds. The software is better, it comes with 5G for the future, has IP67 water resistance, and is equal to, or better than, the Redmi Note 10S in most other areas too. Also, take a look at the Realme 8 5G, which also has 5G from MediaTek’s Dimensity 700 chip, and costs 200 pounds.The plastic body and IP53 splash and dust resistance rating should give the Redmi Note 10S a strong chance of surviving some moderately rough treatment. This is a 4G LTE phone and does not come with a 5G modem, which means if you want to try the fast data connection in the future you will have to change your phone.No. You can get a phone with better software, and that will last longer, by spending just a little more money."
13,ROG Phone 5,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-rog-phone-5-review/,"We play video games for lots of different reasons, but one of the crucial emotions involved is excitement. Whether it’s the anticipation of finally being able to secure a new Sony PlayStation 5, winning a hard-fought race in Gran Turismo Sport, or reacting to a jump scare in a horror game — excitement is always there. The Asus ROG Phone 5 is a gaming smartphone, and if it’s to succeed in tempting mobile gamers to buy it, it needs to invoke that same level of excitement, not just when playing games, but also when holding and using the phone in general.I’ve been using the ROG Phone 5 for nearly a week. I’ll continue using it, and while I doubt my opinion will change overall, nuances will continue to be discovered, so this review will be updated in the near future. Most importantly, I didn’t need much time to feel the excitement from the ROG Phone 5.Yes, the ROG Phone 5 is big and heavy. It’s a whopping 238 grams, even heavier than the 227-gram Galaxy S21 Ultra, and 10.2mm thick. You’re going to have to accept that if you want a sleek and slim phone, it won’t be built to accommodate all the features Asus provides gamers, from multiple charging ports and a headphone jack to a 6,000mAh battery and so on.Asus has upped the visual element of the ROG Phone 5 compared to the slightly too dull ROG Phone 3 (there’s no ROG Phone 4, because the number 4, when pronounced in Chinese, sounds like the word for death and is considered bad luck). Asus adds flashes of color, a larger pixel-tastic RGB Republic of Gamers logo, and other neat design elements like the red anodized metal SIM tray. I think it looks great.Asus has adopted a central PCB (printed circuit board) design for the ROG Phone 5’s internals to help with cooling, and you may think this translates into excellent overall balance. But while the ROG Phone 5 is perfectly weighted for landscape use, it’s not so good for portrait use. You really feel the weight of the phone after awhile, something emphasized by the sheer length of the thing, which strains your thumbs when holding it to read articles, browse social media, or perform other normal phone-related tasks. It’s not made for one-handed use, due to the thickness of the chassis, and the glossy glass back panel is very slippery.The landscape orientation is extremely well-judged, though. The screen has bezels at the top and bottom, so your palms have somewhere to rest, the touch-sensitive AirTrigger sensors on the shoulder are large and easy to locate, and there is a second central USB Type-C port for charging on the lower side of the phone. This stops the cable getting in the way when playing in landscape, and is protected by a rubber port cover. It’s not very secure, and has popped out several times through normal use already, so I’m waiting for the day when it gets lost.Like other ROG Phones, there is an RGB logo on the back of the phone. It’s used to show the phone is in X Mode (a performance booster for games) and for notifications, and it’ll also activate when the screen is on if you so choose. You can set it to strobe or flash, or have it cycle through colors. The dot matrix design is more noticeable than the version on the ROG Phone 3. It’s fun, and nothing more, but I’d be exceptionally disappointed if it wasn’t there.You’re looking at a 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a 20.4:9 aspect ratio, 2448 x 1080 pixel resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, 300Hz touch sampling, HDR10+, and low 24.3ms touch latency. It’s an excellent blend of the iPhone 12 Pro’s warm, natural display and the cooler, brighter panel on the Samsung Galaxy S21+, sitting somewhere in-between the two. There’s less saturation than the Samsung screen and less warmth than the iPhone, but it still delivers a beautifully neutral and natural viewing experience.It’s all quite sensitive, though. The screen is highly tuned with a 300Hz touch sampling rate and the low 24.3ms latency, and everything feels very immediate. It’s not a complaint, as the responsiveness is welcome, but it does take a little time to get used to. The screen is a lovely thing, but only part of the story here, as it’s the audio experience that takes media on the ROG Phone 5 to the next level, and ups a lot of the excitement I wanted from the phone.Dual 12 x 16mm, front facing symmetrical speakers are set inside a chamber 35% larger than the one on the ROG Phone 3, and audio company Dirac is also back, providing the tuning. The speakers are powered by an ESS Sabre ES9280AC Pro Quad DAC with AptX Adaptive, Hi Res file support, and special optimization to widen the soundstage and lessen distortion. The result is glorious. It’s not just loud, it’s clear, controlled, and adds emotion and, yes, excitement to whatever you’re doing on the phone.The beautiful screen and stunning audio come together to generate the real excitement on the ROG Phone 5, whether you’re watching video or playing games. To get this level of clarity, depth, and pitch-perfect tone from smartphone speakers is extremely impressive, and when it’s matched to the great screen, the ROG Phone 5 elevates itself beyond most other phones, regardless of whether they were expressly designed for gaming or not. This is one of the best audio/visual mobile experiences you can get.You buy the ROG Phone 5 to play games, and the media element is only the start. It needs to have the guts to play the best games for hours on end. Asus has chosen a standard Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor — no “binned” or Plus version of the top Qualcomm chip like previous models this time — and paired it with up to 16GB of RAM. This is powered by a 6,000mAh battery, consisting of two 3,000mAh cells, with 65W HyperCharge fast charging. Those are top-end specs and make the ROG Phone 5 one of the most powerful smartphones we’ve ever used.The ROG Phone 5 caters to every gamer, from those who just want to pick up the phone and play to those who want control over every aspect of how the game plays and how the phone handles it. Put more simply, it’s suitable for everyone from keen casual gamers to e-sports players. But make no mistake, if you only occasionally play games, the ROG Phone 5 really isn’t the phone for you, as you simply won’t make use of its vast gaming ability.I’ve spent hours playing Asphalt 9: Legends, Genshin Impact, and a wide range of vertical-scrolling shooters, including Danmaku Unlimited 2 , Gunbird 2, ZeroVector, and Wind Wings. I can’t fault the performance at all. Genshin Impact runs smoothly and doesn’t stutter even when things get busy, which is the same experience in ZeroVector and Asphalt 9: Legends. It makes games highly enjoyable to play, and you can spend a lot of time doing so.However, games run pretty smoothly on most flagship phones, so what makes the ROG Phone 5 special? The screen and the audio play a massive part, as do a long list of adjustments, tweaks, and features all catering for the gamer. The AirTriggers, which are touch-sensitive shoulder buttons, are an excellent example of this. Upgraded over the ROG Phone 3’s AirTriggers, they support taps, slides, and swipes, and can be split into two, creating four AirTriggers rather than two. Mapping them to controls is simple, and the action is precise and latency is not a concern in my experience.X Mode gives almost total control over system performance and preferences, and Armoury Crate provides a central location for your games. It’s a way to connect with fellow gamers and exchange tips and converse, as well as a way to alter the phone’s state to maximize game performance to your specifications. Once you’re playing a game, the Game Genie panel can be swiped to adjust everything from the AirTriggers to the call and notification settings and more. The customization and additional features go deep, but if you’re not worried about them, they’re easily ignored.The 6,000mAh battery works hard when you’re pushing the ROG Phone 5, but it has the strength to cope. One day with five-and-a-half hours screen time, including two hours of Genshin Impact, an hour of Asphalt 9: Legends, some YouTube, and general phone tasks the rest of the time, it lasted from around 7:30 a.m. until 11:00 p.m., when it had 8% remaining. Take away the gaming and the phone has enough juice to easily last two normal days.Asus’ 65-watt HyperCharge fast charging really delivers. From 8%, it was back to 100% in about 45 minutes. That’s very impressive when you consider the large capacity of the battery. There’s no wireless charging, which Asus has never adopted on an ROG series phone due to compromises in the overall longevity of the cell, preferring to offer capacity over convenience instead. There’s also an interesting bypass charge system, which only provides power to the phone and doesn’t charge the battery, helping to lengthen the lifetime of the battery.The ROG Phone 5 has Android 11 with Asus’ ROG user interface over the top for a sci-fi look. It looks very different from Android on a Google Pixel 5, adds in all kinds of sound effects and visual flourishes, and perfectly suits the theme of the phone. If it’s not for you, Asus’ stock-looking ZenUI is there, too. Regardless of which option I used, the ROG Phone 5 had no problem with app compatibility or speed, and happily ran older games that haven’t been updated for a while — and were certainly not built for Android 11.The overall software package on the ROG Phone 5 is excellent, including all the many software features related to gaming, the choice of themes for Android, the reliability, and the other custom features such as extensive scheduling for making battery charging more efficient. If there was much more customization and features than this, the phone would run the risk of becoming too confusing. But for now, it’s just the right mix.The camera is not the focus of the ROG Phone 5, but that doesn’t mean it’s terrible. It’s a Sony IMX686 64-megapixel camera taking center stage, joined by a 13MP wide-angle camera and a 5MP macro camera. A 24MP selfie camera is set in the bezel above the screen. Features include a “lossless” 2x digital zoom, a Night mode, a Portrait mode, 8K video recording, HDR video, and a Pro mode, too.The photos are very shareable, and although I could pick away at the lack of detail in the 2x zoom shots, how color is too cool in some shots, and how the edge distortion in wide-angle mode can be distracting, there’s no point.The ROG Phone 5’s camera isn’t supposed to take on the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s camera. Instead, it holds its own against the Galaxy S21 and S21+, and that’s more than enough for a gaming-specific phone.Asus has a range of accessories for the ROG Phone 5. The AeroActive Cooler 5 adds a fan to the back of the phone to further keep temperatures down, and has been enhanced this year to lower the CPU temperatures by 10 degrees, and the surface of the phone by 15 degrees. It also has a pair of additional customizable buttons built in. The Kunai 3 controller has been updated to fit the new phone.The ROG Phone 5 is also not the only ROG Phone from Asus this year. It’s joined by the ROG Phone 5 Pro and the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate. The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a limited-edition model with a monochrome satin white finish, and is the world’s first smartphone to come with 18GB of RAM. That’s more than the Mac Mini M1 I’m composing this review on. It also has two additional touch-sensitive panels on the back of the phone, adding another two buttons for a total of 18 if you use the AeroActive Cooler 5, which comes in the box with both the Pro and Ultimate models.The biggest visual change is on the back of these two models. Both have a small PMOLED screen, called the ROG Vision, which shows custom animations. This is a color screen on the ROG Phone 5 Pro, and monochrome screen on the Ultimate phone. Buy the Ultimate model and you also get a goody pack with an ROG cap, face mask, stickers, patches, and a towel.Exact U.S. pricing will come at launch, which will be between April and June. In Europe, the ROG Phone 5 will be available to buy in March, the ROG Phone 5 Pro will come in April, and the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate will be released in May.You get a choice of configurations, with the 8GB/128GB ROG Phone 5 costing 799 euros/$948 U.S., the 12GB/256GB model costing 899 euros/$1,067, and the top 16GB/256GB version costing 999 euros/$1,185. It’ll cost you 1,199 euros/$1,422 for the ROG Phone 5 Pro, which only comes in a 16GB/256GB configuration, and the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is yours for 1,299 euros/$1,540.We recommend buying the model with the most internal storage you can afford, as there is no MicroSD card slot on the phone.Playing games on the Asus ROG Phone 5 is exciting thanks to a combination of the gorgeous screen, the superb audio, the massive power, and the many features explicitly designed to make games more enjoyable — and make you better at them. I played more games for a longer amount of time on the ROG Phone 5, and enjoyed them more, too. I’d say that’s mission accomplished for Asus.Asus isn’t shy about packing the phone with the latest tech, either. There’s almost everything you could want from a flagship phone in 2021, and when you consider the basic version should come in under $1,000, it’s decent value, too. This is a phone built for a purpose: To play the latest games without breaking a sweat, and to make the whole experience more fun and exciting along the way, and it absolutely succeeds in doing so.If you want a dedicated gaming smartphone, made by a company that understands the industry and the players, the Asus ROG Phone 5 really cannot be challenged. It’s also easily one of the most powerful smartphones out there, so there are no compromises in terms of ability.If gaming is only one part of why you want a new smartphone, and the camera is equally important, then we recommend either the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. The large screens and powerful hardware are excellent for gaming, but the cameras are also superb. If you want a phone that does everything very well, and aren’t likely to use the game-centric features of the ROG Phone 5, either would be better purchases.The processor, screen technology, and battery capacity mean the ROG Phone 5 will last for at least two years. Mobile games advance quite quickly, though, so if you’re very serious about gaming, you may find there’s a need to upgrade by then just to get the latest chipset. Everyone else will be able to continue using the ROG Phone 5 for another year at the minimum. There’s 5G onboard, too, plus Wi-Fi 6E, so you’re set for the latest connectivity tech.However, we recommend putting it in a case. Not only is the body very slippery, it’s made from glass, so it may break if you drop it. Gorilla Glass Victus over the screen should provide some additional scratch protection, though. Finally, the ROG Phone 5 is not water resistant, so you will need to be careful with it.Yes, the ROG Phone 5 is currently the ultimate gaming smartphone."
14,Samsung Galaxy A52,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-cheap-smartphones/,"A new smartphone can cost a lot of money. But you don’t always have to buy the latest and greatest. If you just use your phone to accomplish basic tasks and can’t justify buying a brand-new flagship model, there are some budget options to consider. An entry-level smartphone might not take stunning photos, but there are no differences when it comes to calls and texts. One of the best on our list, the Google Pixel 4a 5G, offers a dual-lens camera along with a large screen for all your daily needs.When you’re looking for an inexpensive phone, nowadays you don’t have to give up 5G. Our top pick here has 5G, and we’ve also compiled a list entirely of cheap 5G phones if it’s a requirement for your next purchase.We’ve compared different budget phones and selected the best devices in different price ranges. Our top picks are a great place to start if you’re in the market for a new phone and don’t want to overspend.Why you should buy this: With a modern design, solid camera, and good performance, this is the best phone for under $500.Who it’s for: Anyone that wants a powerful phone with a solid design and 5G support at a low price.Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G:The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is currently the best phone you can get for under $500. With a modern design, good performance, and a versatile and high-quality camera, this phone punches above its weight class for a device in its price range.The performance in particular is one thing that makes the Galaxy A52 5G such a great phone. The device comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor, and the 7-series has proven itself as a solid alternative to Qualcomm’s flagship 8-series. That’s coupled with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, which should be enough for most. And, there’s either 128GB or 256GB of storage, which again, is more than enough for most peoples’ files and music.Perhaps even better is how incredibly versatile the camera is. The device comes with a quad-camera system, including one 64MP main camera, one 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, one 5-megapixel macro camera, and one 5-megapixel depth camera. There’s no telephoto camera, which is a bit of a bummer, but it’s hard to complain given the price.The display experience on the Galaxy A52 5G is awesome too. The phone comes with a 6.5-inch 1080p display with a hefty 120Hz refresh rate, which should make for an incredibly smooth and responsive experience. In fact, the display on the Galaxy A52 5G is very similar to that on the much-loved Galaxy S21.Other details on offer include a 4,500mAh battery and the fact that it comes in a range of stunning colors.The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great way to get a nearly top-tier phone at a relatively low price.Our full Samsung Galaxy A52 reviewWhy you should buy this: The Google Pixel 4a offers the stock experience and awesome camera that you would expect from a Pixel device.Who it’s for: Anyone with a budget of $400 who simply wants the best phone they can buy at that price.Why we picked the Google Pixel 4a:The Google Pixel 4a costs $400 and it’s an impressive package for the money. There’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor inside with an ample 4GB of RAM. It won’t quite match higher-end chips, but it’s fast enough to run challenging games at high graphical quality, and most won’t notice a difference. You also get an excellent 5.81-inch OLED screen with a resolution of 2340 x 1080 pixels. It’s sharp, with amazing contrast, and you won’t find anything better at this price.Perhaps the biggest attraction is the camera. The Pixel 4a is packing a single lens 12.2-megapixel camera with all the same A.I. features you’ll find in the Pixel 5. Google’s flagship is our camera phone champion right now as it’s capable of capturing great shots in a wide variety of settings. The Pixel 4a might not have the same raw processing power, so image processing is a bit slower than it is on the Pixel 4 or Pixel 5, but this is still easily the best camera you’ll find anywhere near this price. The front-facing camera is rated at 8 megapixels.Naturally, Google’s Pixel 4a comes with the very latest flavor of Android and it’s guaranteed to get swift version updates and a steady supply of security patches. You’ll also enjoy super smart features like Now Playing, which recognizes music playing in your vicinity, and Call Screen, which filters out incoming spam calls for you.This phone packs 64GB of storage and it has an audio jack, Bluetooth 5.0 support, and comes with a fast charger that can restore seven hours’ worth of battery in just 15 minutes. There’s also NFC support for Google Pay, dual front-facing stereo speakers, and a fingerprint sensor on the back.The Google Pixel 4a really raises the bar for what you can expect to get for $400.Our full Google Pixel 4a reviewThe Nokia 7.2 is close to being the perfect budget phone and it’s $50 cheaper than the Pixel 3a. The build quality is superb, the 6.3-inch screen may be LCD, but it supports HDR10. Perhaps the best part of the Nokia 7.2 is the software because it runs Android One. It will get fast version updates for two years, and security updates for three years, which is rare for budget phones. Performance is solid, with the Snapdragon 660 processor and 4GB of RAM. The camera is quite capable too, combining a 48-megapixel lens with an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor.Our full Nokia 7.2 reviewWhy you should buy this: It’s affordable for an iPhone, with the same A13 Bionic processor as the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro.Who it’s for: Anyone who wants an iPhone, but has limited cash.Why we picked the iPhone SE (2020):This is the best choice for bargain-seeking Apple fans who have their hearts set on an iPhone. The new iPhone SE takes the timeless design of the iPhone 6, iPhone 7, and iPhone 8, then puts the latest Apple A13 Bionic processor inside. Yes, that’s the same one as in the iPhone 11, and iPhone 11 Pro. It’s the compact iPhone many have been waiting for.The 4.7-inch screen is sharp and clear, the latest iOS 14 software is easy to use, and you get access to an excellent library of slick apps and games, plus features like Apple Pay. The battery is only small, but it generally lasts for a day with moderate use, and there’s support for wireless charging.There is a great 12-megapixel main camera that takes sharp, crisp, natural-looking photos, and has support for Live Photos. There’s a solid 7-megapixel front-facing camera. There’s a portrait mode on the front and rear cameras too, plus support for Apple’s most recent camera improvements including Smart HDR and improved stabilization for video.There’s 64GB of base storage inside, which is sufficient for most people. The Apple iPhone SE 2020 is also IP68-rated, which means you don’t need to worry if it goes for a dunk. It’s small by modern smartphone standards, and the battery life isn’t the best, but otherwise, it still gives you that superb Apple iPhone experience for very little money.Our full iPhone SE (2020) reviewWho it’s for: Anyone who wants 5G and a relatively modern design.Why we picked the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G:The 2021 iteration of the Samsung Galaxy A series offers some killer handset options, and if you’re looking for the best phone you can get under $300, the Galaxy A32 5G is the way to go. The device offers a modern design, decent specs, and comes at an affordable price.The new Galaxy A series in general offers a solid design this year. You’ll get a small teardrop notch for the front-facing camera, along with a quad-camera module on the back that sits flush, instead of in a raised camera bump.Under the hood, the Galaxy A32 5G offers decent specs. You’ll get a MediaTek MT6853 processor, coupled with either 4GB, 6GB, or 8GB of RAM, and either 64GB or 128GB of storage. That should be more than enough for the vast majority of users.The camera looks to be relatively versatile too. The device has a quad-camera system on the back, which consists of a 48-megapixel main camera, with an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. There’s no telephoto camera, which is a little frustrating, but it’s hard to count that against Samsung in this price range.You’ll also get 5G connectivity, and while that won’t radically change your smartphone experience in 2021, it might come in handy over the next few years.If you have a strict budget of $300, then the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G will give you the most for your money right now.Who it’s for: Anyone seeking a stylish budget phone with a big screen.Why we picked the Moto G Power:The Moto G range has been our go-to budget smartphone pick for the past few years, and while Motorola is facing more competition every year, the Moto G Power is still excellent value for the money. In fact, this year’s model is even cheaper than last year’s, starting at $199. We, however, suggest buying the $249 model, which ups storage to 64GB and RAM to 4GB. It’s a great-looking phone, with a strong build and a hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera. And, it has a massive 5,000mAh battery, which should last at least two days of use.Plenty of screen real estate is a definite draw for this phone and the Moto G Power boasts a 6.6-inch display. Even though it has a 720p resolution, that lower resolution should help make the battery last even longer — and it still does the job just fine. Take a look under the hood and you’ll find a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor inside with either 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.The Moto G Power also has a triple-lens camera, with a 48-megapixel main camera with an f/1.7 aperture, a 2-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. In good conditions with plenty of light, it can capture some lovely shots and the portrait mode is great for snapping shots of friends and family with blurred backgrounds. The front-facing camera is rated at 8 megapixels.Motorola has always offered a relatively stock software experience, and that remains true with the Moto G Power. The device comes with Android 10, and while Motorola hasn’t made any announcements yet, we do expect it to eventually get Android 11.If you have a strict budget of $200, then the Moto G Power will give you the most for your money right now. It offers a big display, strong performance, and a decent camera wrapped in a stylish body.Our full Moto G Power reviewWhy you should buy this: The Moto E5 Play is ultra-affordable, and it still provides a perfectly satisfactory smartphone experience.Who it’s for: Those who want a phone capable of texting, calling, web browsing, and running social media apps without paying more than $150.Why we picked the Moto E5 Play:The Moto E5 Play is the most affordable phone Motorola offers, which means you have to accept a few compromises. For example, this phone won’t get updated to the upcoming version of Android, and the camera isn’t strong.The Snapdragon 425 (or 427 depending on the carrier) and 2GB RAM do a good job of offering manageable performance — enough to scroll through apps like Instagram and Facebook without too many problems. There’s 16GB of storage onboard, but a MicroSD card slot lets you add more if you need it. There’s also a headphone jack and a fingerprint sensor on the rear (though some carriers have models without fingerprint sensors). The software experience is very close to stock Android without a lot of bloatware, running Android 8.0 Oreo.There’s a 2,800mAh removable battery inside, and we found that it got through about a full day of use. It can stretch to two days with light usage.The Moto E5 Play is available through a variety of different carriers such as Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint — though you can’t buy it unlocked yet — for as low as $70 (the price is even lower on other carriers if you sign up for a new service).Our full Moto E5 Play reviewIt’s a bit more expensive, but as an Android One smartphone, the Nokia 2.2 will definitely get Android 10. In fact, you can expect a minimum of two years of OS upgrades and two years of monthly security updates.It has a 5.7-inch screen, a MediaTek processor, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. There’s also a 3,000mAh battery, a 13-megapixel main camera, and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. You can buy the Nokia 2.2 from Amazon.You can always find bargains at online retailers, but be careful to do your research and order the model number you need. In particular, check that the model you are buying supports the bands your carrier operates on. The major carriers sometimes run good promotions, but if you find a phone you like in-store it’s worth doing a quick search online to see if you can find it for less. You’ll often find cheaper options at MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators) and we have a list of the best MVNOs to check out.There are lots of different cell phone plans out there, so take your time and do some research before picking a plan. We have a breakdown of the best cell phone plans to help you get started. If you go for a family plan, then you can often secure good deals on additional lines. Consider the coverage in your area before deciding on a carrier.The most obvious way to score a bargain is to buy second-hand. If that appeals to you, then we have a guide on how to buy used smartphones that you’ll want to read. You may also consider online retailers, just make sure that you check the model of the phone you are buying supports the bands your carrier operates on.Flagships have been climbing in price recently, but if you’re willing to wait and look at flagship phones from a year or two ago, then you can get them much cheaper. Almost all Android phone manufacturers offer discounts on older flagships and those discounts get deeper the older the phone gets. On the other hand, the general quality of budget phones has improved greatly in recent years and phone design moves very quickly, so a midrange device today will likely match a two-year-old flagship on performance and may boast a more modern design.We’re fanatical about our phones here at Digital Trends. Every phone we test serves as our main device for at least a week, often longer, so we can get a real feel for what life would be like living with it. We read on them, game on them, shoot video and photos, navigate, organize, and occasionally even make calls. Every facet is explored, every manufacturer claim is challenged, and we’re careful to take the intended audience and price tag into account when judgment time comes.Debates on the best phones in different categories are a regular occurrence and no one on the mobile team is shy about sharing their opinion. When we find flaws, we tell like it is. Ultimately, we’ll never recommend any phone that we wouldn’t be happy using ourselves."
15,Samsung Galaxy S21,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/common-samsung-galaxy-s21-problems-how-to-solve/,"The Galaxy S21, S21+, or S21 Ultra are all fantastic phones to own, but even the best handsets can experience problems, and there’s nothing more frustrating than bugs or issues that you just can’t figure out how to solve. If your Galaxy S21 isn’t functioning as expected and you’re close to tearing your hair out, don’t worry. We’ve gathered together some of the most common problems you might experience with the latest Galaxy phones and found simple fixes for them.Want to find out more about the S21 range? Check out our Samsung Galaxy S21 review.It seems like reduced camera performance was an issue for many Samsung Galaxy S21, S21+, and S21 Ultra users out of the box, and for some users after a recent update — although the problem doesn’t seem to have affected everyone. Reports seem to indicate issues when switching between camera modes or zooming, with significant lag experienced by some users. Samsung confirmed the problem at the end of May, months after it was first reported.A firmware update fixing the issue is now rolling out for U.S. users. Early reports suggest camera performance has certainly improved following the update, but things aren’t quite perfect just yet.You’d think upgrading to a phone with 5G connectivity would ensure you always had excellent signal, but over on the Samsung forums, some S21 Ultra owners have been complaining about a poor signal. Posts suggest that for some users, the signal is poor even in areas where it used to be fine on their older phones.Although this problem doesn’t seem to be widespread, there are a few things you can try if this is affecting you.It may be your carrier has put you on their “expanded network” which means, in some areas — particularly more rural ones — your phone may not have much of a signal and you may need to use Wi-Fi for calls and texts. Of course, the issue could also be a network issue with your carrier, so it’s worth checking if there are any known issues in your area.You could also try turning on Data Roaming, which allows you to use other carrier’s connections to make and receive calls if you don’t have a good signal with your usual carrier. Note that you may be charged by your carrier for doing this.It’s also worth trying the below steps:One final note: there are some phone cases out there that can affect signal strength. It’s definitely worth taking your phone out of its case and seeing if your signal problem persists.If after all this you are still experiencing issues, it may be worth considering switching to another carrier, contacting Samsung for support, or returning your handset for a replacement.With the Galaxy S21 sporting a 4,000mAh battery, a 4,800mAh battery on board the S21 Plus, and the Ultra packing a 5,000mAh battery, it seems like Samsung’s latest smartphones are prepared for anything the day can throw at them. But some users are reporting issues with the S21 battery draining faster than expected. Most reports suggest that this is caused by the camera app draining the battery when the phone is idle — and Samsung has yet to provide a fix for the problem. You can check your battery’s status by going to Settings > Device Maintenance > Battery and viewing the Battery Usage graph. Here, you’ll be able to see if your camera or any of your other apps are draining an abnormal amount of your battery.Always check that you have the latest firmware installed on your phone, and try turning off location services via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.The S21 range features an adaptive refresh rate, which may mean that it’s using more battery life when it’s set to 120Hz. You can reduce the refresh rate manually to 60Hz, but you’ll sacrifice smoother animations. Just follow the below steps:You could also try reducing the screen resolution to give your battery a bit of a boost. Decreasing your resolution will make buttons and other items larger, but beware of venturing into blurry territory and ensure you find the sweet spot between detail and battery life. Just follow the below steps to reduce your screen resolution:If you find you are losing a lot of battery due to the Always On Display, follow the steps below to disable it:If you still find you are only getting a few hours of screen-on time from your new handset, you may need to wait for Samsung to acknowledge the problem and release a fix, or consider contacting the manufacturer or returning it for a replacement.Alarmingly, many users on the Samsung forums and XDA developer forums have reported issues with the Galaxy S21 overheating while multitasking or downloading system updates. The issue seems to be cropping up even with minimal multitasking, such as watching a YouTube video while browsing the web. It initially looked like the issue may be 5G connectivity, but users are reporting the problem persists even with cellular data turned off.It looks like Samsung has released a fix for this in the most recent update, which also addresses the camera lag issue. This should resolve the issue, but if you find your phone is still overheating following the update, we recommend ensuring you don’t leave it plugged in and charging unattended or overnight. If you’re concerned, you could contact Samsung or consider returning your handset for a replacement.If you are having issues with the S21 Ultra touchscreen registering input — as some users have reported — it can be incredibly frustrating. Double or triple tapping to get the phone to respond can leave you wondering what’s going wrong — and users have reported issues with the fingerprint sensor, too.If this is happening to you, then it’s definitely worth bearing in mind that the phone comes with a pre-installed screen protector. Some users have reported issues when installing a new screen protector without realizing one was already applied to the phone. If you’re planning on installing — or have already installed — a new screen protector, ensure you remove the one that’s on the phone out of the box.It’s also worth going to Settings > Display > Touch Sensitivity. Ensure Touch Sensitivity is toggled on, and see if this fixes the problem.If the fingerprint scanner isn’t registering your fingerprint, you can try re-registering it by following the below steps:It’s also a good idea to ensure your phone has the latest updates installed, and ensuring you’re not in a too hot or too cold environment, as this may impact the fingerprint scanner sensitivity.If you’re still experiencing issues, you can contact Samsung support.The Galaxy S21 phones all sport expansive screens, and all that screen real estate means you may find yourself touching your phone screen accidentally. Samsung provides a quick and easy way to prevent yourself from sending text messages full of gibberish or accidentally launching apps.Just follow these steps:If you’re in the U.S. and reading this, the good news is that this issue is unlikely to have affected you. But reports on Samsung’s forums suggest some users in the U.K. and Italy are experiencing issues using Samsung Pay on their new devices, and those affected also haven’t received software updates. The issue seems to be caused by having the incorrect CSC set up on the phone.The CSC is a code that’s region- or country-specific, which enables certain features for your phone. So, if your phone has the CSC for one region and you set it up in an entirely different region or country, you’re going to experience issues such as not receiving official software updates — and some features on the phone may not work.Some S21 Ultra users have also reported that Samsung Pay is unavailable on their phones. This, again, mostly seems to be affecting users in the U.K. who have installed the app only to find it’s not working, or are unable to find the app in the Galaxy Store at all.  Other users have reported trying to install the app only to be told they must wait for it to be available for their handset.Samsung has yet to acknowledge the issue, but a user in the U.K. reportedly received a fix, and reports from Italy suggest the company is rolling out a fix there, too. If you’re experiencing this issue with your phone, you can try the steps suggested in this thread.If you’re experiencing issues with Samsung Pay not working, you could also try the below steps:If this still isn’t working for you, we’d recommend contacting Samsung for support.Bluetooth can have its hiccups no matter which phone you’re using. If you’re experiencing Bluetooth issues on your Galaxy S21, try toggling the setting off, then back on again.Still a problem? You can follow these steps to reset your Bluetooth cache and clear out any existing devices.No matter how much you think you know about your phone, it never hurts to ask for help. If your specific problem isn’t on our list or the provided solutions didn’t work for you, it might be best to contact the manufacturer.

16,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review/,"Folding smartphones have a reputation, and it’s one of fragility, compromise, and expense, leaving many people to dismiss them as pricey playthings for the most eager early adopters. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 banishes that reputation thanks to a tougher body, a smaller design, and, most crucially, a lower price.Samsung considers both the Z Flip 3 and its larger sister phone, the Galaxy Z Fold 3, to be mainstream devices. But is this actually true? Yes, it really is.Take your regular mainstream smartphone, something like the Galaxy S21+ or OnePlus 9 Pro, and imagine folding it in half when you’re finished with it. That’s the Galaxy Z Flip 3. It’s not the first phone of its type, but it’s the first that will gain, and deserve, mainstream attention, all due to various enhancements made over the previous models. Therefore, it’s important to understand what benefits it brings to everyday life and the difference between using it and the Z Fold 3.They may both fold up, but Samsung’s two new foldable smartphones are very different from each other. The Z Fold 3 is all about having a bigger screen in a normal-sized phone, while the Z Flip 3 is about having a normal size screen in a smaller than usual phone. It’s not designed to be used when closed up, unlike the Z Fold 3, and its existence is one based on portability and convenience, rather than increased productivity.Living with the Z Flip 3 is not really any different from living with any other smartphone with a 6.7-inch screen, until you finish using it and go to put it in your pocket. Folding the phone up, which is in a way reminiscent of a 1990s flip phone or a makeup compact, is satisfying, different, and actually fun. The action hasn’t got old. You’ll do it without thinking about it, like clicking a pen top, and sometimes you’ll just pick the phone up and open it, despite not actually needing to use it. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a tactile, friendly, and interactive piece of mobile tech.Closed, the 4.2-inch Z Flip 3 is just over half the length of what it is when open, but is more than twice as thick at 17.1mm. It’s light at 183 grams, though. The reduced footprint means it takes up less space overall in a bag or pocket, but it’s still noticeable due to the thick case. Folded up, it’s comfortable and natural to hold, especially if you have small hands. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 really is all about convenience, and it succeeds at being way more convenient to live with than other big, modern smartphones.However, I’ve often left the Z Flip 3 open when I’m at home, which feels oddly wrong. Why? You can’t do anything meaningful with the phone when it’s closed, due to the Cover Screen not being as useful as it needs to be, so if I expected to pick the phone up again, it didn’t make sense to keep closing it. This highlights the Z Flip 3’s folding design is about portability, not usability. But not closing the Flip is a bit like telling Placido Domingo not to sing.Many people probably picture the larger Z Fold 3 — a normal phone that turns into a tablet — when thinking about folding smartphones. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is not like that at all. It’s a 6.7-inch smartphone that folds down into one less bothersome to carry around as other similarly sized, non-folding models. If you’ve ever thought “modern phones are just too big,” but never want to give up the big screen experience, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the phone for you.Samsung highlights the increased durability as one of the prime reasons why the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is ready for mainstream audiences and it’s right, but another reason is the emphasis on fashion, style, design, and fun. The Z Fold 3 puts tech before design, but the Z Flip 3 turns that on its head with an equally fun folding motion, a choice of colors, eye-catching accessories, and a delicate and stylish minimalist design. It reminds me of electric cars like the Honda E, which carefully blends modern tech with cool retro design cues for wide appeal.My review model is in cream with a silver frame, and it’s one of seven combinations in total. Each phone is two-tone, with the colored glass panels matched to a black glass camera module and a contrasting chassis color. There is a range of fun silicone covers available with straps or rings to attach the phone to a bag or lanyard, and if you buy a Galaxy Watch 4 or Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, the phone’s Cover Screen wallpaper can be set to match the watch face. This depth of personalization really suits the Z Flip 3’s fun nature.Samsung has used a tougher new aluminum it calls Armor Aluminum for the construction, along with stronger flexible glass over the screen, then given the whole thing an IPX8 rating for water resistance. It makes the Z Flip 3 more durable than previous versions. It feels like it, too. There’s no flex where there shouldn’t be, a solidity to the construction, and no obvious gaps around the hinge either. The smooth glass body makes the phone quite slippery, and it will slide out of loose pockets or across some surfaces. The chassis provides enough grip that it’s not likely to slip from your hand, though.Magnets keep the phone securely closed, the unfolding motion is smooth and almost silent, and it locks itself into place when fully open. It’s satisfying and tactile to open and close the Z Flip 3, and the action feels solid and high quality. At first, the Z Flip 3 required more effort than expected to open but after about a week of use, the hinge has loosened up. However, it’s always going to be a two-handed operation due to the hinge having enough resistance to hold the phone open at any angle.The Z Flip 3 is cuter than any smartphone really has the right to be, it feels supremely solid and well-made, and it’s a phone that makes you smile when you see it sitting around. It has also been expertly designed with some wonderful little touches such as the curved glass around the camera module, the logo stamped into the hinge that disappears when the phone is open so it becomes devoid of any branding, and the fingerprint sensor that’s  integrated into the small, slender power key. Fashion meets technology on the Galaxy Z Flip 3, and it’s done in exactly the right way.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 has two screens. On the front of the closed phone is the Cover Screen, which is a small 1.9-inch, 260 x 512 pixel Super AMOLED panel. When open, you’re looking at a 6.7-inch, 2640 x 1080 pixel, 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED screen with a 22:9 aspect ratio.Yes, there is a crease on the open screen but it’s not noticeable when the screen is active and viewed straight-on, and is barely felt when you run your finger up and down the screen. Having the phone and apps in dark mode helps if you can still see the crease and it bothers you. Dust and lint are more of a bother, as it seems to collect a lot more than other screens, especially when the phone is closed and in your pocket. The newly designed screen protector needs special mention, as it has a much more glasslike texture than older versions.The main screen is bright and detailed, the 120Hz refresh rate is beautifully smooth and effectively reduces eye strain, and video performance is up to Samsung’s usual standards. Kwon Eun Bi’s vibrant and colorful Door music video shows the high levels of contrast and strong colors, but is less natural-looking than the iPhone 12 Pro’s screen. Compare it with the Galaxy S21+ and there’s almost nothing to separate them, apart from a little more gloss and reflection from the glass of the S21+.Open, the Z Flip 3’s screen is excellent. Closed, it’s not so good. The Cover Screen is one of two downsides to the phone, and it’s all due to the software not taking full advantage of its ability. The Cover Screen is interactive, and you can swipe to the left to see music controls, the weather, the voice recorder, and a selection of other customizable widgets. Swipe right and you get a vertical list of notifications, which when tapped show plenty of detail and offer the chance to interact with them, too.However, the notifications aren’t glanceable like a normal always-on screen. The Cover Screen’s clock also doesn’t have the option to show icons for notifications, so if you miss them coming through when they show on the screen for a split second, you have to wake the screen and swipe. Leave the Z Flip 3 open and a normal Samsung always-on screen, complete with notification icons, is shown.It gets worse because the Cover Screen isn’t very responsive. It requires you to physically press the Power key to wake it up, it doesn’t always react to wake-up taps, and then takes a few beats too long to react to a swipe, lengthening the time it takes to see notifications. You can’t activate the camera from the Cover Screen either, so you have to open the phone. It’s disappointingly basic, and also pushes me to leave the phone open when I expect to do things regularly.The Galaxy Z Flip is not a camera superstar like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but its ability is similar to the Galaxy S21. There are two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one of them being a wide-angle, and both come with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS). There’s dual-pixel autofocus on the main camera, HDR10+, and up to 4K resolution video recording at 60 frames per second, but no telephoto camera or 8K video recording. There’s a 10MP camera at the top center of the screen for selfies.It’s a good camera for everyday photos and, when the situation is right, it can take some stellar ones. However, there’s some evidence of overprocessing, and the software-driven portrait mode isn’t as good as it should be. On the positive side, I took several photos of insects on flowers (don’t ask, it’s just coincidence that I took so many) and they came out very well indeed, all without much input from me at all, which is exactly what I want. The autofocus system is intelligent and accurate, which really helped.On sunny days, the colors will be too saturated for some, but I quite like the level of pop Samsung has built into the camera, and the white balance is good, too. In most situations, the balance and dynamic range stays consistent when switching between the main and the wide-angle cameras. Photos are not so good when the light is poor, and it struggles to reveal detail in shadowy areas.The autofocus system is intelligent and accurate.Samsung’s image processing can sometimes be seen at work. For example, take a look at the scene with a wire stretched across a pond, and you can see tons of edge enhancement around it, which really detracts from the photo. The portrait mode, front or rear, also isn’t very accurate and gets confused by even the most basic shapes.The Z Flip 3’s hinge supports the screen at any angle between open and closed, serving as a mini stand for the camera. Angle the hinge while in the camera app and the viewfinder shifts to the top half of the screen, where Samsung’s gesture control system lets you snap a photo without tapping a button or setting the timer, so you can do so from a distance by just showing an open hand to the camera. There’s a button to switch to the lower half of the screen if that works better, or when you’re using the rear camera, the Cover Screen can also be activated to show a preview.However, because of its shape, the preview only provides part of the image, so it’s hard to use as anything more than a basic guide. The image also stays in portrait orientation unless you turn the phone onto its side, which is less stable, and the Cover Screen then shows even less. It’s most useful when paired with Google Duo, as the video call display shifts automatically to the top half of the screen, saving you from propping the phone up against something else. However, it doesn’t work with other messaging apps like WhatsApp.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor (regardless if you’re in the U.S. or U.K., as there’s no Exynos-powered model this time) with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage space. Android 11 with One UI 3.1.1 is installed. This makes it identical to the Galaxy S21 range, and one of the highest-specced smartphones you can buy today.Performance is excellent, all apps run without a problem, and there are none of the compatibility or formatting issues that sometimes show up on large-scale folding smartphones.  The Z Flip 3 is also a great gaming phone, although it can get quite warm to the touch. Playing Asphalt 9: Legends shows off the wide display really well, and the stereo speakers provide plenty of volume and punch. However, the area on the back around the camera module is where heat is generated. It’s never too hot to touch, but it’s definitely noticeable.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 isn’t designed to hugely increase productivity, but it does have Samsung’s usual multitasking mode which, is easy to use. Just slide in the sidebar and drag the apps you want onto the main screen, where they stack vertically and allow you to use two at once. The Cover Screen gets its own Z Flip 3-specific Settings menu, where you can choose between different wallpapers and change the widgets that show when you slide across the screen.Now we come to the Z Flip 3’s other major downside — the battery. It’s a 3,300mAh cell, and it just doesn’t have the strength to compete with its peers. Even staying at home with the phone connected to Wi-Fi won’t see the battery last much longer than a full day, especially if you play a few games or watch video. Go out into the world with a 4G or 5G connection, use the phone normally, take a few pictures, and you may struggle to reach the end of the night. I have been using the phone connected to a Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, but even on the days when I haven’t, the battery was still around 25% after a regular day.If you consider yourself a heavy user, the Z Flip 3’s battery is going to be an issue. The phone supports 15-watt wired charging and 10W wireless charging, so there’s not a superfast, OnePlus-like fast-charging system to fall back on either. After years of not really needing to carry a battery pack or suffering battery anxiety on a day out, the Z Flip 3 sadly brings some of that back, and it’s at odds with its futuristic design.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 costs $1,000 for the 128GB model and it comes in cream, phantom black, green, or lavender colors. If you order directly from Samsung’s online store, however, there are three additional exclusive colors: Gray, white, or pink. In the U.S., a 256GB Z Flip 3 costs $1,050. In the U.K., the 128GB Galaxy Z Flip 3 costs 949 British pounds, or 999 pounds for the 256GB model.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the first folding smartphone with true mainstream appeal, mostly due to a price that keeps it competitive against other high-end non-folding models. It has all the performance needed today, a good camera, and a lovely minimalist design with the best party trick in mobile tech to top it all off. It hits the spot on durability, too, and while it’s not dustproof, the water resistance will really help overcome fears about it being too fragile for everyday use.Durability is no longer a serious compromise then, but a new one has reared its head and that’s battery life. Two days of moderate use is really achievable across most smartphones today, and most are equipped with 4,000mAh-plus cells. The Z Flip 3’s battery life is almost from a different era. The Cover Screen isn’t as helpful as it could be either, but Samsung may address this in a future software update.How should you think about the Galaxy Z Flip 3? Samsung has effectively taken a Galaxy S21+ and fitted it with a hinge, making it more portable and more convenient to carry around. If you’re looking at buying the S21+, or any other similar phone, you really should pay close attention to the Z Flip 3, too. Recommending a folding smartphone in this way, alongside its peers, cements the Z Flip 3’s place in the mainstream.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 stands alone if you’re specifically looking for a phone that folds in half to become smaller. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 does something similar, but serves a different need. If you want a phone that gets bigger than a “normal” phone when it’s unfolded, then you should look in its direction.Its competition comes from the usual suspects. For $1,000, you should be looking at the OnePlus 9 Pro, the Apple iPhone 12 Pro, or with the right deal, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. All provide not only exceptional performance and beautiful screens, but also better and more versatile cameras, plus much longer battery life. But they don’t fold away when you’re done with them.The Armor Aluminum increases durability by 20% over other aluminum, according to Samsung, and the IPX8 rating means the phone has been tested to a depth of 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. The X means the phone is not dust resistant, and as the water resistance is against freshwater and not seawater, the phone may not enjoy the beach much. Only time will tell how the screen and flexible glass respond to extended use, but Samsung has used a new material for the screen protector that’s more resistant to fingerprints and scratches.The Galaxy Z Flip 3’s folding design makes it about as cutting-edge as phones get.Samsung is offering a free year of Samsung Care+ with the Z Flip 3, which kicks in after the main one-year warranty and covers accidental damage from drops and provides a cracked screen repair for $249. It costs $13 per month after the first year, and can be canceled at any time. In terms of technology and software, it’s right up to date today, plus Samsung provides three years of Android software updates and four years of security updates.The Galaxy Z Flip 3’s folding design makes it about as cutting-edge as phones get, and with the durability improvements and extended warranty, plus 5G and an eSIM option alongside the standard SIM, the phone will easily serve you for three years or more.Yes. It’s the folding smartphone regular people can feel safe and confident about buying, happy in the knowledge that not only are they not really compromising by opting against buying a non-folding phone, but they’re also embracing the future of phone design today."
17,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-fold3-review/,"Foldable phones are no longer a costly toy for early adopters, and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is here to prove it. Let me be clear, the Fold 3 is still expensive at $1,800, but in its third generation of steady improvement, it’s finally a functional device for the average consumer to use and enjoy.Beyond the welcome durability improvements, the Fold 3 just feels more polished in general. The hinge is less bulky, the screen crease is less obvious, and the Under Display Camera (UDC) is easier to ignore than a hole punch. It used to be that there was a reasonably significant trade-off with folding phones compared to more mainstream flagships in terms of durability and performance. That’s not as true anymore. After almost two weeks of using the Fold 3 as my daily driver, I don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything significant compared to the Galaxy S21, though it still doesn’t match the S21 Ultra.The Fold 3 doesn’t depart radically from the design language of the Fold 2. Instead, it focuses on refinements to make it a more polished experience both visually and in your hand. In terms of footprint, the size isn’t drastically different. Unfolded, the phone measures 158.2 x 128.1 x 6.4 millimeters, with a 7.6-inch main screen – a bit bigger than the Kindle Paperwhite in terms of usable screen real estate. The weight tips the scales at 271 grams, so it’s a good bit heavier than most phones on the market, including the hefty S21 Ultra (227 grams), but certainly much lighter than a tablet.Folded, it becomes a tall and narrow “candy bar” phone measuring 158.2 x 78.1 x 14.4-16 millimeters. The thickness is about equivalent to two phones stacked on top of each other, which may seem bulky, but I found it relatively easy to use one-handed because of how narrow the 6.2-inch cover screen is. Compared to the Galaxy S21 Ultra, reaching across the entire screen with my thumb wasn’t a problem — no one-handed mode needed.Unfolded, the Fold 3 is very much a two-handed device. I keep coming back to the e-reader comparison because that’s how you have to hold it — either with both hands or with your pinkie holding up the bottom bezel. All the buttons, including the power button/fingerprint sensor and volume rocker, are located on the right side. This worked well for unlocking with my thumb since I’m right-handed, but I can see lefties having issues if they’re not comfortable using the sensor with their middle or index finger.There are quite a few durability improvements. The biggest one is IPX8 water resistance. The Fold 3 can now stand up to complete immersion in water, and sure enough, my review model survived a thorough rinsing in the sink. This is one of the bigger premium omissions that existed for foldables, so it’s nice to see it rectified. Dust can still post an issue due to the nature of the hinge, so I don’t recommend taking the Fold 3 with you for a day at the beach, but Samsung has included “sweeper” bristles inside the hinge so that dust can get forced out if it does get in. There’s also Gorilla Glass Victus on the cover screen, and the main screen has a preinstalled screen protector that Samsung claims is 80% stronger than before.This is all welcome news. For those who’ve been following foldables for some time, you’ll recall that the previous models had issues with dust getting in and the screen protector peeling off, causing scratches and other more serious damage to the screen.Upon initial setup, you are treated to a rather extensive list of ways to care for your phone. These include not pressing down too hard, only using the S Pen Fold or S Pen Pro(which have retractable tips), avoiding keeping keys and coins in the same pocket with the phone, and not removing the protective screen film. Fortunately, despite the somewhat ominous list of warnings, I never felt I had to baby it too much.Adding a case to the Fold 3 also gives it an extra bit of much-needed grip and some additional protection. After using the first-party leather case Samsung includes with the device, I found it a lot easier to hold for games, browsing, and just general day-to-day use. Other case options also come with an S Pen slot, but that wasn’t included.None of the panels on the Fold 3 fall short. When folded, the 6.2-inch cover screen has a resolution of 2268 x 832. It supports a 120Hz refresh rate like the main screen, which wasn’t on the Fold 2. I mostly used the cover screen for snapping photos with the rear camera, navigating on Google Maps, taking phone calls, and quickly checking notifications while on the go.The increased refresh rates make using the cover screen smoother and more responsive, although you’ll primarily use the main screen for multimedia. The only thing the cover screen doesn’t support is the S Pen, which makes sense since the cover screen is narrow and quite a bit smaller than the main screen. If you try to text or tweet on it, the keyboard is cramped, and most of the time, I found myself opening the main screen to do anything intensive.The main screen is where all the action is at. When the phone unfolds, what you get is a big and bright 7.6-inch screen with a resolution of 2208 x 1768, which works out to a crisp 374 pixels per inch. It’s AMOLED and supports HDR10+, so the colors are rich, saturated, and have the dense, inky blacks the panel is known for. The phone hits 1,200 nits of peak brightness, so I had no problem using it during a bright summer day at the park. Both the cover screen and main screen have excellent visibility in direct sunlight.Watching videos, playing games, and browsing are all a treat on the main screen. Games like Genshin Impact and Asphalt 9 looked incredible on the smooth and vivid 120Hz display. They also perfectly filled the screen at launch, no adjustment needed. The increased screen real estate was particularly handy in Genshin Impact since it was much easier to use the various controls without blocking parts of the screen with my fingers.The crease is present and visible, but it’s easy to ignore when there’s content on the screen. The only time I really noticed it was when the screen was off and the light was reflecting on the blank screen. The same is true for the Under Display Camera (UDC). While there’s a noticeable pixelated grid, especially on a white background, it’s easy to forget about, and it’s much less annoying than a hole-punch camera in terms of drawing your eye to it.Gaming on this phone is an absolute pleasure that’s enhanced by its audio. I rarely have strong feelings for phone speakers as they tend to be hit or miss, so I was blown away by the robust sound of the Fold 3’s stereo speakers. They’re on the top and bottom of the panel that includes the phone cover screen, so when you flip the phone around in landscape mode for games and video, you can hold it so your hands aren’t covering the speakers.The result is rich sound that balances well across lows, mids, and highs. It’s plenty loud without being tinny, and I never felt the need to reach for my headphones, which is more than you can say about most phone speakers. It won’t match quad speakers on Samsung’s own tablets like the S7 and S7+, but it can still hold its own.Not everything was perfect out of the box. I couldn’t avoid letterboxing on YouTube videos, and while it’s possible to adjust the screen to force it to fill, it ends up cutting off content along the sides, so it’s not a real solution. Despite these issues, I was still pleasantly surprised that most of the apps I used were either optimized for the Fold 3 by default or could be forced to fill the screen by enabling it in Labs (Netflix and Instagram were the main culprits).A lot of the value of the Fold 3 comes from its extra screen real estate and the customized Android 11 software that supports it. You can have multiple apps open, run them side by side in split view, or run up to three in resizable windows. Fair warning: A lot of these features are deemed experimental, and you’ll need to dig into Labs to enable them, so don’t be surprised if it doesn’t work out of the box right away.Once you have it up and running, the usage options are manifold. In my case, it was possible to watch a video or a livestream while jotting down notes or using Google Maps to navigate while still being able to text a friend when I would arrive. It’s even possible to pull up a keyboard on one half of the screen and type things out into Microsoft Word or Google Docs, almost like an old-school slider.With the addition of the Taskbar and the Edge Panel, you can get something that approximates a desktop experience, giving you access to frequently used apps whenever you want. You can also pin them together with App Pair so that they both launch together in split-screen view, drag and drop content, and move and resize windows as you please. It’s about as close to a laptop as you’re going to get on a phone, and because it supports Samsung DeX, you can get an actual desktop experience by connecting wired or wirelessly to monitors, TVs, and laptops.You can also pick app behavior for the cover screen, deciding which apps are allowed to continue to display when the main screen is closed. I enabled it for most apps, though the main one it was handy for was Google Maps, as I could keep getting directions after snapping the main screen shut. There’s also Flex mode, where apps can adjust themselves when you bend the screen. A good example is YouTube, where bending the screen at an angle to hold it upright places your video up top and the comments section below. All of this helped make the Fold 3 feel like a more seamless device with software designed and optimized for it.The productivity potential is enhanced by using the S Pen Fold Edition or S Pen Pro. It’s essential you only use either of these options because they have a retractable tip when you press too hard — other S Pen models will damage the screen.  While neither is included, I did receive an S Pen Fold with my review unit and was able to use it for notetaking and sketching. I’m not much of an artist, but being able to pull out the S Pen and seamlessly jot down a quick note, reminder, or grocery list was incredibly handy. That does bring me to the one downside, though. While having a bigger screen for using the S Pen is fantastic, there’s no place to slot it after use. So, you either need to put it in your pocket or buy a case that has a slot that can accommodate it.The productivity potential is enhanced by using the S Pen Fold Edition or S Pen Pro.Or you can do what I did and take the Fold 3 to a press event to take notes but forget the S Pen at home. It happened more often than I care to admit, which is the main reason I don’t think the Fold 3 provides the same experience as the Note, even if it’s a lot better in terms of screen real estate. Maybe once I get my hands on a Fold 3 S Pen case, I’ll feel differently.Under the hood, the Fold 3 has hardware that matches the best flagship phones on the market. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and has 12GB RAM and 256GB/512GB of storage. There’s no microSD card slot, which is a bummer, so if you’re a big power user like me, you’ll want the bigger storage configuration.I ran it through several benchmark tests, which you can see below, and it scored excellently. Multitasking is smooth and responsive, there were no slowdowns or app crashes, and, as mentioned, it handled demanding games like Genshin Impact and Asphalt 9: Legends without a problem. In terms of graphic performance, it averaged 87% better than other devices on the market.Benchmarks:While all this is great, you’ll note one spec that isn’t so hot, and it’s the 4,400mAh battery, which is a bit smaller than the one on the Fold 2. The PCMark battery test clocked in at 9 hours, 20 minutes to drain to 20%, which is equivalent to just over an average workday of runtime. I generally had to top up in the evening to keep me going. An hourlong session of Genshin Impact and some browsing could easily knock out 20% of the charge.On the upside, the phone supports 25-watt fast wired charging and 11-watt fast wireless charging, so it was easy to quickly top up with one of the many Samsung Fast Wireless charging stands and adapters I have scattered through my apartment. These aren’t included in the box, though, so you’ll have to buy your own if you want to take full advantage of the speed.The connectivity is as good as you’d expect. The Fold 3 supports 5G, Wi-Fi 6e, NFC, and has Bluetooth 5.2. I had no problem taking and making calls, browsing on 5G in the city, and connecting to accessories like the Galaxy Watch 4 and Bluetooth headphones.Camera capabilities aren’t changed from the Fold 2. On the rear, the phone has three 12-megapixel (MP) cameras: One primary sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), one telephoto for 2x optical zoom and OIS, and one ultrawide for 123-degree shots. All three cameras take great photos. Images are crisp, have plenty of detail, and minimal noise. As is typical for Samsung cameras, colors tend to get punched up a bit in terms of saturation, but I like that look.The rear sensors have more challenges in low light, cloudy, and nighttime settings, but still fare reasonably well. There’s some noise with detail shots and occasional blurriness, but for the most part, things come across clearly. The ultrawide sensor loses some crispness and clarity, though, especially in lower light, and it’s more prone to softness and noise, likely due to the lack of OIS. That’s also true of the S21 Ultra, so I’m not going to judge the Fold 3 too harshly for that.In comparison shots with the iPhone 12 Pro Max and even the older Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, the Fold 3 gets edged out. The iPhone 12 Pro Max takes more reliable, crisp, and color-accurate shots, while the S20 Ultra and its successor, the S21 Ultra, can’t be beat in terms of sheer image quality, especially for telephoto and ultrawide shots. While I would have liked a camera system comparable to the S21 Ultra or Note 20 Ultra, it’s still a very good set of sensors that most people will be happy with.The 10MP selfie camera on the cover screen is also suitable for quick selfies and handles reasonably well with decent lighting. The 4MP UDC camera on the main screen doesn’t do so hot by contrast. Most of the pictures I snapped with it were muddy, pixelated, or washed out, even though Samsung tried to do its best to clean up the image with post-processing.In the comparison shots above, you can see the difference between the 4MP sensor, the 10MP sensor, and the 12MP rear camera for selfies. The last one is your best option if sheer quality is what you’re going for. The 4MP UDC camera is only passable for video chats or if you just need it in a pinch.The Fold 3 will cost you $1,800, which is $200 less than the Fold 2 initially cost. It’s still an expensive phone, make no mistake, but the price cut makes it easier to stomach. The phone will be available at all major U.S. carriers, including AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, with various installment plans and deals available. There are also some nice trade-in options if you have older devices to spare.The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the best foldable on the market and a significant improvement over the Fold 2 in terms of durability. After three years of refinements and progress, I have much less hesitation about recommending the phone to the average user. It offers one of the best gaming experiences I’ve gotten on a phone and tons of value for multitasking and productivity.It offers one of the best gaming experiences I’ve gotten on a phone.That said, it’s not perfect yet, with room for improvement in battery life and camera performance.  It’s also still expensive at $1,800, though the price tag becomes more palatable if you think of the Fold 3 as a potential replacement for your phone, tablet, and e-reader. With all that in mind, I think that if you’re willing to spend the money and you know you’ll find value from the screen real estate, the Fold 3 is worth the purchase.Not really. Samsung dominates the foldable market, with no other competitors in sight, certainly not in the U.S. The biggest competitor to the Fold 3 is Samsung’s own Galaxy Z Flip 3, but there are some big differences between the two foldables.For starters, the Flip 3 is smaller both in dimensions and screen size, coming with a 6.7-inch screen that folds in half. The purpose of the Flip 3 is to reduce the phone’s overall footprint in your pocket with its compact clamshell design, rather than improve multitasking and productivity. It serves that purpose well, but it’s not a real competitor to the Fold 3.There are rumors of a Pixel Fold at some point in the future, and there’s also the Mi Mix Fold and the Huawei Mate X2, but neither of those are likely to come to markets outside of China. Neither the Moto Razr nor the Surface Duo were released to many accolades, and we had significant concerns in our reviews of them.Outside the world of foldables, if your primary desire is a big screen and flagship specs, both the Galaxy S21 Ultra and Note 20 Ultra have powerful hardware and S Pen support.Samsung has taken care to improve the durability of the Fold 3 by adding IPX8 water resistance, a more durable hinge with sweeper bristles, an improved screen protector for the main screen, retractable tips on the S Pen Fold and Pro, and Gorilla Glass Victus for the cover screen. Toss a case on, and you won’t feel much need to baby the phone. If you’re particularly concerned, you can invest in Samsung Care+ for an extended warranty beyond the one-year limited warranty and accidental damage protection. The crease may become more prominent over time, but I’d expect the phone to last at least two years, if not longer.Yes. The improvements to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 are big enough that I feel safe recommending them to average consumers who aren’t early adopters. There are still a few trade-offs with battery and camera performance, so if you value those two things the most, you may be better off with the S21 Ultra. Still, for gaming, multimedia, multitasking, and productivity, you won’t do better than the Fold 3."
18,Vivo X60,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/vivo-x60-pro-plus-review/,"Vivo isn’t a well-known smartphone brand outside of China, but it’s slowly making an impact with some impressive recent releases and crucial software advancements, culminating in the new X60 series. It’s the first Vivo phone to be released with Zeiss, the optics company, which has collaborated with the company on the camera, and it has a unique gimbal stabilization system too.You may not be that familiar with Vivo, but the X60 series is a big deal not just because of Zeiss’s involvement, but also because it’s part of the brand’s big push into the U.K. and Europe. I’ve been taking a look at the top device in the family, the X60 Pro Plus, and it’s a seriously desirable smartphone.At this stage, I’ve used the phone enough for an in-depth hands-on, but I still need to fully assess everyday functionality. I’ll update this review in the next few weeks, but for now have given it a preliminary score of 7 out of 10, although this will likely be revised once the review is completed.The Vivo X60 Pro Plus has a 6.56-inch AMOLED screen on the front and is slightly more compact than the OnePlus 9 Pro and the Oppo Find X3 Pro. Why do I mention these devices specifically? Vivo is part of the BBK Electronics empire, the same as Oppo and OnePlus, and each represents the current top phone from each company. All take on the same foes though, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, and the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max.It’s reminiscent of the Oppo Find X2 Pro, with a vegan leather rear panel in a subdued blue color called Emperor Blue, and a substantial camera module. The 9.1mm thickness is offset by a low 191-gram weight, and overall the Vivo X60 Pro Plus is a very comfortable phone to hold. It’s not quite as wide as the Samsung Galaxy S21+, but the curved screen means it feels more manageable. It’s very similarly sized to the Galaxy S20+.The vegan leather is pleasingly different from the endless glass rear panels, but the look and texture are slightly too glossy and are a little too “fake” looking for my taste. It’s grippy and warm to the touch though. I like the textured power button, but have no idea why Vivo decided to inscribe “Professional Photography” on the top of the phone. Apart from cheapening the look, when I see this kind of thing, it automatically makes me think the opposite, and that the phone’s camera is anything but professional.Vivo hasn’t changed the design much from the X50 Pro, aside from adding the vegan leather, and although the phone is clearly well made, the look hasn’t advanced enough and it appears slightly out-dated compared to the Galaxy S21+, the OnePlus 9 Pro, and the Find X3 Pro.Despite the X60 Pro Plus being the top phone in Vivo’s new range, the 6.56-inch AMOLED screen has an FHD+ resolution, not a QHD+ resolution. Also, unlike the Find X3 Pro and the OnePlus 9 Pro, the X60 Pro Plus has a central hole-punch selfie camera, but the in-display fingerprint sensor is once more set right at the bottom of the panel. It’s fast and accurate, but can be awkward to locate in this position.Put it alongside the OnePlus 9 Pro and you do notice the reduced resolution. Watching Carfection’s review of the BMW M4 the 9 Pro is very obviously sharper and has better color and contrast too. It’s extremely close in tone to the Galaxy S21+, which matches its resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, but the Samsung phone’s wonderful contrast and colors shine through.Given the X60 Pro Plus’s position at the top of the X60 line, a QHD+ resolution would have fitted well with the rest of the high specification. Performance is still good, but its competition has better screens.Here’s where Vivo has spent the money. The X60 Pro Plus’s camera has more features than it’s possible to test in less than a week, especially with current local movement restrictions. The main camera is a 50-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL GN1 with optical image stabilization, which Vivo also used on the X50 Pro. It’s joined by a 48MP wide-angle camera equipped with a second-generation gimbal stabilization system, with several improvements over the version fitted to the X50 Pro. A 32MP portrait camera and 8MP periscope zoom camera with a 5x optical zoom close out the array.Zeiss has co-engineered the imaging system which according to Vivo means it has tuned the camera, optimized the images for sharpness and clarity, plus supplied its Zeiss T* coating for the lenses to reduce reflections, and added its Biotar portrait bokeh style to the options available. The lens treatment shows the Zeiss involvement goes one step further than OnePlus’s partnership with Hasselblad, but Zeiss has had years of experience in smartphones, having worked with other brands in the past, most notably Nokia.The gimbal stabilization is a unique feature and works with both ultrawide stills and video, where it’s also joined by a 5-axis video stabilization system for greater overall stability. It’s very effective, particularly when tracking people or objects at 5x zoom, although it doesn’t make a massive difference when shooting general video compared to a phone with decent optical image stabilization.It’s just one of a long list of features on the X60 Pro Plus, including the 5x optical and 60x digital zoom, night modes for the standard, ultra-wide camera, and video modes, HDR video recording, various portrait modes, a video mode for capturing sporting moments, a Pro mode, an astrophotography mode, and plenty more. But what about the photos it captures? Colors are strong, there’s a fair degree of saturation, and an overall warm tone. It’s fairly consistent across the main and ultrawide cameras, and the 5x optical zoom is great.There’s a great deal to test here, but in my short time with the X60 Pro Plus, the camera takes very attractive, and most importantly, extremely shareable photos.The Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space makes the X60 Pro Plus a powerful smartphone. There’s an unusual feature called Extended RAM, where the system will take up to 3GB of the storage space and use it as RAM when required, resulting in faster app opening, and multitasking.Android 11 is installed with Vivo’s Funtouch 11.1 user interface, which is far less stylized than you may fear, but still annoyingly intrusive. After set up I’ve agreed to various multi-page privacy notices when opening apps, trying to use the search, or accidentally activating a feature because of the phone’s poor screen edge recognition. No other phone forces me to do this so much. Vivo pre-installs a lot of apps, including Snapchat, Flipkart, Amazon, and its own app store. There are also multiple apps that duplicate Google functionality, and irritating “Hot Apps” folders trying to prompt the installation of games.A 4,200mAh battery powers the phone, and is recharged using Vivo’s fast-charging 55W FlashCharge system. Assessing the performance, software, and battery takes time, and will be part of the full review update to come soon.The Vivo X60 Pro Plus is one of three X60 series phones. The X60 has a 6.56-inch AMOLED screen with a less pronounced curve, but still with a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s a Snapdragon 870 processor with 8GB or 12GB of RAM, and a 4,300mAh battery. It has a 48MP main camera, a 13MP wide-angle camera, and a 13MP telephoto with a 2x optical zoom.The X60 Pro also has a Snapdragon 870 processor, but only with 12GB of RAM, and the same screen size and resolution too, but now with the same curve as the Pro Plus model. It has a 48MP main camera, this time with the gimbal stabilization system, plus the same 13MP cameras as the X60.The Vivo X60 series will be sold in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, and Austria, along with India, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the United Arab Emirates. However, not all regions will get all the phones, or at the same time. The X60 Pro Plus will first arrive in India, for example, and the X60 Pro will be sold in Europe. Vivo has not confirmed the final release date yet.Prices are also unknown, but based on the prices in China, the X60 Pro converts over to around $690, or 500 British pounds, and the X60 Pro Plus to around $920, or 670 British pounds. If Vivo can match these prices, it’ll take the fight directly to Xiaomi and the Mi 11, which also undercuts the price of Samsung’s Galaxy S21+ and the iPhone 12.At this stage, the Vivo X60 Pro Plus has everything I’ve come to expect from a Vivo phone — an insanely feature-packed camera, and irritating software. The hardware itself is well made, but the design is smartphone-circa-2020 and doesn’t move anything forward. It would normally be easier to forgive some of these issues if the price came in at around $900 or less, but the competition this year has made it much harder for Vivo to get away with a less-than-ideal software experience in particular. I’ll continue using the Vivo X60 Pro Plus, and have a full review soon."
19,Xiaomi Mi 11,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-mi-11-review/,"If you’ve looked at the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus and shrugged, nonplussed by the decent-but-not-outstanding specifications, then the Xiaomi Mi 11 may be exactly what you’re looking for. It boasts the kind of specs and feature list that we expect from Samsung’s sensibly sized flagship S Series phones, and then charges less than even the simplest Galaxy S21 for the pleasure of owning the device.Xiaomi has long excelled in delivering strong on-paper specs coupled with a great value price, but then stumbled when it comes to usability and polish. It has a great chance to impress with the Mi 11, so has it done so?With its metal frame, curved Gorilla Glass Victus over the screen, and Gorilla Glass 5 for the back panel, the Xiaomi Mi 11 is made from exactly the materials we expect to find on a top-level smartphone today. The shade of the icy blue color on the back of my Mi 11 subtly changes when it catches the light, it doesn’t attract too many fingerprints, and the overall footprint of the phone is manageable. It’s not too heavy either, at 196 grams.The camera module on the back is unusual, not only in shape but also due to the amount of “steps” it has. There are three different levels, all in different shapes, and each with different lenses and colors, making it instantly noticeable. It’s busy in a way the lens arrangement on the S21 is not, but it certainly won’t be mistaken for any other camera array out there.Maybe it’s a good thing it looks different, as the Mi 11 otherwise doesn’t push smartphone design forward in any way. The curved glass panels meet the metal chassis in the expected fashion, there are speaker grilles at the top and bottom, there’s no headphone jack, and there are three buttons on the right-hand side of the chassis. In your hand, it feels like the OnePlus 8, the Galaxy S20+, the Oppo Find X2 Pro, and many other phones released over the past couple years.One odd part of the design concerns the bezels around the screen corners. The device edges appear to be at a slightly different angle than the screen’s edges, and once you notice, it becomes frustratingly hard not to see. Also, although the glass is curved at the sides, the screen does not extend far down them. Some may see this as an advantage, but it also means the black bezels are more noticeable than we would like.The Mi 11 has a 6.81-inch AMOLED screen with a 3,200 x 1,400 pixel resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support, and a 1,500 nits maximum brightness. This goes beyond the specs of the Galaxy S21+, and meets those of the Galaxy S21 Ultra. However, seeing as the FHD+ screen performance on the Galaxy S21+ is indistinguishable from the WQHD+ screen on the S20+, does it really matter?Putting the Mi 11 alongside the S21+, I really couldn’t see any difference when playing high-resolution videos on YouTube — but this is not a bad thing, as it looks fantastic. This version of Iz*One’s Panorama music video (below) looks sharp and stunning on both phones, with masses of color and deep contrast, perfect control during the sequences with strobing lights and fast movement, and a high brightness level. Xiaomi matches Samsung’s screen performance with the Mi 11.Xiaomi’s excellent dual-speaker system, with audio tuned by Harmon Kardon, is clear and loud, with only minimal harshness at maximum volume. The speakers are too small for much bass, but the Mi 11 has a deeper tone than the iPhone 12 Pro, and overall sounds very similar to the Galaxy S21+. It’s also great to see AptX HD and AptX Adaptive on the list of Bluetooth features, meaning the Mi 11 streams the highest-quality audio to compatible headphones. YouTube Music sounded great listening to the Vivo TWS Neo earbuds with AptX Adaptive , and there was only a small amount of occasional lag when playing games.I couldn’t find any downsides with the display itself, but was surprised at the need to activate the 120Hz refresh rate, rather than it being set by default. Some people may miss out because of this idiosyncrasy. Otherwise, the audio/visual experience on the Mi 11 is superb, and certainly comparable to the very best phones you can buy today.There are three cameras in the multilevel module on the back of the Mi 11: A 108MP main camera with a 1/1.33-inch sensor and optical image stabilization, a 13MP wide-angle camera, and a 5-megapixel macro camera. It does not have an optical zoom, but does have some unusual video camera features and can shoot 8K video, too. The 20MP selfie camera sits inside a hole-punch cutout in the screen.I’ve enjoyed using the Mi 11, confident it will take good photos, but I have missed an optical zoom feature, and have found more images need editing than on the Galaxy S21 Ultra. White balance, for example, seems to be a weak point of the camera.There’s no denying the amount of detail the camera captures, though. The photo of the pond above features a small sign on the wall in the center of the photo, but it’s only when you zoom right in that you can clearly read the “Do not leave rubbish, take it home” message. This same photo shows the Mi 11’s lovely tone, capturing the end-of-winter colors very effectively.The large sensor adds a deep, natural depth of field, and is really more effective than the haphazard Portrait mode for adding bokeh to your photos. Low light is good too. The photo of an early morning red sky still captures a decent level of detail even though the 2x setting is a digital zoom. Some edge distortion is evident in wide-angle shots, and colors are a little muted.The Mi 11’s camera, whether shooting stills or video, is a great partner.Autofocus makes the 5MP macro camera more usable than most, but it’s still not quite as good as the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s macro mode, which uses the wide-angle camera. It’s problematic because it’s a little hit-or-miss in terms of whether it focuses on what you want it to. Tapping the screen helps, but the camera never seems happy with the distance it is away from the subject, so getting everything “just right” takes time. That’s fine if your subject is stationary, and you don’t mind taking multiple photos, but not if it’s moving. Either way, you need patience, and an empty Gallery, to end up with one or two usable photos.The Mi 11 camera’s gimmick (and yes, they are gimmicks) relate to video. Hit the Movie Effects setting and you get a selection of clever, but very niche, video effects to try. Magic Zoom creates your own dolly shot (like this famous shot from Jaws), while Time Freeze holds your subject in shot while the world continues to move around it, and Parallel World folds the scene over on itself, Inception-style.Each one works quite well, and are a credit to Xiaomi’s artificial intelligence (A.I.) and software efforts, but they are only usable in very specific situations. Magic Zoom works best when there is plenty of distance between you and your subject, and it therefore needs to be quite large. Time Freeze needs people to work, and they have to be doing something vaguely interesting for it to be interesting. Restrictions on movement where I live mean these features are mostly unusable for now, but even when I do see actual people again, I can’t see these features being used aside from out of curiosity.The 8K video recording feature is available at 24 frames per second (fps) or 30 fps, and results in massive file sizes (at least 500MB per minute) and content you can only truly enjoy on an 8K television. There are plenty of other modes, too, from a 15-second Short Video setting to a Dual Video mode to shoot with both the front and rear cameras, giving you plenty to try out — just don’t expect them to be features you use every day.Xiaomi’s photo-editing mode is similarly fun, and again shows off its A.I. prowess. There’s an effective editing feature where the look of the sky can be altered, like a bokeh portrait mode for the sky, and it’s surprisingly good at completely changing the mood of a photo. The Mi 11’s camera, whether shooting stills or video, is a great partner. The features can be gimmicky, but there are plenty to have fun with occasionally, and the quality of the main camera is undeniable.My review Mi 11 has Android 11 with MIUI 12 over the top and the January 1, 2021, security patch installed. It’s the best version of MIUI I’ve used, but that’s not an unequivocal recommendation — it just means it’s not as finicky as older versions. On the positive side, it’s very pretty, very fast, and the Settings menu is mostly laid out very well. Every app I downloaded worked without a problem, and its not frustrating in terms of operation.However, there are some annoyances you don’t find on the S21+, or the iPhone. The keyboard is set right at the bottom of the phone, making it awkward to use sometimes. Notifications are presented well in the notification shade, and you can interact with them there, but I didn’t receive all of them all the time, and sometimes the phone would deliver a host of them all together when I unlocked it for another reason. There’s no “bounce” to the notification shade either, so when you flick the screen to reveal hidden messages, if there aren’t any, it simply closes the shade and throws you back to the home screen.I like the various always-on screen options, the wide range of display customizations, and the dark mode. Oddly, the dark mode adds darkness to the wallpaper, too, but this can be turned off by digging into the Settings. This is probably the biggest issue with MIUI. The endless customization means spending time to get it just right, and sometimes not being aware why something looks or functions like it does.Finding the Macro mode in the camera app is a great example of MIUI being crowded and messy. It’s not a standard setting on the option list in the viewfinder, it’s not a “flower” icon next to the wide-angle and zoom options, and it’s not hidden under the More menu. Instead, it’s under another menu at the top of the screen, which is much too easy to miss.None of these things make MIUI especially bad, they just mean the Mi 11’s software carries a steep learning curve before it really feels like home, especially if you’re coming from an operating system like iOS or Android on a Google Pixel phone.Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 chip powers the Mi 11. My review version has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but a 256GB model with 12GB RAM is also available. I can’t see why you’d need 12GB of RAM because I have never thought the phone was slow to react. I played Asphalt 9: Legends, and it’s smooth, very fast, and the screen looks wonderful. The Mi 11 is great for gaming due to the moderate weight, plus there is a gaming mode to hold notifications and silence calls.Now we come to the biggest disappointment in the Mi 11 — the battery. The 4,600mAh cell may have the capacity for a lengthy use time, and it does come with wired and wireless fast charging, but it doesn’t have the guts to last more than a full day (and even then it’s only just) when it’s under heavy use.I mostly use Wi-Fi at the moment, and even then, the Mi 11’s poor battery life showed up. A few videos, some photos, a short gaming session, and normal use outside of these things sees the battery down to 60% by early afternoon. That’s at least 20% less than I see on most other phones, including the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Take it outside and connect to a cell signal, and things are even worse.With moderate use, the battery reduces at an alarming rate, and even partway into the day, I questioned whether I’d have to charge it before I went to bed. The cell isn’t small and the phone doesn’t get hot, suggesting it’s a software optimization issue and the battery life may be improved with future software updates. Happily, there’s a 55-watt wired charger in the box that promises a 45-minute fast charge time. If you have Xiaomi’s 50W wireless charger, the charge time is still less than an hour, but this does not come with the phone.The biggest disappointment in the Mi 11 — the battery.The security systems are better, but also not perfect. The in-display fingerprint sensor sometimes needs a few beats longer than you would expect to unlock the phone, so lifting your finger too quickly results in it not opening. Frustratingly, it doesn’t happen all the time, so it’s hard to adjust your use to compensate. However, the face unlock is very fast, so you may not use the fingerprint sensor at all.Choosing the Mi 11 over the Galaxy S21 or S21+ is one thing, but getting a Mi 11 in your hands is another. Xiaomi doesn’t officially sell its smartphones in the U.S., so you’ll have to import one. Similarly, the phone has not been confirmed for release in the U.K. yet, but we imagine it will be soon, as it’s available in parts of Europe. It starts at 749 euros, which converts over to about $900 U.S., or 650 British pounds.The Mi 11 is a truly high-performance device with a fantastic screen, a capable 108MP camera, and many of the right features and specs, all at a very reasonable price. However, all this can’t quite make up for the disappointing battery life and MIUI problems around notifications and menu clutter. Xiaomi’s hardware is excellent as always, but also like we see too often, the software — although improved — can’t quite match competing phones from Samsung, Apple, and OnePlus.Yes. If you don’t want to spend $1,000 on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or iPhone 12 Pro — our two top recommendations — and want something around $700, then the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a great buy, as is the Google Pixel 5. However, if the Xiaomi Mi 11 receives a U.K. release in the very near future, it would be a great alternative to the OnePlus 8 Pro, which although excellent, doesn’t feature the latest Qualcomm chip. Its camera is not as capable as the Mi 11’s either.The Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor is right up to date, and there’s more than enough capability to keep the phone fresh for two or three years. Xiaomi’s MIUI software updates are more frequent than its Android version updates, so while it’s running the newest software now, this won’t be the case when Android 12 is released later this year, and it may take a while for the update to arrive.Unfortunately, the Mi 11 is not water resistant, and the glass body won’t be especially resistant to damage if the phone is dropped. A case would be a very good idea if you want the phone to last. The Xiaomi Mi 11 has 5G connectivity, provided you have coverage in your area.No. It’s a capable phone with plenty of good points, but the battery life is disappointing, and the additional camera features — although technically impressive — don’t add enough long-term interest. Also, you have to import it in the U.S., and it doesn’t have a final release date for the U.K. yet."
20,Asus ZenFone 7,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-zenfone-7-pro-review/,"For the ZenFone 7 Pro Asus has brought back the motorized flip camera it introduced on the ZenFone 6, but boosted its ability and feature list to make this a dream phone for the selfie lover. Everything you can do with the rear camera — wide-angle, 8K video recording, super sharp telephoto — you can do for selfies, and that makes it very special indeed.The rest of the specification has been given a bump, too, and therefore the price has gone up over the previous model, so should you still consider the ZenFone 7 Pro if selfies aren’t that important to you? Let’s find out.Asus wants to build your muscles. The Zenfone 7 Pro weighs 230 grams, considerably more than most big flagship devices, so grab this and the 240 gram ROG Phone 3 to increase the intensity of your home workout. It’s thick at 9.6mm, and you really do notice the size and bulk of the Zenfone 7 Pro when comparing it to its closest rivals, the OnePlus 8, the LG Velvet, and the iPhone 11. The weight is fairly evenly distributed, but definitely biased toward the top of the phone due to the motorized flip camera module.The camera module is a significant improvement over the Zenfone 6. It fits flush with the body and doesn’t move when you shake the phone around, mostly eliminating annoying rattles. It’s made from strong and light liquid metal but is bigger than the Zenfone 6’s, however I think it looks better because of this. The motor has been re-engineered from the original and is quiet and fast, but the software often prompts you to perform a recalibration check, especially after the phone takes a knock.The larger flip module is not the only visual improvement. The slimmer bezels around the screen give the phone a great modern look, and moving the fingerprint sensor to the side does the same. The sensor performs different functions, such as a double tap to open Google Assistant, or it can be programmed to open your own choice of app. Thankfully, the addition of new features has not affected the speed or accuracy of the fingerprint sensor, and it works very well.The back of the Zenfone 7 Pro is made of glass, but it doesn’t really feel like it, and is so slippery it feels like it has been greased from the factory. The panel is warm to the touch and surprisingly flexible, with an almost hollow sound when you tap it. The green, almost blue color is attractive, but the tactility of the panel itself is not as pleasing as the OnePlus 8 Pro or the LG Velvet, or as comfortable to hold as the Huawei P40 Pro, plus without much grip the heft means sometimes it requires two hands to hold.The glass back doesn’t feel cheap, but I do question the durability, which is a concern in a phone of this size, weight, and slipperiness. Asus may know this, as it includes two cases in the box — a rugged case, and a transparent one. I suggest you use one. The fact that the otherwise perfectly acceptable looking ZenFone 7 Pro is a serious 40 grams heavier than the ZenFone 6 is an unfortunate misstep, and makes living with it more arduous than it should be.Bigger, wider, brighter, and more colorful sums up the differences between the ZenFone 7 Pro compared to the ZenFone 6. It’s a 6.67-inch AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 20:9 aspect ratio. Asus has even employed the special tuning that makes the ROG Phone 3’s display so pretty on the 7 Pro. Asus isn’t wrong about the brightness either, it’s stunning, and even makes the iPhone 11 Pro look a little dim.It’s not quite so natural to look at though. Watching Carfection’s Ferrari F8 Spider review on YouTube the road isn’t as atmospherically gray as it is on the iPhone, and the yellow car pops off the screen with such aggression, you’ll reach for your sunglasses. If you like high-energy AMOLED screens with borderline radioactive colors, the ZenFone 7 Pro will not disappoint. Watching video does reveal the slightly tinny sound from the stereo speakers though, and it would have been great to hear the same brilliant Dirac-tuned audio from the ROG Phone 3 on the ZenFone 7 Pro.It’s worth talking about the screen’s overall responsiveness here. The 90Hz refresh rate should be considered a standard at this price, but it’s neatly augmented by a one-millisecond response time and a 200Hz touch sampling rate. What does this mean? The ZenFone 7 Pro always feels snappy, responsive, and fluid, regardless of the app you use, which along with some software optimizations for speed means the phone always feel modern and high performance.The flip camera avoids the need for a notch or hole-punch, enhancing the cinematic view. If you notice the notch or hate the hole-punch, the ZenFone 7 Pro’s pretty to look at, uninterrupted screen will be exactly what you want.The Asus Zenfone 7 Pro has the best selfie camera in the business, bar none. If selfies fill your gallery app, then this phone will give you many opportunities to get creative, with masses of features, modes, and overall ability than any other selfie camera you’ve used before. How is this possible? It’s Asus’s decision to make the rear camera the front camera, too, using the motorized flip module.What you get is a 64-megapixel Sony IMX686 main camera sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, 8K video recording, and optical image stabilization, plus a 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, and an 8-megapixel telephoto lens with optical image stabilization and a 3x optical zoom. Features include 4K time-lapse video recording, slow-motion video at 4K and 120 frames-per-second, plus special features like auto-panorama and motion tracking.To make it clear, all these features are available on the selfie camera, and the results are dramatic. Colors are vibrant, exposure is spot-on, edge detection in portrait mode is excellent, and when’s the last time you shot 8K video with a selfie camera, or took an expansive, 113-degree, ultra-wide selfie? With the ZenFone 7 Pro, you can do all this and more.The flip module itself has been redesigned and re-engineered to be tougher, faster, and more powerful. It does require periodic calibrations, but Asus says its endurance tests show it’s good for 100 flips per day for five years, making it twice as strong as the ZenFone 6’s module. It’s more adjustable too. You can move the module from flat to fully flipped in stages of 0.5 degrees, and doing so is very fluid.From an engineering standpoint, it’s a work of art, and does enable some fun features. The auto panorama feature is excellent, with very effective stitching and a truly wide scale. It isn’t immediately obvious how to best make use of the module’s adjustable angle, but once you start to experiment you notice it’s not often about the photos it lets you take, but the benefits of being able to keep the screen at an angle you can properly frame different shots, such as from low down without guessing on the framing or laying down on the ground.I’m also impressed by the consistency between the standard and wide-angle camera, with shots appearing similarly dynamic from both, although at 3x optical zoom, photos can be a little drab. It also repeatedly warns you’re too close to a subject and to move back for better focus when taking close up shots, despite the final photo being focused correctly.Overall though, I’ve really enjoyed using the ZenFone 7 Pro’s camera, and exploring how best to use its fun motorized module. I don’t feel like I’ve scratched the surface of what it can do yet either, and that’s a good feeling to have. It’s unfortunate the flip module contributes to some of the phone’s downsides — weight, and lack of water resistance for example — but there’s no denying the ZenFone 7 Pro is the phone of choice for selfie connoisseurs.The Zenfone 7 Pro uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage memory. Here’s how it performs in some benchmark tests, but the phone did not complete a Vulkan test on 3DMark, crashing part-way through. This same problem occurred on the ROG Phone 3.Geekbench 5: 3125 Multi Core/980 Single Core3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 7,706 (OpenGL)These scores are a little down on the Asus ROG Phone 3, but it does have less RAM, similar to the OnePlus 8. I played Asphalt 9 Legends and Hill Climb Racer with no issues, and the phone didn’t get hot either. However, during extended periods using a range of apps and making calls, it would get warm to the touch.Asus is stuck when it comes to 5G. If it didn’t add it, the phone would be cheaper but long-term appeal might suffer, while adding it in means accepting the price hike. Sadly, the only option was to include it, and therefore the price has gone up. 5G is for the future, with few benefits to regular consumers right now, even on the off chance there’s any 5G connectivity in an area you live.No such conundrum exists with the software, as Asus continues to build ZenUI into a neat, usable, relatively bloat-free version of Android, as we saw on the ROG Phone 3 and the ZenFone 6. Here it has a number of enhancements that increase speed, such as lowering the time it takes to start the phone to 13 seconds, and speeding up everything from loading preview images to unlocking the phone with the fingerprint sensor. It’s clean and uncluttered, and I have not experienced any problems using it.Asus talks a lot about extending battery life, not really on a daily basis, but over the lifetime of the phone itself. It presents charts and data about how overnight charging, wireless charging, mega-fast wired charging, and other battery bad habits (according to Asus, at least) reduce the cell’s capacity to hold a charge over years of ownership. For the ZenFone 7 Pro it has taken steps to reduce long-term battery degradation and help it retain capacity for longer.The cornerstone of this battery care system is a slow-charge option, where the battery is charged to 80% when you first plug it in at night, and then the final 20% is zapped in a short while before your scheduled wake-up time. You can tweak this to only charge at scheduled times, or even never charge the battery fully at all, just to protect it over time. Dive even deeper and you can shut down apps, prevent them from auto starting, and limit background activity, too.Wireless charging isn’t onboard due to Asus’s battery concerns, along with such a function taking up even more space inside the already-big phone, but that hasn’t stopped the ZenFone 7 Pro from coming with a wired fast charger. It zips to 60% in 35 minutes, and on to 100% in 90 minutes. Usage time is good, but not unbelievable. With moderate use I have gotten two days from the ZenFone 7 Pro’s battery, but heavy use with the camera, gaming, and video calls really hits it hard, and on those days at around 11 p.m. the battery was down to 5%.Make no mistake, you won’t have any single-day battery anxiety here, but don’t expect it to last two full days when you use it hard.Asus has announced the Taiwanese and European price for the ZenFone 7 Pro, but has not confirmed the U.S. price yet. It costs 799 euros, which converts over to $950. However, based on how Asus has converted prices in the past, the ZenFone 7 Pro may end up being around $799.The final release date has not been confirmed, but Asus does recognize it was difficult to find a ZenFone 6 for sale, and has said there will be greater supply for the ZenFone 7 Pro. We will update here when we find out more about U.S. availability.The ZenFone 7 Pro’s flip camera makes it absolutely the best smartphone for taking selfies you can buy. This along with the excellent software, pretty 90Hz screen, and thoughtfully added features like the battery saving tech and 8K video recording, makes the ZenFone 7 Pro good value even at a higher price than the ZenFone 6. However, if selfies aren’t your thing, the size and weight of the phone is excessive compared to others in its class.Yes. The ZenFone 7 Pro’s biggest downside is the overall size and weight of the device, and if this is a concern for you, there are several considerably slimmer and lighter phones available for around the same price. The $700 OnePlus 8 is a great everyday phone with reliable software and a good camera wrapped in a 180-gram body. The $600 LG Velvet is also 180 grams and even better looking than the OnePlus 8, has water resistance, and an excellent screen.Alternatively, the $700 iPhone 11 is still excellent, despite a replacement being on the horizon, with plenty of power, good battery life, and a capable camera. Want something a little different? Take a look at the $700 Motorola Moto Edge with its stunning screen, great battery life, and unusual design.The ZenFone 7 Pro isn’t water resistant but does come with a decent rugged case, which should protect it from too much harm. The phone’s specification is good, and Asus promises two major Android software updates will arrive on the ZenFone 7 Pro, which will include the Android 11 update due later this year from Google. However, time frames on these updates will vary. All this, along with Asus’s efforts to ensure the battery stays fresh over time, means the phone will last for several years at a minimum depending on your demands.Yes. For taking selfies, there’s no other phone that comes close to the ZenFone 7 Pro, and happily the rest of the phone impresses, too."
21,Huawei P40,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p40-pro-review/,"There’s risk in everything. From climbing mountains, crossing the street, to buying a used car, some decisions could end up going either way, good or bad. Many times, taking the risk pays off, and we’re better people for it.It’s an analogy that fits the Huawei P40 Pro. Buying it means cutting off your ties with Google and trying something different.I’ve spent several weeks with the Huawei P40 Pro. Here’s what happened when I took the risk.This phone is beautiful. Having spent the last weeks juggling the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, the OnePlus 8 Pro, and various other modern smartphones, the Huawei P40 Pro stands above them all in terms of spot-on styling, a clear identity, and sensibly made design choices.The greatest is the choice of frosted, matte-finish glass on the back. Yes, the OnePlus 8 has something like it, as does the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro, but they don’t look as fabulous as the P40 Pro.My favorite part? The way the Huawei logo reflects deep into the glass. The curved sides of the body catch the light, and the frosted silver color seen here morphs between blue, gray, white, and silver.The elegance is blighted by the monster camera bump, which gives the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra a run for its money in the “it’s how big?” stakes. It protrudes by a few millimeters, and although the lenses and sensors are neatly arranged, it draws the eye away from the simple beauty of the frosted glass.It’s one of the most comfortable phones I’ve held. It’s not sharp along the sides, and all the corners are rounded to ensure they don’t dig into your palm, but the real triumph is the rounded glass at the bottom of the screen. Swipe-based gesture controls mean you’re always swiping up from the bottom of the phone, and this is a tactile nightmare when there’s a bezel, ridge, or sharp edge there. On the P40 Pro, there is nothing but a cascading piece of glass, smoothing your finger’s progress up the screen.It makes the P40 Pro genuinely feel different from all other Android smartphones you can buy today. Only the Apple iPhone 11 Pro can match the P40 Pro’s ergonomics.On a less positive note, the P40 Pro is chunky — admittedly due to the camera sensors and battery capacity — at 9mm thick and a sizable 209 grams. Although hefty, it’s well balanced, and many other big phones this year are even heavier. For comparison, the Galaxy S20 Ultra weighs 222 grams and is 8.8mm thick, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max is 226 grams and 8mm thick.Yes, the P40 Pro is a little slippery down the edges. Outside of this, the P40 Pro is expertly designed, has genuine stylistic flair, and manages to disguise some of its weight.A 6.58-inch OLED screen sits on the front of the P40 Pro. It has a 2640 x 1200 pixel resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. There is an in-display fingerprint sensor, and face unlock, too. There is a very slim border around the display, and a slight curve down the sides. The dual-lens selfie camera is punched into the screen in the top left, and is perhaps three times the size of a standard single-lens, hole-punch camera. This means it takes away valuable screen space for notification icons, and is always noticeable when watching video.How’s video? YouTube does look great, although I had to watch through the Firefox browser (no Google apps, remember?). It still supports 2160p video without issue, but features like double-tap to advance 10 seconds do not work.Amazon Prime video can also be watched through the browser, at up to 4K resolution, as can Netflix, but the UI is not as intuitive as a native app. All look excellent, and the P40 Pro’s screen rivals the iPhone 11 Pro for detail and balance, while matching the Galaxy S20 Plus for vibrance. It’s lovely.Sadly, the sublime viewing experience is lessened by the audio. I encountered the same issue with the Huawei Mate Xs, a device even more video-focused than the P40 Pro. There’s a single main speaker on the bottom of the phone, and it’s rather tinny and uninspiring, something not helped by the sound being biased to the right of the phone. When the screen looks as good as it does, the underwhelming audio stands out even more, especially when the competing Oppo Find X2 Pro manages to get both aspects exactly right.The fingerprint sensor is set high up on the screen, making it easier to locate comfortably when holding the phone with one hand, although it was not quite as reliable as some others I’ve used, including the physical button on the Apple iPhone SE. Face unlock is excellent, and usually beat me to the fingerprint sensor anyway, plus I like the way it keeps the screen active when you’re looking at it too.The P40 Pro’s standout feature is the camera. The P30 Pro’s camera is a hard act to follow, but the P40 Pro is definitely up to the task. A 50-megapixel, 1/1.28-inch sensor is the headline grabber, followed by a 40-megapixel ultrawide-angle sensor, and a 12-megapixel telephoto camera. Finally, there is a 3D Depth sensor. The telephoto camera enables a 5x optical zoom and a 10x hybrid zoom, and a 50x digital zoom.Extras include optical and artificial intelligence-driven image stabilization, 4K video at 60 fps, and Huawei’s upgraded XD Fusion image signal processor. Plus, Huawei has again worked with Leica to produce the camera on the P40 Pro.The P40 Pro has a mighty zoom ability. Everyone else is simply following in Huawei’s wake here, right up to the maximum 50x digital zoom. The app prompts you to use the 5x and 10x zooms, and there isn’t much difference in quality between shots you take with either. This is a testament to Huawei’s superb A.I. and camera tuning.In reality, this means you can confidently use the 5x and 10x zoom without questioning whether the results will be decent. Huawei’s A.I. then works wonders with 50x zoom. No, you won’t want to share the photos taken at this level of magnification very often, but it’s impossible to deny how good it is, compared to the disastrous shots taken with even moderate zooms just a few years ago. The stabilization at long zoom is excellent, keeping the subject in the viewfinder with only a little movement on-screen.I’m also impressed by the P40 Pro’s bokeh — both artificial bokeh mode in Aperture or Portrait mode, or natural bokeh generated by the large sensor. Using the artificial modes, edge recognition is great, and in normal mode, you can also get close up to small items, such as flowers, and get a strong natural bokeh effect. I’m also happy there is a standalone monochrome mode to give your photos that atmospheric Leica look.What about night mode? A mainstay of Huawei cameras for several years, it’s not the mainstay mode for night shots here, because the standard camera is so incredibly good on its own. You have to experiment with the camera, as sometimes Night mode will take a brighter, more detailed picture, but often just leaving it in normal mode produces startlingly good low-light images.All this is before you dig into the video, where not only can you shoot in wide-angle and zoom, but also 4K resolution at 60 fps, and in slow-motion to 7,860 fps. Stabilization is excellent, the colors are vivid, and there is an extensive video editing mode built into the standard Gallery app.Is there anything bad about the P40 Pro’s camera? Shots taken with different lenses do look different, with exposure, color balance, and atmosphere varying in a scene depending on whether you take the photo with the wide-angle or standard lens. It’s not unique to the Huawei phone though, as this happens on all multi-lens smartphones.I find it hard to fault otherwise, as tiny inconsistencies in dynamics and colors won’t be noticed by most people. It’s the new smartphone camera to beat.You want the camera, right? Of course you do. But to get it, you’ll have to make some compromises.The Huawei P40 Pro does not have Google Mobile Services (GMS) installed, which means no Google Play, Google Pay, Google Maps, or any other Google-backed app or service. Instead, the phone uses Huawei Mobile Services (HMS) and the Huawei App Gallery app store, all built on Android 10 with Huawei’s own EMUI 10.1 user interface over the top.If you’ve used the Mate 30 Pro, the P30 Pro, or earlier phones like the P20 Pro, the software will be familiar territory. Huawei either lets you hide apps in an app drawer, or spread them across multiple home screens. There’s a great dark mode, and a wealth of great Huawei apps in place of Google’s apps. Huawei’s email client and calendar are both excellent, for example, as is Huawei Health’s fitness tracking app.Using the P40 Pro is very fluid, speedy, and simple. Huawei has refined EMUI to the point where it’s close enough to standard Android that it doesn’t require much learning for newcomers, yet it’s still very obviously Huawei’s own overall experience in terms of design. I didn’t come across any of the annoyances I encountered on the Huawei Mate Xs, and found the P40 Pro’s software polished and reliable.However, the App Gallery does not fulfill all my app needs, and it may not fulfill all yours either. I’ve gone into detail about what was missing and why it impacted me when I used the Mate Xs, and the situation is essentially the same on the P40 Pro.There is good news. Maps is now officially available in the App Gallery and is a great alternative to Google Maps, even if you can’t easily import all your saved places from Google’s app. The navigation is effective, although I have not been able to test it out much yet due to movement restrictions. The swipe-in news feed on the home screen has links that don’t just go to sites behind a paywall, increasing its usefulness immensely.By using the Phone Clone app, the Amazon App Store, and some APK files to install the majority of my required apps, the P40 Pro is entirely usable for those who are not deep into Google’s ecosystem. But this is still where the problem lies.I can’t easily access my files on Google Drive, making importing/backing up WhatsApp and Line conversations impossible. I can’t use Google Pay, my Google smart home devices can’t be controlled through an app, and my subscription to YouTube Premium is less enjoyable when I’m forced to use the browser to access the site. Using the browser as a replacement for apps, in general, isn’t the greatest experience, but it’s something you have to get used to on the P40 Pro.I do question some choices made by Huawei’s app ecosystem. Upon opening the app store I’m often greeted by an ad that can’t be skipped for a few seconds, which I find unacceptable. Opening the music or video app takes me directly to the new Huawei content stores, pushing me into the pay areas, rather than immediately to my own stored files. Huawei’s still going through a learning process and is finding its feet, but these actions won’t help to smooth out the transition to the App Gallery and HMS for many.There’s a further problem with the haphazard way of installing apps outside of the App Gallery, and that’s with notifications. Twitter and Instagram, for example, are installed through Amazon’s App Store, and the arrival of notifications is spotty. Then there is updating apps, which isn’t automatic when they come from multiple sources, and I have security concerns when installing apps from unofficial sources. All this makes using the phone more time-consuming and awkward than many will prefer.Bottom line? If you use Google’s services every day or rely on certain apps that aren’t available through the App Gallery, you will encounter some problems changing over to the P40 Pro. If Google isn’t essential to your mobile life, and your apps are readily available from Huawei’s app store, then the P40 Pro will be easier to live with. Huawei is confident the App Gallery will improve in the future, but we can only assess the app situation as it stands today.The software, or more specifically the app store and availability of apps, is the risk in purchasing and using the Huawei P40 Pro daily.Huawei’s own Kirin 990 processor, an octa-core chip based on the ARM Cortex A76 architecture with a separate Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for artificial intelligence duties, is inside the P40 Pro. It also has a built-in 5G modem, rather than a separate modem, for improved reception and efficiency. Due to movement restrictions I have not been able to test the 5G connection on the P40 Pro, but found it was excellent on the Mate Xs. It has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space.There’s a healthy selection of games in the App Gallery, depending on your tastes. Asphalt 9 is available, and plays faultlessly in High Quality display and performance mode. Games can also be downloaded from the Amazon App Store, and although the ones I tried played perfectly, I did find the dual-lens selfie camera interfered with the interface by obscuring buttons on the screen. Benchmark tests downloaded as APK files returned these results:3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 5,303 (Vulkan)Geekbench 5: 755 Single Core/2,993 Multi CoreThese scores are well below the Oppo Find X2 Pro, which has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 inside, and can’t match the Exynos 990-powered Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus either. Because the apps had to be installed outside of an official store, there may have been compatibility issues affecting the scores, as there was no evidence of slowness during my time with the phone.Battery life is great, just like you’d expect from a Huawei P-Series device, and the 4,200mAh cell lasts two days without a problem. It has both fast wired charging, which took an hour and 10 minutes to take the battery from 5% to full, and fast wireless charging too.The Huawei P40 Pro is available to buy in the United Kingdom now through Huawei’s own site and Carphone Warehouse, but has not been officially released in the U.S., but could be sourced as an import. It costs 900 British pounds, which converts to around $1,120. Huawei provides a two-year warranty on its phones in the U.K., covering manufacturing defects.The Huawei P40 Pro has fabulous hardware and a dreamy camera, with a long-lasting battery to ensure you get the most from both. You are going to have to compromise on the software, which through no fault of Huawei’s, does not come with the Google Play Store. This means you may have to find new ways of working and communicating to enjoy what the P40 Pro has to offer.Yes. Let’s start with Huawei’s own alternative, the P40 Pro Plus, which will launch sometime in June or soon after. The camera promises to be even better, as it has a cutting-edge 10x optical zoom among other features, so if you’re happy to embrace the Google-less life, it may be worth waiting to get the very best model in the P40 family to do so.Otherwise, if you’re spending $1,000 to $1,100 your decision should include the $1,000 or 1,000-British pound Apple iPhone 11 Pro, the $1,200 or 1,000-pound Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, the $1,300 or 1,100-pound Oppo Find X2 Pro, or the $900 or 800 British pound OnePlus 8 Pro. All of these phones have excellent cameras and stunning screens, along with better access to all the apps you could want.You could even turn back the clock and find Huawei’s 2019 flagship the P30 Pro, which is still excellent today, costs less, and has Google Mobile Services installed.The P40 Pro has an IP68 water resistance rating, but isn’t an especially durable as it’s made from glass. A case is recommended to keep it safe. The hardware itself will be fresh for years to come, and certainly won’t be lacking in ability. Interestingly, there’s a strong chance the App Gallery — which is the P40 Pro’s biggest downside today — will get better over time too, providing more apps that we want.No. It’s with a heavy heart I say this, because there is a lot to love about the Huawei P40 Pro. However, for the majority of people, access to apps is too restricted at this time."
22,IPhone 12,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-12-review/,"Among the press and technology enthusiasts, the iPhone 12 Pro gets the focus. It’s the high-end model with all of the features, and price be damned, we all want one. But that overlooks the fact that most people have more reasonable expectations and budgets, and are immediately drawn to the standard iPhone 12.The iPhone 12 is the phone that gets people in the door (or on the website), where they then have the option of changing their choice to a Mini, Pro, or Pro Max. And that puts a lot of burden on the iPhone 12: It has to be really good because most people pick it by default. Here’s how well it lives up to the expectations. And why it is, indeed, the best iPhone 12 model for most people.The iPhone 12 is exactly the same size as the 12 Pro — Apple’s own cases are interchangeable. And with a case on the phone, the only way you can tell it’s not a Pro is the missing third camera lens — though you still get the large squircle camera housing, reminding you of the space that would be occupied by more sensors if you had spent more money.But if you’re bold enough to use your phone without a case, or are at least drawn to the idea that you would carry it naked, there are many other differentiators in the hardware. First is the colors, which by now you’ve undoubtedly seen lined up looking like a bowl of Skittles. The iPhone 12’s colors are fun, playful, and bright — even this blue one which, alongside the black, is one of the relatively subdued options.The iPhone 12 stands out with a fresh look and feel, done with a familiar high level of execution.The iPhone 12’s frame is made of aluminum, not stainless steel like the 12 Pro, and that metal is finished in a matte texture to the 12 Pro’s hyper gloss. It takes that gloss to the back glass instead, which is a boon for grip but is an absolute fingerprint smudge magnet — it will never, ever be clean after the moment you take it out of its box.Smudges aside, which are just a reality of modern glass-backed phones, the iPhone 12 is striking. It’s a truly beautiful design, and I’m so happy we’re back to these angular lines from the metal pillow shapes of the last few years. There’s just more for your fingers and eyes to explore, and it’s actually easy to hold. Even more so with the 12, which is about 15% lighter than the 12 Pro, although that lightness contributes to it feeling a little cheap or flimsy. If you’d never held the 11 Pro or 12 Pro you wouldn’t think about it, though — this is just a light and easy-to-manage phone.The lightness is impressive when you remember the screen is bigger than before, now 6.1 inches, thanks to a new OLED display with smaller bezels on all sides. And when you add in the sharp transition from screen glass to metal sides, it feels even more compact. The Face ID notch is still visually bothersome, but Face ID itself is very much worth the trade-off.The display is excellent, particularly for this price. It’s crisp, bright, and colorful with good viewing angles and minimal color shift. And of course, because it’s a laminated OLED, outdoor visibility is good as well.The only difference, at least on paper, is that the iPhone 12 has a quoted max brightness of 625 nits, to the 12 Pro’s 800 nits. The distinction is odd, as teardowns show the displays to be interchangeable, and Apple’s own documentation shows they can both reach the same 1200 nits when viewing HDR content. I can barely tell the 12 Pro’s display is brighter, but I also don’t know if that’s just a mind trick. It certainly doesn’t look like it’s 28% brighter as Apple’s figures claim.The new Ceramic Shield glass promises 4X improved drop performance, which we can all appreciate, but I’ll make it explicitly clear: There’s no claim that it’s better against scratches. My review unit has already picked up a few tiny scratches with normal use over the course of a week — so don’t expect this display to be indestructible. I did manage to clumsily drop the phone on the sidewalk from waist height, thankfully with a silicone case on, and there were no ill effects.For a lot of people, the best part about the iPhone 12 will be that it has the exact same iOS 14 software experience as their current phone. While that may seem boring to Android users who ostensibly have the opportunity to try a new flavor of Android with each phone upgrade, that consistency is a big reason why so many people stick with iPhones.Depending on how old your current iPhone is, the only difference with the 12 is that everything will just happen faster — and it’ll continue to be fast for years to come. The A14 Bionic chip is faster than whatever you’re using now and is clearly designed to handle future iOS features.The only differences in daily use between the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro can be found when you really push the phones. The iPhone 12 has 4GB of RAM (memory) to the 12 Pro’s 6GB, which means if you’re doing heavy multitasking, or playing an intense game while streaming media in the background, you may see a small difference in performance. And we know that the lesser memory amount is the reason why a few of the most advanced camera processing features are limited to the 12 Pro.But in all of my regular use, which isn’t that heavy, I noticed no difference in app open times, graphics, or anything like that. Ultimately the A14 Bionic is still running the show, and that’s what matters. Nobody can accuse the iPhone 12 of being slow.Even with less memory than the 12 Pro, the iPhone 12 still flies in everyday tasks.There’s no reason for me to repeat myself in talking about 5G and MagSafe, the two big features of the iPhone 12 generation, after spilling hundreds of words on both in my iPhone 12 Pro review. I hope you’ll read the details there, because they’re fully transferrable to a discussion about the iPhone 12 too. But, a quick recap is in order.The core of the 5G technology discussion is this: Right now, you’ll mostly be using Sub-6 5G, which acts like super-charged 4G. It’s a little faster, and more consistently fast without using more power, than what you’re used to now — that’s great, but not game-changing. The so-called mmWave 5G, which is in use primarily by Verizon but growing with T-Mobile and AT&T, is the dramatically faster, but incredibly sparse, network that is still years away from being ubiquitous. There’s no reason to buy the iPhone 12 for 5G, but it sure will be nice to have in the years to come.MagSafe is exciting, particularly because we know Apple has a good track record of getting these sorts of ecosystems right (most of the time) and will get the critical mass of supported phones and accessories soon enough. But right now, there isn’t much to say. Apple makes a charger, which is nice but not appreciably different from the way you use most wireless chargers. And its cases — of which there are two available — are simply pass-throughs for other MagSafe accessories. We need to see a robust market of third-party MagSafe accessories before we can judge the success of this system — that may take a while.After spending a week with the iPhone 12 Pro for review, exploring all of the new features and doing plenty of 5G speed tests, I was able to settle right into the iPhone 12 and use it even more normally, as I would later on in its life after the review rush is over. That gives my evaluation of the 12’s battery a better “real-world use” analysis.And it turns out when you stop testing the iPhone 12 and just use it, battery life is really good! Yes, the capacity is the same as the 12 Pro, which is actually lower than the iPhone 11 Pro, but Apple knows what it’s doing here with a much more efficient chipset running the phone.You will easily get through a full day with plenty of battery to spare.In my normal use, which includes a majority of my time on Wi-Fi and primarily keeping up with lots of emails, messages, social media apps, utilities, and lots of podcast listening over Bluetooth, I easily get through a day with 30% remaining. That means I have plenty of overhead for those heavier days with lots of photos and video, streaming YouTube or fresh podcast episodes, hotspotting over 5G, or taking video calls. Even with all of that, I’d typically only hit Low Power Mode (20%) at dinnertime — and make it to bed without charging.Chances are that if you’ve gone with the iPhone 12 and not the 12 Pro, your expected use will be a bit lighter to begin with. And it doesn’t even matter: Using the 12 and 12 Pro the same way, battery life wasn’t an issue on either phone. The iPhone 12 Pro Max will obviously be the real battery champion, for people who need to push the limits of their phone every single day.The primary draw for people to buy the 12 Pro compared to the 12 is its camera improvements. But it’s important to note that the 12 offers most of the 12 Pro’s camera experience. The 12 pro offers a “telephoto” camera, a lidar sensor, Dolby Vision HDR video at 60 fps (up from 30), and the promise of Apple ProRAW file support in the future.The camera is identical to the 12 Pro where it counts: The main camera and image processing.That telephoto camera is only a 2X zoom past the main camera, which isn’t critical to have. Lidar brings Portrait Mode to Night Mode, which is cool but not necessary; remember, regular Night Mode is otherwise identical on both phones. And chances are that if you care about shooting HDR at 60 fps, you just bought an iPhone 12 Pro.The main, ultra-wide, and selfie cameras are all identical hardware, backed up by the same camera processing including Smart HDR 3, Deep Fusion, and every other Apple buzzword. All that is to say, most people wouldn’t notice a difference in the camera capabilities between the 12 and 12 Pro — which is great for iPhone 12 buyers.As I’ve mentioned many times, more camera thoughts (and lots of sample photos) can be found in my iPhone 12 Pro review.Camera performance is fantastic by the measure of a $999 iPhone 12 Pro, meaning it’s particularly great for $200 less here. The main camera consistently produces bright, crisp, and colorful photos with a bit of a warm and punchy profile that’s pleasing but not overblown. HDR effects don’t go crazy, and typically do a fine job of managing to bring down highlights and up lowlights. Portrait Mode continues to be great for proper chest-up portraits, but more hit-or-miss for full-body shots or inanimate objects.At night, you immediately see the benefits of the wider aperture and enhanced night mode processing. Photos go toe-to-toe with the Pixel 5’s Night Sight, but the iPhone 12 has the benefit of not having to switch to a separate mode for these photos — the camera decides when to do it. And despite not having lidar, I didn’t have issues with autofocus in the dark.It’s dead simple to take excellent photos in most scenarios. And yes, Dolby Vision is cool too.Again as I discussed in my iPhone 12 Pro review, the draw of Dolby Vision HDR is interesting but not practical at this point. DV HDR can only be viewed on modern iPhones, Macs, and Apple TVs hooked up to compatible TVs. Anywhere else you view or share it, like social media platforms, you’ll see standard dynamic range. And you’ll be saving huge files in the process: A one-minute 4K 30 HDR clip is about 250MB. Thankfully Apple’s typical 4K 60 fps video looks great even in SDR, with good stabilization for shooting handheld.Those who have an iPhone already and are eyeballing an upgrade to the latest phones should start with the iPhone 12 as their default choice. It’s a great phone that brings all of Apple’s usual strengths: Great hardware, a nice display, consistent performance, and now a particularly great camera. It also has good battery life, 5G connectivity for the future, and intriguing additions like MagSafe. It’s a fantastic overall phone, for a reasonable price.Only consider moving up to the iPhone 12 Pro if you know that you need what it offers. I recommend paying $50 extra for 128GB of storage on the iPhone 12, meaning the 12 Pro is $150 more. For that money, you get a heavier stainless steel body in new colors, an extra camera with a few extra camera features, and more memory for potential improvements in performance down the road. Most people simply won’t care enough to make that money worth it and will be better off spending that $150 on a couple of cases and MagSafe accessories.This price bracket is a competitive one, with multiple Android competitors available for those who are willing to move beyond the Apple world. The Google Pixel 5 offers a similar simplistic approach like the iPhone, with a comparable camera and slick software, for $100 less. The OnePlus 8T is the same price, with better hardware but weaker cameras. And the Galaxy S20 FE provides a bit of an Apple antidote with a bigger screen, more cameras, more flash, and more features.Obviously, most people are going to stay put in the iPhone ecosystem, so there’s really only one other choice: Spend $200 more for an iPhone 12 Pro. Or, if you’re being pragmatic and buy a 128GB storage model, it’s just a $150 upgrade. For that money, you get a heavier stainless steel frame, additional telephoto camera, lidar sensor for advanced camera features, and a subtle upgrade in memory. It’s not going to blow away most people who would likely be content with an iPhone 12 to begin with, but it is a viable choice if money isn’t much of an object.With Apple’s superb track record of updating iPhones with fresh software for several years after release, and a powerful A14 Bionic processor, there’s no doubt the iPhone 12 will confidently last you for three years without much thought. The aluminum frame technically isn’t as strong as the 12 Pro’s steel, but then again most other phones are aluminum as well.There are also some concerns that the Ceramic Shield glass may be quite scratch-prone despite being very strong against cracking — but we simply cannot know the long-term viability of Ceramic Shield until it has been in the wild for years.Absolutely. If you’re in the iPhone ecosystem, the iPhone 12 is an excellent all-around phone offering great value for the money."
23,IPhone 12 Pro,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-12-pro-review/,"Apple’s phone lineup has steadily grown in size, and therefore complexity. For the end of 2020, we have four iPhone 12 models spanning three sizes and several hundred dollars, in addition to the iPhone SE, iPhone XR, and iPhone 11 that are still on sale. Apple will sell you a new iPhone to fit just about any possible need, whether it be size, features, and budget.But in the eyes of many people, there’s really only one choice: The latest Pro model. The iPhone 12 Pro has less to differentiate itself from the “standard” model than last year’s Pro, yet still commands a $200 premium. Is it still the one to get? Let’s discuss.I also urge you to read our complete and comprehensive review of the iPhone 12, if the Pro model isn’t quite your thing (or your budget).After three years of the same rounded-off design, we have something fresh to lay our eyes and hands on. The iPhone 12 series has a delightfully angular, slab-like look. For the 12 Pro, an upgraded stainless steel frame that’s unapologetically heavier than the aluminum 12 is done up beautifully with an intense gloss and a flat glass back that retains the etched matte texture of the 11 Pro.The “Pacific Blue” color doesn’t pop nearly as much as the iPhone 12’s candy-like blue, but befits the Pro line’s overall subtle vibe. The hyper-glossy sides are luxurious, no doubt, but amass fingerprints at an incredible rate — on the upside, they provide some grip to counteract the slippery back. The 12 Pro may not be as ergonomically pleasing in the hand as the 11 Pro, but the glossy sides and sharp edges do provide plenty of grip if you’re inclined to use it sans case.It’s refreshing to see an all-new iPhone design, and the Pro finishes take it to a new level.As an overall object to feast your eyes on, it’s as gorgeous as you’d expect from an Apple product. Lines, tolerances, and overall execution are perfect. This design is marred by one flaw, though: A “window” cut into the lower-right side to make way for a mmWave antenna — something exclusive to the U.S. model, and also something you can never really unsee after you notice it.Apple has once again knocked it out of the park, with a new OLED now bumped up to 6.1-inches (from 5.8) diagonally and running at a solid 460 pixels per inch. It’s fantastically calibrated, balancing delightful colors with accuracy, and the subtle True Tone adjustments made to match ambient lighting conditions are the cherry on top. The display also has smaller bezels on all sides, which seem even smaller still thanks to the sharp vertical sides that have replaced the prior subtle curves. So even though the 12 Pro is a tad larger than the 11 Pro, it really doesn’t feel like it. You still have a large notch at the top, which my eyes never quite forget about, but Face ID is so fantastic that I can forgive it.Apple has once again knocked it out of the park with this new display.It’s notable that the 12 Pro sticks with a 60Hz refresh rate — every other phone over $700 has 90Hz or 120Hz. However, iOS is so smooth and well-managed that it isn’t a massive loss, but your eyes definitely notice the drop-off after using another phone. It’s just a quality-of-life improvement that you know you could have elsewhere. We look at our screens for hours a day, so I think we deserve a high refresh rate.The screen doesn’t get as crazy-nuclear bright as the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, but the viewing angles and reflectivity are so great you’ll never have an issue seeing the screen outdoors. You’ll see a brightness of “1,200 nits” thrown around in reference to this display, but that’s a bit of a misnomer. It can reach 1,200 nits when viewing HDR photos or videos, which is cool, but not something you do regularly. The important number is 800 nits, which is the typical full-screen brightness. That’s still very bright, and one place where the display beats the cheaper iPhone 12, which tops out at 600 nits (but interestingly, still does 1,200 nits for HDR).Outside of the considerable changes you can see in the hardware, there’s a big one that you can’t: New “Ceramic Shield” glass over the display. It looks and feels identical to any other smartphone, but Apple claims it has four times better drop durability — which I of course didn’t go out of my way to test. But given how many phones we all see in use with shattered screens, and how many pop-up screen repair shops there are, this is obviously a needed improvement.Notably, the back is still made of the more common ion-exchange glass, and is still likely to crack at roughly the same rate as every other glass-backed phone. Apple also doesn’t claim that Ceramic Shield is less scratch-prone than any other glass, which is just part of the deal — there’s an inherent trade-off between scratch resistance and crack resistance. This is something we all have to deal with over time — though for the paranoid, screen protectors exist.Apple has cultivated an exceptional holistic experience combining hardware and software, the core of which doesn’t really change from generation to generation. That’s true primarily because iOS 14 is available back to the iPhone 6S, so just about anyone upgrading from an old iPhone will have zero surprises awaiting on the 12 Pro. There’s no need to give a full recap of the ways iOS is a great operating system, particularly since so few people are actually switching between Android and iOS at this point.The iPhone 12 Pro simply augments and enhances the iPhone experience you already know. With the A14 Bionic chip running the show, the 12 Pro does everything at a blistering pace — there’s nothing you can do to slow it down. Gaming, multitasking, shooting photos and videos, and going through every app you can imagine is slick and carefree. It’s been revealed that it also comes with 6GB of RAM, versus 4GB in the iPhone 12, which helps boost performance and give it even more runway to handle iOS updates for years to come.An entirely new iPhone experience is MagSafe — an old name with a new purpose. A ring of magnets in the back of the phone enables you to connect standardized accessories, which can come in just about any form. Apple has a $39 MagSafe charger, which provides 15 watts of power (more than a standard wireless charger) and is actually quite convenient because you know with 100% certainty that it’s charging when it connects. It also happens to be great for gaming with the phone in landscape.MagSafe has promise, but you shouldn’t expect it to change your life on Day 1.But the real promise of the MagSafe experience has yet to be realized. Apple’s first-party (read: expensive) cases all support MagSafe, in that they have magnets that are guaranteed to work with other attachments, but nothing about these cases requires the magnets. And provided you’re using a thin case, it doesn’t need to have magnets in it to work with the MagSafe charger. But you can bet a vast majority of iPhone 12 cases will have the magnets anyway.Any accessory company can make MagSafe products, so we’re seeing some amazing ideas thrown around — from multidevice desk chargers, to car mounts, to modular mounting systems for bikes and tripods. And these are all particularly exciting if you’re not one to use a case usually, as you no longer have to put on one company’s case for that company’s accessories to work — your phone is fully compatible all on its own.It would be nearly impossible to be aware of the iPhone 12 and not know that it has 5G. Apple and every carrier in the world have been emphasizing it. But does it actually matter? Well, a whole lot like the discussion of MagSafe, 5G is filled with potential for the future and unfulfilled promises in the present.iPhone 12 and 5G: How it will (eventually) make a differenceFirst and foremost, your 5G experience will depend on your carrier and where you live. (Beware: Nerdy talk ahead.) T-Mobile has the largest 5G network footprint, because it’s based on the wide-reaching and easily-deployable Sub-6 standard that relies on low-band spectrum. AT&T is in a close second as it’s also primarily based on Sub-6.Verizon, on the other hand, just turned on its Sub-6 network, using a limited amount of spectrum, after spending years plowing money into its high-band mmWave (millimeter-wave) 5G network. While mmWave is incredibly fast, leading to absurd 4-plus Gbps potential downloads, it’s also incredibly unreliable (right now) because it has an absurdly short range. We’re talking about losing a signal by walking a few steps, turning around, or having a dense tree blow in the wind. T-Mobile and AT&T also have mmWave networks with tiny footprints, but it’s not the core of their 5G network.There is no reason to buy a 5G phone for mmWave. It’s only available in tiny parts of a handful of cities nationwide. It’s simply a bonus the couple of times you’ll see it.On the other hand, Sub-6 5G is basically like supercharged 4G: Widespread coverage, faster speeds, no impact on battery life, and seamless transition down to 4G. Using Sub-6 on T-Mobile in New York City, I routinely had download speeds in the 100 Mbps to 300 Mbps range, and uploads in the 25 Mbps to 75 Mbps range. Not mind-blowing, particularly when ping times (30ms to 50 ms) often matched 4G, but it’s just faster and works exactly as you’re used to.5G isn’t game-changing yet, but you can see a notable and consistent improvement in everyday speeds.Knowing that 5G networks still aren’t fully developed, Apple has a set of smart controls in the software to mitigate the impact of transitions between networks. By default voice and data are set to “5G Auto,” which prioritizes having the best overall network experience; you can set it to “5G On” to stick to 5G as often as possible. You can also set your data mode to “Allow More Data on 5G” from “Standard,” which lets the phone use 5G whole cloth for everything possible, maximizing video quality when streaming or doing video chats.Apple’s default choices here are the right ones, and most people shouldn’t touch these settings. Between the phone and carrier, network usage is pretty well handled to give you the best combination of speed and battery usage. I stuck to the defaults and saw 5G nearly 100% of the time, aside from trips in the subway and inside some buildings.When Apple unveils its phones, it always quotes a very ambiguous battery life number like “17 hours of video playback on Wi-Fi,” which isn’t useful in the slightest. But it was telling this time around that Apple made no claims of increased battery life. And now we know why: The iPhone 12 Pro’s battery is actually smaller than the 11 Pro’s. But capacity has never been of much consequence for the iPhone, because the chipset and operating system work together to squeeze the most out of it.That is, once again, the case. The A14 Bionic is clearly an exceptional piece of silicon, working perfectly hand in hand with iOS 14. Using the 12 Pro like I had been using my 11 Pro for months prior, battery life was generally great. An entire day of casual use with emails, social apps, messaging, taking photos, using Maps, and copious amounts of Pocket Casts, I would use 3 to 4 hours of “screen on” time and still have 20% to 30% of my battery left at the end of the day.The battery still dramatically outperforms its capacity, even though it doesn’t offer the same confidence as the 11 Pro.The one caveat here is when you’re hitting the phone hard, particularly with networking. It turns out when you have a 5G connection providing 200-plus Mbps, you use it a lot! When you’re streaming video, it’s super-high-quality video. When you can download and upload large files in a moment, you do it now rather than waiting to get home. And if you’re running your hot spot, you can use your laptop as if it were on excellent home Wi-Fi — and that takes a whole lot of battery power.So with 20% to 30% of leeway, those heavy days took me down into Low Power Mode to get through the evening — but I still made it regardless. I certainly have a feeling that there’s less wiggle room in the 12 Pro’s battery than in my 11 Pro’s, but it’s not concerning.The one caveat here is if you’re regularly using a mmWave 5G network, which consistently draws more power right now because your phone is almost constantly switching to and from the network for data transfers, and constantly looking for new towers. That’s an issue for Verizon customers primarily, and less so for AT&T and T-Mobile, but it’s something to consider. It’s also something that’s a “right now” problem as mmWave is still struggling to build up to a considerable footprint.I also have to commend Apple for its battery-saving charging program, which by default slows down the charging rate after 80% charge to minimize the time the phone spends at 100%. It’s bad for batteries to spend lots of time at 0%, or 100% on a charger, and tons of smartphones implement these safeguards to increase battery longevity. Apple’s version is seamless.The iPhone 12 Pro takes a familiar 12-megapixel sensor and pairs it with a new lens that has a wider f/1.6 aperture, leading to a claimed 27% improvement in low-light performance. The physics are a known quantity: A wider aperture lets in more light to the sensor, and requires shorter shutter speeds and lower ISOs. That means sharper, smoother photos in all lighting conditions.I’m starting out by focusing on low-light photos because there’s an improvement this year that’s clearly visible. Low-light photos on the 12 Pro are consistently smoother, less grainy, and yet sharper than before. Apple’s multi-frame and “Deep Fusion” processing, leaning on the A14 Bionic’s “neural engine,” layers frames to produce incredible shots that have good detail, and proper colors and white balance as well. You can also now use Night Mode on the ultrawide camera, which yields far weaker results compared to the main camera, but is dramatically better than last year without it.Night photos see the biggest improvements, and the results are incredible.I’m not going to outright say that the 12 Pro’s Night Mode shots are better than the Google Pixel 5’s Night Sight. But it’s neck and neck in most situations, and an extra point goes to Apple’s camera app for having a smooth transition between modes. You don’t need to switch to Night Mode like you do Night Sight — it just happens automatically.Photos in good lighting are more of the same. Apple has an incredibly consistent, solid, and relatively neutral approach to camera processing. Colors pop, but not too much. Exposure is consistently nailed perfectly. Highlights and lowlights are rarely blown out, yet you don’t get that faux-HDR overprocessed look. All around, it’s hard to take a bad photo with the iPhone 12 Pro — and easy to take a great one.The 12 Pro’s LiDAR camera, which is primarily used for low-light autofocus, also enables better depth mapping for portrait mode effects. Portrait mode continues to be a love-hate feature for me, because when the camera nails it, it’s mind-blowing, but when it misses, it ruins a photo. There are still instances where portrait mode makes your subject look like a cardboard cutout placed in front of a background, and in many cases, there are hilarious mix-ups where it’ll defocus an ear, arm, or piece of clothing. Portrait mode still works best for an actual portrait — aka, from the shoulders on up — where it has far fewer potential points of failure.The lidar camera also enables night portrait mode shots, making the feature exclusive to the 12 Pro and Pro Max. So long as you can get your subject to sit still, the results are surprisingly good. There’s actually less opportunity for processing foul-ups, since the shot comes out softer and smoother overall, though it’s far less likely to come out sharp where it counts — that just comes with the territory.Daylight shots are consistently great, and portrait mode is inching closer to being perfect.I’ll spare you from seeing a gallery of selfies, but Apple hasn’t improved the front camera hardware from the 11 Pro. There’s better processing, including Deep Fusion and “Smart HDR 3,” as well as Night Mode. I found the photos to be the same — aka, very good — as before. Night Mode added little to the experience, as it was far too hard to stay still and hold your arm out steadily enough to get a sharp shot.Secondary to the still photo improvements is Dolby Vision HDR video recording, which is Apple’s other massive marketing push alongside 5G. Dolby Vision is really cool, in that it simply makes your video look incredible — better highlights and lowlights, better peak brightness, everything. Unfortunately, you can only view Dolby vision on a late-model iPhone, MacBook, or Apple TV plugged into a compatible TV. Otherwise, everywhere you export your video, you’re getting a converted SDR video.Dolby Vision could be viewed in many more places in the future, and for that reason, I’d recommend just keeping it turned on in the settings. But otherwise, just expect the standard iPhone video experience: It’s great-looking video that’s incredibly stable even handheld and walking, and even when you stick to the default 1080p resolution (which you can see above). Bump up to 4K 30 frames per second for even better results, though file sizes triple in the process. Thankfully, the iPhone 12 Pro has a base of 128GB of storage.Dolby Vision is an amazing tech demo, but one that has many caveats. Thankfully, SDR video is still great.The only real downside is that you know, despite being a “Pro” model, it’s not the best camera Apple makes. That would be found in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which has a larger main sensor with a new optical image stabilization (OIS) system, as well as a different telephoto lens with a longer focal length. The 12 Pro also only has small benefits over the base 12, with a (frankly weak) telephoto camera and lidar sensor — the core camera experience is otherwise identical. Together, it takes some of the luster off the “Pro” feel of the 12 Pro when you know it’s not much different from the 12, and the 12 Pro Max has the real Pro camera.The iPhone 12 Pro has a smaller addressable market this year, as it feels pressure from multiple angles. It represents a relatively small year-over-year upgrade from the 11 Pro, is only marginally more interesting than the base iPhone 12 that’s a full $200 less, and doesn’t have the same “Pro” camera as the larger iPhone 12 Pro Max.There’s no reason to talk about how much value 5G, MagSafe, Dolby Vision, and general camera improvements add to the experience, because they can all be found on the base iPhone 12. For most people, the iPhone 12 Pro is excessive — it’s more money for marginal benefit. But it is better, and sometimes that’s all you need to know to go Pro.There’s still reason to desire the iPhone 12 Pro. The stainless steel frame gives you a reassuring heft and feeling of quality, and the finish and colors are arguably nicer than those of the base 12. The telephoto camera and lidar sensor are just icing on the cake that is an exceptional camera experience overall. Battery life is good, the screen is fantastic, and the A14 Bionic paired with ample memory and 128GB of base storage is giving you years of runway to keep this phone for a long time.I’ll recommend that most undecided iPhone buyers choose the iPhone 12 instead, because it’s so similar and costs less. But if you know from the outset that you’re a Pro user, there’s no reason to convince you otherwise: The iPhone 12 Pro is the phone for you.The clear alternative to the iPhone 12 Pro is the base iPhone 12. It’s $200 less, yet offers a nearly identical day-to-day experience. They are the exact same size, run the same software, have the same battery, and offer the same core features. The 12 Pro simply adds more memory, more base storage, and a telephoto camera and lidar sensor, and looks distinctly different, with new colors and a steel frame. Most people should start their iPhone search with the 12, and only choose the 12 Pro if they know they need the heightened set of features.On the Android side, there’s a big argument for also saving money and getting the Pixel 5 for just $700. It follows the simple “less is more” vibe of the iPhone the best out of any Android device, and has a comparable camera. There’s also the OnePlus 8T, which offers a similar experience at the same price, but with a bit more flair. On the top end, a Galaxy S20+ can be found for roughly the same price as the iPhone 12 Pro, and measures up in terms of hardware quality and features. It also comes from the only brand that really challenges Apple for recognition.It’s well-known that iPhones have gloriously long life spans, thanks to software update support that lasts several years. With the A14 Bionic chip, 5G networking, and a top-end display, you’ll have no problem getting three years out of the iPhone 12 Pro before feeling like it’s a little behind the times. The only questions will be how the Ceramic Shield display glass holds up, and whether you find the battery degrades gracefully over time.Yes. The iPhone 12 Pro is the perfect embodiment of Apple’s excellent smartphone experience, with no corners cut or specs left out for cost savings."
24,LG V60 ThinQ,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-lg-phones/,"LG has developed a solid reputation for developing some very interesting and attractive Android smartphones, even if it isn’t one of the big boys in the space right now. Whether you’re looking for novel dual-screen devices or dependable all-rounders, LG almost certainly has you covered, and its phones are generally priced more competitively than much of the competition. That said, if you’re new to the LG stable, you may not be sure which is the best model for you, not least when LG’s phones sport confusingly similar names (LG V60 ThinQ versus G8X ThinQ, anyone?).Luckily, this guide offers a rundown of the best LG phones available to buy right now. It features the best LG smartphone overall, and it also covers the best LG phones for particular needs and tastes. This should help you get past all of those confusing code names.Why you should buy this: It’s a beautifully-designed smartphone with a sharp screen, strong battery life, 5G support, and military-standard durability.Who it’s for: Anybody looking for the latest and best LG flagship smartphone and who prizes beautiful looks and long-lasting batteries.Why we picked the LG Velvet: First things first: The LG Velvet looks absolutely stunning, even when compared to beauties from other leading manufacturers like Samsung. It comes in either Aurora Green or Illusion Sunset (a bit like Samsung’s variably bluish Aura Glow color), both of which look exceedingly sleek and alluring. On the front, it boasts an edge-to-edge display with a tidy punch-hole selfie camera at the top, while the rear benefits from a striking teardrop array for its triple-lens camera. It’s also invitingly thin, and its curved edges make the 7.9mm profile seem even thinner in your hands.Its display is also very nice, featuring a big 6.8-inch P-OLED screen with a resolution of 2460 x 1080 pixels. It’s not quite as sharp as the screen you can find in other leading flagships, but it does the job nicely, with its larger dimensions feeling satisfyingly impressive.Its two other big draws are its 4,300mAh battery and durability. The battery will see you into a second day under most usage regimes, while its IP68 and MIL-STD 810G ratings suggest that it can withstand a fair amount of punishment. There’s also the option to buy a separate dual-screen case, so you can operate two touchscreens at once (great for multitasking).In other departments, the LG Velvet is more or less average at best. Its camera takes great ultrawide shots, although the quality of its main lens is occasionally inconsistent, either over- or under-sharpening shots and requiring post-photo editing. Similarly, it uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, which will handle most everyday tasks pretty well but won’t offer the same high-level performance as other flagships.These qualifications aside, the LG Velvet is a very good Android smartphone overall. It’s almost certainly the best smartphone LG has produced to date, and hopefully, it’s something LG can build on in the future.Read more in our full LG Velvet reviewTo put it as reductively as possible, the LG V60 ThinQ is basically a version of the LG Velvet that doesn’t look quite as good, but that still offers pretty much the same performance and the same features. It supports 5G, has a very beefy Snapdragon 865 chip and a highly-enduring 5,000mAh battery, and you can use it with a dual-screen case (purchased separately). It’s almost a great phone, save for an inconsistent camera that struggles in low light and some software niggles (such as bloatware and intrusive reminders). Still, if you can find it for less than the LG Velvet, it may be preferable to the newer model.Read more in our full LG V60 ThinQ reviewWhy you should buy this: You get another great all-round LG smartphone, but with a dual-screen case bundled in for good measureWho it’s for: Anybody who wants to multitask on a high-powered and reliable flagship smartphone.Why we picked the LG G8X ThinQ: While a number of recent LG flagships are compatible with dual-screen cases, only the G8X ThinQ comes with such a case as standard. This makes it the LG of choice for anyone who likes to multitask on their phone or who uses their device for work. The case slots easily onto the phone using a USB Type-C connection, providing a second 6.4-inch OLED display with 2340 x 1080 pixels, just like the G8X ThinQ’s main screen. You can use both screens separately to look at two different apps at the same time, or you can use them in combination as a kind of super-screen. They’re particularly useful for gamers, and the LG Gamepad feature lets you use a virtual video game controller on the bottom screen.Besides the usefulness of the extra screen, the G8X ThinQ flaunts a number of other desirable features. It runs on a Snapdragon 855 chip and uses 6GB of RAM, making it fairly agile as a computing device, although its own software can be a touch sluggish at times. Its 4,000mAh battery is also generous enough when it comes to keeping you going until the next day, although if you use the dual-screen case regularly, you’ll most likely find that you need to charge before bedtime.Also, as with other recent LG phones, the audio experience offered by the LG G8X ThinQ is surprisingly excellent, surpassing even that offered by iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices. Support for hi-res files and Hi-Fi Quad DAC (which processes the audio signal four times in parallel) means noise is kept to a minimum, so you can simply enjoy your favorite music or the soundtrack of whatever movie you’re watching.The G8X ThinQ was released in late 2019 for only $700, so you’ll almost certainly find it online for noticeably less at the moment. Its lack of a face unlock feature — and its occasionally unresponsive fingerprint sensor — is a minor negative, but it doesn’t take away from what is a well-priced and feature-rich Android.Read more in our full LG G8X ThinQ reviewWhy you should buy this: It’s a fantastic midrange phone with a captivating display, versatile camera, and solid battery life.Who it’s for: Anybody who wants high power at a discount, particularly if they’re prepared to shop around for the best price.Why we picked the LG G7 ThinQ: When it was launched in 2018, the LG G7 ThinQ certainly wasn’t pitched as a “budget” smartphone. However, now that it’s over two years old, you can find it for very affordable prices online, and it’s still more than worth a look.It houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and comes with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, meaning that it can still outperform certain Android phones released today. The phone also features a 6.1-inch IPS LCD screen with a 3120 x 1440 pixel resolution, making for an impressively sharp 564 pixels per inch. It supports HDR10, so together with the high resolution, the screen displays pleasingly rich colors and contrasts. All in all, it certainly won’t look out of place if you take it to a party with your Apple- and Samsung-owning friends.With a second, ultrawide lens, the G7’s camera is highly versatile. You can take 107-degree panorama shots with this lens, while the standard 16-megapixel lens captures pictures with a satisfying level of detail while also providing a useful portrait mode. It may not be as high-powered as recent flagships, but compared to other LG devices, it’s one of the best camera phones of the bunch.The battery is also dependable — even though it advertises only a 3,000mAh capacity, it will comfortably last a full day of heavy use. Combined with the excellent audio quality we also find on other recent LGs, this makes the G7 ThinQ a great budget Android if you can find it at a discounted price. It may not include 5G support, but with 5G still being somewhat underused, you probably won’t notice.Read more in our full LG G7 ThinQ reviewWhy you should buy this: If you want to impress your friends with your taste in innovative and unusual smartphones, then the LG Wing is the rotating dual-screen smartphone for you.Who it’s for: Buyers who think single-screen smartphones are just a little too passé.Why we picked the LG Wing:In a world where we’ve now seen foldable phones and dual-screen cases, the LG Wing is still capable of turning more than a few heads. It’s also capable of turning itself, with its main 6.8-inch P-OLED screen able to swivel to a horizontal position to reveal a second, 3.9-inch screen underneath. Once in this position, the smartphone assumes a T-shaped outline where you can watch a video or take landscape pictures.To be brutally honest, the LG Wing’s software doesn’t let you do much else beyond this, but it’s an interesting idea nonetheless, and the phone really does look great. More importantly, the idea has been well-executed, with the swivel screen having been tested to 200,000 rotations, meaning it should outlast the length of time you’re likely to use it. It also feels satisfying and effortless to turn and turn back.Basically, you can use the swivel feature to use various controls on the smaller screen while watching videos in landscape, while a number of video games have been adapted for the Wing (such as Asphalt 9 Legends). That said, other app integrations leave much to be desired, with Twitter (for example) not displaying anything on the lower screen while watching embedded videos in landscape.These quibbles aside, the LG Wing is a solid phone in its own right. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 765G, which means it supports 5G. It also carries 8GB of RAM, so it’s more than capable of coping with most of the latest games and apps. Its camera is also pretty good, with a dual-lens setup in normal mode and a third lens that opens up when you swivel the main screen. The camera also incorporates a very effective gimbal system, which digitally stabilizes shots when you have the phone swiveled open.Finally, the phone houses a 4,000mAh battery, which generally ends a single day with nearly a third of its juice left. Combined with a crisp display that boasts a resolution of 2460 x 1080 pixels, it’s a good phone overall, even if its headline feature ends up being underused.Read more in our full LG Wing reviewWhy should you pay attention to our recommendations?

25,LG Velvet,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-velvet-review/,"Someone has woken up at LG, looked at its smartphone output over the past couple of years, and said, “No, that’s all wrong. Let’s start again.”The result is the LG Velvet, the most interesting smartphone to come from LG in ages. Gone is the baffling ThinQ branding. The legacy of the G-and-the-V-series has been consigned to the history books. Finally, LG’s designers haven’t simply looked at the last phone they penned and thought, “Whatever. We’ll just do the same again.”Instead, the Velvet has an intriguing new design to go with its new, memorable name. But even if you remember the name, will you want to buy one?Compared to recent LG phones, the LG Velvet is wonderfully thin. But how does it stack up next to other phones vying for your attention? It still holds its own. It’s sleek, light, stylish, colorful, and packed with interesting flourishes that make it unique.Hyperbole? No. The LG Velvet is 7.9mm thick, but due to LG’s curved “3D Arc Design” concept, it feels even slimmer than that in your hand. The edges taper down sharply, and the overall shape of the body is reminiscent of the OnePlus 8 Pro. It weighs only 180 grams. In these days of phones tipping the scales regularly at over 200 and even 220 grams, the Velvet is positively feather-like.My review model came in Aurora Green, which looks excellent. It reminds me of Bentley’s Verdant Green, and when you get it in the sun, it shimmers and shines. There are several other equally pretty colors, including Illusion Sunset, which looks a little like Samsung’s Aura Glow.Yes, we’ve been seeing great colors on phones for several years, but not on an LG phone. Welcome to 2020, LG, it’s lovely to have you.The camera array is special, too. Arranged in a raindrop formation which gets smaller as the lenses go down, the two lower lenses and the flash are flush with the body. The main top lens does stand slightly proud, but not by much. While it would have been nice if it was also flush, it’s not unattractive. I especially like that the inner lens surround is the same green color as the body.LG put the volume buttons and dedicated Google Assistant key on the opposite side of the body from the power button. For a right-handed person, it’s not the best, ergonomically. The Google Assistant button is set tightly against the body of the phone, and I’ve never pressed it by accident. I also never pressed it intentionally, making me question why it’s there at all.The Velvet’s downside is its sharp edges. Sharp-edged phones all have the same issue; they aren’t comfortable to hold. The Velvet is no exception. Gripping it tightly isn’t pleasant. Aside from that, however, the phone’s design is a win. It’s light, stylish, and modern.The LG Velvet is tall and slim due to its 20.5:9 aspect ratio, P-OLED screen, which measures 6.8-inches and has 2,460 x 1,080-pixel resolution. This brings it close to the 21:9 aspect ratio Motorola adopted for the Edge Plus. Despite the curved edges, the screen does not cascade over the sides, and there is a substantial bezel above, below, and down either side of the phone.Although LG doesn’t mention it in the press materials, the Velvet has HDR10 support and happily plays HDR content from YouTube. I like the central teardrop selfie camera cutout. As we see more oversize pill-shaped double selfie cams on high-end phones, this is a neat and inconspicuous alternative.The audio comes from stereo speakers which sound great. My go-to video test channel is Carfection, and the Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye review demonstrates the best of the LG Velvet. The gruff sound of the Hellcat Redeye’s V8 and the wild whine of the supercharger are as important as the colorful visuals, all shot in the burning sunshine. The Velvet handles both sides well, providing a visual and aural treat.There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom, but sadly, the superb Quad DAC seen on many older LG phones has not arrived with it. It’s such a shame, as without it, the Velvet simply sounds ordinary with wired headphones. Connect headphones with Bluetooth, though, and you can get AptX HD, provided they support the higher resolution codec.Downsides? The screen doesn’t have a high refresh rate, and that will dissuade many potential buyers. A wide range of alternatives, from the OnePlus 8 to the Samsung Galaxy S20, offer a high refresh rate as either a standard feature or an optional mode.The LG Velvet’s display isn’t the brightest, and I found the brightness needed to be maxed out when in the sunlight or watching video during the day. I also found the palm rejection was a little over-sensitive when gripping the phone’s slightly curved edges. Still, the LG Velvet’s screen is solid overall, and is supported by strong audio.The camera lenses on the back of the LG Velvet are arranged in an attractive raindrop formation. You’ll find a 48-megapixel f/1.8 sensor, an 8-megapixel f/2.2 sensor, and a 5-megapixel f/2.4 depth sensor.On paper, this isn’t great, not when some mid-range phones cost less than the LG Velvet and offer more. Motorola’s Edge Plus, for example, ramps the main sensor up to 108MP, and it’s not alone. Other options, like Samsung and Huawei flagships, double down on zoom.Does real-world performance overcome these perceived spec limitations? Not really, no.The LG Velvet’s camera is far from bad, but it is inconsistent, and that can be frustrating. The wide-angle takes very sharp photos with a strong HDR effect with bright blue skies, amped up greens, and strong reds. Use the main lens, however, and the camera forgets all about that, taking photos that are a little washed out. Sometimes, it will over-sharpen shots to the point where they look otherworldly.The bokeh portrait mode has poor edge detection, the zoom mode (which is not supported by a telephoto lens) stretches to just 2x (and the results aren’t great), and the app frustrates when trying to switch between wide-angle, standard, and 2x modes.I also lost count of the number of times I activated Google Assistant instead of quickly opening the camera from the lock screen’s swipe-up shortcut.On the plus side, there are strong levels of detail in many photos, and if you’re OK with the HDR look, some of the wide-angle shots are instantly shareable.The inconsistencies are something LG could fix, or at least alleviate, through software updates. As tested here, however, it needs improvement to stand out. Flagship phones have good cameras as a rule, and the best are truly exceptional. LG’s Velvet can’t clear that bar.The LG Velvet has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G with 5G connectivity, and either 6GB or 8GB of RAM depending on the model available where you live. My review phone has 6GB of RAM. Here’s some benchmark results:3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 2,708 (Vulkan)Geekbench 5: 1856 Multi Core/580 Single CoreThe Motorola Edge is a strong competitor for the LG Velvet, and its results are essentially the same. I also didn’t notice any major differences in general everyday performance or gameplay. Asphalt 9 Legends is great with the standard graphics settings, and 1945 played smoothly. Casual gaming suits the Snapdragon 756G, but it can’t match phones with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865, like the OnePlus 8, which is a very strong alternative to the LG Velvet.Like the Motorola Edge, the LG Velvet is fast enough for everyday use. It doesn’t get hot, it plays casual games without a problem, and does everything I wanted without fuss. Hardcore mobile gamers will want the flagship chip, but if you do things like watch videos, use social networking apps, make calls, and take photos, you’ll be happy with the Velvet’s performance. Call quality is also good, but as my local area does not have 5G connectivity, so I could not test this feature out.The LG Velvet has Android 10 with the June 1, 2020, Android security patch, plus LG’s own user interface over the top. It’s closer to Samsung’s OneUI than it is to Android on a Google Pixel, but is neat, colorful, and consistent in design. An app tray and conventionally laid out notification shade join a great gesture control system, which is fast and fluid. However, I do find some of the app animations slow, such as opening a folder to then open an app. It takes a beat longer than it should, and is especially noticeable coming from a non-LG phone.A 4,300mAh battery keeps the screen lit on the Velvet, with 25W wired charging and wireless charging to keep it topped up. The screen has a fingerprint sensor set very low on it. Just like the LG G8X ThinQ, face unlock isn’t available. I would like it there for convenience, but the fingerprint sensor is obviously more secure, and is thankfully fast and reliable here.Lockdown restrictions mean my phone has mostly been connected to Wi-Fi, with my average daily usage hovering around two or three hours, with video calls, voice calls, apps, and the camera at the top of my use list.The battery has lasted well, but not as well as other phones under the same conditions. It was down to 10% on my hardest use days by the time I was going to bed, which makes me suspect it won’t last longer than a single day when not connected to Wi-Fi.LG offered its own take on dual-screen mobile phones with a case of the LG G8X ThinQ. Instead of going all-in on a folding screen, LG uses a second screen attached to a case. It’s a heavier, less elegant solution than Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, but more affordable and (probably) more durable long-term.This time, the Dual Screen case is sold separately rather than bundled together, like it was with the LG G8X ThinQ. It adds a second 6.8-inch P-OLED screen to the Velvet, wrapping it all up in a protective white or black plastic case, complete with a small 2.1-inch screen on the front so you can still check the time and see notification alerts.I didn’t mind covering the LG G8X ThinQ up in the case, as it’s not especially pretty, but the Velvet is different.I didn’t want to put it in a case, and disliked the bulk it added to the slender Velvet. It adds 129 grams to the 180 gram LG Velvet, a significant increase, and takes the overall depth to 14.4mm, up from 7.9mm without the Dual Screen case fitted. It doesn’t have a battery of its own and takes power from the phone. To recharge the Velvet with the case attached you have to use a small magnetic adapter, which is definitely at risk of being lost.So it’s a miss, then?Actually, there is a lot to like with the Dual Screen, if you can overcome the additional size. From having a separate browser window open to using the case’s 360-degree hinge to create a stand to watch video, and using the main screen as a set of controls for selected games, it can be useful. The interface is solid too, and using it is logical and straightforward.LG told me they expect people to take the case on and off, rather than leave it on all the time. Indeed, though the screen folds around the back of the phone so it doesn’t get in the way, I preferred to take the case off for general use. On the other hand, I rarely found a compelling reason to put it back on again.The LG Velvet has been priced at 650 euros in Europe, which converts to around $735. LG has not announced the official price in the U.S., and in the past has left price details to local carriers. The launch date in the U.S. is also unknown at the time of writing, but the phone is now available to buy in South Korea and parts of Europe, so expect more news soon.The LG Velvet is a significant step forward for LG in phone design, and the screen is as beautiful as you’ll see on most other phones, but it’s a shame it has not made similar strides forward with the camera. I love the svelte body, the performance is more than adequate for most people, and the battery life is decent.However, I need a camera that will take great photos all the time, and the Velvet doesn’t quite deliver. This is the phone’s biggest weakness, and will take the Velvet out of contention for frequent smartphone photographers.Using the euro price as our basis for comparison, the LG Velvet is positioned to take on the OnePlus 8, which costs 699 euros, and the Motorola Edge, which costs 599 euros. Expect these phones to compete with the LG Velvet when it launches in the U.S. and the U.K.The OnePlus 8 is the better purchase due to the faster processor, better camera, higher screen refresh rate, and excellent software. However, the LG Velvet is lighter and more attractive, which helps it stand out. The OnePlus 8 and LG Velvet both defeat the Motorola Edge, which also has a mediocre camera and struggles with some software quirks.The LG Velvet may be slim and sleek, but it’s also tough. The body has an IP68 water resistance rating, and meets the MIL-STD 810G toughness tests, so it’s going to be durable. The 5G connection makes the Velvet a good buy for the future too, as even if you don’t have a 5G signal in your area now, it may come later, and the phone gives you the option of trying it out without buying a new phone.Android 10 is installed now, making the software current. The company has been slow to update older phones to Android 10, which means any update to Android 11 later this year may not arrive very quickly.Yes. The LG Velvet is an attractive, lightweight phone that scores well across the board, though it lacks a single standout feature."
26,LG Wing,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-wing-review/,"If the LG Velvet was LG being sensible, then the LG Wing is LG being quite, quite mad. The crazy swivel-screen hardware is totally different from any other phone you can buy, and although it could be seen as a quirky alternative to a folding smartphone, it’s really not.I’m actually not entirely sure what the LG Wing is. While the hardware is joyous, the software can’t keep up with the innovative design. This means I have found very few reasons to rotate the screen, and that’s a real shame. Let’s go into more detail.The LG Wing has two screens, with the large 6.8-inch P-OLED main screen swiveling to a 180-degree landscape orientation to reveal a smaller, 3.9-inch second screen underneath. The phone takes on a T-shape at this point, and the result is a phone that you hold naturally with one hand, yet can still watch video in landscape orientation at the same time.First, the phone is superbly made. Forget about the Wing feeling fragile — it doesn’t. And don’t worry that the rotated screen will break off with regular use either, because it has been tested to 200,000 rotations. The action is delightful, with expertly weighted dampening to slow the screen’s spin. And the hinge is set to the perfect point to take over when you flick it around with your thumb.The LG Wing is no concept phone. The hardware feels absolutely final and built to last. It’s compliant with the MIL-STD-810G toughness standard and is IP54 splash-resistant (not to be confused with the usual high-end IP68). The shape and in-hand comfort when the phone is folded is reminiscent of the LG Velvet. This is a seriously weighty phone at 260 grams — the Velvet is only 180 grams — and it’s thick, too, at 10.9mm. The result is a phone that tugs your trousers down.I like the color, called Illusion Sky. The blue shimmers in the light, then morphs into purple, silver, green, and pink at different angles. With the screen rotated, some ergonomic issues make themselves known, mostly with the volume and power keys. These are set too closely to the rotated screen and are very hard to push in this orientation, and the in-display fingerprint sensor is similarly awkward to reach. This is not very helpful should the phone go to sleep, or a video play at an ear-splitting volume. The main screen also takes its smooth curved edges with it when it’s flipped round, leaving the lower screen’s far less comfortable sharp edges for you to grip.Yes, the phone is natural to hold in T mode, but every time I did so, I questioned whether it was really different than holding any other phone in landscape orientation. Superbly executed and genuinely unusual, the LG Wing is an eye-catching phone that will make people do a double take, but you may end up not using the flip screen all that often.I love LG’s ideas. Since letting the crazier designers back into the lab following a period of dullness, we’ve had the sleek new Velvet, several Dual Screen phones, and now a swiveling phone. It’s wonderful. However, as cool as the out-there design is, it’s all for nothing if the software doesn’t keep up, or app developers aren’t on board. Like LG’s Dual Screen cases, the current state of the Wing’s app support can’t quite convince me to use the swivel screen more often.For a new type of phone to be successful, it has to fit into our lives. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 does this very well — because the vast majority of apps work on the large screen straightaway, there was no real period of adjustment. All Samsung’s folding phones make me want to open and close the phone, and much as I want to swivel the LG Wing’s screen, it quite often doesn’t make much sense to do so.Why? An example is when you come across an embedded video on Twitter. With the phone closed. it plays as normal, and when you swivel the screen. it switches to landscape, but the Twitter app doesn’t automatically appear on the lower screen so you can continue browsing. If you open the Twitter app on the small screen, it pulls the video from the swiveled screen and plays it there instead.The menu across the swiveled screen shows YouTube as an option, but when you open it up, the display is YouTube in landscape orientation, which is a dire mobile experience. It would have been better to switch this to the portrait lower screen, so when you selected a video, it played on the swiveled screen. It does do this when you use the Naver Whale browser, preinstalled on the phone, when you access the mobile site.I do like that when you do play a video, controls are displayed on the lower screen, and how the Gallery app shows your chosen photo on the rotated screen. Playing Asphalt 9 Legends shows it has been adapted for the Wing, with a map of the track displayed on the lower screen. And the Naver Whale browser does improve the browsing experience across the two screens, but you will have to adjust to using it rather than your usual browser of choice.When you get in the flow of using the Wing with a properly adapted app or feature, it’s a glimpse of what the LG Wing could be like with wider app support, but otherwise, it often ends up being a bit confusing and not very user-friendly. The result of all this is I simply used the phone closed, as figuring out what may happen when I did swivel the screen was often impossible. Unfortunately, this rather defeats the objective.The main camera on the back has 64 megapixels and optical image stabilization, a second camera has 13MP and shoots in wide-angle, and a third camera also has 64MP, but only shoots when the screen is swiveled and is primarily for video. That third camera is rotated to match the swiveled screen’s orientation to shoot in landscape. Very smart. It’s here that LG’s clever digital gimbal system fires up, steadying your shots and allowing for a variety of movements without introducing camera shake or blur.This feature is probably the most successful on the LG Wing, but arguably it’s usability is not dependent on the screen rotating. The stabilization — which is entirely digital, rather than with hardware like a true gimbal or the Vivo X50 Pro — is very effective, keeping the image steady when walking or running, and when tracking moving objects. Its benefits are really only seen in specific situations, though.Controlling the camera in gimbal mode is easy, with a precise and responsive virtual joystick and other controls on the lower screen. The LG Wing’s T mode also helps you hold the phone more naturally when shooting and gives you more control over position, just like a real gimbal does — but there’s no reason the technology couldn’t be used on a normal phone too.Shooting stills with the standard camera shows some great HDR effects and plenty of pop, but the wide-angle camera has a tendency to look rather washed-out and drab. There’s a digital 2x zoom marked in the camera app, and the photos it takes have a decent level of detail despite it not being an optical zoom.The camera has various gimmicky modes to play around with, too. For example, you can shoot video using the rear and selfie camera at the same time, record audio for ASMR video, and choose from different bokeh effects using portrait mode. Video-editing tools appear on the second screen in T mode, but oddly, there are no tools for editing still photos at all, and the Gallery app opens either Google Photos or Snapseed if it’s installed.The LG Wing has a Snapdragon 765G 5G processor and 8GB of RAM inside, and Android 10 with LG’s own clean user interface customizations. It’s fast and reliable. Although it’s technically not a flagship, if you use your phone normally for typical apps and communication, and don’t constantly play high-end games on your phone, you probably won’t notice much of a difference between this and one with a Snapdragon 865.Here are some benchmark results:3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 2992 (Vulkan)Geekbench 5: 1888 Multi Core/ 602 Single CoreThis is equal to the OnePlus Nord, and a moderate improvement over the scores achieved by the Velvet and the Motorola Edge, but not as high as the Snapdragon 865-equipped OnePlus 8 or OnePlus 8 Pro. I have not noticed any drastic performance issues, although the animations and switch between screens when you open and close the screen tend to stutter and result in a small delay.It’s a shame that like the Velvet, the Wing’s screen does not have a high refresh rate, sticking with 60Hz, rather than a clearer, easier-on-the-eye 90Hz or higher. But in the positive column, the 4,000mAh battery lasts an entire day and usually ends up around 30% with a couple of hours video calls included. Without those, it would easily last two days. It supports both Quick Charge 4.0 and wireless charging.Full details of the LG Wing’s availability will be confirmed after release, but we do know Verizon will sell the phone for $999, and that pre-orders are already live, with a release date of October 15.The smartphone world would be less interesting if the LG Wing didn’t exist, but this unusual take on the multiscreen phone trend doesn’t captivate like the Galaxy Z Fold 2 or Motorola Razr, due to the software struggling to provide true everyday uses for the innovative hardware. It’s technically very impressive, but when you end up using it like every other bar-shaped smartphone, it’s hard to justify spending $1,000 to get one.Yes. The LG Wing’s high price hurts it, particularly as there are many excellent midrange phones with the Snapdragon 765G processor out this year, including the new $699 Google Pixel 5, the the $699 Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, the OnePlus Nord, and the Nokia 8.3 5G. If you want to spend $1,000 on a phone, the OnePlus 8 Pro has a far higher specification for the money, and the forthcoming slate of iPhone 12 models are always there if you want something different entirely.If you want something a little different, the Asus Zenfone 7 Pro’s rotating camera arguably offers more versatility and day-to-day functionality than the LG Wing’s swivel screen, and it has a higher specification for a lower price.The LG Wing is on paper surprisingly resilient for such a complex piece of hardware. The MIL-STD-810G standard doesn’t make it impervious from harm, but definitely helps keep it safe, plus it has a splash-proof coating for an IP54 rating. There’s even a custom case in the box.LG’s software updates aren’t as rapid as we’d like, and the Wing launches with Android 10 on board, and with no Android 11 update for the Velvet announced yet, we expect the Wing is likely to wait until sometime in early 2021 to see the new software. The phone does have 5G on board, which adds to its longevity, despite it not being a major selling point today.There’s no reason the LG Wing won’t last you for the duration of a two-year financing plan, and with luck during that time, LG will make the swivel screen and associated apps more useful.No. I love the hardware execution, but if all I do is use the phone when it’s closed, it’s not really worth paying extra for the swivel screen in the first place."
27,Moto E (2020),Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/motorola-moto-e-2020-review/,"Motorola has long been a go-to company for budget phones. The Moto E was first launched in 2014, and quickly became a fan favorite for those who want a decent phone for around $150. Six years later, the company is continuing the tradition with a new Moto E model that boasts a relatively modern design, midrange specs, and more.While the Moto E has remained a great option over the years, plenty of competition has popped up. Does the new Moto E still compete with the best phones under $200?Edge-to-edge displays have made their way to some of the cheapest phones out there — and the Moto E is jumping aboard that train. The device has a small chin at the bottom and a teardrop notch at the top, but it still looks great for a phone in this price range.The display sits in at 6.2 inches, and the bezels around it are relatively slim. That’s good news — it means that the phone looks modern despite its price range.The back of the phone looks good too. The phone is made largely from plastic, and while it doesn’t feel as premium as more expensive devices, it doesn’t feel overly cheap either. On the back of the phone, you’ll get a fingerprint sensor under the Motorola logo and a vertically aligned camera array.Around the edges of the phone, you’ll get a pretty standard setup, including a volume rocker and power button on the right, as well as a SIM/MicroSD card slot, also on the right. There’s also a headphone jack on the top, which is good news for those who still use wired headphones.On the bottom, you’ll get a Micro-USB port, which is a little frustrating to see. The Moto E may be a budget phone, but it’s 2020, and USB-C should be the standard on all phones by now.The display on the Moto E is pretty much what you would expect from a $150 phone in 2020. It has a 720p resolution, and it’s an LCD display, so don’t expect much. It also seems to be slightly different than the display on the new Moto G Fast, as it can’t get quite as bright. If you’re outside and in direct sunlight, you may have some issues being able to see the display clearly.Under the hood, the Moto E offers a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor coupled with 2GB of RAM. I found that while it’s not necessarily able to handle heavy multitasking or intense mobile gaming, it definitely does the job for most day-to-day use, and certainly outperforms a lot of the competition in this price range.Generally speaking, most users will be more than happy with the performance of this device. If you’re switching between more than a few apps at a time, you may have to deal with slowdowns and skips in the software, but those usually resolved themselves quickly, and the device was still more than usable. The same is true for Chrome tabs — basic web browsing is perfectly fine, but anything heavier and you’ll want to consider a more powerful phone.Basic mobile gaming is also doable on this phone, but don’t expect much more than the basics. Call of Duty: Mobile was playable, though it wasn’t the smoothest experience out there. The Moto G Fast, or if possible, the Moto G Power, will perform better.If you’re really serious about mobile gaming, you’re going to want a phone with at least a Snapdragon 7xx-series SoC, or an iPhone. Budget phones are outmatched. This isn’t necessarily a problem unique to the Moto E, but rather a compromise all budget phones make to reach a lower price point.Benchmarks confirm decent performance for the price. The phone scored 118,004 on AnTuTu, which isn’t bad. For comparison, last year’s Moto G7 Play scored 98,111, while the higher-performing Google Pixel 3a scored 157,902. The Moto G Fast, which is $50 more expensive, hit 161,672.The battery capacity on the phone comes in at 3,550mAh, and we found that in day-to-day use, it performed fine. The battery should get you through a day of normal use, but heavy users may find that they have to charge the device before the end of the day. Don’t expect it to get too far into the next day. The phone does not offer wireless charging, nor does it have fast charging, so you’ll need to get into the routine of charging it at night, or if you work at a desk, when you’re working.The 2020 Moto E offers a dual-sensor camera, though one of those sensors is a 2-megapixel lens only used to capture depth information. The other sensor is a 13-megapixel lens with an f/2.0 aperture and, generally speaking, it’s fine. But only fine.In well-lit environments, the Moto E is able to capture decent photos, with solid color reproduction and depth of field.  While photos weren’t incredibly detailed, that won’t be such a big deal for most uses.Of course, you won’t always be in well-lit environments. When you’re not, you’re more or less out of luck. While more expensive phones are capturing better and better low-light photos, there’s no night mode to speak of on this phone — as a result, badly lit photos either look noisy, or you can’t see the subject at all.Around the front, there’s a 5-megapixel selfie camera, and it does the job in a pinch. Like the rear-facing camera, it doesn’t perform in low light, and it’s definitely susceptible to unnaturally bright colors in some situations. Still, it’s usable for most social media posts.The Moto E is a budget phone, and it has a budget camera. It’ll do the job in most situations, but don’t expect incredible photos, and don’t expect to be able to use it in low light.The software experience on modern Motorola phones is great. With the Moto G Fast and Moto E, the company has rebranded its Android skin as My UX. Apart from a name change, not much else is different — you’ll still get the nea- stock experience with only a few minor tweaks that honestly make the experience even better.Perhaps the best thing about My UX compared to stock Android are the Moto Actions, which allow you to control certain aspects of the phone’s software with gestures. For example, you can take a screenshot with the tap of three fingers, or you can turn the flashlight on with a chopping motion. It’s a nice touch.My UX is built on Android 10, and Motorola has been pretty good about delivering software updates. That said, considering this is a budget phone, it may not get updates as quickly as you might want. The Moto G7, for example, didn’t receive Android 10 until May 2020.The Moto E is available straight from the Motorola website for $150, which is a great price for this phone. If you can stretch your budget a little, it’s worth considering the Moto G Fast, or if you can stretch even more, the Moto G Power.The Moto E comes with a one-year limited warranty, but that warranty really only covers manufacturer defects. It’s worth buying a case to protect the deviceThe Motorola Moto E is far from perfect, but for $150, it’s best option. It offers a relatively modern design, solid performance, and more, and if you’re buying on a budget, performance is one of the most important things to consider.If you’re willing to spend more money, then there are definitely better options. The $200 Moto G Fast is a solid phone, with better performance and much better battery life. If you can double your budget to $300, the Samsung Galaxy A51 or the Google Pixel 3a are worth considering. The Google Pixel 3a in particular is an excellent phone with an incredible camera.Under light use, the Moto E should last around two years. The phone’s performance will degrade over time, so don’t expect to have a smooth experience for that entire two-year period. Also, the phone has no water-resistance, so don’t take it near the bath or the pool.Yes, if you need a phone for $150 or less. If you can stretch your budget a little, it’s worth spending the extra cash."
28,Motorola Edge,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/motorola-edge-review/,"There’s so much the Motorola Edge gets right it almost makes me forget about the annoyances. It’s the best looking Motorola phone in ages, and yes, I do count the Moto Razr in that statement. The screen is a killer. What’s more, I’ve liked using it, especially because it’s light, compact, and disappears in my pocket or bag. It’s great for everyday use, if you’re not looking for a gaming-focused powerhouse with the best camera out there.However, there are a few irritations to do with the build quality, security, and the software, which are very frustrating and aren’t quite canceled out by the significant upsides. I’ve been using the phone for nearly two weeks now, and here’s the good and the bad in a lot more detail.The Motorola Edge is my favorite Motorola phone design in some time, and a prime reason is the 19.5:9 aspect ratio screen which slims the body right down, much like Sony did with the 21:9 aspect ratio Xperia 10 Plus. The advantage is the phone doesn’t require such a big stretch to hold, even though the screen is a giant 6.7 inches, and you can still reach on-screen buttons with your fingers. It even slips into your pocket nicely.The screen tumbles over either side of the phone in the same way as the Motorola Edge Plus and the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, and helps you forget the tall-and-slim aspect ratio by removing the side bezels. I think it looks great and although the functionality is shaky, more on that later, it gives the Edge a striking, modern look that’s rarely seen on widely available devices.At 188 grams, it’s light, but quite thick at 9.3mm, and the body is very slippery. It needs a case for long term usage because of this. The back of the phone is made from plastic, although it really does feel like glass, but it has already picked up a few unpleasant scratches on the back despite spending the majority of its time in the house. This is unfortunate, because I love the way the back of the Edge looks.Motorola’s decision not to make the phone wafer-thin means the camera module doesn’t stick out half a mile, and is instead almost flush to the back of the phone. The Motorola logo is etched under the highly reflective black case, which then takes on a rainbow effect in the right light. It’s reminiscent of Samsung’s Aura Glow color on the Galaxy Note 10 Plus.All good, then? No, not quite. My review Motorola Edge has a noticeable seam where the screen’s glass meets the body, and it’s not consistent all the way around the phone. Run your finger along the bottom left and it’s very pronounced, almost like the screen glass has been misaligned, while it’s perfectly smooth and matched in the top right corner. You don’t have to make an effort to find this either, as you notice every time you hold the phone.This is a problem with waterfall displays, as my Huawei Mate 30 Pro review model has exactly the same problem. It’s distracting and feels like poor build quality, whether it actually is or not. The Motorola Edge scores some serious points in design, and then manages to lose just as many.The 6.7-inch OLED touchscreen has 2340 x 1080-pixel resolution, a 90Hz refresh rate, and HDR10 support. The 19.5:9 aspect ratio is highly cinematic and gives the Edge a 95.9% screen-to-body ratio, interrupted only by a small hole-punch selfie camera, which is barely noticeable. The waterfall display makes wallpaper look superb, and when the phone is face down, a white notification light runs down the side that easily grabs your attention.Watching the always stunning Carfection channel on YouTube in 1080p, with the screen’s color profile set to Saturated, reveals the Edge’s screen emphasizes colors a great deal, but never over-saturates. Instead, you get a wonderful balance between blacks and shadows, with bright blues and reds, resulting in a engaging and pleasant visual experience. Compare it to the iPhone 11 Pro, with the Natural color profile active, and there are times when the Edge looks just as good, and that’s high praise indeed.HDR10 video plays without a problem, and some of the stunning movies look even better when you zoom in so it fills the whole of the screen, which at the same time brings the cascading edge into play. The audio is good too, with a single speaker on the bottom of the phone, plus audio from the speaker used for voice calls at the top of the screen. There’s plenty of volume and a decent amount of bass, but also a degree of vibration through the body of the phone. Overall, the Edge is an excellent media smartphone.The screen has a fingerprint sensor set underneath, and it’s slow, unreliable, and frustrating. It often takes several tries for it to recognize your finger and then a second or so to unlock the device, or worse, a second or two to actually activate the sensor in the first place. This means you tap the screen and press the power button, all in the hope of it waking up, only to make things worse when the software gets in a tizzy. Using face unlock as an alternative compromises security, and really isn’t much faster, either. Security on the Edge is a disappointment.My review Motorola Edge has Android 10 with the May 2020 security update installed, and Motorola’s very light customization over the top. Visually it’s very similar to the look of Android on a Google Pixel 4, with the swipe up app tray and swipe down notification shade being untouched, and all the gesture controls and notifications untouched. This is a good thing, as Android 10 is easy to use, attractive, and speedy.Motorola has added a selection of tools and features though, some of which are successful. I love the Peek Display, where notifications are delivered on the lock screen and a touch of the icon shows more information, and the Edge Light effect where the sides of the screen illuminate to alert you of a new notification grabbed my attention.How about the edge of the screen in general? Edge Touch lets you open the app tray and notification shade from the side of the screen, interact with some app shortcuts, and generally use the phone with one hand. It’s not very successful, and frequently misunderstood my touches. I turned it off. Even then, the accidental interactions don’t stop. I often open Google Assistant by accident, and frequently find I’ve moved apps around on the screen. Plus, tapping buttons on the edges of the screen is frustrating, as they often don’t work.One excellent feature is hidden away. Because some apps don’t play well with the waterfall screen, especially when text wraps itself around the edge making it hard to read, there is a way to switch any app from edgeless to a standard full-screen view. It’s found under the helicopter view of open apps, and by tapping the app icon. Very convenient, and a great way to avoid at least some of the annoyances caused by this type of display.Most apps performed without a problem, but not the standard camera app. It doesn’t want to be hurried at all, and if you try it often crashes, sometimes to the point where the phone needs a restart to operate again. This happens most often when opening the camera from the lock screen, either after unlocking it or when using the wrist twist quick gesture Motorola forces you to use instead of adding an icon to swipe. I’ve missed various photographic moments while the camera app falls over because of this.The camera app can be a pain, but what about the camera itself? On paper, it’s a solid performer with a 64-megapixel main camera with an f/1.8 aperture, a 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide camera, plus an 8-megapixel telephoto for 2x optical zoom shots. There’s also a time-of-flight sensor to help with portrait and bokeh shots. On the front is a 25-megapixel wide-angle selfie camera with an f/2.0 aperture.The results are good, but not quite as good as I expected, and it seems Motorola still needs to do some fine-tuning. The variation in exposure and dynamic range between the standard, wide-angle, and 2x zoom shots is considerable, and the wide-angle in particular struggles in difficult lighting. Colors are muted and the exposure too low. While it can be fixed with some editing, the shots aren’t shareable until you do tweak them, and that’s not acceptable.Shoot with the standard camera, and the photos are generally much better, but problems still remain with exposure. You can’t always tell when this will happen, making it hard to predict if a photo is going to come out well.I like the macro mode, which can take some very detailed close-up photos, and the portrait mode is good as well. However, the macro mode requires a very steady hand, while edges can be mistakenly blurred in portrait shots. Night mode does brighten pictures a little and without much impact on detail; but it’s not a drastic change like you’ll find on phones like the Huawei P40 Pro.Motorola’s camera app, when it’s not having problems opening, is well laid out apart from one thing. Motorola has put the Google Lens button right next to the shutter button, and it’s not only too easy to accidentally press, but is also easily mistaken for the button used to switch between rear and front cameras, which is annoyingly placed right off to the side. You can’t edit the primary feature switcher either, so you have to go into a separate menu to activate Night or Portrait mode. Selfies in good light are great, with strong colors and plenty of detail, but it’s not so good in low light even using the Night mode, and edge detection in portrait mode is haphazard.The Motorola Edge’s camera just isn’t very consistent, even though the hardware is good and it can take some great photos when the conditions are correct. It’s likely all down to software, which means future updates may bring improvements, but as it stands right now the Edge’s camera doesn’t inspire you to use it.The Motorola Edge does not use Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 865 chipset, but the Snapdragon 765G chipset. This will make many think it’s “midrange,” but performance in the real world is anything but. Normal, everyday tasks including taking photos, using email, making calls, and checking social media apps is as fluid and fast as you could want.Geekbench 5: 1785 Multi Core/573 Single Core3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 2800 (Vulkan)Looking at the benchmark results, things are different. The Motorola Edge’s closest competitor is the OnePlus 8, which has the Snapdragon 865 chipset inside, and it trounces these figures. Even the aging Asus Zenfone 6 using last year’s Snapdragon 855 processor leaves the Motorola in its dust. It does beat the Samsung Galaxy A51 though.The poor benchmark figures don’t translate into slowness, though. Asphalt 9 Legends is solid if you don’t turn the graphics right up, and DariusBurst is great too. No, the Motorola Edge isn’t really suitable for hardcore gamers, but for casual gaming it’s fine. Motorola has added a game mode that minimizes distractions, and also adds an option for virtual shoulder buttons, which are easily programmable for individual games.Motorola has done the right thing with the Edge’s battery. It has a 4,500mAh capacity, and it has absolutely no problem lasting two full days sometimes with energy to spare. Add a few video calls to this and you will have to charge it sometime during the evening on the second day though. Even though currently my phone mostly connects to Wi-Fi, the Edge usually ended a normal day with more than 60% power left, even when connected to a smartwatch and with voice calls, photos, and app use. This is excellent performance.It has 18W fast charging using the supplied charger, and this takes nearly an hour and 40 minutes to charge from zero to full, and only reached 26% after 20 minutes. There are faster charging systems available, and unfortunately, the Edge does not have wireless charging. Due to my local area not being a 5G coverage area, I have not been able to test the Edge’s 5G connectivity. However, I encountered no problems with regular calls and 4G LTE reception, but Wi-Fi did drop out sometimes when I was further away from my router. Many will also be happy to look at the bottom of the phone and see a 3.5mm headphone socket.The Motorola Edge costs 549 British pounds, or about $695, and is currently available for pre-order in the United Kingdom on Motorola’s own website, through the O2 network, and retailers including Amazon and Argos. A release in the United States has been indicated, but there are no details at the time of writing.The Motorola Edge has strong upsides and annoying downsides. The size, performance, and screen are excellent, plus long battery life is a serious advantage, the camera is decent, and the price is reasonable given the phone has 5G for the future. These advantages pay dividends on a daily basis, making it very easy to live with. Elsewhere it isn’t as good as it should be due to the software and security frustrations, but some aspects could be improved with software updates in the future.The Motorola Edge’s big challenger is the OnePlus 8. In the U.K. it costs 599 British pounds, or $699 in the U.S., and although it’s not the most exciting phone you can buy today, it’s very reliable and highly capable. It has 5G, ready for the future, and more performance than the Edge too. It’s the better purchase, unless you are able to stretch to the 799-British pound (or $899) OnePlus 8 Pro. Spend a little more again and the $999 (or 799-British pound) Samsung Galaxy S20 is a great phone. If you’re not settled on Android, the Apple iPhone 11 is also a superb purchase for $699, or 729 British pounds, with a great camera, design, software, and battery life.While 5G isn’t a benefit right now, it will become more desirable in the near future, and the Motorola Edge ensures you’re ready for the day without spending a fortune. It’s moderately durable with Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and plastic on the back, but as I’ve already discovered this can get scratched quite quickly. Motorola says the phone is water-repellent, but does not provide an IP rating, meaning it’ll be fine in the rain but not if you drop it in the bath.Motorola says the Edge is guaranteed to receive Android 11, but according to the company, it’s not certain any will arrive after this. Based on this, you should only expect a single major Android update after purchase, and that’s not great.Yes, despite the annoyances, the Motorola Edge’s overall everyday ability is excellent, and therefore is still worth buying if you’re taken by the screen and design."

Normal, everyday tasks including taking photos, using email, making calls, and checking social media apps is as fluid and fast as you could want.Geekbench 5: 1785 Multi Core/573 Single Core3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 2800 (Vulkan)Looking at the benchmark results, things are different. The Motorola Edge’s closest competitor is the OnePlus 8, which has the Snapdragon 865 chipset inside, and it trounces these figures. Even the aging Asus Zenfone 6 using last year’s Snapdragon 855 processor leaves the Motorola in its dust. It does beat the Samsung Galaxy A51 though.The poor benchmark figures don’t translate into slowness, though. Asphalt 9 Legends is solid if you don’t turn the graphics right up, and DariusBurst is great too. No, the Motorola Edge isn’t really suitable for hardcore gamers, but for casual gaming it’s fine. Motorola has added a game mode that minimizes distractions, and also adds an option for virtual shoulder buttons, which are easily programmable for individual games.Motorola has done the right thing with the Edge’s battery. It has a 4,500mAh capacity, and it has absolutely no problem lasting two full days sometimes with energy to spare. Add a few video calls to this and you will have to charge it sometime during the evening on the second day though. Even though currently my phone mostly connects to Wi-Fi, the Edge usually ended a normal day with more than 60% power left, even when connected to a smartwatch and with voice calls, photos, and app use. This is excellent performance.It has 18W fast charging using the supplied charger, and this takes nearly an hour and 40 minutes to charge from zero to full, and only reached 26% after 20 minutes. There are faster charging systems available, and unfortunately, the Edge does not have wireless charging. Due to my local area not being a 5G coverage area, I have not been able to test the Edge’s 5G connectivity. However, I encountered no problems with regular calls and 4G LTE reception, but Wi-Fi did drop out sometimes when I was further away from my router. Many will also be happy to look at the bottom of the phone and see a 3.5mm headphone socket.The Motorola Edge costs 549 British pounds, or about $695, and is currently available for pre-order in the United Kingdom on Motorola’s own website, through the O2 network, and retailers including Amazon and Argos. A release in the United States has been indicated, but there are no details at the time of writing.The Motorola Edge has strong upsides and annoying downsides. The size, performance, and screen are excellent, plus long battery life is a serious advantage, the camera is decent, and the price is reasonable given the phone has 5G for the future. These advantages pay dividends on a daily basis, making it very easy to live with. Elsewhere it isn’t as good as it should be due to the software and security frustrations, but some aspects could be improved with software updates in the future.The Motorola Edge’s big challenger is the OnePlus 8. In the U.K. it costs 599 British pounds, or $699 in the U.S., and although it’s not the most exciting phone you can buy today, it’s very reliable and highly capable. It has 5G, ready for the future, and more performance than the Edge too. It’s the better purchase, unless you are able to stretch to the 799-British pound (or $899) OnePlus 8 Pro. Spend a little more again and the $999 (or 799-British pound) Samsung Galaxy S20 is a great phone. If you’re not settled on Android, the Apple iPhone 11 is also a superb purchase for $699, or 729 British pounds, with a great camera, design, software, and battery life.While 5G isn’t a benefit right now, it will become more desirable in the near future, and the Motorola Edge ensures you’re ready for the day without spending a fortune. It’s moderately durable with Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and plastic on the back, but as I’ve already discovered this can get scratched quite quickly. Motorola says the phone is water-repellent, but does not provide an IP rating, meaning it’ll be fine in the rain but not if you drop it in the bath.Motorola says the Edge is guaranteed to receive Android 11, but according to the company, it’s not certain any will arrive after this. Based on this, you should only expect a single major Android update after purchase, and that’s not great.Yes, despite the annoyances, the Motorola Edge’s overall everyday ability is excellent, and therefore is still worth buying if you’re taken by the screen and design."
30,Nokia 1.3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-3-1-plus-review/,"HMD Global is making a major push into North America this year, and its first smartphone on a U.S. carrier is the Nokia 3.1 Plus on Cricket Wireless. It’s no flashy flagship — costing just $160 — but you wouldn’t be able to tell it cost so little from using it day-to-day. With fantastic battery life and solid performance, it comes close to being great, but the camera holds this budget smartphone back.The Nokia 3.1 Plus looks and feels like it deserves a higher price tag. It shares a resemblance to many other Nokia phones we’ve seen from HMD, with a centrally-placed vertical camera setup as well as a fingerprint sensor on the back. The blue-and-matte look makes it stand out from the sea of black phones.While it looks good, the Nokia 3.1 Plus feels great. Its heft makes it more substantial. The rear is polycarbonate along an aluminum frame, not glass, which means you can worry less about breaking the phone. The phone feels like a brick, and like Nokia phones of old, you could probably toss it across a room without much damage (but don’t try it, please).The edges are rounded, so the phone can sit comfortably in your hand. It’s large, though, so you might find it tough to reach the top of the screen when holding it with one hand, since it has a tall 18:9 aspect ratio. Those in favor of smaller phones may find it too big.The matte back tends to pick up smudges, but they’re easy to wipe away. The polycarbonate shell is removable. A small lip at the bottom, by the USB-C charging port, helps pry it off. It’s only for inserting a MicroSD card or SIM card. You can’t replace the battery. The MicroSD card will come in handy, as this phone only comes with 32GB of internal storage, which can fill up quickly. You’ll also be happy to see a headphone jack along the top of the phone.The Nokia 3.1 Plus looks and feels like it deserves a higher price tag.Chunky bezels surround the 5.99-inch IPS LCD screen. The top bezel has the earpiece, a Nokia logo, and the selfie camera. The bottom bezel, also known as the “chin,” doesn’t house anything. It doesn’t follow the bezel-less trend for phones, but the Nokia 3.1 Plus doesn’t look too dated. The screen has rounded corners to help it look more modern.The screen boasts 1,440 x 720 resolution. It’s easy to see individual pixels if you bring the phone close to your eyes, but they’re tough to spot at a normal viewing distance. Colors look a little muted, and viewing angles aren’t great, so it’s tough to identify what’s on the screen when looking at it in an angle. Our biggest gripe is that the display is a bit dim, so we had trouble seeing it clearly in broad daylight.The best word for the screen is “adequate.” Videos on Netflix and YouTube never look sharp, and colors look washed out. We compared it with the similarly-priced Moto E5 Plus (also on Cricket Wireless) and found the Motorola phone offered better image quality and more realistic colors, which we preferred over the slightly brighter Nokia phone. We wouldn’t want to use the Nokia 3.1 Plus to binge-watch a whole series, but it’s manageable if you must.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has been available in international markets for some time, but the U.S. model is slightly different. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 processor with 2GB RAM instead of the MediaTek chipset in the global edition. The performance should be comparable, and it’s satisfactory.Everything happens more slowly than on a flagship phone, which is understandable. Apps take a few moments to load and transitioning to another takes a little longer. The fingerprint sensor is finicky, and you may see some stutters when scrolling through apps like Instagram and Twitter. But remembering the $160 price tag, we were surprised at how many everyday tasks we could complete on the Nokia 3.1 Plus.Benchmark scores place this phone higher than other phones in a similar price bracket, like the Moto E5 Plus. That makes sense, as it uses a slightly better processor. In terms of gaming, expect to only play games that don’t require much graphical power. We could hardly get through a game of PUBG: Mobile due to slow frame rates. Games like Breakneck and Alto’s Odyssey were playable, but we had to deal with slight stutters during gameplay. Simpler titles should pose no issue, but this is not ideal for heavy mobile gamers.Simple titles should pose no issue, but this phone is not ideal for heavy mobile gamers.This is not the phone to buy if your job heavily relies on your smartphone and you need to perform tasks quickly. The Nokia 3.1 Plus may surprise you with its capability, but it will require just a little patience. We strongly recommend the OnePlus 6T for people looking for strong performance on a budget, though it’s really in a different league of pricing.Another reasonable option is the Moto G7 Play, which is available in the spring. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 600-series processor, and it only costs $40 more than the Nokia 3.1 Plus.Most Nokia phones from HMD Global run Google’s Android One software, which means it’s the pure, unaltered version of Android straight from Google. That means the phones receive fast version and security updates straight from Google, and there’s almost zero bloatware. Unfortunately, to sell its phones in U.S. carrier stores, HMD had to drop the Android One branding — neither the Nokia 2V on Verizon or the Nokia 3.1 Plus are a part of the program.HMD said it plans to work with carrier partners to deliver fast updates to these phones. We can only hold the company to its word. Thankfully, it has a good track record so far — it’s one of the only manufacturers that has delivered Android Pie (the latest version) to many already-released phones. However, you’ll have to deal with bloatware when you first boot up the Nokia 3.1 Plus. Apps like Amazon Shopping, Candy Crush Friends, Candy Crush Saga, Daily Pedometer, Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, Yahoo! Finance, and more come pre-installed on the phone, eating up valuable storage space. Thankfully, you can uninstall almost all of these and never have to worry about them after setting the phone up.As another positive, the Nokia’s 3.1 Plus does run Android 9 Pie, and it just may be one the cheapest phones around with it. The software interface is dead simple to use, and best of all it looks good.HMD says it plans to work with carrier partners to deliver fast updates.One feature we like about this phone is the inclusion of a near-field communication (NFC) sensor. This is often non-existent on budget phones — see Motorola’s latest Moto G7 range, which costs more than the Nokia 3.1 Plus — but the inclusion here means you can use the Nokia phone for contactless payments via Google Pay, or share files and more through Android’s native Beam technology.The Nokia 3.1 has a dual-camera setup on the back. It’s a 13-megapixel lens paired with a second 5-megapixel lens. This combination allows for Live Bokeh photos — known as Portrait Mode on other phones – but that’s the only bonus feature. Optical zoom is MIA, which we didn’t really expect on such a cheap phone.The specs look fine, but the results sadly fall short. We’ve hardly captured a photo that’s sharp in all our time testing the Nokia 3.1 Plus. Even outdoor photos taken in broad daylight, which budget phones like the Moto E5 Plus and the Nokia 6.1 can handle, look fuzzy. Any kind of movement, whether it’s from the subject or your shaky hands, will produce a blurry photo. The camera has trouble focusing in low-light scenarios, so the photos are often unusable.The Live Bokeh feature produces surprisingly accurate blurred effects around subjects, but they’re not any sharper. The 8-megapixel camera on the front can take decent selfies, but it’s no better than the competition.Decent photos occasionally came out of the Nokia 3.1 Plus, but most of the time we opted to avoid using the camera. It’s disappointing, as there’s a lot to like about the phone, and it’s not like there aren’t better cameras in this price range. The Moto E5 Plus can take better photos, and it costs around the same (depending on where you buy it from), but the new Moto G7 Play that costs $200 should be able to beat out the Nokia 3.1 Plus easily.The camera is the biggest weakness of the Nokia 3.1 Plus.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has a 3,500mAh battery, and the company said the phone should last for two days on a single charge.That’s perhaps a little optimistic with mid-to-high smartphone usage, but for the most part it’s an accurate claim. We often ended the work day with around 50 percent remaining on the phone by 6 p.m. That’s with using it to play games like Breakneck, stream music, capture photos, respond to notifications, and browse social media. We didn’t charge the phone and managed to reach 15 percent by 2 p.m. the next day. With lighter use, the Nokia 3.1 Plus can reach two days of use.In our video playback battery test, the Nokia 3.1 Plus lasted a whopping 6 and a half hours running a YouTube video with brightness cranked to the max. It beats out phones like the iPhone 8, which does have a smaller battery. It’s worth noting the Moto E5 Plus (aka the Moto E5 Supra on Cricket Wireless) has a 5,000mAh battery capacity, so it lasts closer to two full days than the Nokia phone, with the potential to hit three days on a single charge.On a Saturday when we didn’t use the phone much, the phone had 75 percent remaining by 10 p.m. — it does a great job of conserving battery life when in standby mode, which helps.But the best part of the phone is that it has a USB-C charging port. Most budget phones in this range — like the Moto E5 Supra — use MicroUSB ports. USB-C is far more versatile, allows for faster charging. It’s a port used in various products now like laptops too, which means people only need to carry one type of charging cable.The Nokia 3.1 Plus is $160, and is exclusively available from Cricket Wireless in the U.S.HMD Global offers a standard one-year warranty for its products sold in the U.S., which covers manufacturer defects and not much else.There are a lot of good phones you can buy under $300, but the under $200 crowd is still small. The Nokia 3.1 Plus is a solid entry. The performance is decent, battery life is great, and HMD promises to update the phone to new Android versions as they come. But the camera sets it back, negating the small wins it earns over the Moto E5 Plus (like NFC for Google Pay and a USB-C port).We bring up the Moto E5 Plus because it’s our favorite phone under $200, but we’d say you should hold off on purchasing either the Nokia 3.1 Plus or the Moto E5 Plus. The Moto G7 Play, which we’ve brought up already, will offer even greater value — particularly in the performance and camera department — and we believe it’s worth waiting for when it arrives in spring.Our favorite phone under $300 at the moment is the 2018 Nokia 6.1, though the newer G7 Power or standard Moto G7 will likely overtake it after our testing. HMD will be unveiling new phones at Mobile World Congress in 2019, so it’s worth waiting until Feb. 24 to find out if there are new entries to its budget categories that could take over our current favorites.If you absolutely want to own a Nokia phone on a budget, you can’t go wrong with the Nokia 7.1. While it does ratchet the price up to $350, it offers fantastic build quality, a capable camera, and a much better display.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has no water resistance rating, so be sure to keep it away from liquids. It does feel like a brick, so it may be able to withstand drops better than other phones, but a case is always worthwhile.Though the phone isn’t part of the Android One program, HMD promises it will work with Cricket Wireless to push out timely version and security updates. We’ll just have to wait to see if the company comes through. We expect it to last two years, at the least.Only if you’re a diehard Nokia fan and don’t want to spend more than $200. You’ll be disappointed by the camera. If you can spend slightly more, wait for the Moto G7 Play, or HMD’s upcoming MWC announcements."
31,Nokia 5.3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/hmd-global-nokia-5-3-review/,"Highly capable smartphones that cost $400 will do everything many people would want from a mobile, but what about phones that cost half that much? HMD Global’s Nokia 5.3 costs just $199, or 149 British pounds, yet after using the phone for a week, I can safely say it doesn’t feel like you’re halving the quality and ability of a more expensive model — in most areas, at least.The Nokia 5.3 will surprise you with its features, software, and overall ability as an everyday smartphone. No, the camera and the screen aren’t up there with the best models, but you shouldn’t expect them to be. Buy the Nokia 5.3 knowing what it can and can’t do beforehand, and you’ll get one of the best smartphone values I’ve seen in a while.The rear panel on the Nokia 5.3 is made from a composite plastic material which is grippy but lacks a pleasant texture. It also has some flex to it and curves around the side to meet the plastic frame, which then leads into the 6.55-inch screen. The phone is 8.5mm thick and weighs only 185 grams. It’s manageable in the hand, but is wide, so owners with small hands may find it ungainly.In addition to the volume rocker and SIM tray, there are two other buttons on the Nokia 5.3’s body. The power button is an obvious necessity, and it sits below the volume rocker. It has a notification light built into it that is bright and noticeable, and it pulses when you have messages waiting for you on the phone. This is useful in the absence of an always-on screen, plus the positioning is unusual and eye-catching.The second button feels superfluous. It’s on the opposite side and calls Google Assistant up. I often pressed it by accident when picking up the phone or juggling it with one hand. It’s annoying, as it adds several extra steps when trying to unlock the phone, or takes extra seconds to cancel at other times. There is a way to turn the button off, but no way to reconfigure it to something more useful. Nokia has added a 3.5mm headphone jack to the phone and a single speaker at the bottom. It has plenty of volume, but no bass, resulting in a harsh and tinny sound.On the back is a quad-sensor camera module that protrudes very slightly from the body and is set above a fingerprint sensor. The design is not dissimilar to many other phones from the last few years, including the OnePlus 7T and the Poco F2 Pro, and is attractive in an inoffensive way.This phone doesn’t look like it costs $199, and that’s the big takeaway here. You’re not getting an ugly phone that screams “cheap” when you pick it up or look at it, but rather an understated and well-balanced design. I suggest you buy the Nokia 5.3 in either the cyan or sand color, rather than the boring charcoal color of my review model, to give the phone a boost in appeal.The 6.5-inch IPS LCD screen on the front shows where money was saved. The resolution is 1,600 x 720 pixels, meaning it’ll play YouTube videos at a maximum of 720p, and while this is all perfectly acceptable for a phone at this price, I found it suffers from a lack of brightness. I had to crank the brightness up to full most of the time, and even then it’s difficult to see in bright sunlight. The auto brightness feature is annoyingly haphazard too, rarely settling on a single level before fluctuating again, and never to the right point.There’s a teardrop notch with the selfie camera at the top of the screen, and a small chin bezel with Nokia branding on the bottom. Provided the brightness is maxed out and the intrusive Night Light feature that reduces blue light is turned off (it messes with the colors too much, especially during scrolling), the screen is fine for everyday use. Just don’t expect it to be a media powerhouse.You can expect it to be satisfactory, though. The low resolution means detail is lacking, but I found the screen has a very cool color palette on default settings. It does cry out for more brightness, and some video can lack life and vibrance. However, this isn’t really what the phone is for, and the Nokia 5.3 is fine for casual viewing. I also like that the screen is massive, so you don’t feel like the low price has led to any other visual compromise outside of the resolution.Even phones that cost $199 have four lens camera sensors these days, but they shouldn’t. The Nokia 5.3’s main camera has 13-megapixels and an f/1.8 aperture, and is joined by a 5-megapixel ultra-wide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro lens. The selfie camera inside the teardrop notch has 8 megapixels.It’s functional, but not inspirational. Like the screen, expectations need to be tempered, as it’s inconsistent and rarely took a photo I’d want to share without editing. Neither the wide-angle or the standard lenses get the lighting right every time, either overexposing or underexposing a shot, and the dynamic range varies greatly between the two as well. Macro shots are as underwhelming as you’d expect from a 2-megapixel sensor.There is a Night mode, but the shots it takes are only marginally better than those taken without it, and a Portrait mode as well. Edge detection is decent, but you do have to wait around for the camera to process the shots. Flip to the selfie camera and the results often suffer from looking washed out in bright conditions, but indoors the results are acceptable.Couple all this with slow software, and the Nokia 5.3’s camera is a disappointment. This is a cheap phone, and it’ll never take on the very best when it comes to the camera, but there should still be a standard to maintain. Speedy software and consistent performance is needed at any price point. I’d rather have a single lens camera that takes good photos than a quad-lens camera taking mediocre photos.The Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor with either 3GB, 4GB, or 6GB of RAM powers the Nokia 5.3. My review phone has 4GB, and handles tasks like social networking apps, messaging, and calls without a problem. Do anything more intensive, which includes using YouTube, and speed can suffer. For example, switching from landscape to portrait orientation takes a few seconds to complete, and exiting power-hungry game apps results in a lengthy pause while the phone sorts itself out.The benchmark tests are as follows:Geekbench 5: 308 Single Core/1312 Multi Core3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 1129 (Vulkan)It’s the same chip used in the Motorola Moto G8, the Moto G Fast, and the G Power, and the results are similar. Think you won’t be able to game on the Nokia 5.3? Think again. No, it’s not an ROG Phone 2, but I played Asphalt 9 Legends happily enough. Sure, it’s not the smoothest experience, but it never devolves into a situation that makes it unplayable. Playing through 1945 and Hill Climb Racer was fine, too.The Nokia 5.3 is an Android One phone. This means the software is similar to the Google Pixel phones, with no special user interface, additional apps, or other alterations to Google’s basic Android style. Android One also ensures regular and timely software updates, and the phone will receive Android 11 when it arrives, plus be updated for the next two years in total. This is a serious selling point, and makes sure your cheap smartphone purchase won’t be out of date in the near future.It runs very smoothly apart from a few performance-related stutters, and I like that it has a Dark mode and comes with NFC for Google Pay as well. Again, this is another major advantage as some competing devices do not have this feature at all.The 4,000mAh battery, paired with the low-resolution screen and mid-level processor, gave me high hopes for the Nokia 5.3’s battery life. In reality, it wasn’t anything better than most other phones, regardless of specification. I’ve been testing the Nokia at home for the most part, and therefore it has spent most of its time connected to Wi-Fi.Average use for me includes social media, some photos, some video and voice calls, plus messages and a little gaming. The Nokia has lasted almost two full days, but only provided the second day is less intensive than the first. Video also puts additional strain on the battery. Charging is wired only, and there’s no fast charging here either.Security is exactly what you want: A simple yet secure fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone, and face unlock for convenience, both of which are fast and mostly reliable. However, the rear fingerprint sensor didn’t work well with wet fingers. It does have a handy feature where a swipe down on it will pull down the notification shade on the screen.The Nokia 5.3 can be purchased in the U.S. for $199 through Amazon. In the U.K., it costs 149 British pounds and is available from Nokia’s own online store, as well as through Amazon and Argos.Warranty in the U.K. is for two years for the device, but only one year in the U.S..There’s a danger when reading this review that you’ll think the Nokia 5.3 isn’t worth buying. I’ve pointed out its downsides, just as I do with any phone, but it’s important to put them into context. The Nokia 5.3 costs $199, it does everything you could want from a smartphone, and it even does some things quite well. You can find much better phones, but at the same time, the Nokia 5.3 can easily handle what most people need a phone to handle.It’s refreshing to find that $199 buys you an attractive, modern smartphone that plays top games, runs all your apps, and has enough power and battery to be a trusty everyday companion. Just be prepared for it not to excel in photography or display quality, like you would expect from a $700-plus model.For $199? The choices are slim. Take a look at the Motorola Moto G Power for $249 or the $199 Motorola Moto G Fast if you want similar alternatives. However, to truly buy a better phone, you’ll have to spend a lot more. We recommend the $399 Apple iPhone SE, the $500 Poco F2 Pro, or the $600 OnePlus 8. Google has discontinued the Pixel 3a, but if you can still find one, it’s a solid purchase.The Nokia 5.3 does not have water resistance, but the composite rear panel is scratchproof. HMD Global also promises software updates for the next two years, thanks to the Android One platform, and this is a significant benefit over the Motorola alternatives. Provided you don’t expect your own phone use to change, the Nokia 5.3 will last all of the two-year guaranteed software update period without a problem.Yes. Don’t get caught up in the negatives, and instead be happy that $199 buys you a capable everyday smartphone."
32,OnePlus 8,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-8-review/,"The $600 OnePlus 7T was an easy phone to recommend, but will history repeat itself with the OnePlus 8 Pro? You’re going to have to spend an additional $100 over last year’s phone to get one, as it now starts at $700. To justify an increase, the OnePlus 8 needs to step up its game considerably, as it will have to compete with a lot of other highly capable phones.My time spent with the OnePlus 8 shows it struggles to do so, because the addition of 5G simply isn’t widely available enough yet to be called a must-have.The OnePlus 8 looks almost identical to the OnePlus 8 Pro — just a little smaller, a bit thinner, and a bit lighter. This makes a big difference in terms of carrying the phone around and using it with one hand. Unlike choosing the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro over the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max, the screen size trade-off isn’t so major. The OnePlus 8’s 6.55-inch Fluid AMOLED screen never feels like a compromise compared to the 6.78-inch OnePlus 8 Pro’s.At 180 grams, the OnePlus 8 is light for a modern smartphone. I like the 20:9 aspect ratio paired with the 8mm thick body, because it allows me to stretch my thumb over the screen easily. The side buttons are also easier to reach and press on the OnePlus 8 than on the 8 Pro. There is a fingerprint sensor under the screen, and although it’s lightning quick, the face unlock had usually unlocked the screen before I got to it.I love the feel of the matte Gorilla Glass finish, which is cool to the touch and resists picking up too many fingerprints, yet still neatly catches the light — especially in the stunning green color pictured above. Yes, it’s green, but in different lighting conditions it becomes a wonderful aquamarine blue, as you can see in our photos below. The curved corners and low weight mean it sits comfortably in your palm. However, the edges of the body are still sharply tapered, so fatigue will set in when the phone is gripped tightly.On the back, the camera bump is not overly pronounced, and fewer sensors means it looks less cluttered too. The decision to use a punch-hole selfie camera instead of a complicated and heavy motorized selfie camera has a similar result on the front, keeping it neat and functional. The OnePlus 8 is sleek and chic, without unnecessary bulk, yet doesn’t ignore the need for a big screen. It’s just right.While the OnePlus 8 fares better than the OnePlus 8 Pro in design and size, the story isn’t so simple when we get to the technology inside, starting with the screen. The OnePlus 8 has a 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution Fluid AMOLED screen and a 90Hz refresh rate, but does without the motion-smoothing feature. Put them alongside each other and there is a subtle difference, with the OnePlus 8 Pro looking ever so slightly sharper, smoother, and more attractive.Yet it’s not like the OnePlus 8 looks bad — far from it. Play a 1080p, HDR10 film and it’s still excellent, while video is enjoyable and immersive. This is helped by the dual speakers and Dolby Atmos support. Worried about the missing motion-smoothing feature? Don’t be. While it’s sometimes effective at artificially reducing blur when watching video, the effect is not always desirable. I didn’t miss it. I experienced fewer touch -sensitivity problems on the OnePlus 8, too.The lower resolution means a lower pixel density. The 402 pixel-per-inch (PPI) rating on the OnePlus 8 is significantly lower than the OnePlus 8 Pro’s 513 PPI, the Galaxy S20 Plus’s 525 PPI, and the smaller iPhone 11 Pro’s 458 PPI. It’s not as stunning to look at as any of these phones, and consequently doesn’t qualify as high quality or premium. That’s where the OnePlus 8 Pro really excels, and where cost-cutting has affected the OnePlus 8. It’s good, but not a reason to buy, like it is on the OnePlus 8 Pro.I’m pleased to say the OnePlus 8’s software experience, which consists of its own OxygenOS 10.5 user interface built on Android 10, is identical to the OnePlus 8 Pro. It’s excellent, with a slick design, tons of speed, and only minor annoyances. I go into more detail in my review of the OnePlus 8 Pro.The cost-cutting continues with the camera. Gone is the new Sony IMX689 sensor headlining the OnePlus 8 Pro. In its place is the trusty IMX586 sensor we’ve seen many times before, with an f/1.75 aperture, optical and electronic image stabilization, and the ability to shoot 4K video at 60fps. It’s joined by a 16-megapixel wide-angle lens and a 2-megapixel macro camera.It takes very pleasant pictures, but it won’t astound with incredible, eye-popping images. My Gallery ended up with solid, dependably decent photos, but nothing I was especially proud of. The IMX586 needs good software tuning to get the most from it, and that’s where OnePlus is at the top of its game. The colors pop, the dynamic range is strong, and the HDR is effective. The portrait mode has good edge detection, but does take a few moments to capture its subject.Use the OnePlus 8’s camera to take regular, everyday shots, and you’ll be happy with the results. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is good, but not as good as the competition. The macro camera lacks color and definition, night mode isn’t great in very low light, and there’s no optical zoom feature. You don’t get the bizarre Color Filter lens on the OnePlus 8 Pro, which inverts the colors in your photos for a really odd look, but that’s not a bad thing.To wrap up, the OnePlus 8’s camera doesn’t stand out. There is no key special new feature, whether it’s a successful software-driven enhancement like Samsung’s Single Take mode or Apple’s excellent Deep Fusion technology, or something like 8K video recording or a periscope zoom like the Huawei P40 Pro.Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor drives the OnePlus 8. It has a 5G modem and a choice of either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. The chip and 5G modem are likely the main reason the phone’s price has gone up, but 5G remains unavailable in many places, meaning you’ll be paying more for something you can’t use. This will change over time; but for now it’s hard to recommend most people buy a 5G phone. I’ve been testing the 12GB version, and the benchmark results are as follows:The performance is equal to that of the OnePlus 8 Pro, and therefore beats the Galaxy S20 Plus and the Oppo Find X2 Pro, as well. Calls have been clear and reliable, although I have not been able to test out the 5G connection. I played a lot of the vertically scrolling shooter 1945, which has a high frame rate and takes advantage of the 90Hz screen refresh rate, and I enjoyed it a great deal. DariusBurst has to be played in a smaller window due to the 20:9 aspect ratio screen, but it doesn’t matter, as it’s still exciting to play. Gaming on the OnePlus 8 is similar to the experience on the Galaxy S20 Plus, with the right weight and in-hand comfort for extended play sessions.The battery inside the OnePlus 8 has a 4,300mAh capacity and is supported by Warp Charge 30T fast charging. It does not have wireless charging, unlike the OnePlus 8 Pro. Warp Charge wired charging is very fast, taking the battery to 50% in about 20 minutes, and on to full charge in a little over an hour in my tests.During this time of social distancing, the OnePlus 8 has spent most of its time connected to Wi-Fi, making video and voice calls, as well as being used for games, social networking, and video. It has easily lasted a full day even with heavy use. However, try this activity connected to a 5G network, and the battery will suffer. One feature I liked was new smart charge optimization, where the phone learns your charging routine and optimizes charging around it.Like many people, I put the phone on charge when I go to sleep and then unplug it in the morning. Even after a couple of days use, the OnePlus 8 took the battery to 80% in the first hour, then stopped charging it until an hour or so before I had been waking up. OnePlus says this will help the battery retain its charge for longer, so you can charge it with confidence. The optimization can be turned off if your daily hours are not set though.The battery, along with the software mentioned before, are two of the strongest reasons to buy the OnePlus 8.The OnePlus 8 seen here with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs $800, or $700 if you choose the 8GB/128GB version. In the U.K. the OnePlus 8 costs 600 British pounds for the 8GB/128GB model, and 700 pounds for the 12GB.256GB version. OnePlus provides a one-year warranty on its phones that covers manufacturing defects. It’s expected the OnePlus 8 will be available in April though the OnePlus website and carriers.The OnePlus 8 is a good smartphone. It has an attractive screen, a decent camera, great software, and long battery life. I love the design, the matte glass, and the green color. Still, it lacks any feature that makes it stand out. This did not matter on the OnePlus 7T because it cost just $600 — effectively making the price the standout feature. At $700 or $800 the OnePlus 8 does not have another feature to take its place. The OnePlus 8 has left the value segment and needs to step up its game.The increase in price means the $700/$800 OnePlus 8 is now battling with the $1,000 Samsung Galaxy S20, the $800 Google Pixel 4, and the $700 iPhone 11. All differentiate from the competition better than the OnePlus 8, which lacks a defining trait, despite being strong in most areas.You can pay less and get a good phone too. The $600 iPhone XR from last year is still a good buy, along with the $500 Asus Zenfone 6 too, and if you can find one, the approximately $450 Realme X2 Pro is still a startlingly good value.OnePlus has not given the OnePlus 8 an IP68 rating, so it’s splashproof and that’s all. The body is made from glass and therefore may break in the event of a fall. It’s best to put it in a case. OnePlus is good at delivering software updates, and there is plenty of power inside the phone, meaning it has two years use ahead of it at the very minimum. It’s great to have 5G on board too, which will keep it going for even longer.The increase of $100 over the OnePlus 7T may not sound like much, but 5G’s limited appeal isn’t really enough to justify the extra yet, so we don’t recommend buying the OnePlus 8 despite the fact it’s a decent modern smartphone. There are better choices available at both higher and lower prices."
33,OnePlus 8T,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-8t-review/,"The unassuming OnePlus 8 has been replaced by the OnePlus 8T. Wait, you don’t remember the OnePlus 8? That’s not surprising, as the phone was a safe, sensible choice that had absolutely no standout features, making it entirely forgettable. The OnePlus 8T also makes you forget, but this time it makes you forget about charging, because its big new feature completely removes any worry about making sure you have a fully charged phone each morning.Think that’s the whole story? It’s not, because the smartphone world around the OnePlus 8 has changed a lot since April, and has made the 8T’s life considerably harder than ever before.It’s all about change for the OnePlus 8T. Instead of the unusual central camera module on the back of the OnePlus 8, this time it’s an offset module that makes the phone look more like the Galaxy S20. I really like the look of the OnePlus 8T, and am impressed with the total lack of fingerprints left on the body, which keeps it looking clean and new.Like the OnePlus 8, the 8T has a flat screen on the front, with a slight curve around the edges. The aluminum chassis is very well designed, with a pronounced curve that leads from the flat screen into the cool, matte-finish Gorilla Glass rear panel. This neatly helps prevent any fatigue from holding the phone over a long period of time, as does the relatively low 188-gram weight and 8.4mm-thick body. It doesn’t dig into your palm, and is devoid of sharp edges.OnePlus isn’t trying too hard with the 8T’s design. It’s clean and simple, mature and attractive. While I appreciate visually unusual designs like the Oppo Reno4 Pro and the Vivo X50 Pro, they try a little too hard. The OnePlus 8T’s cool, unpretentious look will appeal to more people, and stay fresh for longer. The phone comes in two colors, the Lunar Silver seen here and a pretty Aquamarine Green.You get a 6.55-inch, 120Hz refresh rate Fluid AMOLED screen on the OnePlus 8T, with a 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution and a 20:9 aspect ratio. It’s hard to want anything else. Watch 60fps videos on YouTube and it’s glorious, so smooth and easy on your eyes, and with some stunning colors, too. The psychedelic colors in Iz*One’s Beware music video are hyper-real, and on the flip side, as demonstrated in Woyshnis Media’s Audi RS7 video, blacks, grays, and midtones look excellent as well.There are dual stereo speakers that have masses of volume but not much bass or finesse, and it’s better to keep the volume at sensible levels to avoid too much harshness. Listen to WJSN Chocome’s bouncy, high-note-heavy Hmph! and it sounds much better at half volume than it does at three-quarter volume. The phone also supports Dolby Atmos.Oddly, although the screen apparently has a 1,100-nit maximum brightness, I never felt the phone’s screen was that bright. It’s not dim at this level, but it was rare that the auto-brightness was less than about 80%, and during the day I still had it maxed out to watch video.The OnePlus 8T introduces Warp Charge 65T, a proprietary superfast charging technology that will stop you worrying about putting the phone on charge overnight. How? By taking the battery to around 60% charge in just 15 minutes. OnePlus says this is enough juice for a day’s use, so is it? Yes, although it will depend on your definition of a day’s worth of time.First, the fast charge time is accurate. Fifteen minutes is all it took for my OnePlus 8T’s battery to go from 3% to 60%. This means if you often forget to charge your phone, or if you’d rather minimize the amount of time it’s left plugged in and charging, the OnePlus 8T will happily fit into your lifestyle. To fully charge the battery from flat takes about 40 minutes.However, while it’s fast to charge, it’s also pretty fast to discharge. With a 60% charge, it ran from midday to 11:30 p.m. This was with about 20 minutes of video, 15 minutes of Asphalt 9 Legends, about 45 minutes of a WhatsApp video call, and then general use. If you classify a day’s worth of power as about 12 hours, then you should get that from the OnePlus 8T, provided you go easy on it.  Power-intensive tasks suck plenty of energy, video and gaming especially. An hour of video will generally reduce the battery by 12% to 15%, which would quickly affect the phone’s ability to last should you start the day with only 60%.Warp Charge 65T uses a special charging block and USB Type C cable to charge the dual-cell 4,500mAh battery inside the phone, so you do have to have it on hand. Cleverly, it charges each of the cells at 30W, which helps minimize wear and keep heat at a sensible level. The OnePlus 8T only gets a little warm during its fast charging. The phone does not support wireless charging.OnePlus’ fast-charging technology isn’t the first of its kind. We’ve seen it already on several phones from Oppo, and even on the budget Realme 7 Pro, but the OnePlus 8T is the first phone widely available in the U.S. to feature such fast-charging technology. That does make it special, and absolutely no one said that about the OnePlus 8.At first glance, the OnePlus 8T’s camera is rather mundane. An all-too-familiar IMX586 camera with 48-megapixels tops the list, followed by a 16MP ultrawide, and a 5MP macro camera. It’s the fourth lens that is different enough to make me sit up and take notice — that one is a dedicated monochrome lens that can be used on its own.Used primarily to enhance color photos, the OnePlus 8T’s stand-alone monochrome camera also takes genuine black-and-white photos without using a filter to get the desired effect. This was something I loved on Huawei’s cameras until it was removed, which upset me enough to write it an obituary. Sadly, it’s not a replacement for Huawei’s monochrome camera mode, as it only has 2MP, but I do like the atmospheric shots it takes.Otherwise, the OnePlus 8T continues on from the improvements we saw in the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro’s camera. The main and wide-angle cameras take pretty, colorful, and bright photos with good dynamic range, both outside and indoors. The variety of cameras gives it versatility, and I had fun taking photos, especially since I was confident in the results looking good.There isn’t an optical zoom option, although the app gives you a 2x mode, but the results are noisy and lack detail when you look closely. The Nightscape mode now works in video too, and it continues to be a subtle but effective night mode. It joins a video bokeh mode to blur the background when shooting video, which isn’t so good and won’t fool anyone into thinking it’s a real bokeh effect. The portrait effect in stills from the selfie camera and the rear camera is much better.The OnePlus 8T uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor and comes with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. This is the same as the OnePlus 8. It also has 5G connectivity, but because 5G is not available in my local area, this feature could not be tested. Calls made with the OnePlus 8T sound clear, and the speaker works well for hands-free calls too.OnePlus has become one of the first manufacturers to release a smartphone with software based on Android 11. There are some great features too. A press of the power button activates a shortcut screen with controls for your smart home, plus there’s Google Pay and a screenshot key too, as well as Google’s new screen recorder feature. OnePlus has improved its Dark Mode, and built OxygenOS 11 with one-handed use in mind.This translates into more open space at the top of the screen, and options being skewed lower down the screen, making them easier to locate. It’s most obvious browsing the top level of the Settings menu, and in OnePlus’ own Weather app. But it’s not everywhere, including OnePlus’ File Manager app, some of the deeper settings screens, or anything that’s basic Android, like the apps drawer.OxygenOS finally sees the introduction of an always-on screen. It seems odd that one of the very best manufacturer versions of Android hasn’t had this simple feature until now, but here we are, and astonishingly it’s still not quite ready. The feature that will make it different, called Canvas, is still to come in a software update. This will put an outline of your wallpaper onto the lock screen for a pleasingly seamless look when locking and unlocking. It’ll be joined with a Snapchat Bitmoji always-on screen too, and the update will arrive in November.For now, it’s very similar to most other always-on screens. It shows the time, battery percentage, and notification icons. There is another option, called Insight, that works alongside Digital Wellbeing to tell you how many times you’ve unlocked the phone and how long you’ve spent on it. It’s an option confusingly hidden under Clock Style rather than the ambient display setting, and is also confusing to look at. This aside, I’m very pleased to see an always-on screen option in OxygenOS.I played Asphalt 9 Legends and Hill Climb Racer without issue. There’s an improved game mode that’s less visually intrusive (it slides in from a top corner of the screen and takes up almost no space), with a handy split-screen option to quickly reply to messages. Using the OnePlus 8T with OxygenOS on a daily basis has been free from annoyances, with bulletproof reliability, plus a decent turn of speed. It’s also worth pointing out the pleasing haptic feedback.The OnePlus 8T will be available starting October 23, with pre-orders beginning on October 14 from OnePlus’s own online store. Amazon will also sell the OnePlus 8T beginning October 23. The phone will cost $749 for the 12GB/256GB model, and it does not appear the 8GB/128GB model will be sold in the U.S.. For reference, the 12GB/256GB OnePlus 8 cost $800.In the U.K., the Lunar Silver OnePlus 8T will be the 8GB/128GB phone and cost 549 British pounds, and the 12GB/256GB model will be available in Aquamarine Green for 649 British pounds.If you’re looking for a OnePlus 8T Pro, then don’t. The OnePlus 8 Pro will remain the company’s top smartphone for now, and the OnePlus 8T will only supersede the OnePlus 8, which was released in April.The superfast charging delivered by Warp Charge 65T gives the OnePlus 8T the standout feature that was lacking from the OnePlus 8, making it a better purchasing decision than its predecessor, but in the time since that phone went on sale, the midrange smartphone market has moved on significantly. At $749, the OnePlus 8T is too expensive, and now it’s much harder to justify paying the higher price for a top processor, when cheaper phones with a high-mid processor are just as capable for everyday use.If you live in the U.S., yes. The smartphone world has changed considerably since April when the OnePlus 8 stood not unchallenged, but certainly at the top of the pile. Now, we have the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and the Google Pixel 5, both of which are $50 cheaper than the OnePlus 8T and are arguably more compelling purchases.There are some outliers to consider as well, including the LG Velvet, the Motorola Edge, and the Nokia 8.3. All are good smartphones that may not have the OnePlus 8T’s very fast charging, but still have other tempting features ranging from design to stunning screens. If you want to save some money, the Google Pixel 4a 5G is $499, and comes with great software and. we expect, a good camera too.Then we come to OnePlus itself. In the U.K. the OnePlus Nord is cheaper and really just as good, and the more expensive OnePlus 8 Pro has additional desirable features — water resistance and wireless charging — that make it a better long-term proposition. However, the 8GB/128GB OnePlus 8T is better value at 549 British pounds than the 12GB/256GB version, and is a worthy alternative to the phones mentioned above. It doesn’t look like the cheaper phone will be sold in the U.S., which is unfortunate.The OnePlus 8T does not have an IP rating for water resistance, but is stated to be splash-proof for use in the rain. It’s not a tough phone as it’s made from glass, but you do get a transparent silicone case in the box. It has the latest version of Android installed now, and OnePlus will deliver major updates over the next two years, and security updates for the next three years. This, along with some careful care, should mean the phone will happily last for two years.No. Not because it’s a bad phone — it’s not, it’s very good. But you can pay less for equally capable smartphones from other big-name manufacturers."
34,OnePlus Nord,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-nord-review/,"OnePlus has always offered incredible value, but it has lost its way over the past year as prices crept up on its most desirable devices. Today’s OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro are solid phones, but they’re equivalent in price to competitors.The company’s latest release, the OnePlus Nord, feels like a return to the company’s roots. It’s a strong midrange phone that looks attractive and packs some high-end features. That’s the kind of value we want to see, but does it make the Nord a worthy purchase?It’s a good thing there’s a big OnePlus logo on the back of the Nord, as the phone shares a similar design to several other smartphones, from the Huawei P30 Pro to the Xiaomi Mi 9.In other words, the Nord isn’t instantly recognizable. It’s a tried-and-tested look, but far from unique. The Grey Onyx version in the accompanying photos is understated but attractive, while the Emerald Blue model is a real eye-catcher.Gorilla Glass covers both the front and rear, with a plastic frame between the two. It doesn’t look or feel like plastic, however, and its use contributes to the low 184 gram weight. You shouldn’t worry that the plastic frame will feel cheap, but the phone’s metal buttons lack the positive, premium action of those on the metal-and-glass OnePlus 8.OnePlus has included its trademark notification alert slider, where you can quickly change the mode from silent to ring or vibrate. The machined texture makes it easy to use. All the buttons are well-located, provided you use the phone with your right hand. The phone’s 73mm width and 8.2mm thickness mean it’s easy to grip and hold. It’s about the same size as a Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus.The phone doesn’t have a “wow, that’s a OnePlus Nord” design, but the ergonomics are spot-on, and it looks and arguably feels like phones that cost a lot more. It’s only when you pick up the Nord and a phone like the Galaxy S20 or OnePlus 8 that the differences become apparent — mostly in terms of added weight, and the chiseled-from-slate feel that comes with a metal chassis.Gorilla Glass 5 covers a 6.44-inch Fluid AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate, 2400 x 1080 pixel resolution, and 20:9 aspect ratio screen with HRD10+ support. That’s an excellent screen for a phone at this price. It’s a flat screen, which will please as many people as it upsets, but it does make the phone less likely to slip out of your hand. Some will consider it better for games, too.Turning to Carfection’s McLaren 600LT Spider review video on YouTube, the Nord’s screen struggles to show detail in some of the darker areas, but has a lovely color palette on the default Vivid screen setting. If you want to dig into the settings, you can activate the sRGB and Display P3 options, though the differences are minimal.Sound is played through a single, downward-facing speaker. It’s loud without becoming distorted, and while bass is obviously lacking, it’s tuned nicely and never becomes harsh. There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack, but like other OnePlus phones, the Nord supports both AptX and AptX HD. Provided you have a pair of compatible headphones, you can listen to high-resolution audio through the Nord’s Bluetooth connection.Bluetooth music played through Spotify to a pair of Bowers & Wilkins PX headphones has plenty of volume and depth. The Nord’s overall multimedia experience, when you take the price into consideration, is excellent.The main camera is a Sony IMX586 with 48-megapixels and an f/1.75 aperture, plus optical and electronic image stabilization. Alongside it is an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro sensor. It’s what you find on the OnePlus 8. On the front is a dual-lens selfie camera made up of a 32-megapixel main sensor and an 8-megapixel wide-angle sensor.Despite being similar to the OnePlus 8, the Nord’s camera isn’t as good. It underexposes shots frequently, and can’t use HDR as effectively, resulting in a loss of detail in difficult lighting conditions using both the wide-angle and standard lens. The macro lens is of low quality and rarely focuses well, making it mostly useless. Nightscape doesn’t do much better, and often introduces noise, or produces a drab photo.I felt the need to edit almost all the photos taken with the Nord before sharing them, as they just didn’t “pop” in the way I wanted. Overcast skies became oppressive and unnatural, and sunny day photos lacked dynamic range. I like the new filters created by photographer Hannes Becker, though.Portrait mode selfies have a strong, rather unnatural bokeh effect with only average edge detection, a problem that continues when using portrait mode on the rear camera.OnePlus demonstrated considerable improvement with the OnePlus 8 Pro’s camera, but has taken a step back with the Nord’s. It’s by no means terrible, but it’s not as good as I expect. There are better cameras on other phones, even at this price.Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor with either 8GB/128GB or 12GB/256GB of RAM and storage space comes inside the OnePlus Nord. I have been reviewing the 12GB version. It also has 5G support, if you live in an area where the service is available. Here are some benchmark test results:3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 2,985 (Vulkan)Geekbench 5: 1,900 Multi-Core/603 Single CoreIt’s the same chip found inside the LG Velvet and the Motorola Moto Edge. The Nord beats them both on the gaming-focused 3DMark test, but is broadly similar on Geekbench 5. Performance is good. There is some slight hesitation when switching between apps or from fullscreen video back to normal, but not to the point where the phone feels slow. It is also likely to be software-related, and cured in a future update. However, this does make me wonder if the 8GB/128GB model may feel a little underpowered.Playing Real Racing 3, Sky Wings, and Dariusburst didn’t reveal any problems with performance, as you’d expect from the games-focused G version of the Snapdragon 765, and the phone didn’t get hot even after extended sessions. There’s OnePlus’ Fnatic game mode onboard, which minimizes distractions and optimizes the processor.OnePlus’ OxygenOS is one of the best versions of Android available. It’s fast, smooth, and not packed out with pointless features or stylistic flourishes. It does the job it’s made for, and I didn’t have any problems with reliability.I still like Zen Mode, which gives you a time-out for 20 minutes by muting calls and notifications, and restricting app access. The slide-in Google News and Assistant panel is helpful, there are some pretty animated wallpapers, gesture control works faultlessly, and it does look and feel silky smooth. OnePlus says it has worked on OxygenOS’s fluidity, and it shows.The 4,415mAh battery lasts about two days before needing a recharge, based on about three hours of daily screen time, when mostly connected to Wi-Fi.There’s some interesting tech working behind the scenes inside the Nord, helping to protect the life span of the battery by intelligently charging it in stages overnight. It charges to around 80%, then waits until before the time you usually get up to add the final amount of charge. This avoids any problems with keeping the battery fully charged for long periods, which may reduce long-term capacity.It comes with Warp Charge 30T, which is OnePlus’s proprietary fast charging. It’s wired only on the Nord, and goes from zero to 70% in 30 minutes, and then on to full in a little over an hour. The phone is secured using an in-display fingerprint sensor that worked very reliably. Speed was such that I could happily use it without resorting to face unlock.I’ve had some Wi-Fi problems with my OnePlus Nord. I found the connection would sometimes hang and not switch to cellular, with the problem only resolved by turning the Wi-Fi on and off again. The range seems to be shorter than many other phones too. I have reported the issue to OnePlus and am submitting bug reports when the issue arises, something it thankfully does rarely. Calls have been fine. I do not have 5G in my local area, so have been unable to test performance.A few days before the review embargo was up, OnePlus delivered a software update to the Nord that may help cure the Wi-Fi connectivity issues, and improve the camera too. I’ll update this review should anything change.The OnePlus Nord costs 379 British pounds, which converts over to about $480 U.S., if you buy the 8GB/128GB model. The 12GB/256GB version I’ve reviewed here costs 469 British pounds, or about $593. The Nord is not officially for sale in the U.S. It’ll be available through OnePlus’ online store on August 4, in addition to John Lewis retail stores, Amazon, and the Three network.OnePlus does not intend to sell the Nord in the U.S., outside of a promised but very limited beta program, but does say it will make a U.S.-focused, reasonably priced phone in the future.OnePlus has increased the value of the Nord the old-fashioned way, increasing the phone’s longevity and concentrating on what matters on a day-to-day basis, rather than with attention-grabbing gimmicks. You’ll get reliable software, a great screen, long battery life, fast charging, 5G, and software updates for a few years.These are core features that cheap phones often shun in favor of headline-grabbing camera specs that can disappoint in the real world and a fancy design. These aren’t great reasons to buy a phone at this price, but the OnePlus Nord gets the value just right.The under-$500, or under 500 British pounds, smartphone space is quite crowded. The $400 Google Pixel 3a has been discontinued with no replacement yet, but it’s still a good buy if you can find one, or you can buy the cute $400 Apple iPhone SE 2020. It’s cute because it’s small, but the build and materials are superior to the Nord’s, and iOS is superbly designed and easy to use. It’s also worth looking at the $500 Poco F2 Pro, or the $400 Samsung Galaxy A51.These phones are in tight competition, so it’s hard to broadly recommend any of them for every buyer. The Nord is the best pick if you care most about performance and display quality, and don’t care much about photography.You’ll pay a little more for the $600 LG Velvet and the $500 Moto Edge, but both are good phones with more attractive designs and better cameras. If you can stretch the budget a little more, then do consider the $700 OnePlus 8, which has a classier design and a better camera, or a $700 iPhone 11 with its great software, camera, and performance.While the OnePlus 8 Pro was given an IP rating, don’t expect one on the Nord. The phone is not water resistant, but will be fine for using in the rain. The body is made from glass and may break if you drop it, so it’s best to use a case. OnePlus has a range of cases for the Nord, some with its signature “sandpaper” finish for extra grip.OnePlus promises two years of Android updates and three years of security updates. This is an excellent commitment, and one that increases the Nord’s long-term prospects, especially with 5G on board. Combine this with the battery-saving technology, and the Nord will last you for several years, and that’s superb for such a reasonably priced phone.Yes. The Nord is a budget phone you can buy without worrying that it’ll need to be replaced next year."
35,OnePlus Nord N10 5G,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-nord-10-5g-review/,"OnePlus has long been the bastion of value-for-money in the Android world, but as its flagship phones creep up in price, more room has been made for lower-cost devices that still offer some great features. The original OnePlus Nord exemplified this, with a solid design and good battery life. Now, OnePlus is expanding the series — with the new OnePlus Nord N10 5G.The new device is currently only available in Europe and the U.K., however OnePlus says that it will be bringing it, along with the also-new OnePlus Nord N100, to North America soon. At 329 British pounds it’s still not a cheap phone, but definitely budget conscious. Should you buy it? We put the OnePlus Nord N10 5G to the test to find out.Editor’s Note: Because the Nord N10 5G is available in Europe first, we were sent a European model to test. Testing in the U.S., the phone has technical limitations around 5G bands and other network technology. The North American model should not run into any of these issues.Midrange phones have been getting a whole lot better, and many of the best midrange devices now offer a modern design with an edge to edge display. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G is no exception to that rule. The display has nicely rounded corners, there’s a (relatively large) hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera on the top left of the display, and so on. The only thing that breaks the illusion is a large chin at the bottom of the display, but it’s certainly not a dealbreaker.The back of the phone looks very similar to other modern OnePlus devices. There’s a squircle-shaped camera module on the top left of the back of the phone, which houses the quad-lens camera. The only difference, at least in appearance, is the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, which generally worked well.Of course, appearance and feel are a little different. The back of the phone looks nice, but it’s built from plastic, and that can be felt. It’s common in phones in this price range, but I would still like to see midrange phones starting to get built from more premium materials.The phone looks nice, but appearance and feel are different — you know it’s plastic.Around the edges, you’ll get all the usuals: A USB-C port, a volume rocker, and a power button.  Also on the bottom is a strange hole. After consulting the instructions, I determined that it’s called a “headphone jack.” Weird.The Nord N10 5G offers a 6.49-inch display with a 1080p resolution and it looks good. No, it’s not a high-end 1440p display, but at least it’s a 90Hz high refresh rate display. It gets bright enough to use even in direct sunlight, it offers relatively vivid colors, and for most, it’s more than good enough.The OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers a Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 processor, coupled with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It’s not a bad lineup of specs, and in fact, it’s really nice that the base model comes with 128GB of storage. But there are other phones that feel snappier in the price range. A perfect example of that is the Google Pixel 4a, which is about the same price, and has a Snapdragon 730G — and the higher-end Pixel 4a 5G, which is admittedly a little pricier, has a Snapdragon 765G. While the standard Pixel 4a won’t beat the OnePlus Nord 10 5G in benchmarks, Google’s phones are very responsive in real-world use and more up to date with software.The limitations of the phone’s performance can be felt at times. Sometimes it takes a second or two to load the keyboard, and sometimes when you type, it can skip a beat to actually show the character on the display. Basic operation is relatively smooth most of the time, but it’s the occasions that it’s not smooth that you are reminded you have a budget device.Benchmark results confirm this. The Nord N10 5G got 281,214 in AnTuTu and 606 single-core, 1,804 multi-core in GeekBench 5. Gaming with the phone is a decent experience. Games take a beat to load, but actual gameplay worked fine in our testing with games like Call of Duty: Mobile and Asphalt 9.The battery on the phone sits in at 4,300mAh, and it was easily able to deliver a full day of use. That said, I recommend disabling the always-on display on the phone. The OnePlus Nord 10 5G has an LCD panel, and with the display feature enabled, the backlight stays on even when the display is “off.” That can seriously suck battery, and with the feature switched on, I did find that battery was impacted, to the point where I needed to charge the phone before the end of a moderate-use day.Full-day battery isn’t a problem, and Warp Charge 30T fast charging is a differentiator at this price.Thankfully, the phone supports OnePlus’ Warp Charge 30T, and it comes with a charger in the box. Since I was shipped the European model of the device, I didn’t test the charger here in the U.S. — however, having tested OnePlus fast charging in the past, it’s likely that the phone will be able to get a majority of its charge back in a matter of around 30 minutes. That’s a differentiator at this price.The Nord 10 5G also, as the name suggests, supports 5G, thanks to Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 690 chipset and Snapdragon X51 modem. The result is that you’ll get Sub-6 5G connectivity, but not the superfast mmWave that carriers like Verizon have been touting. That shouldn’t be a big deal for most though — mmWave is barely available, and you really shouldn’t buy or avoid a phone based on mmWave support.The OnePlus Nord 10 5G offers a quad-lens camera system, but it’s not necessarily as versatile as you might assume. While you would think that among those four lenses there’s a telephoto lens, there unfortunately is not. Instead, you’ll get a 64-megapixel main sensor, an 8MP ultrawide camera, a 5MP depth sensor, and a 2MP macro lens. I really wish OnePlus would do away with the macro lens — it’s useless.The cameras are fine, but not groundbreaking. This is where the Pixel 4a stands out.Photos are fine, but not groundbreaking. If you want the best photos on a phone in this price range, you’re better off turning to the Pixel 4a, which has flagship-level image processing.In general, the phone didn’t deliver as much detail as I would have liked to see. Colors were also a little muted, and not as vibrant as I would normally expect from a 2020 phone. That’s especially true in tricker shooting situations, for example with a bright background and darker foreground. Making sure HDR is on does help in those situations, but it doesn’t completely solve the issue.The OnePlus Nord 10 5G comes with OnePlus’ OxygenOS 10.5, and it’s a little frustrating to see that it doesn’t come with the latest OxygenOS 11 based on Android 11. That newer software is widely available already, and just sets the Nord N10 5G up for frustration when it comes to longer-term software support. That said, the overall experience of using any modern OnePlus phone is still good, and the OxygenOS Android customization is still simple and easy to navigate.You’ll get a few extra features too. For example, the phone comes with OnePlus’ Zen mode, which allows you to restrict your own access to your phone for a limited amount of time. Other features include the App Locker, which lets you hide apps behind the fingerprint sensor or a PIN code. Basic theming options make it simple to customize the look of the phone, and OnePlus is particularly good at keeping duplicate apps and bloat to a minimum.The OnePlus Nord 10 5G is available in Europe and the U.K. for 329 British pounds, which directly translates to about $430 — though I would guess the U.S. price will end up under $400. Eventually, the device will be released in the U.S., however we don’t have a date for it just yet.The device comes with OnePlus’ standard 12-month limited warranty, which pretty much just covers manufacturer defects.The OnePlus Nord 10 5G is a nice phone. It looks good, despite the plastic build, and performs fine, aside from a few instances where performance is a little lackluster. But the main selling point when it comes to the Nord 10 5G versus the competition seems to be its 5G support. And if you’ve read anything we’ve been writing over the past few years, you’ll know that you shouldn’t really buy a phone because it supports 5G.Still, with on-par performance for the money, a solid display, simple software, and good battery life, if you’re a OnePlus fan that wants a phone in this lower price range, it’s a great option.If you’re willing to give up 5G support (and really, that’s not a huge loss), then it’s worth getting the Google Pixel 4a instead of the OnePlus Nord 10 5G. The Pixel 4a offers a better camera, and an even more simplified software experience, though it comes at a slightly-higher 350 British pounds.If you really want 5G support, and can afford to spend a little more, the Pixel 4a 5G is the way to go, though it’s perhaps a full price-bracket higher at 499 British pounds. If you’re feeling really adventurous, it’s worth considering the iPhone SE, which offers better performance than any phone we’ve mentioned and a solid camera, though the design is a little dated.If you live in the U.K., or somewhere else the OnePlus Nord is available, do consider that before the N10. In the U.K. it’s 379 British pounds, and is a considerably more technically impressive phone for only a small amount extra.The OnePlus Nord 10 5G should last a solid two years, though expect it to really slow down by that time. That said, the phone doesn’t have an official water-resistance rating, so to get it to two years, you’ll need to be careful with it.No. You should spend a little extra consider the Google Pixel 4a instead."
36,Oppo Find X2,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oppo-find-x2-pro-review/,"How do you follow the Oppo Find X? It was ahead of its time in design, gave us an innovative and unusual motorized camera, and even had a completely insane Lamborghini version. It seems Oppo itself wasn’t quite sure what to do, as it has taken 20 months for the company to come up with a sequel.Meet the Oppo Find X2 Pro, a phone that’s not as outwardly flashy as the Find X, but is even more capable.I spent a few weeks with a prerelease phone at launch,then another week five months later with a final production model. It continues to impress me more than any Oppo phone before it. That’s thanks to advancements in the software and design. While it’s not perfect, it’s the first Oppo phone I feel confident recommending. Here’s why.Updated on September 18, 2020: Revised the software section, commented more on the black ceramic model, and added other alternative purchase options.Oppo’s decision to make the Find X2 Pro more conventional is the right one. I miss the madness of the Find X and other Find series phones just as much as the next tech fan, but they weren’t always practical. The Find X2 looks normal, perhaps to the point of feeling derivative from the front. However, the orange vegan leather back panel and gold accents prove Oppo’s design department still knows how to party.The beautifully curved 6.7-inch OLED screen cascades down the sides, but not to the extent you see on the Huawei Mate 30 Pro. It’s a subtler, shallower drop that still gives an immersive viewing experience. Oppo’s Light Effects notifications use the curved glass to alert you, displaying colored light when you get a call or new message. It catches your eye, keeps you informed, and looks cool.A gold aluminum chassis is sandwiched between the front glass and the vegan leather back. It’s smooth and gently curved so it doesn’t dig into your palm, while the leather back is warm to the touch. The Oppo Find X2 Pro is a joy to hold.The leather doesn’t have a heavy grain, and only the slightest texture, but it’s grippy. The phone never feels like it’s about to slip out of your hand. Whether the gold and orange color scheme appeals will be down to personal choice. Personally, I love the orange leather, but dislike the chintzy gold, and the Oppo badge looks like an afterthought.There’s a black ceramic model available if it’s too gaudy, and its this version I used after release. The back has a subtle texture to it and its far more grippy than I thought ceramic would be. It’s highly reflective but isn’t a fingerprint magnet, and in my opinion looks very classy and expensive.The leather model is slightly thicker and heavier than the black ceramic Find X2 Pro. At 9.5mm thick and 200 grams it’s quite a large phone, especially when compared to the featherweight, 186 gram, 7.8mm-thick Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus. It’s still pocketable, and never feels unwieldy, but is slightly top-heavy. The design, premium materials and build, and excellent in-hand comfort makes the Find X2 a mature and desirable phone.Oppo has put a lot of technology into the Find X2 Pro’s screen, and it really pays off. The 6.7-inch OLED has a 120Hz refresh rate, 3168 x 1440 resolution, 240Hz touch sampling, 10-bit color, and HDR10+ support, plus something called the O1 Ultra Vision Engine to optimize video performance. With it, the Oppo Find X2 strongly competes with the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and the Apple iPhone 11 Pro, two mighty phones with stunning screens.The Find X2 has plenty of options to alter the look of the screen, including adjusting the color temperature and the color mode, plus the chance to turn off the O1 Ultra Vision Engine if you don’t like the motion smoothing or HDR upscaling effect. With the color temperature set to default, the O1 Ultra Vision Engine on, and the color mode on Vivid, there is little to differentiate it from the S20 Plus when directly compared. Blacks are deep, shadows look perfect, colors are vibrant and strong, and detail is sharp. It’s a stunning screen out of the box, with plenty of adjustments available if you want them.You’ll find dual stereo, full-range speakers on the Find X2 Pro, which is also equipped with Dolby Atmos support. The speakers have plenty of volume, and Atmos adds an extra dimension too, but the phone does lack bass and can sound harsh when you crank the volume up.During the first few days of use, I was concerned the screen was a little unresponsive, which was at odds with the 240Hz touch sampling feature. My early review model had a screen protector attached that was lifting at one corner, and the feel of lag was removed with it. I didn’t experience any of those responsiveness problems on the second, final production phone I used, but did notice edge recognition issues when tapping buttons set in the bottom and top corners of the phone.I should also mention the phone’s haptic feedback, which is wonderfully soft and tactile, and very close to the superb vibrations of the OnePlus 8 Pro.The oversize camera bump on the back of the Find X2 Pro, resplendent in gold trim, has a 48-megapixel Sony IMX689 1/1.4-inch main sensor with an f/1.7 aperture, a second 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 ultra-wide sensor, and a 13-megapixel telephoto lens for a 2x optical zoom, plus a 5x and 10x hybrid setting and up to 60x digital. There’s dual optical image stabilization, Live HDR for video, and a macro mode, plus laser and phase detection autofocus.The camera app will look familiar if you’ve used a Huawei phone recently. From the zoom controls to the menu selector, the app’s layout is strikingly similar. I took photos before and after a key software update and liked many images from both. The camera takes colorful and detailed photos that edge toward a cooler palette than a Samsung camera. It can miss out on the atmospherics generated by phones like the Huawei P40 Pro, as well.There’s a noticeable difference in dynamics between the standard 48-megapixel lens (Sony’s new IMX689 sensor) and the wide-angle IMX586, which tones down colors. That said, when you activate Oppo’s “Dazzle” color mode, which uses artificial intelligence to enhance your images, it ups the saturation level to compensate. Edge detection using Portrait mode is average and sometimes struggled to recognize even the simplest of shapes, but the large sensor produces decent natural bokeh when an object is nearby.On the front is a 32-megapixel selfie camera in a small hole-punch, which comes with both a beauty mode and a night mode. This unusual addition to the selfie camera is surprisingly effective and reduces noise well in low light, but the processing time is long. However, I can see it being useful for many people. Otherwise, the selfie camera comes with plenty of filters and a decent portrait mode too.The Oppo Find X2 Pro’s camera is excellent. It’s versatile, with a great zoom and plenty of neat features, and produces strong photo results whether you’re using the front or rear cameras. It’s reliable and capable.Software is a traditional weakness of Oppo phones, and previous versions of ColorOS (the company’s Android user interface) were filled with frustrating alterations to normal Android features.Luckily, Oppo has changed course. The Oppo Find X2 Pro comes with ColorOS 7.1 over Android 10. It’s more modern, with a far better use of clean space to improve usability. The interface is refined to resemble Android on a Google Pixel 4 phone, in that menus and icons look consistent and are found in the places you expect. It’s also fast and smooth, thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate screen.The importance of this cannot be emphasized enough. Using the Find X2 Pro every day becomes a pleasure rather than a chore, because almost regardless of what phone you’ve come from, there’s no steep learning curve involved after switching. The always-on screen is helpful and shows notification icons neatly. I also like the systemwide dark mode.It’s not all good news, and the issues I had with the Oppo Reno 3 Pro are present, such as the useless Smart Assistant you swipe in from the Home screen. However, since Oppo has fixed other issues, these are now disappointments in an otherwise solid interface.A Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor and X55 5G modem are inside the phone, along with 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space. Running it through two benchmark tests returned these results.3DMark: 6,523 (Vulkan)Geekbench 5: 901 Single-core/3266 Multi-coreThis is the fastest Qualcomm processor available, and it’s matched with a huge chunk of RAM, so the Find X2 Pro never lacks performance. The results put it ahead in tests against the Exynos-powered Galaxy S20 Plus, as well as phones with the Snapdragon 855 Plus, like the Asus ROG Phone 2.On the early version of the phone I tested, calls were a problem. While reception was strong according to the icon and technically didn’t drop out, I often had trouble hearing the caller, and vice versa. It was intermittent, so not every call was affected, suggesting it’s a software problem. Sure enough, on the final production model, which has received several software updates since I last used it, call quality has been good and reception strong.The Find X2 Pro has an in-display fingerprint sensor and face unlock, both of which work very well, with the face recognition usually beating the fingerprint sensor in speed. A 4,260mAh battery, which is actually two 2,130mAh cells working together, provides the juice. This setup is instrumental in making Oppo’s SuperVOOC Flash Charge 2.0 fast charging system work, and in keeping temperatures down.Using the included 65W wired charger, the battery is charged up at a furious rate. In just 30 minutes, it shot from 0 to 100% in my repeated tests, which essentially makes overnight charging unnecessary. Put the phone on charge when you’re getting ready in the morning, and it’ll be finished before you are. Sadly, there’s no wireless charging and over the past five months I have relied on this system more, so missed it using the ceramic Find X2 Pro.Battery life is excellent. Using the final production model for a week with varied everyday use it has never dipped below 30% at the end of the day, and with moderate use it would likely last two days. Increased reliance on video calls recently has stopped this from happening now, but even with a few hours of WhatsApp video calls, the Find X2 Pro has never needed a top-up to last from around 8 a.m. to 1 a.m.The Oppo Find X2 Pro costs 1,100 British pounds (about $1,400 U.S.), and can be found on Amazon.com in the U.S., although not officially. In the U.K. the phone is available through Vodafone, EE, and O2, along with other online retailers. If you want to import to the U.S. Clove Technology will sell you one for $1,453. Oppo puts a two-year warranty on the device and the battery.The Find X2 Pro is Oppo at its very best. It has all the performance we expect from a flagship phone, without the impractical flashiness of past Find models, yet still enough individuality to appeal. The screen’s stunning, the camera is excellent, and the software has improved greatly over old models.All this comes at a high price that puts Oppo in the same space as Samsung, Apple, and Huawei. That’s deservedly so, but it remains to be seen if Oppo has the brand name recognition to attract at this level.Yes, mostly because Oppo has priced the Find X2 Pro quite high, and you can save some money by going for three extremely well-regarded smartphones instead. The $1,000 Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus is a strong alternative with very good software, a great camera, and one of the very best screens available. However, the design is dull compared to the Find X2 Pro.The $900 OnePlus 8 Pro is great value, and although the camera is not as versatile, the software experience is superb, plus it has both fast and wireless charging. If you aren’t fixed on buying an Android phone, the $1,000 Apple iPhone 11 Pro is our top pick for the year so far, even though a replacement is due in the near future.With an IP68 water-resistance rating, the phone will stay relatively safe in the event of getting wet, plus the leather-backed version should remain attractive for longer since it won’t show fingerprints or be at risk from breaking like a glass rear panel. Ceramic is tougher and more scratch-resistant than glass as well if you opt for the black version.Oppo’s track record with Android updates is not great in the past, but there’s good news on the Find X2 Pro. Oppo has announced ColorOS 11, which is built on Android 11, and said it will come to the Find X2 Pro in December 2020.Yes. The stunning screen, excellent photo capabilities, fast charging, and 5G for future-proofing, mean the Find X2 Pro will serve you well every day for several years."
37,Pixel 4a,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-4a-review/,"There’s a good chance you already know the Google Pixel 4a is cheap at $350, that the Android software is often upgraded and easy to use, and that the little phone is a solid enough everyday companion. You’ve probably also heard the camera is good too, but are you aware exactly how good it is?It’s so good that it’s really the only reason you should consider buying the Pixel 4a. Because here’s something else you may not know about the Pixel 4a: It’s a bit dull otherwise. I’ll explain.The Google Pixel 4a’s camera is staggering to the point of disbelief in terms of its ability, and it embarrasses cameras on phones that cost two or even three times what the Pixel 4a costs. There’s just one 12.2-megapixel camera on the back of the Pixel 4a. It’s a no-nonsense sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), and that’s about it. There’s no wide-angle mode, no optical telephoto mode (although it will digitally zoom in by cropping the image), and no fancy features like 8K video recording. Instead, it has Google’s computational photography expertise behind it, and that makes all the difference to its ability.This isn’t a new formula either, as the Google Pixel 4, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 3 all have great cameras for the same reason: Software prowess rather than hardware muscle. While the lack of flashy extras and multiple lenses does slightly limit the camera’s versatility, you can’t have everything for $349 — and what you do get will be plenty for anyone without an unlimited budget to spend on a smartphone.Colors are wonderfully natural, exposure is spot-on, and the dynamic range is always perfectly judged. Each photo you take will come out the way you want it to, without the need to edit, in almost all environments. The portrait mode has better edge detection than cameras with multiple sensors, and the Night Sight mode is incredible, perfectly managing brightness and contrast for natural color balance in dark scenes. Removing concerns about the end result increases your creativity, and your confidence.Close-ups are shockingly good, too. The pictures of the Nodus Sector watch taken at 2x zoom show masses of detail, and even at full 7x digital zoom, the photo isn’t ruined by noise or pixelation. The Pixel 4 has been my go-to for close-up watch photos for a while — the close-ups in the G-Shock Frogman review were taken with the Pixel 4.When I wrote my hands-on report of the Asus ZenFone 7 Pro, I was in the middle of moving, and my camera equipment was already stuffed inside a box. I needed to photograph the phone, so I used the Pixel 4a. The results are, in my opinion, excellent and only needed a few tweaks before being used in the article. It’s not that the photos were good that surprises — it’s the confidence I had in the Pixel 4a’s ability to just grab it and take the pictures. I didn’t feel the need to find my primary camera, when I knew the Pixel 4a would handle the task without requiring extra editing attention. I simply wouldn’t have the same confidence in many other phones, at any price.It’s not just the photos either — the app and controls are excellent. Tap to focus and the camera maintains the focus as you adjust position. What’s really great is that it shows you it’s doing this on the screen with a moving focal marker. It’s a little thing, but it gives you confidence the photo you take will appear how you want it to. There’s easy adjustment and locking of the brightness and exposure, and a handy horizon meter that gives a subtle haptic alert when it’s level. It’s all just so polished, fast, simple, and unbelievably capable.Remember, I’ve just described a single-lens camera on the back of a $349 smartphone. Whatever you’ve heard about the Pixel 4a’s camera, it’s all that and a bit more. It’s the major, and for many people. the only, reason you to buy the phone.The Pixel 4a’s camera makes me go wobbly at the knees, but the design and materials used make my eyes roll. It’s like the entire design budget was used up on making the power button a slightly minty green color, because the rest is cheap-smartphone-circa-2015 level of snooze-dom. You can argue that it doesn’t matter because the camera is so good, but it’s not true — the hasty that’ll-do approach seemingly taken here makes me not want to use the phone for very long. I’ll concede it’s better-looking than the Pixel 3a from the front, thanks to its much smaller bezels, but this is hardly glowing praise.Black plastic is the most basic material Google could have chosen, and it’s as dreary as it sounds. The texture provides some grip, but it has a tendency to get greasy and look ugly. The fingerprint sensor on the back is functional but very 2016, while it looks to me like the camera sensor and flash have been put in the wrong holes in the boring square module. The buttons on the side only succeed in feeling even cheaper than the black plastic casing.When you get the Pixel 4a out of your pocket or put it down on the table, you won’t feel any emotion at all. It’s the unbranded plastic carrier bag of the smartphone world. It’s the reminder that this is, indeed, a $349 phone.Outside of the superb camera and dull design, everything else about the Pixel 4a ticks the box marked “fine.” It’s acceptable in the way that it all works, but never dazzles. The 5.8-inch OLED screen is a good size and, on paper, the 2340 x 1080 pixel resolution is great for the price, but in reality it can be a little drab and doesn’t get bright enough. I don’t recall having the brightness below maximum at any time, and in bright sunlight or overcast conditions, it’s still not very legible.Much is made about Google’s version of Android on the Pixel phones, and it is well-organized and inoffensive on the eyes, but it’s really the three years of guaranteed future software updates that appeal rather than any flourish in the operating system. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor with 6GB of RAM is, well, fine, but that’s all. The benchmark results show how the phone is acceptable for everyday use, whether it’s used for gaming or browsing:3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 2276 (Vulkan)Geekbench 5: 1648 Multi Core/551 Single CoreThe one area where it does manage to elevate itself to “good” status is the battery. I get two days from it with moderate general use, although it doesn’t react well to extended video calls or other power-intensive actions. Charging takes nearly a leisurely 1 hour and 45 minutes, but we can’t expect much else when the phone is cheap. Google’s clever software does a good job of managing apps that demand power, so they don’t cause too many problems.The Google Pixel 4a costs $349 U.S., or 349 British pounds, and is available through Google’s own online store and from Amazon, plus a selection of carriers. These include Verizon and AT&T in the U.S., and Vodafone in the U.K..If you aren’t that worried about taking fantastic photos and just want a cheap smartphone, the Nokia 5.3 is just $200 with a larger screen, Android One software with regular updates, and a slightly more interesting design. If you want a phone that looks better and still has a good camera, the $399 Apple iPhone SE 2020 is a great purchase.Buy the Pixel 4a for the camera. It’s genuinely unbelievable how capable it is, for any price, and the photos it takes are stunning. Just be aware the rest of the phone, software aside, is desperately ordinary."
38,Pixel 5,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-5-review/,"I’m all for getting rid of gimmicks on smartphones, first to reduce the price and second because not everyone uses these “features” very often. That’s why I was pretty excited about the Pixel 5, which concentrates on the camera, battery life, software, and most importantly this year, the price.I’ve been using the Pixel 5 for a little while, and frustratingly, Google has gone a little too far in its normalization efforts. Gone are the quirks that made some warm to old Pixels, and while the camera is still a winner, it hasn’t moved the game forward in the way the Pixel 4 did. I’m getting a bit ahead of myself here, so let’s go into detail.Google has never been one for giving the Pixel a wild design, but it is very good at making a sensibly sized phone, and the Pixel 5 is exactly right. The metal body is welcome, as it’s warm to the touch, doesn’t get covered in fingerprints, and should be durable too. The nicely rounded sides make it easy to grip and hold, and the overall size and 8mm thickness — similar to other well-proportioned phones like the iPhone 11 Pro — is just right. It’s also astonishingly light at just 151 grams.All this makes it very easy to live with, and the Pixel 5 will appeal to anyone who finds many phones released recently too large to hold. Most competing Android phones are much bigger, and it’s only the iPhone 11 Pro that comes close to the Pixel 5’s perfectly judged dimensions. By stripping away some of the quirky features seen on previous Pixel phones, Google has settled on a phone that’s sized just right. And with a slightly larger screen than on the Pixel 4, you never feel shortchanged when watching video or playing games.However, it’s impossible to get excited about the Pixel 5’s looks, especially if you buy the black one. It’s understated to the point of invisibility, and doesn’t really have that all-important premium air about it. The fingerprint sensor is a good example of this. It’s on the back rather than under the screen, and therefore works really well, but it also ages the device’s design. Annoyingly, it isn’t complemented by a secure face unlock system like on the Pixel 4. There’s actually no face unlock at all.The side buttons are made of metal, but have the same clicky feel as the plastic ones on the Pixel 4a, which costs almost half the price. That’s great for the Pixel 4a, but not so good for the Pixel 5. There really isn’t much more to say about the design, which is a major indication that Google’s simplification efforts have gone too far. Without a fun experimental Google feature on board, like the Pixel 4’s squeezable sides, the Pixel 5 on the surface is a bit dull. It’s best to seek out the Sorta Sage (aka green) color, which does inject some character into the phone.The 6-inch OLED screen has a 90Hz refresh rate and a 2340 x 1080 resolution, is covered in Gorilla Glass 6, and supports HDR10+. It’s bigger than the Pixel 4 and 4a’s screens, but not as big as the Pixel 4 XL or 4a 5G’s. Google’s decision to remove the sensors required for Soli gesture controls and the infrared face unlock means the large bezels on the Pixel 4 have disappeared, resulting in minimal bezels of a uniform size on the Pixel 5. The selfie camera lives in a hole-punch cutout.If you’ve never used a phone with a 90Hz refresh rate before, you’re in for a treat. It’s definitely easier on the eyes compared to a phone with a 60Hz screen, resulting in less fatigue, And combined with Android 11’s smoothness, it makes scrolling through Twitter, Chrome, and other apps very pleasurable.It’s a beauty, too. It’s bright and detailed, but cooler than the Galaxy S20 FE, and with less saturation. Carfection’s Aston Martin Vantage Roadster review highlights these differences, with the silver car looking considerably more silver on the Pixel than on the Samsung phone, while the blue sky is more pronounced on the Galaxy phone. It’s a similar story when comparing it with the OnePlus 8T, but put the Pixel 5 against the cheaper Pixel 4a, and the performance is almost indistinguishable.The speakers are decent, but they lack a bit in both volume and bass, and can’t match the OnePlus 8T and Galaxy S20 FE’s more rounded, deeper sound. The takeaway here is that although attractive, the Pixel 5’s screen isn’t any better than the competition, and because the speakers are a little wimpy, the OnePlus 8T and Galaxy S20 FEprovide a better video-watching experience.The primary camera on the Pixel 5 is the same 12.2-megapixel, f/1.7-aperture camera with Phase Detection Autofocus (PDAF) and optical image stabilization (OIS) that you’ll find on the Pixel 4a and the Pixel 4. A second 16MP f/2.2 aperture wide-angle camera joins it on the Pixel 5, and it can also be found on the Pixel 4a 5G, but the Pixel 5 does not have the telephoto camera of the Pixel 4 — a switch Pixel fans were asking for last year.The physical cameras are only part of the story, and it’s really Google’s computational photography that’s the star. Google says the software has been given a serious upgrade for the new phone, and that makes up for using the same sensor as before. There are a few new features, including Night Sight portrait shots and new editing features for portrait shots.Let’s talk about this first, because it’s a good demonstration of Google’s software prowess. Portrait shots can be edited extensively, with the ability to adjust the background blur, remove the background color, and turn the entire image black-and-white. This is done at the tap of a button, and you can get deeper into editing the blur, depth, and color, too. All this works whether you’re taking portraits with the rear or the front camera, and there’s a special mode to adjust the light source with Portrait selfies. See above for examples of what’s possible. It’s really fun, very effective, and quite simple to use the feature.That sums up the Pixel 5’s camera very well in general. It really is a great point-and-shoot, because you’re assured that no matter the environment or conditions, it’ll take a cracking photo. That simplicity and ability is addictive, and it’s fun to go out and take lots of pictures, just to see what you can get. The wide-angle adds versatility and opportunity for dramatic shots, but some will miss the telephoto. Google’s not willing to please everyone by including both, sadly.The Pixel 5’s camera is brilliant, but it isn’t really a big generational leap over the Pixel 4, and not only does the much cheaper Pixel 4a take basically the same great photos, but the competition has caught up with Google on the software side. Samsung’s cameras are consistent these days, but it’s the camera on the Apple iPhone 12 and 12 Mini that Google should be most concerned about, as the hardware around the camera is more desirable than the Pixel 5’s — and pricing is similar.On paper, the Pixel 5 is not a “flagship” phone, due to it using the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor and not the Snapdragon 865 or 865 Plus. It’s another way to chop the price down, and unless you’re a spec-sheet obsessive, it’s not a massive deal. I consider myself a normal user, in that I use the camera, use social apps, make video and voice calls, play a few games, watch video, and keep up with work tasks.It does all these tasks without interruption — and without feeling like it’s underpowered. Play Asphalt 9 Legends, and it’s as visually impressive and smooth to play on the Pixel 5 as it is on the OnePlus 8T. If anything, there are times when the Pixel 5 runs more smoothly than some more powerful phones, such as when it rotates the screen from portrait to landscape and vice versa in YouTube. A lot of this comes down to Android 11, the latest version of Google’s software, and this is an advantage the Pixel 5 has over the competition.Android 11 on the Pixel 5 (and the Pixel 4, Pixel 4a, and Pixel 4a 5G) could be labeled boring, just like the design, but the dullness is its strength. There’s no garnish or additional branded apps, just fast, smooth, and simple software. However, I’ve encountered a couple of problems with my phone that have proved frustrating.The first has been an intermittent fault with the microphone, where it fails to activate so callers can’t hear me, and my voice messages turn out to be silent. The problem is cured by turning the phone off and on again, but you don’t know when the issue arises until it’s too late. My Pixel 5 has dropped my Wi-Fi signal more than other phones, and consistently has one fewer bar of reception on both Wi-Fi and cellular connections. It’s possible this is to do with the metal body.The reception issue is not a deal breaker, but something to be considered if you already live in an area with poor reception. It should be noted that the Pixel 5 has 5G, of course, which opens up new networking possibilities as well. The microphone problem may be an issue with my phone only, and after alerting Google ahead of publication here, I’m expecting a replacement review model to see if the problem persists. This issue has not affected the score of the phone — yet.Battery life is one of the biggest improvements over the Pixel 4. My phone has easily lasted a day with normal use, and if I turn it off overnight, it lasts most of the second day, too. After the woeful Pixel 4, this is most welcome. It’s conservative with power too: With light use on a busy day that saw me ignore my phone, the battery was still above 80% by 4 p.m.The phone comes with an 18W-watt wired charger in the box, and supports wireless charging. That’s a clever trick considering the phone’s body is metal — Google cut a hole in the back and filled it with a resin that is visually indistinguishable from the rest of the body. Place another device on the back of the Pixel 5, and it’ll top up the battery wirelessly using its own power. This worked with my iPhone 11 Pro, but not with my Sony WF-1000XM3 headphones, unfortunately. These reverse wireless charging systems can all be a bit finicky.The Google Pixel 5 costs $699, or 599 British pounds, comes in one version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage space, and is available now from Google, Amazon, and other retailers. It supports 5G, provided you are in an area with coverage and have the proper carrier plan, and the Pixel 5 in the U.S. also includes mmWave 5G support for the Verizon (and increasingly, T-Mobile and AT&T) network.Buy the Pixel 5 and you’ll get a well-proportioned phone with a beautiful screen, an excellent camera, fast performance, and easy-to-use software. What else do you need? Technically, not much, but it would be nice to look at the Pixel 5 and feel something, rather than just ambivalence.There are several great alternatives to the Pixel 5 available. The main challengers are the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and the OnePlus 8T. Both use the Snapdragon 865 processor and higher-class designs, and although the cameras aren’t quite as good as the Pixel’s, most people will find them perfectly decent.The Apple iPhone 12 is shaping up to be a distinct challenger, and the forthcoming iPhone 12 Mini may also take the Pixel 5 on. However, perhaps the best alternative to consider is the Pixel 4a 5G, which does almost everything the Pixel 5 can do but for $200 less at $499. If you’re not worried about the wide-angle camera or 5G, then the $349 Pixel 4a is also excellent.The Pixel 5 is an excellent long-term smartphone purchase. The conservative looks mean it’ll never look more out of date than it does now. It features 5G for the future, as well as two years of major Android software updates guaranteed. It has an IP68 water-resistance rating, and the metal body will be tougher than a glass phone, plus Google makes some attractive cases to complement the Pixel 5. There’s no reason why the phone won’t serve you well for two to three years.Yes, the Pixel 5 is Google’s top smartphone of 2020, and while it doesn’t have the most exciting looks, it represents the best of Google’s software and hardware prowess, all at a great price."
39,ROG Phone 3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-rog-phone-3-review/,"Asus showed how seriously it takes mobile gaming with last year’s launch of the Republic of Gamers-branded ROG Phone 2, which was packed with tech and features specifically engineered to help improve gameplay. Now it’s back with the ROG Phone 3. Externally, not much has changed, and if anything, the space-age design has become less showy — but the story is different inside.The difference the internals make is remarkable. It’s so powerful that if Thanos played PUBG Mobile, he’d do so on an ROG Phone 3. Let’s get into it.The ROG Phone 3 shares a similar look, and an almost identical size, with the ROG Phone 2, but with the sci-fi madness ever so slightly toned down. The glass back is shiny rather than matte, and the exposed vents slashed into the back of the ROG Phone 2 have gone, replaced by a cool transparent section showing the new cooling system inside. I’ve not seen glass transition between transparent and dark like this before, and it looks superb.Despite its exterior, the ROG Phone 3 has not collected fingerprints, and the RGB-equipped ROG logo looks even brighter and more colorful than it did with the matte glass of the ROG Phone 2. The camera module has gained another lens to total three, and it runs horizontally across the device. Asus has reduced the silver, angled lines on the body, which makes the design more mature.Still, the gaming focus remains. The USB Type-C port on the bottom is set to the side to make holding the phone in landscape more comfortable when it’s plugged in, and hidden behind a rubber stopper on the opposite side is another USB Type-C charging port. The phone also has shoulder-mounted “AirTriggers” on the side of the phone (we’ll talk more abut those later).Though comfortable to hold, this is a large smartphone. It’s 9.8mm thick, 171mm long, and 78mm wide. For comparison, the OnePlus 8 Pro is 8.5mm thick, 165mm long, and 74.5mm wide.At 240 grams, the ROG Phone 3 is also one of the heaviest phones out there. It’s neatly balanced in landscape orientation, but I found in portrait mode that the weight was tilted toward the front of the phone. Combined with the slippery body, it often threatened to fall on my face when using it laying down.One thing ROG Phone 2 users may notice is the disappearance of the 3.5mm headphone jack. The integration of 5G antennas in the ROG Phone 3 is one of the reasons the connector wouldn’t fit inside the phone anymore, but if you really want it, there’s a dongle in the box. There’s also an add-on AeroActive Cooler 3 accessory that clips onto the body to aid cooling, and you get that in the box, too.It’s a great accessory. Asus has added two very helpful features: A space to store the rubber port cover you remove from the phone to attach the AeroActive Cooler 3, and a kickstand, too.The kickstand’s great, putting the phone at the perfect angle for movies or for playing games with a controller. The AeroActive Cooler 2, made for the ROG Phone 2, isn’t compatible with the new phone. However, if you bought other accessories including the Twin View Dock or Kunai controller, they will work, due to the two phones having almost identical dimensions.I appreciate the ROG Phone 3’s new, more mature design, but do miss some of the madness from the ROG Phone and ROG Phone 2. I think gaming phones need craziness. Nothing about their existence is sensible, so why not celebrate it a little more?The ROG Phone 3 is the king of gaming smartphones.I’m a casual gamer, meaning I don’t spend hours each day playing online, but the ROG Phone 3 still manages to make the games I do play look better and play more smoothly, all the while providing useful tools that enhance the experience. If it makes me feel like that, I have no doubt people who are more into mobile games will see even greater benefits.The shoulder-mounted AirTriggers are a great example of where the ROG Phone 3 succeeds. They are easily mapped to on-screen controls, can be tapped, held down, swiped, or even spilt into two sections to effectively make four buttons. They made Asphalt 9 Legends’ simple controls quicker to use, and stopped my fingers from covering the screen.The feature is activated in-game using the slide-in screen Game Genie menu, and when you position the AirTrigger activation points on screen, they vibrate when you get the placement correct. In Transformers: Forged to Fight, I used both the tap and swipe features, and while tapping worked well, the swipe feature could be quite awkward to activate at the right time.By squeezing the sides of the phone, you activate X Mode, which boosts phone performance and minimizes distractions when playing games. Use the Enhanced X Mode setting, where everything gets turned up to maximum, and the processor won’t be throttled at all. I didn’t notice any slowdown, dropped frames, or other performance problems playing games on the ROG Phone 3.The 6.59-inch AMOLED screen has a 144Hz refresh rate, 270Hz touch sampling, 10 bit HDR, HDR 10 Plus support, and 25ms touch latency. It’s insanely responsive. Dariusburst is played in a small window in the center of the screen, and requires deft, careful controls to weave between the scenery and the onslaught of bullets. The ROG Phone 3 made this considerably easier because of its large, highly responsive touchscreen.Then there’s the sound. Asus has worked with an audio company called Dirac, passing over bigger brands like Dolby, and the result is often extraordinary. There’s a level of detail, clarity, and definition you don’t always find on phones, along with a wide soundstage and a genuinely full sound from the dual stereo speakers. The ROG Phone 3 sounds like no other smartphone.Over the course of a few hours, I played Asphalt 9 Legends, 1945, Real Racing 3, and Dariusburst, plus a few other casual titles, and it performed impeccably. You can feel some heat generated from the phone, but it’s located at the center bottom edge of the device in landscape mode, so you have to feel around for it. My hands didn’t get sweaty, and I never felt the need to shift my grip because the phone’s body was warm.The ROG Phone 3 is compatible with Google Stadia as well, and it comes with three months of free Stadia Pro access, meaning it’s not all about games from Google Play. It’s easy to pass gaming phones off as pointless, but when they’re done correctly and thoughtfully, the benefits are obvious. The Asus ROG Phone 3 demonstrates this perfectly.Asus has worked hard to make the ROG Phone 3 a usable smartphone for daily use, whether you are dedicated to gaming or not. The camera is an integral part of this.The triple-lens rear camera has a 64-megapixel IMX686 main sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, joined by a 13-megapixel ultra-wide sensor and a 5-megapixel macro sensor. In the bezel above the screen, there is a 24-megapixel selfie camera. The rear camera has a variety of different modes, including a night mode, portrait mode, a motion-tracking video mode, and a pro video mode. It shoots video at 4K and in HDR with electronic stabilization.It’s decent, and more than capable enough provided it’s your second priority on a smartphone. There’s no zoom mode, but both the wide-angle and macro modes provide creative fun, so it’s not desperately missed. It can be inconsistent, especially in overcast conditions, where it underexposes quite a bit, resulting in a loss of detail. Sunny day HDR shots can look great, and the macro camera definitely surprises with it ability.The selfie camera has a heavy-handed beauty mode enabled by default, a portrait mode with only average edge-detection that can also wash out skin tones.I found the ROG Phone 3’s camera to be fine for general use. While there are more versatile camera phones out there, it’s solid. For a gaming phone, where the camera will always be a secondary concern, it’s much better than many will expect.Asus says it wants to “lead the industry to the next level” with the ROG Phone 3. It pioneered 120Hz screens and high touch sampling rates, as well as how to use a high-end processor to the best of its ability, with the ROG Phone 2. For the ROG Phone 3, the 144Hz screen, 270Hz touch sampling rate, and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor with up to 16GB of RAM sees it easily win the current smartphone spec sheet wars.The Snapdragon 865 Plus is a monster, and the first mobile processor to exceed a 3GHz clock speed. Paired with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage in my review phone, it’s hard to imagine ever needing more power or capacity.Here’s how it performed in some benchmark tests:3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 6,601 Vulkan (Without X Mode. App crashes with X Mode active)Geekbench 5: 970 Single Core/3340 Multi CoreThese scores beat the ROG Phone 2, but are only a little higher than the OnePlus 8 Pro. They are very similar to the Red Magic 5G, where the 3DMark test was actually lower on the ROG Phone 3, but this may be to do with app issues, as it would not run with X Mode active on the Asus phone.The 6,000mAh battery lasts two days, which may seem a little disappointing given the overall capacity, but don’t forget it’s powering a great deal of high-end hardware. Asus’s own tests say it’ll play 9.6 hours of Asphalt 9 Legends on a full charge, compared to 5.7 hours from a OnePlus 8 Pro.Asus has added a new PowerMaster app, part of its efforts to increase the longevity of the battery. Interestingly, it has a slow-charge mode, definable limits to make sure the battery doesn’t just sit at 100% all night (not good for making it last, says Asus), and a selection of battery modes too. The wired charging provides 30W of power, but there is no wireless charging.Elsewhere inside, if you were to take the phone apart, you’d find carefully placed Wi-Fi antennas to ensure the best signal possible in portrait or landscape orientation, four microphones positioned so they don’t get covered during landscape gameplay, and 5G support. Cellular and Wi-Fi reception has been consistently excellent, and call quality is great, too. I don’t have 5G reception in my local area, so I have not been able to test this aspect.There are two main theme options on the ROG Phone 3: Showier, stylized themes, and a classic theme to make the phone look more like Android on a Pixel. It’s the same approach the company took with the ROG Phone 2 and the Asus Zenfone 6, and a very sensible decision. Both operate in an identical way, but there’s no question the Classic theme makes the phone look more mature, and is perhaps a little faster for everyday use.Apps are hidden inside a drawer in both themes, while the notification shade provides interactive notifications, plus there is a standard dark mode. Asus installs its own game app called Armory Crate where all your games are stored together, with the option to set individual parameters for each, like automatically activating X Mode, upping the screen refresh rate, and assigning macros. It’s also the place to modify the system lighting.I used swipe gesture controls, which worked without a problem. Although there is an always-on screen option, the notification options are limited, reducing its usefulness.Asus’ software on the ROG Phone 3 has been reliable and fast, and it’s great to see the company continuing the good work it began on the Zenfone 6. The in-display fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable, with face unlock to back it up. I’ve had no problems with either.Asus has not announced the final price in dollars for the ROG Phone 3 at the time of writing, only the price in euros. The 16GB/512GB version reviewed here is 1,099 euros, and a 12GB/512GB version is 999 euros. The phone will be available from the end of July in Europe, but starting out with the basic “Strix” edition, which has a Snapdragon 865, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB storage for 799 euros.The ROG Phone 3 will be available in North America before September, and we’d expect the euro prices to convert directly over to dollars, meaning the 16GB/512GB model should be around $1,099. Asus will officially confirm prices when the U.S. launch date is announced. The cheapest Strix model will not be sold in the U.S..The ROG Phone 3 is unrivaled among gaming phones. This should tell you all you need to know about whether it’s for you. It’s a spec monster, providing all the power anyone will need for just about any task they’d want to do on a phone. If a game doesn’t run well on the ROG Phone 3, it doesn’t run well on a phone, period.What if you’re not a big mobile gamer? The ROG Phone 3 is one of the best multimedia phones available. Video is superb due to the phone’s excellent screen and speakers. However, you won’t have a use for the many game-centric features, and may miss a better camera.If you want a straight-up gaming smartphone, no. If you want a phone that’s an all-rounder, the $900 OnePlus 8 Pro has good gaming credentials and masses of power, while the $1,100 Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and the $1,300 Oppo Find X2 Pro are strong flagships that put the emphasis on the camera. Perhaps the best alternative to the ROG Phone 3 is the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, due not only to the phone’s performance, but to the games available in the App Store.Asus promises Android 11 will come to the ROG Phone 3, and that it will get security updates for at least two years. However, it has not given a time frame for Android 11’s arrival. The ROG Phone 3 is not water resistant. It’s made of glass and quite heavy, so getting one of Asus’s cool cases is wise.This aside, the massive specifications ensure the phone will still feel fresh in a couple of years time, and Asus’ efforts to help the battery perform its best for longer should help push the phone’s usefulness way past two years as well. If you want to hang on to your new phone, the ROG Phone 3 is a very safe purchase.Yes. It’s the mobile gaming champion that has the guts and ability to make you a mobile gaming champion too."
40,Samsung Galaxy Note 20,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review/,"Go big or go home. That’s always been Samsung’s motto with the Galaxy Note series, and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is its biggest effort yet. The screen is even larger than last year’s Galaxy Note 10 Plus, and there’s also more power, more features, and more technology — all aimed at improving productivity and increasing its media capabilities.Your wallet had better be bigger too, as the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra starts at $1,299. Samsung’s approach to outdoing the competition is simple: Beat them into submission by offering everything a phone buyer could possibly want, in a phone that will last for years.Pushing the boundaries of what’s acceptable in terms of device size and price, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra claims the top Android option among the best smartphones this year, even outdoing the Galaxy Note 10 Plus — a phone we called the best Android phone of 2019.Updated on September 23, 2020: After several software updates following release, I used the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra for another week. Palm rejection and edge recognition are significantly improved, to the point where remaining issues are barely noticeable. Our score has changed from eight to nine, and it’s now eligible for our Editor’s Choice award.If the design of the Galaxy Note 10 Plus was a little ordinary, the Note 20 Ultra is anything but. That’s especially evident in the new Mystic Bronze color of the devices in the photos. The camera module is massive, protrudes by several millimeters, and dominates the back of the phone. It’s very different from the dainty module on the Note 10 Plus, and even more in your face than the Galaxy S20 Ultra’s module. The glass covering has a strong, bright sheen in different lighting conditions.The Mystic Bronze itself falls somewhere between gold and pink, and is classy rather than gaudy. The matte finish has plenty of grip and resists fingerprints, but the glass over the camera module doesn’t, and it often needed a good wipe before taking photos. Take away the monster camera module and the Note 20 Ultra shares the same basic shape as the Note 10 Plus, where the curved sides taper down to a point while remaining perfectly comfortable to grip.Samsung has swapped the buttons over to the right-hand side of the phone and, for me, as a right-handed person, it’s far more natural than the Note 10 Plus, where the buttons were on the left. In the new layout, the S Pen stylus is stored on the left side of the phone, the top and bottom of the phone are flat, and there’s a single hole-punch selfie camera in the screen.I have average-sized hands, and the Note 20 Ultra is right on the edge of being too big and too heavy at 77.2mm (3.04 inches) wide, 8.1mm (0.32 inches) thick, and 208 grams (0.46 pounds). It is well-balanced but can feel top-heavy when you’re using it while laying down. It’s also frustrating to juggle it with one hand when you just want to check a notification or take a selfie.It’s these quick tasks that can make using the massive Note 20 Ultra a bit of a chore, and sometimes I’d long for a smaller, more manageable device. I felt this less with the 196-gram, 7.9mm-thick Note 10 Plus.Be prepared for a period of adjustment as you get used to the size.The Note 20 Ultra is a whopper of a phone and requires commitment to carry and use every day. The reward is worth the effort, but if you’re graduating from a smaller phone (which is just about every other phone available), be prepared for a period of adjustment as you get used to it.This applies even if you’re coming from the Note 10 Plus, which feels surprisingly lithe and usable compared with the Note 20 Ultra. I always appreciate an extra-large screen, but the massive chassis required to accommodate it can feel like a step too far.A 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen with a 1,440 x 3,088 pixel resolution, a variable 120Hz refresh rate, and even HDR10+ support catches your attention. The Note 20 Ultra is the first Samsung phone to use Samsung Display’s variable refresh rate technology, which adapts depending on what you’re doing on your phone. For example, it’ll use 120Hz when playing games that support it, or switch to 60Hz for movies, or even 10Hz for still photos. The aim is to be more power efficient.The screen is lovely to look at, just like the majority of Samsung phones.This adaptive refresh rate is set as standard, but it’s possible to force it to permanently use a 60Hz refresh rate. Similarly, the resolution by default is 2,316 x 1,080, and it must be manually changed to 3,088 x 1,440 — to enjoy this, however, you have to use a 60Hz refresh rate. It’s lovely to look at, just like the majority of Samsung phones. I used it in the default setting most of the time and had no complaints about the quality or sharpness.Scrolling through some apps is not as smooth as I’d expected. I experienced some jerkiness in Twitter and in parts of Chrome too, which may have more to do with Android than the screen. There are minimal bezels at the top and the bottom of the display, and it gently curves down the sides to give a large viewing area. Even the hole-punch for the selfie camera is tiny.Watching Woyshnis Media’s YouTube video featuring the Lamborghini Huracán Perfomante and Mercedes Benz AMG GTS is a great demonstration of how fantastic the screen is, and also how a display tweak called the Video Enhancer works. The green Lamborghini pops off the screen with the mode active, while the darker AMG remains subdued until you get close, and the colorful flake in the paint becomes noticeable. This neat balance isn’t common in display-enhancing modes, and meant I didn’t mind leaving the Video Enhancer on most of the time.I put the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra alongside the equally stunning Sony Xperia 1 II to test video, and the results are surprising. The Note 20 Ultra doesn’t play 4K YouTube video like the Sony phone, but watching Carfection’s Porsche Taycan review, it hardly shows. The Note 20 Ultra’s screen is vibrant with color, yet still delivers crisp whites, and the large size really does return a beautiful viewing experience.There are stereo speakers on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, one set at the top of the screen for calls, and another on the bottom of the phone. The sound is full, with plenty of midrange and clear highs. As you’d expect, there’s little low-end bass. It’s loud though, and while the sound gets pretty bright, there’s no distortion at maximum volume. The Note 20 Ultra also has Dolby Atmos support.The screen and media experience on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is superb, but was marred during my early experience using pre-release software by problematic palm and finger rejection at the edges of the screen. I returned to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra several weeks, and several software updates, after its release to find the vast majority of these problems had been cured. It’s not absolutely perfect — buttons right at the edge of the screen can still not always recognize your taps — but for the most part, the problem has entirely gone away.The camera is one of the major upgrades the Note 20 Ultra boasts over the Note 10 Plus. Samsung’s 108-megapixel 1/1.33-inch sensor is on board, taken from the Galaxy S20 Ultra. It’s joined by a 12-megapixel periscope zoom with 5x optical and 10x hybrid zoom, but with its maximum Space Zoom level reduced to 50x instead of 100x.Finally, there’s a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, a new laser autofocus system, and optical image stabilization on the main and periscope lenses. It can also record video at up to 8K resolution at 24 frames per second and 4K at 60fps, with both optical and electronic stabilization, plus HDR10+ support.Although the specs are clearly an improvement over the Note 10 Plus, the two main cameras take very similar photos, with only a little more detail coming from the Note 20 Ultra. This changes when you go to 5x and 10x zoom though, where the Note 20 Ultra surpasses the Note 10 Plus’ ability to take clear, detailed photos.The Note 10 Plus has a better 2x optical zoom mode though, which in some cases may make it more usable, as 5x gets you in very close to a subject indeed.It’s easy to love the Note 20 Ultra’s camera. The photos it takes are full of color, popping off the screen in a pleasing way without appearing too artificial or oversaturated. At nighttime, the low-light performance is great too, with the camera injecting real atmosphere after dusk. Zoom in to 5x and 10x and shots still have a lot of detail, but 50x is the same pointless endeavor as 100x on the Galaxy S20 Ultra.The phone includes the excellent Single Take mode with some subtle changes. With this mode, you shoot a short video instead of a single still, and the camera creates multiple different edits including stills, filtered shots, GIFs, and more for you. You’ll never regret taking a photo rather than a video.In the new mode, you can select the amount of time you shoot a video for — between five and 15 second –, and it returns more options from even the most basic captures than it did before. Not all are gold, but I’d rather have too much choice than not enough.The 108-megapixel mode and the 8K video mode are gimmicks. The 8K video looks great if you own an 8K TV, but if you don’t, the footage just takes up masses of storage space on your phone.Take a 108-megapixel still and you’ll struggle to pick it out in the gallery. Once you find it, you can crop it down without losing much detail, but this is a niche feature, especially since you could also use one of the Note 20 Ultra’s very capable zoom settings. These modes work as intended, and 8K video may be more helpful in the future, but right now they’re not a reason to buy this phone.How about selfies? Some may consider them washed out — and compared to the iPhone 11 Pro, they’re definitely on the light side — but I liked the results.The editing suite inside the Gallery app is also worth mentioning, as it’s full-featured and very easy to use, and the auto-enhance setting is usually suitably effective in emphasizing the colors in selfies. Samsung has added a pro mode to the video, and while I like the way you can zoom in and out manually for a cinematic look, pro modes are complicated and require a degree of expert knowledge. Most people will just use the auto mode, I suspect, but if you’re a competent photographer, it will be very welcome.The core features of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s camera — the main sensor, periscope zoom, wide-angle, Night mode, and selfies — are all excellent, and you’ll take photos that are instantly ready to share in just about any environment or situation. Explore more, and the Note 20 Ultra’s camera really stands out.Now housed on the lower left of the phone, the S Pen is identical in size and shape to the last one, but it’s easier to remove and replace than on the Note 10 Plus. Samsung made a big thing about the latency reduction to 9 milliseconds, so is this noticeable? Not really, no, and perhaps it’s because I’m used to the Note 10 Plus, but I found my scribbled notes were much neater on that phone. I think the sensitivity needs some adjustment, and the palm rejection problems don’t help matters here either.The new convert-to-text feature is very accurate. An easily edited box appears on screen when you convert, and while I never had to change any words, the formatting was always off and needed neatening up. The S Pen’s Air Gestures work well. For example, a reverse swipe goes back a step, and a scribble action opens a window to write on the screen. The button still works as a remote shutter key for the camera too.Yes, the S Pen is a reason to buy the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra — if for no other reason than if you want a stylus, you don’t have a lot of other choices.Living with the Note 10 Plus on various occasions over the past year taught me it can be useful, but you’ve got to really have a use for it in mind. While there are special features, they aren’t compelling enough to make you want to use it if you’re not already planning to take notes or draw.Despite the size and weight of the phone, it’s a great gaming machine, mostly because the screen is so large and the S Pen is an interesting alternative to using your finger. I played DariusBurst SP, one of my favorite mobile games, and I was far more precise when dodging bullets in the more difficult later levels using the S Pen rather than my finger. It worked equally well playing 1945 and other shooters. The S Pen’s new low latency almost certainly helps, although I wouldn’t say Scribble Racer 2 felt any more precise than before.Software updates after release have really improved the S Pen. It’s considerably more accurate when writing on screen, mostly due to the vastly improved palm rejection system. I can lean my palm on the screen and still write very neatly using the S Pen, something that really wasn’t possible using the pre-release software.Buy the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra in the U.S. and it comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, but buy the same phone in the U.K. or elsewhere in Europe and it’ll come with Samsung’s own Exynos 990 processor. This is the model tested here, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space. There is a MicroSD card slot to boost this if you need more space. Regardless of where you buy the phone, it comes with 5G connectivity. Here are the benchmark results:Geekbench 5: 919 Single Core/2708 Multi Core3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 5179 (Vulkan)These figures are considerably lower than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 inside the OnePlus 8 Pro and the Snapdragon 865 Plus in the Asus ROG Phone 3. I didn’t notice any performance problems and benchmark results don’t always reflect real-world speed, but it’s hard to ignore the difference between Samsung’s Exynos 990 and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 Plus in these benchmark results.Use the Exynos-powered Galaxy Note 20 Ultra fairly hard, and it will get a little hot — never to the point where it’s uncomfortable to hold, but you definitely get sweaty palm. I noticed this playing Asphalt 9 Legends, but not Hill Climb Racer, so if you never play high-end games or make long calls, you may not notice.Android 10 with Samsung’s OneUI 2.5 is installed, along with the July 2020 Android Security Patch, and it operates in the same way as the software found on the Galaxy S20 series devices. It’s bold and colorful, with plenty of ways to customize the look, right down to an effective Dark Mode and a helpful always-on screen. It’s fast and reliable, and the gesture controls are fluid. I had no issues with the software at all.The Note 20 Ultra’s 4,500mAh battery has a lot to cope with, so don’t expect it to last longer than a day if your screen time is five hours or more. Use it moderately for less time and it will just about creep through a second working day. During my time with the phone, it has not lasted two full days on a single charge, and with an average of three to four hours screen time each day, it’s at around 30% by midnight.Considering the tech the battery has to power, I don’t consider this too bad, and the phone hasn’t left me concerned I’ll need an emergency top-up to last the day. However, it’s not going to please the hardcore power-users Samsung wants to attract with the Note series, and if you’re going to use 5G, expect even more battery drain. I don’t have 5G in my local area, so have I not tested this feature. The 4G LTE signals are good, and Wi-Fi calling on supported networks is helpful, although I did find Wi-Fi range was a little short. The 25-watt wired charger takes the battery to 50% in 30 minutes, and you can use wireless charging too.An in-display fingerprint sensor secures the Note 20 Ultra and, unfortunately, it’s as finicky as the one on the Note 10 Plus and the Galaxy S20 Ultra. It’s not as fast to recognize your print as the OnePlus 8 Pro, or as quick to unlock the phone. There is a face unlock system, but it’s similarly ponderous and has an awkward way of activating. As a result, I accidentally turned the screen off and on again while I waited for it to work. Unlocking Samsung phones generally is frustrating compared to almost all other phones I use.I’ve been using the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra as my main phone for nearly two weeks, and there are still many features to explore, or that I have not used for any appreciable length of time. This is unusual, and highlights just how much effort Samsung has put into making the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra its most powerful and feature-packed smartphone available.An example is the new Wireless DeX system. Samsung DeX takes your phone display and puts it on a monitor or television, then changes the software into a desktop-style system where you can run apps, view photos, watch video, and even play games. Previously, DeX required an HDMI cable or special dock to operate, but the Note 20 Ultra introduces wireless support. The feature likely works best with Samsung televisions, but refused to link with Screen Mirroring on my Sony Android TV.The list goes on. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a power-sharing mode to wirelessly charge the Galaxy Watch 3, Galaxy Buds Plus, or the Galaxy Buds Live, it provides access to Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass to stream console games onto your phone, and later this year a software update will add the ability to run your phone apps on a Windows 10 PC. Right now, Samsung Notes sync with OneNote. There really is a ton to discover on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and that helps increase the longevity.The 128GB Galaxy Note 20 Ultra costs $1,299, or $1,449 for the 512GB model. In the U.K. the 128GB phone is 1,179 British pounds and the 512GB phone is 1,279 pounds. It’s sold through Samsung’s own online store and on contract with the vast majority of carriers. It’s available to purchase now.However, if you’re not yet ready to dish out that big cash, you can still get your hand on a quality Galaxy or smartphone through our best Samsung Galaxy deals and best smartphone deals list.The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the biggest, baddest, most hardcore flagship smartphone you can buy today. It has everything you could want from a phone today — and pretty much everything for tomorrow too, including 5G, making it a safe purchase for someone who wants a phone that will last for years.A word on the price. It’s expensive, but when you consider how powerful and capable it is, and how many features it offers, there’s more longevity in the Note 20 Ultra than many other flagship phones that cost a few hundred dollars less. Samsung says it designed it this way, and it shows. Buy it, and you may even begin to consider changing your phone for several years.If you want the best technical specifications, a stylus, and a brilliant camera, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra stands alone. If you aren’t that worried about the S Pen stylus, the Galaxy S20 Ultra is a decent alternative, although I prefer the Note 20 Ultra’s design and camera. We also have a comparison between Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and Galaxy S20 Ultra to help you decide which to go for. At this price, you should also be looking at the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, which has a standout camera and screen.If you don’t want to spend so much money, and again aren’t worried about the stylus, the OnePlus 8 Pro is a great buy with its pretty design, decent camera, and stunning screen. If you’re really keen on gaming ,the Asus ROG Phone 3 is another high-spec, focused phone that’s worth considering.Should you upgrade if you have the Galaxy Note 10 Plus? I don’t think so. The camera is a definite improvement, but with it comes additional bulk. If you want a Note phone but not at the Note 20 Ultra’s price, shopping around for a Note 10 Plus would be a shrewd move.Ages and ages. The Note 20 Ultra’s power and ability mean that even in two years time, it should still feel fresh. It has an IP68 water-resistance rating, but isn’t rugged, so you’ll still want to put it in a case. There’s 5G for the future too, and you can record 8K video ready for when you buy an 8K TV.Samsung promises three generations of software updates for its most recent smartphones. This means the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra should receive Android updates beyond a two-year contract, extending its useful life further than most will expect. However, Samsung has not committed to any time frames, so although Android 11 and beyond will arrive on the phone, you may have to be patient.Yes. You’ll be spending a lot, but you’ll be getting a phone you won’t have to think about replacing for years."
41,Samsung Galaxy S20,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s20-review/,"The Galaxy S20 is one of the best smartphones. It’s also the smallest member of the Galaxy S20 family. Yet Samsung erred by not carrying over the Galaxy S10e’s even smaller 5.8-inch screen size.What is the Galaxy S20? It’s a brilliantly capable smartphone that can’t distinguish itself from the ever-so-slightly bigger Galaxy S20 Plus to reach the underserved audience crying out to buy a diminutive flagship phone. Let’s take a closer look at where the Galaxy S20 succeeds, and where it fails.The Galaxy S20 looks exactly the same as the Galaxy S20 Plus, just on a slightly smaller scale. It’s thin and light at 163 grams and 7.9mm thick, and built around an aluminum metal chassis with Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and rear. The screen measures 6.2 inches, so it’s smaller than the 6.7-inch Galaxy S20 Plus, and just a touch larger than the iPhone 11. I’m very happy to be using the blue version rather than the dull gray Galaxy S20 Plus, as it injects muchneeded character. It’s fun to look at, instead of something that could have been dreamed up by 1984’s Winston Smith on an especially depressing day.It’s more natural to hold and use, thanks in part to the 20:9 aspect ratio, when compared to the Galaxy S20 Plus and the OnePlus 8, but it’s not that small. Although it’s the baby of the S20 range, it’s not a small phone. If you’ve held the Galaxy S10, it’s essentially the same size, just with a slightly bigger screen. This is possible due to the astonishingly slim bezels. They’re almost invisible down the sides, and only black slivers at the top and bottom. Using the Galaxy S20 really is like holding one large screen in your hand.I like the little details in the design too, from the way the aluminum chassis bends around the volume and power buttons, to the dainty camera bump on the back, which looks much less offensive here than it does on the S20 Plus. It’s a friendlier, neater, better all-around design. However, the larger screen on the S20 Plus wins me over every time when it comes to watching videos and playing games.The Galaxy S20 is smaller than the other phones in the range, but it’s not so small that the trade-off between screen size and portability becomes a consideration. The Galaxy S20 fails to be a true compact flagship phone, but it succeeds in being the most attractive of the three Galaxy S20 devices available this year. It’s a conundrum, one ultimately solved by buying the blue or pink Galaxy S20 Plus.The 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED has a 3200 x 1440 pixel resolution for an even higher pixel density than the S20 Plus at 563ppi. It has a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR10+ support, and is among the most amazingly beautiful and sharp smartphone screens you’ll stare at. This is also a problem, because you really do have to stare at it, as it feels quite restrictive when taking advantage of its ability to watch video. You’ll enjoy the colors and sharpness more on the S20 Plus or S20 Ultra.For reading emails and notifications, as well as web browsing, the screen size is great. The 120Hz refresh rate is not activated by default, but it’s highly recommended. It smooths scrolling throughout, resulting in less eye strain and a more pleasant visual experience. It comes with a caveat, in that it can only operate with the screen showing Full HD resolution, and not with QHD resolution active.Fire up some video, and YouTube shows 1080p quality content with HDR, if available. Using the NowTV app to watch HBO’s vapid-but-visually supercharged Ballers looks unbelievable, with masses of detail and a very natural color palette. However, the screen aspect ratio hurts the viewing experience, because there are black bars running down either side. Zoom in to fill the screen and you lose some of the image at the top and bottom. Audio is very enjoyable, with plenty of volume, although the bass is limited.Gaming is great, mostly because of the phone’s immense power and ability, plus the wide range of games available in the Google Play Store. Of course, it’s not quite as immersive as it is on the larger S20 Plus. Dariusburst is a good example of why, as you have to shrink the view right down to compensate for the 20:9 aspect ratio screen. Hill Climb Racer doesn’t suffer in the same way, and although I never really challenge the 240Hz touch sampling rate, the S20 always feels sharp and responsive, making games enjoyable.The Galaxy S20’s screen is superb, but while I’m willing to work around the downsides of the 20:9 aspect ratio on the larger models, I’m less willing to do so on the midsize S20. If I’m going to pay for the kind of specs and media ability here, I want to be able to truly enjoy them. That means a larger screen.The camera on the Galaxy S20 is the same as the one on the Galaxy S20 Plus it’s just in a slightly more compact bump on the back. It houses the main 12-megapixel f/1.8 aperture sensor with optical image stabilization, plus a second 12-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, and a third 64-megapixel telephoto with a 3x optical zoom. It shoots 4K video, has a time-of-flight sensor, and on the front is a 10-megapixel selfie camera.I found it provides the same performance as the S20 Plus. The camera is versatile, with wide-angle and zoom features, takes decent night mode shots, and has a great phot- editing suite built into the app. The portrait mode is effective but needs some careful use as it sometimes fails to focus, and edge detection does suffer with more complex shapes. When it works, the edit mode to remove color from the background in portrait shots can produce some atmospheric, eye-catching shots.Please refer to the Galaxy S20 Plus review for more in-depth evaluation, as the camera is the same, and take a look at some of the photo examples here to see how the Galaxy S20 performs against it. The saturation level may put some off, but it’s more restrained than previous Samsung cameras, and I found it gives images taken on sunny days just the right degree of life and visual punch. Note that Night Mode can increase noise while brightening shaded areas, often making the non-Night Mode shot preferable.Ultimately, the Galaxy S20 takes detailed and colorful photos that you want to share with minimum editing. There are more capable cameras out there, from the iPhone 11 Pro to the Huawei P40 Pro, but the S20 (and the S20 Plus) are crowd-pleasers that will take photos you will be happy with, day or night, and in most situations.Like the phone itself, the camera is a brilliant all-rounder, which happily does without the gimmicky features on the Galaxy S20 Ultra.The Galaxy S20 has the same Android 10-based OneUI 2.0 software installed as the S20 Plus and the S20 Ultra. I’ve gone into more detail about it in my Galaxy S20 Plus review, but my overall impression remains the same. The colorful, bold, and quite large icons stand out on the screen, and it’s obvious what they do at a glance, plus the look can be customized. For example, by default, it’s a 4 x 4 grid of icons, making it look a bit childish, but it can be switched to a 5 x 4 or a 6 x 4 layout for those who don’t like the big-print-style version.I have not had problems with any apps, notifications are delivered without issue, and the design hasn’t strayed so far away from Android on a Google Pixel 4 that it’s a mystery voyage — though it’s different enough that it has its own identity. The haptic feedback is tactile, but I don’t like the standard Samsung keyboard because it doesn’t have swipe typing, so switching to Google’s Gboard is preferable.The problems remain the same. The swipe-in Samsung Daily screen is useless, and the need to use a hidden software button to power off the phone because the hardware button is mapped for Bixby is irritating. On the positive side, using Samsung DeX to connect to my MacBook works well, and way better than it used to be since it now includes the ability to sync photos and music.I mostly relied on the face-unlock system to secure the Galaxy S20. It’s fast and reliable, even though the phone sometimes doesn’t wake up properly when I pick it up, forcing me to press the power button, which then slows the process down even more. The in-display fingerprint sensor is the opposite. It’s a bit slow and unreliable.The golden specs just keep on coming. Purchased in the U.S., the Galaxy S20 has the Snapdragon 865 processor inside with 12GB of RAM, making it one of the most powerful smartphones you can buy at the moment. I’m using the European version with a Samsung Exynos 990 chipset for this review. Here are the benchmark results to see how it compares to the competition.Geekbench 5: 2753 Muilt-Core/905 Single-Core3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 5198 VulkanUnsurprisingly, this is almost the same as the Galaxy S20 Plus, which puts it a little behind the Oppo Find X2 Pro and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 865. This indicates how the U.S. Galaxy S20 phones will perform. The OnePlus 8 Pro performed better in the gaming benchmark test, likely attributable to not only the Snapdragon 865’s graphics chip, but also the phone’s additional gaming modes, which are more comprehensive than the Galaxy S20’s.The smallest Galaxy S20 phone gets the smallest battery. It’s a 4,000mAh cell and is an adequate performer. For daily, moderate use, including a few phone and video calls, the Galaxy S20 ended the day with around 15% left by 11 p.m., but this was when connected to Wi-Fi, so I’d expect it to be pretty much empty if it had been using a cellular network. Using the included 25W USB Type-C wired charger, it goes from 0 to 55% in 30 minutes, and charging to full takes an hour and 15 minutes approximately. The Galaxy S20 also has wireless charging.Although the Galaxy S20 has 5G, I do not have 5G coverage in my area. I have tried it on both the Vodafone and the EE 4G network. Calls are clear for both, and reception has been good using both cellular and Wi-Fi calling. Although the speaker is small, I never had to constantly reposition the phone to find the right position to hear the caller.The Galaxy S20 costs $1,000 and comes in the cloud blue color seen above, plus a cloud pink, cloud white, and cosmic gray. It’s available to buy now from Samsung, various retailers, and with a contract with carriers. In the U.K., the phone costs 800 British pounds, and is sold through all major carriers, and through Samsung itself too.You get a standard one-year warranty to cover manufacturing defects, and if you buy the phone directly through Samsung, you can add a Premium Care package that adds accidental damage coverage and 24/7 care for $12 per month.There are also some discounted alternatives too. If you want those options you can always check our lists for the best Samsung Galaxy deals and smartphone deals.The Galaxy S20 is an excellent smartphone, but it doesn’t differentiate itself enough from the larger, more immersive-to-use Galaxy S20 Plus, isn’t cheap enough to be tempting as a budget buy, and isn’t small enough to be a truly compact flagship. If you’re going to spend $1,000 or more on a phone with one of the best screens in the business, you may as well get it in a size where you enjoy it, and that’s on the Galaxy S20 Plus rather than the S20. Provided you understand this, the Galaxy S20 is still a superb smartphone.Yes. The Galaxy S20 Plus is the better buy in the Galaxy S20 range. Read our rundown of the Galaxy S20’s and Galaxy S20 Plus‘ specs if you want more details.If you only want to spend $1,000 on a new phone, then take a very good look at the $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro and the $1,000 OnePlus 8 Pro. Both seriously challenge the Galaxy S20, with excellent battery, camera, and screen performance, all at the same price. The 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro will fulfill your desire for a sensibly sized flagship too. You can compare the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S20 yourself if you read our in-depth piece about them.We also think the $700 iPhone 11 is a great buy. If you want a brilliant camera phone and aren’t worried about battery life, then the Google Pixel 4 XL is worth looking at, and if you’re in the U.K. and want a less common alternative, the Oppo Find X2 Pro fills the gap if you don’t mind spending more.Complete with the fastest Qualcomm processor you can get at the moment, a beautiful screen, a decent camera, and 5G for the future, the Galaxy S20 will easily last the duration of a two-year contract and even longer.It has an IP68 water-resistance rating, so it will survive if it gets wet, but the glass body will benefit from being put in a case if you’re a bit clumsy. Samsung does provide regular software updates for its phones, and its flagships tend to be well-served, but don’t expect them to arrive as fast as they would if you bought a Google Pixel 4 XL or an iPhone 11 Pro.No. Most people should go for the larger Galaxy S20 Plus."
42,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review/,"There’s no getting around it — phones are getting really expensive. But as flagship devices get increasingly pricey, a whole new segment of the market has popped up: The premium midrange. That’s exactly where the Samsung Galaxy S20 Fan Edition lives, and if you’re looking for a premium Samsung experience without paying an arm and a leg, it’s one of the best Android phones.The name “Fan Edition” doesn’t really describe what the phone really is. A better name would be the Galaxy S20 Lite. You’re not really getting everything that the Galaxy S20 has to offer. But you’re getting all the important stuff, with a few added bonus features along the way, with an enticing price cut.It’s clear that the Galaxy S20 FE is a derivative of the original Galaxy S20 — it looks just like the standard device. But it’s also made from slightly different materials. Gone is the glass back, in favor of the plastic back found on the standard Galaxy Note 20. But while in theory it’s not as premium, I actually kind of like the soft-touch feel it offers, and I didn’t really miss the glass.The device also sets itself apart from the standard Galaxy S20, in that it’s available in a larger range of colors. I’m reviewing the Cloud Navy model, but it’s also available in more interesting colors, like Cloud Red, Cloud Lavender, and Cloud Orange. Safe to say, there should be something there for everyone.The rest of the phone’s design is pretty standard fare. There’s a USB-C port on the bottom, a volume rocker and power button on the right, and a rectangular camera module on the top left of the phone’s back. It’s not as thick as the Galaxy S20 Ultra or Note 20 Ultra, which is nice to see, but obviously, you also won’t get the same camera specs as the more expensive phone. We’ll get into that later.The Galaxy S20 FE is actually a little larger than the standard Galaxy S20. While the original device has a 6.2-inch display, the S20 FE has a larger 6.5-inch display. Also unlike the Galaxy S20, this phone has a 1080p resolution. It seems that the high resolution is a feature Samsung wants to reserve for its pricier devices.It’s still a great-looking display though. It’s a Super AMOLED display, and it has an impressive 120Hz refresh rate, just like the other S20s. The result is an extremely smooth-feeling experience, and a display that’s very responsive to touch. We’re hoping that more phones get high-refresh rate displays over the next year or so, but until then, it’s pretty impressive that a $700 phone sits in at 120Hz. It also beats competitors, though only marginally.The most obvious competitor here is the OnePlus 8, which also has a 1080p resolution, but caps the refresh rate at 90Hz. (The forthcoming Google Pixel 5 will have a 1080p 90Hz display as well.) To be clear, the difference between 60Hz and 90Hz is much more immediately obvious than the difference between 90Hz and 120Hz. But for those that can notice a difference, 120Hz will be appreciated.It’s also important to note here that the display is flat, not curved. I kind of like the look of curved displays, but others disagree. In any case, considering the flat display, you shouldn’t run into as many issues surrounding accidental palm presses.While Samsung has made clear compromises in the design and display, it hasn’t really under the hood. You’ll still get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor in the U.S. 5G version, or an Exynos 990 outside of the U.S., coupled with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM — and as a result, the phone will easily handle everything you can throw at it in 2020 and beyond. That includes productivity apps, mobile gaming, and so on.Predictably, the phone handled games like Call of Duty: Mobile with ease, and multitasking with even four or five apps is no problem. Benchmark results confirm the great performance in day-to-day use. Here’s a rundown of the results we achieved.These results don’t quite reach the heights that we achieved with the OnePlus 8, but they’re close, and in real life, you won’t really miss the extra 20 single-core points on GeekBench 5. Also, we’re reviewing the lower-end 6GB RAM model, so upgrading your RAM might be the way to go if you really care about that performance edge.Gone are the days when incredible cameras were reserved for the best of the best phones. With devices like the Google Pixel 4a, phone makers are getting wise to the fact that people who spend $450 or more on a phone should be able to get a premium camera experience. While you don’t get the same levels of zoom quality as you do on Galaxy Note 20, or the same resolution main sensor as on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, the Galaxy S20 FE still delivers a versatile, high-quality camera experience.The phone offers three camera sensors, including one 12-megapixel standard sensor, one 8MP sensor with a telephoto lens, and one 12MP sensor with an ultra-wide lens. I really appreciate that, and while some prefer either a telephoto or ultra-wide over the other, simply having both means that the camera is useful in all kinds of situations.On paper, the specs aren’t quite up to the standard Galaxy S20, but photos seemed to be pretty much as good in day to day use. They’re still colorful and crisp, with enough dynamic range to make for a punchy photo, but not so much as to wander into unnatural territory. These days, photo quality may have more to do with post-processing than sensor quality, so it makes sense that the slightly inferior specs don’t really make for much worse photos than the Galaxy S20.In low light, photos are pretty good. As is expected, really low light photos can get noisy, but generally speaking, the phone is good at capturing enough detail to make for decent shots. The same is true of really zoomed-in photos. The telephoto camera offers 3x optical zoom and up to 10x digital zoom — and as a result, you’ll get up to 30x hybrid zoom. Photos at that level of zoom aren’t as crisp, obviously, but Samsung has been seriously investing in cleaning up zoomed shots on its photos, and it shows. The 3-10x shots are solid, but you’ll rarely care to use 30x.The selfie cam looks pretty solid too. The front-facing camera is 32MP, and it doesn’t have the dual phase detection autofocus found on the original Galaxy S20, but it still captured colorful selfies with more than enough detail. The higher resolution selfie cam is here for a reason — when you’re not using the wide-angle sensor, it really just crops the image, and as a result, the photo is just lower resolution.One feature that is missing from the Galaxy S20 FE is the ability to record video in 8K. That’s because you need a higher resolution camera to do so. Still, the camera can record 4K video at 60 frames per second, which should be more than enough for most, and will save you from maxing out your storage.Powering it all is a 4,500mAh battery, which seemed to be able to get through a full day of use without issue. I ended a day of heavy use with around 20% of the battery remaining, which isn’t a ton, but it’s still fine. If you’re used to charging your phone every night, you shouldn’t have any issues.Thankfully, the phone is easy to charge too. Unlike the OnePlus 8, this phone does support wireless charging — plus, you’ll get 25W wired fast charging. At this point, I have wireless chargers dotted around my house, so it was nice to be able to take advantage of them while testing this phone.As you would expect, the Galaxy S20 FE comes with Samsung’s One UI 2.5, which is Android 10. I’m not going to dive into the ins and outs of the Android customizations — you can read comprehensive takes in our Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 reviews — but I will say that the bloatware seems to have been pared back a little on this phone compared to some others. That’s mostly because of the fact that you can select which apps are installed on your device out of the box, and while all the extra Samsung apps and Microsoft apps are checked by default, simply taking the extra few moments to customize the pre-installs when you set your phone up is worth it.Generally, the software was responsive and smooth. Love or hate One UI, Samsung has done a good job at making it cohesive throughout the interface, and easy to use with one hand. Samsung also wins for customizability, so if you really like to tweak and theme, you’ll enjoy the experience here.The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE puts the flagship phone experience in a $700 phone. You’re really not missing much here. Sure, a 1440p display resolution is always nice, and some of the camera specs don’t reach the heights of the standard Galaxy S20, Note 20, or new Galaxy S21. But with a premium processor, still awesome display, premium feel, and great camera system, you can’t do much better in the price range.I would have liked if Samsung had released this phone alongside the rest of the Galaxy S20 lineup, but it makes sense why it didn’t in order to capture those high-dollar sales first. That said, if Samsung intends to continue releasing phones of this quality in this price range, the likes of OnePlus should be very worried.It depends on what you’re looking for. The OnePlus 8 is the main competitor here, and while it’s a great phone, it doesn’t quite have the same camera quality, it doesn’t reach the 120Hz display refresh rate, and it doesn’t have wireless charging. But OnePlus does deliver a cleaner and arguably better software experience. It could also be a toss-up between the Google Pixel 5 or OnePlus 8 as the primary competitor.If you’re really on a budget, it’s also worth considering the Pixel 4a or waiting for the Pixel 4a 5G. They have amazing cameras and simpler software, though the specs and performance don’t match the Galaxy S20 FE, nor do the displays.Of course, if you’re not married to Android, it’s also worth considering the iPhone 11, which comes at a similar price, has even better performance, and an awesome camera. That said, you won’t get the same display. Nor will you get 5G, and you’ll have to deal with the iPhone notch.Last but not least, the Galaxy S21 series is now here, but while the Galaxy S21 will offer better performance, it’s also more expensive — and arguably not worth the extra cash.With the Snapdragon 865 and IP68 water resistance, the Galaxy S20 FE should easily last through a normal two-year phone cycle, and longer if you want or need it to. The plastic back helps here too — while it doesn’t feel as premium, it does help ensure that the phone is more likely to remain crack-free throughout its lifespan.Yes. Sure, you could spend another $300 for a marginally better phone, but if you want flagship-level quality for $700, this is currently the phone to beat.If you’re on the hunt for lower prices for smartphones, here are the best Samsung Galaxy deals and best smartphone deals currently available."
43,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date/,"If I were Motorola, I’d be pretty worried right now.Samsung’s horizontally folding Galaxy Z flip new smartphone looks better than Motorola’s Razr in every way. Samsung’s had this on the roadmap since the company’s first folding-screen smartphone, the Galaxy Fold, but the Z Flip isn’t replacing the Fold, as it very well could for many customers who might’ve been considering the Motorola Razr.“We see the folding category as splitting two ways,” Caleb Slavin, Senior Manager of Smartphone Product Strategy at Samsung, told Digital Trends. “The flip style is more about having that really compact form factor, really easy to fit in your pocket, more of a style-focused device.”Inevitably, the Galaxy Fold felt like a tablet; the Z Flip feels like the future. It’s the same feeling I got when I first held the new Motorola Razr, but one thing immediately stands out above the Razr — and that’s build quality.It starts with the in-hand feel. The Galaxy Z Flip feels like a flagship Galaxy phone that was literally folded in half. Picking it up, you’ll immediately feel the well-balanced weight of the phone, which thankfully carries over when it’s flipped open. The aluminum and glass that compose the Z Flip somehow feels sturdier than the stainless-steel Motorola Razr, partially due to the resin back and plastic screen used on the Razr. The Z Flip also uses foldable glass to protect the display — a touch that significantly bumps up the look and feel.Samsung refers to it as “Samsung Ultra Thin Glass” but doesn’t offer much in the way of details, other than boasts about its durability. While we can’t quite test that yet, it’s clear that there’s much less separation between the glass, frame, and hinge keeping this intersection neat, tidy, and less prone to damage. All of these were issues for Samsung’s first foldable phone, the Galaxy Fold, upon its initial release, and though we’ll have to see how foldable glass holds up, we’re happy to see it and the structural improvements around it.The Z Flip is a flashy device too, with mirror finishes in each color option (mirror purple, mirror gold, and mirror black) that make up the front and back of the device, which sort of looks like a makeup compact when closed. The only interruption in the closed façade is the dual-camera setup and a teeny-tiny 1-inch OLED touchscreen that takes up about just as much space. The small touchscreen can answer or reject calls, show the time and date, and display other quick notifications; it doubles as a viewfinder for taking selfies. It’s a very small viewfinder, but it’s workable, considering a selfie can only go as far as your arm can reach.Prying the Z Flip open, you’ll feel some satisfying resistance which you can fidget with nervously, partially opening and closing the device without much worry. Samsung says this hinge is tested for over 200,000 full open-and-close motions. Good resistance carries through the range of motion on the hinge, which is great for avoiding a floppy feel, but still doesn’t give you the spring-loaded satisfaction that yesteryear’s snap-open flip phones gave us — something the new Motorola Razr also couldn’t nail.Fully unfurled, we’re looking at a 6.7-inch AMOLED display and a slightly tall 21.9:9 aspect ratio. The height isn’t anything you’ll look at twice, as you might with Sony’s Xperia 10, for instance, and the bezels surrounding it are small enough to keep the device feeling normal in hand. There is a noticeable crease in the middle where the display bends, but if you’re looking straight on at the device, it’ll be hard to find.Samsung added a few bits to the Z Flip’s UI that prove it wasn’t just relying on the form-factor to carry this experience through. It’s not a lot, but there are small, welcome additions like Flex Mode, which detects when the phone is half-open and separates the UI into two screens for certain apps. For instance, if you open the phone to about a 90-degree angle, launch the camera app, and set the Z Flip on the table, not only do you essentially have a tripod setup, but the bottom half of the screen becomes strictly controls (shutter button, mode switch, etc.) while the top half becomes a dedicated viewfinder. This also works with the Gallery app, which makes the bottom half a touchpad of sorts for swiping through photos on the top half of the screen, and YouTube, which separates videos from the comments and information section.They’re not the most useful features in the world of tech, but at least the tripod proposition adds some value while the rest simply add a bit of fun and novelty.When it comes to performance, the Z Flip isn’t the supercharged powerhouse that the Galaxy S20 Ultra aims to be, but I’m happy to report you won’t be lacking for power either. Equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 Plus processor with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage, the Z Flip’s chipset is a small step above most 2019 flagships. There’s also no option for expandable memory, but if these are the minor sacrifices needed to either keep price down, battery life up, or the profile thin, then I’m more than pleased with the decision. With a 3,300 mAh battery and the option to charge wirelessly or share power wirelessly to other devices, all sounds up to snuff here, but day-long battery life is an important aspect we’ll need to confirm after some more time with the device.On the subject of small sacrifices, we’re not getting big boisterous camera arrangements on the Z Flip but rather a pair of 12 MP wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle cameras. This more modest setup should still yield some alluring results, as they’re the same optics you’ll find on the brand-new Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus. So, really the only thing you’re missing from Samsung’s latest camera tech is the telephoto 3× zoom camera.Motorola just released the new Razr last week, and it couldn’t have come at a worse time. If a compact foldable smartphone is your thing, you can spend less than the $1,500 Verizon exclusive — albeit only about $100 less, $1,380 — and get a better horizontally-folding phone, with more carrier choice, in Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip. When I say “better,” I mean in just about every way. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, design, durability, and performance are not. Although we’ll need to see how some of those metrics finish out over time, Samsung has a very strong head start with a foldable phone that feels like a no-compromise flagship device.The Galaxy Z Flip will be available in select stores and online at Samsung.com starting February 14."
44,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-review/,"Foldables are going to play a role in the future of smartphones. Even if they seem expensive, fragile, and compromised right now, they won’t be forever. Just seeing the progression in quality from the first Galaxy Fold, which had a horrendous launch, to the quality of the Galaxy Z Fold 2 indicates that the industry is headed in the right direction.But you don’t buy a foldable phone, particularly one that’s $2,000, because it’s part of a progression of new technology. You buy it because of what it does for you right now, and what it offers beyond what you get from a regular smartphone. Here’s everything the Galaxy Z Fold 2 brings to the table to justify its sky-high price.The new Galaxy Z Fold 2 follows the same concept as its predecessor: A mini tablet-sized device, bisected by a big hinge, with a folding screen on the inside and an additional “cover display” on the outside. But it’s not hyperbole to say that Samsung has touched every bit of the execution of that concept for this generation. And it’s all for the better.Samsung knows how to make high-end phones that look and feel like they’re worth the money, and that carries over to this giant device. The two-tone matte glass and glossy metal pieces give the Z Fold 2 quite a bit of flair, and while I like it (you’re never going to be able to hide this phone anyway), black is an option too. The execution is, well, pristine. Every angle is perfect, every gap is consistent, and all of the details are spot-on.The redesigned hinge is most responsible for the Z Fold 2’s robust feel. It’s no longer loose or flimsy at any point of its operation, because it holds tight at any angle, like a laptop screen or a Microsoft Surface kickstand. You can set the screen angle anywhere you want, and it just stays — but it still retains a satisfying lock when it opens flat. With the screen open, you can hold the phone in one hand, shake it around, hold it vertically or upside down, and it doesn’t budge.It’s also relatively easy to pop it back to a folded position with one hand — so long as you’re comfortable pressing your thumb on the screen. It closes with a solid, satisfying “click” as the bezels snap together with magnets. Whether you’re opening or closing, there’s barely a noise to be heard. Obviously, if you hold your ear to the screen you’ll notice the various layers unfurl, and the little dust-busting bristles in the hinge, but this is a nearly silent operation.Samsung overhauled the hardware execution, and took both displays to a new level.Even if Samsung had kept the exterior design identical to its predecessor, I’d still applaud its improved display. The cover display was comically small before, but is now 6.2 inches with small bezels, like any other smartphone. Bigger changes were made inside, with the 7.6 inch foldable panel now surrounded by 25% smaller bezels and a simple hole punch camera rather than the huge multi-camera notch before. The bezel edges aren’t raised nearly as much, and you barely notice them even as you use Android 10’s gesture-navigation system.The display looks amazing. Of course it does, it’s a Samsung display. Colors are saturated, brightness is excellent even outdoors, and there’s no variation when viewed at an angle. It even runs at a 120Hz refresh rate, just like the S20 series, so motion is buttery smooth. With the flexible display layers, clarity isn’t on the same level as glass-covered panels on the iPhone 11 Pro Max or Samsung’s own Note 20 Ultra. But aside from that slight visual change, this display is indistinguishable from the best in the industry — it’s just double the size, and happens to fold in half. No compromise here.Let’s talk about the crease. It’s there, and yes, you’re going to notice it. Sometimes. It’s most noticeable with the screen at low brightness and on white or light backgrounds. Still, after a few days, I found my eyes ignoring it. And given that you’re mostly using the phone in portrait mode — the display has a very wide aspect ratio anyway — you’re rarely touching or swiping across the crease.Most people are more worried about durability, though. I only used the Z Fold 2 for two weeks for this review, and as such I can’t say how well it’ll hold up over time. But I’m rather confident in it, particularly as we’ve now seen people use the original Fold (well, the revised original fold) for a year with little degradation. This new model has Samsung’s “UTG,” or Ultra Thin Glass, covering for the display, and it’s much more resistant to scratches and impacts. There’s also a preinstalled screen protector made of the typical thin flexible plastic, which I’m not a big fan of, but it’s another layer of protection.The crease is definitely going to change shape a bit and pick up some aberrations over months of folding. And, yes, if you dig your fingernail into the screen or drop it while it’s open, it’s going to look worse for the wear. But most phones will be damaged in the latter scenario, and the Z Fold 2’s biggest upside is that when you’re not using it, the foldable screen is closed and unable to be impacted. There are usability concerns with a big foldable phone like this, but for me, they don’t relate to the screen and hinge’s longevity.Samsung has made strides in getting this hardware to be as sleek and compact as current technology allows, but it’s still a behemoth compared to single-screen non-folding phones. That starts with the weight, 282 grams, which is about 25% heavier than an iPhone 11 Pro Max and 35% heavier than a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. It continues with the thickness, nearly 17 mm, which is roughly double that of a typical phone (as you’d expect).It adds up to an unwieldy device. It’s big and heavy, and you never forget that — not in your hand, nor in your pocket. The phone isn’t even close to being small enough for me to run with as a music source for my headphones, in any sort of pouch or holder. It’s also not water resistant, so I wouldn’t take the chance anyway.The weight is most noticeable when it’s closed, which is how you’ll use it often. Thankfully, the new, larger cover display is big enough to get most tasks done, with full access to a typical lock screen, notifications, home screen, and all of your apps. The screen is a little on the narrow side, which can make typing awkward (this can be remedied with a swiping keyboard), but the main issue is reaching the top of this very-tall screen while balancing a hefty and thick phone.The other issue you run into is app compatibility. Some apps just don’t scale to the full screen, because it’s so tall. That’s more of an annoyance than a true usability problem, but it’s there. Most of these nonconforming apps are the same ones that need to be force-restarted when you open the phone while they’re running, an odd quirk of the way Android apps resize (or don’t).But you don’t use the exterior display any more than you need to, because you can open up the Z Fold 2 and get that glorious panel instead. The use cases are all easy to understand. It starts with simply getting more of everything. More map area, more webpage before scrolling, more photos at a larger size, more of each message in a list, more book before turning the page, and so on. That’s great, because you never feel cramped on the Z Fold 2 — there’s always enough space to do what you want.Once again, that requires the apps you use to play ball, though. Many apps, including all of Google’s and Microsoft’s, use that extra real estate well when running full-screen. You get an extra panel, or appropriately sized interface controls, giving you more content and less chrome. Other apps are just bad. Twitter, Seamless, Venmo, Strava, Telegram, Lyft, American Express, the list goes on. All of them just stretch out the interface and give you no more content or viewing area, because they haven’t been designed with large screens in mind. Instagram is notoriously bad at filling the screen, and now Samsung just has it pillar-boxed so it’s at least somewhat usable. (It’s still bad.)Samsung also utilizes the stiff hinge to let you prop up the phone at an angle in “flex mode,” which triggers a different interface in a handful of apps — YouTube, Google Duo, camera, and a few others, While it demos well, it’s not very useful. Why cut the screen in half? I only found use for it for video calls when I didn’t want to hold the phone, or staged photos where I used it as a de facto tripod.Most of the time, you’re running a single app on the Z Fold 2, and it feels clunky and like a waste of space. You really have to find the handful of apps that use that space well, and stick to those. But of course, you can also run side-by-side apps, which dramatically improves the experience. It’s immediately intuitive and extremely useful. Run Twitter while you’re writing messages, check the status of an order while you look at the charge on your credit card, run a Wikipedia search while you’re watching a YouTube video. Check your calendar while reading an email.It’s this double-app use where the Z Fold 2 shines and truly justifies its size. You can set up app pairs (or groups of three, if you really want) to auto-launch together with a single tap. Or if you already have a full-screen app open, you can drag in a second, third, or floating app at any time using a small handle on the side of the screen. Roughly 90% of my apps were able to be run side-by-side — not perfect, but close.If you’re not regularly opening up the Z Fold 2 and using multiple apps at once, you’re really missing the point of this phone. You don’t pay this much, and deal with this big of a device, just to use the cover display or a single app on the inside. You need to utilize its capabilities.Samsung gives the Z Fold 2 more than enough horsepower to run three apps at once. You won’t have to think for a moment that the phone has a Snapdragon 865+, 12GB of RAM, or 5G — it all works just like every high-end phone should, and will for years to come. You’ll appreciate the 256GB of storage, though, as well as the nice-to-have features like stereo speakers, fast charging, fast wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging. There’s no compromise in specs or features compared to non-folding phones, which isn’t a given in foldables right now.If you’re not regularly using multiple apps at once, you’re really missing the point of this phone.Battery life is nearly on par with leading single-screen phones, but longevity heavily depends on how you use it. With lots of main screen use and multitasking, you can chew through the 4,500mAh battery (same as the Note 20 Ultra) before you know it. It’s not surprising that when you enable yourself to watch video more often and run two apps constantly, it’s going to take up resources. But in my typical use, translating what I usually do over to the bigger screen, I made it through a full day with 10 to 20% battery to spare.Unlike the Microsoft Surface Duo, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 doesn’t come with major camera compromises — thankfully so. You get a triumvirate of cameras, loosely based on the Galaxy S20: The same main 12-megapixel camera with OIS (optical image stabilization) is paired with two smaller 12MP sensors for zoom and ultrawide applications.It’s slightly disappointing that this $2,000 phone doesn’t have a carbon copy of the camera setup from the Galaxy S20+ (or Note 20 Ultra, for that matter). But where things matter the most, the main camera, you get an identical experience. These photos speak for themselves, folks: This is a really good camera.Just like Samsung’s 2020 flagships, the Z Fold 2 takes punchy, colorful, and eye-pleasing photos. I never took a downright bad shot, and the camera is dead-reliable and consistent every time I double-press the power key to launch it. There’s a tendency for too much saturation, and sometimes the sky can be blown out or generate heavy halo effects around objects, but those are small quibbles.The zoom camera is a bit of a letdown, as it’s a smaller sensor and lacks OIS found in the main camera (and on the Galaxy S20’s zoom camera). You can easily tell that zoom shots are softer than the main camera, even at just 2X, and in low-light scenes the software switches back to the main sensor entirely. This zoom camera harks back to the Galaxy S10 series, and today’s midrange phones, and that’s not good to see at this price. The ultrawide camera absolutely gets the job done, even if it isn’t the exact same as the one on the S20 and Note 20 series.And no matter the camera you choose, shooting with a gigantic viewfinder on the opened screen is even better than a typical phone.Perhaps the biggest camera win of all is for selfies. You can turn around the Z Fold 2 and use the rear camera as a selfie shooter with the Cover Display as a viewfinder. Whether you want a super-high-quality main camera shot, or an ultrawide for a group of friends (or some scenery by yourself), this blows away any typical front-facing camera — particularly in low light.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is a huge progression from the original. The hardware is crafted perfectly and exudes quality, while the functionality of the screens and hinge have been dramatically improved. This all comes without many compromises in the core smartphone experience — you get good cameras and most “nice-to-have” features from a regular phone.The downsides are usability, size, and price. The Z Fold 2 is huge, making it tough to use one-handed at times — and if you’re not using that big display constantly, it feels like a chore to carry around this massive device. At the same time, many of the software experiences when you have that screen open leave something to be desired. And then, there’s the price. At $2,000, you need a lot of loose cash to be willing to spend double that of a typical high-end phone, but not get double the functionality or features.This is an amazing technological feat, but it still requires an understanding that you’re buying a folding smartphone on the absolute bleeding edge of innovation. That means there are compromises to be had, and that’s not what most people want (or need).There really is no direct alternative to the Galaxy Z Fold 2. Some will say the Microsoft Surface Duo is a loose competitor, but it really offers a different experience with its separated displays — and ultimately, the Surface Duo massively misses the mark in features and core smartphone usability.Elsewhere in the foldable space, your options are Samsung’s own Galaxy Z Flip or the forthcoming Motorola Razr, both of which offer entirely different experiences. Realistically, your choice is this: Do you buy a Galaxy Z Fold 2, or spend top dollar on a “traditional” high-end phone like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra or upcoming iPhone 12 Pro Max? It’s a personal decision.Want to know more about Samsung products? Check out our review on Samsung Galaxy S21.I’m not particularly worried about the long-term durability of the hinge and display on the Z Fold 2. Samsung has clearly put a ton of work into addressing early hardware flaws, and even last year’s Fold has shown to be rather durable over time. Samsung also provides good warranty protection and screen replacement services if needed. The Z Fold 2 will also receive at least two major software upgrades and regular security patches, which will support it about as long as anyone will actually use the phone.Yes. People are going to scoff at the Z Fold 2’s $2,000 price tag, and rightfully so. But if you’re willing to part with that large sum of money for the latest technology, chances are you may also be interested in being an early adopter of foldable phones. The Z Fold 2 is the best foldable on the (small) market right now.But if you do buy it, please don’t finance the phone over four years as Samsung suggests on its website."
45,Sony Xperia 1 II,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-1-ii-review/,"Sony is doing its utmost to make devices that don’t conform with the 2020 smartphone rules. The Xperia 1 II (yes, that’s “one two,” as in the sequel to the Xperia 1) isn’t a curvy all-screen phone, it doesn’t have an in-display fingerprint sensor, and to get the most from the camera, it expects you to know your camera tech already. It does follow the herd with the price though, coming in at a hefty $1,200.It’s refreshing to use a phone that’s not a clone of another this year, but while Sony gets a lot right, the direction it takes in its effort to make the phone stand out is a little too niche. Let’s look at it in more detail.The Xperia 1 II’s look will split opinion, but I think it looks excellent. It uses a 21:9 aspect ratio screen, giving it an elongated, more-tall-than-wide style, and has square- off sides for a boxy, monolithic shape. The black, high-gloss finish on my review phone is classy if a little faceless, and the build quality and construction are superb.You’d expect that, right? Of course, but it stands out here. While the sides of the phone are flat, the glass on the front and back has a 2D curve on all sides, and it beautifully and seamlessly blends into the chassis. It’s like the phone has been expertly hewn from a single block of black glass.On the back is a vertical camera lens module in the left corner. It’s so densely packed with sensors that two wouldn’t fit inside, spilling out onto the body itself. Down the right-hand side is a volume rocker, and a power button that also houses the fingerprint sensor. Below this is a two-stage dedicated camera shutter button. More on these later.On the opposite side is Sony’s easy-open SIM card tray. It doesn’t need a special tool to extract from the body, making it easier to live with for those who regularly change SIMs or MicroSD cards on the move. It’s also considerably more secure than the one I used on the Xperia 10 Plus, which was too easy to pull out of the phone.Lightweight at 181 grams and slim at 7.9mm, the Xperia 1 II doesn’t have the curves of the OnePlus 8 Pro, or the slick form of the Huawei P40 Pro, but it does have comfort, grip, and class. The 21:9 aspect ratio means the body isn’t too wide to hold and use with one hand, the glass isn’t slippery, and there’s a cool simplicity to the design that means it’ll still look good in a year’s time.What an absolute beauty the screen on the Xperia 1 II is — exactly what you’d expect from a company that makes some of the best televisions out there. (Have you seen the new A8H 4K OLED? It’s superb.) The Xperia’s screen measures 6.5-inches and is an HDR-capable OLED panel with an amazing 3,840 × 1,644 pixel resolution. That’s a pixel density of 643ppi — for comparison, even the beautiful iPhone 11 Pro only manages 458ppi.To call it simply sharp is an understatement. It’s glorious in ways a smartphone screen doesn’t really need to be. I experimented with wallpapers, videos, and images online and from my own gallery, and it never disappointed. From the inky blacks — set the Dark Mode to really appreciate its depth — to its unwillingness to show even a single pixel, and viewing anything and everything is a joy. This is also where the flat screen pays dividends, as the screen appears to be right on the surface of the glass.Dig into the settings and you can change the white balance or activate Creator Mode, which tunes the visuals through a special color gamut and 10-bit HDR. It’s created with the help of Sony’s CineAlta team, which is usually busy working on video cameras that shoot the latest blockbuster movies. Sony has also added a video enhancement mode and a motion blur reduction mode. Both are effective, but the look won’t be for everyone. Motion blur, for example, does indeed smooth out video playback on YouTube, but at the expense of realism.Carfection’s 4K resolution video review of the Alpine A110S on YouTube really plays to the Xperia 1 II’s strengths. The level of detail is fantastic, right down to reading the tire brand and sizes even at a distance, and the color balance is exemplary. If I have a criticism, it’s that the palette is quite cool, so whites can be rather stark at high brightness, but activating Creator Mode can improve this.Colorful, vibrant, and extremely customizable, it’s probably the best phone screen I’ve seen. What a great shame it doesn’t have a 90 or 120Hz refresh rate, a feature many would consider a staple on any 2020 flagship phone.Here’s a rundown of the cameras on the Xperia 1 II. You get a standard 12-megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS), a 12-megapixel wide-angle sensor, and a 12-megapixel telephoto with OIS. It has a 3D time-of-flight sensor, a flash, a photo light, and Sony’s highly accurate eye-tracking tech. Camera expert Zeiss provides the lenses, and there’s a 3× optical zoom, HDR, 4K HDR video recording at up to 60 frames per second (fps), and a 20 fps burst mode, too.Sony has also preinstalled two custom camera apps, Cinema Pro and Photo Pro, which emulate the user interface and features found on Alpha cameras such as the Sony A9 and Sony A7 III. Sony has continued to utilize expertise from within, and wants its smartphone cameras to be an extension of its pro-level equipment, providing a similar level of versatility in a compact, portable device. As a strategy, it makes perfect sense; in reality, it’s still something that regular phone buyers may never get to grips with.Take the Cinema Pro app. It gives you complete control over how you shoot video on the Xperia 1 II, from the focus to the shutter speed, the white balance, the ISO, and even the overall look of your footage. I’ve no doubt that if you’re well-versed in using a pro-level camera to shoot video, the features will be clear and you’ll be shooting top-quality video immediately. If you’re like me, someone who leaves the camera on Auto, then the learning curve is very steep and you’ll shoot a lot of rubbish video before arriving at something halfway decent. The thing is, you could just shoot using the normal camera app and cut out all the sweat and swearing that comes from trying to wrangle Cinema Pro’s settings correctly.Photo Pro and Cinema Pro are too complex for regular phone buyers, but it’s great to see Sony working to differentiate its devices from others by utilizing its massive internal expertise, and there will be a section of the buying audience that loves the granular control provided by these apps. Does it impact the usability of the normal camera on the Xperia 1 II? Thankfully, no. You can confidently use the phone’s regular camera app and take great-looking, shareable photos in most environments.It’s not too heavy-handed with the saturation, so photos appear natural but have enough pop that you’ll want to share them without editing. There’s plenty of versatility with the wide-angle and 3× optical zoom too, and the physical, two-stage focus/shutter release button works brilliantly. I did notice some haloing in bright sunlight in some photos, and it’s not great in low light. The selfie camera can also take washed-out, lifeless photos to boot. For the most part, the camera is good, but I think you need to really understand photography and should learn to use the Pro apps to get the best from it.Here’s where Sony starts to lose points on the fundamentals. The app is poorly designed for a start. For example, the button to flip to the selfie camera is hidden in the menu at the top of the screen, so you have to search for it. It’s also a little slow: There’s a noticeable pause when switching between lenses and when snapping a photo. This is basic stuff, and frustrating on a high-end phone from an experienced manufacturer. Switching to a better camera app might help.The Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 and 8GB of RAM power the Xperia 1 II, with 256GB of storage space and a slot for either a MicroSD card or a second SIM in that handy, quick-release tray on the side. The phone also has UFS 3.0 for fast memory access (in layman’s terms, it means storage performance is closer to SSDs, but with longer battery life). This is all in line with what we’d expect from a flagship smartphone, and it was as fast and smooth as you’d expect.Geekbench 5: 895 Single Core/3287 Multi Core3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 6,062 (Vulkan)These scores are a little lower than the OnePlus 8 Pro, and lower on 3DMark than the Exynos-powered Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, although the Xperia does beat it on Geekbench 5. I didn’t notice any performance deficit. I like gaming on the Xperia 1 II. I played mostly casual games, spending way too much time on Hill Climb Racer, mostly because the phone is very comfortable to hold in landscape orientation. The widescreen 21:9 aspect ratio looks great, the screen is incredibly sharp, and I didn’t really miss a higher refresh rate either. When playing more graphically intensive games like Real Racing 3, the phone copes superbly and never gets hot.Despite the Sony phone having a 5G-ready Snapdragon 865 processor, 5G is disabled in the U.S. It’s active in the U.K. version, but I couldn’t test the feature out due to 5G not being available in my area. Not having 5G in a phone at this price does impact its long-term appeal. Calls all sounded good, although reception was slightly problematic, with the phone not pulling in a strong signal compared to others. The phone also has a tendency to get quite hot when on longer calls, but against your palm rather than your face.My review phone has Android 10 with the July 1 Android Security Patch installed. It also has Sony’s own user interface over the top, which is very similar to Google’s Pixel-branded software. Gestures work well, there’s an effective Dark mode, and the notification shade and app drawer are where you expect them to be. I didn’t have any problems with speed, but I was sometimes frustrated by apps taking a while to close after swiping to exit.There are a few too many preinstalled apps, including LinkedIn, which send prompts to use them when you start using the phone. This is also true of Sony’s own apps, such as its News Suite app, which isn’t very attractive and is populated by too many sponsored stories to be useful. Many other manufacturers have abandoned this practice, or at least provide the option of preinstalling these moneymaking recommended apps during setup. It’s annoying Sony doesn’t do the same.The 4,000mAh battery lasts for about five to five-and-a-half hours of screen time each day. This meant outside of very heavy days of use, it managed a full 8 a.m. to midnight stretch before needing a recharge. It’s acceptable, but not great. The fingerprint sensor is the same — acceptable but not great. It’s unreliable and quite awkward to use, because it’s smaller than the side sensors used on previous Sony phones. It doesn’t like wet fingers either. All this is made more annoying by the lack of face unlock to fall back on.Sony has put stereo front-facing speakers on the Xperia 1 II, and they’re excellent, with a full, deep, and engaging sound. Audio is enhanced with a feature called Dynamic Vibration, which uses haptic motors to add a vibration to media played on the phone. It operates in many apps including YouTube and Twitter, and is surprisingly effective. It can get a little too much during music videos, where it just constantly vibrates, but is quite fun on movies. Best of all, you can adjust the intensity or turn it off completely if you don’t like it, right from the volume panel.The excellent audio performance combined with the stunning screen make the Xperia 1 II a superb multimedia phone.The Xperia 1 II costs $1,199 in the U.S. and is available now from Sony, Amazon, and other retailers. In the U.K., the Xperia 1 II costs 1,099 British pounds.The Sony Xperia 1 II is something a little different, and that instantly makes me warm to it. The screen is one of the best in the business, the camera takes some great photos, and the quality of the phone itself is superb. I also appreciate Sony’s attempts to make the Xperia 1 II stand out from the crowd. But the complex, pro-level camera apps have very niche appeal, and the decision not to include 5G in the U.S. models is as baffling as it is unfortunate.Yes. If you want a top-spec Android phone with a good camera, we recommend either the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus or S20 Ultra, depending on your budget, or suggest you go take a look at the Galaxy Note 10 Plus or the new Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. The OnePlus 8 Pro is also highly recommended, and is considerably cheaper. If you’re in the U.K. or don’t mind importing, then the Oppo Find X2 Pro is also excellent.Our other suggestion here is to buy an iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max. The camera is excellent, and if you want pro-level tools. there are many apps available in the App Store to replicate Sony’s Cinema and Video Pro app functionality. You’re getting our recommendation of the best overall phone you can buy today as a bonus, but be aware that it too does not come with 5G. For that, you’ll have to wait for the iPhone 12, which arrives in the fall.The Xperia 1 II has an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, giving it a good chance of survival if things take a turn for the damp, and the Gorilla Glass 6 both front and back is durable. My review model did pick up a couple of faint scratches on the screen simply by spending a relatively short amount of time in pockets and bags. A screen protector and a case would be advisable.While the lack of 5G in the U.S. version isn’t a big deal for everyone right now, it will become an increasingly desirable feature over the next two years, which is the minimum amount of time we’d expect you to keep this phone, and not having it as an option may be a problem. We advise you to think carefully whether you’re likely to want 5G in the near future, and purchase accordingly.Sony has not said when Android 11 will arrive on the Xperia 1 II. When we checked about ongoing software updates more generally, we were told, “Sony Mobile is providing regular and timely security upgrades. While phones cannot be upgraded indefinitely, we provide security upgrades within the industry standard on our devices, depending on regions and carriers.”No. Despite its strengths, you can buy a phone with similar features that has 5G on board and is ready for the future. When you spend $1,199 on a phone, you expect it to have the very latest tech to guarantee longevity. In the U.K., where the phone does have 5G, the Xperia 1 II becomes a better choice."
46,Sony Xperia 5 II,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-5-ii-review/,"The Sony Xperia 5 II is the compact flagship smartphone many have been hankering for, but to get the best from this desirable high-spec/small-package combination, you will have to work hard and pay a substantial price. I’ve been living with the phone for a couple of weeks now, and this is what it’s really like.Glossy, glassy, and slippery like a well-oiled fish. That’s the best way to describe the Xperia 5 II, outside of its modest dimensions and low weight. It’s truly compact, due to the 8mm thickness and taller-not-wider shape enabled by the 21:9 aspect ratio screen. It weighs only 163 grams, and the slim build means even those with small hands will be able to reach the other side of the screen with their thumb. It easily slips into pockets and bags, and unfortunately, off of nearly every surface it touches as well.The Xperia 5 II is made from glass with an aluminum frame, and it slides around with a mind of its own on anything that’s not a perfectly flat surface. You also have to hold on tightly because of this, as there’s not much grip from the body. This brings me to the one thing I really dislike about the phone’s design — a mass of buttons running down the right-hand side.Top-to-bottom, there’s a small volume rocker, then the power button with the fingerprint sensor built in, then a Google Assistant button, and finally, a physical camera shutter button. Pick the Xperia 5 II up and it’s almost certain you’ll press a button, and it’s usually the useless Google Assistant one, which can’t be remapped or easily disabled. A frustrating design choice, made worse by not giving me the option to use the function or not.The fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable, but it is set a little too centrally on the side in my opinion, and I do like the physical camera shutter button, which is placed at the bottom of the frame so as not to intrude. It’s great to find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of the frame, despite the phone’s slimness. I like the pullout SIM card tray, which doesn’t require the use of a SIM removal tool, yet doesn’t affect the phone’s IP68 water-resistance rating.The Sony Xperia 5 II is easy to handle, compact enough for everyone, made from premium materials, and just about the perfect size for a smartphone. You’ll just have to deal with all the slipperiness.The 21:9 aspect ratio is made for watching super-widescreen movies, and contributes to the phone’s diminutive size. In reality, although 21:9 films are out there, they’re a little less common than 16:9 videos. This means you’ll still watch most with black bars running down either side, although there are plenty of games that take advantage of the super-widescreen view, including Minecraft, Asphalt 9, and Fortnite.It’s the spec we want in 2020, though. The OLED screen has a 2520 x 1080 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 10-bit HDR support. It’s not the 4K monster fitted to the Xperia 1 II, but under normal circumstances, you really won’t notice the lower pixel count, plus it has the same Creator Mode and image-enhancement technology from the more expensive phone. I love the way it looks, and doubt many will wish they’d splurged to get the Xperia 1 II instead.The display is lovely. Dreamy, in fact. Carfection’s Audi e-Tron Sportback review is sharp and colorful, while Mnet’s live version of WJSN Chocome’s Hmph! jumps off the screen with its electrified, ultra-vivid colors. Music videos are excellent on the Xperia 5 II due to its stereo speakers, which have masses of volume and a sweet controlled sound. And Sony’s Dynamic Vibration feature adds a vibration matched to what’s playing on the screen. It works well because you can adjust the intensity. Keep it low and it’s a pleasing additional effect.And when you’re using the phone vertically, as you do most of the time, that extra screen real estate gives you more content in feeds and messaging apps without having to scroll.No, the Xperia 5 II doesn’t quite reach the heights of the Xperia 1 II in terms of sheer, astonishing visual appeal on a mobile device, but it’s arguably all anyone will need.There are three 12-megapixel cameras on the back of the Xperia 5 II: An f/1.7 standard camera, an f/2.4 telephoto camera, and an f/2.2 ultrawide camera. Sony worked with Zeiss Optics on the lenses, and features include optical and electronic image stabilization, HDR, 4K video recording, eye-tracking, a 3x optical zoom, and Dual Pixel autofocus. It’s almost the same setup found on the back of the Xperia 1 II, but with a few alterations.Because its so similar to the Xperia 1 II, it has the same problems. The photos it takes are often beautiful, with excellent balance and dynamic range, but it struggles with focus up-close, and results can be inconsistent. It doesn’t have a night mode for super-bright night images, so lowlight images aren’t as striking as those taken with some other phones, but there’s plenty of realism and detail. The 8MP selfie camera washes skin tone out to the point of death on the default settings, so it’s wise to turn off all the enhancements before getting started there.Overall, I’d edit my images more often than not, a process that uses Google Photos editing suite, to get them looking just right. It’s worth it, because Sony’s camera captures plenty of delicious detail. I didn’t get a chance to play with the eye-tracking feature on the Xperia 5 II due to a lack of living creatures around me (thanks 2020), but I’ve used it in the past and been very impressed. Getting eye focus right is crucial to accurately capturing portrait shots, and it’s a feature few other phones have.Sony sells the Xperia cameras on the merits of its Photo Pro and Cinema Pro apps, which have been tuned by Sony’s expert camera and cinema teams, and are essentially jazzed-up manual modes. If you regularly use manual mode on your smartphone’s camera, you’ll appreciate the depth and versatility each offers, and be able to create impressive stills and video with them. However, if you’ve never touched manual mode and are not familiar with the principles of shutter speed, white balance, ISO, and manual focusing, then the learning curve is very steep.It sounds like I’m down on the Xperia 5 II’s camera, but I’m not really. It just frustrates. It can take some wonderfully atmospheric photos with beautiful colors, I like the combination of an ultrawide and a telephoto, and the physical camera shutter button is a great tactile, ergonomic addition. But it’s inconsistent, is sometimes outperformed by other cameras on phones that cost less, and puts too much emphasis on features that will be beyond many potential owners.Everything is there in Sony’s camera on the Xperia 5 II and the Xperia 1 II to take wonderful photos, but unlike the Pixel 5 or iPhone 12 Pro, it won’t happen just by pressing the shutter button. If that sounds like something you like, and are interested in learning more about the mechanics of photography, you’ll appreciate the Sony phone more.Using the Xperia 5 II as my daily phone has not revealed any performance shortcomings. It is as fast as you’d expect from a phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor inside, along with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage space. Asphalt 9 Legends plays brilliantly and takes advantage of the 21:9 aspect ratio screen too, and the phone’s lightness makes it excellent for long gaming and movie sessions.Sony’s user interface with Android 10 is unobtrusive, and the software is fast and reliable. There are various non-Sony apps preinstalled including LinkedIn, which disturb you with annoying notifications and are a pain to manually uninstall. The tall screen takes a little getting used to if you’ve been looking at a wider aspect ratio screen. Icons can seem tightly grouped together, and scrolling apps like Twitter and Instagram feels constricted at first, but the ergonomic benefits the shape brings soon take over.I have encountered some problems with Wi-Fi range and cellular connectivity. The Xperia 5 II dropped its signal more often than other phones I test, and lacks the Wi-Fi range of other models including the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 Pro. Calls are good, but it’s easy to cover the microphone on the bottom of the phone with your finger, and the front camera retains the washed-out look seen in its selfies during video calls.In the U.K. the phone supports 5G, but it does not in the U.S. While 5G isn’t a reason to buy any phone at the moment, it will matter down the road, and should be a consideration when purchasing an expensive device. It’s also unfortunate the phone still has Android 10 rather than Android 11, and there’s no confirmed date for the software update either.The 4,000mAh battery has proven very strong, easily lasting me a full day with average use of between two and four hours of screen time each day. It returned very similar battery performance to the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I’d used previously, ending long days with around 30% remaining. Without video calls, the battery should last for two days without a problem.Sadly, there’s no wireless charging, and although it supports 21-watt fast wired charging, you get an 18W charger in the box. If you happen to have the higher-wattage charger already, it’ll zip to 50% in 30 minutes. If not, then expect it to be at least 45 minutes. I like the adaptive charging mode though, which manages overnight charging cycles to extend the battery’s life span.The Sony Xperia 5 II is available to pre-order in the U.S. ahead of a December 3 release for $949 (it has already been discounted to $900). It’s available now in the U.K. for 799 British pounds.If Sony’s 21:9 aspect ratio screen and associated design appeals to you, and it really should, the Xperia 5 II is the model to buy compared to the Xperia 1 II. It does almost everything for $250 less. The screen, battery life, build, and compact dimensions all impress, although you do have to put in some effort to make the most of the camera’s talents.I like the quirky Xperia 5 II, but recognize there are better buys for the same price or less. It’s definitely part of a dying breed: A truly high-spec compact flagship phone.Yes. At $949, even with its high specification, the Xperia 5 II has plenty of competition. The $900 OnePlus 8 Pro is our pick of the Android alternatives, due to the great software and screen, while the $1,000 iPhone 12 Pro is a superb alternative, providing excellent software, camera, and design. The Galaxy S20 Plus is around the same price now, and if you’re happy with the plastic back, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is great value at $699.All of those phones are larger than the Xperia 5 II, though. If you want a brilliant point-and-shoot camera in a compact smartphone, the $699 Google Pixel 5 is our pick.The tech is there for the Xperia 5 II to last at least the duration of a two-year contract or financing plan before it perhaps starts feeling its age. The lack of 5G may prompt you to update around this time anyway. The phone is made of glass, but does have an IP68 water-resistance rating, so should prove relatively durable inside a case.Sony has been frustratingly obtuse about its Android software update schedule. It told Digital Trends it’s committed to providing regular and timely updates when we asked it about Android 11 on the Xperia 1 II, but didn’t give any specific dates. It’s similarly unclear for the Xperia 5 II. Expect an update then, but just be patient.No, there are better phones with a more generally accessible camera available for the same price. And the lack of 5G in the U.S. hurts its longevity. It’s a better option in the U.K., though, due to the slightly better price and 5G support."
47,Surface Duo,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/microsoft-surface-duo-review/,"Among technocrats, a certain crowd flatly dismisses hardware from Microsoft, turning a blind eye to the quite successful Surface line of products, ignoring the Xbox platform, skipping decades of innovation in keyboards and mice. These people point to the Windows Phone’s failure with a knowing wink, lean in close, and smugly say, “Remember the Zune?”Yes, we all remember the Zune. And Clippy. Sigh.This same crowd penciled the Surface Duo onto the list of flops out of the gate, noting that its hardware simply doesn’t compete. There’s much more to this new device than megahertz and microchips, however. With the Duo, Microsoft wants to rethink what you do with the 7 or 8 ounces of metal and glass you carry everywhere like a bible, just as the first iPhone turned portable handsets into smartphones we can’t stop fiddling with. But does it succeed?Let’s get this out of the way. It’s easy to look at a spec sheet for the Surface Duo and see a series of compromises. Sure, it’s thin, but where’s the wireless charging or 5G? Sure, it’s much cheaper than other foldables, but you lose out on the fastest chipset on the market.Think instead about design decisions. Smartphone makers have for years battled physics and Moore’s Law to shave a tenth of a millimeter off their phones and, at the same time, add an extra few minutes of talk time. These decisions are meant to squeeze as much tech goodness as possible into a device about 7mm thick and around 6 inches long.The latest example of this is the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G, a beautiful hunk of glass 6.5 inches long and 8.8mm thin. Compare it to the phone Samsung released in 2019, the Galaxy S10 Plus — a beautiful hunk of glass 6.4 inches long and 7.8mm thin.Microsoft’s Duo is different. Each screen is 4.8mm thin, a little more half the size of that new Galaxy. Half the size! Folded up, it’s 9.9 mm, just over a millimeter thicker. It’s just about the thickness of a magazine, which is simply remarkable.If the average smartphone is about the thickness of a PB&J, putting two of them together – as do other foldables such as the Galaxy Z Fold 2 or the LG V60 ThinQ – is like building a hoagie. And I’m not in the habit of sticking submarine sandwiches in my pockets.Here’s where the “design decisions” come in. Microsoft’s engineers wanted a device so thin it’ll have you gasping, a decision that drove the hardware and shaped the device. It means wireless charging was impossible to fit in. And 5G chipsets and the multitude of antennas that thread through the innards of most phones like your circulatory system simply wouldn’t work. That’s why Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 865 chip is missing. NFC requires yet another extra antenna, so it was left off as well, and with it the ability to tap to pay at a grocery store or subway turnstile. And an ordinary battery is too thick to fit this device. More on that in a second.So yes, there’s a reason the Duo lacks a bunch of features common to other phones. It’s still kind of a compromise, though, even if you know why they were left out.A pair of 5.6-inch AMOLED displays make up the Surface Duo, each with a resolution of 1800 × 1350 at 401 pixels per inch. Microsoft’s marketing team calls them “PixelSense Fusion” displays for some reason. Together, they form an 8.1-inch tablet with a resolution of 2700 × 1800. The Duo is pushing around about 5 million pixels, in other words, which seems like a lot for a device with a small battery. Battery life is nonetheless decent, a fact that speaks to countless hours of engineering work.Covered by Corning’s Gorilla Glass, the screens are deep and dark, with crisp contrast. Watching Carfection’s 2020 Mini JCW GP review, colors leapt off the screen — a little warmer than natural, but quite pleasing to my eyes. And it’s sharp as a tack, thanks to all of those pixels.A continuous torque system lets you fold the device 360 degrees into any position, but there are really four you’ll lean into: Flat as a tablet, folded like a book, completely open or closed, and propped up like a tent. It’s this last one that’s useful when watching videos. I find myself propping the Duo up next to my laptop and popping on music videos or John Oliver. It’s liberating.There’s also a special mode. Open it just a crack, and you’ll see that it shows you the time and date. This seems a little silly. If you’re raising your arm, can’t you just glance at your watch? Oh, that’s right — we’ve abandoned watches in favor of the more convenient smartphones, and then taken away some of that convenience. Hmm.Anyway, you can stop the device at any point in those 360 degrees, meaning you can make the tent short and squat if you’re a taller individual, or more acute if your tabletop is at eye level. Regardless of position, the hinge is responsive, smooth, and frankly kind of fun to use. It holds every position tenaciously as well; this tablet won’t flop in half on you. Durable? You bet.I find myself using the Duo with both hands like a book most often. Propped open in my right hand, I open apps and check email with my left. But if there’s something to dig into, I’ll fold the device back on itself and do so on a single screen. Note that this still requires two hands, a big change from nearly every other phone you’ve used.With ordinary phones, you can hold a subway strap in your left and read a Kindle book in your right. The Duo is so wide that I can’t reach my thumb across it, and I can barely hit most icons at the bottom of screen. Held in one hand, my thumb hits the center of the screen. Forget reaching for a menu.There’s no escaping the fact that the Duo is heavy. At first blush, I called it light. I was surprised that two screens wouldn’t weigh more. But if I’m being honest with myself, every phone I’ve carried in the last three years has become incrementally heavier; we’ve all just ignored it, caught up in the race for faster and newer. So I’ll say it here. At 250 grams, the Duo is heavy. Android Authority called the 220-gram Galaxy S20 Ultra “too damn heavy.” At more than half a pound, this is worse. I wonder what they’ll say about the Galaxy Z Fold 2, which will weigh you down like a brick at about 280 grams.Still, I’m willing to look past the weight if you can get more done with it. And you can! It’ll just take some work.Here’s the thing: This device is maddeningly familiar, yet doesn’t quite work like other smartphones do. Consider that the Duo is the first device I’ve ever seen that’s aware of how you’re holding it, thanks to a series of sensors that line the edges of the individual screens.Thanks to these accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, it knows when you’re holding it like a book, and responds appropriately when you’ve tented it next to your dinner plate. (Caveat emptor: The speakers are on a single side of the display, so tent it correctly or you’ll pump soundtrack at your dinner mate. They won’t be happy.)Ordinary gestures are more or less the same, except there are several new ones you’ll have to learn. A swipe up and to the left or right is different here. For some phones, that’ll give you a menu of recent apps; here, you can use that action to close an app, flinging it into the oblivion off-screen.Likewise, you can move a window from one screen to the other by dragging up from the bottom and flinging it across the divide, an action that’s totally mesmerizing. I could do it all day. Pull down from the very top of the screen for the standard settings menu; do it from ¾ of the way down for a search bar.Details like this litter the interface, showing the attention to detail Microsoft lavished on this device. Consider the line of quick-launch icons that stretches across the bottom of both screens. Open an app on one screen and the six icons skitter and dance over to the other side, where they nestle snugly next to each other to fit in. It’s charming.Button-wise, there’s little to the Duo: The right screen has a volume rocker, a power button, and a biometric reader in a dent that sits right under your thumb. I worried about this needlessly. It works well. It also gives the entire Duo a little vibration when you pick it up, as the device notices you and hints that it’s raring to go. I like this. It’s sort of like the rumble of a motor eager for the throttle.The Duo runs Android 10, with a little sprinkling of Microsoft thrown in. To capitalize on the real estate, Microsoft worked closely with Google’s team of software engineers to create special features just for a device like this, with two screens: A new icon type groups a pair of apps and launches them simultaneously side by side, one per screen. This seems immensely powerful.Likewise, Microsoft built drag-and-drop functionality into some of its apps, letting you, say, highlight a few sentences from an email in Outlook and drag it into Tasks, where it becomes your day’s agenda.The big feature is dual-screen support: Expand an app to fill both screens by dragging it from the bottom to the hinge. Outlook has been redesigned to show a list of emails at left and a reading pane at right. It’s kind of a game-changer; think for a second about how often you press the back button on your phone to return to what you had been doing.Microsoft built a smart keyboard for this device into SwiftKey, which can swap between single-thumb, dual-thumb, and full-screen modes. Thanks to all of those sensors, it knows whether the left screen or right screen is active, and will shift to accommodate only that thumb. In full-screen, it can be tough to reach all the way to the center of the keyboard, but it’s neat to hold the Duo like a little laptop nonetheless. I find myself swiping more often than not.Finally, the company built a prime directive into the Duo: Use the screens wisely. Apps that launch others will smartly do so on the second screen, letting you continue doing what you were doing. The All Trails app will launch Google Maps on the second screen; news apps can call individual site apps across the screen.I gloss over these engineering efforts only because they are few and far between: Microsoft has built support for drag-and-drop into one or two apps, including OneNote, which I’ve never found a really compelling use for. And almost no apps are designed to smartly use both screens, despite the fact that it’s been a year since Microsoft began talking about this device. Sure, they can invent this new UI, but it’s up to others to make hay with it. Google has had endless problems getting developers to make apps to fit large screens, as has Samsung; Microsoft has struggled in the past getting developers to support its newest initiatives as well. There’s a risk Instagram, Tik Tok, Adobe, and whoever else simply refuses to do the work, hindering the Duo dramatically.Speaking of doing the work, this is clearly a work in progress. After I and a bunch of other journalists complained about distracting glitches in the software, Microsoft pushed out a weekend update that improved the camera, reduced jerkiness in scrolling, fixed some quirky behavior, and more.But it’s still not quite there, which is frustrating. Every once in a while, I open the Duo and no screens come on, rather than both. Or I expect an app on the left and it’s on the right. Or I rotate the device and the app stubbornly refuses to leave portrait mode. These glitches are hard to forgive. These basics need to work every single time … or Microsoft will see a return rate higher than the national debt.Outside of smartphone reviewers, few people use the ridiculously advanced features that are baked into today’s smartphone like unexpected extras in a cookie. Spinach and chocolate chip? No thank you. Butterscotch and baked beans? Why would you even offer that? By skipping these unwanted features, Microsoft saved money and avoided the raised welt that scars the backs of most flagship phones.It must be said, the company also cut corners.The Duo includes a single camera: An 11-megapixel sensor with a basic f/2.0 aperture, very small pixels, and no OIS (optical image stabilization). It’s housed atop the right panel, ready for a selfie if you wish. There’s 4K 60 fps video, slow-motion video support, panorama and portrait modes, and digital zoom up to 7x. But it’s basic stuff, and not all of it works well.The autofocus on this camera is … not good, let’s just come out and say it. I saw some bees buzzing around my Rose of Jericho shrubs, and after saying a silent prayer for them (someone has to, after all), I leaned in for a snap, pressed the button, and watched the bees whiz off before the camera took a shot. It took me a few tries before I learned to time my shots correctly.And while colors are decent, your photos will never match the glorious shots taken by the best camera phones out there, such as the Huawei P40 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro. That said, it does do some neat tricks: Fire up the camera, rotate the right panel (the one with the lens) back, and the camera app automatically flips onto the correct panel to let you take a picture of whatever you’re looking at. Rotate it back and you’re ready for selfies. Expand the app to fill both panels and you can see your photo library on one side and the live image on the other, making it easy to review all those self-portraits.Ninety-five percent of people will find the camera perfect for 95% of the photos they want to take. Most of them would be happier with a camera as powerful as that found in the Google Pixel 4a, which costs literally $1,000 less than those fancy phones I mentioned earlier. No one viewing your photos will ever know that your images could have been a tiny bit better. More important, no one will care.As you’ve likely heard, the Surface Duo runs last year’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 platform, the same chip featured in 2019’s Galaxy S10 phones, rather than 2020’s Galaxy S20. The same processor as in 2019’s OnePlus 7 Pro, rather than 2020’s OnePlus 8. The same … well, you get the picture. It’s also got 6GB of DRAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage, depending on how much money you want to drop.But is any of that really important? The benchmarks certainly tell one story: We ran the popular 3D Mark suite of benchmarks, and saw results in line with last year’s chips:3D Mark Sling Shot Extreme: 5,745 (OpenGL)3D Mark Sling Shot Extreme: 5,055 (Vulkan)Geekbench 5 CPU: 735 single core, 2,768 multi-coreBut numbers are numbers; real-world performance is something else. Across several days and a bunch of apps, I never felt performance was in anyway subpar. If you’ve bought a laptop in the last few years, you’ll know what I mean: For the bulk of what you do, it’s probably good enough, isn’t it? Sure, a new one might be faster, but for browsing the web and checking your email, it’s exactly good enough.The Duo is an engineering wonder for a variety of reasons. One is the 3,577mAh battery, which is split across two different sides of the device. Special controllers ensure the two sides run and wear evenly, Microsoft says. Amazing! You’ll never notice it, but I find little facts like that simply fascinating.The company claims you’ll be able to get up to 27 hours of talk time, but let’s be honest: Who wants to spend that much time chatting? In my testing, with heavy web browsing, email use, and leaning into videos, I was able to stretch the battery over the entire day without an issue. The box contains an 18-watt fast-charger, which seemed to do the trick.The Surface Duo is striking, functionally distinctive, and expensive as all get-out. Having two screens seems like a novelty, but I did find myself better able to work with two screens that more or less work in tandem. With my calendar up on one side and email on the other, I can see my day at a glance. With my inbox at left and a reply message at right, my phone is suddenly far, far better at email. And propping it up to watch a video is just incredibly satisfying.That the software still needs work is concerning, however. How long will it take to polish up? And will developers embrace this strange new device? We’re left with lingering questions.The obvious alternatives are foldable screen devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 and the LG V60 ThinQ. The Duo makes them seem silly. Those things are simply enormous, and in the case of the Galaxy Z Fold 2, hundreds of dollars more. And anything with 5G might be a smarter buy, given the vast, worldwide push to develop the new networking technology. Microsoft won’t be able to simply “add it in.” It’s either there or it isn’t, and two years from now, the absence of 5G will grow in importance, just as poison ivy develops days after you touch that pretty plant.The physical shortcoming of a device like this should be the hinge, but this one feels designed to last through nuclear war. The software might be its Achilles’ heel, however: Developers should start supporting the features Microsoft has built, since they will be broadly supported in future Android builds. But will they?Are you the kind of person who buys version one of anything? Who likes dazzling friends with the newest hotness? Then, sure, grab the Duo and impress the world. Everyone else should wait a few weeks to ensure that Microsoft can work the kinks out of the software, and encourage Twitter, Facebook, Zoom, and the world’s game makers to support this platform. And they will … probably."
48,Xiaomi Mi 10,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-mi-10-pro-review/,"Xiaomi is best-known for its reasonably priced, high-spec smartphones. The new Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro doesn’t quite fit that description. It is a high-spec flagship, but it costs 1,000 euros, or $1,080 U.S. That’s nearly twice the price of the Mi 9 from last year.While we can’t change the price, we can decide whether it’s justified. I’ve been using the Mi 10 Pro for a couple of weeks to see if it’s worth the four-figure price tag. Did Xiaomi really have to follow the trend of making desirable smartphones expensive?The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro is a mature, rather than showy, phone. I hesitate to call it stealthy because it’s also a big, old bruiser of a device, and certainly won’t shrink into the background. It is a pretty phone, mostly due to the use of frosted glass on the back, which adds a modern, classy style that I also really liked about the Huawei P40 Pro. Colors on my solstice gray review model subtly shift between blue, gray, and silver. It’s nowhere near as vibrant or eye-catching as the OnePlus 8 Pro, for example.Made from glass and aluminum, the Mi 10 Pro is heavy. It’s 208 grams, and the weight is slightly biased toward the top of the phone, presumably due to the massive array of camera lenses on the back. Set to the left, the camera module sticks out by a good few millimeters, so it doesn’t rest flat on any surface. Combine this with the slippery glass, and the phone refuses to stay still when I place it on a table or the couch. It has fallen off things more than any other phone I’ve used recently.The aluminum chassis doesn’t sit flush with the glass rear panel, either, meaning you can feel a ridge when gripping the phone, something you have to do quite tightly because of its 9mm thick body. It’s not as comfortable to hold as the OnePlus 8 Pro, or the Huawei P40 Pro. It’s well-made, though, and feels very solid. Even after its various falls, it has not sustained any major damage.If you’re expecting the Mi 10 Pro’s design and materials to be reasons for the higher-than-usual price, they’re not. The Mi 10 Pro is what we’d expect from any flagship phone today, and is no different from any other top Mi device. This means it’s attractive without being over the top, the build quality is great, and you’ll be proud to put it down on the table.It’ll slide about when you do, but it’ll get some admiring glances at the same time.The Mi 10 Pro’s screen is exactly what we want in 2020. It’s a 6.67-inch Super AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 2340 x 1080 pixel resolution. While this is lower than the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, it’s perfectly adequate, and keeps power consumption in check too. I struggle to see the difference between 90Hz and a 120Hz refresh rate, so having the 90Hz rate here is absolutely fine.The screen is bright, and the AMOLED panel does what you’d expect by returning plenty of contrast, with deep blacks and some vivid colors. I love the balance here –it avoids too much saturation while keeping things lively. The level of detail is also spot-on, and watching video is lovely, thanks in part to the decent stereo speakers. Placed at the top and bottom of the phone for maximum channel separation effect, what they lack in bass, they make up for in overall volume.A small hole-punch selfie camera is in the top corner, and you quickly get used to it being there, to the point where it effectively disappears. Zoom in on YouTube videos, and you eliminate the black borders down either side of the screen, but lose a little of the picture at the top and bottom.The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime emphasizes the dynamic visuals, and because of the quality audio, I could happily sit down and watch an entire episode without wanting to swap to a tablet or TV.There is one big problem: Edge recognition, and the resulting numerous phantom touches. A software update has improved this during my review, but it’s still not perfect. I’m forever opening the Telephone app accidentally, and have made at least one unintended call too.While on a call, my cheek has activated the Mute feature, so the person I was calling suddenly stopped hearing me. Add the times I’d swipe screens or close apps with my palm, along with the slipperiness of the phone itself, and the Mi 10 Pro can be a little frustrating.Aside from this, the Mi 10 Pro provides an outstanding visual experience, and one that’s worth splurging on.The Mi 10 Pro has a 108-megapixel main sensor, the one it co-developed with Samsung, and likely almost identical to the one on the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. The 1/1.33-inch sensor has an f/1.69 aperture and optical image stabilization, plus it’s joined by three additional sensors. There’s a 20-megapixel wide-angle lens, a 12-megapixel portrait sensor, and an 8-megapixel zoom lens. The selfie camera has 20-megapixels.There’s one word to describe the majority of shots taken on a sunny day with the Mi 10 Pro: Intense. If you aren’t a fan of high levels of saturation, look away now, because the Mi 10 Pro doesn’t shy away from amping up the blues, greens, and reds. The HDR is also strong, bringing out detail in overcast skies and balancing the surroundings with it nicely. It’s not the most natural camera out there, but if you want photos you share to really catch the eye, it’s tuned in exactly the right fashion.Dig into the camera app and there are plenty of features to try. It can shoot 108-megapixel photos, which aren’t as saturated as those taken with the standard camera and can be cropped without losing detail. I like the way you can switch from macro mode to wide, standard, 2x, and 5x zoom in the viewfinder, without searching for the macro mode setting, as is the case with other cameras. The big sensor provides a lovely, natural bokeh effect too.The zoom is decent, although there are considerable dynamic and exposure differences when you get to 5x zoom. The real test of the software comes at the 50x digital maximum. At this level, it can’t come close to the Huawei P40 Pro, which outshines it in detail and clarity and also boasts a considerably steadier viewfinder. Outside of this, the zoom takes good photos, and along with the wide-angle, adds significant fun to the camera.I like some of the software and modes as well. Xiaomi’s filters are especially interesting. The Sky filter actually changes cloudy skies to bright sunny skies, and it works in an uncannily effective way. The app itself is well laid-out and speedy to use, but it is quite complex, with lots of features to keep track of. The Gallery has a photo editor, but it’s not as packed as the Huawei or Apple app, or as effective as using an app like Snapseed.Finally, the selfie camera takes good portrait shots with strong edge detection, but watch out for the skin smoothing, which seems to always be active whether the beauty mode is on or not. I’ve enjoyed using the Mi 10 Pro’s camera a great deal, and find the shots are instantly shareable without much editing. It’s not as wonderfully nuanced or as outrageously capable as the P40 Pro, but it will appeal to those who want a camera for Instagram.Xiaomi has its own version of Android 10 installed — it’s called MIUI, and this is version 11. Some may dislike the way it forces you to place apps across multiple home screens, like Apple’s iOS. It is indeed frustrating — doubly so because you have to enable the swipe-up-to-search feature in Settings or otherwise end up staring at screens full of app icons, not finding what you want.This is just the first aspect that will be different for those coming from a non-MIUI phone. The Settings menu is laid out differently, animations aren’t quite so smooth as say, Samsung’s OneUI 2.0, and the helicopter view of open apps provides a different, vertical list of cards, along with some quick-launch links. There are plenty of customization options, and I like the way you can choose how the always-on display looks. If you spend time getting it all looking and feeling right, MIUI becomes perfectly acceptable.However, I have experienced more problems here than on previous Xiaomi phones. Notifications are unreliable, and I have missed various messages through the Line app. I have had the phone connected to a WearOS smartwatch too, and it needed a restart each day to reconnect with it and deliver notifications. More startlingly, the phone would also freak out sometimes, going into a vibration loop and refusing to exit apps when it happened. On the more positive side, calls were excellent and very clear, although due to movement restrictions, I have not been able to test 5G.Ah, 5G. Now we get to why the Mi 10 Pro’s price has increased. This is the only major new feature we have not seen on a flagship Xiaomi phone before, and it’s a costly addition. It’s also not a reason to buy the Mi 10 Pro. Currently, 5G may not be available in your local area, making it a feature for the future, and of questionable value today.MIUI can be frustrating, especially when you don’t trust it to deliver notifications, but it’s always improving and Xiaomi does release regular updates for the platform. The software is probably the biggest downside to the Mi 10 Pro, mostly due to its unreliability.The Mi 10 Pro has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset and 5G modem, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS3.0 internal storage space. It has a single SIM tray, and no room for a MicroSD card. The battery has a massive 4,500mAh capacity, with 50W fast charging and up to 30W wireless charging. Here are the results from two benchmark apps:Geekbench 5: 908 Single-Core/3,168 Multi-Core3DMark: 6,422 (Vulkan)These scores are roughly the same as we’ve seen from the OnePlus 8 Pro, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, and the Oppo Find X2 Pro, all of which have the same processor. I played Asphalt 9 Legends for some time on the Mi 10 Pro, and the game never faltered,and the audio really made it an exciting experience. The phone doesn’t get hot either, due to a multilayer cooling system inside.Although there are phones with larger batteries available, the Mi 10 Pro makes great use of its 4,500mAh cell. With moderate use, I’ve got two days from it, without even turning it off overnight, although adding a long video call (which is common at the moment) and a few short voice calls caused it to finish the day with less than 10% power remaining.The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro costs 1,000 euros, or about $1,080, and launched globally in mid-April. Availability is still limited, with the phone being sold in China and a few other locations around the world. A U.K. release has not been confirmed, although it’s entirely possible the phone will launch in Europe. For U.S. buyers, the only option is to import the phone.Where you purchase it from will affect the warranty. Most reputable online import stores offer a warranty, but it may require sending it back to be repaired.The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro frustrates me. Everything I want is there, with Xiaomi wisely adopting key 2020 trends, from the 90Hz refresh rate to the versatile camera. But the software isn’t as good as it should be, especially for the price. Finally, the inclusion of 5G is (at the moment) a nod toward the future rather than something most can take advantage of today. Taken in isolation, most of these are only minor problems, but pair them with a $1,000-plus price and the availability of better devices and things get dicier. I’ve been happy enough using the Mi 10 Pro, but I’ve never felt like I want to continue ad infinitum, and that’s the frustration — it’s good, but not quite good enough to command this price.Yes. We recommend the $1,000 Apple iPhone 11 Pro, the $1,100 Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, and the $900 OnePlus 8 Pro. Those in the U.K. should also look at the Oppo Find X2 Pro (1,100 British pounds). All these phones have superb cameras, screens, performance, and battery life.The Mi 10 Pro is built well and, as mentioned, it has survived a few falls. It also has an IP68 water-resistance rating, so it’s a relatively durable smartphone. With 5G and the most up-to-date processor inside, the phone will last for many years before it’s considered “old,” but the software may become outdated before that time. Xiaomi is good at updating MIUI, but less so with advancing to any new version of Android.No, at least until Xiaomi updates the software to make it more reliable. While its other big features are excellent, the price puts it alongside some very stiff competition, all of which don’t suffer from the same software annoyances."
49,Xiaomi Mi 10T,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-me-10t-pro-review/,"Getting massive phones right is difficult, as proven by the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro. It’s a whopper, and matches the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra in overall size, but Samsung’s big phone is considerably more comfortable and natural to hold than the Mi 10T Pro. The reason why comes down to a few ergonomic choices that add up to making it more unwieldy than we would want. However, there’s no denying the phone’s ability, or its competitive price. I’ve been using it, and this is what it’s like.How whopping are we talking here? The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro weighs 218 grams, is 9.3mm thick and 76.4mm wide, and because it has a flat rather than curved screen, it feels every bit of this size plus a bit more. Handling the Galaxy S20 Ultra proves the Xiaomi’s dimensions are misleading, as the Samsung phone is wider and a little heavier, but the curved screen and thinner frame hides these things more effectively. Don’t buy the Mi 10T Pro if you’ve got small hands.The fingerprint sensor is hidden in the power button on the side ,and while it’s fast and accurate, the way you have to grip the phone to use it contributes to it feeling ungainly. The back of the phone — the model seen here is in Lunar Silver color — is a matte finish sheet of Gorilla Glass 5 that does get quite smeary with use, but looks very pretty in the right light. The camera module adds another few millimeters to the phone’s thickness, but at least the unusual design is eye-catching.I do like the modern look of the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro, and its solidity in your hand gives it a reassuringly hefty feel and emphasizes the excellent build quality, but I found it tiring to use. It’s mostly the fault of the flat screen and thick chassis, and I was often pleased to pick up my iPhone 12 Pro and use that instead. All this said, if a phone the size of the Galaxy S20 Ultra appeals, but the price does not, then the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro is worth considering.Xiaomi’s Mi 10T Pro may rival the S20 Ultra in size, but it does not do so in screen technology. Xiaomi has chosen an LCD screen for the phone, and while it has all the right specs — 144Hz refresh rate, HDR10+, and a 6.67-inch size — you will miss the contrast, colors, and sheen delivered by an OLED screen. Not only that, the lack of OLED means the phone does not have an always-on mode, which I always miss.About that 144Hz refresh rate — it simply doesn’t look as effective as I’ve seen on other phones. Scrolling through Twitter, for example, is smoother and less blurry on the 120Hz Galaxy S20 Ultra, and arguably the 60Hz iPhone 12 Pro, too. Zipping through the general operating system is pleasing to the eyes, but adding the high refresh rate to an LCD seems to be a bit of a half step, as the OnePlus Nord N10 5G left me with a similar impression.Overall, the Mi 10T Pro’s design and screen are perfectly acceptable, but it does feel a little aged compared to other big-screen phones available over the past year.This is a top-spec smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip and 8GB of RAM, and that’s reflected in the phone’s performance. It’s seriously fast, whether you’re watching movies, playing games, or just zipping around the software. It has Xiaomi’s MIUI 12 over Android 10 installed.The most annoying part of MIUI on the Mi 10T Pro is the decision to split the swipe-down menu from the home screen, with a right-hand swipe bringing in the quick access panel and a left-hand swipe showing notifications. Almost without fail, I’d swipe down the quick access controls. Reaching across the screen with one hand is difficult, due to the phone’s size, and a frustrating design choice in the software.MIUI is endlessly customizable, so if you want to change the way your phone’s software looks, it offers plenty of potential. You can select an app drawer or have app icons spread across multiple home screens, and this feature is a good example of where MIUI frustrates even when its intentions are good. When you apply the app drawer option, all your app icons remain on multiple home screens, leaving you with a cleanup job.I played Asphalt 9 Legends over my review period, and the game is immensely fast and smooth, but there’s a little heat from the back for the phone when gaming. However, this isn’t unusual for phones with the Snapdragon 865 inside. The size and weight of the phone does help here, as it’s comfortable to hold in landscape, even though the big camera module can dig into your fingers. This adds up to gaming being one of the Mi 10T Pro’s greatest strengths, right down to the great audio from the dual speakers.Xiaomi’s MIUI does require some getting used to, in the same way as Huawei’s EMUI does, but once you’ve set it up, it’s manageable and usable on a daily basis. I didn’t experience any reliability problems. However, forced to choose between it and using Samsung’s OneUI, Google’s Pixel software, or Apple’s iOS, it would come in last due to the confused design — icons are rarely the same shape, for example — and some usage frustrations.The camera module contains a 108-megapixel main camera, a 13MP ultrawide camera, and a 5MP macro camera. The 108MP camera is the Samsung HMX 1/1.33-inch sensor, which was developed with Xiaomi and has the ability to shoot 8K video. There’s no optical or hybrid zoom, but it can digitally zoom to 30x.The camera app is a little busy, and not always very logical. There are many features to play with here, including a long exposure mode, the ability to shoot video with the front and back camera at the same time, and a dedicated 108MP photo mode. However, finding these features doesn’t always make sense. For example, to activate Macro mode, it’s not under the More option, but is found under the drop-down menu at the top of the screen.The big sensor doesn’t perform as well when getting close to subjects, but I didn’t have any focusing problems. The 5MP macro lens is more usable than the useless 2MP cameras found on some cheaper phones, and even the digital zoom can produce some good photos, provided you’re not too picky.Selfies taken with the 20MP front camera are sharp and full of detail, although the various lighting modes are not as effective as Apple’s modes. Portrait mode is available front and rear. Using the back camera edge recognition isn’t great compared to phones like the Pixel 5, but the app does provide plenty of adjustment and editing options. It’s better when it’s able to see a face, as is the selfie camera. Night mode is decent at dusk, adding atmosphere without making shots look like daylight.The Mi 10T Pro’s camera is fun and versatile, and delivers photos with plenty of atmosphere, capturing wonderful colors with just the right amount of contrast and a pleasing dynamic range, even in difficult overcast conditions. Some of the additional features can be fun, but there are an awful lot to try, and not all of them are successful.It’s a massive 5,000mAh battery inside the Mi 10T Pro, and it has lasted me two days with average use. Push the phone hard with gaming and extensive video — streaming or calls — and it won’t get you through the second day. However, you won’t have any concerns about a single day. There’s 33W wired fast charging, but no wireless charging.The phone has a 5G modem, but I do not have coverage in my local area, so have been unable to try it out. I got a decent 4G LTE signal, but call quality isn’t as clear and reliable as it is on some other phones I’ve used recently, including the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra.Where the Mi 10T Pro wins points is in price. It costs 599 British pounds, or about $800 U.S., through Xiaomi’s own store and various U.K. networks. It’s not available to purchase officially in the U.S., but can be imported. Importers sell it for around $800. However, it’s worth noting it’s not an official U.S. phone, and although it will operate on GSM networks like T-Mobile and AT&T, the phone may not always grab the best signal due to band compatibility.The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro is a competent, if a little unexciting smartphone that provides top-level specs at a reasonable price. Its overall size and weight hasn’t been as well managed as on other larger phones, making it feel a little ungainly, but there’s no question it’s highly capable when it comes to performance and camera.Yes. The Google Pixel 5 ($699 U.S./599 British pounds) costs the same and has better software, guaranteed updates, and a super camera — all in a smaller, more convenient package. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE ($699/599 British pounds) and OnePlus 8T ($749/549 British pounds) are also excellent buys if the Pixel’s design and small size do not appeal. If you’re not set on Android, the Apple iPhone 12 ($799/799 British pounds) is also a better alternative.The Mi 10T Pro does not have water resistance, but it does come with an attractive transparent silicone case in the box. The specifications are great and it has 5G, so on a technical level, the phone will last for several years without a problem. Xiaomi updates its own software often, but there’s no guarantee when an update to further major versions of Android will arrive. There is no official release date for Android 11 with MIUI 12 on the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro.No. The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro may have plenty of power and ability, but the big, heavy body and LCD screen means it doesn’t feel as up-to-date externally as other phones available for the same price."
50,Asus ZenFone 6,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-zenfone-6-review/,"For the ZenFone 6, Asus didn’t want to make a phone that’s the same as all the others. By approaching the core technology in a new way, the ZenFone 6 is not only one of the most interesting Asus phones in a while, but also one of the most versatile.I’ve been using the ZenFone 6 for several weeks, and also visited Asus in Taipei, Taiwan ahead of launch to see how the ZenFone 6 was developed. Yes, the flip camera is the headline-grabbing feature, but the rest of the phone is just as interesting and unusual. It has been a very welcome, and very capable companion that makes me excited about Asus’ smartphone future.The ZenFone 6 was conceived around four principles: A big-screen viewing experience, long battery life, fast and smooth performance, and photographic creativity. Lofty goals, but hardly unique. But Asus has delivered on them in some unusual ways.The phone’s 3D, curved Gorilla Glass 3 rear blends into the metal chassis, while the Gorilla Glass 6 over the screen stands proud of the body. This technique masks the size of the phone both visually and when you hold it. If, like me, you admire the uniqueness of the Asus ROG Phone, the ZenFone 6 also has its own identity; but it’s more usable on a daily basis than the gaming phone. Does the large 5,000mAh battery make the phone too big and thick? At 9.1mm thickness — yes — but at 190 grams, it’s comparably lightweight over its rivals.The notch-less, 6.4-inch LCD screen has a Full HD+ resolution, and although Asus calls it NanoEdge, the bezels are similar in thickness to an Apple iPhone XR or a Galaxy S10e. It also has a slightly larger “chin” or bottom bezel. It’s of good quality, but I miss an always-on AMOLED screen. The LCD also isn’t very bright when viewed outside in sunlight, and the auto brightness is slow to react, making it not good enough to compensate for fast changes.A big-screen viewing experience, long battery life, fast and smooth performance, and photographic creativity.Initially, a rattle caused by the camera module as the phone vibrated annoyed me. I know it’s the camera module, because when you hold it down, the phone vibrates normally. The camera module doesn’t flap about, but it doesn’t sit against the body quite tightly enough when flush in its compartment. Over time, I’ve noticed it less, but it definitely makes the phone louder in vibrate mode.The movement when the module does flip around is highly mechanical — in that you can hear and even feel the gears working. When activating it in the camera app, it’s a smooth, nicely-dampened motion. If you slide the camera view button up and down, you can control the camera’s angle yourself, and even the speed of the movement. It feels well engineered.I really like using the ZenFone 6, but aside from the flip camera, it doesn’t look or feel like a “modern” phone, in that it’s quite thick and has a rear-facing fingerprint sensor. This isn’t a bad thing, but compared to phones like the OnePlus 7 Pro, the ZenFone 6’s design is a step behind.The motorized flip-around camera system is the feature everyone will talk about. To facilitate the notch-free screen, Asus has made its own interpretation of the pop-up motorized camera. From the back of the phone, the dual-lens camera looks like any other, but to take selfies, it flips over the top of the phone. Almost everything you can do with the rear camera, you can do for selfies too.A Sony IMX586 48-megapixel camera sensor is the star of the ZenFone 6’s lens array, and it’s joined by a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens, all wrapped up inside a wonderfully complex module made of highly durable, super-lightweight liquid metal. How complex? There are 13 gears inside delivering the torque needed to flip the camera around. In a regular pop-up camera, there are usually only five gears.Liquid metal was chosen for durability as it’s four times more resilient than stainless steel, and the mechanical movement has been tested to 150,000 cycles. It’s really clever, too. For example, it works with the proximity sensor so it won’t accidentally open or close when it’s against the side of your face — helpful if you’ve got long hair and don’t want it caught in the mechanism — and the gyro automatically flips the camera closed when it senses the phone is being dropped, just like the OnePlus 7 Pro’s pop-up camera.What’s it like? Using it is so much fun. The rotation moves through 180 degrees, and you can stop it at any point by using an on-screen slider or even the volume keys. I love the automatic panorama mode, where the camera itself moves to capture the scene, rather than you following directions on the screen. It even tracks movement, so you can follow a subject on the move without always being concerned about watching the viewfinder. Finally, Asus has added its own pop-up camera control overlay so you can use the feature in apps like Instagram and Twitter.All these features will be for nothing if the quality isn’t there. After several software updates, the camera has improved considerably from the early version I tried. The HDR setting is effective, taking great shots in challenging lighting, while Night mode takes bright, clean, blur-free low-light images. It’s versatile with a 2x zoom and the wide-angle mode, plus edge detection in portrait mode is excellent.Saturation levels are not too extreme, although some night shots are a little too smooth sometimes, and color accuracy was sometimes off in previous versions of the software — with yellow and green levels especially. Selfies outperform most other phones, due to the quality of the lenses and software. They’re really fantastic with plenty of detail, and a strong portrait mode. A beauty mode can be controlled in portrait but not in normal mode, and although some have noticed it adds some unwanted effects this way, it has not occurred for me.The camera takes attractive, shareable photos, and has plenty of versatility, whether it’s facing toward the back or the front.There are some downsides to the camera. It doesn’t include optical image stabilization, only electronic stabilization, because the additional weight would have dramatically affected the size and weight of the motorized module. Face unlock is onboard, but it’s not automatic — you have to slide up the screen to make it work, which is slower and less convenient than other systems.The ZenFone 6’s camera takes attractive, shareable photos, and has plenty of versatility, whether it’s facing toward the back or the front.ZenUI has been consigned to history, and in its place comes a clean, almost Pixel-like Android experience. Deep inside are a lot of speed improvements, from clearing apps to memory management, and a faster initial launch time. The work has paid off — it’s quick, fluid, and there are no irritating slowdowns when switching between multiple apps.The simple Android experience means you have a slide-up app tray, a slide-down notification screen, and the Google Feed to the left of the home screen. App icons are consistently designed, the design is pleasantly coherent, and there are only a few pre-installed Asus apps. It’s still customizable, and Asus has added some cool features — for example I switched to the new Asus-made Dark Mode and haven’t gone back.ZenUI on the ZenFone 6 is a massive step forward in gaining mainstream appeal for the phone, and it’s excellent. It’s incredibly close to using Android on a Pixel, and is smooth, fast, and for the most part reliable too. It has crashed a few times — mostly the Gmail app, oddly — but that’s all. ZenUI is a genuine reason to buy the ZenFone 6 over phones with more complex, highly–customized user interfaces. Asus has also been sending out updates to my early review model too, with the third one arriving as this review is being written. It’s good to see commitment like this — you won’t find timely updates on comparably-priced phones like the Moto Z4.No compromises have been made on the specifications. The Snapdragon 855 processor is inside with 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB storage space. Asus worked hard to redesign the PCB, creating a two-piece board, so it can fit in a triple-slot SIM tray with room for two SIM cards and a MicroSD card as well. This is very welcome, and more preferable than having to choose between storage and a second SIM.Here are the benchmark results (with those completed using Asus’ AI Boost feature, which promised to improve benchmark test results, in parenthesis):I have not come across a situation where the ZenFone 6 lacks power, or is anything other than pleasurable to use; the benchmark scores prove its prowess, as the base AnTuTu score is the third highest score we’ve seen to date, coming short of the OnePlus 7 Pro and the 2019 iPad Air.Asus went to some lengths to explain to Digital Trends why it has made certain decisions on the ZenFone 6. It has a rear fingerprint sensor and not an in-display sensor because it would have made fitting in the large battery and a 3.5mm headphone port impossible. The rear sensor is a tried-and-tested method of securing a smartphone and it’s fast and reliable here, but it doesn’t keep up with the latest design trends. The ZenFone 6 looks dated because of it.The 5,000mAh battery is excellent. Although it only returned 12 hours 37 minutes in our continuous YouTube video test — meaning it’s bested by the Huawei P30 Pro, which has a smaller capacity battery — on a daily basis it’s incredibly strong. Even on the heaviest usage days, it never fell below 20%, and with light use it sometimes finished at above 50%.Two days careful use is easily possible, and I’ve even had a weekend away where I forgot a charger, switched to airplane mode overnight, and still had power for regular use with Google Maps guidance on the second day.For charging, you have to plug it in as there’s no wireless charging. Asus says it impacts the battery’s lifespan over time, which is also the reason it doesn’t have charging faster than 18W. This is something we haven’t found to be entirely true in our research. Regardless, the higher capacity battery is how Asus chose to deal with these problems, as the extended use time cuts down the need to recharge so often, or so quickly.It works. Battery anxiety is not a problem with the ZenFone 6.The ZenFone 6 is available in Europe and the U.S., at 500 euros and $500 respectively. You’ll be able to pick it up in the U.S. from Asus, Amazon, B&H, and Mobile Advance. There’s a year’s warranty, and like the ROG Phone, it covers manufacturing defects, but not misuse or water damage.The ZenFone 6 embodies everything that’s great about smartphones in 2019. It doesn’t follow trends set by Apple and Samsung, it doesn’t just adopt the features other manufacturers have  chosen, and it doesn’t repeat mistakes that have hurt ZenFone models in the past. Asus has taken a step back, relaxed, and thought about what it needs to do to compete this year. The ZenFone 6 is the result, and it’s superb.At $500, the Asus ZenFone 6 is a bargain; but there are some other great cheap phones to consider before buying it. In the U.S. the $550 OnePlus 6T is its best and closest competitor when it comes to price, but the $400 Google Pixel 3a has a very strong camera and software experience for a slightly lower price. Spend a little more to get the $750 OnePlus 7 Pro for its beautiful screen and ultra-modern looks.In the U.K., if the ZenFone 6 hits a 500 British pound price tag, the 500 pound OnePlus 7 is its direct competitor, along with the excellent Xiaomi Mi 9 at around the same price. The Honor 20 Pro should arrive at the end of July, or a little before, and will also be similarly priced. These all offer more features and more power than the 400 pound Google Pixel 3a, which doesn’t represent as good value in the U.K..This is not a rugged phone, so you’ll have to be careful if you want it to last. There is no IP rating for water resistance, but Asus said it’s protected against rain and general damp conditions. The body is made from glass, and I did manage to crack the back of my review phone after a very minor fall. There is a polycarbonate case included in the box, and I recommend using it.Otherwise, the phone will easily last more than the duration of a two-year contract, due to it having the latest processor, currently good software support, and an innovative and fun camera.Yes. The Asus ZenFone 6 has the performance, the battery life, and the software experience we want from a great smartphone in 2019, at a price that’s very competitive. Plus, the flip-over camera is not a gimmick and does come with some interesting features. The ZenFone 6 easily holds its own in 2019, even among this year’s serious smartphone competition."
51,Honor 20,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/honor-view-20-review/,"It has taken a while, but we’re getting closer to avoiding the visual pain of the notch and enjoying a beautiful full-screen experience on our phones. The Honor View 20 uses the company’s All View Display, which replaces the notch with a hole punch, through which the front-facing camera looks out.The Honor View 20 is the first internationally launched phone to use such a display, and we’re happy to say that it’s a massive success, but the phone has a lot more going for it than just the special screen. In fact, we think it’s Honor’s best phone yet, and here’s why.Editor’s note: We’ve added finalized pricing details from Honor.Use the Honor View 20 for an hour, and you won’t notice the hole punch at all. It’s a marvel of design, perfectly implemented, and technically very impressive. It’s the solution to our notch hatred because it’s not obnoxious, doesn’t get in the way, and genuinely increases the screen-to-body ratio. Play games? You don’t see it, as your thumb mostly covers it up while you play. Simply, we never want to see another notch, and only want to see hole-punch screens. It’s a 10/10 raging success, and the first of two standout design features on the Honor View 20.The second is the back of the phone. After years of trying, Honor has found a design that gives one of its phones an identity. It’s shockingly simple, really, as it’s just reflective V patterns running down the back of the device, but it’s so well implemented and realized that it never fails to catch your eye or make you smile. Honor calls it Light For Honor, a 300 nanometer, multi-layer super-micro pattern, and the V-shape on each shiny View 20 appears like it’s emerging from a pool of water.If you thought Huawei’s twilight color or the Vivo Nex S’ rainbow reflections looked good, the View 20 is a step beyond. It’s fantastic, and if it’s bettered in the near future we’d be surprised. You can see the phantom blue model here, and there’s also an equally stunning red, and a more subdued black version. Trust us, you’ll want the blue or red one.We never want to see another notch, and only want to see hole punch screens.The rest of the phone is similarly impressive. It’s not overly slim or light, at 8.1mm and 180 grams, but it’s perfectly manageable and easily fits in a pocket. The fingerprint sensor is in the most convenient and reliable spot — the back, top-center — there’s a USB Type-C for charging, and a 3.5mm headphone socket too. What more could you ask for?It’s not perfect though. The hole punch camera still takes away some of the notification line, although there’s a lot more space than with a notch, and it can be distracting when watching full screen video.The 6.4-inch, 2,310 x 1,080 pixel resolution is good, if not outstanding. There’s plenty of user adjustment though, from the temperature to normal and vivid viewing modes, and it does get suitably bright. However, when compared to the OnePlus 6T it’s slightly lacking detail, where the OLED panel’s crisp contrast and solid colors make it look better, especially at varied viewing angles.It’s a single-lens camera on the back of the Honor View 20, but a very special one. It’s the Sony IMX586 sensor, which has 48 megapixels and a f/1.8 aperture, joined by a 3D Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensor rather than a secondary lens. Under Settings you can select 12 megapixel shots, 48 megapixel shots, or 48 megapixels with Honor’s A.I. Ultra Clarity mode, designed for photographing scenes and still objects in daylight.For night and low-light shots, Huawei’s Night mode is present, and the 48 megapixel sensor uses 4-into-1 pixel binning and artificial intelligence-driven stabilization (AIS) to increase brightness and quality, and reduce noise.That 48 megapixel count is very tempting. Photos take up between 8MB and 12MB of storage space each time, so at least four-to-six times that of a regular 12 megapixel picture. To see whether it’s worth the extra space, it’s best to view the images on a monitor. On the phone’s screen the differences are minimal, and when you do spot some, it’s difficult to say if it’s better or worse than the others. That said, the 48-megapixel images are sharper than a bag of nails, and the more natural color management is often spectacular.The V-shape on each shiny View 20 appears like it’s emerging from a pool of water.You can zoom right in without losing much quality too. If you edit on a computer, rather than on your phone — the View 20 can also shoot RAW files in Pro manual mode — there is a lot more to work with, and we expect photography fans to be able to get plenty of creative enjoyment out of the 48-megapixel camera here.To illustrate the differences, or potentially the lack-of, we took four photos of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas. One in 12-megapixel mode, in 48 megapixel mode, in 48 megapixel Ultra Clarity mode, and in Night mode because it was after dark. Night mode’s sky is the least black, but the environment takes on the most golden hue, while the others are very similar. The Ultra Clarity photo has an ever-so-slightly blacker sky, but not by much. It’s likely that in the right environment, with the right conditions, Ultra Clarity will be the best mode; but until you’re familiar enough to recognize this, you’ll likely have to take a photo with each setting to make sure you don’t miss out.Honor’s edge detection for its Aperture mode — now strangely hidden under the More menu, rather than the main screen — is still excellent, as is its Portrait mode. Images taken in low light are better almost without Night mode, with the 48-megapixel mode pulling in plenty of ambient light. Daytime images are good, but didn’t really make us say “wow” very often, not in the same way as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, and the Google Pixel 3 can. However, it’s not far away.We do think it will benefit from some software tweaks from Honor, as in some cases we noticed some odd haloing around some subjects in the dark. After some attention, there’s a good chance the View 20 could challenge the Pixel and the Mate 20 Pro on occasion. This is a phone that costs around half of both those great phones, which makes it especially impressive.Selfies are taken care of by the  25-megapixel hole-punch camera, and the software has lighting effects, a beauty mode, and artificial intelligence too. The results are good, but only when all the extraneous effects have been switched off. They’re just too unnatural with them on, and we’d end up using a lot of filters to make them more acceptable. We liked them without any enhancements, using only the A.I. mode. The off-center angle of the lens didn’t worry us, and it works really well in indoor lighting too.Taking pictures with the Honor View 20 is addictive. You get the impression it has more ability than you have talent, and so you try to do better each time, and look for more challenging opportunities. We like that quality a lot, and have loved some of the pictures we’ve taken so far. We’re hoping for a few small software tweaks to really help bring out the new sensor’s best though.Honor is part of the Huawei family, and so the Honor View 20 uses the Kirin 980 processor with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and has 128GB or 256GB of internal storage space. Our review model has an 8GB/256GB configuration and runs Android 9.0.1 with the January 2019 security patch installed, and Honor’s Magic UI 2.0 over the top. This very, very closely resembles Huawei’s EMUI 9, but Honor has told us the two will gradually go in their own directions in the future.We ran some benchmark tests to establish the Honor View 20’s performance:Comparing the View 20 to the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the Mate 20, which also use the Kirin 980, the Honor phone actually returns slightly higher performance figures. It also beats out the OnePlus 6T and the Pixel 3, apart from in AntTuTu. However, it’s not by much, and benchmarks are only a guide to overall ability. Just consider the View 20 a powerful smartphone.What’s all this about Magic UI 2.0? Isn’t it just EMUI with a different name? Currently yes, it’s EMUI with a different name, and when we spoke to Honor about it, we were told it will become a different beast in the future, with more “youth-focused” features, whatever that means. For now, if you like EMUI, you will like Magic UI. For those that don’t, we recommend having patience and tweaking the many settings to make it feel more like home. No, it’ll never be like Android on the Pixel, but it’s faster and smoother than it ever was before.Annoyances still prevail. The hateful SwiftKey is still the standard keyboard, the notification support isn’t as good as on the Pixel, and we miss little features like tapping the date on the Pixel and jumping to the calendar. The keyboard is uncomfortable to type on for long periods of time, due to how close it is to the bottom of the device.Honor has also slimmed down the shortcuts in the notification shade as standard, restricting it to five. You can add more, but it has to be done manually. There’s no way to edit the camera options in the camera app either, with Aperture being relegated to the More section now, despite us using it more than the Portrait option. That said, animations have been smoothed out, helpful notification dots sit over app icons, you can have an app drawer, and the gesture control system is really good.Gaming on the View 20 is awesome. Not only does the phone have plenty of power, but the full-screen experience really does make a difference to gameplay. There’s no notch to notice, and you quickly become immersed in the game itself, much like you do on a Nintendo Switch or PlayStation Vita. We played a lot of Asphalt 9: Airborne, and saw no stutters or frame rate drops. The Honor View 20 has Honor’s GPU Turbo gaming enhancements, which while boosting only certain games to the maximum, does help other games run smoothly too. It shows, and the View 20 is a great gaming device, aside from the slightly disappointing speaker.A solitary speaker is at the bottom of the phone, and it’s at best average. There’s a 3.5mm headphone socket though, which will please many people. It’s good news on the Bluetooth side too, as the Honor View 20 has AptX HD for the best wireless sound quality (with compatible headphones). We have been listening with the Bowers & Wilkins PX headphones, which are dreamy anyway, and sound good with the View 20.]However, there isn’t as much volume as we were expecting, and with Spotify we had to crank it up to maximum to be drowned in sound, and it was by no means ear splitting. We’d describe the View 20 as giving a neutral, natural sound that puts less emphasis on the bass as some may like. There’s not much volume out of the earpiece on calls either, mainly due to its size and placement at the very top of the screen edge.We’re very pleased to see a 4,000mAh battery inside the Honor View 20, and it really makes a big difference. The Kirin 980 is great at managing power, the screen isn’t ridiculously high resolution, and Huawei has baked plenty of battery saving measures into EMUI, which we assume have been replicated in Magic UI 2.0. The result? Two days above average use is easily possible. We’ve also been testing it connected to a smartwatch, and this has not overly affected the strong battery life. A definite plus, along with the fast charging system too.The Honor View 20 is available to buy from January 22 for 500 British pounds ($650) if you select the 6GB/128GB model, and 580 pounds ($755) if you go for the top 8GB/256GB version. A special Moschino version costs the same as the 8GB/256GB model and comes with a special case, wallpapers, and box. It’s available directly through Honor’s website, or from various retailers including Argos, Carphone Warehouse, Amazon, and others. You can also purchase the phone with a contract through the O2 network.In Europe the price is 570 euros for the 6GB/128GB version in black or blue, while the black, blue, or red 8GB/256GB version is 650 euros, the same as the Moschino version. Buy an Honor phone in the U.K. and you get a two-year warranty, and six-months on the battery. It covers the usual manufacturing defects, but not wear and tear or abuse.No release for the U.S. has been announced yet, but that’s not to say one won’t come in the future.Just a glance at the beautiful Honor View 20 will see you swoon, but it’s the camera and screen tech that’ll convince you to buy, and it’ll take less cash than you expect to secure one too.The big challenger to the Honor View 20 is the $550 OnePlus 6T, which is joined by other strong performers with value-based price tags like the $350 Nokia 7.1, the 400 British pound Honor 10, and in the U.K., the 550 British pound Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018). For U.S. buyers, the $450 Motorola Moto Z3 Play should be considered, but otherwise, to come close to the View 20’s ability you’ll have to look at the $800 Google Pixel 3, the $650 LG G7 ThinQ (although this is getting old), or the $750 Apple iPhone XR.What about the Huawei Mate 20 Pro or Mate 20? Both are excellent smartphones, but both are also a lot more expensive than the Honor View 20 — almost double in the Mate 20 Pro’s case. We’d choose the Pro over the Mate 20, but it’ll be down to your wallet size and desire for the Leica-tuned camera to dictate if it’s worth the extra money.The Honor View 20 has a very modern design, and the first widely available hole-punch screen, so it’s going to look fresh and exciting for some time. It’s not a rugged phone, and has no water resistance, so you’ll have to be careful. There is a transparent silicone case in the box, which we recommend using. Two years use out of the Honor View 20 should be considered the minimum.Yes, definitely. There are very few downsides on what we think is Honor’s best phone yet, bringing together a super-modern design, very cool tech, and a creatively exciting camera, all for a tempting price."
52,Huawei Mate 30,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-30-pro-review/,"Let’s get this out of the way: the Huawei Mate 30 Pro does not come with Google Play or any Google apps or services. It runs open-source Android with Huawei’s EMUI interface. It’s a shame this threatens to overshadow the device itself, as it’s another cracking high—performing cameraphone from the company.With that out of the way, let’s look at the Huawei phone, its design, and some of the special features. I have spent a few days with the phone, following its announcement in Munich, discovering the hardware and the camera’s ability.The 6.53-inch screen has an 88-degree curve down each side, giving the impression it’s cascading down each edge. It’s eye-catching, and effectively removes almost all the screen bezel from the face-on viewing experience. The OLED screen looks as beautiful, bright, and colorful as you’d expect, and the same can be said of the various device color schemes.Huawei’s a master of making gorgeous smartphones, and the new space silver and emerald green versions are standouts. The emerald green in particular has a gradient texture, where a matte finish at the bottom of the phone shifts into glossy glass near the top. It’s a beauty, and the textured matte finish really feels great to hold. There are also a pair of leather models (not real leather, as it’s vegan-friendly), and although they have a classy air to them, the reflective glass models made more of an impression.Has the cascading screen meant any compromises? While there is a hardware power button, Huawei has removed the volume buttons and replaced them with virtual controls. You activate them by double tapping on the screen edge, and then alter the volume by sliding your finger up and down on the side of the screen. They are an adequate replacement, in that the slider works well when it’s activated, with tactile haptics. But unlike a volume rocker, the phone needs to be held in a particular way for the motion to feel natural, and they take longer to use. I’d much prefer hardware buttons.What about phantom screen touches? I used various models at different times and in different ways at the launch event, and did not have any instances where the screen operated in a way I didn’t expect due to the way I gripped the phone.Since then I have used the phone more extensively, and have not found the curved sides to activate the screen often. When it does happen, the phone does get confused, but it’s a rare occurrence. Concerns over the screen accidentally registering your hand are still there (remember, it cascades down the sides) and will only become known after extended use; early impressions are good.Above the screen is a 3D sensor for a series of air gestures, much like the gestures LG introduced on the LG G8. Here, close your fist to take a screen shot, or wave your hand up and down to scroll through screens. A helpful “hand” icon appears at the top of the screen when the sensor sees you ready to make a gesture.While the screenshot works every time, I can’t get the scrolling function to operate correctly at all. I can’t imagine how often I’d use either of these features, which is similar to our experience using the gestures on the LG phone. Glitches that hold these features back will likely be solved before the phone actually goes on sale, as I am using a pre-production version.At less than 200 grams, the Mate 30 Pro is lighter than many other big flagship phones, and the frame is compact enough that you question the screen’s size when you pick the phone up. The cascading screen makes it a visual treat, and cements this as another stunner from Huawei.Two 40-megapixel lenses, an 8-megapixel telephoto lens, and a 3D depth sensor make up the unusual camera array on the back of the Mate 30 Pro. The striking design, which catches the light beautifully, is made to resemble a point-and-shoot camera, in the same way Huawei has attempted in the past, most notably with the P20 Pro.The specifications are impressive. The main 40-megapixel Ultra-Wide Cine lens has an f/1.8 aperture, the second 40-megapixel lens has an f/1.6 aperture and optical image stabilization (OIS), while the telephoto lens also has OIS, and an f/2.4 aperture.Inside the Mate 30 Pro is the new Kirin 990 processor and a new image signal processor, coupled with some impressive ISO numbers. Everything suggests the new phone will take even better photos than the P30 Pro — quite a feat on Huawei’s part. Night Mode works in ultra wide shots and video, there’s improved real-time bokeh effects for video, and it records 960fps slow-motion video at 1080p. EMUI 10‘s camera app is fluid and logically laid out, but some changes to the software have made altering zoom modes less intuitive than before.“I wish my phone camera could do that,” I was told after taking a close-up shot of a lion at the Isle of Wight Zoo, using the Huawei Mate 30 Pro. Taken from at least a meter away from the fence, the shot captures the lion’s head in wonderful detail, something even a phone camera with a 2x zoom couldn’t achieve. It’s not as versatile as the P30 Pro though, as you miss out on the 10x zoom option, leaving you with a 3x optical and a 5x hybrid zoom, and up to 30x digital.The zoom is only the beginning. The wide-angle camera adds another dimension, but has become commonplace on great camera phones in 2019. However, the Mate 30 Pro refines the performance of the Mate 20 and P30 Pro’s camera, and gets a boost from the Kirin 990 chip, the new ISP, plus the new SuperSense 40-megapixel cameras. Much like the introduction of the RYYB (red, yellow, yellow, blue, rather than a more traditional red, green, blue) sensor inside the P30 Pro, the combination of all this tech still needs to be fully realized through careful updating of the software, as at the moment the results are a little haphazard.Some shots are so fabulous they leave you breathless, while others are more mediocre. Never bad, and usually better than many other cameras, but not always quite of the quality I expect from Huawei and the tech inside the Mate 30 Pro. Night mode is excellent, as it has been before. The picture of the beach above was taken at late dusk, and the towers were taken 30 minutes later, at night with only street lighting.It adores sunny days, reproducing bright blue skies and vibrant greenery with emotion, although some may dislike the level of saturation. I don’t, I think it looks fantastic. In challenging lighting, the Mate 30 Pro excels, revealing scenes other cameras wouldn’t capture at all, without losing any detail or introducing noise. Overcast days are also handled well, balancing the varying colors and lighting beautifully.Where does it fail? Close-ups aren’t great, and the camera struggles to focus. There’s no macro mode, or at least there isn’t one that automatically activates using the extensive artificial intelligence packed inside the Mate 30 Pro, which doesn’t help. I also saw this affect food photos, where the camera preferred to isolate one piece of food rather than focus on the whole plate. The color balance and the exposure both would benefit from tweaking too, and I expect a software update to solve these problems in the future. Back to the positives, and the aperture and portrait modes are superb, with sharp and defined edge detection.The SuperSense cameras are tuned for video use, more so than previous Huawei cameras, although the Mate 20 Pro definitely started the trend. The main camera will record at up to 4K resolution and 60fps, and you can shoot in wide-angle, normal, and with the telephoto lenses too. The newest, and perhaps most interesting video feature is a slow-motion mode, which can record at an astonishing 7860fps.Some shots are so fabulous they leave you breathless, while others are more mediocre.This is, as with all slow-mo modes, very subject dependant. Whatever you’re filming at this speed has to move pretty quickly, otherwise time appears to be frozen. Because it only records at 720p at this frame rate, the quality isn’t the best. It’s still incredible that it can do it at all though. Your better bet is to record 960fps at 1080p, which produces a much clearer, higher quality video, and it has less trouble focusing on close-up items too. It’s fun, you can be really creative, and the results when you get it right are spectacular.There’s more good news when you try out the artificial intelligence (A.I.) video modes too. The A.I. has got much better at recognizing people, so it’s more effective at blurring out the background in real time. There are lots of fun effects that operate with the selfie camera too, adding filters to the video as you record. Sadly, Huawei hasn’t included a comprehensive video editing mode, and the only option is to trim the clip, or adjust the resolution. The still photo editing suite is far better.Huawei once again proves it’s way ahead of the competition with the Mate 30 Pro’s camera performance, features, and creativity. A lot of this comes from its own research and development, whole the rest will come from its partnership with Leica. The two companies have always said they’re in it for the long-run, and we are really seeing the benefits of such a solid partnership built on mutual understanding.The Huawei Mate 30 Pro runs Android, and has EMUI 10 over the top, but you won’t find any Google apps, or pre-installed Facebook or booking.com apps, like you would on other Huawei phones. It’s identical to China-only versions of Huawei phones I’ve used in the past. That’s fine, if you live in China, or can read Chinese.Open the standard Huawei browser (no Chrome here) and it frustratingly returns results in Chinese, or prompts you to open the Baidu app, where more Chinese text awaits. Obviously, this makes using the phone very difficult. The browser is also problematic when trying to use sites like YouTube, where it refused to play videos correctly. My phone’s region is set to the U.K., but it didn’t make any difference.The standard app store is the Huawei App Gallery, and it’s mostly awful. There’s a reason I don’t use it on international versions of Huawei phones, and that’s because it doesn’t contain anything of interest. Worse yet, the promoted apps make me concerned about the content and its safety. One of the top listed, “Most fun games,” is a tips app for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, complete with French text, and a hint it may lead to a pirated version of the game. No thanks.The Mate 30 Pro is currently an enthusiasts phone, ready for keen Android fans to install Google apps.What can you do about all this? The Amazon App Store is easy to install through the browser, and from there you can download Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Twitter, the Opera browser, and plenty more. To get Google Play you’ll need to work harder, but there are several ways to do so, and instructions can be found with a simple internet search. With Play installed, you can download most of the apps that are missing from the Mate 30 Pro, including Maps, YouTube, Gboard, and Gmail.It shouldn’t be this way. Like it or not, many of us rely on Google apps, even if it’s just Maps or YouTube, and an expensive phone needs to either have them installed, or make it easy for them to be installed if we want them. The Mate 30 Pro does not offer this out of the box. It’s not Huawei being difficult, and it’s certainly not what Huawei wants, but that’s the situation.Regular phone buyers will not want to deal with it, making the Mate 30 Pro an enthusiast’s plaything outside of China at the moment.The Huawei Mate 30 Pro does not have a firm release date yet, but is expected to ship in China and Asia Pacific in October. The 8GB/256GB phone has been given a 1,100 euro price tag in Europe, which is around $1,215, although exact European launch locations have yet to be confirmed.Effortless. That’s what the hardware side of the Mate 30 Pro feels like. Huawei can make great looking smartphones with a quirky charm of their own, and equip them with cameras that I just want to go outside and use, all without breaking a sweat. The Mate 30 Pro looks brilliant, it feels great in the hand, and there’s a color and finish to suit everyone’s taste.Huawei, and specifically the Mate 30 Pro, has been scuppered by the U.S. government’s ban on U.S. companies doing business with it, resulting in it not being able to incorporate Google’s app store or services. Yes, there are ways around some of this, but regular phone buyers will not understand nor want to deal with the situation. The phone will sell by the case load in China — the version here is essentially the version China would have got anyway — but elsewhere will it will be more of a challenge.It’s unfortunate. The Mate 30 Pro is another excellent smartphone from Huawei, yet there is a crucial part missing. Google’s absence would affect my everyday use, and mean I’d have to spend a lot of additional time and effort getting the apps I want on the phone, potentially with only limited success. It’s frustrating that I can’t really recommend the Mate 30 Pro, but for anyone reliant on Google services, or who just wants to download apps and already-purchased content from Google Play, it requires just a little too much work to make that possible.Despite being mainstream, the Mate 30 Pro is currently an enthusiasts phone, ready for keen Android fans to install Google apps and work around the software foibles. If that’s you, and you put in the effort, you’ll end up with a highly-desirable smartphone with an incredibly capable camera.Updated on September 25, 2019: Added in further comment on the phone, camera, and software"
53,Huawei Mate X,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-x-review/,"I concluded my original hands-on review of the Huawei Mate X by saying, “I’d like another go please,” and now nearly six months later, my wish has been granted. I spent about an hour with the Mate X folding phone during IFA 2019, generally using the software, snapping a few photos, and of course, folding and unfolding the body.At the same show, just a day earlier, I spent almost the same amount of time with the Samsung Galaxy Fold in its revitalized form, something I hadn’t done when using the Mate X for the first time in late February. It gave me context, and a better ability to compare the first two powerhouse foldable phones you’ll be able to buy in 2019.Yes, buy. Foldable phones are really here.The Samsung Galaxy Fold is set to be released in the U.S. before the end of September, and in the U.K. on September 18, following an extensive redesign. Huawei says the Mate X has been mostly ready for sale since March, so why hasn’t it been released? Huawei has repeatedly said the wait for 5G and a continued push for developer support have been the main reasons for not doing so. Now, with concerns over the use of Android on Huawei phones, there are even more reasons for holding back.The latest report says the Mate X will be released in October, with another model featuring the Kirin 990 chip coming later. Both will have a 5G connection, but the exact locations where the Mate X will go on sale is unknown.In March, when I saw the Mate X in the company of Huawei Business Group Chairman Richard Yu, he told me the Mate X had been in development for three years. “It’s the most difficult smartphone project we’ve had,” he said at the time.It’s an inwardly folding smartphone, so it has one screen that folds to create two, all using an ultra-technical hinge Huawei calls a Falcon Hinge. It’s hidden away from view, but it’s a complex masterpiece of design, with sliding metal panels over the top to keep the rear panel neat and tidy. All this works in harmony to facilitate the phone’s folding action, and how the two panels fit flush together. It’s crucial to the Mate X’s operation, and has been tested to more than 100,000 folds, while the body itself has been through substantial drop tests.Between the beginning of the year and now, the Mate X has not changed visually at all, although there have apparently been some slight tweaks inside. What’s it like, and how does it all work? There’s no obvious grip point for when you want to unfold it, because the screen folds over on itself, and the edge fits flush with the bar running down the side. To open the Mate X, you press a button on that bar, and the rear screen section pops out, ready for the phone to be completely unfolded. It’s clever, neat, and satisfying.Closed, the Mate X feels quite thick compared to other modern smartphones, but at 11mm, it’s not obtrusive, nor does it feel like you’re picking up a phone book. The thickness makes it feel a little heavy, but it’s mostly an illusion, as unfolded the Mate X is very light, and almost perfectly balanced. That edge bar really does work for grip, and makes the phone simple, natural, and comfortable to hold in one hand.The open display is perfect for watching movies, looking at photos, reading books, or general media consumption. Like a tablet though, it didn’t feel natural to do anything like typing while holding it with one hand. Learning new ways to use and interact with a folding smartphone comes with the territory.The version I used was apparently ready for sale, and the hardware was final. The screen itself does have a noticeable crease running down the fold line, which was more pronounced this time than I remember it being in March. It’s not especially visible, but you can definitely feel it with your finger. It has aslightly crumpled texture, but is not something that would put me off using the Mate X. Running your finger over the screen has a different sensation too, as it’s not made of glass.Less than 24 hours earlier, I had been using the Samsung Galaxy Fold. I don’t know how old the Mate X I used was, but the Fold was essentially brand new, as it was one that included Samsung’s fixes. The screen still had a crease down the fold line, but it was less pronounced than the Mate X’s, and the overall touch sensation was more pleasing than the Mate X’s — not by much, but enough to make the Fold feel like a true final product, while the Mate X still feels like a first-generation prototype.While Samsung edged Huawei out here, Huawei gains ground back when the phone is folded. The outer screen on the Fold is for notifications. It’s too small to be used for anything serious, including web browsing or reading long emails. When the Mate X is folded, it’s suitable for just about anything as the screen is as big as the one on your current phone. The Mate X is also more comfortable to hold folded up than the Galaxy Fold.The Mate X that I tried in March had Google apps installed, but this time I used a Chinese version that did not. While I used Google Maps in March, this time it was Baidu Maps, for example. Earlier this year, the software seamlessly swapped between screens, despite the phone technically only having a single screen. Video playing on the large unfolded screen quickly shifted to the main screen when it was folded up, and then to the rear screen when the Mate X was turned over.For the most part, the software is still stable and reliable, but as before, there were a few times when it got confused, resulting in stutters and one lockout. Otherwise, it’s speedy and fluid. There are some really neat touches too. The selfie camera screen — it’s the “rear” screen that’s next to the camera lenses — works really well, and the camera viewfinder is massive when the phone’s unfolded. You don’t have to use the tablet view either, it’s perfectly happy being used as a “normal” phone when folded up, and it’s here where the Mate X is the more desirable option over the Galaxy Fold.The Fold is made to be used unfolded. It’s wonderful that way, but folded up, it’s not such a great experience, due to the large bezels around the outer screen. The Mate X does not have this problem, and using it is like using a normal phone one minute and a tablet the next. The promise of folding phones, delivered, in other words.New, shiny, exciting things make me go wobbly at the knees. It can’t be helped, and is a sad side-effect of seeing cutting edge tech up close for the first time. What about when Mr. Sensible butts in and forces some critical thinking? Outside of someone who watches hours of mobile video on a very regular basis, is it really any better than having a big-screen smartphone? Yes, but with some reservation. The Mate X’s big screen makes maps great to use and look at, video and photos are pretty to look at — the Mate X’s screen is colorful, sharp, and has excellent contrast levels — and it’s super for multitasking. However, the same can be said for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus.Get a  Mate X, and you’ll be the envy of every tech fan out there. Several people looked at the Mate X like it was from another planet when it was used outside, and more than a few did a double-take as they walked past. It will become the center of attention, at least for a while, after its release. However, nothing quells excitement like hearing the object of your desire will cost 2,300 euros, or about $2,600 U.S., to own.It’s easy to see how and why the Mate X costs so much, and don’t expect that to change in the near future either. In March, Yu said the price of foldable smartphones won’t come down to the more usual flagship smartphone prices for two or three years, due to the complex screen and mechanical technology inside.Using the Huawei Mate X again was just as exciting as it was the first time, and in a way that new technology needs to be — enticing enough that I still want to try again, and so filled with potential that I’ve since imagined how helpful it could be while using my current phone. Despite having been lucky enough for two goes with the Mate X already this year, I’m still hankering after another, and that’s an extremely positive reaction to cutting-edge tech."
54,Huawei P30,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-p30-pro-review/,"There are times when the Huawei P30 Pro’s camera is so staggeringly good, it defies belief. I’ve questioned whether I’m mistaken, and what I’m seeing is an error, or that my eyes are playing tricks. Whether it’s taking a seemingly impossible photo in the dark, or zooming right in on a subject far away, the P30 Pro’s camera is a bit like being Superman.That’s before talking about the P30 Pro’s battery, build, and design, all of which are of a very high standard. Excelling in several areas doesn’t make the P30 Pro the perfect smartphone though, and the camera sometimes falls frustratingly short elsewhere — but mostly because we demand a lot from it — and some will dislike the software.Additionally, and you may already know this, but the P30 Pro is a phone you won’t be able to buy at a store if you live in the U.S., and more than ever before, you’re missing out on something very, very special indeed. How good is it? It deserves to be the benchmark against which all other cameras taking specialized photos should be judged.The Huawei P30 Pro’s design is a blend of the P20 Pro and the Mate 20 Pro that came before it, and it benefits greatly from being kept in a case. The sides are less sharp than the Mate 20 Pro, but are still tapered enough that it’s noticeable in the palm. A transparent silicone case is included in the box, and we’ve kept it inside after a day or so, as it makes the phone more comfortable and less slippery to hold. Transparency is important, as Huawei has spent considerable time making two of its most stunning colors on a phone, yet.At first, the glowing orange/red version — called “amber sunrise” — will be the one you want; but don’t dismiss the stupidly named “breathing crystal,” a stunning blue-to-silver, with shades of pink and green (an oyster shell-style gradient), which will become the connoisseurs choice. A black and an “aurora” (Huawei’s trademark blue hue) model are also available. All finishes are smooth, lustrous, and beautifully reflective. The amber sunrise model seems to attract fewer fingerprints than the more glossy breathing crystal version.The P30 Pro weighs 192 grams, with a slight top-heavy bias, which is almost certainly caused by the additional camera technology. This leads us to one of the P30 Pro’s design flourishes —  The ends of the phone are flat, and yes with careful balancing, you can stand it up. It’s a little heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, but lighter than the OnePlus 7 Pro, the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom, and the iPhone XS Max. It’s slim too, and is very easy and comfortable to carry around in your pocket.The colors really give the P30 Pro its character. Choose the black version at your peril.The notch in the screen is tiny and contains only the selfie camera. This is a major benefit over the Mate 20 Pro’s all-dominating notch, as you get more notification space along the top of the screen, at the expense of secure face unlocking hardware. The bezels are also tiny, and there’s no fingerprint sensor under the screen like the P20 Pro. It’s more modern-looking than its predecessor, and larger and heavier than the Mate 20 Pro. The camera bump on the back contains all three lenses, consolidating them into one rather than the messier array on the P20 Pro.Examining the P30 Pro closely for the first time, it came across as a little faceless compared to the highly recognizable P20 Pro and Mate 20 Pro, both of which have individual styles. The design has grown on me since then, its simplicity coming as a shock after the challenging visual elements of its sibling phones, but it’s the colors that really give the P30 Pro its character. Choose the black version at your peril.Created with Leica, the P30 Pro’s camera has three lenses: A 40-megapixel f/1.6 aperture lens, a 20-megapixel f/2.2 aperture lens, and an 8-megapixel f/3.4 aperture lens. These are paired with a time-of-flight sensor for depth sensing. The main and telephoto camera lenses have optical image stabilization (OIS), and Huawei’s own artificial intelligence stabilization system called AIS. The camera has two main, special features — a periscope zoom feature, and an ability to take bright low-light images.There are creative opportunities galore here. There are so many modes and different things to try — you won’t get bored with using the P30 Pro’s camera. From monochrome mode and an A.I.-assisted background blur in videos, to the color splash filter (where one color is isolated against a black and white image) and the highly effective Aperture bokeh mode, it’s a smorgasbord of camera fun.Let’s talk about the zoom first. Remember being impressed by what a 2x zoom on a phone could do? The P30 Pro is even more transformative, because 5x zoom gets you much closer than you expect to a subject. The amazing thing is, there’s no obvious loss of quality. It proves you really can take stunning, sharp, handheld, zoomed-in photos using a phone. The 5x zoom is, by far, the most unique and creatively exciting camera feature on any current smartphone.There are so many modes, so many different things to try, you won’t get bored with using the P30 pro’s camera.Go up to 10x (a combination of optical and digital zoom) and the sharpness and detail drops, but nowhere near as much as you may expect. It does depend a little on the environment, as the results vary indoors and outdoors. However, it’s still remarkable that a phone can do this, and even more so when you zoom in by 50x. Yes, 50x digital zoom. Prepare for whatever subject to wobble about like a maniac on the phone’s screen, but steady yourself, and the results — whilst not exactly detail-filled — are surprisingly kind-of useable, and not the mess they really should be at this zoom level on a phone.It’s when you combine the zoom capability with the wide-angle lens that the P30 Pro’s flexibility becomes clear. The 0.6x wide shot can be zoomed right in to 50x, meaning the P30 Pro takes care of almost every shot you’d ever want to take with a smartphone, even before you add Night mode, Super Macro, or monochrome modes.You may be surprised to learn Night mode has become almost superfluous, after being such a revelation on the P20 Pro. The P30 Pro’s low-light ability is so immense, it doesn’t need it. In the images above, only the boat on the water in Taipei was taken with Night mode, as there are times the photos taken with Night mode are less accurate than those taken without it. It’s so capable, that atmosphere can get lost, and skies can get too grey. Take low-light shots without it, and some of the atmosphere is retained.There is almost no low-light scenario where the P30 Pro doesn’t “see” more than any other smartphone camera out there, and that includes the Google Pixel 3’s Night Sight. The low-light images have detail, color accuracy, depth, and realism. It’s not just getting by in low light, it’s dominating the environment.Super Macro mode is an A.I.-enhanced feature. It activates when it thinks you want to take a close-up shot, or it can be selected from the More menu. It can struggle to focus correctly, and it will sometimes activate when you don’t want it to, but equally, it can take some excellent close-up shots. Monochrome mode on the P30 Pro is a Leica-tuned filter, and not true black and white like on the P20 Pro.The camera app switches quickly between lenses and zoom stages too, with only a slight pause for refocusing. However, go beyond 10x by accident, and it’s a pain to quickly return to normal zoom, with the risk of missing your shot. It’s not really a one-hand operation either. As the features on Huawei’s camera increased, so did the complexity of the app. It’s logical enough, but you have to hold the phone like a camera — with two hands — to use it effectively. The P30 Pro is definitely a phone that thinks it’s a camera.Software updates since the P30 Pro’s release have improved early problems with exposure levels, sharpness, and color accuracy, but they do still occur, especially when using the zoom or wide-angle mode. We recently compared the P30 Pro to the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom’s similar camera, which emphasized the Huawei phone’s superior ability. Updates have also added a new Dual View camera mode, where one side of the screen shows a wide-angle view, and the other shows a zoom mode. It works well, but we’re not sure how often it’ll be used, and it does come across like a gimmick, much like Nokia’s Bothie mode.Months after the P30 Pro’s release, it’s the almost-perfect, all-round smartphone camera winner, perhaps only matched by the Google Pixel 3 XL, which it beats when it comes to features. When the P30 Pro gets it right, it does so in a way that’s impossible on another phone and ends up being so superb you forgive its slight shortcomings.The P30 Pro’s OLED, 2,340 x 1,080 pixel resolution screen is great. It shows a world where colors are striking, shadows are deep, and whites crisper than newly-laundered bedsheets. It’s so bright I rarely wanted to keep it at maximum brightness, as it’s so searing you’ll need sunglasses.The stunning technicolor glory — best visualized when playing hyper-real music videos like Apink’s Eung Eung, and Izone’s Violetta, and Star Trek Discovery on Netflix — comes at the expense of realism. It can wash out easily, and skin tones aren’t as good as other OLEDs, including the iPhone XS Max. However, if you don’t mind experimenting, Huawei gives you control over the screen’s look. Dig into the menu and you can alter the color mode, temperature, and enable a reading mode too.The camera’s supreme flexibility is matched by long battery life.Screen performance is only one side of the experience, and happily the audio side doesn’t disappoint either. There’s no headphone jack on the P30 Pro, so you have to use Bluetooth or USB Type-C headphones. During our review, we’ve used both Samsung’s Galaxy Buds and Razer’s Hammerhead USB Type-C headphones — stereo separation is excellent, there’s a strong bass response, and the Dolby Atmos tweaks make a difference when using wired headsets.The internal speaker exits through a grill on the bottom of the phone, and through the USB Type-C charging port. It’s louder and clearer than the one fitted to the Mate 20 Pro, but not as high quality as phones such as the iPhone XS Max and the LG G7. It’s fine for spoken word though.Huawei has replaced the standard voice call speaker with an in-display version. It goes on about something called, “electromagnetic levitation,” which is meaningless waffle. It should just say an in-screen speaker that works just as well as a normal speaker, because it’s great. When you make a call you don’t have to be very precise with ear placement, and moving the phone around normally didn’t stop us hearing the caller. Volume drops happened if you moved your ear far down the screen, but this wouldn’t happen naturally. It’s solid new technology that works well.Huawei hasn’t changed the formula over the Mate 20 Pro much for the P30 Pro. It has the same Kirin 980 processor and a choice of 6GB or 8GB of RAM. Our review amber sunrise model has 8GB of RAM. At no time has it struggled or slowed down. It’s a powerhouse: Smooth, fast, and polished.There are some naysayers regarding Huawei’s EMUI interface — it’s version 9.1 here, over Android 9 Pie with the March 2019 security patch — but for the most part, these people are mistaken.It’s not perfect, but then neither is Android in general. Want software that has an all-over consistent and linear design? Buy an iPhone, and don’t complain about its lack of customization potential ever again. If there is a problem with EMUI, it’s the look compared to Android on the Pixel, and some may not like the overly stylized icon design.EMUI needs some tweaking, but it’s just as manageable on a daily basis as any other third-party Android user interface. Version 9.1 seems to be more stable than 9.0 on the Mate 20 Pro, plus the notifications have improved too. They now reliably show on the lock screen when you switch the option on, for example.Here are the benchmark test results:These scores put it above the Mate 20 Pro — which has the same Kirin 980 chip — but behind Snapdragon 855-powered devices including the Galaxy S10 Plus and the Xiaomi Mi 9. Benchmarks aren’t everything, but it’s interesting to see how it compares to the competition here.There are still too many apps installed we never use, from Huawei’s own browser and the hateful SwiftKey keyboard, to a mirror app, a calendar, and more. Some are good, such as Huawei’s music player and the voice recorder app, which is considerably better than the iPhone’s for example, with fast scrubbing to listen and re-listen to sections of voice recordings. The music player’s great too, with a handy timer to shut the player off after a set time. While there is a system cleaner app, it’s no longer intrusive and doesn’t deliver annoying notifications; Huawei’s own digital wellbeing app is also helpful and customizable, and it tracks your steps automatically using the phone’s accelerometer.Huawei said the P30 Pro will receive an update to Android Q in the future, despite the issues surrounding the company’s presence on the U.S.’s Entity list. At the time of writing (July 2019) my review P30 Pro has Android version 9.1 with the June 5 Android security update installed, and EMUI 9.1.Uh oh, the P30 Pro has an in-display fingerprint sensor. I turned the one on the Mate 20 Pro off because it was so frustratingly unreliable, and lived with the face unlock. It’s with great pleasure I can say the updated sensor and software on the P30 Pro is a vast improvement.It’s lower down on the screen, which does make it easier to locate, and is consistently reliable. When it does fail to read my print, it’s because I wasn’t pressing in the right place, rather than it being rubbish. There is face unlock, but it’s not secure. It is, however, faster and more reliable than the Mate 20 Pro’s face unlock.The battery delivered 24 hours of solid, heavy use.The battery has a capacity of 4,200mAh, the same as the Mate 20 Pro, with the same 40W wired fast-charging system, and 15W wireless charging too. Battery life is truly excellent, easily beating out the competition, and removing all battery anxiety from your life. Nearly five months in, 24 hours of solid, heavy use is easily achievable while using airplane mode overnight will see it last two days in my experience, as will moderate use.EMUI has some battery saving measures to stretch any remaining amount out if you really need it, but I’ve simply never had the need to activate them. In our YouTube video benchmark test, I played a 1080p video on the P30 Pro with brightness at the max, and it managed to last a whopping 16 hours and 4 minutes. That puts every other phone to shame and is a massive selling point for the P30 Pro.The Huawei P30 Pro is not officially available in North America. It’s available in the U.K. through Huawei, online retailers, and most major networks, and throughout the rest of the world including Canada too. There are three versions: A 1,000 euro ($1,125) 8GB/128GB version, a 1,100 euro ($1,235) 8GB/256GB version, and a 1,250 euro ($1,405) 8GB/256GB version.Huawei provides a two-year warranty on the phone in the U.K. covering defects, but not wear and tear or mistreatment.Heightened media attention regarding Huawei and its presence on the U.S. Entity List may have caused some to question if buying a Huawei phone is a good idea. Huawei insists it’s business as usual at the company, and has announced several times that all warranties are operational, and software security updates will arrive too. The P30 Pro is also on Huawei’s list to receive the Android Q update.There is almost no photo you’ll want to take with a smartphone that the fabulous P30 Pro won’t be able to shoot, and when it does, it’ll likely deliver astonishing results. The camera’s supreme flexibility is matched by long battery life, strong performance, and the choice of some gorgeous colors schemes.Yes. The P30 Pro stands alone when it comes to the periscope zoom; but great camera phones are not a rarity these days. The $1,000 Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, the $800 Pixel 3, and the $1,100 iPhone XS Max are all worthy of attention, and have very capable cameras. The $750 OnePlus 7 Pro is a great alternative, with the best camera OnePlus has put on a phone, plus a really beautiful screen.The second half of 2019 will bring an exciting selection of phones to take on the P30 Pro. In the near future look out for the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, the next iPhone, and the Pixel 4, plus Huawei’s own Mate 30 Pro.The Huawei P30 Pro has an IP68 water resistance rating, so is reasonably resilient to the wet stuff, but the glass body is definitely a smash risk, so a case is advisable. The camera is cutting-edge, the processor is the latest from Huawei, and there is plenty of internal storage space. The hybrid SIM tray takes two SIMs, or a single SIM and one of Huawei’s own proprietary storage cards. There is no reason the phone will not remain capable and high performing for three to four years at least.Yes. The periscope zoom and incredible low-light performance makes it almost unique among top camera smartphones today, and are serious, genuine reasons to buy the P30 Pro. The battery life is also superb, and the additional list of features — from the capable in-display fingerprint sensor to the sleek design — cement the P30 Pro’s place as one of the most desirable smartphones released in 2019 so far.The slight caveat to the glowing recommendation is that the future of Huawei and Google’s partnership is still not clear. Huawei assures us the situation is under control, and that updates and services will continue; but a resolution has not been reached with the U.S. government at the time of writing. The temporary reprieve will end on August 19, and more will be known at that time. Even if this date passes with no solution in place, the P30 Pro will continue working, along with Google Play and all your apps, regardless.Updated on July 29, 2019: Added in further comments on the camera and its new modes, further battery details, and information on the ongoing Huawei situation. Several new night and lowlight images added."
55,IPhone 11,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/iphone-11-review/,"The iPhone 11 is all the iPhone you need, even with the new iPhone 12 arriving. Sure, the Pro models have an extra zoom lens, slightly better battery life, and nicer screens … but most people don’t need all of that. Save yourself $300 and go for the iPhone 11. It’s still one of the best iPhones and overall best phones you can buy right now.If you were hoping Apple would slim down the bezels on its successor to the iPhone XR, think again. Yes, the design is still a tremendous improvement over phones like the iPhone 8, but the front of the iPhone 11 is unchanged from 2018. A thick and uniform bezel surrounds the 6.1-inch screen and there’s the same wide notch at the top, carrying the TrueDepth camera and sensors for Face ID.Compare this to the OnePlus 7 Pro and its bezel-less screen, or the Galaxy Note 10 with its hole-punch camera, and the iPhone 11 looks a bit dated, but not terribly so.It’s not the perfect size — that’s the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro — but it’s not as unwieldy as the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The scale of the iPhone 11 marks a good middle ground for people who want a big screen but still want to manage the phone in one hand. It can be tricky trying to reach the back button, which is often on the top left corner, and that’s coming from someone with large hands.This iPhone feels substantial, and the glossy glass back isn’t as slippery as the matte finish on the Pro models. That said, you’ll want a case. It’s not as durable as the Pro models because it’s made of aluminum and not stainless steel. It does have an IP68 water resistance rating, so it can survive up to 2 meters underwater for up to 30 minutes.The best part of the new iPhone? The colors. There are six options and they all look wonderful (although the glass is still prone to fingerprints). My favorite is the green seen here, as well as the purple. Note that the iPhone branding has disappeared on the back, allowing for an even more minimalist look.The best part of the new iPhone? The colors. There are six options and they all look wonderful.I’m not as happy with the camera design. The two cameras are on a module that’s raised from the back glass; slide your finger from the rear glass to the edge of the camera module and you can feel how sharp it is. I wish the edge of the camera module blended into the rear glass.The huge cameras aren’t subtle, but they’re not as off-putting as the triple-camera lens setup on the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. I think if the additional raised module surrounding the lenses didn’t exist, I’d love the look of the iPhone 11. It’s growing on me, but I think the iPhone XR looks better.The weakest link is the 6.1-inch screen on the iPhone 11. It’s not an OLED panel like most competitors in this price range, and it has a mere 1,792 × 828 (326 pixels-per-inch, PPI) resolution.The OnePlus 7 Pro, which costs $20 less, has a 3,120 × 1,440 OLED screen with a 90Hz display, allowing for a smoother experience. Even the $399 Google Pixel 3a has a 2,220 × 1,080 resolution.Comparing the OnePlus 7 Pro’s screen and the iPhone 11, colors are richer and blacks are darker on the OnePlus, and a tad washed out on the iPhone. Comedian Hasan Minhaj looks flat on the iPhone screen as you can see in the comparison above.While the screen resolution is low, it’s hard to call that a problem. If you put the iPhone right in front of your eyes, sure, it’s easier to notice the difference. But that’s terrible for your eyes. Don’t do that!I had no trouble watching episodes of The Spy on Netflix, and the screen is bright enough for me to see almost everything clearly even in sunny conditions (it can go up to 625 nits, whereas the iPhone 11 Pro can go up to 800 nits).Still, the iPhone 11 doesn’t have a screen that matches its price tag. It falls short of the competition. No, it’s not bad, but you can find better at the same price or less.What about audio? There are stereo speakers for surround sound, and they sound vibrant. They’re not as loud as the speakers on the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, and they don’t sound as good, but they’re more than enough for gaming and watching movies. There’s still no headphone jack.Last year’s iPhone XR had a single lens and wasn’t versatile. That’s changing for the better with the iPhone 11, which now adds a 120-degree ultra-wide-angle lens, allowing you to capture more from a scene. This is a feature you won’t find on Google’s Pixel 4.But first, let’s talk about the main 12-megapixel sensor, which has an f/1.8 aperture and is the same as the main lens on the iPhone 11 Pro models. There are several improvements across the board, from autofocus that’s three times faster in low light conditions to better Smart HDR for more balanced shots in high-contrast lighting and a new feature called semantic rendering.This captures several underexposed photos before you tap the shutter button, and then an overexposed shot afterward. The camera attempts to understand elements of the photo, such as faces, and Smart HDR processes them separately using the frames it captured.With all of these improvements, the iPhone 11 has the best smartphone camera you can buy. It captures all the right details and some of the most natural colors you’ll see from a smartphone. It helps that the camera interface is so fluid it puts all other smartphone camera apps to shame.Yet the iPhone 11 isn’t a giant leap over the competition, especially compared to the Google Pixel 3. Apple is back on top, but only by an inch.I wish Apple did more with the new ultra-wide-angle camera. There’s just the right amount of distortion for unique photos, but I wish Apple went the extra mile and allowed autofocus. It’s a fixed focus lens, which means you need to be 1 meter away from the subject for it to be in focus. You can’t take close-up shots with it. Most competitors have this flaw as well, but it would have helped make Apple’s ultra-wide stand out.Photo quality from the ultra-wide angle lens is among the best, as you can see when compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The latter tends to oversaturate and often looks flat. The iPhone typically seems to pick up a bit more detail.The star of the iPhone 11’s camera is the new Night mode. It’s not a dedicated night mode like Google’s Night Sight on Pixel phones, but it automatically kicks in when it detects poor lighting conditions. You can turn it off, leave it on the automatic setting, or set it to the maximum long-exposure that the camera deems necessary. That can vary, but the camera can go all the way up to a 28-second exposure (if it’s dark enough and the phone is on a tripod).Most shots need a two- to three-second long exposure. Google’s Night Sight tends to decide for itself on how long the exposure should be on a variety of factors, but I prefer Apple’s approach, as it offers more choice. Night Sight delivers stronger details, but when opting for the maximum exposure on the iPhone, the results are comparable.What’s different is color. The iPhone 11 tends to maintain natural colors, while the Pixel can miss the mark. The iPhone’s Night Mode also tends to preserve the ambiance of a scene, lighting up certain parts of it, while the Pixel aggressively white balances the photo and brightens up everything. They’re two different approaches, and while sometimes I prefer the results of the Pixel 3, I largely have been enjoying the iPhone’s Night Mode even more.Apple has been at the back of the pack in low-light photography for some time, so it’s nice to see it race to the top. It is disappointing that Night mode doesn’t work on the selfie camera or on the ultra-wide-angle lens, which can be limiting when shooting at night because the ultra-wide has a narrower aperture than the main lens and it can’t take in as much light. It delivers muddy shots.There are several improvements to Portrait Mode. You can now take portraits of just about anything: pets, people, objects, whatever. On the iPhone XR, which had just a single lens, the camera was only capable of capturing portraits of people. The quality in these portrait photos are significantly better overall compared to last year’s iPhone XS Max, and it does a good job of maintaining the subject’s outline, though errors do turn up occasionally. That rings true with the new High Key Mono Portrait Lighting effect.The selfie camera has been upgraded to 12-megapixels over 7-megapixels on the iPhone XR, and they look better overall especially Portrait Mode selfies. You should know though, that by default selfies shot in portrait orientation will be captured in a cropped, 7-megapixel resolution. You can zoom out to take in more of the background when you want to take a group selfie (this automatically happens when you rotate the camera to landscape).Video upgrades to the iPhone 11 camera help Apple maintain its dominance in videography. The camera can shoot in 4K at 60 frames per second, and it does a good job with stabilization. I’m thoroughly enjoying Apple’s new Slofies, which capture 120 frames per second slow-motion selfies at 1080p. It’s unusual to see slow motion on the selfie camera, but it’s fun to use.The iPhone 11 is all about the camera upgrades. They shift Apple back on top. That being said, Google’s Pixel 4 is right around the corner and it means we’re in for a hell of a camera fight.Despite not having “Pro” in its name, you get the same performance on the iPhone 11 as the iPhone 11 Pro, because the entire range is equipped with Apple’s A13 Bionic chipset (though there’s only 4GB of RAM on the iPhone 11).Apps are quick to launch and scrolling through Twitter and Instagram is smooth. I’ve been playing quite a few games on Apple Arcade, the company’s new subscription-based game service, and titles like Oceanhorn 2: Knights of the Lost Realm and Skate City ran without any issues.Here are a few benchmark results:The AnTuTu result is our highest ever, beating out every Android smartphone running Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, the flagship chip of 2019. This is a powerful phone.I wish Apple stopped offering the 64GB storage size option and started with 128GB as the default instead. Samsung’s Galaxy S10 range starts with 128GB and has higher storage options from there, and the same rings true for the more affordable OnePlus 7 Pro. It’d be a nice move considering you still only get a meager 5GB of iCloud storage.On the software side, iOS 13 is wonderful. Dark mode makes everything beautiful and protects my eyes at night, the revamped Photos app is smarter and offers more robust editing tools, Face ID is faster than ever, and I love swipe typing. Check out my iOS 13 impressions for more.Apple claims the iPhone 11 lasts an hour more than the iPhone XR, which already had great battery life. That holds up. I ended an average workday with around 45 % left by 5 p.m., 30% by 7:30 p.m, and 15% by 10 p.m. That’s with medium use including playing a few games, taking photos, browsing the web, responding to notifications, and watching a YouTube clip or two.On a heavy day of use, where I took a ton of photos and videos with the iPhone 11’s camera for more than four hours, the 3,110mAh battery hit 15% by 5 p.m. — phones like the Google Pixel 3 would have long been dead. Most people will be satisfied.In our standard battery test, where we play a 1080p YouTube video over Wi-Fi with the brightness at max, the iPhone 11 lasted a paltry 4 hours and 54 minutes. But these tests aren’t perfect depictions of real-world battery life results, as the OnePlus 7 Pro lasted 11 hours and 50 minutes in the same test, but struggled to comfortably last a full day of use.The iPhone 11’s battery will easily last all day in most situations.Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t include the 18W fast charger in the box. Instead, you’ll find the traditional 5W charger, which will recharge your phone at a snail’s pace — it’ll take more than 3 hours to go from zero to 100. It does support fast charging, but only the iPhone 11 Pro models have the 18W brick in the box.You’ll need to spend around $50 more to buy the adapter and cable to enable this functionality, but it’s well worth it. The iPhone 11 managed to hit 50% in 30 minutes of charging with the fast charger, and more than 80% after an hour. Meanwhile, with the included cable and adapter it only hit 16% around the 30-minute mark. That falls short of the competition. Apple really should have made it standard.There’s still wireless charging, so you can sip up power by placing the phone on a wireless charging pad if you want.The iPhone 11 is $699 and it’s available from Apple as well as multiple retailers and carriers. You can pay for it in monthly installments with no interest, and if you’re coming from a previous iPhone, you can trade it in to get the price slashed up to $600 depending on the quality of the phone.Apple offers a standard warranty that covers the phone from manufacturer defects for one year from the date of purchase. You can extend the warranty with AppleCare+, for a price.If you’re hoping to find a discount, take a look at some of the best iPhone deals and smartphone deals available for Cyber Monday.The iPhone 11 delivers with day-long battery life, excellent performance, and a strong camera that’s more versatile than last year’s iPhone XR, not to mention all the improvements that come with iOS 13. If you don’t want to spend more than $1,000 on a new smartphone, the iPhone 11 is great value.If you’re sticking to iOS, yes. You can go for either the iPhone 11 Pro or the iPhone 11 Pro Max and they will be better in almost every way. They’re not the best value, however, so don’t feel bad if you just want to stick with the iPhone 11.Otherwise, the OnePlus 7 Pro is a great alternative at $679. It has great performance, a fantastic display, nice software, though the camera and battery aren’t as good.Google’s Pixel 4 is now available, and it’s a strong Android alternative. It has a camera system that’s nearly as good at a lower price. However, the Pixel 4 does lag in battery life.iPhones last a long time because of Apple’s lengthy software support. Expect the iPhone 11 to last you three to four years, if not more. When the battery starts to degrade, you can take it to certified Apple technicians to get it replaced and the phone will feel as good as new.Yes. If you’re not constantly on your phone all the time, the iPhone 11 is the phone to buy. If you are, look at the Pro models."
56,IPhone 11 Pro,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/iphone-11-pro-review/,"If you want the best in smartphone photography, look no further than the iPhone 11 Pro. In fact, there’s not another flagship phone I’d recommend for anything better right now.Design? Sure, but the matte finish glass looks and feels great. Price? Well, the iPhone 11 is $300 less and doesn’t sacrifice much, but that’s just Apple competing with itself.This is the most well-rounded iPhone I’ve ever used, with excellent battery life and a class-leading camera, which is something I haven’t been able to say for some time.The iPhone 11 Pro’s face is indistinguishable from last year’s iPhone XS, being built with the same notch at the top of the screen and thick bezels surrounding it. But as soon as you get it in your hands, you know it’s different.The first noticeable change is the weight and thickness. It feels like a thicker, heavier iPhone, and that’s because it is. The iPhone 11 Pro weighs 11 grams more than the XS. It’s not an objectionable weight for a phone, and I got used to it after a few minutes. Plus, the purported four-hour battery gains are owed to this bigger beltline.If you’re a fan of small phones, this is the one to get. The 5.8-inch screen size means the iPhone 11 Pro fits perfectly in the palm of my hand, and I don’t need to stretch my fingers to reach any part of the screen. It’s excellent.What you’ll notice next is the frosted glass back that’s less fingerprint-prone, a smooth and centered Apple logo, and, oh yeah, that enormous camera mound. Apple really wants you to know there’s three cameras in the back, which is why each one is not only raised individually with metal bezels, but the mound that houses them is also raised, carved from the same single piece covering the entire back of the phone. It’s not particularly good-looking, but you quickly get used to the look.There are curious omissions though, most irritating of which is the lack of a USB-C port. It would mean having to carry just one cable to charge all our devices. We’re all ready for it, Android phones have been using it for years, and Apple knows it’s inevitable — just look at its laptops. So, why not add it to this “Pro” device as it did with the most recent iPad Pro? The next omission is 3D touch. I’ll admit, I thought I never used 3D touch, but after losing it I learned how often I really did. Force pressing the camera and flashlight shortcuts on the lock screen transported you directly into the app with one relatively forceful click.I’m sorry I took you for granted, 3D touch. RIP.Pressing and holding to open these shortcuts via Haptic Touch, first introduced in the iPhone XR, not only takes longer but feels like a step-down — an odd feeling to have on the first iPhone “Pro.” I’m sorry I took you for granted, 3D touch. RIP.Apple said removing 3D touch made more room for increased battery capacity, and though I’ll lament the loss, I think more people will appreciate the battery gains.With a name like “Super Retina XDR,” the display improvements over the iPhone XS better be substantial — and they are. The iPhone XS’ OLED screen was already impressively balanced and vibrant, but the iPhone 11 Pro doubles the contrast ratio, improves HDR, and ups the max brightness to a 1,200-nit peak.You’ll usually only get up to 800 nits, as 1,200 nits is achieved when viewing HDR content. But all this adds up to a display you can easily view indoors and out, and dynamically adjusts to deliver the brightest highlights and inkiest blacks. Colors appear vivid but accurate, giving it a slight leg up on the impressive Galaxy Note 10, which in my eyes looks a bit over-saturated.It’s truly wonderful to look at and a joy to watch videos on, thanks to the sharp 2,436 x 1,125 resolution. If you watch a ton of movies and videos on your phone, it’s worth considering the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which offers up a much bigger 6.5-inch screen, but I’m satisfied with the screen size here. Apple said the new A13 Bionic chip has up to 20% faster CPU and GPU performance and the benchmarks corroborate this dominance. It’s the fastest phone we’ve ever tested, and playing games, working, or just flipping through music and social media will always be a fluid experience on the iPhone 11 Pro.Here are a few benchmark results:The AnTuTu score is the highest we have ever recorded on a smartphone, beating out phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus by almost 100,000. The only other phone to come close is the iPhone 11 — see what I mean about Apple competing with itself?iOS 13 brings us the long-awaited dark mode, as well as privacy-oriented features like Sign In with Apple, case-by-case permission of location access for apps, and a slew of other new features and improvements. Check out our iOS 13 in-depth impressions to get the full rundown, but as far as the iPhone 11 Pro goes, the operating system is as smooth as ever.Almost a full year after the introduction of Google’s magical Night Sight night-time picture mode on the Pixel 3 (and a number of manufacturers releasing their own versions in the interim) we finally have Apple’s take on this drool-worthy feature, along with a new ultra-wide-angle lens — the other piece of Apple’s camera game that has lagged behind competitors.Another new feature has been announced (but unfortunately is not yet live) called Deep Fusion. It’s meant for medium- to low-light photos specifically and machine learning algorithms will run a pixel-by-pixel analysis on pictures shot in this range, optimizing for detail, color, and sharpness. Sounds great, but unfortunately, we’ll have to wait to see how well and how quickly this worksApple now has its bases covered to regain photographic dominance, and I can say confidently that this triple 12-megapixel dream team is the best camera system out right now. Is it perfect? No. In the realm of top-tier smartphone cameras, every camera has its moments where a competitor’s shot just comes out better or more to your tastes. With the iPhone 11 Pro, those instances are far less common.Let’s just get this out of the way quickly: the iPhone 11 Pro takes absolutely exquisite day-time photos. Improved Smart HDR applies exposure adjustments to certain sections of a photo it recognizes (the sky, some flowers, etc.) and combined with semantic rendering, which takes four under-exposed shots before you click the shutter button, the shot you want, and one overexposed shot afterward to compose a result with the best detail and least noise. Altogether, the iPhone 11 Pro produces the best day-time shots you can get on a smartphone. Period. At night, in instances where Night mode isn’t necessary, the same remains true with its excellent exposure and detail capture, though grain can creep in quite a bit.With that out of the way, let’s get into Night mode. This automatic feature enables itself when the iPhone recognizes a scene dark enough to warrant it. With Night mode turned off on the Pro and compared to the iPhone XS, the results are a slightly brighter and better-looking picture. You can tweak the aggressiveness of Night mode by setting the exposure time to max, auto, or off, but this can only be tweaked within the parameters the iPhone deems fit. For instance, some scenes may be bright enough that it only allows a maximum one-second exposure time, even if that’s the auto setting as well. In much darker scenes, you can go for up to a 10-second or more exposure time, while the auto may opt for two or three. Most shots taken in the auto mode seem to fall in the one to two-second range.The main exception to this is when you’re taking pictures of the stars — something very few smartphones can do. For this, you’ll want to crank the exposure time up to the max and enjoy snapping photos iPhone users once thought were only possible with a DSLR. They’re not DSLR quality and have a substantial bit of noise, but the long exposure produces pleasing portrayals of the stars without brightening the sky to the point of a gray or blue smear.Adding some foreground to this equation does tend to make the skies look artificially blue and gray, though. In this regard, the Huawei P30 Pro might still take the prize for such shots for now, but further comparison is needed and I haven’t forgotten about the yet-to-be-released Pixel 4’s upcoming astrophotography mode. This could set the standard for starry night photography for the next year as Night Sight did for low-light photography last year. No matter what, we’re in for a treat comparing this year’s Night modes.In terms of functionality, once I started snapping nighttime pics, I never cared that Night mode can’t be turned on manually. Being automatic, you don’t ever end up enabling it in a situation where you’re forcing it to overstep its bounds and consequently produce a worse picture than were it not enabled. This is a common occurrence I’ve noticed with Night Mode on the Galaxy Note 10, for instance; sometimes you need to shoot in both modes to find out after the fact which mode was actually needed. Apple’s goal with Night mode, as it is with all of its camera features, is to give you the best chance at capturing that perfect shot without you having to think about it, and in almost every instance I found the iPhone 11 Pro delivering on that promise. Compared to Google’s Night Sight on the Pixel 3, the iPhone 11 Pro’s Night mode proved more photographically realistic in its interpretations of lighting while also capturing a little more detail than the Pixel 3. The iPhone’s Night mode makes scenes look as though a photographer set up professional studio lighting. It brings more balanced light to the whole scene, while intentionally highlighting certain areas of the shot and keeping already bright highlights in check, making it look more natural and aesthetically pleasing. Google’s Night Sight does an excellent job with a lot of this as well but quickly falls behind when dealing with bright spots in a dynamic scene, typically over-exposing these areas and making the shot appear overly-bright and artificial compared to the iPhone. It’s a difference you can see clearly in the background of these two photos.While they both expose and denoise the flowers and grass well, the iPhone makes the foreground a priority with lighting, giving the subject (the flowers) the spotlight, while the Pixel’s algorithm can’t help but pull your eyes away from the flowers with the extremely bright background areas. This is the difference that the iPhone 11 Pro makes: creating a nighttime photo that’s not just brighter, but more beautiful.Samsung still has some ground to make up on both Google and Apple, as its night mode is the least realistic and most likely to make a shot worse than better when it’s not an absolute necessity.Shooting photos with the iPhone 11 Pro’s new ultra-wide-angle camera is a ton of fun and affords the versatility I’ve enjoyed on flagship Android phones for a few years now. Apple’s implementation at this late stage, as always, means the company has done it a little differently and a bit better than the competition.Starting with distortion correction, the iPhone 11 Pro does enough to correct the curving of the picture’s edges typically seen on ultra-wide-angle cameras, without making the shot look awkwardly straight. It also preserves the elongation that makes ultra-wide photos so fun to shoot, striking a balance that inspires constant use of this camera. Especially in larger landscapes and enormous subjects, the ultra-wide-angle lens is a must, but even with scenes that don’t necessarily require it, switching to this camera after snapping the original photo became second-nature to me, just to see how cool it might look on the ultra-wide. A solid consistency between all three cameras (telephoto, wide-angle, and ultra-wide-angle) also helps to make switching less about the quality of the photo you want to take, and more about the style.There is a slight but noticeable quality downgrade with the ultra-wide-angle lens, though, specifically in lower-light scenarios due to the narrower f/2.4 aperture, compared to f/1.8 and f/2.0 on both the main and telephoto cameras, respectively, which let in more light and afford better detail and control of dynamic range.Aside from this, my only other gripe is that the lens has a fixed focus, which only focuses properly when the subject is at least a meter away. Most ultra-wide cameras on smartphones have this constraint, but it would have been nice for Apple to make its late debut a little more meaningful with a variable focus. On photos like the one of the car, I was forced to either take a step back or use the main lens, when all I wanted to do was get up close and elongate the car for a unique look. Unfortunately, that meant getting a shot with only a very small portion of the car barely in focus and the rest blurring up.The iPhone 11 Pro takes better portraits than ever before, accurately blurring out the background of a subject, while making it look natural (like from a DSLR). You won’t get this high level of accuracy with plants and other objects, but it still works reasonably well.One new addition is how you can now take Portrait mode photos with the main lens rather than being forced to rely on the telephoto lens. That means the quality of portraits has improved dramatically at night, as using the main f/1.8 lens means you can get more light, allowing for a better exposed photo. With an upgraded front-facing camera, the new 12-megapixel sensor ups the sensor size from 7 megapixels, but portrait selfies are set to snap at a cropped 7-megapixel size. You can either turn the phone to landscape or hit the zoom out button in portrait orientation to open up the view to the wider 12-megapixel format, but this can’t be done while in Portrait mode.Selfie portraits, as always, apply blur adeptly and now capture more detail with less smoothing.And the new Slofie (slow-motion selfie) feature is totally fun. Slowing down yourself and your background with 120 frames per second 1080p video creates a cool effect, especially when you’d like to show off where you are. Two things to be aware of: you can’t zoom out to a wider view as you can with selfies, and you won’t be able to do anything about overexposed backgrounds. You can also record regular selfie videos in up to 4K at 60 fps if that’s your thing — a first for the iPhone series.Speaking of slick videos, the iPhone 11 Pro certainly makes you feel like a film pro when you look at the videos you can film on this device. Shooting at 4K 60 FPS is incredibly smooth, especially with the iPhone 11 Pro’s improved “cinematic stabilization” which makes videos look gimbal-stabilized. Combined with the smooth zoom and high-quality imagery produced relatively consistently across the different lenses, it’s dead simple to shoot a gorgeous video on the iPhone 11 Pro, day or night.Yes, even with relatively heavy usage, you can often find yourself with enough juice to get through the night and charge when you get to work. With all my mixed usage, including work, social media, navigation, and Wi-Fi tethering, the least battery I had before heading to bed on an average workday was around 25%. I’d wake up with around 15%, just enough to support music streaming and web surfing through my 40-minute commute, then plug in when I get to work. Lighter users will easily be able to use the battery for longer on the second day.Our standard screen-on test puts the phone at maximum brightness and plays a 1080p video on Wi-Fi, where the iPhone 11 Pro scored 12 hours on the dot, with the Max clocking a little more than 10 and a half hours. While these tests aren’t a perfect indicator of day-to-day usage (our iPhone 11 lasted just about five hours in the same test but lasts easily through a day of use), this data paired with my usage indicates a strong battery prowess for the iPhone 11 Pro.Finally, we have an 18-watt charger in the box. Though charging speeds are much improved over the puny 5-watt chargers that took around three hours to charge the XS from zero to 100, it still took about 2 hours to fully charge the iPhone 11 Pro. This falls behind most fast-charging Android flagships that are closer to 90 minutes or less.The iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999 for a 64GB version, $1,099 for 256GB, and $1,199 for the 512GB. As always, you can pay for it outright or with interest-free monthly installments from Apple, your carrier, and most electronics retailers. Apple’s also offering trade-in deals that can take up to $600 off the price, depending on the condition and model of iPhone you’re trading in.The warranty is a standard one-year which covers defects only, though Apple does offer AppleCare+ for two years of accidental damage and defects, for an extra cost.The iPhone 11 Pro is an excellent smartphone that just works. It has the best cameras in the biz right now, and the device’s day-to-day performance and year-to-year support is unrivaled. Tack on a beefier battery that delivers results, and you have the all-around best smartphone in the game right now.You can certainly spend about $300 less and get the iPhone 11 with very similar performance, minus the telephoto camera and beefier battery. The screen is LCD, and isn’t as good, but satisfactory. The Google Pixel 4 is a formidable contender on the camera front, but it lacks the wide-angle lens found on the iPhone 11 Pro. It also doesn’t last as long on a charge.Consider the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus or Note 10, too. They’re beautiful phones, with solid camera systems, excellent screens, and great performance. Battery life isn’t as good, but you can charge them up much faster than an iPhone.With the iPhone’s unmatched length of software support, you can expect to keep your phone up to date for around four or five years. Battery life may start to degrade noticeably after two years, but replacements can be installed to breathe some new life into what will still be a good phone.Apple uses stainless steel on the Pro models, which is more durable, and it said the glass is stronger than ever. You might still want to slap on a case, though. IP68 water resistance has been fortified for 30 minutes at four meters as opposed to two meters.Yes. The iPhone 11 Pro is the best phone money can buy.

57,LG G8 ThinQ,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-g8-thinq-review/,"The problem with LG phones is how they’re priced far too high given their lackluster features. That’s the takeaway with the new LG G8 ThinQ. The phone has a lot of merits, but in LG’s attempt to differentiate, it went to great lengths to create a weird set of features no one asked for — and no one will use — while some of the device’s fundamentals could have still used some polish.The good thing is LG usually discounts its smartphones mere months after they launch, sometimes drastically. Pick up the G8 ThinQ when it’s $600 or less, and it’s an excellent phone. Until then, the competition is simply just better.The LG G8 ThinQ’s design is a bit generic — that is if you’re not using the Raspberry Red color option on T-Mobile. It comes in black and silver otherwise, and looks quite similar to last year’s G7 ThinQ. That’s no bad thing, but there’s just nothing flashy going on here. The bezels are slim, but there’s no hole-punch camera like you’ll see on some newer phones — just a notch.The edges on the back and front curve into the frame for a more ergonomic feel, and I like the flat sides, which helps with grip. The power button on the right side is easy to access, but the volume rocker feels a little tough to reach when using the phone with my right hand. The Google Assistant button, however, makes a return and it’s well-placed. There’s no native way to remap this button, but you can disable it if you don’t use Google Assistant.Design alterations on the G8 ThinQ are more visible on the rear. The dual-camera setup is aligned horizontally instead of vertically, and it’s not housed in a separate module — instead it’s under the same Gorilla Glass 6 that covers the back of the phone, making the camera completely flush. I love how this looks, though this elegance is slightly ruined by the flash that sticks out on the right.There’s a fingerprint sensor below the camera, and not much else. I’m grateful LG didn’t add an in-display fingerprint sensor like Samsung did on the Galaxy S10 for the sake of adding new technology, as it’s not as reliable yet.Watching shows like Our Planet on Netflix is breathtakingly gorgeous, and it helps that the audio sounds fantastic as well.The front of the phone has a 6.1-inch OLED screen protected by Gorilla Glass 5, with a sharp Quad HD+ (3,120 × 1,440) resolution. I have no qualms here. The screen looks sharp and it gets just bright enough to see it in direct sunlight. There’s support for HDR10 too, so colors look vivid, with inky blacks as deep as a black hole. Watching shows like Our Planet on Netflix is breathtakingly gorgeous, and it helps that the audio sounds fantastic as well. When compared to the Galaxy S10 (as seen below), the G8’s screen looks a little cooler.Speaking of sound, you may have noticed a missing earpiece at the top of the phone. It’s gone in favor of a piezoelectric vibrator, which produces sound through the display in a feature LG is calling “Crystal Sound OLED.” Not only does audio come through the screen, but the Boombox speaker from last year’s G7 is still present. You can fill a room with sound, and it’s loud enough to hear in busy environments outdoors as well. There’s decent bass, though the highs can feel strained at times. This does mean the phone vibrates a bit when you’re playing sound at full volume, though I’d say it adds to the immersive experience when you’re watching a movie or show.A headphone jack is still present, which will certainly make a good deal of people happy, though I’ve already transitioned to wireless earbuds and haven’t found much of a need for the port (don’t take that as an invite to ax it, LG!). There’s a Hi-Fi Quad DAC with support for DTS:X 3D, which means you get audio that sounds more spatial with the right headphones. As usual, audiophiles will love the LG G8.Now let’s get to the weird, marquee feature of the G8 ThinQ — Hand ID and Air Motion, which are enabled thanks to the front-facing camera, also known as Z Camera. It’s an 8-megapixel lens with an f/1.7 aperture, and it’s paired with a time-of-flight sensor. This sensor measures depth by seeing how long it takes light to hit a subject and come back, and LG is using it for biometrics as well as a new way to interact with the phone.The Z Camera allows for secure face unlock, so you can unlock the lock screen just by looking at it (similar to Apple’s Face ID on its latest iPhones). I used it in various lighting conditions, and it worked reasonably well — it even recognized my face when I had sunglasses on. Unfortunately, you can’t use Face Unlock to access secure services like a banking app or to authenticate a purchase in Google Pay, as these third-party apps need to add support for it. It’s a shame the feature is limited to the lock screen.The same rings true for a new unlocking method called Hand ID. If the phone is sitting flat on a desk, why raise it up so the camera can see your face? Just hover your palm over the Z Camera, and the sensor will recognize the vein pattern via an infrared sensor, and voilà — the screen will unlock. Or it should. It hardly worked for me. I spent countless minutes hovering my hand over the G8 ThinQ, as though I’m a puppet master trying to bring the phone to life, and Hand ID has worked maybe once out of 10 tries. Deleting my hand data a few times helped make it a little more reliable. But I’ve also only used it for the sake of using it for the review — there has never been a moment where I actually wanted to use my hand to unlock the phone; it’s just so unnatural.I’m hovering my hand over the G8 ThinQ, as though I’m a puppet master trying to bring the phone to life.Speaking of unnatural, paired along with Hand ID is a feature called Air Motion, which lets you use gestures to control the phone. Just like Hand ID, it’s awkward to use, but it was far more reliable in that Air Motion actually works. Hover your hand over the Z Camera, then make a claw-like gesture, and you can choose between two apps to open (you can set these to whatever you want).When media is playing, you can also do the same trick to pause/play, and twist your hand left or right to increase or decrease volume. Finally, you can even capture a screenshot using a pinching gesture.The question is, why? It’s 10 times faster to just pick up the phone and control it with touch. Even if the point is to use these gestures when your hands are dirty (when cooking in the kitchen, or if you’re in the bath), it’s still so awkward and slow to use Air Motion. After the first few days of trying all of this for the review, I slowly just stopped using it, and now Hand ID and Air Motion live as key selling points of the phone that I simply do not use. Thinking about the amount of resources and energy that went into making these two features work pains me. What a waste.Inside the G8 ThinQ is Qualcomm’s latest mobile processor for flagship smartphones — the Snapdragon 855. It’s the same chipset inside phones like the Galaxy S10 and the upcoming LG V50 ThinQ. There’s a sizable 6GB of RAM, which is likely more than you need, and 128GB of internal storage awaits. In case you need more space, there’s also room for a MicroSD card.Aside from the display, performance is the only other area of the LG G8 where I had zero issues whatsoever. Every action happened immediately as I moved my fingers across the screen — apps are quick to launch, multitasking is fluid, and gaming is smooth. Games such as Alto’s Odyssey ran without a hitch, and PUBG: Mobile ran at the highest graphical setting without problems. This phone will handle almost any app you throw at it without fail.Here are our benchmark scores:Those scores are very close to the Galaxy S10’s, which makes sense since it’s the same processor, and they trounce Android flagship phones running on last year’s processor, such as the Pixel 3. You have nothing to worry about here.My main LG G8 ThinQ review unit is an AT&T model, but I also spent a few days with the T-Mobile one. One thing that remained constant between the two was the sheer amount of bloatware on both phones. There are so many pre-installed apps that come on the carrier phones, and I wouldn’t be surprised if this was the case for the unlocked model as well. You can uninstall most of these apps, but some (like DirecTV or Game of Thrones: Conquest) can only be disabled. It’s annoying.You can uninstall most of these apps, but some can only be disabled. It’s annoying.The G8 ThinQ runs the latest version of Android 9 Pie, and the software experience is decent. After seeing Samsung improve its Android theme, I can’t help but wish LG did the same. Some parts of LG’s theme can look cluttered and feel clunky. Streamlining it down would improve the design overall, and maybe even help LG push software updates out faster.Last year’s G7 ThinQ already received the Android Pie update in select markets earlier this year, but take a look at the LG G7 subreddit on Reddit, and you’ll find people complaining about the lack of an update to the latest version of Android. Google released Android Pie in August 2018, and LG just announced it will bring Pie to other phones it released last year, like the LG V40 and the LG V35 ThinQ, in June. That’s close to a year later, which is terrible.Android Q’s second beta is in full swing, and Google will likely release it in August. With the LG G8, expect to wait a long time before receiving the update. This is not a phone to buy if you want the fastest updates and the latest version of Android — get a Google Pixel phone instead.Not too much has changed with the cameras on the rear of the phone. It’s a standard, 12-megapixel lens with an f/1.5 aperture and optical image stabilization, paired with a 16-megapixel wide-angle lens with an f/1.9 aperture and 107 degrees field of view.It’s quite a capable camera, actually. Details are strong in good lighting, and the wide-angle camera boosts creativity as you try to vary up your shots. My biggest issue with the G8 is its HDR, which I made sure to turn on in the camera’s settings. HDR helps mitigate the overblown sky you see in a few of these photos above, creating a well-exposed image rather than one that’s extremely blown out in one area or terribly dark in another. It’s very hit-and-miss when it wants to work, as there are some photos where it does a good job.With the wide-angle lens, colors can look a little strange, and detail deteriorates fast in low light. Thankfully, that’s not so much the case with the main lens, which is aided by a new mode called Night View. In this mode, the G8 ThinQ can go toe-to-toe with phones like the Google Pixel 3 and the Galaxy S10 (but probably not the Huawei P30 Pro). Night View takes multiple photos and fuses them to create a better-exposed image. Take a look below at how it stacks up:			The Pixel 3’s Night Sight feature illuminates the darkest areas, but it makes colors look unnatural. The G8’s photo is the most detailed, and it does a great job of keeping the exposure of the grocery store on the bottom right in check.You’ll be met again with poor HDR in Portrait Mode and with the 8-megapixel selfie camera. There are just too many blown-out images, and Portrait Mode, which blurs out the background behind a subject, isn’t the most accurate. Not only does it take some time to lock onto a subject, but it often messes up the outline around them.			While you can definitely take some excellent photos with the LG G8 ThinQ, there are some consistency issues that keep it from being a great camera. It also doesn’t have the best HDR, the phone’s camera menu isn’t the most intuitive, and while the wide-angle lens is fun, it delivers inaccurate colors sometimes, along with poor detail in low light.						The video features are a little more interesting, because there’s a new one that lets you capture Video Portraits. It essentially adds a blur effect behind a subject in real time (like Portrait Mode), and while it does look wonky — particularly when subjects are moving — it does add a neat look, as though you’re manually adjusting the focus on a DSLR.						There’s also Cine Video, which I’ve been a fan of ever since it was introduced on the LG V30. It lets you add different color gradients to videos, and the pan and zoom feature lets you focus on a subject and smoothly zoom in on them, like a cinema camera.  It’s a fun video camera to explore.Battery life on the LG G8 ThinQ is similar to my experience with phones like the Google Pixel 3, averaging about 3 hours of screen on time on a typical workday. The G8 went from 100 percent around 8 a.m. to dead by 9 p.m., which is not great. If you will be away from a charger after work, it’s more than likely the phone will die before the night ends.Thankfully, it supports wireless charging, so it’s even easier to keep to topped up during the day.In our battery test, where I played a YouTube video in 1080p over Wi-Fi with maximum brightness, the LG G8’s 3,500mAh battery lasted for 8 hours and 40 minutes. It’s respectable, but the Samsung Galaxy S10, which has a smaller battery and costs a little more, lasted a decent bit longer. Thankfully, it charges relatively quickly. The G8 ThinQ supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology, and it took us an hour and 37 minutes for it to go from 0 to 100 percent.Battery life isn’t atrocious, but on days where you’ll need to use the phone heavily, the G8 ThinQ will undoubtedly give you battery anxiety.The LG G8 ThinQ costs $850 for the unlocked model and goes on sale April 11. Pricing is actually a bit confusing, as almost all retailers and carriers are selling the phone at a discounted price already — B&H and Best Buy have it for $700. Verizon is selling the phone at retail price for $840, but if you lock into a 2-year contract, you can pay $20.42 per month for 24 months, which amounts to $490. Whereas AT&T is selling it for $27.67 per month for 30 months, or $830. From T-Mobile, it’s $620, or $25.84 per month for 24 months. It’s all very bizarre, but you can check out our buying guide for the full details.LG offers a two-year warranty that covers manufacturer defects, but you need to make sure to register the phone to ensure coverage for the second year.The LG G8 ThinQ is a fine phone that doesn’t match its retail price tag. There’s no one particular thing it excels at, and the marquee feature is a total gimmick. At $850, it doesn’t excite the way a phone this price should, and it’s worth skipping for other, better alternatives. Looking for more options? We’ve compiled the best smartphone deals for you to check out.Yes, granted this is if you’re thinking of paying $850 for the phone, since price is varying by retailer. I think there are two top alternatives you should consider: The Google Pixel 3, which costs $800 but can likely be found for cheaper, and the Samsung Galaxy S10e, which is $750. The Galaxy S10e has a very similar camera setup as the G8 ThinQ — a standard lens paired with a wide-angle one — and while battery life isn’t its strong suit like the G8, it’s a far better value. The Pixel 3 has a far more reliable and stronger camera, and while it won’t match performance, it’s still fast and has a much better software experience.If you’re open to iOS, you should also check out the iPhone XR, which is $750, and is also a great value. And if you’re considering phones in this price range, you should know the absolute best at the moment is the Galaxy S10 Plus, but that’s $1,000, which may be too big of a price tag. You may check out the spec comparison we did for the Galaxy S10 and G8 ThinQ if you’re curious about how their features stack up.If you’re looking at the LG G8 and it has a price tag around $600 (like on T-Mobile), I think it’s a much more reasonable buy. Check out our best smartphones guide for more.The LG G8 ThinQ is wrapped in Gorilla Glass 5 and 6, which means it’s tough, but it’s still glass. A case is a smart idea to keep it protected. It’s also IP68 water- and dust-resistant, so it will survive a dunk in the pool. In terms of updates, they will come, but expect Android version updates to be slow. You likely won’t get Android Q this year at all. I expect the phone will last three to four years before you’ll want to upgrade it.Not for $850, as there are far better options out there. LG has a history of dropping prices on its phones soon after launch — many retailers are already selling it at a discount — and if the G8 ThinQ costs $600 or less, it’s a solid buy."
58,LG V50 ThinQ,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-v50-thinq-5g-review/,"You should not buy a 5G phone this year. Coverage is too spotty, with a lot of caveats, and it doesn’t help that 5G phones are overpriced. It’s fun to watch a nearly 2GB game download in 25 seconds, but the next-gen network technology is not worth the price of admission. Yet.The LG V50 ThinQ doesn’t change that. It doesn’t offer much new over last year’s LG V40 ThinQ, which makes it dull, and the competition offers better features for less. It’s the first phone from LG to support 5G, which is why its $1,152 price (on Sprint) is so high. That’s why you should skip it.Ok. Let’s talk 5G.The V50 ThinQ is a 5G phone, but it’s only available through Sprint and Verizon right now. There’s no unlocked version. It’s also not interoperable, so if you buy the V50 ThinQ from Sprint, it will not work on Verizon’s 5G network (and vice versa). That’s because Sprint’s V50 utilizes mid-band spectrum while Verizon’s model opts for millimeter wave (mmWave). Check out our guide explaining the different spectrum variants for 5G for more, and our in-depth explainer on 5G is worth a look.You can only buy the V50 ThinQ in cities where 5G is available. That’s for the best, as there’s no reason to shell out over $1,000 for the V50 if you can’t access 5G. It works on 4G LTE, but 5G support is the phone’s killer feature.I’ve tested the V50 ThinQ on Sprint’s 5G network in Dallas and saw download speeds hovering around 350Mbps. That’s not the quickest around. However, Sprint’s mid-band spectrum 5G works in a broader area. I haven’t tested the V50 on Verizon’s 5G network, but you should expect higher speeds thanks to mmWave (500Mbps-1Gbps), which should resemble my tests with the Galaxy S10 5G (also mmWave). However, mmWave has limited range. When I tested the Galaxy S10 5G, I noted that 5G dropped back to 4G LTE when I entered buildings, or even went more than a block away from the 5G node.I’ll update this review when Sprint’s 5G comes to New York City, which will let me test 5G connectivity for prolonged use. This review is based on the V50 ThinQ connected to 4G LTE.If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That’s what I presume LG’s design team thought when designing the V50, as it has (almost) the same look as the LG V40. What is new? There’s a gaudy 5G logo at the top of the rear that lights up yellow when the phone is connected to 5G (or when it feels like it). It’s tacky.I do love the flush camera design. It rests under the Gorilla Glass 6 back, and the casing that surrounds it has been removed, which makes the triple-lens setup elegant and clean. An easy-to-access fingerprint sensor sits below.Watching movies and playing games is a joy, and the screen is bright enough to see in sunny conditions. It’s excellent.The V50 isn’t unwieldy for its size. The curved edges on the back and front make it feel comfortable to hold. You will need to adjust how you hold the phone to reach the top corners of the screen. It’s light, but that can make it feel less substantial than the Galaxy S10 5G.The front is protected with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5, and you’d be hard-pressed to find a difference with the design next to the V40. That’s disappointing, as other phone-makers like Samsung and OnePlus have managed to offer the latest styles on new phones instead of recycling the same look. There’s no hole-punch or pop-up camera here, just a notch — which is so 2018.A button on the left edge of the phone accesses Google Assistant. I use Assistant a lot, but I didn’t use the button much — your mileage may vary. Sadly, you can’t remap it.The screen is a highlight. It’s a vast 6.4-inch OLED with sharp 3,120 x 1,440 resolution. It’s detailed, colorful, and delivers deep blacks. Watching movies and playing games is a joy, and the screen is bright enough to see in sunny conditions. It’s excellent.The audio setup is great, too. You get stereo speakers, and LG’s “Boombox” feature from last year’s LG G7 makes a return. If you place the phone on certain surfaces (like a hollow box or a wood table), audio is amplified and room-filling. It doesn’t beat the Razer Phone 2, but it’s a good alternative if you don’t have a Bluetooth speaker.The V50 also supports DTS:X 3D surround sound, has a 32-bit Quad DAC, supports hi-res audio files, and has a headphone jack to tie it all together. You’ll have a great time listening to music with this phone.Like most Android flagship phones of 2019, the V50 ThinQ is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor with 6GB of RAM. It’s a powerful chip, and I have yet to run into any issues.Here are a few benchmark results:It can’t match the OnePlus 7 Pro, a leader in our tests at the moment, but it comes close to other Snapdragon 855 chips like the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.Games like Alto’s Odyssey, PUBG: Mobile, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, and Pako: Forever ran without a hitch on the V50. You won’t have any problems running the latest apps on this phone for years to come.The V50 ThinQ runs Android 9 Pie, and while LG’s skin over it looks alright, it’s not my favorite.Quickly switching between apps is always a hit-or-miss experience. It tends to skip over a few apps and opens another app completely. It’s the only phone where I’ve ever noticed this issue. The App Drawer is also frustrating. Anytime I installed an app, I had to manually sort it “Alphabetically,” because it would keep adding new apps to the very end of the list. Just…why?I can’t forget to mention that I had to manually customize the camera app interface for it to make sense. By default, you must swipe various modes all the way to the left to get to the More menu, all just to tap on features like Night View. I realized later you can customize the interface to make your most-used features more accessible, but the overflow menu shouldn’t be so far away by default. It’s unintuitive.I wasn’t a fan of the five cameras on the LG V40 ThinQ, so I expected little from the LG V50, which has the same camera setup. However, LG has improved image processing, so results have improved.The V50 has a triple-camera lens system on the back comprised of a 12-megapixel f/1.5 standard lens (with optical image stabilization), a 16-megapixel f/1.9 wide-angle lens, and a 12-megapixel f/2.4 telephoto lens. The best part of this phone’s camera is its versatility. Want a close-up? The telephoto lens offers a 2x optical zoom. Want to take it all in? Switch to the wide-angle lens for a 107-degree field of view.Photos from all three lenses are detailed in good lighting. Colors veer toward oversaturation, but they’re otherwise close to accurate. It’s low-light situations where the wide-angle and telephoto lens start to falter. The standard does better, but grain pops in and images can be blurry.That’s why LG has added Night View mode, which captures multiple images together and stacks them to produce one strong photo. It works well, though you need to stand still when capturing photos in this mode. It’s not as good as the Google Pixel 3a’s Night Sight, but comes close.Portrait Mode on the V50 does a great job of making the blur outline around a subject look natural, but I’ve found it wildly overexposes the image in high-contrast scenarios. The bokeh effect doesn’t look as appealing as the ones on other phones.A new feature called Portrait Video works when you’re in Portrait Mode on the camera — tap the video record button, and it will add a bokeh effect around a subject while filming. The same feature is on phones like the Galaxy S10 5G and the Huawei Mate 20, and I’ve yet to see it work perfectly. Errors are common and obvious.You’ll find two selfie cameras on the V50. One is an 8-megapixel lens with an f/1.9 aperture, and the other a wide-angle 5-megapixel lens with an f/2.2 aperture. The latter lets you capture more in a shot, which is great for group selfies.Selfies look good in good lighting but can be overexposed. Selfies can also look a little soft and not entirely in focus. The sharpness issues become more obvious in poor lighting.The LG V50 ThinQ takes decent photos, but it doesn’t match phones like the Google Pixel 3 and Pixel 3a (which are less expensive).The V50’s Achilles’ heel is battery life. With average use, I ended work days with around 30 percent by 7 p.m. If I took the phone out for longer, it would be dangerously close to dying by the end of the day. Heavier usage saw it drop much faster, and I’d need to plug it in before the day ended.It’s a 4,000mAh battery, but keep in mind I’ve maxed out the resolution and toggled most of the features on. If you leave it at the default resolution, your battery life will be better.In our battery test playing a 1080p YouTube video on max brightness over Wi-Fi, the LG V50 managed to last 10 hours and 30 minutes before dying. That’s a decent result, but it’s not as good as other phones with similarly sized batteries. The Galaxy S10 Plus (4,100mAh) lasted 12 hours and 40 minutes; the Huawei P30 Pro (4,200mAh) lasted 16 hours and 4 minutes; and the Google Pixel 3a XL (3,700mAh) lasted 10 hours and 45 minutes.While testing Sprint’s 5G network in Dallas, the phone’s battery dipped to around 50 percent after 3 to 4 hours of intensive testing. It’s difficult to gauge what battery life will be like on 5G without prolonged testing.When it comes time to recharge, you’ll find support for Qi wireless charging and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 for faster wired charging.The LG V50 ThinQ is available from Sprint for $1,152, and $1,000 from Verizon, or $41.66 for 24 months. It’s unavailable unlocked, and the device is not interoperable, so 5G will only work on the carrier you bought the device from. You can only buy the phone in the cities where 5G is available on Sprint.LG offers a two-year warranty on its devices, though you’ll need to register your device online to ensure coverage for the second year within 90 days of purchase.LG’s V50 ThinQ is not exciting, but it’s a good phone that satisfies in almost every department. Its spotlight feature is 5G, but it’s not yet time to buy a 5G phone, and that sadly makes the phone overpriced.If you’re looking for a 5G phone, your options are limited. There’s the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, which is similarly overpriced, but there’s also the cheaper Moto Z4 or Moto Z3 with the 5G Moto Mod. Those are limited to just Verizon’s network, though, and they’re not as strong options.If you’re looking for a good flagship phone, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, iPhone XS, or Google’s Pixel 3. If you don’t need all the bells and whistles and just want a good phone without breaking the bank, the Google Pixel 3a is your best option at just $400. The OnePlus 7 Pro and Asus ZenFone 6 are powerful and good choices to consider, but their cameras aren’t as good.Check out our best smartphones guide for more.The LG V50 ThinQ is covered in glass, so a case is a necessity if you want to prevent scratches and cracks in the event of an accidental drop. Thankfully, it’s IP68 water resistant, so it will survive a dip in the pool.LG’s track record with Android version updates is spotty. The V50 ThinQ will get Android Q, but the question is when? The LG V40 ThinQ only just got Android 9 Pie on the unlocked model, so it’s likely you’ll have to wait more than six months for the next Android version after Google releases it.No. It’s a good phone, but the V50 ThinQ is overpriced for what it offers. 5G networks may be live, but the speeds and coverage are not worth shelling out more than $1,000 for a phone at the moment."
59,Moto G7,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/moto-g7-review/,"When Motorola launched the G series back in 2013 it redefined expectations of a budget phone. The first few releases easily retained the budget crown, but the competition is getting much tougher. A resurgent Nokia brand under HMD Global is turning out truly impressive, cheap smartphones; and Honor is not the only threat from the east. Not to mention that Motorola releases so many phones it sometimes feels like it’s competing with itself – this year, there’s a Moto G7 Play, a G7 Power, and a G7 Plus in some markets.The Moto G7 enters this budget melee confidently, looking every bit the champion. But at $300 it has some work to do to prove its worth, because the original Moto G was just $180. But then this is the age of $1,000 flagships, and what the G7 does that its ancestor could not is pass for a much more expensive phone.With a white, curved glass back, a sparkling silvery metal frame, and a large display with a teardrop notch, the Moto G7 looks quite good. It has provoked some admiring glances and even a few enthusiastic comments during the time I’ve been using it, followed by no small surprise at its budget status. Many more expensive phones have failed to get a similar response, but I do feel the white model I received for review is by far the prettiest color option.The shining M logo on the back doubles as a fingerprint sensor, and Motorola has stuck with its signature, round camera module above, which instantly makes it stand out as a Moto phone. It still protrudes more than I’d like. A case can solve this, though, and it may be well worthwhile considering the glass back.You’ll find the textured power button on the right spine with a volume rocker above. The bottom edge is home to a USB-C port, flanked by a 3.5mm audio jack and a speaker grill. I’m delighted to see USB-C make its way into budget phones.The display is large, with a teardrop notch at the top for the front-facing camera. The bezels are slim and there’s a slightly bigger chin at the bottom that bears the Motorola name.The 6.2-inch LCD screen looks impressive. It’s comfortable to read on and it’s good for watching movies. The resolution is 2,270 x 1,080 pixels, which translates to 403 pixels per inch. That’s actually slightly lower than last year’s Moto G6 which had 424 pixels per inch, but it’s largely because the display is now half an inch bigger, and it’s still sharp enough.The Moto G7 enters this budget melee confidently, looking every bit the champion.It doesn’t quite hit the high notes of a major competitor, the Nokia 7.1, which boasts a slightly sharper screen with HDR10 support. If you watch the right content on Netflix or Amazon, you’ll see a difference in quality. What I don’t like about the Moto G7 display is the amount of backlight that comes through in a darkened room. If you watch movies in the dark this can be distracting, but sadly OLED screens have not made it into too many budget phones yet.The colors aren’t bad, but by default they look pretty saturated. You can tweak the display in the settings if you prefer a more natural look. Brightness can be an issue with budget phones and the Moto G7 is no exception. In direct sunlight, it becomes a little difficult to read what’s on screen, though you can crank that brightness higher if you turn off adaptive brightness in the display settings.I’m being picky as these criticisms apply to the majority of phones in this price range. The design and display of the Moto G7 are definite high points.The Moto G7 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 processor inside with 4GB of RAM. That’s a major step up from the Moto G6, which is good because I found last year’s phone sluggish.It’s clearly a step up on its predecessor in terms of performance.Swiping around is smooth and apps and games are fairly quick to load. Asphalt 9: Legends does look a bit pixelated, partly because the screen is big and partly because the game chose a lower graphical quality by default. I cranked the visual quality up to see how the Moto G7 handled itself and it did well. There was the occasional dropped frame, but nothing more serious than that.I also tried out Hello Neighbor which didn’t run well, though that may be down to the game rather than the phone. There were no issues with Super Mario Run.Here are some benchmark results:It’s clearly a step up on its predecessor in terms of performance, but the Moto G7 doesn’t quite hit the same level as the Nokia 7.1, which has the slightly better Snapdragon 636, though it’s not far away.There’s 64GB of storage available on the Moto G7, which will be plenty for most people, but there’s room for a MicroSD card should you need more space.Unfortunately, I did encounter a couple of issues with the Moto G7. In the first four days. it crashed three times with no obvious cause. Wi-Fi seemed to cut in and out inexplicably for the first two days and I could unearth no reason in the settings, but then it sorted itself out. The G7 also got stuck in a weird loop where it kept suggesting the battery was low and I should turn on the battery saver, but it was actually plugged in and charging at the time. I had to restart the phone to stop this message popping up. I suspect these issues are down to the software rather than the hardware.The Moto G7 runs Android 9.0 Pie, but with Motorola’s user interface on top and a couple of preinstalled apps – your mileage may vary in this department depending on where you buy the phone. It used to be a point to praise Moto phones for having close to stock Android, but it feels like more and more things have been creeping in and I’m not convinced they’re all useful.I like some of the camera options, which I’ll get to in the next section. There are lots of Moto Actions to choose from, which are gestures that act as shortcuts. Chop for flashlight and flip for do not disturb are great, but there are some relatively useless options in there too.There are also display options to keep it on while you’re looking at it, and to peek at and interact with notifications on the lock screen. Moto Voice, which can read your text messages out loud, rounds things out. You may or may not find some of this stuff useful.What concerns me is a suspicion that the software tweaks actually negatively impact the phone’s performance. I haven’t encountered crashes or other weird issues with Android One phones, for example. While that’s speculative, what’s not in doubt is that Android One phones are guaranteed to get at least two years of Android version updates and three years of security updates. The Moto G7 will likely get Android Q, but beyond that I’m doubtful it will see another update.Weighing up the extras Moto offers, they’re not worth the problems they bring. Customers would be better served if the Moto G7 was an Android One device, and I’d like to see more budget phones signed up to the program.It’s also very disappointing to see there’s no NFC support for Google Pay in the U.S. Moto G7 model, which is especially strange as the European version does have it. The $160 Nokia 3.1 Plus has NFC, so there’s really no reason it couldn’t be included here.On paper, the Moto G7 has the same camera suite as the Moto G6, comprising a 12-megapixel lens with an f/1.8 aperture, and a 5-megapixel secondary lens for depth. The front-facing camera is rated at 8-megapixels.This is a decent camera for the money. If conditions are good with plenty of light, you’ll be able to capture lovely landscape shots or close ups. Colors are quite good and fairly true to life, but it does really struggle with contrast. If there’s a bright area in the scene, it will often be blown out and overexposed.What I really like about the Moto G7’s camera is the portrait mode, which I think is important to most people because they want to capture great shots of family and friends. It’s not perfect, but it usually creates a good blurred background and comes close to nailing the outline of the subject to keep them in sharp relief. I can forgive the mistakes because the results are generally photos I want to share.It’s important both subject and photographer are still, however, or you’ll get blurry results. In fact, you’ll generally need a steady hand when snapping photos with the Moto G7 because it lacks optical image stabilization (OIS).I like some of the extras in the camera app, such as Spot Color, which allows you to tap one color and turn everything else black and white. The Cinemagraph option is also cool, allowing you to make a short animated GIF and choose which area should move, while it freezes the surroundings. It’s tough to get good results though, and it’s the sort of gimmick you might try once and never use again.On the negative side, low light is a big issue for this camera. It simply can’t capture any detail and things get very noisy, very quickly when darkness falls. I would trade all the gimmicks for better low light performance if I could.The front-facing camera is perfectly adequate for selfies or video calls. The Moto G7 can also capture 4K and timelapse videos.As you’d expect with a 3,000mAh battery on board, the Moto G7 can make it through an average day just fine. It does have a big screen, though, so nightly charging will be the norm for most people.In our battery test it managed to run for 8 hours and 27 minutes which is a respectable result.I’m glad it has a USB-C port for charging, and Motorola’s Turbo Charge standard is fast – you can go from zero to around 80 percent in an hour. It charges fastest between 20 and 80 percent, so you can get a useful amount of juice in just 15 minutes as long as it’s over 20 percent when you plug in.Sadly, wireless charging has not made its way into the budget phone scene just yet, even though the Moto G7 has a glass back.The Moto G7 costs $299 and you can buy it direct from Motorola or from retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. You will also find it at Google Fi, Republic Wireless, and Ting.You get a standard one-year limited warranty for manufacturing defects and faults. If you buy from Motorola, you do have an option to add extended support with Moto Care for another year for $30, or accident protection at $40 for 15 months or $65 for two years, which includes free shipping.The Moto G7 is designed to appeal to everyone with a $300 budget for their next smartphone. It features an attractive design that looks and feels more expensive than it is, with a good display, solid performance, and a mostly decent camera. Software wobbles and that low light camera performance are the big disappointments.Yes, the Nokia 7.1 would be our pick as it has Android One, a better camera, and NFC support, though it does cost $50 more.If you want longer battery life and the camera is not as important, then you can save yourself $50 with the Moto G7 Power. If you don’t mind a cheaper build and smaller screen, then the Moto G7 Play is $100 less.You should certainly buy a case if you want the Moto G7 to last. I don’t think you’ll get more than two years from this phone, even if you take care of it, and I worry about the time you may have to wait for software updates.If you like the design and you want a big screen, the Moto G7 could be your best bet at this price. It’s also a great choice for anyone upgrading from older Moto phones, assuming you liked them. If you can scrape together an extra $50, buy the Nokia 7.1 instead."
60,Moto Z4,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/moto-z4-review/,"The Moto Z4 is not an exciting phone. It doesn’t bring anything new to the table, and at $500, you can buy similarly-priced phones with more compelling features, like the Google Pixel 3a or the Asus ZenFone 6.That doesn’t mean it’s a bad phone. The Moto Z4 offers solid performance, a large battery, a promising camera, and a nice software experience. You can still use Moto Mods, and some are genuinely useful. But at the end of the day, the Z4 is priced a little high. You should only buy this phone if you’re on Verizon’s network, as it’s available for $400 if you’re an existing customer and you’re upgrading (and even less if you’re switching to Verizon).The Moto Z4 looks a lot like its predecessors. That’s because it maintains the modular system so Motorola’s Moto Mods can magnetically attach to the back of the phone. The phone’s dimensions needed to be similar so Moto Mods that worked on the Moto Z3 or original Moto Z can work flawlessly on the Z4. That’s great if you already own a few mods and are planning on upgrading from an older Moto Z phone.Motorola offers 16 Moto Mods at the moment, with the most recent being the 5G Moto Mod. No new Moto Mods are launching with the Moto Z4, which is disappointing. Still, I’ve always liked Motorola’s implementation of mods. They’re easy to snap on and use. I can only recommend a few mods, though, such as the battery mod for longer battery life, the JBL Soundboost 2 speaker mod for blasting music, the wireless charging mod, and the Polaroid Insta-Share Printer mod. I’ve been using the wireless charging mod on my Moto Z4, as I have wireless chargers around my house and at work. It’s convenient, but charging speed is slow.The phone’s back boasts etched matte glass (Gorilla Glass 3), and it feels nice. The matte texture eliminates ugly smudges and fingerprints, and it’s difficult to tell it’s a glass back. At the very bottom are pogo pins that are required for data transmission between Moto Mods and the phone. There’s also a large and ugly camera bump, but that disappears if you slap on a Moto Mod case.The display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 as well, and Motorola has jumped on the bezel-less and notch bandwagon. The edges surrounding the screen are slim, and that delivers a larger 6.39-inch display while maintaining nearly the same body size as the Moto Z3 (which has a 6-inch screen). This makes apps and other content look good. It’s an OLED display with 2,340 x 1,080 resolution, and it looks sharp, with strong colors and deep blacks. The screen is bright for most conditions, but can be tough to see in direct sunlight.The Moto Z4’s screen is cooler and better white balanced over the Pixel 3a XL. Screen resolution is similar, though the Moto Z4 does offer higher brightness levels. Comparing speakers is an entirely different story. The Moto Z4 has top-firing speakers that are too easy to block when holding the phone in landscape mode. The Pixel 3a XL has two speakers — one front facing and one bottom-firing — and not only is it louder, but it also delivers richer sound. You definitely need a speaker Moto Mod if you want a good experience.The Moto Z4 offers solid performance, a large battery, a promising camera, and a nice software experience.While I like the feel of the Moto Z4, it’s a bit difficult to reach the top of the screen; this is a two-handed phone. Things get worse when you permanently attach Moto Mod to the back — like the wireless charging mod — as the 2.5D curved edges make the mods feel like they’ve been taped on. They don’t fit like a glove like on previous Moto Z phones.Gone is the sensor that used to sit on the side of the phone. It’s now under the display, a move we’ve seen from several handset-makers already, including Samsung. It’s an optical in-display fingerprint sensor, and Motorola said it performs as reliably as the capacitive sensor in Moto Z phones before. My tests say otherwise. The scanner is better than the likes we’ve seen on the OnePlus 6T or the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, but it’s still not as reliable as traditional fingerprint scanners.I initially had a lot of trouble getting it to work, but the trick is to scan your fingerprint multiple times; it works a lot better. I still wouldn’t call it reliable, and I would rather have a side-mounted sensor again instead of one under the glass.Thankfully, there’s a face unlock option that works well, though it’s not secure and can’t be used to authenticate payments or access sensitive apps — unlike Apple’s Face ID.The right side of the phone has a textured power button below a volume rocker. You can double tap the power button to trigger Google Assistant by default, which is a nice touch. On the bottom edge is a USB-C charging port, alongside — wait for it — a headphone jack! Yes, Motorola took out the headphone jack in the Moto Z, but it’s making a comeback in the Moto Z4. Why? Customers complained. It’s nice to see Motorola listening to feedback.Motorola has stuffed Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 675 processor inside the Moto Z4 with 4GB of RAM. This gives me mixed feelings. On the one hand, phones like the Pixel 3a (which has the Snapdragon 670) hardly had any issues, even when playing games like PUBG: Mobile. This rings true with the Moto Z4. It performs admirably. Games like Pako Forever, PUBG: Mobile, and Alto’s Odyssey run smoothly, with the occasional stutter. I did notice the Moto Z4 does tend to get warm quite quickly, which means prolonged gaming may be an issue as the processor will throttle performance.The Pixel 3a is $400, though. For around the same $500 price as the Moto Z4, you can buy the Asus ZenFone 6, which packs the flagship Snapdragon 855 processor — the same chip that’s inside the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and other high-end phones. That chipset is much faster and will hold up better as the years pass by.Here are a few benchmark results:The OnePlus 7 Pro, which is $680, has much better scores, and the Asus ZenFone 6’s numbers also fly by the Moto Z4. The Z4 does beat out the Pixel 3a, however. You’ll be satisfied with the Moto Z4’s performance, but you can get more for your money.On the software side, Motorola offers a close-to-stock Android 9 Pie interface. It’s simple to use, and the unlocked model doesn’t have any bloatware (the Verizon model I looked at did).Motorola has added a few of its classic features. Moto Actions returns, so you can use gestures like chopping the phone twice to turn on the flashlight or twisting the phone twice to launch the camera app. There’s also Moto Display. Hover your hand close to the screen and you get a quick glance at the time and notifications.Unfortunately, Motorola confirmed to Digital Trends that only one Android version update is planned for the Moto Z4. It will get Android Q, but the jury is out on whether it will receive next year’s Android R. On the plus side, you will receive bi-monthly security updates for two years.The highlight of the Moto Z4 is the camera, because Motorola has packed in a massive 48-megapixel sensor (f/1.7 with optical image stabilization) on the rear as well as a large 25-megapixel sensor (f/2.0) on the front for the selfie camera. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll see large file sizes and ultra-detailed images. The rear and front cameras use Quad Pixel technology — another word for pixel binning.Pixel binning means the camera combines pixels so they take more light. More light means better low-light photographs. This feature is on permanently for the rear camera, so the camera output will always be 12 megapixels. It’s the default option for the selfie camera, so the output is a 6-megapixel photo, but you can opt to use the full 25 megapixels as well (in which case it won’t use pixel binning).Photos taken during the day are detailed, but colors can look a little muted. In fact, photos overall can look a little flat, lacking contrast. The Moto Z4 does a decent job handling high-contrast scenarios with HDR, but this can vary a lot, and I’ve seen it overexpose a fair share of images.To improve low-light photos, there’s a new Night Vision mode. It stacks images together and removes noise for clearer and more colorful nighttime photographs. I was surprised at how well it performed, handling its own compared to the Pixel 3a XL.But Night Vision still isn’t as detailed as the Pixel’s Night Sight images, nor can it match color accuracy and white balance. It does do a better job with noise reduction, and it’s overall is a great addition as you can reliably expect to take decent low-light photos.The biggest issue I have with the camera is that it’s not fast to react. Too often did I miss action shots because the camera shutter was too slow. If you’re not steady, you can also get blurry images frequently in lesser light.Portrait Mode works well in good lighting, but I’m sad to see it only working with people. I tried it on my dog, and it said it couldn’t find a face. The Pixel 3a XL can utilize Portrait Mode on anything, which is a plus. Portrait Mode on the Moto Z4 at night also reveals focusing issues, as too often it focused on the wrong subject.In direct comparisons with the Pixel 3a XL, you can see the Moto Z4 does an admirable job. The Pixel almost always ends up winning though, due to having sharper images.Motorola has added a few A.I. features into the camera. Auto Smile Capture is back, so you can just smile at the selfie camera and it will snap a shot. There’s also Smart Composition, which will recommend the best place to align your photo. Portrait Lighting effects are available for added versatility in that mode, along with the usual Cinemagraph, Spot Color, and Panorama modes.The 25-megapixel selfie camera is decent, though it also has autofocus issues and it struggles with high-contrast scenes.Overall, I’m quite satisfied with the camera capabilities here — just know the Pixel 3a will consistently give you better photos.Motorola has outfitted the Moto Z4 with a large 3,600mAh battery, and it claims the phone should last for two days on a single charge. I have consistently arrived home around 7 p.m. with 40 percent or more remaining in the battery. I have yet to worry about the battery dying on me before I can find a charger — even when I’m out late until close to midnight. If you leave the phone on overnight, the Moto Z4 won’t last long on the second day; Turn it off, and you’ll find it can last at least half the day, depending on usage.The phone fared well in our battery test. I played a 1080p YouTube video with the highest brightness over Wi-Fi, and the Moto Z4 lasted 12 hours and five minutes. That’s better than the Google Pixel 3a XL, and even bests the Samsung Galaxy S10.The Z4 also supports Motorola’s 15-watt Turbopower fast charging solution for rapid recharging, which took the phone from zero to 100 percent in a little more than an hour. There’s no wireless charging, though there’s a Moto Mod you can snap on to get support.The Moto Z4 is available now from Verizon in Flash Grey, but the Frost White color option will arrive later this summer on the carrier. For a limited time, you can buy the Moto Z4 for just $240, or $10 per month for 24 months, on Verizon — but that requires a new activation. If you’re already on Verizon and want to upgrade, you’ll save $100 when you purchase the Moto Z4 via Verizon’s Device Payment Plan.I like the Moto Z4, but it didn’t blow me away in my first day of using it.If you’re eyeing the 5G Moto Mod, Verizon is offering a deal on it also for a limited time, bringing its price down to $200. There’s usually an additional cost to access 5G ($10 a month on top of your Unlimited or Beyond Unlimited plans), but the cost is waived for a limited time. Verizon’s 5G network is only available in Chicago and Minneapolis, and only in small pockets in those two cities. You should wait until 2020 to buy a proper 5G phone, as prices will hopefully come down and coverage will be better.For those looking at the unlocked model, the Moto Z4 is on sale now at $500 from Best Buy, B&H, and Amazon, and a Moto 360 Camera mod comes bundled in. It works on AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Sprint. The unlocked model doesn’t support the 5G Moto Mod at launch but will support it later (you’ll still need to be on Verizon). All versions will come with 128GB of internal storage, and a MicroSD card slot is present if you need more space.Motorola offers a standard limited warranty that protects the phone from manufacturer defects one year from the date of purchase.The Moto Z4 is satisfactory in every way, but it doesn’t excel in anything and it isn’t exciting.Yes. The Pixel 3a at just $400 is one of the best phones to buy if you’re on a budget. It has almost equal performance as the Moto Z4, has a superior camera, good battery life, and it will get timely software updates from Google for 3 years.If you are in the $500 range, the Asus ZenFone 6 is hard to beat. Its camera is not as good as the one on the Pixel 3a, but it has excellent battery life, close to stock Android software, and Asus has a higher chance of supporting its phones for a longer time than Motorola. Best of all is performance, as it’s using the flagship Snapdragon 855 chipset — this phone will be able to tackle all the latest games and apps with ease.Check out our best cheap phones guide for more.The Moto Z4 is a glass sandwich, so you should grab a case to keep it protected. The body of the phone is not IP-rated water resistant. It’s protected from splashes or rain, but it won’t survive full submersion.Software-wise, expect to get Android Q, and not much else. I expect the phone will last around three to four years, though the battery will likely start to depreciate by then.No. For $500, I don’t think the Moto Z4 offers anything substantial over the Google Pixel 3a or the Asus ZenFone 6. It’s a different story if you’re on Verizon or planning to switch to the carrier, as you can get it for a good deal cheaper. If you already have a lot of Moto Mods, the Moto Z4 will serve you well."
61,Nokia 1 Plus,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-3-1-plus-review/,"HMD Global is making a major push into North America this year, and its first smartphone on a U.S. carrier is the Nokia 3.1 Plus on Cricket Wireless. It’s no flashy flagship — costing just $160 — but you wouldn’t be able to tell it cost so little from using it day-to-day. With fantastic battery life and solid performance, it comes close to being great, but the camera holds this budget smartphone back.The Nokia 3.1 Plus looks and feels like it deserves a higher price tag. It shares a resemblance to many other Nokia phones we’ve seen from HMD, with a centrally-placed vertical camera setup as well as a fingerprint sensor on the back. The blue-and-matte look makes it stand out from the sea of black phones.While it looks good, the Nokia 3.1 Plus feels great. Its heft makes it more substantial. The rear is polycarbonate along an aluminum frame, not glass, which means you can worry less about breaking the phone. The phone feels like a brick, and like Nokia phones of old, you could probably toss it across a room without much damage (but don’t try it, please).The edges are rounded, so the phone can sit comfortably in your hand. It’s large, though, so you might find it tough to reach the top of the screen when holding it with one hand, since it has a tall 18:9 aspect ratio. Those in favor of smaller phones may find it too big.The matte back tends to pick up smudges, but they’re easy to wipe away. The polycarbonate shell is removable. A small lip at the bottom, by the USB-C charging port, helps pry it off. It’s only for inserting a MicroSD card or SIM card. You can’t replace the battery. The MicroSD card will come in handy, as this phone only comes with 32GB of internal storage, which can fill up quickly. You’ll also be happy to see a headphone jack along the top of the phone.The Nokia 3.1 Plus looks and feels like it deserves a higher price tag.Chunky bezels surround the 5.99-inch IPS LCD screen. The top bezel has the earpiece, a Nokia logo, and the selfie camera. The bottom bezel, also known as the “chin,” doesn’t house anything. It doesn’t follow the bezel-less trend for phones, but the Nokia 3.1 Plus doesn’t look too dated. The screen has rounded corners to help it look more modern.The screen boasts 1,440 x 720 resolution. It’s easy to see individual pixels if you bring the phone close to your eyes, but they’re tough to spot at a normal viewing distance. Colors look a little muted, and viewing angles aren’t great, so it’s tough to identify what’s on the screen when looking at it in an angle. Our biggest gripe is that the display is a bit dim, so we had trouble seeing it clearly in broad daylight.The best word for the screen is “adequate.” Videos on Netflix and YouTube never look sharp, and colors look washed out. We compared it with the similarly-priced Moto E5 Plus (also on Cricket Wireless) and found the Motorola phone offered better image quality and more realistic colors, which we preferred over the slightly brighter Nokia phone. We wouldn’t want to use the Nokia 3.1 Plus to binge-watch a whole series, but it’s manageable if you must.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has been available in international markets for some time, but the U.S. model is slightly different. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 processor with 2GB RAM instead of the MediaTek chipset in the global edition. The performance should be comparable, and it’s satisfactory.Everything happens more slowly than on a flagship phone, which is understandable. Apps take a few moments to load and transitioning to another takes a little longer. The fingerprint sensor is finicky, and you may see some stutters when scrolling through apps like Instagram and Twitter. But remembering the $160 price tag, we were surprised at how many everyday tasks we could complete on the Nokia 3.1 Plus.Benchmark scores place this phone higher than other phones in a similar price bracket, like the Moto E5 Plus. That makes sense, as it uses a slightly better processor. In terms of gaming, expect to only play games that don’t require much graphical power. We could hardly get through a game of PUBG: Mobile due to slow frame rates. Games like Breakneck and Alto’s Odyssey were playable, but we had to deal with slight stutters during gameplay. Simpler titles should pose no issue, but this is not ideal for heavy mobile gamers.Simple titles should pose no issue, but this phone is not ideal for heavy mobile gamers.This is not the phone to buy if your job heavily relies on your smartphone and you need to perform tasks quickly. The Nokia 3.1 Plus may surprise you with its capability, but it will require just a little patience. We strongly recommend the OnePlus 6T for people looking for strong performance on a budget, though it’s really in a different league of pricing.Another reasonable option is the Moto G7 Play, which is available in the spring. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 600-series processor, and it only costs $40 more than the Nokia 3.1 Plus.Most Nokia phones from HMD Global run Google’s Android One software, which means it’s the pure, unaltered version of Android straight from Google. That means the phones receive fast version and security updates straight from Google, and there’s almost zero bloatware. Unfortunately, to sell its phones in U.S. carrier stores, HMD had to drop the Android One branding — neither the Nokia 2V on Verizon or the Nokia 3.1 Plus are a part of the program.HMD said it plans to work with carrier partners to deliver fast updates to these phones. We can only hold the company to its word. Thankfully, it has a good track record so far — it’s one of the only manufacturers that has delivered Android Pie (the latest version) to many already-released phones. However, you’ll have to deal with bloatware when you first boot up the Nokia 3.1 Plus. Apps like Amazon Shopping, Candy Crush Friends, Candy Crush Saga, Daily Pedometer, Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, Yahoo! Finance, and more come pre-installed on the phone, eating up valuable storage space. Thankfully, you can uninstall almost all of these and never have to worry about them after setting the phone up.As another positive, the Nokia’s 3.1 Plus does run Android 9 Pie, and it just may be one the cheapest phones around with it. The software interface is dead simple to use, and best of all it looks good.HMD says it plans to work with carrier partners to deliver fast updates.One feature we like about this phone is the inclusion of a near-field communication (NFC) sensor. This is often non-existent on budget phones — see Motorola’s latest Moto G7 range, which costs more than the Nokia 3.1 Plus — but the inclusion here means you can use the Nokia phone for contactless payments via Google Pay, or share files and more through Android’s native Beam technology.The Nokia 3.1 has a dual-camera setup on the back. It’s a 13-megapixel lens paired with a second 5-megapixel lens. This combination allows for Live Bokeh photos — known as Portrait Mode on other phones – but that’s the only bonus feature. Optical zoom is MIA, which we didn’t really expect on such a cheap phone.The specs look fine, but the results sadly fall short. We’ve hardly captured a photo that’s sharp in all our time testing the Nokia 3.1 Plus. Even outdoor photos taken in broad daylight, which budget phones like the Moto E5 Plus and the Nokia 6.1 can handle, look fuzzy. Any kind of movement, whether it’s from the subject or your shaky hands, will produce a blurry photo. The camera has trouble focusing in low-light scenarios, so the photos are often unusable.The Live Bokeh feature produces surprisingly accurate blurred effects around subjects, but they’re not any sharper. The 8-megapixel camera on the front can take decent selfies, but it’s no better than the competition.Decent photos occasionally came out of the Nokia 3.1 Plus, but most of the time we opted to avoid using the camera. It’s disappointing, as there’s a lot to like about the phone, and it’s not like there aren’t better cameras in this price range. The Moto E5 Plus can take better photos, and it costs around the same (depending on where you buy it from), but the new Moto G7 Play that costs $200 should be able to beat out the Nokia 3.1 Plus easily.The camera is the biggest weakness of the Nokia 3.1 Plus.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has a 3,500mAh battery, and the company said the phone should last for two days on a single charge.That’s perhaps a little optimistic with mid-to-high smartphone usage, but for the most part it’s an accurate claim. We often ended the work day with around 50 percent remaining on the phone by 6 p.m. That’s with using it to play games like Breakneck, stream music, capture photos, respond to notifications, and browse social media. We didn’t charge the phone and managed to reach 15 percent by 2 p.m. the next day. With lighter use, the Nokia 3.1 Plus can reach two days of use.In our video playback battery test, the Nokia 3.1 Plus lasted a whopping 6 and a half hours running a YouTube video with brightness cranked to the max. It beats out phones like the iPhone 8, which does have a smaller battery. It’s worth noting the Moto E5 Plus (aka the Moto E5 Supra on Cricket Wireless) has a 5,000mAh battery capacity, so it lasts closer to two full days than the Nokia phone, with the potential to hit three days on a single charge.On a Saturday when we didn’t use the phone much, the phone had 75 percent remaining by 10 p.m. — it does a great job of conserving battery life when in standby mode, which helps.But the best part of the phone is that it has a USB-C charging port. Most budget phones in this range — like the Moto E5 Supra — use MicroUSB ports. USB-C is far more versatile, allows for faster charging. It’s a port used in various products now like laptops too, which means people only need to carry one type of charging cable.The Nokia 3.1 Plus is $160, and is exclusively available from Cricket Wireless in the U.S.HMD Global offers a standard one-year warranty for its products sold in the U.S., which covers manufacturer defects and not much else.There are a lot of good phones you can buy under $300, but the under $200 crowd is still small. The Nokia 3.1 Plus is a solid entry. The performance is decent, battery life is great, and HMD promises to update the phone to new Android versions as they come. But the camera sets it back, negating the small wins it earns over the Moto E5 Plus (like NFC for Google Pay and a USB-C port).We bring up the Moto E5 Plus because it’s our favorite phone under $200, but we’d say you should hold off on purchasing either the Nokia 3.1 Plus or the Moto E5 Plus. The Moto G7 Play, which we’ve brought up already, will offer even greater value — particularly in the performance and camera department — and we believe it’s worth waiting for when it arrives in spring.Our favorite phone under $300 at the moment is the 2018 Nokia 6.1, though the newer G7 Power or standard Moto G7 will likely overtake it after our testing. HMD will be unveiling new phones at Mobile World Congress in 2019, so it’s worth waiting until Feb. 24 to find out if there are new entries to its budget categories that could take over our current favorites.If you absolutely want to own a Nokia phone on a budget, you can’t go wrong with the Nokia 7.1. While it does ratchet the price up to $350, it offers fantastic build quality, a capable camera, and a much better display.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has no water resistance rating, so be sure to keep it away from liquids. It does feel like a brick, so it may be able to withstand drops better than other phones, but a case is always worthwhile.Though the phone isn’t part of the Android One program, HMD promises it will work with Cricket Wireless to push out timely version and security updates. We’ll just have to wait to see if the company comes through. We expect it to last two years, at the least.Only if you’re a diehard Nokia fan and don’t want to spend more than $200. You’ll be disappointed by the camera. If you can spend slightly more, wait for the Moto G7 Play, or HMD’s upcoming MWC announcements."
62,Nokia 4.2,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-42-review/,"The Nokia 4.2 has been a roller coaster. My initial review unit suffered from constant stutters and freezes that made using the phone a hair-pulling affair. The second unit has delivered a markedly improved experience, but it doesn’t stop this $189 phone from having several compromises.Affordable phones have to make sacrifices, but the problem rests with the competition. Motorola makes a phone with performance that’s magnitudes better for just $10 more: The Moto G7 Play. It also has the more convenient USB-C port, on top of a decent camera, great battery life, and a near-stock Android experience.HMD’s Nokia 4.2 has a lot going for it. The camera, while slow, is capable in broad daylight. It doesn’t look its price (in a good way), battery life is amazing, and I love the notification LED that circles the power button. It’s also an Android One phone, so it’s guaranteed updates for two years. But it all boils down to performance, and it can be frustrating.The Nokia 4.2 doesn’t resemble a budget phone. The Moto G7 Play, by comparison, looks and feels decidedly cheap. The Nokia 4.2 has a metal unibody with a polycarbonate frame, and the rear is protected by glass. That means it has a higher chance of needing a repair after a drop, but also makes the phone feel more substantial.A quick note on the color. I recommend going for the Pink Sand option over black. It’s much more attractive, and helps the phone stand out.The rear glass is a fingerprint magnet you’ll be wiping down regularly. Speaking of fingerprints, there’s a fingerprint sensor present here. It can be a little slow, which is a consistent theme with the Nokia 4.2.You’re treated to a headphone jack at the top, a Micro USB charging port at the bottom, a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left, and a volume rocker and power button on the right. The lack of a USB-C charging port is disappointing; many other products have USB-C ports, from MacBooks and iPad Pros to Windows laptops and most Android smartphones. It’s ideal to carry just one cable that can charge anything. The $200 Moto G7 Play has one, so why couldn’t HMD add it in here?The Nokia 4.2’s processor cripples the phone.The headphone jack is a welcome inclusion, and you’ll want to use it or use Bluetooth earbuds, because the bottom-firing speakers aren’t loud. The audio quality is decent, though. The buttons around the phone are clicky, and the dedicated Google Assistant button is useful if you use Assistant a lot (you can disable it, but can’t remap the button).My favorite feature is the power button, which glows when you receive notifications. That’s good, because the Nokia 4.2 doesn’t have an Always-on Display when it’s not charging (due to the lack of an OLED screen). It looks great, in the dark. It would’ve been neat to customize the color, but you’re stuck with white.I like how compact the Nokia 4.2 feels. The screen is just 5.71 inches, which may sound large, but because the bezels are slim it packs a lot of screen in a small-ish package. The rounded edges make the phone more comfortable to hold, and the glass is smooth to the touch.The HD+ LCD screen is nothing to write home about. It’s colorful and sharp (1,520 x 720 resolution) if you look at it from a reasonable viewing distance. Look closer, and pixels are visible. It’s a bit dim, making it hard to read the screen in broad daylight, and black levels aren’t as satisfying as an OLED screen.There’s a teardrop notch at the top, which is where the selfie camera sits. The phone still has a “chin,” or bottom bezel, but the front design helps the Nokia 4.2 look more modern (and easily better than the Moto G7 Play).The Nokia 4.2’s processor is what holds it all back. It’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 chipset with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. While 32GB is average for a phone this affordable, you’ll want to use the MicroSD card slot, as with my 101 apps installed (including the preloaded apps), I hit 86 percent of the allotted storage.My initial review unit frustrated me to no end due to the constant hang ups and freezes as I used the phone. This turned out to be a problem with the unit; the second model didn’t have many of these issues.Performance is decent. Expect stutters here and there when scrolling through apps like Twitter and Instagram, but it’s bearable. Games like Pako: Forever and Breakneck ran admirably, with only a few dropped frames here and there. I found myself able to do most of the tasks I’d accomplish with a flagship smartphone, it all just took a little longer.Opening an app takes a a few seconds; so does loading a game, or sharing a picture, or turning the phone on. There were moments when I quickly needed to search for something on Google Maps, and I’d be frustrated at how slow the phone took to give me what I wanted. It’s not the case all the time, but usually when I’m juggling between a few apps.Here are the benchmark results:These scores are below the Moto G7 Play, which has the superior Snapdragon 632 (so does the Moto G7 Power). My colleague didn’t have performance problems with the Moto G7 series when he tested it — everything operated smoothly. Unfortunately, the Nokia 4.2 will inevitably frustrate you at some point.I love HMD’s phones because most run the Android One program. They’re guaranteed at least two years of Android software and security updates. These updates roll out quickly, too, so you hardly need to wait after Google rolls them out. In comparison, Samsung Galaxy S9 owners had to wait six months for the company to bring Android Pie to the phone.The benefit of updates means the phone stays secure, you gain new features, and bugs and issues have a higher chance of being patched. This is where HMD has Motorola beat. Motorola hardly offers a year of Android updates for its phones — the Moto G7 Play will only get Android Q, and not much more.Android One doesn’t just mean fast updates, though. You receive stock Android, which is uncluttered, simple, and easy to use. There’s no bloatware, aside from preloaded Google apps. There’s even NFC on board, so you can use Google Pay (another plus over the Moto G7 Play).While the software is a positive experience on the Nokia 4.2, I did encounter a bug. If the phone’s left alone and on standby, it can sometimes disconnect from Wi-Fi. Turning the screen back on reconnects it, but it’s an issue I haven’t been able to resolve. We’ve also noticed this bug on the Moto G7 series, so there’s a chance it’s Android-related and not device specific.The Nokia 4.2 has a dual-camera system on the rear — one 13-megapixel lens paired with a 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. The camera can be slow to launch, and the shutter can also take its time. Because of this, you need to be still when trying to take a photo to avoid a blurry result.But in good lighting, the Nokia 4.2 can be capable. It does a decent job of dealing with high-contrast scenarios with HDR, details are solid, and colors look natural. Case in point? The picture of the Vessel in New York City, as well as the photo of my dog lying on my bed. They’re impressive for a $189 phone.As usual, it’s in low-light environments that the camera starts to degrade in quality. Images are grainy. While I had to stay still before, in low-light you need to be as still as a statue.. I saw better results using the Pro mode in the camera at night, but not everyone will understand how to use manual controls.Portrait Mode works well in good lighting conditions, but any dip in light, including use indoors, can make images look poor. It has trouble focusing in these situations, and photos never look quite sharp. HDR never seems to work as well in Portrait Mode, too.			The 8-megapixel camera on the front works decently, though it has a problem with high-contrast scenarios. In the selfie image of me, the sky is completely blown out. The Portrait Mode selfie photo is better, as the exposure is accurate with no blown-out areas, and there’s a nice bokeh effect.It’s a capable camera that takes a negative turn in low light, like all budget phones. You do have to work with the camera to stay extremely still, though, which is annoying. It’s comparable to the Moto G7 Play, though I think the Nokia 4.2 fares a little better in quality.Finally, we get to the best part of the Nokia 4.2. Never in my time reviewing the phone did I worry about it dying on me. The 3,000mAh battery isn’t large, but with low power specifications and a low-resolution screen, it’s enough to keep the phone whirring for more than a day.With hard use, the phone will hit around 20 or 30 percent by midnight. With light to average use, it will still have juice for a second day, though it might require a recharge by noon.While I was happy with the battery in real-world testing, the Nokia 4.2 did not fare as well in our battery test. I played a 1080p YouTube video with the screen brightness at max on Wi-Fi, and the Nokia 4.2 only survived for 7 hours and 38 minutes. It’s a decent time, but the Moto G7 Play lasted more than 9 hours, and the $250 Moto G7 Power stayed alive for nearly 14 hours.Battery test aside, most people will be more than satisfied with what the Nokia 4.2 can offer here. It’s just a shame it needs a Micro USB cable to charge.The Nokia 4.2 is $189 and available from Amazon and Best Buy. It only works on GSM networks, so you can use it on carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket Wireless, and Metro by T-Mobile. It won’t work on CDMA networks like Verizon or Sprint.HMD offers a standard one-year warranty that covers the phone from manufacturing defects one year since the purchase date.The Nokia 4.2’s good looks, great battery life, decent camera, and speedy Android updates are held back by a weak processor. It’s capable, but there are better alternatives.Yes, the Moto G7 Play. It shares many of the same specifications as the Nokia 4.2, from the 3,000mAh battery to 3GB of RAM, but the processor is what pulls it ahead. The Snapdragon 632 is much more capable and won’t frustrate you. That’s why I think the G7 Play is the better buy for just $11 more at $200.It does come down to whether you want to choose longer software support over performance, as these Motorola phones will only deliver one Android version update (Android Q), whereas the Nokia 4.2 will get Android R next year as well. While we typically give praise to phones that promise software updates for two or more years, I think the significant boost in processor power gives the Moto G7 Play the edge.If you spend $250, you can buy the Moto G7 Power, which has a bigger screen — but you get the same performance as the Moto G7 Play. Better yet, the 5,000mAh battery means it’s a two-day phone.If you want to stick with the Nokia brand, it’s worth shelling out $300 for the Nokia 7.1. It has good performance, the same Android One software, and a capable camera. If your budget goes up a bit more, then the Google Pixel 3a should be on your list, because it’s all the phone you need at just $400.For more, check out our guide to the best cheap phones.The Nokia 4.2 is sandwiched in glass, so you should get a case to make sure it doesn’t crack from a drop. It’s also not water resistant.On the plus side, the phone will receive two years of Android version and security updates, so it should last two years at the minimum. That’s if the performance doesn’t take a turn for the worse by then.No. A 600-series Qualcomm processor inside the Nokia 4.2 would have changed the story, but the Snapdragon 439 doesn’t cut it when you can buy a phone with better performance for just $11 more."
63,Nokia 7.2,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-7-2-review/,"Google’s Pixel 3a flipped the table on budget smartphones. It brought a fantastic camera experience down to an affordable $400 price point. It also receives version and security updates straight from Google, a feature that’s lacking even on flagship phones. These are the features HMD Global wants to emulate with its latest Nokia 7.2.Yet it doesn’t quite get there. The Nokia 7.2’s performance is not as good as the Pixel 3a’s. Battery life is adequate, but not as good as the Pixel 3a’s. The camera experience is solid, but the Pixel 3a goes above and beyond.See a theme?At $350, it’s cheaper than its prime target’s original $400 price, except you can find the Pixel 3a for $300 already. If the Pixel 3a didn’t exist, I’d heartily recommend the Nokia 7.2. Yet it does, and HMD can’t keep up.The Nokia 7.2 is among the most stylish phones you can buy in its price range. The corners are rounded, and the circular camera module in the center looks nicer than the vertical camera system on its predecessor, though it owes inspiration to Motorola phones.There’s a beautiful effect that plays upon the rear glass when it catches the light, especially on the Cyan Green color, where the Nokia 7.2 looks more sophisticated. It also comes in Ice and Charcoal, but Cyan Green is the one I’d pick.It’s protected by Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and the back. HMD says it’s using a polymer composite around the frame that’s double the strength of polycarbonate, but lighter. That means the Nokia 7.2 is more durable than the average mid-range phone, but the most important parts of the phone are still made of glass, so you’ll want to use a case. Thankfully, the glass has a matte texture on the back, which keeps it free of fingerprints and smudges. It’s a shame there’s no IP68 water resistance to cover all the bases, but it’s splash-proof, so it should be fine in the rain.Build quality is HMD’s strength, and it continues to deliver phones that feel like they deserve a higher price tag. I can’t say the same for Google’s Pixel 3a, which admittedly feels low-rent.Despite its 6.3-inch screen size, the Nokia 7.2 is usable with one hand (though I do have large hands). The fingerprint sensor is easy to reach, the rounded edges are smooth to the touch, and help the phone fit ergonomically into my palm.There’s a beautiful effect that plays upon the rear glass when it catches the light, especially on the Cyan Green color.There’s a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left side if you want to call it up quickly, and the power button on the right edge doubles as an LED notification light for those who want a visual cue when alerts come in. It’s a feature we’ve seen before on the Nokia 4.2 earlier this year. It’s helpful when this side of the phone is facing me, but I’d prefer an always-on display, which is not available.The buttons are clicky and feel nice to press, but I can’t say the same for the haptic feedback; the vibrations don’t feel pleasant. Making it up is the existence of a headphone jack, which I’m sure a lot of people will be happy to see.The 6.3-inch screen looks modern, thanks to the slimmed-down bezels, and the teardrop notch where the selfie camera rests is a whole lot more elegant than the wide notch on the Nokia 7.1 from last year. It’s still an LCD panel, so blacks don’t look deep, but it uses HMD’s PureDisplay technology, so SDR content is up-scaled into HDR (it supports the HDR10 standard on select apps).That means richer colors and higher contrast, and the screen certainly delivers. Shows like Disenchantment on Netflix look excellent, even outdoors, and episodes of Hot Ones on YouTube produce natural colors. There’s solid detail, too, thanks to the 2,280 x 1,080 resolution.I had no trouble using the phone outdoors in bright sunlight, though I did have to crank the brightness to the max of 500 nits.Ultimately, there never was a time that I thought the Nokia 7.2’s camera beat the single 12-megapixel camera on the Pixel 3a.On the audio side, the phone can get loud and the quality is surprisingly strong, with clear highs and mids, but the bass is incredibly weak. It’s great for listening to movies and videos, but you’ll want to plug in for music or connect to a Bluetooth speaker.48-megapixel cameras are becoming more and more commonplace with phones like the Motorola One Vision and the OnePlus 7 Pro utilizing them. Whether they’re needed on smartphones is debatable, as more megapixels don’t necessarily translate to a better camera, and that’s best exemplified on the Nokia 7.2. By default, the camera takes 12-megapixel photos as it uses a process called pixel binning to merge pixels together, so they can take in more light. It should mean the camera can take nice low-light photos, but that’s not the result I found.It can take adequate photos during the day, with decent detail, though colors can look a bit muted at times. Problems start to creep in as the day goes on. The phone can take solid low-light photos, but it’s not consistent. You need to stay as still as possible because there’s no optical image stabilization. Any movement will result in a blurry photo. It doesn’t help that the phone isn’t the fastest to snap photos.Use the dedicated Night mode, and the problem is exacerbated. If you’re not using a tripod, these photos can look blurrier most of the time, though colors are improved. One perk is the dedicated Pro mode, so if you know how to change the shutter speed and ISO, you can snap some better photos than the auto mode. Ultimately, there was never a time that I thought the Nokia 7.2’s camera beat the single 12-megapixel camera on the Pixel 3a.Below are a few comparisons with the Pixel 3a, and you can see how much more Google’s phone retains detail and more appealing colors. For more comparisons, check out the video above.There’s also an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens on the back of the Nokia 7.2, and it helps you take in more of a scene. I frequently didn’t want to use this lens because the images don’t look great even at high noon. Detail can look blotchy, skies are often blown out due to poor HDR (or lack thereof), and colors are done. Good luck trying to get a usable photo in low-light too — the Night mode doesn’t fare well here either.Here are some examples next to the iPhone 11 as reference (yes, I know the iPhone 11 is $350 more).A 5-megapixel depth sensor is employed on the rear for a new feature in the camera’s Portrait mode called Zeiss Bokeh Styles. It borrows from the rich history of Zeiss lenses to mimic bokeh — or blur — styles and applies them behind a subject. You can choose from Zeiss Swirl, Zeiss Smooth, and Zeiss Modern, along with other options.The effect is aggressive. If you like the style it’s going for, you’ll have fun here, but I recommend bringing down the blur effect all the way down to a level 2 or 3 instead of the default 5. When it works, you can snap some great portraits.The Nokia 7.2 doesn’t do a great job of accurately outlining a subject in a portrait. It makes mistakes more than other phones like the Pixel 3a, and when that’s paired with the aggressive portrait effect, it looks heavily processed.Below, the Pixel 3a’s shot looks so natural, as though the photo was shot on a DSLR. The bokeh effect is solid, detail and colors are strong, and there aren’t any mistakes. The Nokia 7.2’s portrait, taken with the 20-megapixel selfie camera, completely messes up the table, weirdly blurring it out. Elements of the photo are overexposed and the colors aren’t quite right, though detail is solid.If your background isn’t too busy and there’s strong lighting, you can take nice portraits with either the front or rear cameras. But if conditions aren’t optimal, the photos don’t look great.The Nokia 7.2 can snap photos I’ll happily share, and if you asked me a year ago, I’d say it’s a great camera system. But Google has changed the game with the Pixel 3a and its excellent camera experience, and Nokia’s attempt now feels outdated.Now we come to the Nokia 7.2’s Achilles’ heel: performance. I had a strange experience with this phone. I went through three units because the first two drove me up the wall with constant freezes and hang-ups. The performance was so frustrating on those initial models that I frequently found myself swearing, uh, quite audibly. That’s never a good sign.After talking back and forth with HMD — I even sent video proof that my 7.2 was acting wonky —  the company sent me a third unit. I suppose the third time’s the charm, as it finally worked.Even then, it wasn’t perfect. There’s a Snapdragon 660 processor inside with 4GB of RAM, a step up from the Snapdragon 636 inside last year’s Nokia 7.1. While it can perform most day-to-day tasks without too much of a struggle, it does stutter here and there and also freezes occasionally (particularly when switching apps). Don’t expect apps to launch at rocket speed or games to load up and run well, either. Alto’s Odyssey and Pako: Forever were playable, but I did notice a few skipped frames.Here are a few benchmark results:These scores are a little higher than the results from the Pixel 3a, which uses the better Snapdragon 670 and scored 159,554 on AnTuTu. Yet overall, I had a better experience with Google’s phone. Performance is smoother with fewer stutters, and I had no trouble playing games like PUBG: Mobile, though on lower graphical settings.If you’re not a power user, you only use a handful of apps, and you don’t play demanding games, the Nokia 7.2 will be sufficient. HMD’s phone does step up its storage game over the Pixel, though, offering 128GB base internal storage and support for a MicroSD card if you need more.As is the case with most HMD Nokia phones, the Nokia 7.2 is a part of the Android One program. That means you get a promise of three years of security updates and two operating system upgrades. While it’s running Android 9 Pie at the moment, it will get Android 10 soon.This is a big deal because there’s a dearth of budget and mid-range smartphones that offer this level of software support. Fast updates mean new features — like Android 10’s dark theme — and it also keeps your phone secure thanks to bug patches. Motorola, one of HMD’s main competitors in the U.S., is only offering one year of version upgrades for its mid-range phones with “industry-related security updates,” which means whenever there’s a big security issue. Phones like the Moto E6 aren’t getting a single OS upgrade. It’s quite remarkable what HMD is doing.The interface is utilizing stock Android, so it’s clean, slick, simple to use, and there’s no bloatware (unless you count Google apps as bloat). The main changes are in the camera app, where HMD has added its own features.There’s a dearth of budget and mid-range smartphones that offer this level of software support.All that said, Google’s Pixel 3a is a rung up the ladder as it will get updates even faster for the same length of time. It already has Android 10, for example.The Nokia 7.2 will get you through a full workday with medium use and a full day with light use with its 3,500mAh battery. I often arrived home around 6 p.m. with 30% remaining. Battery anxiety starts to creep in whenever I decided to extend my night out, though — around 9:30 p.m. it hit 15%.It fared poorly in a standard video playback test, where we play a 1080p YouTube video at full brightness over Wi-Fi. It lasted 5 hours and 2 minutes, well behind competitors like the Pixel 3a, which lasted 9 hours and 12 minutes. This test isn’t a good indicator of real-world usage, but the Pixel 3a will easily last you a full day with medium use.There’s a USB-C charging port, and it charges up quick enough, hitting 100% around the hour and a half mark. There’s sadly no wireless charging, but most phones in this price range don’t have it.The Nokia 7.2 is $350 and is available from Amazon and Best Buy. Do note that the phone only works on GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile.HMD Global offers a standard limited warranty, which protects the phone from manufacturing defects one year since the date of purchase.The Nokia 7.2 great build quality with a nice design, a strong screen experience, along with decent performance and battery life. Its camera system is solid, but it doesn’t hold up to competitors like Google’s Pixel 3a.Yes. The Google Pixel 3a. It’s an improvement in almost every way, with better performance, longer battery life, a nicer AMOLED screen, and a stunning camera. It can also be found for less than its original $400 price tag, even cheaper than the Nokia 7.2.Check out our best cheap phones guide for more.The Nokia 7.2 will last two to three years before its performance might start to suffer and the battery life begins to degrade. Thankfully, the software experience will still be up-to-date as it runs Android One and will continue to get updates until 2022.No. It’s difficult to recommend the Nokia 7.2 when the Pixel 3a is simply better in every way, especially when it can be found for less."
64,Nokia 9 PureView,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-9-pureview-review/,"I’m on vacation in Lisbon, Portugal, and I have several phones at my disposal — the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Google Pixel 3 XL, Apple iPhone XS Max, and Nokia 9 PureView. I’ve spent enough time with each phone to know what I do and don’t like, and while this may be because it’s the newest phone in my hands, I’m consistently drawn to using the Nokia 9 to capture my time here. That’s not to say it’s the best phone of the lot — neither is it the best camera phone — but there’s a sense of excitement when I use the five-camera system that I haven’t felt on any other smartphone in a long time.But the Nokia 9 has its drawbacks. The phone, made by HMD Global, has an in-display fingerprint reader that’s finicky; the battery life could be better; and image processing is a bit slow (though there’s some benefit to this that I’ll explain later). It’s not the best choice for most people at its its $699 retail price. There are also reports of multiple bugs on several units, particularly where apps start to crash after the phone goes below 50 percent — we haven’t run into too many of these problems on our review unit, but we’ve reached out to HMD asking about a timeline for when people can expect the bugs to be fixed.Keep in mind, this is a limited-edition phone, so there’s only so many that will be available — it’s already back ordered until April. That makes the phone feel a little more exclusive when it’s in your hands. Most people looking for a phone in this category should look at the Pixel 3, iPhone XR, Galaxy S10e, or OnePlus 6T instead, but I think the Nokia 9 PureView is worth buying specifically if you’re a photography enthusiast.There’s nothing fancy about the Nokia 9 from the front. The screen is quite traditional by 2019’s standards: There’s no hole-punch camera floating somewhere on the screen, and you won’t even find a notch. This may appeal to quite a few people that abhor these new screen styles.Instead, there are bezels on the top and the bottom, but they’re thin and the phone still looks smart. More impressive is the build quality — a 6000-series aluminum unibody is paired with Gorilla Glass 5, which helps make the Nokia 9 more sturdy. The edges are slightly rounded, but they’re easy to grip, and the phone never once felt unwieldy. It is slippery, though, so you should be careful with where you place it as it may easily slide off and hit the floor. (Maybe get a case?)The power and volume buttons are close to each other and are easily accessible. They are satisfying to press, though a textured power button would have been a nice touch to distinguish them. You’ll be disappointed if you’re looking for a 3.5mm headphone jack, as there’s none here, but a USB-C port sits at the bottom.No camera bump here, the Nokia 9 will sit flat on your desk.The display is a 5.99-inch POLED screen with a sharp 2,880 × 1,440 resolution. It’s not jaw-dropping like the high-resolution Dynamic AMOLED screen on the Galaxy S10, but I never found the screen lacking. In fact, I’ve consistently been impressed with the screen’s brightness, as I’ve been able to read it without fail in direct, bright sunlight. The screen is a little over-saturated though — as you can see above — but if this bothers you there’s a “Basic” display setting that tones colors down.The Nokia 9 supports HDR10. Movies and videos have good contrast and are a pleasure to watch, thanks to a higher dynamic range. But I’m not a fan of the phone’s mono bottom-firing speakers, as they’re easy to block while watching content in portrait orientation. They get loud and sound decent (though bass is lacking), but HMD should have followed Google’s lead with stereo front-facing speakers, like on the Pixel 3 — especially considering there’s space for them on the bezels.It’s the back that’s the highlight here. The five-camera setup is laid out in a way that mimics spider’s eyes, which may make some people shudder — and it also may irk people with trypophobia, a fear of clustered holes. None of that describes me, and I can’t stop admiring its beauty. It looks so unlike any existing camera setup that it will make everyone do a double take, but it’s the fact that the cameras sit flush on the back that makes it even more impressive; no camera bump here, the Nokia 9 will lie flat on your desk. It’s just a cleaner design that’s worth appreciating. (More on the camera later.)Notice that the fingerprint sensor is missing? The Nokia 9 joins a growing wave of phones that are opting for in-display fingerprint sensors, like the Galaxy S10, the OnePlus 6T, and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. But everyone’s using different technology — so far, I’m quite happy with the ultrasonic tech Samsung is using in its newest phones. The sensor on the Nokia 9? Not so much.You need to press hard onto the screen for it to register, but even when you do, it’s finicky about when it wants to identify the print. I’ve reset my fingerprint multiple times — even added multiple profiles of the same fingerprint to see if it would improve — and still it’s hit or miss when the phone wants to unlock. I’ve resorted to just using a pattern unlock and the un-secure Face Unlock option, which works relatively well, but you can’t use this to access secure apps or authenticate purchases.The Nokia 9 PureView only comes in a blue color option, which makes it look opulent, though I’d have loved to see more options to choose from.The Nokia 9 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 chipset, the processor that was used in almost every flagship smartphone in 2018. Some of you may be a little annoyed by this, especially considering there are quite a few Android phones announced with the latest Snapdragon 855 processor.Is the Snapdragon 845 a bad processor? Hardly. I didn’t run into issues with performance — the 6GB of RAM helps too — but it’s easy to feel miffed about buying a new phone that uses last year’s tech. Well, if you can get past it, you don’t have much to worry here; the Nokia 9 PureView tackled games like Alto’s Odyssey, Pako 2, and Breakneck without fail. Day-to-day tasks and split-screen apps posed no problem either. Performance is good. Period.Here are a few benchmark options:These scores are in line with other phones that use the Snapdragon 845. The Nokia 9 comes a little lower than the Pixel 3 and the OnePlus 6T in AnTuTu, but benchmark scores don’t tell the full picture. Expect the same performance, and you likely will never feel as though the phone can’t accomplish a particular task due to its chip.There’s a reason for the lack of a Snapdragon 855 — the phone has been in development for quite some time, and HMD has been working closely with Qualcomm to ensure the 845 processor could support the five-camera array. The 855 chip is simply too new, and opting to use it would have only further delayed the Nokia 9.Thankfully, the Nokia 9 comes with 128GB of internal storage, which is the base storage option you’ll find on newer phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10 range. There’s no MicroSD card, which is sad to see considering the photo file sizes are quite large.You should know, the Snapdragon 845 chipset inside the Nokia 9 is unlike any other; it’s part of a complex multi-chipset architecture that’s designed for the five cameras. There’s a special Lux Capacitor chipset that helps the phone harness the full power of the Snapdragon 845 for the camera experience. Five cameras mean a lot of data is being captured, and so an Image Signal Processor (ISP) needs help computing it (there’s 240 megapixels of data to deal with, after all). Tapping into the Digital Signal Processor (DSP) delivers three times noise reduction, at 10 times lower power, and the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) manages the 1,200-layer depth map that’s captured.It’s not just a close partnership with Qualcomm that made this work, though. HMD worked with Zeiss to ensure the cameras were tuned precisely, and the multi-camera technology (including the Lux Capacitor) largely comes in collaboration with Light. For those unaware, Light is a company that made the L16, a 16-camera device that promises DSLR-like image quality in a much more portable form factor. HMD and Light said transitioning the tech to a smartphone instead will offer “next-generation imaging for photography enthusiasts.”Why? Because most phones with multiple cameras have clear, identified roles that do not let you use them all at once. Instead, it’s usually a standard lens paired with a telephoto lens for 2x optical zoom, or an ultra-wide-angle lens for a wider shot. On the Nokia 9, you’re getting five 12-megapixel lenses with a f/1.8 aperture each. Tap the shutter button once, and all five cameras snap a photo — sometimes more depending on the conditions you’re in — and fuse them together for a much more detailed image.This fusion process can take some time — around 10 to 20 seconds — which can be a deal breaker (though you do get to see a preview of the photo you just took as it stacks all the photos together). This processing time needs to be shortened, and it could through software updates later on, but I’ve also enjoyed it in a rather odd way. It made me forget about checking on my photos constantly, and instead I took the time to snap more pictures. The delay also led me to check my collective photographs at a later point, analyze them all, choose one, and edit it to post to social media, rather than the more carefree method I’ve usually followed with smartphones of just sharing a photo immediately as I snapped it. Using the Nokia 9 felt more akin to the approach I have using a DSLR.Three of the cameras are monochromatic sensors, while the other two are RGB. This is because monochromatic sensors can capture 2.9-times more light than RGB cameras, so the Nokia 9 has the potential to deliver up to 10-times more light. There’s also a fantastic monochrome camera mode (that uses the three sensors) for beautiful, true black-and-white images if that’s a style you want to pursue.So, what are standard photos like? The one word that comes to mind is natural. These photos are often some of the most true-to-life photos I’ve seen come from a smartphone, and that means hardly anything is oversaturated, contrast doesn’t look over-the-top, and there’s strong detail. The camera app isn’t the fastest to launch — it takes about 1.8 to 2.2 seconds — and the shutter doesn’t offer zero shutter lag (but it’s close) so that does mean trying to take a quick action shot may end up with something a little blurry.Low-light photographs look good too, but detail tends to not be as rich as photos taken in good lighting. We’ve seen better from the likes of the Pixel 3 (particularly with Night Sight). There’s no optical image stabilization, so you need to be very still to ensure photos aren’t blurry at night. But the Nokia 9 almost always captures the right ambiance, compared to other phones. Looking back at the photographs, it evokes the same mood I felt when I was in the environment, and it still maintains that natural look.The photos from the camera come in both JPEG and RAW format (this needs to be turned on in the camera settings). You can take a RAW image — which is uncompressed and contains more information than JPEG — to the Adobe Lightroom Android app and tweak to perfection (or, rather, what you deem to be perfection). It offers far more control over your photographs, which is a big reason why it’s a lot of fun using the Nokia 9 PureView. You’re very much a part of the process, which is not necessarily something I’ve felt using other smartphone cameras. Because the five cameras capture so much more data, it’s impressive what you can do with the RAW images on this phone, which is far more than what you can do with RAW images from other devices like the iPhone and Pixel 3. The example below compares an edit of the RAW file compared to the JPEG from the Nokia 9.I wasn’t able to bring out details in the person’s face in the JPEG file, but it was easy to do in the RAW. This can be done to any photo you capture, though it definitely has a learning curve if you’ve never edited photos. It’s why this phone is marketed toward photography enthusiasts more so than the average person who simply wants to tap the shutter button and send the image to social media. (Even if you aren’t a savvy photo editor, you can still shoot RAW and use Adobe Lightroom’s auto function to do the work for you.)Adobe will also be issuing an update to the Android Lightroom app so it will support all five lens profiles on the Nokia 9, for better image quality and robust control.One of my favorite features in the Nokia 9 is Depth Map, which needs to be switched on. The five cameras can capture more than 1,200 layers of depth data in photos (except in Monochrome mode), so in Google Photos, you can completely refocus a photo, while also adjusting the intensity of the background or foreground blur. You can completely change how the photo looks, and it’s impressive to see how well the cameras identify the levels of depth in images. The blur effect looks good, and while there are errors occasionally, I think the Nokia 9 is one of the best smartphone cameras at the moment to capture photos with strong bokeh. The downside is that Depth Control is only available for JPEG files (doesn’t work with Monochrome mode either), which may not be the file type you want to use most of the time if you prefer having more editing controls.The front 20-megapixel camera can produce detailed images, though its HDR capabilities aren’t as strong so it’s not unusual to see overblown highlights in the background in sunny conditions.There are a few camera features like Pro Mode, which lets you take 10-second long exposure photos to illuminate night scenes; Bothie mode allows you to use both the front and rear camera at the same time; and Live Bokeh is akin to Portrait Mode, and it works similarly to Depth Map.We’ve gone into a similar level of detail with photo examples in this story if you want more, but it’s safe to say that I haven’t had as much fun with a camera in a long time. The Nokia 9 makes me feel like I’m in control of my photographs again, and its varied set of abilities make me think more creatively about the photo I want to capture. It’s not the best smartphone camera for most people — that’s the Pixel 3 — but I think this is the best smartphone camera for photography enthusiasts that are patient enough to tinker and make use of all the capabilities on the Nokia 9.There’s nothing to worry about the phone’s software, as it’s an Android One smartphone, meaning it runs a clean and uncluttered version of Android (also known as stock Android), with no bloatware. The bigger selling point is the promise of fast software updates — the phone will get two years of version updates and three years of security updates. It’s already running the latest Android 9 Pie version, and HMD has a good track record of maintaining a fast pace of updates for its phones.There are virtually no other software features on the phone, which is a part of the allure of Android One. This barebones approach helps make the interface dead simple to use, while still looking good.A 3,320mAh battery is packed into the phone, which means the Nokia 9 will last just about a day — no more, no less. We frequently hit 25 percent by 6 p.m. after a day of medium-to-heavy use.If you’re a heavy user, there’s a good chance you may need to plug it into a charger to make sure it will last. It’s a good idea to use a battery pack if you plan on using the camera a lot as well. I wish the Nokia 9 had a bigger battery, as it’s one of the weaker aspects of the phone, delivering around three hours of screen-on time.The phone performed well in our video playback battery test, though. It lasted for 9 hours and 26 minutes, coming close to the Galaxy S10 Plus’ score of 12 hours and 40 minutes. It goes to show that it’s likely the camera that drains the battery the fastest.There’s Qi support, so if you’re in an office, for example, you can place it on a wireless charging pad throughout the day to keep it topped up.The Nokia 9 PureView costs $699 and goes on sale in the U.S. starting March 4 — here’s how and where to buy it. It’s a limited-edition phone, so at a certain point when HMD’s stock runs out, it won’t be on sale anymore — it’s just unclear what the threshold is as the phone is already backordered until April. You can order it from Amazon, Best Buy, or B&H.HMD Global offers a standard limited warranty that covers manufacturer defects for 12 months since the date of purchase.If you don’t care much for the camera on a phone, or you want a camera to quickly capture good pictures, the Nokia 9 PureView is not for you. It can capture great photos without needing to fuss about with the RAW files, but the phone’s true potential is unlocked when you embrace all its features. It’s an extremely fun camera to use, with a strong display, great performance, and clean Android software. Battery life is a little disappointing, and I wish the fingerprint sensor was better.Yes, many. If you prize performance and software customization, the OnePlus 6T is a good bet (though we could see a OnePlus 7 soon), especially as it costs $550. The Google Pixel 3 is our choice for those who want great software and a great camera that will reliably snap a good photo without needing to do much else, and it will set you back $799, though it can be bought for less now. The Samsung Galaxy S10e is worth a look with its $750 price tag, and if you’re on iOS, the iPhone XR is a great choice for the same price.But perhaps only Huawei’s Leica-tuned P20 Pro — or upcoming P30 Pro — may be the few options that can challenge the Nokia 9 PureView with sheer enjoyment as soon as you tap the shutter button.The body of the phone is IP67 water resistant, which is the standard for all flagship phones, and that means the Nokia 9 can stay alive when submerged up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. The phone is quite slippery, so a case is necessary to protect the glass on both sides.This is an Android One phone, so you’ll get two years of Android version updates, and three years of security updates. They’ll come fairly quickly too.No. It’s a good phone, but the only people that should really buy this phone are those that love tinkering with photos and enjoy exploring all the different camera features in a phone. If that’s you, then you’ll fall in love with the Nokia 9. Get it before it’s sold out."
65,OnePlus 7,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-7-pro-review/,"Is it really possible to have a multi-phone winning streak? Can a manufacturer keep making phones that are easy to recommend over several years without a misstep? If you’re OnePlus, then yes, it is. I’m beginning to assume it has made a deal with a very powerful entity somewhere to ensure its continued success.The OnePlus 7 Pro may cost more than any other OnePlus phone before it, but no matter if you class it as a mid-range or a premium device, it still manages to blow the competition away. If you want the 12GB RAM model, which comes with 256GB of internal storage, OnePlus will relieve you of $750. That’s a lot more than the $580 OnePlus 6T — but make no mistake, you’re getting a lot of impressive tech for this price.But at the same time, as the cost creeps ever higher, there are missing features I’m less willing to forgive. None are deal-breakers, but it’s a cutthroat world out there, and the competition has never been tougher.Unless you’re allergic to phones that look absolutely fantastic, you’ll love the OnePlus 7 Pro’s style. It’s around the front that OnePlus scores the biggest points. Just look at the bezels around that enormous 6.67-inch AMOLED screen. Or rather, don’t. Because they’re almost not there, and neither is a notch.Not since the Oppo Find X have I gasped over such a wonderful expanse of screen so unencumbered by ugly bezels. It’s glorious in every way — gigantic to the point of overkill, bright like a star going supernova, and smoother than a freshly-waxed seal.This slippery smoothness comes from a 90Hz refresh rate for low latency and greater response. Does it work? Yes, it does, and once you’ve used the OnePlus 7 Pro for a few weeks you won’t want to look at another type of screen again.It’s not the first time we’ve seen this technology. The Asus ROG Phone shares a 90Hz refresh rate screen, while the Razer Phone 2 and ROG Phone 2 both have 120Hz refresh rate. Because OxygenOS supports the high refresh rate, everything from the menus to standard apps feel buttery smooth and very responsive as you scroll. There are games that support the 90Hz refresh rate, and I didn’t notice annoying stutters when scrolling quickly though Twitter and Chrome, so it works well.Play 1440p content like this Iz*one music video, and you instantly see how fantastic the screen looks. It’s AMOLED too, thanks to a collaboration with Samsung, so the black levels and overall contrast is spectacular. The massive 3,140 x 1,440 screen resolution means there’s more detail available than most content will offer up anyway. There’s even HDR10+, for more accurate colors on supported platforms. One thing I have noticed is that during calls, the screen will sometimes activate, resulting several times in me activating airplane mode with my cheek, this disconnecting the call. Annoying.Unless you’re allergic to phones that look absolutely fantastic, you’ll love the OnePlus 7 Pro’s style.Do you get the message? Looking at the OnePlus 7 Pro’s screen is more captivating than staring into the eyes of an angel, but what about the body it’s wrapped up in? More than ever, the OnePlus 7 Pro’s design and style can be traced back to Oppo and Vivo, its compatriots in the BBK Electronics family. The deep, matte-finish Gorilla Glass 5 panel on the back is part OnePlus 6T and part RX17 Pro. It looks great, but it’s relatively ordinary. The centrally-mounted camera lens hump sits above the OnePlus logo, and that’s about it for singling it out as a OnePlus phone.It’s quite thick and heavy too. The 7 Pro weighs 206 grams, and it’s really noticeable, especially coming from lighter flagships like the Huawei P30 Pro and the Pixel 3 XL. Put it in a case, and it gets worse; an already sizeable 8.8mm thick chassis gets bigger.It’s nicely weighted though, and given the size of the phone and the technology inside, the weight is to be expected. The shape is reminiscent of the Galaxy S9 Plus and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. There is a noticeable taper around the sides, although OnePlus said the screen has a different level of curvature at the edges than the S10, despite it being a Samsung panel.All the visual action is around the front of the OnePlus 7 Pro, and I can’t stop staring.How did OnePlus get away without a notch, and where is the selfie camera? Again, drawing on experience from Oppo and Vivo, the OnePlus 7 Pro has a pop-up 16-megapixel selfie camera hidden in the top. All sorts of speed, durability, and usability worries come with this type of tech, but OnePlus has worked hard to solve them. It takes a Viagra-charged 0.53 seconds to rise from the body, standing to attention so quickly that it’s genuinely usable for face unlock duties.Once up and about, the selfies it takes are good too. It offers natural skin tones, and an effective portrait mode, where edge detection sometimes even gets the frames of my glasses right.OnePlus has put the pop-up camera through 300,000 cycle tests, which it says will see it happily last for 5 years even if you use it 150 times a day. There’s a cool fall detection mode too, where the camera retracts in less than a second when the gyroscope notices a drop. Push the camera into the body and the system tells you off, but the module itself feels secure and doesn’t wobble about much when prodded. It’s an excellent implementation of the technology needed to ensure a notch-free screen.On the back is OnePlus’ first triple-lens camera. At the top of the array is a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 117-degree field of view, followed by a seven-element, 48-megapixel lens with optical and electronic image stabilization (OIS and EIS), and finally there’s an 8-megapixel telephoto lens also with OIS for a 3x optical zoom or a 10x digital zoom. There are two tiny sensors nestled between the bottom lenses, providing phase detection and contrast focus.OnePlus cameras have always been a little hit-or-miss, and the 7 Pro is no exception, although consistent software updates since launch have improved it. Problems with focusing using the 3x zoom and exposure issues have been cured, and the Night Scape mode has also been tweaked.Daytime photos are bright and natural and outside overcast skies are shown in detail without sacrificing color in the darker areas, while interior shots have great balance and contrast, but it’s here the camera still struggles with shadows especially on 3x zoom. Compare it with the iPhone XS Max outdoors and OnePlus’s Ultrashot technology can’t compete with Apple’s Smart HDR feature. On the whole, images are not over-saturated, but not dull and unrealistic either. Blue skies are bright blue, not electric blue, for example.Wide-angle shots don’t have a fish-eye effect, and the exposure is consistent with the standard camera lens, which is a pleasant surprise. The 3x zoom mode is mostly very good, and I like the amount of detail in the photos, but images can sometimes have high contrast and saturation levels and can look unrealistic. What else is frustrating? The 48-megapixel mode is hidden away in Pro mode and bizarrely found by tapping the JPEG button.Night Scape has been improved a lot over the early software builds. I took many night shots in Taipei city, and it proved OnePlus’s statement that the Night Scape mode is best used for cityscape shots. It definitely prefers more light, but it still improves pictures in almost darkness. The photos are rich and detailed, with stunning colors and deep, black night skies. The Night Scape software is rock-solid now too, without any glitches I dealt with early on.I’m pleased to say the early software problems that marred my enjoyment of the OnePlus 7 Pro’s camera have been cured. This is a big step forward, as trusting the camera will take a good photo when I want it to is important if it’s the only camera in your pocket. The versatility offered by the three lenses is very welcome, along with a good portrait mode and video, making the OnePlus 7 Pro’s camera the best the company has made.The rule is: Buy a OnePlus phone, get flagships specs, no compromise. This hasn’t changed for the 7 Pro. The top model comes with a Snapdragon 855 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage space. It’s a monster, and one of the fastest phones you can buy. Other models all have the same chip, and varying levels of memory.It’s super fast, incredibly capable, and you won’t wish for anything more. Here are the benchmarks:These are all among the very highest we’ve tested, matched only by the Xiaomi Mi 9, and beating most of the Galaxy S10 range, and even the iPhone XS. Playing games is a breeze, and there’s a new Fnatic Mode — created with the help of the eponymous esports team — that blocks out notifications and boosts performance.The phone is running Android 9 Pie with the April 2019 security patch onboard, with version 9.5 of Oxygen OS over the top. OnePlus’ software is strong. It’s similar in style and design to Google’s version of Android on the Pixel, with a slide-up app tray, consistent app icon designs, and a logical settings menu. It’s more customizable, too.The rule is: Buy a OnePlus phone, get flagships specs, no compromise.It’s hard to find major faults. It is stripped right down, and doesn’t even come with a music player. There are a few graphical glitches like the Clear All button flickering when you drop the notification shade down slowly or slightly. The slide-in panel on the left of the home screen isn’t especially helpful, and I rarely use it. The Google Feed from the Pixel phones is more helpful.Google Assistant here is called into action using a short press of the sleep/wake key, as OnePlus has implemented its own gesture navigation system. These gesture controls are decent, but not always very precise, and are quick to misinterpret what you want. Swiping up to exit a mis-launched app often results in scrolling, for example, and the side-screen swipes to go back can be slow to react. Additionally, the included silicone case has a lip that makes gesture controls awkward, exasperating the situation. This may be fixed when the phone gets updated to Android Q, which is standardizing gesture controls across Android phones.There’s a brand-new haptic engine and software, making the OnePlus 7 Pro the first Android phone to seriously challenge the wonderfully tactile vibrations on the iPhone. They’re subtle yet pointed, and it’s genuinely pleasant to leave them on and feel the clicks throughout the OS, from typing to tapping the camera shutter release. It’s lovely, especially the way it helps launch shortcut menus for copy/paste, for example.Finally, Zen Mode shuts you out of the phone for 20 minutes, and you can’t cancel it when started. Perfect for those power naps when you want zero distractions.When you hear a phone has a 4,000mAh battery, you automatically expect strong performance. Initially, the OnePlus 7 Pro’s battery life was disappointing, and on at least one day of heavy use it needed recharging in the early evening. Since then, software updates have made better use of the cell’s capacity. Traveling with the phone and using dual SIMs, the OnePlus 7 Pro lasted all day, every day using the latest software. It matched the performance of a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus that was put through similar use, and that’s an improvement over before when a day’s worth of use was only achievable with moderate use.Still, don’t expect it to match the Huawei P30 Pro’s astonishing battery life. I ran a 1,080p YouTube video at full brightness on the phone, and the battery lasted 11 hours 50 minutes, falling way short of the 16 hours from the P30 Pro. It did beat many other phones, though, even the Pixel 3a XL and the Galaxy S10.Warp Charge, the name given to OnePlus’s mega-fast charging system, offers some consolation. It’s made to go from zero to 50% in 20 minutes, and in our tests it took 20 minutes to go to 53% from 15%, then 40 minutes to go to 83 percent. In total, it took an hour and 10 minutes to get to 100% from 15%. A quick charging squirt does soften the blow when the 7 Pro is about to run out earlier than expected, but you only get that speed when you use the included charger and USB Type-C cable.There’s no wireless charging. Again. I could excuse this when the phone cost around $550, but it’s much harder when you have to pay $670 at the minimum, let alone $750. Wireless charging, while not as fast as cable charging, is very convenient, and the vast majority of flagship phones have it. The OnePlus 7 Pro doesn’t, and this time it’s a bigger black mark against it than it was when the phone was much cheaper. I continue to miss it.There’s good news for in-display fingerprint sensor haters, as the one in the OnePlus 7 Pro is solidly reliable. The sensor is the same as we’ve seen before, but the lens is new and so is the software. The difference is considerable over many others, including the one on the OnePlus 6T. The face unlock feature is a great addition, and is quickly usable despite the camera needing to pop up first.Audio is a high point. There are stereo speakers — one on the bottom, and an oversized speaker at the top of the device facing forward — and they’re loud enough to make the phone’s body vibrate at maximum volume, yet still sound good. There’s no headphone jack, but Bluetooth has AptX HD for the best possible quality when playing compatible content. There’s Dolby Atmos onboard too.Finally, I tested out the dual-SIM capability, and it worked perfectly. It’s easy to alter the settings and use one SIM for calls and the other for data, plus there’s a little SIM icon in the text bar when sending SMS, allowing a quick switch to send the message using either SIM.The OnePlus 7 Pro starts at $670 for the mirror gray version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage space, or $700 for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The nebula blue or almond version also comes in 8GB/256GB at $700, and the top-of-the-range 12GB/256GB OnePlus 7 Pro is $750 and only comes in nebula blue. You can buy the OnePlus 7 Pro from OnePlus’ website, and in the U.S. through T-Mobile stores and online.The warranty period is one year in the U.S., and two years in the U.K., and it covers problems related to the hardware but not when related to misuse or water damage.The OnePlus 7 Pro is not the absolute bargain I’ve come to expect from OnePlus, but for what you get the price is extremely reasonable. The screen alone is worth the price, matched with the performance and camera — this is yet another highly-recommended OnePlus phone. Try not to be too tempted by the 12GB/256GB model though, as the 8GB/256GB model will be just as capable and save you a little money.The OnePlus 7 Pro is still cheaper than almost all other flagship phones available today, but it is more expensive than the OnePlus 6T, and is the most expensive OnePlus phone ever. This is reflected in the design, the screen, the battery, and all of the other technology inside. But because you can potentially spend $750 on a OnePlus 7 Pro, it’s a relatively short jump to the very best phones on sale at the moment. The $900 Galaxy S10 is excellent, as is the $1,000 iPhone XS, and the $800 Google Pixel 3.If you want to save some money, the Google Pixel 3a should be your top consideration. At just $400, you get a promise of speedy software updates for three years, the one of the best cameras on a phone, solid battery life, and helpful artificial intelligence features. Additionally, the $500 Asus Zenfone 6 has new software that’s reminiscent of OnePlus’s clean, almost stock OxygenOS, plus a big battery and decent camera.This is a phone packed with the very latest tech, inside and out, and will last for several years. There’s no reason not to expect two to three years from the OnePlus 7 Pro, and the only reason to upgrade before this will be for a personal need to own the latest models. Software updates aren’t as regular as on a Pixel phone, but they’re still more regular than many other manufacturers. Additionally, OnePlus is a part of the Android Q beta program, making a quick update to the next version of Android on the 7 Pro highly likely.Once again, the OnePlus 7 Pro does not have an IP rating. The company said gaining this rating costs money, and claims the phone still has all the rubber ports and silicone rings to protect the device in the real world. But it does not say the phone is water resistant, and the warranty does not cover water damage in any way. It’s a confusing message, and one that would be more easily translated to people by simply getting an IP rating. We are paying more for the phone at the moment, after all, so any “savings” from not having one aren’t instantly visible.Yes, absolutely. The previous software related downsides have been fixed, and the battery life has got better, despite still not quite living up to the large cell capacity’s promise. The one thing that hasn’t (and won’t) change is the fact the phone is quite heavy. Other than that, OnePlus astonishingly continues its streak of creating superb phones that give us practically everything we could want, at a price that’s still more affordable than the competition.Updated on July 22, 2019: Added in new comments on the camera, battery life, screen, and software. Added the Asus ZenFone 6 as a possible alternative. Increased score to 4.5/5."
66,OnePlus 7T,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-7t-review/,"The OnePlus 7T is the most intuitive high-end smartphone you can buy. Everything about it is accessible and pleasing. Don’t take this simplicity as a codeword for basic, as the OnePlus 7T is anything but basic. It has every feature you need, none of the ones you don’t, and a few interesting additions you didn’t know you wanted.OnePlus’ careful updating over the OnePlus 7 means if you have a OnePlus 5T, a Samsung Galaxy S8, or another phone from about two years ago, this is going to be a significant upgrade with all the modern tech you want, without spending hundreds of dollars on a larger phone that feels like overkill. The OnePlus 7T is the upgrade pick many have been waiting for.Think the OnePlus 7T looks different to other phones? You’re right, the flat-not-curved screen has an unusual 20:9 aspect ratio and measures 6.55 inches. This makes the 7T taller than some phones, but not quite as tall and thin as some Sony Xperia phones, which have 21:9 aspect ratio screens. OnePlus said the ratio makes the screen more immersive, but that’s not the benefit I noticed. It makes the phone really comfortable to hold; it’s not as wide as many big-screen phones, like the iPhone 11 Pro Max, but it still has a big screen.The body is otherwise familiar territory for OnePlus. Neatly curved sides blend into the back of the phone perfectly, the glass has an anti-glare coating and a special film underneath the top later to give it a metallic finish, and the helpful slider on the side of the phone lets you change profiles quickly. While OnePlus is practiced in this design, the new camera array is very different. The circular bump contains three lenses and a flash unit, and OnePlus’s intention with it is to disguise this, so you don’t notice how many lenses there are on the back of the 7T.Does it work? Opinions will definitely differ, as it’s a challenging look. Part Lumia 1020 and part Motorola G7, it can’t be described as pretty, and the horizontal alignment of the lenses is jarring against the circular bump. One thing it does is make the OnePlus 7T look different to any previous OnePlus phone, but it’s part of a growing number of phones with odd camera lens arrays on the back this year, so it can’t claim to be unique, or even the most unattractive design choice out there at the moment.Hold the OnePlus 7T in your hand, and you’ll not worry about the camera lens bump. It’s slim at 8mm, lightweight at 190 grams and the taller than usual body means even those with relatively small hands will be able to manage the 6.53-inch screen with ease. That said, it needs a case because the body is quite slippery, and the materials don’t feel as high quality as the OnePlus 7 Pro, or Samsung’s Galaxy S10 range.The OnePlus 7T isn’t a stunner, but it’s not bland or unattractive either. It’s pretty without being too flashy, and quirky without being objectionable. I’m going to keep coming back to this point — it’s simple, you’ll like it, and won’t feel the need to update again very soon if you buy it.The three lenses on the back of the 7T consist of a main 48-megapixel lens with optical image stabilization and an f/1.6 aperture, a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens with electronic stabilization, and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens.OnePlus has improved its UltraShot engine for taking photos in difficult lighting conditions and added several new modes including portrait mode and Nightscape mode for the ultra-wide lens, along with a fun macro mode.Confusingly, macro mode is activated using a separate button at the top of the camera viewfinder, rather than a mode selected using the slider above the shutter button.The OxygenOS camera app is a bit confusing generally, and I don’t understand why the Settings button is hidden away under the slide-up menu, instead of along the top of the screen like almost all other camera apps; but I digress.With it working, the OnePlus camera has beaten every other manufacturer in making a macro mode that actually takes usable photos, due to the images being 16 megapixels. You can genuinely get close up to an item, without dealing with a ton of camera shake or an out-of-focus viewfinder, which is what you get using clip-on macro lenses. It’s an excellent, fun, creative new mode that works well.You’ll notice it works on all three lenses, but it’s technically using the ultra-wide-angle lens,m and simply cropping in when you choose one of the lens options.How about Nightscape? It’s solid, and an improvement on what I saw with early versions of the 7 Pro. For example, it added warmth, atmosphere, and detail to a very low light shot of a seafront, which is exactly what I want from a night mode. I saw more atmosphere in most of the OnePlus 7T’s photos, whether it was with the standard or wide-angle lens, and was rarely disappointed. The 7T’s camera may not look great on the body, but it takes pictures that are natural, detailed, and sharp.Once you get used to the camera app, it’s simple to exploit all its features, and none of them have extended wait times or annoying pauses. It all works quickly, effectively, and simply.OnePlus has imported the same Fluid AMOLED screen tech from the 7 Pro for the 7T, which means the same 90Hz refresh rate, but the resolution is 2400 x 1080 pixels due to the 20:9 aspect ratio. The teardrop notch has been reduced in size by 31%, and the brightness of the display has been increased by 27% over the OnePlus 7 to 1,000nits total.The 90Hz refresh rate is wonderful. It brings a smoothness to the display’s performance you don’t usually see on Android phones in general. It’s an iPhone-level of smoothness (even if iPhones have 60Hz screens), especially scrolling through apps like Twitter or Google Photos. There’s no jerkiness, no stutters, and you can scan content in a way that’s not possible with 60Hz screens. It’s not a gimmick; it is a real reason to buy the OnePlus 7T.The flatness of the panel ages the design though. The screen is bright, but the colors are a little muted, even when you select the Vivid color mode. Compare it to the iPhone 11 Pro and it lacks life, and otherwise vibrant videos appear rather washed out. The auto-brightness mode is also poor and usually sets the brightness much too low.It’s not a gimmick; it is a real reason to buy the OnePlus 7T.OnePlus has used the Snapdragon 855 Plus for the 7T, so it’s not lacking power. This is the same chip inside gaming phones like the Asus ROG Phone 2. My review model has 8GB of RAM. Here are some of the benchmark results:If the screen underwhelms, the OnePlus 7T’s performance is the opposite. Fast, fluid, and suitable for all everyday tasks as well as some hardcore mobile gaming, the 7T is the performance powerhouse phone I have come to expect from OnePlus. The AnTuTu 3D score smashes every other Android phone we’ve tested so far and is only beaten by the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, and the 3DMark test is similarly class-leading. It’s an absolute monster.The OnePlus 7T is the first OnePlus phone to come with Android 10 installed, and among the first phone to launch with it, underneath OxygenOS 10.0. It contains 370 optimizations over version 9, from changes in gesture speed to making sure the app switcher works in landscape and portrait orientation. OxygenOS is neatly organized, doesn’t require much learning, and is free from massive design alterations over Google’s version of Android, yet still individual enough that it’s distinctly a OnePlus creation.I like Zen Mode, which shuts down the phone’s notifications and incoming distractions for a period of time, which has now been increased to 60 minutes from 20 minutes. The gestures are excellent, and they’re standardized from Google on Android 10, so most Android phones launching with Android 10 should be using it. Swipe left and right from the edge of the screen to go back a step; it’s intuitive and easy to learn. The haptic motor has been improved, and the haptics are a step closer to the brilliant OnePlus 7 Pro in the 7T.There have been some issues, though. Notifications haven’t always shown up, apps haven’t always installed from Google Play without restarting the phone first, and although the gesture system is faster than before, it doesn’t always register upward swipes for either the app switcher or to exit an app either, and instead just doesn’t perform either. These quibbles will likely be cured in an update.A 3,800mAh battery gives a day’s worth of moderate use, with at least 20% remaining at the end of the night. Use the phone heavily and this figure drops. Gaming, in particular, puts some strain on the cell, and the phone does get quite warm to the touch under hard use. I’m still assessing the battery life on the OnePlus 7T, and will update when more figures are obtained.It took less than 40 minutes to go from 17% to full, after I didn’t charge the phone overnight.What doesn’t need to be examined further is the charging. OnePlus’s new Warp Charge 30T system promises 70% charge in 30 minutes, and a full charge in about an hour, and I cannot refute these claims. It took less than 40 minutes to go from 17% to full, after I didn’t charge the phone overnight, meaning it was ready to go after I’d showered and had breakfast. It’s excellent, and everyone will be thankful it’s there in an hour of need. What’s more, you can use any recent (since the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition) OnePlus charger to get these speeds too, not just the one in the 7T’s box.OnePlus told me this is due to changes in the battery rather than the adapter, although it’s still proprietary tech, so not just any charger will achieve these speeds. I did have a problem with a third-party charger not charging the battery for longer than a few minutes though, despite the charger working correctly with other phones. It’s possible the battery is more sensitive than previous versions.The OnePlus 7T is $600 and will be sold worldwide, and the range has been simplified. There is one version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage space available, which might be a problem as there’s no MicroSD card slot. It comes in frosted silver or glacial blue colors.OnePlus offers a standard limited warranty that covers the phone from manufacturer defects one year from the date of purchase.Everything on the OnePlus 7T has been carefully considered, and there are no needless features. You get fast charging, a hyper-fast processor, uncomplicated software, as well as a simple-to-use and versatile camera that takes great photos. The OnePlus 7T is excellent, with no messing around.If we base comparisons on the OnePlus 7T costing less than $600, there are a few alternatives to consider.Apple’s $700 iPhone 11 comes complete with Apple’s latest software, camera enhancements, and a cool set of colors. It’s the best alternative. The price gap between the two phones isn’t trivial, but it’s not insurmountable.If the iPhone 11 is too expensive, take a look at the iPhone XR, which is still part of Apple’s 2019 range. At $600 it’s great value.The Asus Zenfone 6 is our pick for the best low-cost Android phone at $500, for which you get a massive battery, and unusual flip camera, and good software too. It just doesn’t look pretty.Finally, from OnePlus itself is the OnePlus 7 Pro. The $700 phone is better looking, has a great camera, feels more premium, and has the excellent 90Hz screen too.Want more options? Check out our favorite smartphones of 2019.Two to three years if not more. The battery will start to degrade by then. There is no IP-rating for water or dust resistance, and the phone is made of glass, so it is not especially durable. There is a transparent silicone case included in the box, and OnePlus also makes a selection of other more colorful cases to protect the phone, which we highly recommend you do.The final aspect to consider is the lack of expandable storage. There is only one OnePlus 7T phone and it has 128GB of storage space, so in the future, you may have to rely more on cloud storage options to keep photos, videos, and music off your phone.Yes. the OnePlus 7T is an absolute steal."
67,Oppo Reno,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-review/,"Oppo outdid itself with the design of the Find X, which remains one of the most stunning flagship phones ever made, and while the Reno 10x Zoom isn’t quite as dazzling, it’s still an eye-catching smartphone, especially at a price that undercuts much of the competition.But beauty is often only skin-deep, and the software experience on the Reno 10x is unacceptable at any price. As the frustrations mount, the Reno ownership experience starts to take a downturn, but the camera does help to balance things out. Here’s why Oppo’s latest is a bit of a gamble.This is one big, thick, chunk of a phone. It’s a 9.4mm thick, 210 gram slab of Gorilla Glass and aluminum, which on the back has a very cool frosted look broken only by a shiny sliver down the center to show the brand name and highlight the camera lenses. Our review model is in an unusual green color, but a more simple black model is also available. The lenses are flush to the body, unlike the Huawei P30 Pro, the iPhone XS Max, and the OnePlus 7 Pro — all major challengers to the Reno 10x Zoom.The frosted glass has a warm, soft touch to it and is very tactile; and while the main body is slippery, the shiny center line adds some grip. A high quality case designed to fit the phone is included in the box, but it’s a little annoying. The Reno 10x Zoom has a special pop-up camera that takes up the majority of the phone’s top, necessitating the case to be open there. The bottom is closed, and I was forever holding the phone the wrong way round, as most cases are open at the bottom for charger access.How special is the pop-up camera? It’s like a shark fin, raising out of the Reno as if it’s scything through the ocean. It looks so unique that you’ll want to show everyone. It’s clever too, as the front has the selfie camera while on the back is the main camera’s flash unit. The camera can be used for face unlock, but it’s not as good as the OnePlus 7 Pro or the Asus Zenfone 6, because it doesn’t intelligently open and close.Color OS 6 on the Reno 10x Zoom feels half-finished and out to annoy.I often accidentally activated it in my pocket, or just as I was about to put the phone away, forcing me to exit the camera app or to cancel the unlocking process. This raises concerns over the shark fin section getting knocked or broken, but it does disappear back in the body automatically in the event of a drop when you’ve got the camera app open. It’s a shame this doesn’t happen from the lock screen too.The overall Reno 10x Zoom package feels expensive, looks great, and the design has been well thought-out. The strange little nubbin on the rear panel is there to keep the camera lenses from getting scratched if you put the phone down face-up, for example. However, the massive weight makes it tiring to hold for long periods, and it’s always noticeable in your pocket.If the weight of the Reno 10x Zoom tires you out, then it’ll sometimes be a blessed relief to put the phone down, because the software and user experience can irritate. First the good stuff — it’s Android 9.0 Pie with the June 2019 Android Security Patch installed, and it’s never slow or sluggish. Now for the bad, it has Oppo’s Color OS 6 over the top, more bloatware than the end credits of a Marvel movie, and bugs that made me want to stop using the phone entirely.Color OS version 6 is better than version 5, but still a world away from Samsung’s user interface, stock Android, or even Huawei’s EMUI. How annoying is it? Example: Apps are spread across multiple home screens, but there is an App Drawer setting that greatly improves the look and usability. When it’s selected, Color OS still leaves all the app icons on the home screens so you have to remove them all in a long-winded clean up process. Other interfaces don’t do this, so why does Color OS?There are masses of pre-installed apps, some of which are not apps but hot-linked folders to online portals, and a wide variety of duplicates and questionable “services.” Oppo includes its own app store, which generates plenty of ads that appear mostly as notifications. I’ve also experienced connection problems on the phone, where periods of inactivity (such as overnight) or reconnecting after being out of Wi-Fi range for a while causes the Wi-Fi to hang, which only a restart cures. This, along with some ugly design choices — the ridiculously large buttons for settings in the notification shade, for example — the largely useless Smart Assistant that’s to the left of the home screen, and the clumsy “close all apps” system that never seems to close any apps at all, makes Color OS 6 on the Reno 10x Zoom feel half-finished and out to annoy.You look at the software on a big 6.6-inch OLED screen with a 2,340 x 1,080 pixel resolution. While lower in resolution than some other flagship Android phones, you won’t notice much of a difference — it’s crisp, colorful, and sharp.But the screen is not good in strong sunlight unless the brightness is turned up to maximum, and the auto-brightness is a little dimwitted, taking too long to adjust. When it does, it’s never quite enough to view comfortably. I do love the no-notch look though, which makes playing games and watching movies much more immersive.The Reno’s clumsy name refers to the camera’s special feature — a 10x zoom, meaning Oppo’s gunning for the Huawei P30 Pro. Oppo pushes the digital zoom feature even further than Huawei, as it reaches 60x compared to the P30 Pro’s 50x. You won’t want to use 60x very often though, as it’s all pixels and no detail.A button on the viewfinder cycles through a 2x, 6x, and a 10x zoom level. Optical zoom is 5x, while everything else is a hybrid, so why isn’t there quick access to 5x? The 6x setting adds some hybrid features, and appeared to make shots less “wobbly” at this level of zoom. There is no obvious difference in quality.There is a separate button to activate the wide-angle camera, or you can use the button to scroll through all zoom levels. Switching between them is fast, and is accompanied by a pleasing transition as you move between zoom levels. At 6x the quality is good. In the right light, photos look superb and full of color, but on 10x especially when lighting is challenging, the color reproduction is muted. The 2x level is great, with lovely contrast and just the right amount of saturation to make pictures pop.Each photo, regardless of the lens or zoom level you use, has a welcome consistency. This makes it easier to take photos you like, without contemplating which lens will take the best shot.  The 13-megapixel f/3.0 telephoto lens is joined by two other lenses — a 48-megapixel f/1.7 main lens, and an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultra wide lens, both of which have optical image stabilization with added electronic stabilization in video mode. The total focal length is 16mm to 160mm, the same as the Huawei P30 Pro. The selfie camera has 16-megapixels.Get an idea for a photo, and there’s a great chance the Reno 10x Zoom has a lens to take it.The wide-angle camera is hurt by the low megapixel count, and the quality suffers, especially when compared directly with the Huawei P30 Pro’s 20-megapixel wide-angle camera. The Reno 10x Zoom defaults to 12-megapixels and uses pixel-binning to collect more light, but a 48-megapixel mode can be selected under the camera app’s settings. I couldn’t see any differences between the two on the phone’s screen, but the 48-megapixel shots will be better if you’re inclined to print out large scale versions.Night mode is good too, pulling in plenty of light. But like the P30 Pro, the camera is strong in low light without Night mode. With Night activated, the images are still atmospheric, without straying into the overly-brightened images we’ve seen with some night modes. Finally, selfies are good with a highly-adjustable beauty mode that’s as intrusive as you want it to be. It’s great to have such control, as many people only want a little smoothing to deal with odd lighting. The Reno 10x Zoom provides it, with a capable portrait mode, and some visually pleasing filters too.I love the versatility of the Reno’s camera and this kind of lens setup. Get an idea for a photo, and there’s a great chance the Reno 10x Zoom has a lens to take it, regardless of the time of day.The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom has a Snapdragon 855 processor inside, 8GB of RAM, and there’s 256GB of storage space. The SIM tray has space for a MicroSD card or a second SIM; but not both at the same time. Here are the benchmark results:The AnTuTu score is ahead of the Galaxy S10 and the iPhone XS, along with the Huawei P30 Pro, but is behind the OnePlus 7 Pro and the Xiaomi Mi 9. The 3DMark score is superb too, beating everything apart from the Red Magic 3 gaming phone, but the Geekbench scores are similar to the Galaxy S10 and OnePlus 7 Pro.Despite the software being annoying, it has not presented any performance problems, and is speedy, smooth, and mostly stable outside of the odd connection problems. All apps I tried ran without incident, and the hardware makes easy work of even the most graphically-intensive games.A big 4,065mAh battery is inside, and with moderate use it should last a couple of working days. But with heavy use — games, watching video, and normal use throughout the day — it’ll be down to 20% before going to bed. The good news is it definitely won’t give-up before the day is out. The large capacity battery makes the Reno reliable and easy to live with.In the box is an Oppo 20w VOOC charger, which isn’t as fast to charge as the Super VOOC system the company includes with some of the Find X models. Here, the phone recharges to full in about 90 minutes. There is no wireless charging.Putting it through a YouTube video test, playing a 1080p video at full brightness over Wi-Fi until the battery ran out, the Oppo Reno managed a respectable 13 hours 55 minutes. That’s similar to the Galaxy S10 Plus, which ran a little over 14 hours.I’ve already complained about the face unlock system elsewhere in the review, because while it works, the camera will often pop-up at inopportune moments. It is an option that’s not activated as standard, leaving you to use the in-display fingerprint sensor. Here it’s as reliable as the P30 Pro’s and the OnePlus 7 Pro, with an 8 or 9 out of 10 hit rate. Certainly not a disaster, so why fall back on the face unlock? It’s way easier to use with one hand, especially as the phone is heavy.The Reno does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack, but it does have dual speakers. Sound quality isn’t great, but it does get loud. On the software side, the Reno has Dolby Atmos but this only works with wired headphones or the built-in speakers. Using a set of Bluetooth headphones with the Reno revealed the sound quality is acceptable, but a little soft and lacking in character and depth.You can’t buy the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom officially in the U.S., but it is for sale in the U.K., Europe, China, and many other regions. It’s 700 British pounds, which converts over to $880, or 800 euros. It was released at the beginning of June and can be purchased through Carphone Warehouse with or without a contract, and retail partners including Laptops Direct.Oppo provides a two-year warranty on the device and battery, but this does not cover accidental damage, plus it has an interesting international warranty on the Reno 10x Zoom too. This operates wherever you are in the world if the phone goes wrong. Handy if you’re traveling.If you’re planning to buy a Reno 10x Zoom, make sure you actually buy the 10x Zoom version. Oppo also makes a standard Reno phone, which has very different specs — no zoom camera and lesser performance — for a lower price. It costs 450 British pounds ($566), so if you see what you think is a bargain Reno, just remember it may not be the one you want. On the same subject, the Reno 10x Zoom is available with a 5G modem on the EE network in the U.K..The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom’s camera is excellent, with strong abilities and some fun features. But the package is let down by its software, which frustrates more than it delights. The battery compensates for this, but the weight of the phone means you’ll always know it’s with you.Yes. The Huawei P30 Pro is the Reno 10x Zoom’s direct rival, and it’s the better purchase. The software is more reliable and user-friendly, the camera has even more features and takes even better pictures, plus the phone is lighter and more durable. However, Huawei’s ongoing situation in the U.S. is a cause for concern, and while the P30 Pro is a phone the company said it will keep issuing Android updates for, you may want to hold off until August.The other big rival for the Reno 10x Zoom is the OnePlus 7 Pro. It can’t match the 10x zoom feature, and it’s also a heavy little beast, but the screen is an absolute winner, and the camera generally is better than any OnePlus setup before it. The software is also much better than the Reno’s. Finally, it’s cheaper, and sold in the U.S..Then there are the old faithful: The Pixel 3 XL and the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus are both excellent, although the Pixel 4 will come in the not too distant future along with the next iPhone too. If you want something a little different, the Asus Zenfone 6 has its unusual flip camera, similar performance, and again, better software than the Reno.Durability is a downside of the shark fin camera, as the Reno 10x Zoom does not have any water or dust resistance. The glass is Gorilla Glass 6 all over, which should help it survive small drops, and the case inside the box is sturdy and even has a felt lining for added protection. It’s advisable to use it.The phone has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, and if you pick the 5G version, it’s as future-proofed in terms of hardware as you can get at the moment. However, Oppo’s software update schedule is a mystery. Oddly, the standard Reno but not the 10x Zoom is part of Google’s Android Q beta program, but this does bode well for the next version of the OS to arrive. It’s just the timeline that’s not clearNo. The Reno 10x Zoom isn’t a bad phone, doesn’t have a bad camera, and doesn’t wheeze along like it’s powered by a small rodent. In fact, these aspects of the phone are all excellent. It does, however, have problematic software. While this is the only major drawback, it’s a serious one. We interact with the software every time we pick up the phone, and it needs to be usable, reliable, and never annoying. That’s not always the case with Color OS. It’s not the first time this has been a drawback with an Oppo phone, but this time the stakes are much higher."
68,Pixel 3a,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-xl-review/,"Editor’s Note: The Pixel 4 XL smartphone has been announced with a faster processor and improved camera system, so you may want to wait and buy that new model. If you’re on a budget, however, this is a great time to buy a Google Pixel 3 XL at a deep discount.Google’s Pixel devices often come so close to being the perfect Android phones, but they falter on the same two things: design and battery life. Google got the design of its new Pixel 3 XL almost right this year, except for the ugly notch on the front of the phone. When compared to the rest of the smartphone market, it sticks out like a $900 sore thumb. Battery life is mediocre, especially when pitted against phones in this price range as well.But there’s so much else that’s right with the Pixel 3 XL, we are willing to accept these shortcomings. It has the absolute best software experience on any Android phone, period. You also will not find comparable artificial intelligence features anywhere else. As a cherry on top, you get a great screen and speakers, good performance, and a stunning camera yet again. Not to mention it’s one of the best Android phones that will get consistent software updates for quite some time. If you want the best Android experience, this is the best smartphone to buy — just try to ignore the notch.Looking for the notch-free, smaller Pixel 3? You can read our review here.The Pixel 3 XL has mostly the same features as the Pixel 3, a strategy Google started with earlier Pixel phones — and one Apple is using for the iPhone XS and XS Max. It means you don’t need to sacrifice features over which model you choose. But, physically, the phones aren’t identical, of course. The Pixel 3 XL has a larger screen — 6.3 inches versus the Pixel 3’s 5.5 inches — offering space for more pixels. The larger form-factor also allows for a larger battery. The only design difference this year is the massive notch on the top-front of the Pixel 3 XL, whereas the smaller Pixel 3 opts for chunky bezels around the screen.Design is subjective, but we think the notch is ugly, plain and simple. It juts too far into the screen, enough that it looks distracting. We don’t normally moan over the notch on a phone — the Essential phone has an elegant-looking notch, and the iPhone XS’ notch packs impressive hardware inside that give it a pass — but the Pixel 3 XL takes it a bit too far for simply adding a wide-angle lens. LG’s V40 has two cameras on the front, but the notch is much smaller. If the notch has to be this big, it’d be nice if Google included a Face ID-like unlocking method for the phone.If you can’t stand the size of the notch, you should buy the Pixel 3 — albeit at the expense of a larger screen size. Alternatively, we’ve rounded up a few ways to mask the notch if you really want the Pixel 3 XL’s larger screen.The notch is ugly, plain and simple. It juts into the screen way too much and looks distracting.If the front is Mr. Hyde, then the back is Dr. Jekyll — it is handsome. Google is sticking with the two-tone look, but instead of mixing glass and metal, it’s all glass on the rear. Google managed to matte out the entire surface, so it’s not as slippery as other phones and hides fingerprints, which is a frequent complaint we have for all-glass phones. We have read complaints about the back being easily scratched up, but we haven’t seen this on our unit. The Pixel 3 XL feels far more high-end than the Pixel 2 XL, but it’s still not as alluring as Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 or the iPhone XS.The fingerprint sensor on the back is in a good position, and it’s fast to react. You can also swipe up and down on it to access the notification shade, which helps with usability on such a large-screen phone.Like most big phones, the Pixel 3 XL can be a little unwieldy to manage with one hand — even for someone with large hands. We frequently found ourselves repositioning the phone up and down in our hand, in order to access the top or bottom part of the screen. We do love the larger screen real estate, but if you want to comfortably reach all parts of the phone’s screen, you may want to look at the 5.5-inch Pixel 3.Last year’s Google Pixel 2 XL suffered some issues with its screen, as some owners complained about a blue tint issue, as well as some other quality control problems. With the Pixel 3 XL, we do see a very faint line of screen burn-in at the top of the screen surrounding the notch.Now, don’t freak out. This is something we never would have noticed if we hadn’t seen reports of it online. In fact, we are certain most users won’t even notice — you have to really look hard for it. We thought the Pixel 2 XL problems were overblown, and we believe that to be the case here (we’ve seen this in other smartphones before, including those from Samsung). We’ll be keeping an eye on this to see if it develops into an actual problem, but there’s nothing to worry about with the screen on the Pixel 3 XL.Otherwise, the screen has a sharp 2,960 x 1,440 resolution, and it’s bright enough to see in direct sunlight outdoors (though you’ll need to max the brightness). Colors are vibrant, and there’s an option to tone down the saturation in the display settings if it’s too much for you. The screen delivers deep black levels, which helps the colors pop out even more.The great screen and speakers make watching movies and videos on the Pixel 3 XL a joy.Dual front-facing speakers return, which is why there’s a chin (the bezel below the screen) on the front. Google said the speakers are 40-percent louder than last year’s Pixel 2, and the difference is noticeable. The Pixel 3 XL sounds richer and more robust than its predecessor, and it easily got loud enough to fill a room. We prefer it over the bottom-firing speakers on the iPhone XS or the Note 9, because half the sound is usually directed away.The great screen and speakers make watching movies and videos on the Pixel 3 XL a joy.There’s no headphone jack, but Google wins some points for including USB Type-C earbuds in the box, as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack adapter (hint, hint, Apple). These USB-C earbuds have a few features similar to the Pixel Buds, wireless earbuds Google unveiled last year. Tap a button on the wire to access Google Assistant, and Assistant can also deliver alerts when notifications arrive on your phone. The earbuds sound good, and we love how speedy it is to access Assistant with them.Speaking of Google Assistant, you can squeeze the phone to trigger Google’s helper, just like last year.The Pixel 3 XL is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor with 4GB of RAM. The processor is on par with almost every Android flagship smartphone in 2018, but the RAM is low compared to other phones in this price range. For example, the OnePlus 6, Razer Phone 2, and Galaxy Note 9 come with 6GB of RAM. Whether you need a lot of RAM in a smartphone is still up for debate, and we’ve yet to run into any issues with performance on the Pixel 3 XL.Here are a few benchmark results:The scores are on the lower end of phones using the Snapdragon 845 processor. The Sony Xperia XZ3 scored 281,131 on AnTuTu, and the Note 9 follows with 273,992. The iPhone XS is still king with an almost unbeatable 334,325 AnTuTu score. All this being said, you won’t notice a difference in performance on the Pixel 3 XL. Apps open up quickly, and switching between them feels fluid. Games like Alto’s Odyssey and Breakneck performed smoothly without any problems whatsoever.There’s no MicroSD card slot, but there are options for 64GB or 128GB of internal storage. Google is still offering free photo storage for Google Photos in the original resolution, which should help free up internal storage.The most compelling features of the Pixel 3 XL, short of its camera, is its software and Google’s artificial intelligence capabilities. The phone runs Android 9 Pie, which is an excellent version upgrade that improves the look of the operating system, while adding brilliant tweaks such as the smart rotate button that prevents automatic screen rotations. We’ve explored Pie already, and you can read up on all the new features in our handy roundup.The software experience on the Pixel 3 XL is almost perfect. It’s filled with small touches that enhance the overall interface. The new “Flip to Shhh” feature easily lets you turn the phone over to trigger Do Not Disturb mode, and when you pick it back up, a small vibration lets you know the mode has turned off. The haptic vibrations throughout the phone in general feel stronger, though they’re not quite as fine-tuned as Apple’s taptic engine.One of our favorite features on the Pixel 2 makes a return — Now Playing. It uses on-device machine learning to identify songs playing in your surroundings and display it on the phone screen, before you decide to try and find it yourself. Now it’s even better on the Pixel 3, as you can see a history of the songs identified by the phone.We also tried out Gmail’s Smart Compose feature, which is coming to mobile first with the Pixel 3. It’s Google’s A.I. finishing sentences for you, which takes some effort out of writing addresses, phone numbers, and more. Google’s Duplex technology will also come to the Pixel 3 later this year. It lets you ask Assistant to book a restaurant reservation for you, and Assistant will place a call and handle everything itself. We tried it out earlier this summer, but we haven’t had a chance yet on the Pixel 3 because it’s not available yet. At first Duplex will only work in a handful of major cities, before expanding elsewhere.You’re stuck with Android 9 Pie’s gesture navigation system, which is manageable, but it’s not our favorite.But the cherry on top is Google’s Call Screening service. If you’re tired of answering robocalls, you can now tap the “Screen call” option when you get a phone call. Google Assistant will take the call, and tell the caller to say why they are calling. You’ll get a live transcription of what the person on the other end is saying. The real-time transcription is fairly accurate, though there are often errors sprinkled in. Regardless, you’ll know if it’s a genuine person or a robocall within the first five seconds of seeing the transcription. You can decide to answer the call, or mark it as spam. We’ve had the pleasure of using it on a few robocalls already, and it’s undoubtedly become one of our favorite features on the phone.All of the features mentioned above except “Flip to Shhh” are also coming to the Pixel 2 and the original Pixel.So why do we say the software experience is “almost” perfect? You’re stuck with Android 9 Pie’s gesture navigation system, which is manageable, but it’s not our favorite. There’s no option to go back to the traditional Android buttons. We’ve gotten accustomed to navigating Android on the Pixel 3 XL, but the system is not as intuitive as gestures on the iPhone XS.The Google Pixel 2’s camera was at the top of our list of best camera phones since its release, and while we have plenty more phones to go for 2018 before we can crown a winner, the Pixel 3 XL is up there. The Pixel 3 XL is a solid improvement, all while maintaining the single-lens camera system on the back. It’s a 12.2-megapixel lens with a f/1.8 aperture. We’ve yet to notice any lag in the camera app, and it just feels more fluid than ever before, with a much more intuitive layout.Overall, expect photos to be incredibly detailed and sharp. That’s Google’s improved HDR+ in action, thanks to a new image sensor that should help with better dynamic range and low light. We have noticed, however, that photos tend to look a tad more saturated on the Pixel 3 XL over the Pixel 2 XL. This isn’t the case all the time, and sometimes the Pixel 3 does a better job managing skin tone than the Pixel 2.In low light, there’s a good deal of grain, but the Pixel 3 XL manages to preserve enough detail for photos to look good. The iPhone XS and Note 9 tend to do a better job in dealing with noise.The Pixel 3 XL adds a new feature called Top Shot, which helps preserve key moments you may have missed. This works because the Pixel 3 in general takes a number of shots before and after you tap the shutter icon. So if someone looks away right when you take a photo, Top Shot lets you see all the photos before and after you tapped the button, and it will automatically recommend the best one. The recommendations aren’t always perfect, but we have managed to save photos we otherwise would’ve missed. That being said, we do wish the image quality was better. The best image resolution is saved for the photo you actually snapped, while all the extra photos are stuck with a much lower resolution.More impressive is Super Res Zoom, which reduces the noise in photos captured by digitally zooming in. There’s no optical zoom on the Pixel 3 XL, so zooming in to capture a photo won’t look as good as using the 2x optical zoom on phones like the LG V40, Galaxy Note 9, or the iPhone XS, but the results are close. It works far better than expected, and if you zoom in past the telephoto lenses on those dual camera systems, the Pixel 3’s image quality wins almost every time.While having a secondary telephoto lens would have been nice, we’ve found ourselves using the Pixel 3’s half-zoom much more because of the improved image quality, which is good enough to share to social media.Portrait Mode is also better than ever before, and we think the Pixel 3 XL takes the cake for having the best Portrait Mode over any other phone — that applies to the front and rear camera. It accurately identifies the edges of a subject (with the occasional error), and the bokeh effect is much stronger than on the Pixel 2. Details are incredibly sharp, especially in low light, which is something that can’t be said for many other phones.Portrait Mode on the Pixel 3 XL is one of our favorite modes to use, and it often works incredibly well on non-living objects as well. You can now edit the blur intensity after you take a photo, which is a feature Apple also just introduced on the iPhone XS.We love the addition of the wide-angle lens on the front, which means there are two selfie cameras now. Both are 8-megapixel cameras, with the main lens having a f/1.8 aperture, and a secondary wide-angle lens with a f/2.2 aperture. You can use the wide-angle lens for group shots, or to simply take in more of the scenery in your selfie. Switching between both cameras is incredibly fluid, and Portrait Mode works with both, so photos can stand out even more. Image quality is good, though not as sharp as the rear cameras. It’s a lot of fun playing around with the wide-angle lens, and we sorely wish Google added one to the back of the phone for further versatility.There are a few more notable camera features built into the Pixel 3 camera. Photobooth, for example, uses Google’s Clips technology to predict the best time to take a photo. It’s fun, but the feature is hidden away. The same is true for Playground and Google Lens. Playground lets you add augmented reality stickers and characters into your photos, though we haven’t found them too enticing to use, and Google Lens lets you point the camera at objects, landmarks, business cards, and more for information. What’s neat is Google has injected Google Lens directly into the Pixel 3’s camera, so as long as you point the camera at something, you’ll see Lens Suggestions pop up on the viewfinder in case you want more details.The Google Pixel 3 XL’s camera takes excellent photos, but the competition has caught up.The Pixel 3 can also now automatically track moving subjects in videos to maintain focus, and it works really well. There’s one more feature called Night Sight, and it’s meant for super dark environments. It’s now available as an update to the Google Camera app, and it uses A.I. to fill in color for ultra dark photos, dramatically improving them. We dive more into detail here, but take a look at the two photos below to see just how it can improve your low-light photos.Top Shot, Lens Suggestion, Photobooth, Super Res Zoom, and Motion Auto Focus are exclusive features to the Pixel 3, but if you have a Pixel 2 or the first Pixel, then you should have received an update adding Night Sight and adjustable portrait blur.The Google Pixel 3 XL’s camera takes excellent photos, but the competition has caught up, and that means the Pixel 3 XL is not always going to take the absolute best photo. Its strengths are in the zero shutter lag camera, portrait mode, having excellent detail, and good low-light capabilities, but its weakness is color tone, as the camera’s photos often had a different hue that wasn’t similar to reality.Our biggest disappointment with the Pixel 3 XL is battery life; it’s manageable, but if you’re a heavy user, don’t expect to get through a full day without charging up once. We started most of our days with 100 percent at 7:30 a.m. — with heavy usage, including lots of picture taking, video and music streaming, browsing, and some gaming, our Pixel 3 XL hit 25 percent by 3 p.m. with about 3.5 hours of Screen on Time.With lighter to medium usage, the phone naturally fares better. We managed to hit 8 percent by 10:30 p.m. once, mostly using the phone for music streaming and browsing. Still, we’d have liked to see Google pack a bigger battery like Huawei did with the P20 Pro, ensuring the phone made it well past a day. At the very least, fast charging support with the included 18 watt wall charger and USB-C to USB-C charging cable will give you a good deal of juice in just 15 minutes.Google’s A.I. is also one of the best at accurately suggesting the time the phone is expected to die based on usage. This type of feature is available on a variety of other phones, but usually the estimates for battery life when you have 20 percent or so remaining are wildly exaggerated and never accurate. Google’s guesses are reasonable and genuinely helpful.The Pixel 3 XL is the first Pixel phone from Google to support wireless charging, and it’s a welcome addition. Your phone won’t charge any faster, but not having to fish around for a cable is convenient. Google sells a separate Pixel Stand wireless charger as a separate accessory, but it does so much more than charge the phone. We took a closer look here. but it’s safe to say this is the wireless charger to buy if you get the Pixel 3. It offers up fast access to Google Assistant, can turn into a digital photo frame, can turn the display completely off or turn on Do Not Disturb mode when the phone is placed on it, and it can help wake you up by blasting ambient light 15 minutes before your alarm. It’s well worth its $79 price.The Google Pixel 3 XL is available for sale, and prices start at $899. The phone is sold through Google and Verizon, but if you buy it from the Google Store, you can use it on any major carrier network in the U.S. You can check out all your options for buying this phone in our Pixel 3 XL buying guide.Google offers a standard one-year warranty that protects the phone from manufacturer defects from the date of purchase.The Google Pixel 3 XL won’t wow with its looks, but show off the camera and its A.I. capabilities, and you’ll see jaws drop. It has one of the best cameras in a smartphone, and hands down the best software experience on an Android phone.If you’re looking for a discount, take a peek at the best Google Pixel deals as well as the best smartphone deals available now.Yes. Your first option if budget is a concern should be the smaller and cheaper Pixel 3. It can do everything the Pixel 4 XL or Pixel 3 XL can do, but it has a smaller screen, a smaller battery, and it costs a little less.Next, check out the Galaxy Note 9. You get great hardware with good performance and a good camera — especially in low light — but its software isn’t as polished as the Pixel. It’s also a bit more expensive.If you’re looking for the best bang for your buck, you should wait for the OnePlus 6T. It will likely cost around $500, and it will have great performance and a simple software experience, but its camera may be lacking. Alternatively, if you don’t mind iOS, buy the iPhone XS. It has a fluid software experience as well as fast software updates (or wait for the cheaper iPhone XR to come out).The Google Pixel 3 XL is a glass sandwich with an aluminum frame in the middle. While the Gorilla Glass 5 is durable and has a matte texture that avoids fingerprints, it’s still glass that can shatter in the event of a drop. Make sure you nab a case. Google has improved the water resistance on the Pixel phone, however, as it now has an IP68 rating. That means you can take it underwater up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.Because this is a phone straight from Google, you can expect to receive software version updates for two years, and three years of security updates. We expect the Pixel 3 XL to last you three to four years, but likely more. Considering how many of the Pixel 3 XL’s features are coming to the Pixel 2 and Pixel 1, expect this phone to receive some fresh upgrades every year.Yes. Buy this phone if you prize software and camera over everything else, and you want a big screen. You’ll learn to forgive the notch.Updated on November 14, 2018: We’ve updated this review to include details about Night Sight on the Pixel 3 camera."
69,Pixel 4,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-4-review/,"The Google Pixel 4 is flawed. Let’s just get that out of the way right from the start. This is no sculpted beauty that will set your pulse aflame the moment you lay hands on it.Battery size jumps straight out from the spec sheet as a potential problem, and it is a problem. But the Pixel 4 has an incredible camera, it is seriously speedy, and it does things that no other phone can do right now.The Pixel 3 was a great phone, and the Pixel 4 improves on it in many ways. It showcases the most exciting things Google is doing with software and machine learning. It’s also a damn good phone to have in your pocket. Can you learn to love it despite the flaws?Want a big-screen phone? Google might have a better fit, so check out our Pixel 4 XL review.The Pixel 4, like every flagship phone on the market, is a glass sandwich with a metal frame. Traditionally, the Pixel line has been recognizable thanks to the two-tone finish on the back, but Google changed things up this year with a major design overhaul.The back is a single sheet of glass with very slight curves right at the edges, and it’s broken only by the square camera module at the top left, which protrudes slightly and houses the dual-lens camera and flash. There’s no fingerprint sensor, since the front-facing camera and sensor array support face unlock now, which is much like Apple’s Face ID.Speaking of Apple, casting an eye over all the other flagships out there, the Pixel 4 most closely resembles the iPhone 11 Pro, though it’s taller, lighter, and not as wide. Google’s design team also chose to hide the camera lenses on the back, so they are much less pronounced than they are on the iPhone and less likely to trigger trypophobia. If you asked me who wore it best, I’d say the Pixel, but it’s interesting how similar the broad brushstrokes of these designs are.My dull review unit was glossy black with a matte black, aluminum frame with rounded corners. I was hoping for the limited edition Oh So Orange, which went to my colleague and his Pixel 4 XL. The orange and white models are more striking and feel more Google. A burst of personality peeps through in the power button on the left edge, which is contrasting white, with black volume controls below it.The Pixel 4 does boast stereo speakers, but one of them is bottom-firing, which makes it easy to accidentally cover when you hold the phone in landscape, especially when you’re gaming.The glass front, like the back, curls slightly at the edges to meet the frame. Google has shaved down the bezels on three sides, but not the top. This forehead gives it a dated look. There’s a reason for it, however. That’s where all the cool tech lives.That top bezel contains a bunch of sensors for secure face unlock, a radar system based on Project Soli, and a front-facing camera. The face unlock is swift and doesn’t seem to be fazed by low light or even darkness. Most of the time the Pixel 4 is unlocked and ready on the last screen I was using by the time I get it into position. Compared to Face ID, I find it refreshing not to have to swipe as an extra stage here, but if you’re worried about not seeing the lock screen, you’ll be glad to know it’s a setting you can change.There’s only one circumstance where I miss the fingerprint sensor and it’s for access to my banking app, which has not yet been updated to accept my face as a shortcut to entry — hopefully this will come soon.Motion Sense is the name Google picked for its air gestures. We’ve seen this concept before, but I expect Google to have done it better — after all, Project Soli has been running for years. Motion Sense is simple right now and quite limited. The Pixel 4 will drop the volume of an incoming call or alarm as soon as it detects your hand closing in. It’s a small thing, but a good one. It will also bring the screen to life or put it to sleep based on your proximity.More exciting is the idea of gestures you can employ to control functionality, but Google is starting small, so you can wave to cut the volume of a call or snooze an alarm, and you can wave to skip forward or back through the tracks when you’re playing music. There’s a subtle light at the top of the screen to show you when this swipe gesture is working, but it’s really easy to get the hang of.The orange and white models are far more striking and feel more Google.Beyond that, Google has included a wee demo app with Pokemon in it, which my daughter enjoyed waving at for 30 seconds or so. I think Motion Sense will grow in the future, and I like how it works right now, but it’s subtle. I’ll definitely wave to snooze alarms and maybe to skip a track while I’m cooking and don’t want to touch the phone, but it’s not a reason to buy a Pixel 4 over another phone, yet.With a 5.7-inch OLED screen, the Pixel 4 is nice to gaze at. The 2,280 x 1,080-pixel resolution is plenty sharp and the brightness cranks all the way up when you need it to, making the screen comfortably legible in everything from pitch darkness to direct sunlight. What really sets this screen apart, though, is the 90Hz refresh rate. If you’re a gamer, then you already know about the importance of a high refresh rate to reduce motion blur for fast-paced action. It can make scrolling down a web page or swiping around your phone much smoother, too, which also makes it feel faster.Gaming phones kicked off this trend, but OnePlus has run with it and I’m glad to see Google picking it up. Every phone manufacturer should adopt a higher refresh rate in its displays. We spend so much time staring at these screens that any improvement — anything that makes it more comfortable — is to be applauded and encouraged. I’m finding the Pixel 4 screen is great for browsing the web and watching videos, but it feels most like an upgrade when I’m gaming. Coming from a Pixel 3, there’s a tangible difference, and while it’s not the same as the leap from LCD to OLED, it is a step up.The smartphone photography wars have intensified in the last couple of years and we are the beneficiaries. You can capture incredibly detailed vistas that bring the places you visit to life, you can snap amazing portrait shots with that coveted bokeh effect that blurs the background, you can take photos in dark environments that aren’t just noisy blurs, and now you can zoom in from afar without losing much detail.If you’d asked me last year what kind of second lens Google would add to its main camera, I would have guessed an ultra-wide-angle, but the Pixel 4 got a telephoto lens instead. You’ve got a 12.2-megapixel lens that uses the same sensor as the Pixel 3, though it has a bigger, f/1.7 aperture to let in more light. It’s paired with a 16-megapixel telephoto lens with an f/2.4 aperture. Both lenses have optical image stabilization (OIS).One of the main reasons I loved the Pixel 3 and stuck with it as my main phone was the camera, principally because it shoots great photos more often than not in any situation. I think the Pixel 4 camera is even better.The balance in shots, the realistic colors, and the strong contrast combine to create photos that you want to share and come back and look at again. The camera in the Pixel 4 feels faster, so you can capture that off-the-cuff moment and preserve it. Google has added dual exposure controls, so if you tap on the subject you get two sliders at the top that you can use to tweak the brightness or shadows. I find the automatic settings tend to get great results, but if you want to capture a silhouette, or take some shadow off a face, these new options are handy.The headline addition for the Pixel 4 is the zoom. This is a tricky one because I still think I’d prefer to have a wider angle option than a zoom option, like on the new iPhone 11, but there are situations when it undeniably comes in handy. Whether you’re capturing your child’s on-stage debut at school, shooting your idol from afar at a gig, or trying to cut out some ugly foreground, the zoom function is there for you.Google’s setup allows for 2x optical zoom, but you can go up to 8x with the digital zoom and the quality is still quite impressive. Simply pinch on screen and the slider appears, enabling you some fine control over your zoom level. It’s just as well there’s OIS, because even with it, you’ll see some blur when you zoom right in, as you can see in some photos above.My favorite thing about Google’s camera is the photos it takes of people. It’s fast to recognize faces, and there’s even a setting in the camera app that lets you prioritize photos where the faces of the people you shoot most frequently look best. Photos of my kids, my wife, my cat, the rest of my family, and my friends are the ones that matter most and the Pixel 4’s camera captures photos I love. I think that’s what most people really want in their smartphone camera.Night Sight continues to improve, though the changes are subtle over the Pixel 3. What’s new is the astrophotography option which pops up if you’re outside at night and you point the phone at the night sky. Sadly, though not unusual for Scotland, it has been rainy and cloudy since I got my Pixel 4, but even after just a taste of what this can do I’m planning on some midnight adventures to shoot the night sky.When the astrophotography option pops up, you simply tap to take the shot and it takes a really long exposure to capture more light. It captures for around four minutes and you really need to have your phone resting on something static, or ideally on a tripod to get good results. It’s by no means something you must have on your phone, but it highlights how far smartphone photography has come, and you can snap some stunning shots.After a few days with the Pixel 4 camera I can confidently say I love it. Is it as good as the iPhone 11 Pro’s triple-lens camera, or Samsung or Huawei’s quad-lens cameras? I’ll leave that for better photographers than me to work out — which is a point worth noting — the top smartphone cameras are so good now that you really need to know your stuff to point out the frankly minuscule reasons why one shot is better than another. Much of it comes down to personal taste. The Pixel 4 is missing that extra ultra-wide-angle option, which can be great in situations when you want to cram more in, but what is here works beautifully.The Pixel 4 is fast. Really fast. Navigation feels slick. Apps and games load quickly. I’ve been playing Call of Duty: Mobile, Asphalt 8, and Shadowgun Legends. They run perfectly and they look great. The combination of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 with 6GB of RAM and Google’s Android, free of any superfluous extras, makes for truly impressive speed.Here are some benchmark results:Those scores are among the highest we’ve recorded. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus scored 358,160 with AnTuTu and 4,656 with 3DMark. Though it’s also worth noting that the OnePlus 7T managed an AnTuTu result of 396,370 and the iPhone 11 Pro scored 455,778. It’s still odd that the Pixel 4 scored so high, especially since the OnePlus 7T has a Snapdragon 855 Plus and 8GB of RAM, but I ran it again and it got 408,735 — that’s a bit faster than the iPhone 11, though it doesn’t match the Pro models.Putting the numbers aside, it feels smoother than any other Android phone I’ve used. That’s really a combination of the processing power, the screen, and Google’s software mastery.I would like to see more storage as standard, though. The basic model of the Pixel 4 has just 64GB of storage and there’s no room for a MicroSD card to expand it. When you consider Google is also no longer offering free, unlimited backup of full-resolution photos, 64GB feels a little stingy.The new Google Assistant is faster. It can listen for follow-up questions or comments and understand context to provide you with the info you want. It doesn’t just open apps at your command, it can jump right to the Twitter profile you’re looking for. It is baked into more and more of Google’s services, from Maps to Gmail, and if you use these services on a daily basis, and you’re comfortable throwing tasks at Google Assistant, you really owe it to yourself to check out the Pixel 4.This is where voice assistants are going. This is a big step closer to that hands-free future, where a disembodied digital servant lives in all our devices waiting to meet our every whim, or at least turn the lights off and play our favorite movie on the TV. How far you can take this right now depends on how smart your home is, and I’m sure Google will find a way to roll a lot of these capabilities out to other phones, but for now, it makes the Pixel 4 special.The Pixel 4 is missing that extra ultra-wide-angle option, which can be great in situations when you want to cram more in, but what is here works beautifully.That’s not the only unique bit of software trickery you’ll find. Favorite features like Now Playing, which tells you what song is playing wherever you are and compiles a list you can go back and check (all done locally on your Pixel 4) is still there, as is Call Screen, which filters spam calls if you’re in the U.S. or Canada. Google has new tricks, too. There’s live captioning on the Pixel 4 without the need for an internet connection, based on the same technology that enables the new version of Google Assistant.That means you can play any audio — a movie, a podcast, or even a call you recorded, and your Pixel 4 will transcribe it live, throwing up accurate captions on the screen. This automatic speech recognition is also embedded in the new Recorder app, which is a journalist’s dream because it automatically transcribes interviews or anything else you care to record. It’s impressively accurate. When I speak in my business voice, the same voice I use to speak colleagues in the states, it is word perfect. If I dial up the Scottish accent, it struggles a wee bit, but it’s impossible not to be impressed by this feature and I’m likely to use it daily.The Pixel 4 has a serious stamina problem. Last year, I described the Pixel 3’s battery life as its Achilles’ heel. Although it improved a little through software updates, it has consistently given me battery anxiety. The Pixel 3 had a 2,915mAh capacity. The Pixel 4 has a 2,800mAh battery in it, despite the fact it has a bigger screen that runs at 90Hz and a radar system that’s constantly vigilant for your movements.Why Google? What are you thinking? How can a smaller battery possibly be enough to power this phone?On a busy day, my Pixel 4 had to be plugged in well before bedtime. On an average day, it made it through, but only just. Snatching off the Pixel Stand at around 8 a.m. I read some news and checked some emails. By 10 a.m. it was down to 83%. I downloaded an app, chatted on Slack a little, but mostly set it aside to work on my desktop and at 12.47 p.m. it hit 68%. I spent a while testing the Motion Sense with alarms and music, and the Pixel 4 hit 43% at 2.30 p.m. Back to work on the desktop for a while, played a quick game before dinner at 6 p.m. and it was on 24%. There were a couple of calls and some web browsing in the evening, and it was down to 10% by 10 p.m.Your mileage is going to vary depending on how you use your phone, but there’s no hiding the fact that the Pixel 4 has disappointing battery life. On a day out with navigation and loads of photos, my Pixel 4 was hitting 40% in the early afternoon. That’s just not good enough.In our YouTube streaming video test the Pixel 4 managed 7 hours and 40 minutes. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S10 managed 10 hours and 50 minutes, the iPhone 11 Pro went for 12 hours, but the iPhone 11 only managed 4 hours and 54 minutes. Last year’s Pixel 3 was marginally worse on 7 hours and 21 minutes, but annoyingly the more affordable Pixel 3a went 9 hours and 12 minutes. Google should have put a bigger battery in the Pixel 4 — it’s that simple.Why Google? What are you thinking? How can a smaller battery possibly be enough to power this phone?Charging speeds aren’t great either. Google stuck with Power Delivery 2.0 at 18W, so the Pixel 4 takes well over an hour to fully charge, though you can get a useful amount of power in half an hour and it will generally hit 75% within 45 minutes. It does also support Qi wireless charging and it’s worth getting the Pixel Stand for extra functionality — it will show a photo slide show if it’s still light, switch to clock mode if it isn’t, and there are a few settings you can tweak.The Google Pixel 4 starts from $799 for the 64GB model and costs $899 for the 128GB model. You can buy it unlocked and ready to go on any carrier directly from Google. You can also get one from Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or any other major carrier.Google offers a standard one-year warranty for its phones, which protects from manufacturer defects.The Google Pixel 4 is an outstanding Android phone that’s hobbled in its bid for best smartphone status by a battery that’s simply too small. The question is: are some snazzy new software features and a wonderful camera enough to persuade you to accept battery anxiety?Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro is the most complete smartphone available right now, though it starts from $999. You may also look at the iPhone 11, which is $100 less than the Pixel 4, but matches it in many categories (except it has better battery life).If you crave what Google has to offer, then the obvious alternative is the Pixel 4 XL, which has a slightly bigger screen and better battery life (not that much better) for an extra $100.If you want beautiful design and software can take a back seat, then Samsung’s wares should be in your sights. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus is an excellent smartphone in every way, though it may be overkill for some and it’s a lot more expensive at $1,100. You may consider the Galaxy S10e as a similarly-sized and priced alternative to the Pixel 4, but it’s not as pretty as its bigger siblings.The OnePlus 7T might be the best alternative, as it’s $200 cheaper than the Pixel 4, but also boasts a 90Hz screen, a capable camera, and top notch performance — it has good battery life, too.Take care of it and the Pixel 4 should serve you well for at least three years. There’s an IP68 water-resistance rating, protecting it from rain and accidental dips in the pool; it is covered in glass, though, so you may want to buy a case.Yes. If you prize the software experience above all else, and you crave that awesome camera, the Pixel 4 deserves a place in your pocket."

Check out our favorite Black Friday smartphone deals.Samsung is best known for its Galaxy S and Note phones, but the company has a long history of selling budget phones under the Galaxy J and A brand. Sold with forgettable names like Galaxy J7 Prime and J7 Core, the internal specs often changed depending on where you bought them.The latest Galaxy A-range is Samsung’s effort to streamline its budget and mid-tier lineup, and the face of the series is the Galaxy A50. Buy the Galaxy A50 from Sprint? It’s the same exact phone as the Galaxy A50 on Verizon.At $350, it’s a great phone that delivers all-day battery life, a modern screen, solid performance, and a good camera. But its price puts it right next to our current budget champion, the $400 Pixel 3a. Can the Samsung phone pose a challenge to Google’s budget masterpiece?Looking for a great phone this Black Friday? Check out our favorite Black Friday smartphone deals.Expensive phones have large screens, slim bezels, and clever ways to place the selfie camera on the front — like the hole-punch camera on Samsung’s Galaxy S10 range, or the pop-up camera on the OnePlus 7 Pro. Budget phones have quickly mimicked this design, and the Galaxy A50 is no different. On the front, you get a slim bezel around the screen. The bezel is most noticeable at the bottom, also known as “a chin,” and there’s a teardrop notch at the top housing the selfie camera.The A50 looks contemporary. The same can’t be said for the Pixel 3a, which suffers the plague of thick bezels. Around back, the A50 looks much like the iPhone XS, with a vertical camera setup in the top left corner. Ours came in glossy black, which showed rainbow-like effects when light caught the back. It’s nice, but we’d like to see brighter color options, as well.The rear is made of plastic that looks like glass but feels cheap to the touch. The A50 is slippery, too. It’s not going to slide off a table, but it can feel hard to grip. It’s a large phone, with a 6.4-inch screen, so users with small hands may find it difficult to use comfortably.I’m happy with the button placement — the power and volume rocker are on the right edge and are easily accessible. There’s a USB Type-C charging port at the bottom edge, next to a headphone jack, and a bottom-firing speaker.The rear of the A50 is a bit dull. I think the Pixel 3a is more attractive. The A50 also doesn’t feel substantial in-hand like the similarly-priced Nokia 7.1, which uses a mixture of aluminum and glass. Still, it gets the job done, and the bezel-less screen is the real treat.The 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen on the Galaxy A50 serves up 2,340 x 1,080 resolution, which is similar to the Pixel 3a’s 2,280 x 1,080 resolution. It doesn’t beat the contrast ratio of the Pixel 3a’s screen, which offers slightly darker colors, but the A50’s screen looks sharp and it’s plenty bright.You’ll be more than satisfied with the viewing experience on either phone. The Pixel 3a has a Samsung-made screen, after all. However, the A50 earns a bonus point because videos, movies, and games look more immersive thanks to its bezel-less design.Does audio quality help immersion? Not exactly. There’s a single bottom-firing speaker, and while it can get loud, it sounds muffled. It can be difficult to hear audio when outdoors in noisy environments, even with the volume cranked to the max. The Pixel 3a’s stereo speakers are better, delivering richer quality, though volume is comparable.The A50 has a headphone jack (as does the Pixel 3a), so you can plug in if you don’t have wireless earbuds. The phone also supports Dolby Atmos, and music sounds better listening in with Samsung’s own Galaxy Buds.Samsung’s in-display fingerprint sensor is a pain point. The A50 places it under the front screen glass, and like most under-glass sensors, it’s unreliable. You can use a face unlock option, but it’s not quick, and its implementation here isn’t secure.Unlike most Android phones in the U.S., Samsung’s Galaxy A50 isn’t powered by a Qualcomm processor. Instead, Samsung uses its own Exynos 9610 with 4GB of RAM. There’s 64GB of internal storage, and a MicroSD card slot in case you need more space.The A50’s performance is acceptable, but Google’s Pixel 3a is quicker overall. Google’s phone is faster when opening apps and didn’t show many struggles when switching between them. The Pixel 3a also feels more fluid, while the A50 few stutters here and there. Take Google Maps, for example. Moving around the map is smooth on the Pixel phone, but you can see occasional lag on the A50.Here are a few benchmark results:The benchmark back this up. The Pixel 3a beat out the A50 in AnTuTu and 3DMark tests, though the A50 pulled ahead in Geekbench results.Still, the Galaxy A50 is a perfectly capable phone. It didn’t have any trouble with apps, and while performance isn’t the smoothest, it never failed me. Even gaming is possible. In PUBG: Mobile, the game automatically opted for the highest graphical settings possible, and I didn’t run into any hitches while playing (though the phone felt warm to the touch). I also saw solid performance in Alto’s Odyssey and Pako: Forever.Overall, the A50 is easily better than the Nokia 7.1, but a hair behind the Pixel 3a.I reviewed the Verizon Galaxy A50, which is pre-installed with many apps and games. Thankfully, I was able to uninstall most of the bloatware.The phone runs Samsung’s One UI interface, which is laid over Android 9 Pie. It looks slick, though I wish the icons weren’t so large. It’s among the better manufacturer skins on a phone.However, software Google’s Pixel 3a has the edge. The Pixel has smarter features in software, like Call Screen, which protects you from robocalls, and Now Playing, which detects and displays music playing in your surroundings.Software updates are a concern, too. Samsung is notoriously slow to deliver Android version. It took the Galaxy S9 series close to six months to get Android 9 Pie on all devices in the U.S. On a more positive note, Samsung is following through with monthly security updates for several devices.Google’s phones promise three years of security and version updates. That means you can expect the Pixel 3a to run Android S in 2021. Updates are important. They don’t just bring new features, though they are very much appreciated; security updates can keep your device protected and secure.Samsung confirmed to Digital Trends that the Galaxy A50 will receive quarterly security updates, with unspecified “plans for an OS update.” Expect to receive Android Q, and not much else. That’s disappointing, though much better than what budget phones received a few years ago.The Samsung Galaxy A50 has a triple-camera system on the rear. That includes a 25-megapixel main lens (f/1.7 aperture), a 5-megapixel depth camera (f/2.2), and an 8-megapixel wide-angle lens (f/2.2).The camera app can be slow to launch, and the shutter can lag at times, but photo quality is good. The HDR surprised me the most and makes the A50 adept at handling high-contrast scenarios. There’s a good amount of detail, colors look vibrant, and the wide-angle lens allows for creativity.It’s not without flaws. The camera can struggle with fast-moving objects, and since there’s no optical image stabilization, you need to stay as still as possible when taking a photo. The A50 performs well in low-light situations, but can’t match the Pixel 3a and its A.I.-assisted Night Sight mode.The wide-angle camera’s photos are extremely distorted, which is fine if that’s the look you’re going for. It does make the A50 more versatile than your typical budget phone. The wide-angle lens has trouble in dark situations, however.You can’t use the third camera. It’s not a telephoto lens, but a depth camera, and it only works during portrait mode (Samsung calls it Live Focus). It adds bokeh around a subject, and the photos are strong when there’s good lighting.I compared the Galaxy A50 to the Pixel 3a, as you can see in the photos above, and preferred the Pixel 3a. Samsung’s HDR can be too aggressive, which results in strangely morphed colors, like the image of the birdhouse. It doesn’t handle low light well, blowing out the image and compromising image quality. The Pixel 3a handles dark settings well even without the Night Sight feature turned on.The A50’s Live Focus shot of my dog is great, but Google’s phone has better colors, is more detailed, and the bokeh effect isn’t as exaggerated. The Pixel 3a slightly stumbles on deciding where to apply bokeh, but it’s still the better photo.There’s a 25-megapixel camera (f/2.0) on A50’s front, and it can take decent selfies, even with Live Focus mode. Don’t expect the same amount of detail you get in selfies from the Pixel 3a, though.The A50 has a surprisingly strong camera system, especially for its $350 price tag. However, the Pixel 3a elevates the camera experience. If the camera is your favorite feature on a phone, you’ll want to opt for the Pixel 3a.There’s a massive 4,000mAh battery in the Galaxy A50. As expected, it lasts a full day of heavy use, and not a single minute more. After a day of messaging, music streaming, gaming, and capturing photos, the phone hit 15 percent close to midnight.When I didn’t use the phone as heavily, I often arrived home at 6 p.m. with 40 percent charge remaining, if not a little more. With light usage, there’s a chance you can stretch battery life to a little under two days. Battery anxiety isn’t an issue here.Our battery test proves that too. I played a 1080p YouTube video over Wi-Fi with the brightness cranked to the max, and the Galaxy A50 lasted 10 hours and 56 minutes. That’s almost two hours more than the Pixel 3a, minutes behind the Pixel 3a XL, and it just barely bested the $900 Samsung Galaxy S10. Impressive.Charging it up is a quick endeavor thanks to the USB Type-C port. Sadly, there’s no wireless charging for added convenience, but most phones in this price range don’t have that feature.The Samsung Galaxy A50 is $350 and available from Verizon, Sprint, and Xfinity Mobile. You can buy it unlocked starting September 20 from Best Buy, Amazon, and Samsung.com. Pre-ordering from Samsung can net you up to $300 off with a qualifying trade-in.Samsung offers a standard limited warranty, which protects the phone from manufacturer defects for one year from the date of purchase.The Galaxy A50 shows Samsung can make excellent phones, no matter the cost. Competition in this price range is stiff, though, and there are a few areas where Google’s Pixel 3a still pulls ahead.Yes. The Google Pixel 3a or 3a XL. Both are a little more expensive, but not by much. They match the A50 in several categories such as screen, battery life, and performance — pulling ahead in some — but they have better cameras, and significantly better software support.Spend $150 more, and you can get the spectacular Asus ZenFone 6, which grants you the same high-end processor inside the Galaxy S10 — so you get superior performance — as well as a massive 5,000mAh battery. Or consider the ZTE Axon 10, another mid-range phone with even better hardware.Want an iPhone? The least expensive new choice is Apple’s iPhone 8, which retails for $450. It’s still a solid phone, but the design is dated next to the Samsung Galaxy A50.Check out our best cheap phones guide for more.The Galaxy A50 has no water resistance, so it won’t play well with water. Thankfully, it’s not made of glass, so you don’t need to worry about shattering both sides of the phone (just one).This phone will likely last you two years, if not three, before the battery begins to deteriorate. You can only expect one year of version updates from Samsung, however, so the phone’s elder years will be spent running an outdated version of Android.Yes. We particularly like the unlocked version available for under $300 on Amazon already. It’s a great value, and currently available for as little as $230 on sale. That’s tough to beat."
71,Samsung Galaxy A51,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-a51-review/,"Flagship phones are getting more expensive. While there was once a time when you could get the best of the best for $600 to $700, these days you’ll have to shell out at least $900. The result? Midrange phones have to get better too — and that’s where the Samsung Galaxy A51 comes in to contend for the best Android phones out.The device is a follow-up to last year’s Samsung Galaxy A50. It offers a modern design and a few high-end features, while sacrificing things like top performance and a few camera features. But at $400, the phone has a lot of competition. And it’s some serious competition — like the new iPhone SE, which many consider to currently be the best phone under $400.Is the Samsung Galaxy A51 one of the best cheap phones available? Let’s take a closer look.The Galaxy A series has long been about offering premium features in an under-powered and inexpensive package — and those premium features usually include a modern design. That remains true here, and that’s one of the main ways in which the phone is better than the iPhone SE, which shares an aging design with the iPhone 8.On the front of the phone, you’ll get an edge-to-edge display, with a hole-punch cutout in the middle for the front-facing camera. The modern design trends continue to the back, with the rectangular camera bump on the top left — similar to that of the Galaxy S20 series. The camera bump doesn’t protrude much from the back of the phone at all, which helps ensure that it doesn’t wobble too much on the desk. It’s a nice touch, and I hope manufacturers continue to move more toward flush cameras again.On the left side there’s the SIM tray, while on the right, there’s a power button and volume rocker. On the bottom, there’s a USB-C port, and yes, a headphone jack — making this an enticing option for the audiophile out there.The edge-to-edge display helps ensure that the phone feels comfortable in the hand and is easy to pocket. While there’s a fairly large 6.5-inch display here — 6.24 x 2.90 x 0.31 inches — most people won’t find it too big for day-to-day use. Sure, it’s bigger than the iPhone SE, but at the same time, the iPhone SE is equipped with only a 4.7-inch display. It’s also bigger than the Google Pixel 3a — but again, the Pixel 3a retains a dated design with a large forehead and chin.Sure, it’s not as premium as the $1,000+ Galaxy S20 series, and the back of this phone is plastic instead of glass, but it shares many of the same design elements, and despite the plastic, it doesn’t necessarily feel cheap. It comes in a few colors, including silver, black, and blue, and while they all look fine, I particularly like the colorful blue model.As mentioned, the display on the Samsung Galaxy A51 is 6.5 inches, and the quality of it is better than average for a phone in this price range. There’s more than enough display here for most, and only the most avid pixel peepers will have a problem with it.The resolution on the display is 1,080 x 2,400, but perhaps more importantly, it’s an AMOLED display — which makes for deep black levels and vivid colors. That puts the phone’s ahead of the iPhone SE, considering Apple’s reluctance to adopt OLED technology in anything but its most expensive and recent models. It also gives the device a leg up against the Moto G Stylus, which matches the resolution, but features LCD technology.It’s nice to see better display tech bleeding into cheaper phones. In the coming year or two, we should start seeing less expensive phones with 1,440p resolutions too — but in my experience, having an AMOLED display makes more of a difference than a higher resolution.Under the display, there’s an optical fingerprint sensor. The sensor works fine, and recognized my print the majority of the time. It was a little slow, and that can get annoying, but it’s rarely a real annoyance.The Galaxy A51 may have an overall design similar to that of more expensive phones, but performance is one of the trade-offs. And unfortunately, it’s a relatively major one here.Under the hood, you’ll get a Samsung Exynos 9611 processor, coupled with either 4GB, 6GB, or 8GB of RAM, depending on the model you go for. I’m reviewing the 4GB model.It’s a bit of a bummer that Samsung didn’t include a more powerful chipset. While the Exynos 9611 is marketed as a new chip, it’s really just a recycled Exynos 9610 that enables the 48-megapixel main camera sensor. The Exynos 9610 was featured in last year’s Galaxy A50, and at the time it was already a little under-powered. In a world with the A13-equipped iPhone SE, and even the Snapdragon 670-equipped Google Pixel 3a, the Galaxy A51 is downright slow.That translates to day-to-day use. The phone often skipped a beat or two when performing basic tasks, and animations weren’t as smooth as they could have been as a result. Mobile gaming offered similar results, with dropped frames and slow load times on a regular basis.Benchmarks confirm the lackluster performance.GeekBench 5: 315 single-core, 1,281 multi-coreIt’s unfortunate for Samsung that Apple launched the iPhone SE, which absolutely dominates against the Galaxy A51 in benchmarks and daily use. The fact is that users are beginning to expect better performance from lower-end phones, and the Galaxy A51 doesn’t deliver.Samsung’s One UI has been getting better over the years, and it’s leagues better than the old days of TouchWiz and Samsung Experience — but it’s still pretty far from stock Android. If you’re looking for a stock experience, then you’ll want to check out the Pixel 3a instead.That said, One UI has its own aesthetic, and some like it. I personally prefer the cleaner look and feel of stock Android, but thankfully Samsung doesn’t stray too far into bloatware territory, like LG UX.In this phone, you’ll get the second iteration of One UI, One UI 2.0, which is laid over Android 10. It looks fine and is easy to get used to if you’re coming from a different manufacturer.As is the case with other Samsung phones, the Galaxy A51 probably won’t get speedy software updates. The flagship Galaxy S series is slow enough to get updates, and it’s a priority for Samsung. You’ll likely get an update or two on the A51, but don’t expect them to be timely. You’ll have to deal with Bixby on the Galaxy A51, as there’s no native way to remap the Bixby shortcut to another assistant.Flagship phones are pushing the boundaries of what we thought we could get in a smartphone camera, thanks largely to machine learning and the use of multiple lenses. The Samsung Galaxy A51 jumps aboard the multiple lens train too, with a quad-lens camera. You’ll get a 48-megapixel main sensor, along with a 12-megapixel ultrawide sensor, a 5-megapixel macro sensor, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor.Of course, the number of sensors and megapixels doesn’t ultimately dictate the quality of photos, but in the right situation, photos are pretty good. The phone does have some competition in the camera department.The iPhone SE takes advantage of Apple’s A13 processor for better image processing and ultimately good photos, while the Google Pixel 3a has the same quality of images that the Pixel series has become known for, which puts the Pixel series at the front of the camera-quality pack.As for the A51, with the 48-megapixel main sensor, and in well-lit environments, photos look great. You’ll get a good amount of detail, and while photos aren’t as deep as those taken with the iPhone 11 Pro and Pixel 4, they’re still vivid. The ultra-wide lens here is a big deal too — it makes for much better landscape shots, and a generally more versatile camera experience.Get rid of the good lighting, however, and you’re out of luck. The Galaxy A51 just can’t compete with Apple and Google’s machine learning prowess. The Google Pixel 3a still takes excellent photos in low light, though the iPhone SE is lacking here a little here too.There’s also a macro lens here, but it doesn’t have its own autofocus. You can achieve some good results with some work, but it seems like a feature that most people won’t use.The trade-off of lower-performance chipsets and lower-resolution displays is usually a longer battery life. Combined that with the fact that the Galaxy A51 already has a 4,000mAh battery, you’ll get over a day of even relatively heavy use. I was easily able to get through part of the next day too, and I suspect most people will have a similar experience.Unlike some other phones in this price range, the Samsung Galaxy A51 does not offer wireless charging. It does have 15-watt fast-charging, which is on the slow side for that tech.The Samsung Galaxy A51 costs $400 which, as mentioned, puts it in the same price range as the likes of the iPhone SE, Google Pixel 3a, and Motorola Moto G Stylus. The device is available through the Samsung website, as well as Verizon and Sprint. Verizon is actually offering the phone for $10 per month for 24 months, bringing the total down to only $240.The warranty on the phone is a pretty standard 1-year deal for manufacturer defects — so don’t expect to return the phone if you drop it and the screen cracks. If you’re hoping for a discount, take a look at the best smartphone deals and best Samsung Galaxy deals available today.The Samsung Galaxy A51 is a solid phone, but it’s up against some even more solid competition. That, however, doesn’t make this a bad option. With a great display, modern design, and decent camera performance in the right conditions, the Galaxy A51 does have a lot to offer.It’s worth noting that while the Galaxy A51 has an official MSRP of $399, it can be found for less at online retailers. It becomes a more attractive option if you can pick it up for less than $300, which is sometimes possible.The Galaxy A51 may have a lot to offer, but others offer more. If you’re willing to switch to iOS, the iPhone SE offers much better performance. That’s the best option for most. If you want to stick in the Android ecosystem, then I recommend going for the OnePlus Nord or Google Pixel 3a or better yet, waiting for the Pixel 4a.The Galaxy A51 should last for two years, but it will likely feel slow toward the end of that tenure. It doesn’t have an official IP rating, so if you drop it in water, you may be out of luck. Thanks to the plastic backing, if you drop it at the right angle, it should survive — but drop it on the screen, and you may get some cracks, as true with any modern smartphone.No. Apple’s iPhone SE and Google’s Pixel 3a remain better options."
72,Samsung Galaxy A71,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/dtdeals/samsung-galaxy-a71-deal-amazon-cyber-monday-2020/,"Now that Black Friday has come and gone, the Cyber Monday deals are finally starting to roll in. Amazon’s sale has already kicked into high gear, with lots of popular products being marked down to their lowest prices yet. One of the best offers right now is the Samsung Galaxy A71 Smartphone, available on Amazon for just $478 — more than $100 discount.The premium smartphone’s most recent model, the Samsung Galaxy A71 is one of the most quality, reliable, and — most importantly — affordable 5G phones on the market today.

73,Samsung Galaxy Fold,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-fold-review/,"Closing the Galaxy Fold is still satisfying, even after waiting five months for Samsung to fix its first foldable phone. Opening it up is still wondrous because having a large screen that I can fold up and fit in a pocket doesn’t get old.But the Galaxy Fold is $1,980, it doesn’t radically change my life, and there’s a decent chance it won’t survive two years of use unscathed. The phone a big step for the future of smartphones, but it’s also a prototype that’s for early adopters only.But first, what exactly happened to cause the delay? In April, ahead of the Fold’s initial launch, a handful of reviewers encountered issues with the display on their Galaxy Fold units, which forced Samsung to delay the release.The company recalled all units, and we didn’t hear anything else about the Fold until late July, when Samsung said it had fixed the issues and that the phone would be available in September.Here are the exact hardware changes to the Fold:There’s also now a Premier Service for people who buy the Fold, which provides access to Samsung technicians 24/7 for any issues.The Galaxy Fold doesn’t feel like a fragile phone, but Samsung goes out of its way to explain that it is using new materials and that you should treat it differently than you would a normal smartphone. Already, another reviewer has a damaged screen, though this could simply have been a defective unit. I have never had any problems with my unit — the original and the new one — but the point is that this is a new type of product and there are still kinks to work out with both the hardware and software. It’s why I can’t recommend anyone shell out for this phone. Wait for the second or third generation, where, hopefully, the price will come down, and the hardware and software will be far more refined.Now, onto what you want to hear about: Using the Galaxy Fold is quite unlike anything else. There are two screens; the first is what you see when you hold the phone folded up. It’s a small, 4.6-inch Super AMOLED HD screen (1,680 × 720), and it’s surrounded by thick bezels that make it look like it’s from 2008. Open the Fold up like a book, however, and you’re greeted to a sprawling 7.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen with a QXGA+ resolution (2,152 × 1,536).The 7.3-inch screen steals the show. Samsung calls it an Infinity Flex display, and it’s made from bonded layers of polymer material rather than glass. It doesn’t feel as smooth as glass, nor does it look as nice, but it’s what helps make the foldable phone, well, fold. Opening it is easy once you get a good grip on the edges, but snapping it shut is so much more satisfying — like hanging up a call on a flip phone.When folded, the Fold more or less takes up the same length as the Galaxy S10 Plus. The thickness, however, is what’s noticeable, as it’s the equivalent of two phones stacked on top of each other. I stopped thinking about thickness after my first few days of using it when I found the Fold fit in all my pants pockets without fail. This will be a problem for those with small pockets.You’ll also notice how narrow the phone is when it’s closed. It’s easy to wrap your hand around, but this is a different story unfolded. When it’s open like a book, the Fold is lightweight enough to manage, but most interactions will require both hands. One nice change is the Android navigation buttons can be moved to stay on the left, center, or right, so it’s a good idea to choose a placement based on your dominant hand.The right edge houses the power button and volume rocker, as well as a fingerprint scanner not unlike the one on the Galaxy S10e. The power button doubles as the Bixby button when you press and hold on it, calling up Samsung’s virtual assistant, but you can change it to pull up the power menu in Settings.There’s no fancy in-display fingerprint sensor like on the Note 10 Plus, and I don’t miss it, but the sensor is still a bit too low for my taste. I’ve instead been using the basic face unlock using the selfie camera, but it’s not secure like Apple’s Face ID. There’s no headphone jack — just like the Galaxy Note 10 range — but you do get Samsung’s Galaxy Buds in the box, and they’re great.The phone is not IP rated for dust- and water-resistance, making it the only flagship Samsung phone without the rating. It plays into the idea that you should treat this phone differently than your typical smartphone; after all, you are paying a fortune for it. My big concern is scratches or dents on the polymer screen, as one reviewer has already seen on his new Fold. The larger screen is more prone to damage because the material isn’t as hard. My unit doesn’t have any scratches or dents yet.The 7.3-inch screen steals the show. It’s made from bonded layers of polymer material rather than glass.When I first opened the Fold, both sides surrounding the hinge remained as flat as a pancake. After using it for a few days, the phone no longer sits truly flat. The edges slightly stick up, especially when held in the hand. The Fold itself doesn’t feel as stiff as it did right out of the box. I can now feel and hear sounds of the parts shifting and rubbing each other while holding the Fold unfolded. It does make me wonder how the Fold will feel after a year of use, but time will tell.Yes, it doesn’t feel fragile and looks like a brick, but I do think a single drop or two onto asphalt could take the device out of commission. If it’s any comfort, a case is included, one that’s made up of a Kevlar-like material. It feels soft, and putting it on means you won’t have to deal with ugly fingerprints back and front, but it won’t offer much protection from a drop.The 7.3-inch screen is beautiful, colorful, and sharp. It’s bright enough to see the screen in direct sunlight, but you need to angle it a certain way because it attracts a lot of glare due to the polymer material used in the display, which looks laminated. This isn’t as much of a problem indoors, but I did find myself adjusting the way I held the Fold outside.The 4.6-inch screen on the front looks even better, but it’s tougher to judge because it’s small. I often didn’t spend time using it because it’s so tiny. Content looks squished, and typing on it is a nightmare, so I often just opened the phone up. Samsung said the front screen is mostly for notifications, and that’s how I’ve been using it.Can you see a crease where the phone folds? Yes, there is a crease and, yes, it’s obvious. The crease is visible when looking at the phone from the side, or when outdoors. It’s tougher to see when looking at the phone straight on — particularly in bright and colorful apps. You can also feel it as you slide your finger across the 7.3-inch screen. I got used to it, but I can’t say it’s particularly attractive. It’s also a bit distracting when watching videos.Samsung’s One UI software, running Android 9 Pie, packs a few surprises. As mentioned, I only used the 4.6-inch screen to clear away notifications, to check the time, or to ask Google Assistant a question. For everything else, even walking in the bustling streets of New York City, I opened up the phone to use the 7.3-inch screen. It felt akin to holding a Kindle. People with large hands (like me) won’t have much trouble, but if your hands are on the smaller side, you’ll find it unwieldy.Speaking of Kindles, the Galaxy Fold completely replaced my e-book reader. It’s almost the same size as the Kindle, and reading with the Amazon Kindle app is phenomenal on the 7.3-inch screen. I can even close the phone like a book when I’m done. It’s hands down my favorite use for the larger screen.Games like Pako Forever and Alto’s Odyssey look great. Movies and videos are more immersive than on traditional phones, and every app is supersized. Optimized apps like Google Maps, Gmail, and Google Calendar take it all a step further, making use of the extra space well.Not all apps are created equal, however. Instagram looks ridiculously large, as you still only see one post at a time, and Twitter could be refined. As time passes and more foldable phones are released on the market (and prove popular), expect app developers to tinker with their apps to make better use of these larger screens.Multitasking is great, though triggering it isn’t as fluid or seamless as multitasking on an iPad with iPadOS.One of the best features is App Continuity, which Samsung worked on with Google. It makes any app you were using on the 4.6-inch screen automatically open on the 7.3-inch screen when it’s unfolded. It’s seamless, and the contents of the app remain unchanged. You can also (optionally) use the feature in reverse. I’ve used reverse App Continuity to move apps like Google Maps to the 4.6-inch front screen after closing the Fold so I could continue looking at directions. It’s excellent.Multitasking is great, though triggering it isn’t as fluid or seamless as multitasking on an iPad with iPadOS. Samsung has added a floating window you can pull out from the right side of the phone. Tap on apps in this panel and they will open up in multitasking mode — you can open up to three apps for the ultimate experience, but two of the apps are perhaps a little too squished to really be utilized well. It’s much better using two apps in split-screen mode, as it feels like you’re holding two phones next to each other.Not all apps will work in this mode, however; Facebook Messenger, for example, simply won’t open in split-screen, which is a bummer. Samsung hopes developers will add support as the foldable phone category expands.Here’s an excellent use case for all of you wondering why you’d want such a big screen. I got an email asking to reschedule a meeting, so without closing my email app, I pulled out the multitasking tray, opened Slack to connect with a colleague attending a meeting with me, and also opened my calendar app to check my schedule. I was able to check my schedule, message my colleague, and still have the email open to reference the potential new meeting times without having to switch back and forth between apps. This is the best part of the Galaxy Fold, but I still think Samsung and Google could do a bit more work on optimizing the split-screen mechanics; they don’t feel as fun or smooth as iPadOS.The Fold, like its Galaxy S10 siblings, is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor. It’s the flagship chipset of choice this year, and a handful of other Android phones use it already. It’s paired with a staggering 12GB of RAM, as well as 512GB of internal storage. There’s no MicroSD card slot so you can’t expand storage, but it’s unlikely you’ll need much more.I’d usually say 12GB of RAM is overkill, but considering this may be one of the few smartphones you’ll be using to multitask with other apps open, it’s a little more warranted on this device than any other. I haven’t run into any issues with performance on the Galaxy Fold. Multitasking poses no problem, and games like Pako Forever, Alto’s Odyssey, and PUBG: Mobile run well on the 7.3-inch screen.Here are a few benchmark results:These scores are good, but they have been eclipsed by devices like the new iPhone 11 range, the OnePlus 7T, and the Asus ROG Phone 2. Nevertheless, the Galaxy Fold doesn’t disappoint. You’ll have no issues running the apps you want to use.The camera experience on the Galaxy Fold is similar to what we’ve seen on the Galaxy S10 Plus, but with more cameras — six to be specific. There’s a 10-megapixel lens on the front, as well as a 10-megapixel lens paired with an 8-megapixel 3D depth sensor on the front when the screen is unfolded. On the rear, you’ll find a 16-megapixel ultrawide lens, a 12-megapixel standard lens (with variable aperture), and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens. It’s the extra 10-megapixel lens on the front that is the new addition, and the only difference between the Fold’s cameras and the S10 Plus’ setup.The Fold is quick to take pictures, which are colorful and detailed in good lighting conditions, and there’s solid HDR, so images never look too underexposed or overexposed. The triple camera setup on the rear makes it a versatile system, as you can zoom in or go ultrawide for the perfect shot. These two cameras falter in low light, though, as details are often muddy. The main standard camera, which can switch to a wider aperture at night, fares better, but it’s not as strong as the nighttime shots we’ve seen come out of the iPhone 11, Huawei P30 Pro, or Google Pixel 3.Live Focus, Samsung’s portrait mode that adds a blur effect behind a subject, works best in broad daylight. It doesn’t do the best job outlining the subject and details aren’t as strong, but when it works, the result is solid.On top of all this, you can capture 4K HDR video, which offers a cinematic and colorful look to your videos, and there’s a Super Steady mode that sacrifices some image quality for smooth shots.The 10-megapixel cameras — above the unfolded and folded front screens — take average selfies. Detail is often lacking when compared to selfies from the iPhone 11 or Pixel 3, and I’ve often run into overexposed backgrounds. You’ll want to use the selfie camera on the inner screen — the one with the extra depth-sensing camera — as Live Focus selfies are a little better. There’s better accuracy with the blur, and photos are generally more vibrant. These selfie cameras can capture 4K UHD video if you plan on vlogging in high quality.It’s not the best camera system, but the six cameras on the Galaxy Fold will satisfy, and its versatility means you have more ways than one to take a photo.A large 4,380mAh capacity battery sits inside the Galaxy Fold. It’s a dual-cell battery, but all you need to know is that battery life is good. On light to medium days of use, which involved using the Fold for browsing social media, messaging, and more, I frequently ended with about 50 percent battery life around 6 p.m. Relying on it more to watch videos, play games, read via the Kindle app, and stream music strained the battery more, but the Fold still managed to get through a full day, with around 30 percent left by 7 p.m. It’s not as great as the iPhone 11 Pro Max, but it does the job.On one particular day of extensive reading, I managed to hit seven hours of screen on time, which is impressive. I average around three and a half hours of screen on time on the Google Pixel 3 XL, for example.In our battery test, where we played a 1080p YouTube video over Wi-Fi with max brightness (on the larger screen), the Galaxy Fold lasted for 14 hours and 10 minutes. Impressive. That’s our second-best score to date, still sitting just behind the Huawei P30 Pro.You can charge the Galaxy Fold wirelessly — unfolded or folded — or with a USB Type-C charging cable. While there’s support for fast charging, it’s only for Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 2.0 technology, which isn’t as fast as other Android phones that use Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 or other proprietary technology. It’s not going to charge as fast as the Note 10 Plus. Still, the phone managed to go from 5 percent to full in around two hours time.Wireless charging support means there’s also Wireless Powershare, a feature first introduced on the Galaxy S10 series. You can turn the Fold into a Qi wireless charger and charge other devices that support the standard, like the Galaxy Buds earbuds case, or even an iPhone XS. It’s best used in dire situations, as it’s slow.The Galaxy Fold is $1,980 and comes with 512GB of storage, as well as Samsung’s Galaxy Buds, which are true wireless earbuds. You can buy it unlocked from Samsung’s website and Best Buy, but the only carrier selling it is AT&T, and if you buy this mode,l just be aware that it will be locked and filled with bloatware.It comes in Cosmos Black and Space Silver. There were two other color options available before, but Samsung has decided to streamline the choices. A 5G version of the Fold is available in some markets outside the U.S.Buyers will get Samsung’s Premier Service, which offers up access to Samsung technicians 24/7. You can ask them any questions you have about the Fold, and they can help show off features of the phone, and more.You only get a standard one-year warranty, but it offers one free screen repair. After the warranty expires, you’ll get a one-time $150 screen replacement, but after that, it will cost $600. Samsung’s Premium Care extends your warranty and coverage, but it will cost you $12 a month.The Samsung Galaxy Fold might have had a turbulent launch, but it’s a strong first step for foldable phones. The $2,000 price still puts the tech out of reach for most people.There isn’t a lot of competition for the Fold if you’re looking for other foldable phones. Its biggest competitor is the Huawei Mate X, a foldable phone from the Chinese company that’s set to release this year. The Mate X is more expensive, at around $2,600, but it has a beefier battery, sleeker design, an extra screen on the back, and, more than likely, better cameras — if the Huawei P30 Pro is anything to go by. Sadly, like most Huawei phones, the Mate X won’t be sold in the U.S.Other phones, like the Motorola Razr reboot, look promising but are still in the works. It’ll be months before we see the competition hit its stride.If you just want a really good phone, Samsung’s Galaxy Note 10 Plus is a good place to start. You should also look at the Galaxy S10, and the iPhone 11 Pro range or iPhone 11. If you’re a shutterbug, it’s worth waiting for the Google Pixel 4. Check out our best smartphones guide for more.This is a tricky question to answer since the Fold is the first foldable phone from a major manufacturer, and it has already been delayed once due to display issues, and the new version has already been damaged (though it could have just been a defective unit). It should ideally last for three to four years, but the hinge mechanism could wear down, and the display could get damaged through everyday use, limiting its life span.One thing I do know is Samsung is still slow at pushing out software updates. Don’t expect to get Android 10 on the Galaxy Fold until early 2020, which is disappointing.No. The Galaxy Fold feels like the future of phones, but it’s far too expensive in the present."
74,Samsung Galaxy Note 10,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review/,"The Galaxy Note 10 Plus stole a lot of hearts at its debut, but I looked inquisitively and in admiration of the smaller Galaxy Note 10. Not just because it’s the first time Samsung has launched two Note phones, but because moving it around in my hand made it feel unlike any other device: a massive 6.3-inch screen in a one-hand-friendly form that felt like liquid and looked like it too.I’m in love with its size, and my ogling gaze made me almost miss what Samsung was telling me: This doesn’t have all the features as the Note 10 Plus. I winced as the air was knocked out of me. “OK,” I thought. “What are we missing?”After spending some time with the Note 10, the answer is not much. Note smartphones have always indulged in the excess, so what happens when you make a “lite” version? Well, you come away with a lavish, powerful phone that’s still more than what most people need, with a stylus to boot, if that’s your thing.If you’re into the bigger, more feature-packed Note 10 Plus, check out our full review. What catches the eye first with the Note 10 is undoubtedly the dazzling, color-changing colorways. All named with the befitting “Aura” prefix, the Note 10 comes in Aura Glow, Aura White, and Aura Black. Aura Glow is the model I received and probably the one you’ll want most for its beautiful rainbow-spectrum reflections. The Galaxy Note 10 makes me wish I could take pictures of my phone with my phone.The Note 10 is actually smaller than last year’s Note 9, while still maintaining almost the same large screen size — 6.3 inches compared to the Note 9’s 6.4-inch screen. This is thanks to the slimmed-down bezels around the screen, giving you more screen real estate than ever before; it has some of the slimmest bezels I’ve seen on a phone. It looks and feels smaller than the Note 9 in-hand, like a slightly wider Galaxy S10. It’s comfortable, and I never thought I’d say a Samsung Note– of all phones — is perfectly usable with just one hand.The Galaxy Note 10 makes me wish I could take pictures of my phone with my phone.For reference, the Note 10 Plus has a sprawling 6.8-inch screen but it’s almost the same footprint as the Note 9. As Samsung gets better at fitting bigger screens in smaller devices, it makes sense to make an even bigger-screened Galaxy Note 10 Plus, but creating a smaller phone is a welcome addition too.Speaking of the screen, the Note 10 differs from the Plus in screen resolution. It has a 2,280 x 1,080 resolution (401 pixels per inch). In practice, you truly won’t be able to tell a difference in sharpness without making a concerted effort. It’s still the same Dynamic AMOLED panel that’s HDR10+ certified, vivid, and gets plenty bright when you’re out and about in the sun. It’s spectacular.As you can see in the comparison above, while the red jacket on the subject wasn’t as dark as it is in the iPhone XS in real life, the Note 10’s screen is distinctly brighter.There is a casualty we should address, which Samsung said was in the name of the thinner body and big battery within — the beloved 3.5mm headphone jack. I, like many, am not stoked to need an adapter if I want to use wired headphones, but also like many, by now, I have at least one pair of Bluetooth headphones. It’s not often I need or want to go wired but the option is useful. A USB-C to 3.5mm dongle is not included in the box, sadly, just a pair of USB-C AKG earbuds.The Bixby button has also disappeared, well, sort of. Technically it’s the power button that has disappeared, and the old Bixby button is now a sleep/wake key. Press and hold the button, and it calls upon Bixby, Samsung’s voice assistant. So how do you turn the phone off? There’s a new software button in the notification drawer, or you can customize the physical sleep/wake key in the settings menu to offer up the power menu when you press and hold it, effectively disabling Bixby.The S Pen, still accessible from the bottom of the phone, has some aesthetic changes; specifically, there are beveled edges you likely won’t notice unless you’re comparing it directly to last year’s S Pen. The stylus does add some gestures to its repertoire in the form of Air Actions. Much like we saw on the recently-announced Galaxy Tab S6, you can hold the button on the S Pen and wave it like a magic wand to switch between camera modes or media within a gallery, as well as zoom the camera with a circular motion to the left or right.For the most part, these work well in practice, though it may take a few tries to get used to the gestures. Air Actions are useful for taking photos or video on a tripod setup but otherwise might not get much use in your daily life. More integrations may crop up in third-party apps, though, thanks to the open software development kit for third-party developers. At the moment, it works in Samsung’s Gallery app and YouTube.The S Pen has also become more professionally-viable with a brand-new Microsoft Office integration. Now, you can take written notes in the Samsung Notes app and transcribe them into editable text, and then export it to a Word document. Samsung’s transcription technology is fairly accurate, deciphering my awful penmanship adeptly, punctuation and all. Still, writing on a screen this size, you’re unable to fit full sentences on one line, which will create some formatting issues you’ll need to rectify when transferring to a Word document. It can be handy for shorter notes and lists, though, and it’s impressively trained on 62 languages and thousands of handwriting samples, so it should transcribe well for a good amount of people.The other downside is that the transcribed text shows up on the Word document in a text box — that means you need to cut it from the text box and then paste it inline on the document. It’s a bit clunky. Still, this is a nice step towards making the Note 10 a more universal tool for productivity, and hopefully, we’ll see more options for export with third-party apps like Google Docs.The S Pen has become more professionally viable with a brand-new Microsoft Office integration.The last new trick for the S Pen is an app called AR Doodle. It brings the S Pen’s drawing functionality to real life, transposing your doodles into real-life objects and faces with augmented reality and face-tracking technology. We’ve seen this before from apps like Google’s Just a Line app; it’s not a feature I see myself using ever but it was mildly entertaining to play around with. Facial tracking works well but things can seem to get a little off track when plotting objects around you rather than just on faces.Perhaps more appealing is a seamless solution to the long-awaited link between your phone and computer, akin to what Apple device owners enjoy with their iPhones and Macs. As I mentioned earlier, Samsung and Microsoft teamed up for some special features, and this particular one builds on Microsoft’s Your Phone app, which lets you see notifications, messages, and your recent photos on a connected Windows PC or laptop.Samsung’s two key additions are the ability to take phone calls and mirror your Note 10 on a Windows device. While the former will be enabled at a later date, the latter is live, proving to be a fun way to interact with your phone for tasks or even playing games — like a little virtual box to run Android apps. There is a slight lag in gaming but it’s still quite usable.Setup is fairly straight-forward — we have a guide you can follow. All that’s required is a sign-in to your Microsoft Account on your Note 10 and registering your linked devices — but it’s not nearly as plug-and-play as the link between iOS and MacOS, which has a secure handshake behind the scenes via your internet connection and a simple “would you like to use this feature” prompt. Samsung and Microsoft’s implementation also only allows you one device to pair with your phone, forcing you to de-register through the website if you’d like to link another laptop or PC. This is another strike against its seamlessness, as Apple devices have no limit for connections.Samsung’s DeX mode, which enables a desktop Android interface when its phones are connected to an external monitor, can now also run on Windows and Macs, simply by connecting your Note 10 via USB cable. You’ll need to download the Samsung DeX app on your computer but no data from your phone gets stored on the PC unless you move it there.Essentially, it’s a little virtual machine that pops up and runs on your computer in its own sandbox. It works as intended, and can be an easy way to transfer files, but there doesn’t appear to be much more you get out of this integration other than another screen with peripherals on which you can run DeX.There’s a good amount to like in the performance area, but some curious omissions feel like they were made for the sake of creating separation between the Note 10 and the Note 10 Plus. The Note 10, like the Note 10 Plus, is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor. Where it differs is RAM: the Note 10 has 8GB and the Note 10 Plus has 12GB. More RAM isn’t necessarily a good thing, and 8GB is plenty. Through a week of heavy and varied uses, I can’t think of a single instance where I thought, “Damn, this needs more RAM.” This will be sufficient now and likely the near future too.Here are some benchmark results:The Note 10 beat the Note 10 Plus in AnTuTu and 3DMark scores, which isn’t unusual as it doesn’t need to power as large of a screen with a high resolution. These scores are high and place the Note 10 in our list of best-performing phones, which also include the likes of the OnePlus 7 Pro and the iPhone XS.My main concern is storage. You only get 256GB for the Note 10 (Note 10 Plus buyers can choose between 256GB and 512GB), and there is no MicroSD card slot, despite there being one on the Plus model. For a $1,000 device aimed at power users and professionals, this is a tough pill to swallow. In reality, 256GB should be more than enough for most people, but I can’t help but feel like this limit was made arbitrarily.Flicking around the Android 9 Pie operating system and testing out features showed a speedy phone by all accounts. Daily tasks are handled in an instant, while multitasking and gaming showed similarly pleasing speed and fluidity. One UI, as always, is feature-packed with menus within menus within menus. I still very much appreciate Samsung’s creature comforts like a button to scroll to the top of lists, which sadly isn’t present in every app, and the smooth aesthetics of Night mode, the company’s dark user interface setting. Its ability to turn web pages black is honestly the only reason I use Samsung’s browser over Google Chrome because it looks that good.I can’t think of a single instance where I thought, ‘Damn, this needs more RAM’.What about 5G? The next-gen network technology isn’t widely available yet and will take a few years to fully develop, but If you were hoping for 5G on a Note device, you’ll have to get the Note 10 Plus 5G, specifically. It’s the same exact phone as the Galaxy Note 10 Plus, just 2 grams heavier and it can connect to 5G networks.The triple-camera setup on the rear is a first for a Note phone, following its debut on the Galaxy S10 range. Sporting similar three lenses and megapixel pairings as the S10, the Note 10 brings together a 12-megapixel main lens, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens, and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens. While the Note 10 has the same variable aperture (f/1.5 and f/2.4) on the main camera, the telephoto lens has a wider aperture than the Galaxy S10, which makes a big difference in low-light photos. There’s also now a Night Mode you can manually enable, and it also works for the 10-megapixel selfie camera, which has a narrower f/2.2 aperture over the S10.Packing top-flight camera specs, but no time-of-flight (ToF) sensor, the Note 10 still has some of the best hardware you can get in a phone camera and therefore some of the best results. Though tweaks over the Galaxy S10’s triple-camera setup are slight, they make a noticeable difference – in good ways and bad.The good comes with the telephoto lens and low-light performance. Changes to aperture make the Note 10’s telephoto lens a much better performer than the S10, especially in low-light. In such instances, the S10 couldn’t bring in enough light to illuminate the entire shot, where the Note 10 could. In fact, the Note 10, overall, picked up more color and detail in lower-light scenes than the S10, not just in night shots.The bad is that some of the time I found the S10 to be a more accurate performer in daytime and dynamic scenes. But a large part of the camera experience is the same between the two phones. Flip on the Night Mode feature on these two, and our favor again lies with the S10, which didn’t over-brighten and over-sharpen as much as the Note 10 did with Night Mode enabled. In fact, I favored the S10’s Night Mode over a few competitor’s respective night modes.So, how’s the Note 10 shape up against perennial photography powerhouses like the Pixel 3 and iPhone XS? As mentioned, the Note 10 takes good pictures when it comes to detail and the ease with which you can trigger the shutter and come away with a pleasing photo. But compared to these two, the Note 10 has a marked tendency to over-brighten, over-saturate, and over-sharpen in daytime and nighttime photos.This over-brightening contributes to overall flatter scenes on the Note 10, particularly in low-light, compared to the Pixel 3 and iPhone XS, despite the Note’s exquisite detail capture. All three capture great photos, but the iPhone’s more accurate color capture and unrivaled HDR processing most often produced the most accurate shots. The Pixel 3 comes in second behind the iPhone XS in color accuracy but also produces more pleasing contrast with its more saturated colors in certain scenes, particularly darker sunsets or similarly dynamic shots, where dialing up contrast can be favorable. The iPhone’s HDR tends to even things out more, illuminating the entire scene more adeptly than either the Note 10 or Pixel 3.In low-light, the Note 10 does show better noise reduction than both the iPhone XS and Pixel 3, but every other aspect of the photo was often too out of whack in comparison. Having a wide-angle lens is the main advantage of the Note 10 over the Pixel and iPhone, and it captures some pleasing and unique shots you just can’t get otherwise. But the next iPhone is rumored to have a wide-angle camera, so competition will just get fiercer.All in all, the Note 10 is an excellent photography tool, which captures photos as good as its competitors — but not all the time. Despite the more versatile three-camera setup, I’d personally prefer the iPhone XS or Pixel in my pocket for their better image processing, which produces more favorable shots in a wider variety of scenes.On the video side, Samsung has added its Live Focus Video mode from the S10 5G. It’s portrait mode but for video, so you get a background blur effect around subjects. But because the Note 10 doesn’t have the time-of-flight sensor on the back to capture depth information like the Note 10 Plus, blur effects can only be applied by facial recognition, and therefore can’t be used for pets or objects, unlike the Note 10 Plus. Frankly, neither is perfect and both look rather artificial and inauthentic, especially when the subject moves, but it would be nice to be able to do more than faces on the Note 10 (the video sample above is from the Note 10 Plus).The Note 10 features an audio zoom feature for videos, dubbed Zoom-In Audio. Multiple mics are used to target audio on the subject in the frame while toning down the surroundings, intensifying the focused audio the further you zoom in. It works well in my testing, successfully drowning out the background noises to the point where the subject was most distinct.Rounding out the video features are improvements to steadiness in the Steady Shot video mode as well as the addition of this feature to Hyperlapse videos. You also have a native video editor that is more powerful, as it now lets you add transitions, music, and even doodles from the S Pen to your movies. Using it is straight-forward and useful for shorter clips, but you’ll definitely want to plug into DeX or transfer the files to a computer for anything longer than a couple of minutes.The Note 10 Plus is packed with a massive 4,300mAh battery, and it still will just barely last you through a full day. I was worried when I heard the Note 10 only has a 3,500mAh battery capacity, but thankfully it’s capable of lasting a full day. You can head to bed most nights around 11 p.m. and still have 20% to 30% battery capacity remaining.We’re still running our battery test on the Note 10, but will update this story when it has concluded with the results.Even better, after years of lagging behind the competition in fast charging technology, the Note 10 finally adds a 25-watt brick in the box. However, while it charged our Note 10 Plus from zero to 100 in just an hour and two minutes, it consistently took us an hour and 30 minutes to recharge the smaller Note 10 — and we tried it through multiple outlets. It’s not as fast as we’d like, but still speedier than phones like the iPhone XS. You can’t even buy the special 45W charger for even faster charging as it only works with the Note 10 Plus, which is a shame.Wireless charging is still available, as is reverse wireless charging, which lets you recharge devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Buds or even the Galaxy Watch Active 2 by placing them on the back of the phone.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is $950, which is $150 less than the Note 10 Plus. It’s available now, and you can check out all the deals and prices from various carriers on the Note 10 and Note 10 Plus here.Samsung offers a standard limited warranty that covers manufacturer defects one year since the date of purchase.The Galaxy Note 10 is the only Note phone I’d ever use thanks to its small size. It’s fun, beautiful, fast, compact, but the only reason I still have a second phone in my pocket is because I know I can do better with the camera. Even if it is versatile, it falls a step short of the competition.For under $950, you can get the iPhone XS, Pixel 3, or even the OnePlus 7 Pro. With the iPhone XS and Pixel 3, you’ll sacrifice a wide-angle lens (and a telephoto lens on the Pixel 3, though it’s proven to be a great zoomer without it) but gain longer-term software support and quicker updates, as well as better camera performance. The iPhone XS also has more premium materials, using stainless steel instead of aluminum. The Pixel 3 has an older processor, half the RAM, and won’t look nearly as stunning with its large bezels and dated design. You may want to wait a month or so for the Pixel 4 to really step things up.The OnePlus 7 Pro has similar internals and a triple-camera setup for a few hundred dollars less, also lacking expandable storage like the Note 10, but also misses an IP water-resistance rating and wireless charging. It does have a 90Hz screen, though, which makes using it an absolute joy. Check out our guide to the best smartphones for more.Want more options? Check our list of the best smartphones sold today.The Galaxy Note 10 will last you more than three years, and after you may start to see some signs of battery degradation. The IP68 water resistance rating means it’s safe from drops in the pool, but it is wrapped in glass, so you may want to grab a case.Samsung typically supports its phones through software updates for two years, so expect to get Android 10 and Android 11, but probably not Android 12.Yes. If you’ve been dying for the S Pen experience but felt that Note devices were just too big, the Note 10 is here to save you."
75,Samsung Galaxy S10,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-review/,"Having reviewed the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, then the Galaxy S10e, and now the Galaxy S10, Samsung’s middle child in its new smartphone range doesn’t strike me as particularly notable. It has all the tenets of a good phone, yes, but it’s overshadowed by the S10 Plus (which has a few other advantages) and is just $100 more. The Galaxy S10e offers better value at $750.The two reasons you’d want the S10 over the S10 Plus involve saving just a little bit of money, or the 6.1-inch screen size is just right for you.  You’ll be getting many of the same, excellent features — from triple cameras on the rear to an almost true edge-to-edge screen experience. This is a phone that won’t disappoint.The S10’s display is gorgeous. The edges around the 6.1-inch screen are tiny, offering a stunning bezel-less experience that makes watching movies and reading on the web a joy.The bezels are razor-thin thanks to the new “hole-punch” Infinity-O display from Samsung, where a laser cuts out a small hole at the top right of the screen without damaging the pixels. This is what allows the camera to float on the display, like a hole punch in a piece of paper. I think it looks a lot better than the notch on phones like the iPhone XS, though a true full-screen experience would obviously be ideal (like on the Oppo Find X).The status bar is now a little bigger thanks to the hole-punch camera, but most apps look good in portrait orientation, and I never found the floating camera to be distracting. It’s a bit of a different story when you swap to landscape orientation, as the screen looks a little funky. Third-party apps don’t wrap around the hole-punch camera, but use a black bar that ruins the symmetry of the bezels. You end up with a thicker bezel on the side with the selfie camera in games such as Alto’s Odyssey.It’d be nice if full-screen apps adapted to make use of the screen space. YouTube, for example, lets you watch a full-screen video that goes edge-to-edge on the S10, which looks more immersive, but Netflix has yet to add support. That doesn’t work for all videos on YouTube though, as it depends on the aspect ratio the video was filmed in.The screen technology is new on the S10; Samsung calls it a “Dynamic AMOLED” display. It’s the first screen to be HDR10+ certified. I can attest that the screen is crisp, especially when you set it to the Wide QHD+ (3,040 x 1,440) resolution (it’s on Full HD+ by default). The screen is bright and easy to read in direct sunlight — just look how it eclipses the Google Pixel 3 XL in the picture above.The gorgeous screen is paired with great audio from the Dolby Atmos-supported stereo speakers. I’d have preferred to see two front-facing speakers like on the Pixel 3 or the Razer Phone 2, but the sound on the S10 is plenty loud. Oh, and whaddaya know — there’s a headphone jack too if you still want to plug in the old way.It’s not all good news, though. The S10 does have the same shortcoming I experienced with the S10 Plus. It’s easy to activate the screen accidentally or tap on random letters on the virtual keyboard when it’s open, simply by holding the phone. The skimpy bezels made it possible for my palm to constantly touch the screen. However, the issue is less frequent compared to the 6.4-inch S10 Plus.The 6.1-inch screen is not as unwieldy as the S10 Plus, but it’s not easy to hold with one hand, unlike the 5.8-inch Galaxy S10e. The difference in size may be apparent when you look at both phones, but it’s not as noticeable when they are in your hands, which is why it may make more sense to shell out an extra $100 for the S10 Plus for the extra screen real estate.I’m often ranting about how smartphones could use more color, which is why I love the varied color choices on phones like the iPhone XR. However, there’s an iridescent nature to the Prism White Galaxy S10 that’s admirable. You can also get the S10 in a Flamingo Pink, Prism Blue, and Prism Black. The latter two look good, but I’d be split between the white and the pink colors.It helps that the rear design is simplified, letting the color to make a statement. All you’ll find is a horizontal camera module, like on the Galaxy Note 9, as well as the Samsung logo. I love how the module is blacked out, which adds to the minimal look.The aluminum frame isn’t completely rounded, and there’s a flat enough edge to offer a strong grip when holding the phone — important as both the front and back are glass (Gorilla Glass 6 on the front, Gorilla Glass 5 on the back). You should get a case to protect the phone from scratches and drops. Speaking of the metal used in the body of the phone — it’d have been nice to see stainless steel here like Apple used on the iPhone XS and XS Max, which is more scratch resistant and tougher than aluminum.There’s an iridescent nature to the Prism White Galaxy S10 that has me admiring it.You may have noticed something’s missing. Yep, there’s no fingerprint sensor. On the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus, Samsung has moved the sensor under the display on the front — it’s called an embedded ultrasonic fingerprint scanner; and it captures 3D contours of thumbs and fingerprints for more secure biometric authentication. In-display fingerprint sensors aren’t new — phones like the OnePlus 6T, the Nokia 9 PureView, and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro all have them, but they use different technology.Samsung’s tech is ultrasonic, and in my experience, it’s the best in-display fingerprint scanner to date. There are machine-learning algorithms in place to prevent spoofing, and the fingerprint data never leaves the device. The sensor is certified by the FIDO Alliance (Fast Identity Online), so you can be sure it’s secure, and that also means it can be used to unlock sensitive apps — like the one for your bank — or to authenticate payments.Like the fingerprint sensor on the back of phones, you do need to precisely place your thumb or finger on the right spot — at the bottom of the S10’s screen — to unlock the phone. It takes some getting used to. Is it as quick or accurate as traditional fingerprint scanners on the back of phones? No. But it’s not far off.If you set up the face unlock option, it’s near impossible to use the fingerprint sensor because the phone unlocks so quickly. However, face unlock is not as secure — it can be triggered with just a picture of your face. You can turn off “faster recognition” for added security, but that’s still not guarantee. Apple’s Face ID is a better option.In some situations, you can see the in-display fingerprint sensor on the screen when the phone is in direct sunlight. There’s a thread about this in a Samsung community forum, and a Samsung moderator said it’s “not a defect” and you should just “lower the brightness on the screen” to avoid seeing it.The S10, like the rest of the 2019 Galaxy S10 range, is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor, which is the flagship chipset that powers most high-end Android phones this year. It’s paired with a whopping 8GB of RAM inside, along with 128GB of internal storage, though a MicroSD card slot is available in case you need to add more space.There is a distinction between the Galaxy S10e, S10 and S10 Plus when it comes to performance. Only the S10 Plus has a special vapor chamber cooling system to prevent the phone from overheating in demanding apps. You should be able to play graphically-intensive games like Fortnite or PUBG: Mobile for longer on the S10 Plus.I managed to play games like PUBG: Mobile, Alto’s Odyssey, and Breakneck without issue on the S10. It did get warm after 15 to 20 minutes of use, but I didn’t notice any changes in performance even after playing for 30 minutes.Here are our benchmark results:The AnTuTu score is among the highest I’ve ever recorded on a smartphone (higher than the iPhone XS), only bested by the Xiaomi Mi 9 and the Galaxy S10e, both of which have the same Snapdragon 855 chip. The iPhone XS does beat out the S10 in Geekbench scores, though.Paired with this strong performance is Samsung’s new One UI software theme, which is running the latest version of Android 9 Pie. I like the look of the revamped interface, and critical elements of the user interface are placed toward the bottom of the screen for easier access. I’m also a big fan of the darker themes that protect my eyes when using the phone at night.There are small details that make the software shine in a way I’ve never seen before with a Samsung phone — like how a light circles the hole-punch camera when you swap to selfie mode or when the camera is trying to find your face to unlock the phone. The software is also deeply customizable – you can ditch the traditional Android navigation bar if you want. Short of the software on the Google Pixel 3 and the OnePlus 6T, One UI is one of my favorite interfaces on a phone right now.Software updates may prove lacking, however. The unlocked version of the Galaxy S9 got Android 9 Pie six months after Google released it, which is disappointing. That kind of delay is non-existent on Pixel phones or iPhones, and I hope the S10 will get updated to Android Q at a faster pace this year.The Galaxy S10e, S10, or S10 Plus can’t connect to 5G networks as they don’t have the required Qualcomm X50 modem inside (using the modem with the chip is an opt-in feature). Samsung has decided to make a special-edition Galaxy S10 5G instead, which will be able to connect to the next-generation mobile network, and it arrives sometime in the second quarter of the year. 5G service isn’t generally available yet, however, so it’s only a concern if you intend to hold on to the phone for years and need to future-proof.The Bixby button is still present on the S10, but it’s no longer an object of hatred. Why? Samsung pushed out an update that allows you to remap the Bixby button. To be fair, Bixby has performed well the times I have asked to set it reminders or asked it queries. But I have grown used to Google Assistant, which is also available on the phone, and often delivers better results.Remapping Bixby is a bit limited. You can set the button to open another app, but a double press (or long press) will still open Bixby. Or you can set it to open an app with a double press, and a single press will open Bixby. There’s no way to completely disable Bixby Voice and there’s no native way to remap the button to open Google Assistant, but there’s a workaround if you’re willing to install a third-party app.There is one new improvement to Bixby in the S10 — Bixby Routines — but I doubt Bixby’s “A.I.” has much to do with it. Routines works like IFTTT, where you can set up different profiles for your phone based on certain triggers. For example, I’ve set the phone to turn on sound when I arrive home, and to switch to mute when I arrive at work. It’s a powerful feature, and I like using it.You get the same rear camera experience between the Galaxy S10 and the S10 Plus. In years past, Samsung has always offered an extra camera on the Plus model — like on the Galaxy S9 Plus — offering a stronger reason to buy it over the smaller Galaxy S9. This year’s S10 Plus does have an extra camera, but it’s on the front, and it’s a depth-sensing camera (more on this below).There are three cameras on the back of the S10 and S10 Plus: A standard 12-megapixel lens with a variable f/1.5 to f/2.4 aperture (which Samsung first debuted last year) is paired with a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with a f/2.4 aperture. These two lenses are the same ones you’ll find on last year’s S9 Plus. The new, third camera is a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens with a f/2.2 aperture.Triple camera setups on smartphones aren’t new. The S10 is joining the ranks of phones like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and the LG V40 ThinQ, which have similar setups. But one thing I’ve learned from testing phones with triple cameras is that they are far more versatile than single- or even dual-lens cameras. Want a close up? Use the telephoto lens for 2x optical zoom. Want to capture a group photo? Swap to the ultra wide-angle lens. Transitioning between these lenses feels fast and fluid — either tap on the respective lens icons in the camera app, or just pinch in or out on the viewfinder and the phone will automatically swap to the relevant lens.Daytime photos captured by the S10 can look stunning. The phone does a good job of keep photos well-exposed — you won’t often run into blown out or under-exposed areas, thanks to HDR. Detail is strong, and colors don’t look too oversaturated. I did notice that photos tend to lack contrast, so they can look a little washed out, and they often have a warmer tone.The S10 can take solid photos in low-light environments as well, but details start to look fuzzy, and colors don’t look as accurate. There’s no proper night mode like on the Pixel 3 with Night Sight or the Mate 20 Pro with Night mode, which means it can’t offer stellar night photography. You’re best off using the standard lens in dark conditions, as the telephoto and wide-angle lenses deliver muddy images in these conditions.There are so many moments when a wide-angle lens makes more sense, and I’ve had a ton of fun using it.It’s not the best camera, but it’s still a fun, snappy camera to use, and the triple-lens setup adds tremendous value, particularly the wide-angle lens. The wide-angle lens makes sense, and I’ve had a ton of fun using it, even if it does have some distortion and doesn’t offer the strongest detail.What’s new with the camera software? Samsung has expanded Scene Optimizer’s shooting modes to 30 (that’s 10 new scenes, including dog, cat, shoes, and baby). Scene Optimizer uses artificial intelligence to automatically detect scenes like sunsets or people and attempts to adjust your photo to what it thinks looks best. I left it on for most of our testing, and it does help images pop, but can lead to oversaturation at times.My favorite feature is Shot Suggestions, which suggests straightening the camera if you’re tilting it, while also suggesting better compositions. All you need to do is point the camera at the recommended “Best Shot” and the phone will take the photo. It eliminates the need to tap the shutter button completely.Samsung’s Portrait Mode is called Live Focus, which is where a blur effect is added behind a subject. Live Focus photos aren’t as good as what I’ve seen from the Google Pixel 3 or the Nokia 9 PureView — details aren’t as strong, especially in low light, and the blur effect can look messy. I do like the new Live Focus mode called Color Point, which keeps the subject in color while making everything else black and white. It may take a few tries before you get the perfect shot, but it’s a fun effect.What’s more impressive is the camera’s 4K HDR video. It offers a cinematic look and it’s quite colorful. There’s also a “Super Steady” mode for when you want to capture stable video on the move. It’s all impressive, but there are limitations.  You can’t shoot 4K HDR at 60 frames per second, for example, just at 30FPS. You can’t use Steady Shot if you’re shooting in HDR, the quality is restricted to 1,920 x 1,080, and it only works with the main lens. And you need to manually change these settings, which is annoying.Where the S10 differs from the S10 Plus is the front camera setup, as the latter phone has two cameras, as opposed to the single one on the S10. It’s a 10-megapixel lens with f/1.9 aperture, which can now capture 4K UHD video. Selfies look good, though detail doesn’t shine through like it does on the Pixel 3.The S10 Plus’ additional 8-megapixel lens with a f/2.2 aperture does help it take stronger Live Focus selfies over the S10, as the extra lens is there to capture better depth data. Just look at the comparison below, and it’s easy to see which photo is better. The S10 Plus photo is more colorful, too.Samsung’s AR Emoji animations look less janky on the S10 Plus, though they’re not as good as Apple’s Memoji. Also, Samsung’s AR Emoji always get my skin color wrong.The Galaxy S10, much like the Galaxy S10 Plus, will get you through a solid day of use. I frequently arrived home with under 40 percent left, around 6 p.m. Plan on spending the night out? The phone still managed to last, only hitting around 15 percent close to 11:30 p.m.In our 10-hour video battery test, the S10 lasted for 10 hours and 50 minutes, a strong effort and one of our best scores. It’s beat by the Galaxy S10 Plus, which lasted 12 hours and 40 minutes. If you prize battery life, the S10 Plus may be the better choice, but you won’t be disappointed with the S10.The S10 has a feature called Wireless PowerShare, which lets you recharge any Qi-enabled products by placing it on the back of the phone, effectively turning it into a wireless charging pad. That means you can recharge a friend’s iPhone XS, for example, if they’re low on juice. I juiced up Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active from 25 to 33 percent in 10 minutes, and the phone lost around 5 percent.Though it lasts a long time, the S10 still uses Qualcomm’s aging Quick Charge 2.0 fast charging technology. Many phones have moved on to  Quick Charge 3 or 4, which charge much more quickly.The Samsung Galaxy S10 costs $900, and is available for purchase now from all major retailers and carriers globally. Check out our guide to purchasing the new S10 range for more details.Samsung offers a standard one-year warranty that protects the phone from manufacturer defects.The Galaxy S10 is the middle child between the S10e and the S10 Plus, and there are few reasons to buy it over the others. It’s an extremely capable phone that hits all the right marks, but it may be worth spending the extra $100 for the S10 Plus.The S10 Plus is worth the extra cash. Its upgrades do make it a better phone — namely the better battery life and better selfies.If software updates are important, then I recommend buying the Google Pixel 3 or 3 XL. They have the best cameras on a phone, great screens, and excellent software interfaces, though battery life suffers. And if iOS is an alternative you’re considering, then buy the iPhone XS. Check out our best smartphones guide for more options.The Galaxy S10 should last you three to four years, if not more. It’s built well, though the glass will be prone to cracks if you don’t protect it. An aging battery will likely be the first sign you need to upgrade.Samsung’s slow to roll out Android updates, but the S10 should get software updates for two years at the least.Yes, though upgrading to the S10 Plus is worthwhile. The Galaxy S10 is the awkward middle child in Samsung’s line-up, but it’s still an excellent phone, and you’ll be satisfied with your purchase."
76,Sony Xperia 1,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-1-review/,"Take the screen from your favorite cinema and miniaturize it so that it’s small enough to fit in a pocket. That’s the Sony Xperia 1, which may look like any other rectangular slab of a phone at first glance … but hold it and it feels like you’re carrying a mini home theater. It’s long, narrow, and has a dazzling 4K display that makes watching movies feel cinematic.But as with all Sony phones, there’s quite a lot of baggage. Should you buy this $900 behemoth? It’s Sony’s best phone to date, but no. Is it worth paying attention to? Absolutely.What sets the Xperia 1 apart from the competition is its use of the 21:9 aspect ratio that movies are typically filmed in. That means you’re getting a tall and narrow screen, as opposed to traditional smartphones with a 16:9 or 18:9 aspect ratio, making them wider and a tad shorter. This isn’t the first time we’re seeing a 21:9 smartphone; LG’s New Chocolate smartphone from 2009 had one, and more recently, the Sony Xperia 10, Xperia 10 Plus, and Motorola One Vision all have 21:9 aspect ratios.The Xperia 1 has the world’s first 4K HDR 21:9 OLED screen, though. It’s not true 4K as the screen resolution is 3,840 × 1,644 (rather than the typical 4K movie resolution of 3,840 × 2,160), but it’s still close enough to count.The 6.5-inch screen is incredibly sharp, and support for HDR means when watching HDR content on HDR-supported apps, you get more accurate color profiles the content creator intended to use. And color is really where the Xperia 1 shines. Sony said the Xperia 1 attempts to “provide a faithful reproduction of the creator’s intended vision” by also matching color reproduction from reference monitors (with the DCI-P3 and BT.2020 color gamut and standard) — it’s what Apple’s $5,000 Pro Display XDR claims as well.You need to toggle Creator Mode in Display settings for this to work, but when you do you’ll find natural and realistic colors in apps like Netflix; it’s not over-saturated like OLED screens on Samsung phones. Even better, there’s a tool to customize white balance to suit your liking. Watching 21:9 4K movies on Netflix is excellent, offering a truly immersive and cinematic experience, with wonderful colors.But there are two problems. First, most of the content I watch on my phone is not shot in 21:9. YouTube videos and TV shows on Netflix are largely filmed in 16:9 or another aspect ratio, so you’ll have to deal with big black bars on the sides of the content. You can pinch in to make it fit the full-frame, but you’re cutting off the image and cropping in on the resolution. While I still preferred to pinch in, there are moments I pinched out as the screen cut off people’s faces in the shows I watched.It’s powerful, speedy, and I had no trouble running the usual set of apps.Second, the Xperia 1’s screen doesn’t get too bright. It’s readable outdoors when using the usual apps like Google Maps or Twitter, but I tried watching episodes of Stranger Things and Game of Thrones outdoors and it was near impossible to see darker scenes. I compared this to the Galaxy S10 Plus, which wasn’t perfect, but it was significantly easier to see the same scenes clearly. If you consume a lot of videos on the go outdoors, this is a reasonable deal breaker.Paired with the cinematic screen experience are stereo speakers, and they get plenty loud — you won’t have trouble listening indoors and, provided you’re not right next to a construction site, outdoors as well. Turn on Dolby Atmos in the settings, because it drastically adds some punch to the audio quality, though the music still sounds a bit tinny and not as dynamic as the speakers on the Galaxy S10 Plus.If you’re an audiophile, you’ll be happy to hear the Xperia 1 supports audio formats like LPCM, FLAC, and ALAC. There sadly is no headphone jack, so you’ll have to utilize Bluetooth earbuds. Thankfully, support for LDAC and Qualcomm’s AptX HD ensures high-quality audio comes through wirelessly. This type of audio support is only matched by LG phones, such as the LG G8 and the V50 ThinQ (which go a step further as they retain headphone jacks).While I think the overall viewing experience here is a winner, the 21:9 screen and accurate color reproduction efforts are cater to a niche audience. Most people won’t be able to tell the difference between a 4K and 2K panel on a phone, and the superior brightness on phones like the Galaxy S10 detracts from the versatility of the Xperia 1.Here’s one feature of the 21:9 aspect ratio that I love: The super-tall screen. It’s difficult to hold and appreciate an 18:9 phone, let alone a 16:9 phone after using the Xperia 1. It’s tall and looks like a TV remote, which means reaching the top of the screen can be a challenge, but it’s also narrow. That makes it significantly easier to wrap your palm around it, and I love it.Rounded sides and corners make the phone comfortable to hold, a distinct departure from the more angular Sony phones of old. It looks modern and svelte, even if it doesn’t have the most bezel-less design.It’s difficult to hold and appreciate an 18:9 phone, let alone a 16:9 phone after using the Xperia 1.The right side are where you’ll find all the buttons, as well as the fingerprint sensor, and I have mixed feelings. I appreciate all the buttons being on a single side, but the power button is far too low for my taste. I have to shift my grip just to be able to tap it. Moving the volume rocker a little higher and squeezing the power button between it and the fingerprint sensor would have made a lot more sense.The fingerprint sensor itself is quick to react, though it can occasionally mistake your palm as an attempt to use the sensor, and I’ve had it tell me “Too many attempts. Try again later,” which is annoying. There’s one more button further below: A dedicated camera button. Tap and hold it to launch the camera, and you can use it to start recording video or to snap a photo. I’ve always enjoyed dedicated camera buttons, so it’s appreciated here.The back of the phone, like the front, is protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 6, and unsurprisingly, it’s a fingerprint magnet. Like my experience with almost all Sony phones, the Xperia 1 has a tendency to slide off tables and out of pockets when sitting, so a case may be a good idea to keep it protected.There’s a triple-camera module here, and it doesn’t sit flush with the rear panel, but the phone doesn’t rock too much when using it on a flat table. The back of the phone continues that elegant theme, though I’d nab the phone in purple instead of the black color seen here. It makes the Xperia 1 stand out.Sony’s Xperia 1 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 processor — the same chip inside most flagship Android phones ranging from the Samsung Galaxy S10 to the OnePlus 7 Pro — and it’s paired with 6GB of RAM. It’s powerful, speedy, and I had no trouble running the usual set of apps.Here are a few benchmark results:These scores are close to other Snapdragon 855 devices, but the Xperia 1 didn’t hit any records. Nevertheless, you won’t have a second thought on performance using this phone.I did have a visual issue running games, though. No, they didn’t perform poorly or look terrible; they were playable, but the interface is cut off for most games due to the unusual aspect ratio of the phone. Not all games support a 21:9 phone, after all. The in-game map in PUBG: Mobile was cut off, so it wasn’t very helpful in gameplay; the title card in Alto’s Odyssey is slightly cropped in, though this didn’t affect the game; and Pako: Forever had a giant black bar at the bottom, which is likely what you’ll find with several games. It’s not completely like this, as titles like Asphalt 9 Legends didn’t have any trouble visually with the 21:9 screen.There is a handy Game Enhancer app that launches a floating menu whenever you play a game, and it lets you choose a priority for battery life or performance, and also lets you customize the gaming experience by toggling things like Do Not Disturb mode on, for example.The software experience is close to stock Android 9.0 Pie — a great move on Sony’s part, as the interface looks a lot cleaner (and the lack of a Sony skin likely uses fewer resources).There are a few of Sony’s own apps and services available, one of which is SideSense. You can double tap your finger along the edges of the phone on the left and right side to launch SideSense, which opens a customizable tray of apps for quick access. You can also swipe your finger up or down on the bezel, and customize the action that follows. I’ve set a downward swipe to expand the notification drawer, and an upward swipe to open multitasking mode. It can be a little janky, but I found it useful.Speaking of multitasking, the 21:9 screen is perfect for split-screen mode. Put one app on top of another, and you get enough screen space to see content from both. That being said, the Xperia 1 hasn’t managed to make me remember to utilize split-screen mode. The only phone that has managed that is the Samsung Galaxy Fold.Every time I take it out of my pocket, it has managed to land in some deep system settings menu or an appThere are limitations to 21:9 screens, but it makes sense to use it with phones. Vertically-scrolling apps like Twitter and Instagram are superior, as you can see a lot more information without needing to scroll.All this being said, I’ve run into my fair share of issues using the Xperia 1. I haven’t been able to enjoy Bluetooth music playback, as audio gets stuttery when the phone is in my pocket — so I need to hold it in my hand. The phone also constantly operates by itself when it sits in my pocket. I’ve opened it once and found it had tweeted on my behalf (nonsensical gibberish); every time I take it out of my pocket, it has managed to land in some deep system settings menu or an app. It even managed to turn the flash on, making me utterly perplexed when I looked down at my pants pocket to see a bright LED shining through.Other issues include Instagram Stories being cut off due to the 21:9 aspect ratio, the camera app giving me an error (forcing a force close of the app), and music playback pausing when trying to snap a photo (update: this can be fixed if you turn off the camera shutter sound in the camera settings).Some of these problems may mean there’s an issue with my unit, but I’ve reached out to Sony and they haven’t said much yet other than they are looking into it. These kinds of bugs make the phone feel not as polished, which should not at all be the case for anyone spending more than $900.The trend with smartphone cameras these days is to include a triple-lens system. One high-quality standard lens, one telephoto for zooming in, and one wide angle for taking more in a single frame. It’s what’s on phones like the Galaxy S10 and Huawei P30 Pro, and the same is true on the Xperia 1. All the lenses have 12 megapixels; the standard uses an f/1.6 aperture with optical image stabilization (OIS); while the telephoto and wide-angle lenses use an f/2.4 aperture. The telephoto also has OIS, and sadly, the wide angle is a fixed-focus lens, which makes it a bit limiting.The results from the Xperia 1 produce some of the most natural colors I’ve seen in photographs captured by a smartphone camera, akin to the results on the Nokia 9 PureView, and that is this phone’s strength. Detail is strong in good lighting conditions with the main lens, though it tends to deteriorate in lesser light — especially with the other two lenses.In high-contrast scenarios, the Xperia 1’s HDR doesn’t work as well as other smartphone cameras. The darker scenes are far too underexposed (far more than real life), and the photograph of the Flatiron building is a good example showing this. When scenes are bright, the camera often overexposes these areas, and the image of my girlfriend sitting on an outdoor bench showcases this as well.I like the versatility the telephoto and wide-angle lenses bring, though there’s a little too much distortion on the latter lens (a setting lets you prioritize distortion, and while it helps a bit, it’s still not perfect, and image quality deteriorates). Results from the telephoto lens can be a little too soft at times.I’ve found autofocus to be slow, especially in low light, and I frequently found myself waiting for the camera to get the focus right to snap a shot. It’s also not the fastest camera all around. In the end, I’ve found most photos require a bit of editing to look good.That’s not to say I haven’t been impressed with some of the results. I love the shot of the pink rose, as the natural bokeh effect looks stunning. I also can’t stop staring at the image of the church with the orange and blue sky in the background. It’s fantastic. It’s unfortunate the results are not consistently this good.The Portrait Mode is … well, let’s just say you should avoid it. Photos do not retain a lot of detail, and the blur effect makes the outline of the subject look soft, and not defined. The blur accuracy is not great, and the whole feature barely works in low light.One area where the Xperia 1 shines is videography, but not with the main video section in the camera app. There’s a separate app called Cinema Pro (yes, it’s confusing), but this lets you capture 21:9 cinematic clips in 4K and HDR. It even supports Eye Autofocus, and you can customize exactly how you want the video to look. It requires a bit of technical know-how, though.Using the manual focus is also tricky, and you’ll want to do lots of practice to get the shots you want. You’ll also benefit from using a smartphone gimbal, as Cinema Pro doesn’t seem to offer any image stabilization. But colors are fantastic when the video is viewed on a high-quality monitor, and it looks sharp. I wouldn’t use it much in low light, as the quality goes down quick.There’s an 8-megapixel selfie camera on the Xperia 1, and it’s nothing to write home about. Images look good in strong lighting, but can be grainy in low light. It also tends to have issues in high-contrast scenarios.Yes, you can take better pictures with the manual mode on the Xperia 1 — that applies for almost any phone that has such a mode. But a large number of people don’t do that or aren’t interested in trying it out. It’s why we focused on the auto mode specifically in our test.Despite being such a long phone, the Xperia 1 has a disappointing small battery capacity: 3,300mAh. With light to medium use on a work day, I’ve been able to return home around 6 p.m. with 30% left in the tank. Push the phone a little harder, and you will likely have to juice it up before the night runs out.The Xperia 1’s screen doesn’t get too bright.The phone never died on me, but it came dangerously close. On days I stayed out longer (with heavier use), I’d arrive home around 9 p.m. with 15% left. It barely offers a full day, and that’s not great for a phone costing close to $1,000. Don’t get me wrong, the Xperia 1 does really well with what it has inside thanks to battery optimizations, but the phone should have close to a 4,000mAh battery inside.In our battery test, where we play a YouTube 1080p video over Wi-Fi with the brightness set to the max, the Xperia 1 performed poorly against the competition: It only lasted 7 hours and 10 minutes. The Galaxy S10 Plus lasted 12 hours and 40 minutes, and the LG V50 ThinQ managed 10 hours and 30 minutes.It’s fast to recharge, nabbing around 50% in 30 minutes of a charge with the included charger, but it’s a shame there’s no wireless charging available. Almost every flagship phone has this as a standard feature and it genuinely adds convenience, especially on phones that can’t ensure a full day of use.The Sony Xperia 1 is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, and other retailers. It costs $900 and comes with 128GB of internal storage (a MicroSD card slot is present).Sony offers a standard limited warranty that covers the phone from manufacturer defects for one year from the date of purchase.Sony’s Xperia 1 is the best Xperia phone to date. But while the cinematic screen is a treat, battery life and the camera could be better, and that’s without mentioning all the quirks with the software. At $950, it’s priced too high, because there are better phones available.Easily. If you’re looking for an enriched viewing experience, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is your best bet. It has an excellent AMOLED screen that may spruce up the colors, but it gets fantastically bright. The iPhone XS Max should also be considered. If you can’t do without a 4K 21:9 screen, then the Xperia 1 is your only choice.If you want the best camera experience, you can get good results with the S10 camera as well, and for videography you’ll have a better time with the iPhone. But the Pixel 3 XL should be given a look as it has the best camera you can buy on a phone.Of course, the recently released iPhone 11 will attract many buyers, and for good reason. At a starting price of $700, it’s a much better value.Check out our best smartphones guide for more.The Xperia 1 is covered in glass, so buy a case to keep it protected from accidental drops. It’s thankfully IP65/68 water-resistant, so it can handle itself against some water.Sony does a solid job of updating its phones to the latest software quickly, so you can be sure the Xperia 1 will get Android 10 Q a few months after Google releases it.No. I’ve had a largely pleasurable experience with the Xperia 1 — it’s by no means a “bad” phone — but there are quite a few shortcomings to warrant its $900 price tag.If you’re a Sony enthusiast, then you’re likely going to buy the Xperia 1 no matter what — and that’s fine. You’ll enjoy your time with the phone, as I have, but I do think it may be worth waiting for a price drop in the coming months."
77,Sony Xperia 5,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-5-ii-review/,"The Sony Xperia 5 II is the compact flagship smartphone many have been hankering for, but to get the best from this desirable high-spec/small-package combination, you will have to work hard and pay a substantial price. I’ve been living with the phone for a couple of weeks now, and this is what it’s really like.Glossy, glassy, and slippery like a well-oiled fish. That’s the best way to describe the Xperia 5 II, outside of its modest dimensions and low weight. It’s truly compact, due to the 8mm thickness and taller-not-wider shape enabled by the 21:9 aspect ratio screen. It weighs only 163 grams, and the slim build means even those with small hands will be able to reach the other side of the screen with their thumb. It easily slips into pockets and bags, and unfortunately, off of nearly every surface it touches as well.The Xperia 5 II is made from glass with an aluminum frame, and it slides around with a mind of its own on anything that’s not a perfectly flat surface. You also have to hold on tightly because of this, as there’s not much grip from the body. This brings me to the one thing I really dislike about the phone’s design — a mass of buttons running down the right-hand side.Top-to-bottom, there’s a small volume rocker, then the power button with the fingerprint sensor built in, then a Google Assistant button, and finally, a physical camera shutter button. Pick the Xperia 5 II up and it’s almost certain you’ll press a button, and it’s usually the useless Google Assistant one, which can’t be remapped or easily disabled. A frustrating design choice, made worse by not giving me the option to use the function or not.The fingerprint sensor is fast and reliable, but it is set a little too centrally on the side in my opinion, and I do like the physical camera shutter button, which is placed at the bottom of the frame so as not to intrude. It’s great to find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of the frame, despite the phone’s slimness. I like the pullout SIM card tray, which doesn’t require the use of a SIM removal tool, yet doesn’t affect the phone’s IP68 water-resistance rating.The Sony Xperia 5 II is easy to handle, compact enough for everyone, made from premium materials, and just about the perfect size for a smartphone. You’ll just have to deal with all the slipperiness.The 21:9 aspect ratio is made for watching super-widescreen movies, and contributes to the phone’s diminutive size. In reality, although 21:9 films are out there, they’re a little less common than 16:9 videos. This means you’ll still watch most with black bars running down either side, although there are plenty of games that take advantage of the super-widescreen view, including Minecraft, Asphalt 9, and Fortnite.It’s the spec we want in 2020, though. The OLED screen has a 2520 x 1080 resolution, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 10-bit HDR support. It’s not the 4K monster fitted to the Xperia 1 II, but under normal circumstances, you really won’t notice the lower pixel count, plus it has the same Creator Mode and image-enhancement technology from the more expensive phone. I love the way it looks, and doubt many will wish they’d splurged to get the Xperia 1 II instead.The display is lovely. Dreamy, in fact. Carfection’s Audi e-Tron Sportback review is sharp and colorful, while Mnet’s live version of WJSN Chocome’s Hmph! jumps off the screen with its electrified, ultra-vivid colors. Music videos are excellent on the Xperia 5 II due to its stereo speakers, which have masses of volume and a sweet controlled sound. And Sony’s Dynamic Vibration feature adds a vibration matched to what’s playing on the screen. It works well because you can adjust the intensity. Keep it low and it’s a pleasing additional effect.And when you’re using the phone vertically, as you do most of the time, that extra screen real estate gives you more content in feeds and messaging apps without having to scroll.No, the Xperia 5 II doesn’t quite reach the heights of the Xperia 1 II in terms of sheer, astonishing visual appeal on a mobile device, but it’s arguably all anyone will need.There are three 12-megapixel cameras on the back of the Xperia 5 II: An f/1.7 standard camera, an f/2.4 telephoto camera, and an f/2.2 ultrawide camera. Sony worked with Zeiss Optics on the lenses, and features include optical and electronic image stabilization, HDR, 4K video recording, eye-tracking, a 3x optical zoom, and Dual Pixel autofocus. It’s almost the same setup found on the back of the Xperia 1 II, but with a few alterations.Because its so similar to the Xperia 1 II, it has the same problems. The photos it takes are often beautiful, with excellent balance and dynamic range, but it struggles with focus up-close, and results can be inconsistent. It doesn’t have a night mode for super-bright night images, so lowlight images aren’t as striking as those taken with some other phones, but there’s plenty of realism and detail. The 8MP selfie camera washes skin tone out to the point of death on the default settings, so it’s wise to turn off all the enhancements before getting started there.Overall, I’d edit my images more often than not, a process that uses Google Photos editing suite, to get them looking just right. It’s worth it, because Sony’s camera captures plenty of delicious detail. I didn’t get a chance to play with the eye-tracking feature on the Xperia 5 II due to a lack of living creatures around me (thanks 2020), but I’ve used it in the past and been very impressed. Getting eye focus right is crucial to accurately capturing portrait shots, and it’s a feature few other phones have.Sony sells the Xperia cameras on the merits of its Photo Pro and Cinema Pro apps, which have been tuned by Sony’s expert camera and cinema teams, and are essentially jazzed-up manual modes. If you regularly use manual mode on your smartphone’s camera, you’ll appreciate the depth and versatility each offers, and be able to create impressive stills and video with them. However, if you’ve never touched manual mode and are not familiar with the principles of shutter speed, white balance, ISO, and manual focusing, then the learning curve is very steep.It sounds like I’m down on the Xperia 5 II’s camera, but I’m not really. It just frustrates. It can take some wonderfully atmospheric photos with beautiful colors, I like the combination of an ultrawide and a telephoto, and the physical camera shutter button is a great tactile, ergonomic addition. But it’s inconsistent, is sometimes outperformed by other cameras on phones that cost less, and puts too much emphasis on features that will be beyond many potential owners.Everything is there in Sony’s camera on the Xperia 5 II and the Xperia 1 II to take wonderful photos, but unlike the Pixel 5 or iPhone 12 Pro, it won’t happen just by pressing the shutter button. If that sounds like something you like, and are interested in learning more about the mechanics of photography, you’ll appreciate the Sony phone more.Using the Xperia 5 II as my daily phone has not revealed any performance shortcomings. It is as fast as you’d expect from a phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor inside, along with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage space. Asphalt 9 Legends plays brilliantly and takes advantage of the 21:9 aspect ratio screen too, and the phone’s lightness makes it excellent for long gaming and movie sessions.Sony’s user interface with Android 10 is unobtrusive, and the software is fast and reliable. There are various non-Sony apps preinstalled including LinkedIn, which disturb you with annoying notifications and are a pain to manually uninstall. The tall screen takes a little getting used to if you’ve been looking at a wider aspect ratio screen. Icons can seem tightly grouped together, and scrolling apps like Twitter and Instagram feels constricted at first, but the ergonomic benefits the shape brings soon take over.I have encountered some problems with Wi-Fi range and cellular connectivity. The Xperia 5 II dropped its signal more often than other phones I test, and lacks the Wi-Fi range of other models including the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 Pro. Calls are good, but it’s easy to cover the microphone on the bottom of the phone with your finger, and the front camera retains the washed-out look seen in its selfies during video calls.In the U.K. the phone supports 5G, but it does not in the U.S. While 5G isn’t a reason to buy any phone at the moment, it will matter down the road, and should be a consideration when purchasing an expensive device. It’s also unfortunate the phone still has Android 10 rather than Android 11, and there’s no confirmed date for the software update either.The 4,000mAh battery has proven very strong, easily lasting me a full day with average use of between two and four hours of screen time each day. It returned very similar battery performance to the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE I’d used previously, ending long days with around 30% remaining. Without video calls, the battery should last for two days without a problem.Sadly, there’s no wireless charging, and although it supports 21-watt fast wired charging, you get an 18W charger in the box. If you happen to have the higher-wattage charger already, it’ll zip to 50% in 30 minutes. If not, then expect it to be at least 45 minutes. I like the adaptive charging mode though, which manages overnight charging cycles to extend the battery’s life span.The Sony Xperia 5 II is available to pre-order in the U.S. ahead of a December 3 release for $949 (it has already been discounted to $900). It’s available now in the U.K. for 799 British pounds.If Sony’s 21:9 aspect ratio screen and associated design appeals to you, and it really should, the Xperia 5 II is the model to buy compared to the Xperia 1 II. It does almost everything for $250 less. The screen, battery life, build, and compact dimensions all impress, although you do have to put in some effort to make the most of the camera’s talents.I like the quirky Xperia 5 II, but recognize there are better buys for the same price or less. It’s definitely part of a dying breed: A truly high-spec compact flagship phone.Yes. At $949, even with its high specification, the Xperia 5 II has plenty of competition. The $900 OnePlus 8 Pro is our pick of the Android alternatives, due to the great software and screen, while the $1,000 iPhone 12 Pro is a superb alternative, providing excellent software, camera, and design. The Galaxy S20 Plus is around the same price now, and if you’re happy with the plastic back, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is great value at $699.All of those phones are larger than the Xperia 5 II, though. If you want a brilliant point-and-shoot camera in a compact smartphone, the $699 Google Pixel 5 is our pick.The tech is there for the Xperia 5 II to last at least the duration of a two-year contract or financing plan before it perhaps starts feeling its age. The lack of 5G may prompt you to update around this time anyway. The phone is made of glass, but does have an IP68 water-resistance rating, so should prove relatively durable inside a case.Sony has been frustratingly obtuse about its Android software update schedule. It told Digital Trends it’s committed to providing regular and timely updates when we asked it about Android 11 on the Xperia 1 II, but didn’t give any specific dates. It’s similarly unclear for the Xperia 5 II. Expect an update then, but just be patient.No, there are better phones with a more generally accessible camera available for the same price. And the lack of 5G in the U.S. hurts its longevity. It’s a better option in the U.K., though, due to the slightly better price and 5G support."
78,Sony Xperia 10,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-10-review/,"Sony’s trying to reboot its smartphone business with a simplified approach at the premium end of the market. The company’s one true flagship, the Xperia 1, is flanked by a couple of cheaper devices that sit somewhere at the upper end of budget or the lower end of midrange. The smallest and cheapest is the Xperia 10, which costs $350, exactly the same as our current favorite budget phone, the Nokia 7.1, and $50 more than the attractive Moto G7. The question is: Can Sony make a compelling budget phone?Smartphones have become increasingly homogenous, but Sony’s smartphones have always stood out a little, and not always in a good way. The Sony Xperia 10 is immediately recognizable as a Sony phone; it has an angular shape and it’s taller than other phones.Over the last couple of years, big bezels surrounding the screen have been responsible for that extra height, but in Sony’s latest phones, the screen extends almost to the edges on the sides and bottom. The top has a chunkier bezel for the front-facing camera, other sensors, and an earpiece. In finally slashing those bezels down, Sony decided to expand the screen instead of shrinking the body, so you get an unusual 21:9 aspect ratio.The result is a tall, but narrow phone. It looks attractive and proves very comfortable to handle. If you’re a fan of Sony’s design language, then you’re going to like the look of the Xperia 10.There’s a USB-C port flanked by speakers on the bottom, a 3.5mm audio jack up top, and a power button, fingerprint sensor, and volume rocker on the right side. Lest you forget this is a budget phone, the back and sides are a single piece of polycarbonate with a metallic sheen. There’s a horizontal dual-lens camera suite at the top with the flash above.My review unit is navy, but you can also get this phone in classic black, pink, or silver.Switching from the Moto G7, I found the Sony Xperia 10 much more comfortable to use one-handed. Put them side by side and they look like Laurel and Hardy.You get a 6-inch IPS LCD screen with the Xperia 10 and, because of that 21:9 aspect ratio, it has a resolution of 2,520 x 1,080 pixels. It’s slightly sharper than both the Nokia 7.1 and the Moto G7. That aspect ratio coupled with Sony’s video processing know-how makes it ideal for watching movies, which are generally filmed at 21:9. Though it’s worth noting that TV shows and some other content will have black bars at the sides.The screen is one of the highlights of this phone and I found that the aspect ratio worked well for reading on the web, as well as for movies and gaming. The contrast is good, and it’s plenty bright for outdoors legibility. There’s a Super-vivid mode in the display settings if you prefer a saturated look, but the colors are vibrant enough out of the box. Until OLED screens start coming to budget phones, this is as about as good a screen as you’ll find in this price category.Before moving on from the design section, a quick word on the vibration motor. It seems like an odd thing to highlight, but the vibrate function in the Xperia 10 is terrible. When I first turned the phone on, I was concerned it had been damaged in transit because of the asthmatic vibrate on start up. It’s obviously an area where Sony economized.The Sony Xperia 10 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor inside with 3GB of RAM. This processor is getting a bit long in the tooth and it shows. While swiping around feels slick, there are noticeably long pauses when loading games and switching between apps. The camera app also froze on me a couple of times.I played Plants vs. Zombies: Heroes and it ran without issues. PUBG:Mobile took forever to load, but it ran without a problem, albeit on the lowest quality graphical setting. If you want to play demanding games, then the Xperia 10 is not for you.Both the major competitors for the Xperia 10 — the Nokia 7.1 and Moto G7 — have slightly newer, more powerful processors, and an extra 1GB of RAM, and you can feel the difference it makes. Here are some benchmark results:It’s clear to see that the Sony Xperia 10 is lagging a bit here, apart from the 3DMark benchmark where it did quite well. Regardless, Sony should have beefed up the hardware here just a bit.But if you don’t use demanding apps or play a lot of games, this might not be a major concern. For general web browsing, messaging, movie watching and a spot of casual gaming, the Sony Xperia 10 will serve you well.There’s an ample 64GB of storage available and you can always insert a MicroSD card into the phone to expand that capacity.The Xperia 10 runs Android 9 Pie with Sony’s user interface on top and a handful of preinstalled apps. My review unit came with stalwarts like Netflix and Facebook, alongside Sony apps like Xperia Lounge, but the apps you’ll find on yours depends on where you live and where you buy your phone from.It feels a lot like stock Android in terms of basic navigation; there are a few extra settings in the menus, but it’s easy to get to grips with. I can’t help feeling things like the Gallery app are redundant when you have Google Photos, but I didn’t encounter too much bloatware here.While the Xperia 10 feels pretty slick in the software department — and Sony has a decent record for updating its phones — I would prefer to see the company adopt Android One like Nokia does with its budget devices. Android One phones are guaranteed to get at least two years of Android version updates and three years of security updates, and that’s a big benefit in a budget phone.I’m glad to report that the Sony Xperia 10 does come with NFC support, so you can share via Android Beam and make wireless payments with Google Pay if needed.The Sony Xperia 10 has a dual-lens camera, pairing a 13-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and a secondary 5-megapixel depth sensor. The camera app itself is a little slow, along with a slow shutter speed, and slow image processing, but you can snap some lovely shots.When the sun is out, you’ll have no trouble capturing good photos with the Xperia 10. The colors are vibrant without straying too far from how the scene really looked, and it captures plenty of detail. You can definitely get better results if you go into manual mode and tweak the settings, but all the photos in this review were taken with the automatic settings.Like the Moto G7, I found the Xperia 10 camera struggles with contrast sometimes and overexposes light areas, but it doesn’t seem to be quite as bad. Low light is a major weakness for both phones, and you’ll see a lot of noise creep in as soon as the light begins to fade.One area where the Moto G7 camera beats the Xperia 10 is portraits of people with that coveted bokeh effect that blurs the background. Sony has a bokeh mode option in the camera app, but I really didn’t get on well with it. Repeated instructions to move further away from the subject or move closer for that elusive sweet spot became tiring. Occasionally the results were good, but I preferred the photos of people I took with the standard photo mode.There is a risk of blurry photos because, like every other budget phone camera, it lacks optical image stabilization (OIS). If you don’t have a steady hand or a steady subject, then photos are not going to come out well.There is also a selfie portrait mode which employs the 8-megapixel front-facing camera and it’s actually much easier to use than the bokeh mode on the rear camera.The Xperia 10 can also capture 4K videos at 30 frames per second in the 21:9 aspect ratio if you fancy developing a cinematic look for your home movies. It will also shoot Full HD at 60 frames per second, but I recommend going with the default Full HD at 30 fps, because it enables object tracking and SteadyShot image stabilization.Although it has a sizable 2,870mAh battery inside, stamina is a definite weakness for the Xperia 10. On an average day the phone struggled to make it to bedtime with anything left in the tank. A single game of PUBG: Mobile chewed through 11 percent of the battery. If you want to watch video, play games, and take a lot of photos with this phone, then you’ll need to carry a portable battery charger with you.In our battery test, streaming a Full HD video from YouTube, the Xperia 10 lasted just 4 hours and 54 minutes. That’s far from impressive, and a lot less than cheaper budget phones like the Moto G7 and even the Nokia 3.1 Plus.Wired charging via the USB-C port is fast; I was able to take the battery from zero to 88 percent in an hour. The Xperia 10 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 standard and USB Power Delivery, which is rare in budget phones. That’s a good thing, because based on my experience, you’re going to be plugging in a lot. There’s no support for wireless charging here.The Sony Xperia 10 costs $350. You can order it unlocked from Amazon, Best Buy, or B&H and it ships starting March 18. Although you won’t find it at carrier stores, the Xperia 10 will work with AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon in the U.S.It comes with a standard one-year limited warranty which covers defects in design, materials, or workmanship.The Sony Xperia 10 is a good phone that mostly justifies the $350 price. The display is pleasing, the camera is capable, and I like the design. The trouble is that Sony has compromised in two vital areas: Performance and battery life, and that’s enough to sink any recommendation.Yes, you can buy the Nokia 7.1 for exactly the same price and it matches or bests the Xperia 10 in every area.You could also save yourself $50 and go for the Moto G7. There isn’t a big gap between them, and there are things I prefer about the Xperia 10, but at $50 less the Moto G7 is better value for sure.The other phone you might look at is the Xperia 10 Plus, which costs a fair bit more at $430, but stretches the screen up to 6.5 inches and packs a superior processor and an extra 1GB of RAM.You should get two years out of the Sony Xperia 10, and we’re hopeful that Sony will update the software as it does have a decent update record. However, you might tire of the slow processor before then.Since its plastic, it’s likely more durable than a glass phone, but there’s no IP rating for water resistance. It might be worth grabbing a case to protect it.No. Most people will be better off buying the Nokia 7.1 or the Moto G7. But if you’re a big Sony fan and the flagship Xperia 1 is too rich for your blood, or if movie watching is a big priority for you in a phone, then you’ll enjoy the Xperia 10."
79,Xiaomi Mi 9,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-mi-9-review/,"When you get behind the wheel of a really fast car, there’s always a moment in the first few miles when it feels so responsive, so alive, that you say to yourself, “wow, this is quick.” That’s what happens when you start to use your favorite apps on the Xiaomi Mi 9, which has the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor inside. It’s an absolute monster, and for once, the marketing claim that it provides a 45-percent greater performance than its predecessor doesn’t feel like an empty promise. The Xiaomi Mi 9 is a superphone, in the same way a Ferrari 488 GTB is a supercar.It’s not superphone or supercar expensive though, making it one of the most exciting and desirable phones of 2019. We were so impressed, we gave it our coveted Best of Show award at Mobile World Congress 2019.Speed, in a smartphone at least, is relatively hard to measure. We’ve run some benchmarks for reference, but also want to describe the experience here. The speed comes across in smoothness — it’s just so damn silky, which is definitely what strikes you first when using the Mi 9.Next it’s the speed with which apps open, and then respond. There’s no slow down, everything scrolls smoothly, and if there is a hold up, you get the distinct impression it’s a network issue, rather than the device. The Xiaomi Mi 9 is so quick, it makes lightning bolts look sluggish and lazy.How about the benchmarks?The AnTuTu 3D scores trounces everything before it, including the Samsung Galaxy S10, and even the iPhone XS. The Mi 9 is one of the first smartphones to use the Snapdragon 855, and its performance here makes us very excited about 2019’s flagship devices all round. It’s joined by 6GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage space. A version with 12GB of RAM will be released in China, but won’t make it to the U.K. apparently, which is a shame, although we’re not sure it would make the phone any quicker during everyday use.Don’t wonder, don’t hesitate, and don’t think I’m exaggerating — the Xiaomi Mi 9 is a fabulous, high-performance monster of a smartphone.The Xiaomi Mi 9 is so quick, it makes lightning bolts look sluggish and lazy.The Xiaomi Mi 9 looks like a supercar as well. Sleek and curvy, the phone is made from glass, with Gorilla Glass 5 on the back, and Gorilla Glass 6 over the screen. The sides of the rear panel gently curve before meeting the chassis, making it immensely comfortable to hold. There are four different looks — a black version you see in our main photos, along with a blue, a lavender, and a transparent finish too.We’ll save you some decision-making time. The lavender Mi 9 is utterly stunning, and the one we’d choose to buy. That said, the transparent model is also very eye-catching, with some very cool details. No, you’re not looking at the actual components under that piece of 4D curved glass, but see if you can spot the reference to the Battle Angel codename, and the wireless charging symbol too. We’re confident you want the Mi 9, it’s just a case of choosing between the lavender or transparent finish.Staying on the back, the triple-lens camera is set inside a large camera bump. It really is very prominent, and comes into direct contact with surfaces it’s laid on. Xiaomi said it has used sapphire glass over the lenses, meaning scratches shouldn’t be a problem, but independent tests have shown it’s not that much tougher than normal tempered glass.We’re confident you want the Mi 9, it’s just a case of choosing between the lavender or transparent finish.On the front, the 6.4-inch AMOLED screen has a teardrop notch, a 2,340 x 1,080 pixel resolution, and minimal bezels at the top and bottom. It looks excellent, and there are many customizations to make sure it looks exactly to your liking. For example, you can adjust the brightness in standard view or night mode, choose contrast and color levels, and automatically set a reading mode.The downside of the glass body and subtle curves is the slipperiness. It simply doesn’t feel safe in your hand. There’s more grip on the average wet fish than there is on the Mi 9, and without a case, you tend to hold on so tightly the thin edges become a little uncomfortable. The glassy, glossy, slippery Mi 9 may feel like it’s an accident waiting to happen, but it’s so delicate and pretty, you’ll want to make sure it stays protected.This is the first time Xiaomi has used a triple-lens camera on one of its phones, and it has chosen the new Sony IMX586 sensor with 48-megapixels to headline the array. We’ve seen this already on the Honor View 20, and expect it to be one of the best cameras out there over the coming year. It’s joined on the Mi 9 by a 12-megapixel telephoto lens and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 117-degree viewing angle.			Like Honor, the 48-megapixel mode is not activated as standard. You have to open the Settings menu and choose it from there, which is rather clunky. It also means there’s a chance people will forget about it, as it reverts to normal mode after the camera app is put to sleep, or be completely unaware they’re not shooting photos at the full resolution. The reason Xiaomi has done this is the 48-megapixel mode is really only suitable for some situations, like scenes in good lighting. The camera takes 12 megapixel shots as standard, and uses pixel binning technology to draw in more light and increase performance.What’s it like? For the most part, excellent. The artificially intelligent night mode is effective at exposing more detail in low-light shots without sacrificing quality or detail, while not aggressively changing the image like the Pixel 3’s Night Sight mode. In sunny conditions, the blue sky pops in photos taken with the Mi 9, and the bokeh mode is great at adding subtle amounts of depth to a photo without taking away realism. We also like the flexibility and creative opportunity of having a wide-angle lens, a zoom, a night mode, various A.I. settings, and the large 48-megapixel mode all in one camera.However, the software may need tweaking to bring out the best here. Exposure isn’t always very precise in standard mode, and a relatively pleasant blue sky late in the day came out rather grey and lacking in visual appeal. We also lost some photos when the camera app crashed after taking some 48-megapixel images and night mode shots, both of which require longer processing time which is where the app fell over.A recent update to the camera has improved the situation, and added a new Moon Mode. This is specifically made to take photos of the moon, and is activated through the standard photo mode using artificial intelligence. The first batch of photos we took using it — with a tripod — were not very impressive, although again, we expect software tweaks over time to increase its ability.Overall though, there’s plenty to enjoy at the moment, and some potential for improvement through future software updates too.Xiaomi claims the Mi 9 has the fastest wireless charging yet seen in a smartphone. It uses a proprietary technology built into a special wireless charger to pump 20 watts of power into the phone’s 3,300mAh battery. The claim was an hour and 40 minutes to full on the special wireless charging puck, but this is conservative, and it rockets to full in about 90 minutes. Very impressive for wireless charging.The Mi 9 has the fastest wireless charging yet seen in a smartphone.You have to use the special Xiaomi wireless charger for this performance though, and it doesn’t come with the phone. It’s a serious piece of kit — about twice the thickness of a regular wireless charger, and it even has a fan inside that churns away when it’s charging the phone. The sound is enough that you won’t want it next to your bed, which is a shame. You also have to use the included Mi 9 charging brick and USB Type-C cable too. Ignore the fast wireless charging and plug in the cable alone, and things get even faster — expect a fully charged battery in just 65 minutes, based on our tests.Now you’re probably looking at the relatively small capacity on the battery and thinking you’re going to need the fast charging pretty often. The excellent news here is you won’t, as the Snapdragon 855 is highly power efficient, and Xiaomi’s MIUI is adept at managing its power effectively, as even after an 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. day of using the phone consistently, it still had more than 40-percent charge left. Even on heavy days, we have not fallen below 15-percent after 15 hours of use. A 1,080p YouTube video played at maximum brightness for 10 hours 15 minutes before the battery was flat.We’re also pleased with the new in-display fingerprint sensor on the Mi 9. It’s an updated version over the Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro, and it’s consistently more reliable than before. It’s more forgiving about finger placement, faster to unlock the phone than old versions, and works almost as reliably as a rear mounted fingerprint sensor too, although it still can’t quite match the speed. The Mi 9 doesn’t have face unlock, so this is an important step forward.Yes, the Xiaomi Mi 9 uses Android 9.0 Pie, but it’s heavily disguised underneath Xiaomi’s own MIUI 10 user interface, seen here in its “Global” form and in version 10.2. The positives include the outright speed, the attractive animations and transitions, the minimalist and well-designed icons and menus, and the intuitive gesture control system.On the negative side, the notifications aren’t very reliable — messages are missed, and icons constantly lie to you — and there’s no app tray option, so all your apps stay on the home screen. Plus despite having NFC and setting it up, Google Pay refused to work in the U.K. on our review device. Software updates may fix these aspects in the future.The most controversial aspect are the ads. Xiaomi is an ecosystem company, and in China runs its own app store along with a variety of other ways to make a profit, including serving ads on some of its pre-installed apps. This still exists on its phones sold internationally. It’s not constant, and it’s not in obnoxious places, but it can still be distracting and annoying. For example, download an app from Google Play, and MIUI will “scan” it for problems and let you know it’s fine … while displaying an ad.These ads may also appear when using the installed music or video apps, and should perhaps be considered a necessary evil when paying so little for such a powerful device, although there are ways to disable them if you’re willing to spend time doing so. Whether you accept that you may be occasionally shown ads will be down to personal choice. We’re not fans, but because they never truly intrude on usage, we’re prepared to be slightly forgiving.The Xiaomi Mi 9 will be available in the U.K. soon, and is already available in Europe and China. The price in Europe is 450 euros ($510) for the 6GB/64GB model, and 500 euros ($570) for the 6GB/128GB version, which is the same as the Mi Mix 3. The U.K. price still to be confirmed, but it’s likely to match the 500 British pound ($660) Mi Mix 3. The phone will be available through Xiaomi’s own online store and its retail partners.It won’t be sold officially in the U.S., but keen buyers will be able to import the phone through a third party. However, while it’ll operate with GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile, the bands may not fully support 4G LTE. We tested the phone in the U.K. on the EE network and it operated without issue.Xiaomi provides a two-year warranty on its smartphones in the U.K..A super-fast smartphone that’s yours for a much lower price than expected, the Mi 9 shows how quickly Xiaomi is maturing, and how much it’s working on creating smartphones that appeal to those outside China. The Mi 9 is a compelling, high-performance smartphone that’s sure to become one of the year’s best.Ignoring the price for a second, let’s talk about other smartphones with the Snapdragon 855 inside. The list is short, and the big competitors are the Samsung Galaxy S10e, as well as the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus. The latter two are several hundred dollars more than the Xiaomi Mi 9, and the S10e is a little more expensive. They’re excellent, but it’s questionable whether you need to spend so much on a high performance smartphone today.Put price back in the equation, and the Mi 9 stands above much of the competition at the moment due to the Snapdragon 855. You have the choice of the $550 OnePlus 6T, the 500 British pound ($660) Honor View 20, and the 550 British pound ($730) Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018). The $700 Nokia 9 PureView is a good alternative if you’re a serious photographer too.The hardware and technology inside is the best you can get at the moment, so buy it with the knowledge it will last you several years before you feel the need to upgrade. The body is made of glass, and as the phone is quite slippery it would be wise to put it in a decent case. The phone is not water resistant either, with no IP rating at all, so you’ll have to be careful with it.Yes, the Xiaomi Mi 9 is one of 2019’s shrewdest smartphone purchases, in terms of performance-and-features-per-dollar."
80,Asus ZenFone 5,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-zenfone-5q-review/,"The Asus Zenfone 5Q was originally introduced at Mobile World Congress 2018, as part of the company’s Zenfone 5 series. It’s not the flagship model out of the bunch – that honor goes to the Asus Zenfone 5Z – but at $300, the Zenfone 5Q is significantly cheaper and still boasts the same beautiful design.Of course, there are compromises to account for the $200 price difference — the camera is mediocre, and this phone most likely won’t receive the latest version of Android. While it has impressive battery life and a vibrant display, we’re not convinced the features on the Zenfone 5Q justify the price tag.Our favorite part of the Zenfone 5Q is its design — for a budget device, the smartphone looks more expensive than $300. With rather slim bezels and a glass body, it not only looks incredibly sleek but feels nice too. In fact, we didn’t mind swapping our iPhone XS to tote around the Zenfone 5Q when it comes to aesthetics. While our review unit is listed as “Midnight Black,” it looks more like a dark navy blue at first glance, especially when the light hits it.At the top are two front-facing cameras, with an LED light and speaker sandwiched in between. A volume rocker is situated on the right side, with the power button underneath it. On the left is where you’ll find the dual SIM tray.A feature that’s becoming more and more uncommon is the headphone jack, which the Zenfone 5Q houses at the top of the device. At the bottom, there’s unfortunately a Micro USB charging port instead of USB-C — which is more universal and convenient when it comes to charging. This is also where you’ll find the single speaker.When it comes to sound quality, the Zenfone 5Q gets loud enough to hear both indoors and out and the quality is fairly decent. But we can’t ignore how muffled it sounds at loud volumes — while it’s not terrible, we’d advise a Bluetooth speaker if you want to crank the volume up.The smartphone looks more expensive than $300.While the phone is large in size, the rounded edges help with grip and it’s slim and lightweight enough that it’s comfortable to hold. On the back, there’s a stacked dual-lens camera module at the top that’s slightly raised — and the flash sits right next to it. Below it is an indented fingerprint sensor with the ASUS logo at the bottom of the device.We do wish the fingerprint sensor was placed a bit lower than the spot it’s currently in, but it’s still comfortable to access and use. It’s also extremely responsive, but we relied more on face unlock, which worked quickly in most settings.The 6-inch LCD display on the front has a 18:19 aspect ratio and 2,160 x 1,080-pixel resolution. We love how vibrant and bright content looks on the screen. With such a large and stunning display, we particularly enjoyed watching Netflix on it — the high resolution made the video quality look sharp and we didn’t run into any issues.Outdoors we didn’t have trouble viewing anything on the display and didn’t have to tinker with brightness the way we’ve had to with other smartphones in the past. However, taking photos was a different matter and we found it was tough to see exactly what we were pointing the camera at even in broad daylight.When it comes to durability, there’s no IP rating for the Zenfone 5Q so you won’t want to jump in the pool with it. We haven’t dropped the phone yet either, but with a glass back we definitely recommend grabbing a case for it. It made us a bit nervous to text one-handed, afraid that a drop without a case would completely shatter the glass.The Asus Zenfone 5Q is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 630, which was released last year. We found that apps opened quickly and there was no stutter or lag when scrolling in apps like Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. It also comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage — and if that’s not enough, there’s a MicroSD card slot that supports up to 2TB.When it comes to gaming, we didn’t run into any issues playing The Sims Mobile. Content looked great on the large display and the graphics ran smoothly. Here are the benchmark results:The Zenfone 5Q offers more powerful performance than competitors like the Honor 7X (which had an AnTuTu score of 63,311), but it didn’t beat out the Nokia 6.1 or Moto G6 Plus — which had scores of 88,595 and 90,483, respectively. While the Nokia 6.1 is cheaper by $30, the Moto G6 Plus has the highest score of all the phones mentioned and only costs $50 more than the Zenfone 5Q.With the Zenfone 5Q, Asus takes pride in the four cameras featured on the smartphone. On the back is a dual camera — the primary sensor comes in at 16-megapixels with an f/2.2 aperture, while the secondary sensor features a 120-degree wide-angle lens. Meanwhile, the front facing camera also has a dual-lens setup — its primary sensor is 20-megapixels with an f/2.0 aperture and there’s a 120-degree wide-angle lens.Those seem like impressive specs on paper, but we weren’t impressed with the results. Overall, we found our photos were both blurry and noisy. Without HDR we were left with photos that were either over exposed or under exposed in specific areas — like the trees surrounding landscape shots. With HDR turned on, the photos were decent in the daylight, but low light performance was poor. In wide angle shots, parts of the image always came out blurry.On the other hand, the 20-megapixel front-facing camera takes impressive selfies that capture a lot of detail. In the photos that we took, we could see the minor breakouts on our forehead, fly-aways when looking at our hair, and our skin color looks extremely accurate as well. If you’re the type who likes to edit their selfies, But when we switched to wide-angle selfies, we found that each snapshot came out blurry. Asus conveniently packed in a “Selfie Master” app which lets you apply a beauty filter in real-time before you take the selfie. There’s also the option to edit it within the app afterwards.We found our photos were both blurry and noisy.While it can take some good photos, it requires staying super still and having the best lighting conditions possible. Other than that, though, there’s nothing noteworthy about the Zenfone 5Q’s camera capabilities. If the camera is really important to you, we think you might be better off with a different phone.The Zenfone 5Q runs Android 7.0 Nougat — specifically 7.1.1 which was the second to last update to come to the 2017 operating system. It’s disappointing that the phone launches without the latest version of Android, or even the one before that, especially with a smartphone that costs as much as $300. But the device should be receiving Android 8.0 Oreo soon.The company’s ZenUI skin is not our favorite and there are some questionable features that are probably best ignored — but it’s better than before. You do at least have your standard suite of Google apps pre-installed — you can swipe right from the home screen to access the Google Feed, or to activate Google Assistant, press and hold the home button.With a 3,300mAh battery powering the ASUS Zenfone 5Q, we were able to get a substantial amount of juice out of it for long periods of time. Before switching to it as our primary phone, we left it on overnight and still had 81 percent at 9 a.m. (that’s with all of our social media notifications coming in).By 12:25 p.m., after having used Google Maps, Spotify, and taking a bunch of photos, it was at about 66 percent. We then took it through some benchmark testing at which point the battery only dropped to about 51 percent by 2:30 p.m. Towards the end of our work day, which included text messaging and scrolling through social media, we were at 48 percent and by 11:30 p.m, we were at 37 percent.Of course, the longevity of the battery varies depending on how much you use it but either way, you can easily get an entire day’s worth (and then some) out of the Zenfone 5Q.Unfortunately, the Micro USB charging is slow and there’s no support for wireless charging here.The 64GB Asus Zenfone 5Q costs $300 and can be purchased unlocked directly from Asus or from Amazon and Best Buy. But it’s only compatible with GSM networks like AT&T and Verizon — those with Sprint and Verizon are out of luck. As for colorways, you’ll be able to choose between black or white.Asus offers a standard one-year warranty on the Asus Zenfone 5Q that protects against manufacturing defects.The Asus Zenfone 5Q is a beautiful smartphone on the outside, but once you peek under the hood you start to realize it’s not as impressive — especially for $300. There are plenty of other midrange smartphones on the market with the same processor, but better cameras, and more recent software.Yes. We recommend the Nokia 6.1 which costs $270 — saving you $30. It comes with the same Snapdragon 630 processor, and the same 16-megapixel rear camera as the Zenfone 5Q. While it isn’t as sleek, it still has an attractive design, and with an all-metal build you won’t have to worry about shattering it. You may also consider spending a little more to snag the Nokia 7.1.There’s also the Honor 7X which will set you back $200, or its successor, the Honor 8X. The standard Moto G6 is another option, but for those in the U.K. we recommend the Moto G6 Plus. For even more options, you can learn more in our best cheap phones guide.The Zenfone 5Q should last you around two years — if you’re careful with it. Since it’s made of glass, you might want to get a protective case to keep it from shattering.It might receive a few security updates but running Android 7.0 Nougat it’s not guaranteed you’ll be able to upgrade to a more recent operating system.No, there are many other choices on the market if you’re looking for a budget phone. While you might have to spend a little bit more, shelling out extra cash will provide you with a more up to date smartphone that packs an even better processor and camera."
81,Honor 8x,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/honor-8x-news/,"Last year’s Honor 7X quickly became one of our favorite budget phones thanks to its appealing design, great specs, and price of just $200. Its successor — the Honor 8X — has already been revealed in China, but we’ve been waiting for an international release with bated breath. Well, the wait is over. The Honor 8X is now available in select markets, and it’s looking like an incredible budget phone.Here’s everything you need to know about the Honor 8X.The Honor 8X is a seriously stylish-looking smartphone, despite its adoption of a notched display. Honor’s focus this year has been updating the range’s design to a more modern look — and Honor has brought artist Sei Smith and German designer Dieter Rams on board to accomplish this.The Honor 8X is made from 2.5D textured aurora glass over an aluminum frame. This glass back is a first for Honor’s X-range, and is comprised of 15 layers of glass which catches light and refracts it, sending shimmering patterns across the back of the phone. It’s a similar effect to that on the Honor 10, and it’s utterly stunning, whether in black, red, or blue variants. A quarter side of of the glass looks a little more matte, giving off a unique two-tone look. The eye-catching glass back sports a fingerprint sensor in the middle of the frame, with two camera lenses on the top-left. The glass folds neatly into the metal frame, and you’ll find the power and volume keys on the right side of the phone.Flip the phone onto its back and there’s a huge 6.5-inch LCD display with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a maximum resolution of 2,340 x 1,080 pixels. Honor has managed to slim down the bottom chin by bending the display into the frame at the bottom of the phone — a similar process that took out the bottom bezel on the iPhone X. Honor is calling this design the “FullView Display 2.0,” and it claims the Honor 8X sports a huge 91 percent screen-to-body ratio — one of the highest we’ve ever seen on a smartphone.It’s also the first smartphone screen to be certified as having excellent blue-light filtering by TÜV Rheinland. Blue light is suspected to keep you awake at night, and while some of the claims that it causes blindness are unsubstantiated, it’s still something that many people are interested in cutting down on.Finally, Honor has also redesigned the antenna on the Honor 8X to have up to 9-times stronger connectivity, and faster reconnecting after losing network access. Unfortunately there’s no USB-C port, so you’re relying on a MicroUSB port and standard charging speed, but there’s a headphone jack to numb the pain. As we mentioned, the Honor 8X does have a notch — but Honor has confirmed it can be hidden with software, so notch-haters can more easily ignore it.The Honor 8X’s specs are quite close to the Honor Play, but there are some tweaks and improvements that may make the Honor 8X more compelling for bargain hunters.You’re going to find the octa-core Kirin 710 chipset inside the Honor 8X — the same chip that’s in the Huawei Mate 20 Lite. This processor packs four Cortex A73 cores — the same high-power cores you’ll find in the powerful Kirin 970 from the Huawei P20 Pro — while the other four are lower power A53 cores that handle smaller tasks to save power. Honor said the Kirin 710 will pack 75 percent better performance on a single-core, and 68 percent better on multi-core performance.Huawei’s GPU Turbo mode is onboard too, which should boost gaming performance hugely. That hefty processor is backed up by 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and there’s also space for a MicroSD card to expand that memory, along with dual SIM capabilities too.There’s an enormous 3,750mAh battery inside the Honor 8X, and with the four energy-sipping cores inside the Kirin 710, it can probably be expected that the device will make the most of this hefty amount of power. Unfortunately, as we mentioned before, there’s no fast charging on this device, and a MicroUSB port. NFC is included, but it’s currently unknown whether or not this feature will be making its way to U.S. models of the Honor 8X.You’ll find Huawei’s EMUI 5.2 custom Android skin running on the Honor 8X, laid over the top of Android 8.1 Oreo. Android 9.0 Pie might come later, but don’t expect it any time soon.Honor is also including A.I. noise cancelling for phone calls. This software will intelligently identify a caller’s voice and dampen down as much background noise at it can.You’ll find a dual-lens camera set-up on the back of the Honor 8X, and single selfie-shooter around the front. The rear-facing camera suite is comprised of a 20-megapixel main camera lens paired with a secondary 2-megapixel lens that’s used for depth-sensing and “bokeh” background blur. The front-facing camera is alone but not much less powerful — it’s a 16-megapixel monster.The Honor 8X’s camera also benefits from A.I. boosted capabilities. Like many of Honor’s recent phones. the 8X will be able to recognize various categories of scene and apply tweaked settings to match the shot being taken. The Honor 8X will be able to recognize 500 scenarios in 22 different categories, and will even be able to recognize multiple scenes in a photo. The A.I. will also work to keep your image stable, thanks to A.I. image stabilization (AIS) that will also feature heavily in the phone’s Night Mode — a feature ported from the Huawei P20 Pro.It’s not just a great phone for shutterbugs either — the Honor 8X will have support for taking slow motion videos of up to 480 frames-per-second, up to a resolution of 720p.The Honor 8X went on sale in China on September 5 for 1,399 Chinese Yuan, and it will come to a global market on October 2, with prices starting from 999 AED (around $280/235 Euros). It will likely land in the U.S. later this year or early 2019.We’re keen to see if the Honor 8X can live up to its predecessor and claim a place on our best cheap phones list. Stay tuned for a full, in-depth Honor 8X review, which will be coming very soon.Updated October 2, 2018: We’ve added more details coming up to the Honor 8X’s global release."
82,Honor 10,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/honor-10-review/,"The line between budget and premium smartphones continues to blur, when even phones that cost around $200, such as the Motorola Moto G6, have glass bodies and dual-lens cameras. The fight for your dollar gets stronger the more money you have to spend, with Honor being one of the most up front about the incredible value for money its hardware represents. The Honor 10 is its latest phone, and it definitely is one of the hardest to resist when you see the beautiful reflective blue finish on its glass rear panel.We’ve been testing it for a few days, giving us plenty of experience for a strong preliminary review. Here’s how the new Honor 10 stacks up.If you buy a premium smartphone in 2018, it’s going to be made of glass, complete with  reflection, and probably a splash of color too. Just look at the Samsung Galaxy S9, the Huawei P20 Pro, and the LG G7 ThinQ for proof. The Honor 10 continues the trend with a soft-touch glass rear panel, which looks stunning in the phantom blue color. Twist the phone around in the light and the blue changes to purple, with occasional hints of green and flashes of crisp sky blue.The glass curves around the sides, blending into the screen for superb in-hand comfort. Honor gets how to make a phone feel good when you’re holding it, and the Honor 10 has just the right amount of an edge to make it easy to grip. You need this, because the glass body is slippery, and it will make a bid for freedom if you don’t hold on tight. A case is definitely in order. Also, just because the Honor 10 has a glass body, don’t expect wireless charging.Honor has turned to the iPhone X for inspiration on the Honor 10’s size. It’s close to being exactly the same in height and width, and the 5.8-inch screen is identical in size but slightly lower in resolution. It also has a notch containing the front camera and the speaker. If you hate the notch trend, you can hide it using the phone’s software. The Honor 10 displays time, battery, and some connectivity details on the right of the notch, while notifications and network connections live on the left.While the notch itself doesn’t bother us too much, it’s quite deep on the Honor 10, stretching further down into the display than other phones we have seen. At the opposite end of the notch is the fingerprint sensor, which is slim and mounted under glass. It’s not under the screen itself, but still under the single pane of glass covering the display. It’s neat, but it may be a little elusive to find without looking. You’ll also need to hold your finger on it for longer than some other devices to unlock the phone.Twist the phone around in the light and the blue changes to purple.The Honor 10 has a 5.8-inch screen with a 2,280 x 1,080 pixel resolution. While this is an 18:9 aspect ratio, which is commonly associated with bezel-less designs, the bezels on the Honor 10 are quite pronounced. Think of it more like the LG G6, than the Samsung Galaxy S9. Is this a bad thing? Not really, the screen looks great for watching video; but the Honor 10 will no doubt annoy those who dislike a screen notch, especially when it’s accompanied by noticeable bezels and a chin.There’s a 3.5mm headphone jack alongside a USB Type-C charging port, both of which are welcome additions, although the single downward firing speaker is uninspiring. There are some other aspects we don’t like. The AI Camera logo in the top right of the rear panel cheapens the style, looking like a nasty “Stereo Sound” sticker emblazoned on an ‘80s cassette player. Also, when you place the phone down on a hard surface the volume rocker rattles, lessening the premium feel.The Honor 10 is pretty; you’ll catch yourself staring at it for a moment longer than usual. It’s pleasing to hold, and the size is just about right for most hands out there. While it can’t quite reach the build quality we’re used to on phones that cost $800 or more, it comes incredibly close. No-one will be disappointed with the Honor 10.Honor is a sub-brand of Huawei, and there’s some crossover between them, especially on internal components and the software. The Honor 10 has Huawei’s own Kirin 970 processor — seen in the Mate 10 Pro, the P20 Pro, and Honor’s own View 10 — as well as the EMUI 8.1 user interface over Android 8.1 Oreo. Our review Honor 10 has 4GB of RAM, and a sizable 128GB of storage space.Here’s how it performed in our benchmarking tests:These figures are slightly below the Huawei P20 Pro, and considerably lower than the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. However, scores are equal to or better than the OnePlus 5T, a situation repeated with the Honor View 10.Playing a series of games, including Riptide GP2, Reckless Racing 3, and Asphalt Nitro, the phone ran smoothly and gameplay was fun. It’s worth forcing apps to switch to the full screen display — its offered on screen — as controls were sometimes confused without stretching the image.Huawei’s EMUI software will always split opinion, despite the recent improvements to the user interface; it’s far less likely to win new fans on the Honor 10. There is a noticeable lag when opening apps, the app drawer, or navigating around the operating system, due to the app opening animation. It’s just a tiny bit too long, and not always absolutely smooth.Despite having almost the same amount of power as the P20 Pro and View 10, the Honor 10’s performance isn’t quite so sparkling.Once you’re in an app, the phone isn’t slow at all. That initial screen tap will affect a lot of people’s opinion about the Honor 10. We’ve looked for a way to turn off the animation, or lessen its effect, and there is none. We also noted some jerkiness in opening pictures in the gallery, and in certain spots elsewhere. It’s not a deal-breaker, because for the vast majority of the time, the software is not slow at all; but the Honor 10 definitely feels like it could do with some software polish to improve the experience. Honor hasn’t held back on pre-installed apps either, and there’s a variety of game demos and apps like Booking.com.Despite having almost the same amount of power as the P20 Pro and View 10, the Honor 10’s performance isn’t quite so sparkling. Most people may not notice, but hardcore users may get frustrated.It’s a dual-lens f/1.8 aperture camera on the back of the Honor 10, with an 24-megapixel RGB lens and an 16-megapixel monochrome lens, with the latter being able to be used separately for some beautiful, natural black and white photographs. Artificial intelligence plays a big part too, just like it does on the P20 Pro and View 10. Here, it’s apparently clever enough to recognize differences in a scene — it has a library of 22 scenes — such as a blue sky, texture of grass, and so on. It can tune the image on all its aspects, rather than just one.It’s surprisingly effective, with even the most ordinary scenes benefitting from the AI enhancements. A quick photo shot over Brighton beach on a sunny evening shows how much more detail it can reveal. Look at the flowers on the table and the paving, and it doesn’t overpower with a vivid blue sky, or overly blue water. It can still tip over into a hyper real world, as the effect comes close to the strongest HDR filters in third-party apps. Handily, it’s very easy to switch the AI on and off.The interface is the same as the updated EMUI camera app on the P20 Pro, which has been refined for ease of use, and it makes all but one feature easy to access. Annoyingly, Huawei hides the monochrome mode under the More setting, instead of adding it to the main feature bar. The selfie camera has 24-megapixels and a portrait mode, complete with a studio lighting system which replicates what we’ve seen on the P20 Pro, and the iPhone X. The portrait lighting needs some skill, and the right environment to shine; but the bokeh-effect works well with the single selfie camera lens.Amazingly, the Honor 10 squeezes in 80 percent of what made us love the P20 Pro, for half the price, and that’s the kind of math we like. No, it doesn’t have a third camera lens, 5x zoom, slow-mo video, or the astonishing low-light ability; but it’s still a fantastic performer that inspires you to go out and take photos.The Honor 10 has a 3,400mAh battery inside, and it’s a strong performer in our early tests. A day with photos, two 45 minute GPS sessions, and some general use saw around 30 percent remaining in the late evening. When we ran the benchmarks and played some games, the battery reduced from 80 percent down to 44 percent over a couple of hours, and the phone did get quite warm to hold during this period. We’re confident the phone’s battery will run for a day and a half with normal use.The Honor 10 has been announced for the U.K., and parts of Europe, and was recently released in China as the Glory 10. It’s not known if the phone will be released in the U.S., although some Honor phones have been in the past. However, Huawei’s continued problems with selling hardware in the U.S. may impact Honor’s ability to do so as well.It will cost 400 British pounds, or around $540. Honor provides a year’s warranty on its phones in the U.K., with six months on the battery and charger.We’ve fallen for the deliciously-styled, kaleidoscopically-colored Honor 10 because of its enviable camera, and tempting price.The Honor 10 carves itself a very strong niche at the 400 British pound price, undercutting the OnePlus 5T (and forthcoming OnePlus 6), along with its larger sister phone the Honor View 10. The LG G6 can be purchased for around the same amount, and the new Moto G6 Plus is a potential contender too. The HTC U11 Life comes in a little cheaper, and for an even lower price, the Honor 7X and the Nokia 6.1 should be considered. However, the Honor 10’s camera stands apart from the competition, and it’s a strong reason to buy the phone.The well-priced Honor 10 carves itself a very strong niche.It’s made from glass, so it’s quite slippery, and it’s not water-resistant — you best be careful if you want the Honor 10 to last. Huawei doesn’t always have the best track record with software updates either, and it’s only just up to date now — Android 8.1 and the April 2018 security patch — which means if you want Android P promptly later this year, the Honor 10 may not be for you.If you’re not worried about this, and will use a case, the Honor 10 will last at least two years before you’d need to contemplate an upgrade.Yes. The camera is top-notch, the body is a beauty, and the price is incredibly tempting. The software and performance issues are minimal, and unless you’re coming from much more powerful hardware, may not even be noticeable."
83,HTC U12+,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/htc-u12-life-review/,"Things are not going well for HTC’s mobile division. The buttonless design of the HTC U12 Plus was a flop and poor sales in general have led to layoffs. The innovative Android pioneer is on the ropes and in need of a hit. We loved last year’s HTC U11 Life, which distilled its flagship sibling’s features into a more affordable package, but the HTC U12 Life is a different beast altogether.This midrange offering comes in at £300 in the U.K. or 350 Euros in Europe (around $350) but won’t get an official U.S. release. It bears little relation to the U12 Plus, which is probably a good thing. With an interesting stripy design, big screen and battery, and a tempting price, is there room for the U12 Life to break off a piece of the increasingly competitive midrange market? We think there is, but it will have to beat contenders like the Nokia 7.1 and Motorola One for your affection.As manufacturers continue to wage war on the bezel, HTC has lagged behind a little, resisting the notch and retaining edges above and below the screen. The U12 Life has a decent screen-to-body ratio with its 6-inch display taking up almost 80 percent of the front. There’s also a front-facing speaker in the top bezel with the selfie camera to the left.When you flip the U12 Life over, things get a bit more interesting as the generic frontage gives way to a shiny plastic design that HTC calls acrylic glass. Our review unit is purple, but it comes in blue as well. There’s a two-tone pattern, a bit like Google’s Pixel phones, with a shiny top portion that houses a dual-lens camera module at the top left and a fingerprint sensor in the middle.A distinctive, stripy, textured finish covers the bottom two thirds of the U12 Life. It makes the phone a little easier to grip, though it doesn’t extend around the sides, but the main benefit is that it doesn’t show finger smudges and smears like the shiny top portion does.It bears little relation to the U12 Plus, which is probably a good thing.On the left side you’ll find the SIM card tray with room for a MicroSD card. On the right there’s the volume rocker with a textured power button further down. The bottom edge is home to the USB-C port and the bottom-firing speaker. There’s a surprise up top in the shape of a 3.5mm audio jack, which is something HTC has not offered in its last few phones.It’s a good-looking phone, but it feels a bit chunky and unmistakably plastic in hand. It seems slightly odd that the fingerprint sensor sits in the shiny section at the top because that leads inevitably to unsightly finger smudges. We assume that’s why Google shrank the shiny section down in the Pixel 2 and 3, placing the fingerprint sensor in the matte portion instead.The design is nice, but midrange and even budget phones have grown leaps and bounds over the last year, often echoing the glass designs and notched displays of their more expensive contemporaries. We think there are more eye-catching and expensive-feeling phones in this price bracket – the Nokia 7.1 immediately springs to mind, for example.Digital buttons and squeezable sides are nowhere to be found in the U12 Life and water resistance has gone along with them. We really disliked the digital buttons of the U12 Plus, so we’re not disappointed by that, but we think Edge Sense is useful and the lack of any IP rating feels like a step backwards – last year’s U11 Life had both.We’re pleased to find stereo speakers in the U12 Life, but they aren’t good enough to get the Boomsound label and the volume is limited. Headphones are always superior and we’re sure that some people will be happy to see the return of the 3.5mm audio jack.The 6-inch display is a good size for watching movies and gaming, but it’s not the best quality.The 6-inch display is a good size for watching movies and gaming, but it’s not the best quality. The 18:9 aspect ratio is fine and the resolution of 2,160 x 1,080, which translates to 402 pixels-per-inch is plenty sharp enough, but it doesn’t always get bright enough. If you adjust the brightness it just switches auto-brightness off altogether, so you can’t set your preferred levels which we found annoying.The colors and contrast are good, and you have to accept that you’re not going to get OLED at this price. The screen in the Nokia 7.1 looks similar on paper, but it boasts an important extra that the U12 Life lacks in the shape of HDR10 support. If you watch a lot of Netflix movies or other HDR content this is quite an important difference and it makes the Nokia (which is sold in the U.S.) a much more attractive prospect.The HTC U12 Life has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor with 4GB of RAM. There’s 64GB of storage, with just shy of 50GB usable out of the box, and a MicroSD card slot for expansion.Those specs are exactly the same as one of its biggest competitors: The Nokia 7.1, which we just named our top budget phone.If we look at the benchmarks, the U12 Life actually comes out slightly ahead, but in real life we encountered occasional issues with slow loading and stuttering, especially in the camera app. (The AnTuTu benchmark is missing as the app refused to install on our unit.)The HTC U12 Life is generally fast and responsive. These results are about what you’d expect based on the hardware, and most of the time the U12 Life served us well.We played games like Project Highrise and Asphalt 9 without any issues, web browsing was smooth, but we encountered occasional lag swapping in and out of apps, and some apps took longer to load than they should have.The HTC U12 Life runs Android 8.1 Oreo with HTC’s Sense user interface on top. Swipe left to right and you get BlinkFeed, which is HTC’s aggregated news feed. We don’t find it very useful, but thankfully it’s easy to remove.TouchPal is also installed as the default keyboard and there are all sorts of themes you can choose from if you want to customize your home screens. We find HTC’s software a bit spammy, with a few too many notifications and suggestions popping up and some unnecessary apps preinstalled.The contrast with the Nokia 7.1, which is an Android One phone that’s free of bloatware, is stark. Not only does the Nokia feel snappier, it’s also sure to get the Android 9 Pie update sooner than the U12 Life, and it’s guaranteed fast version updates for two years, and security updates for three years. If the U12 Life was an Android One phone it would be easier to recommend.You’ll find a dual-lens main camera in the HTC U12 Life, which pairs a 12-megapixel main lens with an f/2.0 aperture and a 5-megapixel secondary lens. This combination enables it to achieve a decent bokeh effect with blurred backgrounds for portrait shots.Using the camera with the automatic settings, we found it took decent photos in good lighting conditions, but the quality deteriorated rapidly as the light began to fade. You have to hold still and wait to get a decent shot. Movement tends to result in a bit of blurring. Overexposure is also a problem, especially in mixed lighting.HDR is off by default and as soon as you turn it on the camera becomes relatively slow to snap a shot, and very slow to process. We actually thought it had frozen as it took so long to process one shot. Ordinarily we’d suggest you want HDR turned on all the time, but it’s not just the slow processing you have to worry about here.We think there are issues with the camera app and software tuning. If you look at these two shots, you can see the brighter one has HDR turned on. It seems to be a bit too aggressive, losing contrast, and making scenes appear much brighter across the board than they actually were.Detail levels and color accuracy are good for a midrange device, you just need a steady hand and proper light to get the most from it. Expect grain to creep in the minute the sun goes down.We were pleasantly surprised by the portrait mode in the U12 Life. It takes a little fiddling and it’s not especially fast, with warnings that flash up if you’re too close or far from your subject, but persist and you can get some lovely photos. If you crave those DSLR-like blurred backgrounds then you can get them with this camera, but if you look closely, you’ll see it does occasionally mess up at the edges.It’s a mixed bag all-in-all in the camera department. If HTC could roll out a software fix for the HDR to tweak the tuning and speed it up a bit that would be great, but as it stands there are flaws here.For anyone suffering from battery anxiety, the HTC U12 Life is going to soothe those nerves. It packs a 3,600mAh battery which will easily see you through a busy day. Even with an extended gaming session we found the U12 Life had a little left in the tank at bedtime. An average day of mixed use should leave you with 30 to 40 percent by the end of the day.For anyone suffering from battery anxiety, the HTC U12 Life is going to soothe those nerves.There’s no real fast charging here. It charged from 10 percent to 43 percent in 30 minutes with the charger and cable supplied in the box. It took a little over an hour and half to hit 100 percent. You won’t find any support for wireless charging either, which is par for the course in the midrange market.The HTC U12 Life costs £300 in the U.K. and 350 Euros on the continent where it’s widely available. It would probably be $350 stateside, but HTC sadly has no plans to launch this phone in the U.S. You could always buy one direct from HTC, but it won’t work with Verizon or Sprint.HTC offers a standard one-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects.The HTC U12 Life is a solid midrange smartphone with a lot to offer. It’s definitely a step up from midrange mediocrity, but there are compromises here. We like the design, the large screen, and the long battery life, but it’s let down by flaws in the software.Yes, we think the Nokia 7.1 is a better phone. The uncluttered software, the quality of the build, and the slightly superior display and camera add up to an overall better device.You might also consider the Android One version of the Moto X4, or the Moto G6 Plus if you’re in the U.K. They don’t quite match the U12 Life in all areas, but they are both a bit cheaper.You can expect to get two years out of the HTC U12 Life. The plastic body of the U12 Life is going to be more durable than glass, but it does lack an IP rating for water resistance, and you’ll probably want a case to protect the glass front.We wish HTC had stuck with Android One which would have guaranteed security updates for three years, and at least two Android version upgrades. As it stands, we think the U12 Life will get Android 9 Pie, but we’re not overly optimistic about software updates for this phone beyond that.If you love the design and a big screen and battery are priorities for you, then you should go ahead and buy the HTC U12 Life. Most people should buy the Nokia 7.1 instead."
84,Huawei Mate 20,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/huawei-mate-20-review/,"Ron Howard and Clint Howard. Alec Baldwin and Stephen, Daniel, and William Baldwin. Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal. The list of celebrities with slightly less famous siblings goes on for ages. The Huawei Mate 20 Pro captured headlines and hearts this year, and it was also joined by the Huawei Mate 20, which could similarly be seen as its less-famous sibling.We’ve now spent some more time with the Mate 20, and it may just be one of the unsung hero phones of 2018.The most striking difference between the Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro is the screen and its tiny, and dare we say it, attractive, notch. That’s right, as notches go, the Mate 20’s is a beauty. It’s a teardrop notch, just like we’ve seen and appreciated on the Essential Phone and the OnePlus 6T. It takes up less room than the full size notch on the Mate 20 Pro, and after the Pixel 3 XL’s notch, which is deeper than some oceans, it appears positively petite.This means more space for notification icons, and a greater sense of a bezel-less display. Huawei has done an astonishing job of minimizing the rest of the bezels on the Mate 20 too. There is still a chin bezel, which is very small and hardly noticeable. The speaker grill is built into the top of the phone, and you have to look hard to spot it. This is one super looking phone.Looked at face on, when the device is nestling in your palm, the Mate 20’s expanse of screen provides a wonderful window into your media. We loved zooming in on photos, just to see them fill up the entirety of the display. Flip over the phone and the Mate 20 comes in the Hyper Optical green seen on our Mate 20 Pro, a twilight gradient finish to brighten things up, or a super shiny gloss black. There’s a textured sleep/wake key on the metal chassis, and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top, something the Pro does not have.This is one super looking phone.It also has a traditional aspect ratio, making the phone look and feel more “phone shaped,” than the longer and thinner Pro. It’s 77mm wide compared to the 72mm wide Pro, but is almost exactly the same length and thickness. Overall, the Mate 20 is the same physical size as the Apple iPhone XS Max. The other distinct change is the fingerprint sensor. It’s on the back here, below the camera lenses, instead of in the screen. It works as you’d expect — reliably and quickly. We prefer it to the Mate 20 Pro’s in-screen sensor.The Mate 20 does not have the 3D-sensing front facing camera setup. It still has face unlock, but it’s not suitable for secure payment use. It was also less reliable than previous Huawei phones, and not as fast as the OnePlus 6T. A further disappointment is the lower water and dust resistance. The Mate 20 has an IP54 rating, compared to the Mate 20 Pro’s IP68, making it less durable.The Mate 20 isn’t as eye-catching as the Mate 20 Pro, and it won’t stand out in a crowd especially in the black color. However, we love the size of the screen, the teardrop notch, and the tiny bezels.The Mate 20’s screen measures 6.5-inches and has a 2,244 x 1,080 pixel resolution, for a 381 pixel-per-inch density. It’s an LCD screen that’s a little larger than the OLED on the Mate 20 Pro. The use of LCD is not a massive downside, but put it next to the Mate 20 Pro and the improved blacks, deep contrast levels, and stunning colors seen on the OLED screen are immediately obvious.You won’t get tired of looking at the Mate 20’s screen.This doesn’t mean the Mate 20’s LCD is ugly though. It still looks great, especially for YouTube and Netflix; you won’t get tired of looking at the Mate 20’s screen. It just won’t play the higher resolution videos you can enjoy on the Mate 20 Pro’s 3,120 x 1,440 pixel OLED.Huawei has treated the Mate 20 to an excellent array of audio options. The 3.5mm headphone jack is becoming a rarity, but even though it’s included here, the Bluetooth connection hasn’t been forgotten — it’s Bluetooth 5.0, and AptX HD too, plus there is Dolby Atmos to tune the sound. It’s effective depending on the content, but does reduce overall volume, and the Mate 20 isn’t the loudest smartphone we’ve heard. We tested it with Audio Technica’s wonderful ATH-M50xBT, wired and wirelessly, and enjoyed listening.The Mate 20 is driven by the Kirin 980 processor, built on a 7nm process, and accompanied by Huawei’s dual-NPU neural processing unit, which takes care of artificial intelligence features onboard the phone. Our review phone has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage space, but a 4GB/128GB model is also available, along with a dual-SIM Mate 20.We’re expecting the performance to be the same as the Mate 20 Pro, as they both have the same internal specifications, so we ran some benchmarks to establish that.These figures are mostly higher than the Mate 20 Pro achieved, but we wouldn’t read too much into that, and instead consider the two phones equal in terms of power and performance. It has also been that way in our tests, and everything we’ve asked the Mate 20 to do, it has completed without a problem. It mostly surpasses the Pixel 3 and the OnePlus 6T, in all but AnTuTu.It’s a great gaming machine too. We’ve played Hitman Sniper for hours on the Mate 20, and it never gets uncomfortable to hold, and doesn’t get overly hot. We never saw any slowdown or poor frame rates when playing Reckless Racing 3. In general, everyday use, the Mate 20 is a solid, speedy companion.The Mate 20 comes with Android 9.0 Pie and the latest EMUI 9.0 user interface. Our review model has the October 2018 security patch installed. EMUI 9.0 has been heavily revised over EMUI 8.0, resulting in a 47 percent increase in system response, a 42 percent increase in app smoothness, and a 51 percent improvement in how quickly it opens apps. The settings menus have also been revised, with fewer, more logical options. Huawei has added its own Digital Wellbeing system, called Digital Balance, and a new gesture control system.Like Apple’s iOS, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to return to the main home screen, swipe up and pause for the open app menu, and gently swipe on the side of the screen to go back a step. This is joined by a cute, springy arrow animation confirming it understands what you’re trying to do. The gesture controls are generally effective, slicker than the OxygenOS option on the OnePlus 6T, and we didn’t feel the need to return to the standard Android controls. However, the option is there, so you’re not forced to use them.If you don’t quite like the way it is out the box, there’s a good chance it can be altered.Using the Mate 20 is the same as the Mate 20 Pro, and many of the frustrations are repeated. Hateful SwiftKey is still the default keyboard, the notifications are still poor — too few ways to interact with them outside entering the app — and it’s not as clean and fuss-free as Android on a Google Pixel 3. Setting EMUI 9.0 up in detail pays off in the long run. It has plenty of options — from the color tone of the screen to whether you want an app tray or not — so if you don’t quite like the way it is out the box, there’s a good chance it can be altered.Niggles aside, it is considerably better than it was before, and Huawei does listen to feedback, so it’ll continue to improve. There are aspects we really like, such as Digital Balance which provides greater insight than Google’s Digital Wellbeing, and is arguably easier to use too. EMUI is not as instantly usable as other user interfaces, and requires some patience to learn and tweak.The Mate 20 has a three-lens camera on the back, set inside a square-shaped module with curved corners. At first, this looks unusual, but it gets better with time. It’s shockingly neat, and we love the way the edges curve at the same angle as the edge of the phone — this gives it a softer, more coherent look.While the cameras look the same on the outside, there are some differences inside. The Mate 20’s main camera has 12 megapixels and an f/1.8 aperture, the ultra-wide-angle has 16 megapixels and an f/2.2 aperture, both of which are lower than the 40 megapixel and 20 megapixel lenses on the Pro. The 8-megapixel, f/2.4 aperture telephoto lens is the same on both phones, as is the 24-megapixel, f/2.0 selfie cam. It provides a 2x zoom, but not the 5x on the Mate 20 Pro.The new wide-angle lens works brilliantly in conjunction with Huawei’s artificial intelligence system, driven by the dual-NPU inside the Kirin 980 processor. The camera understands what it sees, and recommends switching to a wide-angle view if it thinks the photo would be improved. Crucially, it just offers up a button, rather than forcing a change, giving you the choice. Switching between lenses normally is cumbersome and confusing though. It’s performed using the zoom button, and the ultra-wide shows up under a meaningless 0.6x setting, after cycling through 1x and 2x. Then, when the A.I. recommends a change, a button for Standard or Wide appears. We’d prefer this to be consistent across the UI, and for a more obvious button to activate the wide-angle lens.As we’ve come to expect from Huawei, photos are excellent, but they can’t match the Mate 20 Pro, or the P20 Pro. They both reign supreme, but the Mate 20 is very close behind. Where it struggles is in challenging daytime light, and we found switching to Night Mode — which leaves the shutter open for a few seconds and stabilizes the image using artificial intelligence — was a necessity rather than a creative alternative. At night, the Mate 20 still delivers though, taking detailed photos without blur, and in sunny conditions the results are always excellent. The app is easy to use, if a little complex, and the editing suite is comprehensive. However, this only applies to stills, and video editing is almost non-existent.The app is easy to use, if a little complex, and the editing suite is comprehensive.This is a shame, because for the Mate 20, Huawei has employed its A.I. to enhance video, and there are some new A.I. Cinema modes to play with. The Kirin 980’s dual-NPU allows the camera to change the background in real-time while shooting. The filters are fine, but they drastically alter the look of the video, and with only three modes, it’s slightly creatively limiting. Suspense mode, for example, is very dark.The most noticeable effect comes when you isolate a person in color, while making the background black and white. There’s also a live bokeh mode for video. It works well, but it doesn’t recognize objects, only people. It’s not faultless, and the bokeh mode shows shimmer around the focal point when the A.I. gets confused, and the color mode sometimes loses the colour when the person moves around. We also noticed the camera would hunt for focus problems when shooting video, especially through windows, and when using the AI modes.We liked the Mate 20’s camera a lot, but it’s clearly the lesser sibling to the Mate 20 Pro in this department. The video modes need improvement for them to be anything more than novelties too.The Mate 20 has a 4,000mAh battery inside with fast charging using the proprietary Huawei SuperCharge system for almost 60 percent charge in 30 minutes. What’s more, the Kirin 980’s improved power efficiency means the battery life easily reaches two days, and with careful use on the second day, we saw the phone spill over into a third day without charging, which is very special by today’s standards.It does not have the wireless charging tech seen on the Mate 20 Pro, and does not have the even faster 40w SuperCharge technology.Prepare for disappointment, as the Mate 20 — like the Mate 20 Pro — is not available in the U.S.. The phone is currently available in Europe, where the 4GB/64GB model costs 800 euros, or about $920, and the 6GB/128GB model is 850 euros, or about $980. In the U.K. the 4GB/128GB Mate 20 can be purchased through John Lewis for 700 British pounds. Huawei’s usual warranty in the U.K. lasts for two years, and covers defects in the device, while the charger and the battery are only covered for six months.The Mate 20 lives in the shadow of the Mate 20 Pro, but this doesn’t mean it’s not worthy of consideration. We prefer the traditional fingerprint sensor, and love the minimal bezels and tiny notch, but the camera and design can’t match the Pro.Great smartphones around the same price as the Huawei Mate 20 are not a rarity, and because this year has been so good for high-end phones, they’re all strong contenders. The iPhone XS, the Google Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, and the OnePlus 6T are all excellent, and officially available in the U.S., while those in the U.K. or Europe should also consider spending a little more to get the Huawei Mate 20 Pro.We’ve mentioned the Mate 20’s lesser water and dust resistance, and at the price, this is a disappointment. It’s also less, “futuristic,” than the Mate 20 Pro in terms of design and technology — from the in-display fingerprint sensor to the wireless charging —which means it may be less appealing after a year. It has plenty of power though, and provided you choose the 128GB version, there’s plenty of storage space too.Software is up-to-date at the moment, but Huawei won’t be the fastest at updating to the next version of Android, however it will deliver its own software updates on a regular basis. You can purchase the Huawei Mate 20 safe in the knowledge it’ll last for two years at the absolute minimum.Yes, if the Mate 20 is available where you live, then it’s a good purchase. Perhaps the more pertinent question is whether you should buy it over the Mate 20 Pro? If you are happy to pay out for the Mate 20 Pro, then the advantages and additional features are worth the extra, but if the Mate 20 is the only one in your price range, it’s a strong enough device that you won’t feel like you’re going to be lumped with the less-famous, less capable sibling."
85,Huawei Mediapad M5,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-tablets-for-small-businesses/,"A tablet can become a powerful tool for your small business. A tablet’s large screen is ideal for demos, graphs, and images, while the portable design often makes it more convenient than a laptop. If you’re often on the go and need a large screen to share information with employees or clients, a tablet could be the ideal choice for you.Before investing in a tablet, it is a good idea to look at what features it offers and whether those features are necessary for your business.  The best tablets for small businesses should enhance connectivity and portability, deliver the kind of performance you need, and remain affordable.When you start shopping for a tablet for yourself and your team, don’t be mesmerized by all the flashy products that are available. You’ll be happier with your purchase and it will serve you better if you set a few parameters before you start looking. Determine what will be the primary use of the device, how much you are willing to spend on each tablet, which operating system syncs well with your other computer systems and smartphones, and which features and specs mean the most to you.Companies can use tablets for all kinds of operations including payment processing, fieldwork, and media consumption. You may also want to differentiate between executives and employees who need different types of tablets for their differing roles in the company (primary versus supplementary, or even rugged devices, depending on the worksite). Also consider size, battery life, processor, storage, and external ports for accessories.Businesses will have different uses for tablets. Here are some features to take into account:Storage: If your business generates a lot of documents, photos, videos, and multimedia assets that you want to keep with you (with or without cloud backup) make sure you buy a tablet that has adequate storage for your needs. Storage is available anywhere from 16GB all the way up to 1TB.Battery life: Battery capacity can vary quite a bit depending on the size of the device, but you’re generally looking at between 6,000mAh and 8,000mAh, sometimes dipping into the 3,000mAh range for smaller devices. If battery life is important to you, then read some reviews and get an idea of how the capacity translates into hours of real-world usage.Cameras: Tablet cameras are generally considered more of a convenience than a vital feature. Nonetheless, most tablets come equipped with front and rear cameras that may prove useful depending on your needs. Front-facing cameras are handy for video conferencing and video chats via Skype, FaceTime, and other services. Rear cameras may be useful for scanning documents.Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi comes standard for all tablets and most support the fastest Wi-Fi standards available at the time of purchase — the 802.11ac standard, even if your office has an older router.Processor: Tablet processors vary widely and are sometimes specific to the manufacturer, such as Apple’s iPad A12X chip. You might check out the processor online to see how fast it is and how it compares with others.Speakers: Tablet speakers are utilitarian as opposed to premium, but subpar audio can seriously mar the tablet experience. Make sure that the sound quality is decent when you check out the reviews of tablets you’re considering, or better still go to a store like Best Buy, which may have a few demo tablets out and listen for yourself. If you play music, get one with speakers on either side for optimal sound separation.Stylus: Styluses and tablets go together and certain tablets have styluses that are made especially for them to take advantage of their hardware and software features. If you need one, get a stylus that’s custom-designed for your tablet. Many support multiple pen types that let you switch between thick pen strokes and thin ones with the click of a button.Expandable memory: Some tablets include SD card slots, a handy feature that lets you add storage space as needed.LTE connection: When you’re out in the field, you may not want to use available Wi-Fi for online communications. LTE connectivity can get you online anywhere. You’ll need to add your tablet to your mobile data subscription plan from a wireless provider to get everything up and running.Once you’ve got a shortlist of requirements, feel free to go crazy evaluating various models that meet the needs of your company. Here are a few we recommend and check out our list of the best tablets on the market today.Although you could go for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 with its 10.5-inch super AMOLED screen and Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, we prefer the Galaxy Tab S7 as a workhorse. With its larger 11-inch screen — LCD rather than Super AMOLED — it’s ideal for attaching Samsung’s keyboard cover and getting some serious work done, even if its screen isn’t as great as the Tab S6 for media streaming. Boasting the same flagship processor as its predecessor and a 2560 x 1600 resolution, the  comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or 8GB of RAM and 256GB or 512GB of storage, as well as an included S Pen for taking and editing notes for work. The Tab S7 is also 5G enabled — great for video calls or working on the go — with an 8,000mAh battery and 45W fast charging.The Lenovo Chromebook Duet detachable tablet offers 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a MediaTek Helio P60T processor for an incredible price. We love the tablet’s distinctive look with its dual-tone Ice Blue and Iron Grey design and fabric texture — but it’s not all about looks. The  features an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 2MP front-facing camera, and a 10.1-inch, 1920 x 1200-pixel display.It has a 7,000 mAh battery life, offering around 10 hours of runtime, so it should get you through an average day. It’s fast to boot up in around eight seconds, and the detachable keyboard is comfortable to type on. The only issue is that no pen is included. But don’t let this stop you. You can pick up a USI pen from Lenovo for $32.99. If you’re looking for something that can operate as a laptop or tablet, this is a good choice, but it’s ideally suited for businesses working primarily off of Google Services. Pick one up right now and you’ll get a free 12-month Google One membership, which gives you 100GB of storage.Read our full Lenovo Chromebook Duet review.Even if you’re not a Mac user, the Apple iPad Pro is one of the best tablets available, especially since the M1 update with Apple’s own speedy processor. Apple’s lineup offers a sweet selection of iPads, including the two iPad Pro models at 12.9 and 11 inches. The 11-inch model is our pick, with its Liquid Retina IPS screen and 2388 x 1668 pixel resolution. Besides being ideal for watching videos, iOS multitasking features, and offering battery life of up to 10 hours, its productivity apps make the iPad Pro an ideal business companion. With iPadOS 13.4 installed, this iPad Pro comes closer than ever before to becoming a laptop alternative.Both models have comparable specs and are available with storage of 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. The 11-inch model weighs 471 grams and features Apple’s M1 and 8-core graphics processor — making it more powerful than most laptops. There’s a dual camera on the back — a 12MP main sensor and a 10MP wide-angle lens.You also get Smart HDR, 4K video recording at up to 60 fps, five microphones, and a lidar sensor for measuring distances — and there’s a 7-megapixel TrueDepth front camera with Face Unlock, too. The  offers Wi‑Fi (802.11ax Wi-Fi 6), Bluetooth 5.0, 5G, Face ID, and Apple Pay. You can also opt for a cellular connection. Apple’s companion hardware, available separately, includes the Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil, AirPods, and more.Read our full iPad Pro (2021) review.The MediaPad M5 Pro is Huawei’s challenge to the iPad. It has a gorgeous 10.8-inch, 2560 x 1600 curved-edge 2.5D glass display. Its 82% screen-to-body ratio features a wide view, augmented by a curved metal body that offers an elegant, attractive, and simple industrial design. It has a proprietary Kirin 960 series octa-core chipset and stable Wi-Fi network connectivity with quad stereo speakers tuned and certified by Harman Kardon for an excellent audio and video experience with headphones.The 13MP rear camera combined with the 8-megapixel front camera offers all the photographic capabilities you need for most tablets. It packs 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and even includes an M Pen. Its 7,500 mAh battery and power-saving technology allow for 11 hours of 1080P video viewing. With the built-in Quick Charge, the Huawei MediaPad M5 Pro takes about 2.9 hours to fully charge the device. It also features Smart UI EMUI 8.0 (Android 8.0) and advanced fingerprint recognition.Read our full Huawei MediaPad M5 Pro review.Even though Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 two-in-one computer tablet is not radically different from its predecessor, our previous favorite, the Surface Pro 6, there’s plenty of overall improvement in the newer model to recommend it as a great business tablet. It offers everything you need for workplace versatility — both in the office or while traveling. The Surface Pro 7 features the new Intel 10th-generation Ice Lake processor with three options, starting with the dual-core Core i3-1005G1. The screen is crisp and color accurate at 2736 x 1824 resolution on a 12.3-inch screen — with equal pixel density as the iPad Pro, making it a great display for video watching as well as working.With this model, Microsoft has swapped its mini-DisplayPort for USB-C. Because few monitors include mini-DisplayPort anymore, this USB-C could require fewer dongles and cables since the new port handles power delivery, video output, and data transfer simultaneously.While the bezels may be too large for some users, they include components like the Windows Hello IR camera, the 1080p webcam, and a pair of 1.6-watt stereo speakers. The Microsoft Surface Pro 7 comes in seven main configurations, including the Intel 4 i3 with 4GB RAM, three Intel Core i5 models with 8GB and 16GB RAM, and storage from 128GB to 256GB, and the Intel Core i7 models with 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB of storage. Prices range from $729 to $2300. It comes in Black and Platinum.Read our full Microsoft Surface Pro 7 review.Some small companies use their tablets for almost everything, and even substitute them for laptops when on the road or working at home, but others will have fewer needs and more limited budgets. The Amazon Fire HD 10 serves nicely with a 10.1-inch LCD at 224 pixels per inch. With it, you can see any document, video, or image at a wide viewing angle — bright but without glare. It’s an Android tablet, but it runs Amazon’s tweaked version, called Fire OS, so it doesn’t have full access to the Google Play Store, limiting the number of third-party apps and games available. The Fire HD 10 comes packed with 32GB or 64GB of storage and you can expand the storage with a separate MicroSD card. The Fire HD 10 features a 2MP rear-facing camera for shooting photos or 720p video and a 2MP front-facing VGA camera that works fine for Skype conference calls.With up to 12 hours of mixed-use battery life, the Amazon Fire HD 10 gives you more flexibility and is compatible with Alexa for quick access to information, your calendar, and your smart office. Show Mode delivers a hands-free Alexa experience with a home screen that’s optimized for visibility across the room, in addition to Alexa calling and messaging. The Amazon Fire HD 10 is an economy purchase, but it does lock you into Amazon’s limited app store and it lacks high-end processing power.Read our full Amazon Fire HD 10 review.While the iPad Pro can make for an excellent, powerful tablet that serves as a laptop replacement when needed, it may be too bulky and expensive for many users. Those who want a more portable tablet option while sticking to a stricter budget should consider the standard iPad.This 2020 model still offers plenty of performance with its Apple A12 Bionic chip, and the 10.2-inch is easy to handle while still providing an excellent display. Storage options are a little low at either 32GB or 128GB, but that’s less of a concern in many workplaces where cloud storage and other options are readily available.The iPad 2020 model also offers an 8MP back camera, a high-capacity battery that can last throughout the day, and up to 500 nits of brightness for working in sunny conditions. There are some minor compromises — this iPad still includes the circular Touch ID/Home button that Apple has largely discarded on all other devices — but it’s still very good at what it does.Read our full iPad (2020) review.The iPad Pro 12.9 (2021) is one of the most popular tablets for businesses. Apple has made some huge strides in its tablets in recent years, making big upgrades to iPadOS, and closing the gap between laptops and tablets. A massive 9,720mAh battery with 18W charging and 128GB/256GB/1TB/2TB storage options are only the start of what makes the top-level iPad Pro one of the best business tablets to grab. Apple’s new M1 processor means it has as much power as a MacBook, and the stunning display and Magic Keyboard mean it’s a serious MacBook challenger in the office.Business tablets tend to have faster processing, more generous storage space, and longer runtimes with fast charging. For example, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, 8,000mAh battery with 45W charging, and 128GB and 256GB storage expandable up to 1TB. This extra power means you’re unlikely to be left waiting when you absolutely need a bit of power behind you. Another obvious advantage is portability. If you access a lot of important files on the go, using a business tablet can make your everyday operations much easier.Look at your primary needs. Do you browse a lot? Then consider devices like the Amazon Fire HD 10 (2021) that offer plenty of basic features at an affordable price. You get 32GB of storage with a 1080p Full HD screen at a starting price of $149.99. If you perform a lot of heavy operations like editing long videos, consider tablets with good battery life and at least decent, if not super-fast processing power. The Microsoft Surface Pro X and the Apple iPad Pro can be great options in this category. Identify your must-have features and see which devices in your price range offer great performance in these areas."
86,Huawei P20,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/common-huawei-p20-pro-problems-and-how-to-fix-them/,"It might be an older phone now, but the Huawei P20 Pro is still sure to impress. It has an eye-catching design, a long-lasting battery, and still one of the best cameras we’ve ever encountered on a smartphone. But as impressive as it is, this phone is not perfect, and we’re not just talking about the fact that it isn’t on sale in the U.S.We’ve gathered together some of the most commonly reported Huawei P20 Pro problems for you here, and we’re offering up workarounds and potential fixes to help you get your issues sorted out.As a flagship phone, the Huawei P20 Pro was entitled to a number of software updates for a couple of years following its release. EMUI 9.1 (under Android 10) is included in that, but many users may wish it wasn’t. Some have noticed the Google Play Store has disappeared from their devices, seemingly having been hidden from view.Problem is, this isn’t a bug. Due to Huawei’s ongoing issues with the U.S., Huawei is not allowed to use Google’s services — which means no Play Store, no Google Maps, and none of Google’s other services.Unfortunately, that means there’s no solution to this particular problem, as it’s not a bug or a problem that can be fixed. However, that doesn’t mean you’re without access to new apps. Huawei’s own App Gallery might not be as large as the Google Play Store, but it’s packed with enough favorites that you shouldn’t miss the Play Store too much.Quite a few people have found that the fingerprint sensor on their P20 Pro has stopped working. We’ve seen threads about the issue on the XDA Developer forum and Reddit, among other places. For most people, it seems to be unresponsive, but others have also noted the sensor heating up and the fingerprint sensor options in the Settings menu becoming inaccessible.Possible fixes:A few people have run into an issue with push notifications, whether it’s a new message from WhatsApp or an incoming email from Outlook, not working as they should. When the P20 Pro is in standby, with the screen off, the notifications seem to stop and then they flood in when the phone is picked up and unlocked again. There’s a thread about it at the XDA Developers forum. This is likely due to Settings on your P20 Pro, and it’s easy to fix.Possible fixes:There are a couple of threads on the XDA Developers forum that mention unprompted reboots. For one person, it was happening repeatedly in the Gallery app, but for others, it seems to be a bit more random when it occurs. The P20 Pro will suddenly shut down and restart itself with no apparent cause. This is an issue we’ve seen from time to time on a lot of different phones.Possible fixes:In our opinion, one of the most impressive qualities of the Huawei P20 Pro is its extensive battery life. The device features a 4,000mAh battery, which can comfortably last you an entire day, or potentially two days between charges. That said, several users have reported issues through the XDA Developers forum and Android Central forum regarding poor battery life. The battery’s size is large; You shouldn’t have to troubleshoot or work around the issue too much, but we have a few ideas just in case. We also have a couple of ideas if you’re looking for a more permanent solution.Workarounds:Potential fixes:While scanning the XDA Developers forum, we spotted several complaints about touchscreen issues and lagging displays— most notably when users are trying to scroll or complete precise actions on their screen.Potential fixes:Workarounds:Huawei’s SuperCharge system boasts that it can bring one of its massive batteries from empty to fully-charged in roughly 90 minutes. However, several users haven’t been able to successfully speed-charge their device. The reports were found in several threads on the XDA Developers forum.Potential fixes:Several people have discovered their microphone on the Huawei P20 appears to go in and out while recording. Many reports of this issue were seen in threads on the XDA Developers forum; They say the glitch was most noticeable while trying to make a call and while trying to leave audio and video messages.Workarounds:Possible fix:"
87,IPhone XR,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xr-review/,"Editor’s note: Apple has released the iPhone 12, which is now available for purchase. The iPhone 12 is successor to the iPhone 11, which is itself the successor to the iPhone XR. It improves camera quality and performance, but comes at a slightly higher $799 MSRP. We don’t recommend buying the iPhone XR anymore. Instead, if you want to save money, consider buying an iPhone 11, or the $400 iPhone SE. Here’s our list of the best iPhones you can buy. The iPhone XR is the best iPhone of the year. Yes, the iPhone XS and XS Max have better screens and more versatile cameras, but neither of them look as gorgeous as the XR in yellow, blue, or coral. The iPhone XR (pronounced “ten-R”) is also significantly more affordable and carries many of the best features from the flagships. It’s an unquestionably superb value at $750.We can’t stop holding the iPhone XR the wrong way ‘round. Sure, the screen is a window to our apps and notifications, but it’s the brilliant, bright yellow color on the back that makes us smile every time we pull this phone out of our pocket. We feel like Gollum, constantly admiring the beauty of the one ring. It’s perfection.If you’re buying the iPhone XR — and you should — we can’t fathom the idea of going for the black or white colors. For the first time since the iPhone 5C, you’re getting rich, colorful choices from Apple — red, blue, yellow, and coral, on top of black and white. This is a phone you’ll want to flaunt, and we strongly encourage going for the yellow, blue, or coral colors. The Product(Red) color looks good too, but we’ve seen it many times already, so it doesn’t feel as special. The colors also mask any fingerprints that gather on the glass back.The edges around the phone are aluminum — a step down from the stainless steel in the iPhone XS and XS Max — but the color here is more metallic, providing a nice, complementary two-tone look. The buttons are clicky, as usual.The iPhone XR looks a lot like the iPhone 8 from the back with its single-camera lens, but flip it over and it you get the full iPhone X treatment. There’s a notch, no home button, and an edge-to-edge screen for the most modern iOS experience you can get at this price. The differences between the XS are noticeable here, as the black bezels around the screen are thicker. Still, the bezels aren’t so large that they bulk up the device.We feel like Gollum, admiring the beauty of the one ring. It’s perfection.That’s good, because the XR has a large 6.1-inch LCD screen with 1,792 x 828 resolution. Apple calls it the Liquid Retina Display, and while the screen resolution may sound a little low, it looks sharp at the distance you typically hold your phone. Look closer and pixels will start to be visible. We think Apple could have added at least a 1080p screen here — you’ll hardly find an Android phone in this price range with such a low-resolution screen. Even the $530 OnePlus 6 has 2,280 x 1,080 resolution.That said, it’s difficult to find much else wrong with the display. Black levels aren’t as deep as the OLEDs on the XS and XS Max, but they’re close. The screen is colorful, and it’s plenty bright enough for use outdoors. We think the screen will be good enough for most people, but it’s among the XR’s few shortcomings.The iPhone XR does have the advantage of being the perfect size for people who find the XS too small and the XS Max too big. At 6.1 inches, it sits right in between the flagships (slightly smaller than Samsung’s Galaxy S9 Plus). It’s not as easy to use one handed as the 5.8-inch iPhone XS, but we can still reach most parts of the screen. And it’s not as cumbersome as the 6.5-inch XS Max, which is undoubtedly a two-handed phone.Face ID is the primary way you will unlock the phone, and it works just as fast as on the iPhone XS. At the $750 price range, it’s one of the few facial recognition tools you can use to log into secure apps. There’s not a lot of competition here on the Android side, though that may be starting to change.The stereo speakers on the iPhone XR are loud and sound good, though the audio is not as dynamic or robust as the sound coming out of the speakers from the Razer Phone 2. You’ll be satisfied listening to them if you’re in a quiet room, but they will struggle outdoors if it’s noisy. There’s no headphone jack, and Apple has also decided not to include the 3.5mm headphone jack adapter in the box anymore. You can opt for the included Lightning EarPods, which don’t sound great, or shell out for wireless earbuds or headphones.The iPhone XR is powered by the same chipset inside its more expensive siblings, the A12 Bionic, though it comes with less RAM (3GB instead of 4GB). We’ve yet to see it run into performance issues. The processor makes iOS 12 fluid to operate, and had no problem swiftly swapping through multiple apps. Games like Alto’s Odyssey and Tekken, as well as ARKit 2.0 games like AR Robot, run flawlessly.In Geekbench 4, the iPhone XR rightly scores just under the iPhone XS and XS Max, but it’s faster than any Android smartphone we’ve tested to date. This phone can tackle almost anything you throw at it.This is a phone you’ll want to flaunt.We’ve taken a close look at iOS 12, but the iPhone XR is the first time Apple is bringing several new features that debuted on the iPhone X to a lower price point. For example, you can create Animojis or Memojis in iMessage thanks to the TrueDepth camera. There’s no home button, so you will need to get used to the gesture navigation system, which is among the best available on a phone.The XR does not feature 3D Touch, but Apple has replicated this with a feature it calls Haptic Touch. 3D Touch on the iPhone XS allows you to utilize the pressure-sensitive display to press and hold down on certain parts of the user interface to reveal more actions. For example, pressing and holding down on an email notification would pull up the ability to mark it “Done.” Haptic Touch is more limited. It only works in select areas, such as the Control Center — when you want to expand a tile — or on the lockscreen if you want to quickly toggle the flashlight on or off. How much you’ll miss 3D Touch depends entirely on how much you use it, and we suspect most people don’t use it frequently.Check out our iOS 12 guide to read up on all the new features introduced in the latest version.The iPhone XR has the same main camera on the back of the iPhone XS — a 12-megapixel lens with a f/1.8 aperture and optical image stabilization. It can shoot 4K 60 frames-per-second video, can record stereo sound, packs Smart HDR, and for the first time you can use Portrait Mode without the need for the secondary lens.We’ve tested the improvements of the iPhone XS main camera over the iPhone X, and while they’re not radical, groundbreaking changes, Smart HDR does give the new camera the edge. That feature helps with high-contrast scenarios, minimizing blown out lights or skies and brightening up the foreground to make it visible. It works as advertised on the iPhone XR, producing excellent photos in extreme lighting conditions, though it doesn’t quite match the quality of HDR+ on the Google Pixel 3.Like the more expensive iPhones or flagship Android devices, the camera app has nearly zero shutter lag. That helps capture detailed, well-exposed photographs that retain strong color. It holds its own in low-light scenarios too, though you need to make sure you stay still to prevent a blurry photo.We do miss the telephoto lens included on the iPhone XS and XS Max. The 2x optical zoom lets you take shots that won’t look as good digitally zooming in on the iPhone XR. Going back to a single-lens camera forces us to change the way we take some photos, physically moving closer to the subject instead of standing at a distance. The lack of the secondary lens also affects Portrait Mode, which lets you take photos of a subject with a blurred effect behind them, mimicking a DSLR. We’re quite happy Portrait Mode is available on the XR, as it’s the first time Apple has included it on a single-lens camera phone. Portrait Lighting is also available, but there are only three choices as opposed to the five on the XS — Natural, Studio, and Contour.The iPhone XR doesn’t zoom in to take Portrait Mode photos like the XS, giving you more room to work with. It’s not as accurate as the XS and XS Max, but we’ve been impressed so far. In low light, its photos weren’t as grainy as the iPhone XS.However, Portrait Mode only works on people, and that’s disappointing. On the iPhone XS, Portrait Mode can work on food, people, objects, pets, and almost anything. The XR camera, however, uses this mode partly with the help of artificial intelligence and neural nets. It’s trained on identifying a face, and that’s why it’s capable of outlining people so accurately. When you try to take a portrait photo of a dog or an object, the camera will say, “No person detected,” and it won’t even try. Google’s Pixel 3 smartphone has a single-lens camera and does a darn good job of using Portrait Mode on a variety of subjects. We’re hoping Apple can expand Portrait Mode on the XR to be a bit more versatile over time with software.The front-facing camera is the same TrueDepth camera system as the iPhone XS, so you’ll be able to take excellent Portrait Mode selfies here. It even worked with our dog. This 7-megapixel camera snaps great shots in standard mode, as well.While the iPhone XR’s camera isn’t as versatile as the iPhone XS or XS Max, it’s still top-notch, and the photographs it captures are excellent.The iPhone XR’s battery won’t give you anxiety. It’s a 2,942mAh unit, and we frequently ended a work day with around 50 or 45 percent remaining by 6:45 p.m. That’s taking it off the charger around 7 a.m., and using the phone for browsing the web, taking pictures, streaming music, and playing games. On lighter days of use, we hit 35 percent by 9:42 p.m. This phone will easily get you through a full day, and it may be able to stick around for a few hours the following day if you forget to charge it.The iPhone XR’s battery life won’t give you anxiety.This day-long battery life is on par with other phones on the market like the Galaxy S9 Plus, and it even beats out the iPhone XS Max and iPhone XS. It easily lasts longer than Google’s Pixel 3 and 3 XL, which struggle to endure a day of moderate to heavy use.It supports fast-charging, but the appropriate cable isn’t included, sadly. You can also wirelessly charge this iPhone, just like you can with the XS series and last year’s iPhone devices.The iPhone XR starts at $750, and it’s available now. You can check out our buying guide for the best deals and prices.Apple offers a one-year limited warranty that protects the device from manufacturing defects. You can purchase AppleCare for additional protection.If you still want something that’s easier on your wallet, there are also some discounted options to choose from in our best iPhone deals and smartphone deals lists.Unquestionable superb value — that’s the iPhone XR. It may be missing a few features, but this is the iPhone that will make others yellow, blue, or coral with envy. The colors are stunning, battery life is great, Face ID is still industry-leading technology, iOS gestures are intuitive, the camera is superb, and performance is fantastic. This is the iPhone to buy.Editor’s note: Apple has released the iPhone 12, which is now available for purchase. The iPhone 12 is successor to the iPhone 11, which is itself the successor to the iPhone XR. It improves camera quality and performance, but comes at a slightly higher $799 MSRP. We don’t recommend buying the iPhone XR anymore. Instead, if you want to save money, consider buying an iPhone 11, or the $400 iPhone SE. Here’s our list of the best iPhones you can buy. Yes. If you want all the bells and whistles, buy the iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max. When you compare them, the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are more expensive, but you gain better build quality, a nicer and sharper screen, as well as a more versatile camera. If $750 is too high, Apple is still selling the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 at discounted prices, and they’re excellent phones, though not as futuristic. You can read up on our comparison of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 to know more.Over on the Android side, you’re spoiled for choice. Our pick, however, is the Google Pixel 3. It’s $50 more, but you gain a slightly better camera, excellent software with fast updates, and a high-resolution screen.Apple’s iPhones usually last four to five years, if not more. The iPhone XR is IP67 rated, instead of IP68. That means you can take it underwater up to 1 meter for 30 minutes, and no more. While Apple says it’s the most durable glass on the back and front, it’s wise to buy a case to protect the phone. Apple is selling a clear case for the iPhone XR, in case you don’t want to hide the gorgeous, colored body.Expect to get software updates for the next four to five years. The iPhone 5S, which released in 2013, is the oldest iPhone capable of running iOS 12, so you’re getting a good deal of longevity out of your device.Absolutely. Buy it in yellow. You won’t be disappointed."
88,IPhone XS,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-review/,"Is the iPhone XS the most boring iPhone of 2018? Or 2019? It’s clearly overshadowed by the massive, 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max, and the fresh design of the more affordable iPhone XR. But so what? In many ways, the iPhone XS is our favorite. This smartphone a perfectly sized screen that’s usable with one hand, on top of meaningful performance and camera upgrades … all of which makes it the best iPhone yet.The iPhone XS is almost indistinguishable from an iPhone X. We say nearly, because there are a few tells. If it’s in gold, then it’s the iPhone XS. The new color adds an elegant shine to the edges of the phone, though the rear looks paler — almost pinkish. The back can also slightly change color in different lighting, which is a nice touch.At the very bottom, you’ll notice Apple has cut the number of holes on the left edge of the phone from six to three. Why? There’s now an antenna band on the bottom taking that space, which is a part of the new 4×4 MIMO (multiple in multiple out) framework to allow faster and stronger internet connectivity. In our own unscientific speed test through the SpeedSmart app (on AT&T’s network), our iPhone X hit download speeds of around 64Mbps, and upload speeds of 14Mbps. In comparison, our iPhone XS managed a 74Mbps download speed, and 17Mbps upload. LTE connectivity is definitely faster, but it was tough to notice an immediate improvement day to day.Over on the back, the dual-camera module is a hair taller on the iPhone XS. We mention these two minor changes mostly because you may not be able to use old iPhone X cases on the XS. We’ve tested a handful, and while some fit without a problem, others didn’t. Thankfully, there are plenty of iPhone XS cases available at a range of prices, and we’ve rounded out our favorites in a handy guide.Everything else is more or less the same — that is, if you’re coming from an iPhone X. The glass is purportedly more durable than ever, but it’s still a fingerprint magnet if you choose to forgo a case. The stainless steel frame feels nice to the touch, and it’s also stronger than the aluminum used on devices like the iPhone XR or iPhone 8 Plus.It’s elegantly minimal, made with high-quality materials that scream exquisite, and fits perfectly in our palm.But for many people, the iPhone XS will be their first foray into using an iPhone without a home button, which means there will be a period of adjustment to get used to the gesture navigation system. It shouldn’t take too long, because we think it’s a much more intuitive way of interacting with iOS; it’s far better than the new gesture controls introduced in Google’s Android 9 Pie.It may also take some time getting used to Face ID, which lets you unlock the phone just by glancing at the screen. Apple said Face ID is far more secure than its old Touch ID system, and that’s all made possible due to the TrueDepth camera and sensors in the notch at the top of the screen. With the iPhone XS, Face ID is slightly faster, and it’s ever-so-slightly noticeable through direct comparisons with the iPhone X. Face ID is leaps and bounds better than when it was first introduced last year, and we’ve fewer issues unlocking the phone in the dark. We’re genuinely starting to enjoy using it more than fingerprint sensors on other phones, and now with iOS 12 you can set up someone else’s face as an alternate ID as well.The iPhone XS is our favorite-sized iPhone. It’s elegantly minimal, made with high-quality materials that scream exquisite, and fits perfectly in our palm. But if it’s too small for you, check out our iPhone XS Max review for our thoughts on one of the biggest iPhones to date. And of course, read our iPhone XR review to tide you over until it goes on sale in October.The 5.8-inch screen on the front is the same size as the iPhone X, but unlike last year, the iPhone XS is the smallest in the current crop of 2018 iPhones. The iPhone XR has a 6.1-inch screen, and the iPhone XS Max has a 6.5-inch screen. That being said, the body of the iPhone XS is only slightly bigger than the iPhone 8, iPhone 7 or iPhone 6, all of which had 4.7-inch screens. You’re getting a much bigger screen, for a marginally larger body. We think it’s the perfect size: big enough to make watching movies and videos feel immersive, but not so big that it’s difficult to use one handed (unlike the XS Max).The OLED screen is absolutely gorgeous. It’s plenty colorful, without looking oversaturated, and the OLED really helps make blacks look so deep that it’s hard to see the notch at the top if you use a dark wallpaper. The screen has 2,436 x 1,125 screen resolution (458 pixels per inch), and it’s sharp. Movies and shows like Ready Player One and Iron Fist look incredibly crisp, detailed, and colorful, especially thanks to support for Dolby Vision and HDR10. It all sounds better too, as Apple improved the speakers for wider stereo sound, though they’re not that loud when used outdoors in busy environments. This is really enough screen for most people, but if you frequently binge watch shows on your phone, you may want the extra screen real estate the iPhone XS Max offers.We never had a problem viewing the screen at any angle on the XS, and the screen also managed to get bright enough to see outdoors (though we did have to crank the brightness to the max). Apple’s True Tone technology makes a welcome return — it matches the tone of the screen to the ambient lighting in your surrounding — which makes the screen pleasant to look at in all kinds of environments.The iPhone XS is powered by Apple’s A12 Bionic processor, which is Apple’s first mobile processor built using a 7 nanometer process. It houses 6.9 billion transistors, and Apple said it can deliver stronger performance, while still being more efficient than last year’s A11 Bionic. There’s a Neural Engine inside again for machine learning tasks, but Apple said it now has six more cores (for a total of eight) that allow it to process 5 trillion operations per second. Those are mind-boggling numbers, but at the end of the day all you need to know is that this is the most powerful smartphone in the world right now.This is the most powerful smartphone in the world right now.Whether it’s an augmented reality (AR) game like AR Robot, a graphically-intensive game like Asphalt 9: Legends, or simply swapping between multiple apps as you juggle different tasks, you won’t have issues running almost any app or service on the iPhone XS.Here are a few benchmark results:These numbers are the highest we’ve seen to date from any smartphone, with the closest coming from Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 with its 273,992 AnTuTu score. Benchmarks aren’t the best measure of real-world performance, but these numbers give you a strong idea of the power inside Apple’s new iPhones.Paired with this buttery smooth performance is the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system — iOS 12. We’ve covered all the new features in the update, but our favorites include the new grouped notifications system, which makes them far easier to manage; Memojis, which let you create Animojis based on your own avatar; and Siri Suggestions, which genuinely offers up helpful suggestions. You can read our full impressions in our iOS 12 review.While on a surface level it may seem as though Apple hasn’t changed the camera from the iPhone X, there are some significant under-the-hood improvements in the iPhone XS. You get the same dual-camera system: A 12-megapixel standard lens with a f/1.8 aperture, paired with a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with a f/2.4 aperture. Both have optical image stabilization, and you can capture 4K video up to 60 frames per second. The image sensor is now larger, however, which helps with better low-light photos.As usual, there’s almost zero lag when trying to snap a photo. The camera app is quick to launch, easy to operate, and it snaps photos fast. Images are often well detailed with good color, but there are two areas where dramatic improvements are visible. The first is low light — take a look at the picture below. The colors on the iPhone XS photo are far more natural and appealing, there’s less grain than the iPhone X photo, and bright lights don’t look overexposed on the XS photo.That last bit — where lights on the XS photo don’t look overexposed — is due to a new feature called Smart HDR. Essentially, the camera snaps more photos than ever before when you tap on the shutter button. That includes taking photos at three different exposures, and then combining them all to create the best photo that doesn’t blow out bright lights, or underexpose dark areas. It’s great for high-contrast scenarios, and one of the best examples showing off the difference can be seen with the photo below.There are a few spots in the iPhone X photo that are too blown out, such as the subject’s forehead and the background. Smart HDR on the iPhone XS is capable of capturing more photos at different exposures to avoid that problem, allowing for a much more natural-looking photo that’s just as detailed, with strong color accuracy. It’s an excellent addition, and it easily improves the quality of photos coming out of the iPhone XS dramatically.Apple also said it improved Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting with the new iPhone XS, but the improvements we’ve found stem from the new Smart HDR feature, and the larger sensor which adds less grain in low light. Apple still has some of the best color accuracy here, but we think the Google Pixel 2 still crushes the competition in general with Portrait Mode photos. While we don’t see this as much with the rear camera on the iPhone XS, there are still issues with Portrait Mode accurately identifying the edges of a subject, especially with hair, for Portrait Mode selfies.Alongside the improved Portrait Mode is a new feature called Depth Control. It lets you change the intensity of the blur on any Portrait Mode photo taken on an iPhone XS or XS Max. You can add a stronger blur, or remove it completely. It’s a neat feature that lets you customize exactly how you want your photos to look before sharing them.Apple said it also improved the dynamic range for videos captured on the iPhone XS, as well as low light performance (up to 4K 30 FPS), and the results are indeed excellent. The stabilization continues to be strong, but it’s the colors that impress, as it looks incredibly natural and true to life. There’s also stereo recording available, which is a nice addition.All told, the iPhone XS has an excellent camera with genuinely noticeable improvements over last year’s iPhone X. Does it take the crown as the best camera phone available on the market? We’ll be doing more extensive testing with a range of phones to find out.The iPhone XS will offer up about a full day of battery life, and not much more with the 2,658mAh battery inside. After a day of heavy testing, including music streaming, watching videos, taking lots of photos, and running benchmarking apps, we totaled nearly six hours of screen on time (the amount of time the screen has been on), which is great. That meant the iPhone XS started at 100 percent at 7:30 a.m. and hit 24 percent by 5:30 p.m., so we toggled on low power mode, and it hit 20 percent by 6 p.m.While that’s with heavy usage, on average you can expect to end a work day (around 6 p.m.) with 35 percent remaining or more if you haven’t used your phone too much. We don’t think this battery will take you to a second day of usage (except for very light usage scenarios), which is disappointing.The iPhone XS does support faster wireless charging due to a tighter coil design, and we’ve certainly seen it charge up a little faster on a pad than the iPhone X, but we wish Apple included a fast-charging cable in the box. You need to buy the USB-C to Lighting cable separately for $19, and a 30W charger for $49. That’s an extra $68 in accessories, while almost every Android manufacturer gives you both in the box. Perhaps even more unforgiveable, you’ll need to spend $9 just to use standard headphones with the XS, because Apple has omitted the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter this year. This is an outstanding phone, but Apple’s greedy nickel-and-dime cash grabs are getting out of control.The iPhone XS starts at $999 for the 64GB model, and goes all the way up to $1,349 for the 512GB storage option. It’s available today from a variety of retailers, carriers, as well as the Apple Store. For discounted offers, check out our compilation of the best iPhone deals or the best smartphone deals if you want more options outside Apple.Apple offers a standard one-year warranty that covers manufacturer defects.The iPhone XS is a modest upgrade over the iPhone X, but it’s still the perfectly-sized iPhone that delivers stellar performance, and an excellent camera.Yes, the iPhone XS Max. But that’s only if you want the 6.5-inch screen, which may prove too cumbersome for some. The cheaper alternative is the iPhone XR. It has the same A12 Bionic processor, a single-lens camera, Smart HDR, Portrait Mode, as well as Depth Control — all at a cheaper $750 price tag.If you don’t mind swapping to Android, we recommend waiting to see what’s in store next month as there are several handsets gearing up to launch such as the LG V40, the Google Pixel 3, the Sony Xperia XZ3, the OnePlus 6T, and more.The iPhone XS is wrapped in glass, and no matter how durable Apple says it is, it’s still prone to shattering when dropped. We recommend buying a case to protect your pricy investment. The phone is IP68 water resistant, which is an improvement, and it means it can stay submerged up to 2 meters for 30 minutes. Apple delivers software updates to its smartphones for several years, so it’s safe to say this phone will last you four to five years, maybe more, but you may need to replace the battery at some point when it starts to degrade.Yes. If you want the best phone from Apple that you can use with one hand, get the iPhone XS. If you’re wary on the $999 price tag, then we recommend getting the iPhone XR."
89,IPhone XS Max,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/apple-iphone-xs-max-review/,"One criticism we often used to hear about the iPhone X is that its 5.8-inch screen simply wasn’t big enough. In 2017, big-screen lovers had to opt for the less fully-featured iPhone 8 Plus to get the most real estate. Not anymore: Smartphone shoppers in 2018 and 2019 have the option of the Apple iPhone XS Max, which offers the biggest screen available in an iPhone to date, along with many top-shelf features such as Face ID. It’s the perfect option for people who want to upgrade from older Plus models.For the first time in a while, you no longer have to choose between features when looking at the iPhone XS and XS Max. In the past, opting for the smaller iPhone over the Plus model meant sacrificing some features such as the dual camera. With the iPhone XS and XS Max, that’s no longer the case. Both phones have the same features, except they differ in battery and screen size. As such, you’d hardly find any differences design-wise over last year’s iPhone X.The front carries the now-iconic edge-to-edge design with a notch for the TrueDepth camera at the top. It’s what’s used for Face ID, which lets you unlock the phone just by glancing at it. It’s slightly faster than before, but the difference in speed is negligible. It’s still the most secure facial recognition system on a smartphone, and we’re starting to enjoy using it more than a traditional fingerprint sensor.Our review unit is the new gold color option, which looks elegant ((there’s also a Space Gray option as well as Silver — carried over from the iPhone X). The edges are shiny and vibrant like a gold bar, but the back is surprisingly pinkish. The back of the phone is as minimal as ever, and the gold does tend to change tones in different lighting.Eagle-eyed observers will notice one design change: At the very bottom, Apple has reduced the number of holes on the left edge of the phone from seven to four. That’s because there’s now an antenna band taking up space — it’s a part of the new 4×4 MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) framework to allow faster and stronger internet connectivity. In our own unscientific speed test through the SpeedSmart app (on AT&T’s network), our iPhone X hit download speeds of around 64Mbps, and upload speeds of 14Mbps. In comparison, the iPhone XS Max managed a 82Mbps download speed, and 15Mbps upload. LTE connectivity is definitely faster, but it is difficult to notice an immediate improvement day-to-day.The iPhone XS Max’s expansive screen also makes it the most difficult iPhone to use.Everything else is more or less the same — that is, if you’re coming from an iPhone X. The glass is more durable than ever, but it’s still a fingerprint magnet if you choose to forgo a case. The stainless steel frame is nice to the touch, and it’s also stronger than the aluminum used on devices like the iPhone XR or iPhone 8 Plus.But for many people, the iPhone XS Max may be their first foray into using an iPhone without a home button, which means there will be a period of adjustment to get used to the gesture navigation system. It shouldn’t take too long because we think it’s a much more intuitive way of interacting with iOS; it’s far better than the new gesture controls introduced in Google’s Android 9 Pie.That being said, the iPhone XS Max’s expansive screen also makes it the most difficult iPhone to use. The body may be roughly the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus, but since the screen is much taller, it can be quite difficult to reach the very top with one hand, when you want to pull down the Control Center or Notification Center menus, or hit the back button in some apps. You can always use the Reachability feature to bring the top of the screen down to the middle, but it’s just something you won’t have to deal with on the 5.8-inch iPhone XS.There’s a special feeling you get when the iPhone XS Max sits in your palm and you stare at its massive, 6.5-inch screen.At the same time, there’s a special feeling you get when the iPhone XS Max sits in your palm and you stare at its massive, 6.5-inch screen. Everything just feels so super-sized that it’s hard not to enjoy the extra screen real estate. It’s absolutely perfect for watching movies or shows, especially since the phone supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 (both also available in the iPhone X, but Apple says there is better dynamic range in the newer display). We watched a few episodes from the second season of Iron Fist on Netflix (it’s in HDR), and it was easy to see more details in dark scenes without any trouble, and scenes from the film Bright looked rich in color. Even better is the improved speakers that deliver wider stereo sound. They get plenty loud indoors, allowing you to feel truly immersed in what you’re watching, but they can quickly become tough to hear when watching something outdoors in noisy environments without earphones.It helps that it’s an OLED screen, as there are inky black levels, and the screen is positively sharp at its 2,688 x 1,242 resolution (458 pixels per inch). It’s a screen you won’t want to stop staring at, and we didn’t have any trouble glancing at it outdoors in direct sunlight (though we did need to max the brightness). True Tone technology is back, and we’re glad as it adjusts the screen’s tone to the ambient lighting in your surrounding, making the screen more pleasant to look at.We do like the larger screen, but don’t expect to see more content over the smaller iPhone XS. When compared side to side, most apps hardly showed any more information on the bigger screen, but content generally just looked bigger. Choosing the Max over the regular XS is a purely subjective decision, and we encourage you go to the nearest carrier or Apple Store to handle one yourself, to see if it’s too big or just right.As a note, Apple no longer includes a Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack dongle in the box, so you’ll need to spend extra money to get one at the Apple Store. It’s a little ridiculous since a lot of people still have headphones or earbuds that use the jack, and considering what you’re paying for the XS Max, it’s the least Apple could do.The iPhone XS Max is powered by Apple’s A12 Bionic processor, which is Apple’s first mobile processor built using a 7-nanometer process. It houses 6.9 billion transistors, and Apple said it can deliver stronger performance, while still being more efficient than last year’s A11 Bionic. There’s a Neural Engine inside for machine learning tasks, but Apple says it now has six more cores (for a total of eight) than in the iPhone X, allowing it to process 5 trillion operations per second. Those numbers are difficult to fathom, but essentially all you need to know is that this is the most powerful smartphone in the world right now.This is the most powerful smartphone in the world right now.We played an augmented reality (AR) game called AR Robot, as well as graphically intensive games like Asphalt 9: Legends and Alto’s Odyssey and didn’t run into a single hiccup. Even juggling multiple apps trying to get work done, like signing documents, responding to messages, and creating calendar events didn’t give us any problems. You won’t have issues with performance.Here are a few benchmark results:These numbers are some of the highest we’ve seen to date from any smartphone (the iPhone XS scored slightly higher on AnTuTu), with the closest coming from Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 with its 273,992 AnTuTu score. Benchmarks aren’t the best measure of real-world performance, but these numbers give you a strong idea of the power inside Apple’s new iPhones.Paired with this buttery smooth performance is the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system — iOS 12. We’ve covered all the new features in the update, but our favorites include the new grouped notifications system, which makes them far easier to manage; Memojis, which let you create Animojis based on your own avatar; and Siri Suggestions, which genuinely offers up helpful suggestions. You can read our full impressions in our iOS 12 review.Based on specs, it may seem as though Apple hasn’t changed the camera from the iPhone X, but there are some significant under-the-hood improvements in the iPhone XS Max. It’s the same dual-camera system as before: A 12-megapixel standard lens with a f/1.8 aperture, paired with a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with a f/2.4 aperture. Both have optical image stabilization, and you can capture 4K video up to 60 frames per second. The image sensor is now larger, however, which helps with better low-light photos.As usual, there’s almost zero lag when trying to snap a photo. The camera app is quick to launch, easy to operate, and it snaps photos fast. Images are often well-detailed with good color — even in low light — but there is one area where dramatic improvements are visible, and it’s all thanks to Smart HDR. Essentially, the camera snaps more photos than ever before when you tap on the shutter button. That includes taking photos at three different exposures, and then combining them all to create the best photo that doesn’t blow out bright lights, or underexpose dark areas. It’s great for high-contrast scenarios, and one of the best examples showing off the difference can be seen with the photos below.In each of these photos, you can see how the iPhone X tried and failed to handle bright areas. In the photo with the trees (which were much darker than the white, overcast sky), it tried to lighten up the foreground, and the result is an overexposed photo with poor white balance. The iPhone XS Max, on the other hand, ably handled this situation. In the photo with the dog, you can see the sky in the far left corner is completely white in the iPhone X photo, whereas Smart HDR on the iPhone XS Max helped bring out the actual gray sky. And in the photo of the ramen restaurant, the iPhone X blows up the lights, but it’s not the case on the XS Max’s photo. Smart HDR is excellent, and it dramatically improves the quality of photos coming out of the iPhone XS Max.			Apple also said it improved Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting with the new iPhone XS models, but the improvements we’ve found stem from the new Smart HDR feature, as well as the larger sensor, which reduces grain in low light, and larger individual pixels. Among smartphone makers, Apple still has some of the best color accuracy and the nicest looking bokeh — Smart HDR really does wonders — but we think the Google Pixel 2 still does a far better job of accurately blurring out the right places around a subject.While we don’t see this as much with the rear camera on the iPhone XS Max, there are still issues with Portrait Mode accurately identifying the edges of a subject, especially with hair, for Portrait Mode selfies.Alongside the improved Portrait Mode is a new feature called Depth Control. It lets you change the intensity of the blur on any Portrait Mode photo taken on an iPhone XS or XS Max. You can add a stronger blur, or remove it completely.

Does it take the crown as the best camera phone available on the market? We’ll be doing more extensive testing with a range of phones to find out.The iPhone XS Max has the biggest battery out of all the 2018 iPhones, with a capacity of 3,174mAh. In our testing, it went from 100 percent at 8 a.m. to 20 percent by 9 p.m. with medium usage, including music streaming, some picture taking, and a ton of social media and web browsing. We’ll be continuing to use the Max for more time to see if how long it can last with higher usage.Wireless charging support is available, but the Max will charge slightly faster than the iPhone X or iPhone 8 models, thanks to a tighter coil design. The speed difference is noticeable, but you’re still looking at up to two hours or more to try to get from 20 to 100 percent (depending on the charger). Fast wired charging is supported, but it’s disappointing that you need to buy the cable separately instead of it being included in the box.The iPhone XS Max starts at $1,099 for the base 64GB model, but there’s a 256GB storage option available for $1,249, or a massive 512GB storage option for $1,449. It’s available today from the Apple Store, as well as a variety of retailers and carriers. Check out our buying guide to find the best deals.Apple offers a standard one-year limited warranty that covers manufacturer defects.The iPhone XS Max is likely not for everyone, but you’ll find it hard to stop gazing into its beautiful, 6.5-inch screen. Itc costs an enormous amount of money, and we think the iPhone XR sounds like much better value for what you get.Yes, if you want a smaller iPhone, go for the iPhone XS. It’s a 5.8-inch screen and has a smaller battery, but it will still get you through the day, and has all the same features as the XS Max. If price is a concern, we recommend getting the iPhone XR, which costs $750 but shares a variety of features such as the same primary camera (single lens only), Smart HDR, Portrait Mode, the A12 Bionic processor, and more.If you’re okay with swapping to Android, the Galaxy Note 9 is another big screen phone that’s a great alternative. It’s one of the most powerful Android phones on the market with a 6.4-inch screen, and it has a built-in stylus that can act as a remote control to take photos or trigger other actions. Alternatively, we recommend waiting until the end of October as a number of phones are being released, such as the Google Pixel 3, the LG V40, the OnePlus 6T, and more.The iPhone XS Max is a glass sandwich that’s difficult to hold in one hand — it will try to wrangle its way out of your hands and onto the ground, which is why we recommend buying a case. It is IP68 water resistance, which is better than last year’s IP67 rating. That means the phone should be able to survive staying submerged up to 6.6 feet (2 meters) for 30 minutes.We expect this device to last you more than four to five years, especially since Apple does a great job of supporting older hardware, but you may need to replace the battery at some point if it starts to degrade.Yes. If you want the best from Apple and the biggest screen available, go for the iPhone XS Max.Check out our iPhone XS review for our impressions on the smaller iPhone, and read our iPhone XR review if you don’t want to spend too much on an iPhone."
90,LG G7 ThinQ,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-lg-phones/,"LG has developed a solid reputation for developing some very interesting and attractive Android smartphones, even if it isn’t one of the big boys in the space right now. Whether you’re looking for novel dual-screen devices or dependable all-rounders, LG almost certainly has you covered, and its phones are generally priced more competitively than much of the competition. That said, if you’re new to the LG stable, you may not be sure which is the best model for you, not least when LG’s phones sport confusingly similar names (LG V60 ThinQ versus G8X ThinQ, anyone?).Luckily, this guide offers a rundown of the best LG phones available to buy right now. It features the best LG smartphone overall, and it also covers the best LG phones for particular needs and tastes. This should help you get past all of those confusing code names.Why you should buy this: It’s a beautifully-designed smartphone with a sharp screen, strong battery life, 5G support, and military-standard durability.Who it’s for: Anybody looking for the latest and best LG flagship smartphone and who prizes beautiful looks and long-lasting batteries.Why we picked the LG Velvet: First things first: The LG Velvet looks absolutely stunning, even when compared to beauties from other leading manufacturers like Samsung. It comes in either Aurora Green or Illusion Sunset (a bit like Samsung’s variably bluish Aura Glow color), both of which look exceedingly sleek and alluring. On the front, it boasts an edge-to-edge display with a tidy punch-hole selfie camera at the top, while the rear benefits from a striking teardrop array for its triple-lens camera. It’s also invitingly thin, and its curved edges make the 7.9mm profile seem even thinner in your hands.Its display is also very nice, featuring a big 6.8-inch P-OLED screen with a resolution of 2460 x 1080 pixels. It’s not quite as sharp as the screen you can find in other leading flagships, but it does the job nicely, with its larger dimensions feeling satisfyingly impressive.Its two other big draws are its 4,300mAh battery and durability. The battery will see you into a second day under most usage regimes, while its IP68 and MIL-STD 810G ratings suggest that it can withstand a fair amount of punishment. There’s also the option to buy a separate dual-screen case, so you can operate two touchscreens at once (great for multitasking).In other departments, the LG Velvet is more or less average at best. Its camera takes great ultrawide shots, although the quality of its main lens is occasionally inconsistent, either over- or under-sharpening shots and requiring post-photo editing. Similarly, it uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, which will handle most everyday tasks pretty well but won’t offer the same high-level performance as other flagships.These qualifications aside, the LG Velvet is a very good Android smartphone overall. It’s almost certainly the best smartphone LG has produced to date, and hopefully, it’s something LG can build on in the future.Read more in our full LG Velvet reviewTo put it as reductively as possible, the LG V60 ThinQ is basically a version of the LG Velvet that doesn’t look quite as good, but that still offers pretty much the same performance and the same features. It supports 5G, has a very beefy Snapdragon 865 chip and a highly-enduring 5,000mAh battery, and you can use it with a dual-screen case (purchased separately). It’s almost a great phone, save for an inconsistent camera that struggles in low light and some software niggles (such as bloatware and intrusive reminders). Still, if you can find it for less than the LG Velvet, it may be preferable to the newer model.Read more in our full LG V60 ThinQ reviewWhy you should buy this: You get another great all-round LG smartphone, but with a dual-screen case bundled in for good measureWho it’s for: Anybody who wants to multitask on a high-powered and reliable flagship smartphone.Why we picked the LG G8X ThinQ: While a number of recent LG flagships are compatible with dual-screen cases, only the G8X ThinQ comes with such a case as standard. This makes it the LG of choice for anyone who likes to multitask on their phone or who uses their device for work. The case slots easily onto the phone using a USB Type-C connection, providing a second 6.4-inch OLED display with 2340 x 1080 pixels, just like the G8X ThinQ’s main screen. You can use both screens separately to look at two different apps at the same time, or you can use them in combination as a kind of super-screen. They’re particularly useful for gamers, and the LG Gamepad feature lets you use a virtual video game controller on the bottom screen.Besides the usefulness of the extra screen, the G8X ThinQ flaunts a number of other desirable features. It runs on a Snapdragon 855 chip and uses 6GB of RAM, making it fairly agile as a computing device, although its own software can be a touch sluggish at times. Its 4,000mAh battery is also generous enough when it comes to keeping you going until the next day, although if you use the dual-screen case regularly, you’ll most likely find that you need to charge before bedtime.Also, as with other recent LG phones, the audio experience offered by the LG G8X ThinQ is surprisingly excellent, surpassing even that offered by iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices. Support for hi-res files and Hi-Fi Quad DAC (which processes the audio signal four times in parallel) means noise is kept to a minimum, so you can simply enjoy your favorite music or the soundtrack of whatever movie you’re watching.The G8X ThinQ was released in late 2019 for only $700, so you’ll almost certainly find it online for noticeably less at the moment. Its lack of a face unlock feature — and its occasionally unresponsive fingerprint sensor — is a minor negative, but it doesn’t take away from what is a well-priced and feature-rich Android.Read more in our full LG G8X ThinQ reviewWhy you should buy this: It’s a fantastic midrange phone with a captivating display, versatile camera, and solid battery life.Who it’s for: Anybody who wants high power at a discount, particularly if they’re prepared to shop around for the best price.Why we picked the LG G7 ThinQ: When it was launched in 2018, the LG G7 ThinQ certainly wasn’t pitched as a “budget” smartphone. However, now that it’s over two years old, you can find it for very affordable prices online, and it’s still more than worth a look.It houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and comes with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, meaning that it can still outperform certain Android phones released today. The phone also features a 6.1-inch IPS LCD screen with a 3120 x 1440 pixel resolution, making for an impressively sharp 564 pixels per inch. It supports HDR10, so together with the high resolution, the screen displays pleasingly rich colors and contrasts. All in all, it certainly won’t look out of place if you take it to a party with your Apple- and Samsung-owning friends.With a second, ultrawide lens, the G7’s camera is highly versatile. You can take 107-degree panorama shots with this lens, while the standard 16-megapixel lens captures pictures with a satisfying level of detail while also providing a useful portrait mode. It may not be as high-powered as recent flagships, but compared to other LG devices, it’s one of the best camera phones of the bunch.The battery is also dependable — even though it advertises only a 3,000mAh capacity, it will comfortably last a full day of heavy use. Combined with the excellent audio quality we also find on other recent LGs, this makes the G7 ThinQ a great budget Android if you can find it at a discounted price. It may not include 5G support, but with 5G still being somewhat underused, you probably won’t notice.Read more in our full LG G7 ThinQ reviewWhy you should buy this: If you want to impress your friends with your taste in innovative and unusual smartphones, then the LG Wing is the rotating dual-screen smartphone for you.Who it’s for: Buyers who think single-screen smartphones are just a little too passé.Why we picked the LG Wing:In a world where we’ve now seen foldable phones and dual-screen cases, the LG Wing is still capable of turning more than a few heads. It’s also capable of turning itself, with its main 6.8-inch P-OLED screen able to swivel to a horizontal position to reveal a second, 3.9-inch screen underneath. Once in this position, the smartphone assumes a T-shaped outline where you can watch a video or take landscape pictures.To be brutally honest, the LG Wing’s software doesn’t let you do much else beyond this, but it’s an interesting idea nonetheless, and the phone really does look great. More importantly, the idea has been well-executed, with the swivel screen having been tested to 200,000 rotations, meaning it should outlast the length of time you’re likely to use it. It also feels satisfying and effortless to turn and turn back.Basically, you can use the swivel feature to use various controls on the smaller screen while watching videos in landscape, while a number of video games have been adapted for the Wing (such as Asphalt 9 Legends). That said, other app integrations leave much to be desired, with Twitter (for example) not displaying anything on the lower screen while watching embedded videos in landscape.These quibbles aside, the LG Wing is a solid phone in its own right. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 765G, which means it supports 5G. It also carries 8GB of RAM, so it’s more than capable of coping with most of the latest games and apps. Its camera is also pretty good, with a dual-lens setup in normal mode and a third lens that opens up when you swivel the main screen. The camera also incorporates a very effective gimbal system, which digitally stabilizes shots when you have the phone swiveled open.Finally, the phone houses a 4,000mAh battery, which generally ends a single day with nearly a third of its juice left. Combined with a crisp display that boasts a resolution of 2460 x 1080 pixels, it’s a good phone overall, even if its headline feature ends up being underused.Read more in our full LG Wing reviewWhy should you pay attention to our recommendations? We have reviewed pretty much every major Android smartphone since they first appeared on the scene to rival the iPhone. This includes every major LG smartphone, stretching at least as far back as the LG G2.Because we’ve been following LG devices since the start, we know how new models stack up against predecessors and similar devices from other manufacturers. We thoroughly test each phone we cover before writing about it, living with it every day as our main smartphone. This way, we get a strong handle on its strengths and weaknesses and how it performs under various everyday conditions.Once we’ve done this, we then report back to you with our findings. We know that most people don’t buy a new phone lightly, so we pay attention to what most people are looking for when on the hunt for a new device. We focus on the important aspects of each phone while trying to make each of our articles as accessible and fun to read as possible."
91,LG V40 ThinQ,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/lg-v40-thinq-review/,"The V40 ThinQ is LG’s fourth flagship smartphone of the year, and LG has clearly refined on its predecessors to make it the best of the lot. Why? It shares a lot of similarities with the V30S ThinQ, the V35 ThinQ, and the LG G7 ThinQ, but it’s the camera on the V40 that sets it apart. There are two extra lenses, bringing the entire system to a total of five cameras for a kind of versatility you don’t often see on a smartphone. The drawbacks? The V40 costs $900, and at that price you should expect the level of polish you get from an iPhone XS.The V40 ThinQ is an amalgamation of last year’s LG V30 and the LG G7. From the back, it almost looks exactly like the V30 but with the addition of a third camera on the horizontal module. The indented fingerprint sensor below is fast to react, and it’s in an optimal position, but it no longer doubles as a power button which LG first changed in the G7. The back is clean and simple, though the glass easily picks up fingerprint smudges, and we do think LG could have played around more with color, as the New Aurora Black option is a little dull (Moroccan Blue is available in other regions).The glass curves into the edges, making the V40 supremely comfortable to hold — you never feel anything rough. LG also prides itself on its ability to make the V40 incredibly light at just 5.96 ounces. As a reference, the smaller iPhone XS weighs 6.24 ounces. To us, that just makes the V40 feel slightly cheap. It’s so light to the point that we’re concerned about the phone’s ability to withstand a single drop. Still, we do like how narrow the phone feels thanks to its 19.5:9 aspect ratio.The phones power button is now on the right side, with a volume rocker on the left and the A.I. Key from the G7 makes a return below. The A.I. Key lets you call upon Google Assistant, and it works incredibly well. We have accidentally pressed it, but we’ve actually enjoyed using to the point that we’ll stop short of calling it a problem (unlike the Bixby Key). If you don’t want to use Google Assistant, there’s a way to turn it off, but sadly that means it will remain a useless key on your phone as you can’t remap it. The headphone jack is at the bottom, next to a USB Type-C charging port and bottom-firing speaker.The V40 feels good in hand and minimizes looks — it doesn’t try to make a statement with a flashy design or eye-catching colors.The V40’s OLED screen is bigger than ever before at 6.4 inches, with a 3,120 x 1,440 resolution (536.92 pixels per inch). The larger size isn’t too unwieldy, though it can be tough to reach the top of the phone without shuffling it down in your hand. To increase the screen to body ratio, the V40 has a notch, which is sure to split opinion. We’d have liked for the contents in the notch to look a bit more symmetrical (the speaker is off to the right and the two front cameras to the left), but this is a minor qualm.Having used phones with notches for a better part of the year, we’re not bothered by its presence here, but there’s also a tool in the settings that lets you mask it through software if you can’t stand it. There’s a small bezel on the bottom, also known as a chin, but it’s not too noticeable.The screen supports HDR10, and it looks sharp and colorful. It’s not quite on the level of the screens from the iPhone XS or the Galaxy Note 9 — it doesn’t get as bright, which means you really need to crank the brightness to the max to see anything in direct sunlight, and LG also doesn’t let videos cut past the notch, so it doesn’t feel as expansive or immersive when watching a movie (you might like this if you hate the notch). What we love is the OLED’s inky blacks. Throw a dark wallpaper on and it’s tough to tell where the bezel ends and the screen starts. It looks great.The V40 feels good in the hand and it looks minimal. It doesn’t try to make a statement with a flashy design or eye-catching colors. It’s perhaps a little too subtle — we haven’t found ourselves yearning for it.LG has added one of the G7’s signature features into the V40: The Boombox speaker. This is no small feat, because it requires completely changing the way the phone’s internals are organized. It’s only a single, bottom-firing speaker, but the whole phone acts as a resonance chamber, which helps push out incredibly loud audio with decent bass that also sounds good.That means you can feel the phone’s vibrations when you play music or watch a video, but it’s not too distracting. The audio quality is still impressive. We played music outdoors at the park, and we were just able to make it out in the midst of all the various noises. It’s a decent alternative to carrying a Bluetooth speaker, though you will likely still want one if you want to make sure you can hear the V40 in loud environments like parties. If you often play music through your phone’s speakers, you’ll love the Boombox on the V40 — just make sure it’s placed on a flat wooden or metal surface for optimal sound.Like most Android flagship smartphones this year, the V40 ThinQ is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor with 6GB of RAM. There’s 64GB of internal storage, and a MicroSD card slot lets you add more if you need it.We have yet to run into any performance issues: Apps open quickly, moving throughout the Android operating system feels fluid, multi-tasking posed no problems, and games like Alto’s Odyssey ran without a hitch.Here are a few benchmark results:These scores are in line with several other smartphones with the same processor, though the V40 does seem to score on the lower end. The Galaxy Note 9’s AnTuTu score of 273,992 trounces the V40, and so does the cheaper OnePlus 6, which scored 269,191. Benchmark results aren’t a good measure of real-world performance, and you’ll be able to throw most tasks at the V40 without running into problems.One of our biggest disappointments is how the V40 ThinQ runs Android 8.1 Oreo instead of Android 9 Pie, which Google released early August. LG once was the first manufacturer to launch a phone with a new version of Android before anyone else (the V20), so it’s sad to see its flagship phone launching without the latest version of Android. LG hasn’t provided any details as to when you can expect it either.Otherwise, the software experience on the V40 is decent. It’s not our favorite Android skin layered over, but there are a good deal of customization options to tweak the interface to your liking. Don’t like LG’s Smart Bulletin to the left of the home screen? We haven’t found it to offer any meaningful information, and thankfully you’re able to turn it off.Our V40 is a Verizon model and it included a ton of bloatware, most of which are un-installable, except for carrier apps and a few others.LG’s new five-camera system on the V40 makes it the most versatile camera LG has ever produced. The main three cameras are on the back: A standard 12-megapixel lens with f/1.5 aperture and optical image stabilization; a wide-angle 16-megapixel lens with f/1.9 aperture; and a telephoto 12-megapixel offering 2x optical zoom with f/2.4 aperture. The ability to go for a closer shot, swap to a wider one, or stick with the standard lens immediately makes this camera fun to play around with creatively.Photos are well-detailed, colorful, and often have excellent white balance. We have noticed that photos can sometimes look too processed, with a lot of sharpening or simply oversaturation. The skies in some of these photos look unnaturally blue, for example. Also, only the standard lens’s pixel size is 40 percent larger over the V30 (with a 15 percent larger image sensor) — that means the standard lens delivers the best image quality and low-light photographs. We wish LG had enhanced the other two cameras as well so that photos could look more consistent.For example: In low light, the standard lens is quite capable, delivering photos that can match up against the iPhone XS or even the Galaxy Note 9. Swap to the telephoto or wide-angle lens, however, and the image quality declines. Photos are grainier, white balance is a mess, and it simply makes us not want to use those two cameras in these lighting conditions.We’ve also noticed the telephoto lens isn’t really utilized in low light, as the aperture in the image file suggests it’s the standard lens doing the work zooming in digitally. Regardless, we’re glad to see there are substantial improvements to low-light performance here as it was one of our primary complaints with the LG G7.What’s neat is if you press and hold on one of the three buttons to swap between the lenses, you can get a preview of what your photo will look like from all three cameras in real time. There’s also a new feature called Triple Shot. It takes three consecutive photos with all three lenses — that’s actually handy, because you can easily get three different perspectives at the push of a single button. This doesn’t happen immediately, though; it takes about three seconds for Triple Shot to complete.The video effect the V40 uses to stitch together all three photos is a little gimmicky. It’s a strange effect, and nothing we ever would want to share.A.I. Cam is back again, and we still think it’s still something you won’t really need to use mostly because you need to turn it on to use it. It recognizes scenes and adjusts the photos to what it thinks is best, which generally just means it cranks up the saturation, but it can tweak exposure as well. It works in some scenarios, like food photography and some of the other examples below, but more often than not it can make photos look unnatural. You’re better off ignoring it.The V in V40 stands for video, and while there’s no noticeable improvements to video capture, LG’s latest added feature is called Cine Shot, which lets you take cinemagraphs. Cinemagraphs are a hybrid between photos and videos — a part of the photo is still, but there’s some motion thrown in. It’s a feature we’ve seen before on phones — most recently the Moto Z3. You need to frame your photo really well to get something worth sharing (and stay incredibly still when capturing). Then you’ll need to mark the area of the video you want to keep in motion. You can pinch and zoom to be precise. It’s a neat feature that’s fun to use, but the image quality sometimes suffers (the resolution is 1,920 x 1,080).We’d have like to see bigger improvements to video capture here, such as a super slow-motion option like on the Galaxy S9 Plus, or the ability to capture 4K HDR content like the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium.While the camera system is impressive on the whole, we do have few qualms to share. It can be quite buggy and sometimes slow. When we wanted to quickly snap a picture in the moment, the app just showed a black screen and wouldn’t launch the camera. We had to force close the app and relaunch the camera, but we had missed the photo opportunity — this happened on at least two occasions. There’s also occasionally a little shutter lag, which doesn’t necessarily produce blurry photos, but there’s a noticeable delay from when the photo has been captured. Our device is a pre-production unit, so these bugs may be worked out for the final version.Portrait Mode is also extremely frustrating. It takes ages to register a face, and if it does, it loses it instantly. It’s a test of patience not just for you, but the subject as well who has to stay still as you move the camera around their face trying to get the feature to work. When it does work, the results look good. The camera does a solid job of accurately identifying the areas it needs to blur out, and the bokeh effect is strong. We just wish it worked reliably.LG’s cameras still aren’t up to par with the competition in terms of dealing with high-contrast scenarios. There’s an HDR option, but it’s not nearly as good as what you’ll find on last year’s Google Pixel 2, the iPhone XS, or the Note 9. This applies even in Portrait Mode, as you can see how blown out the sky looks in some of the photos above.There are also two more cameras on the front of the phone — an 8-megapixel standard lens with f/1.9 aperture; and a 5-megapixel wide angle lens with f/2.2 aperture. The latter lens is better used for group shots, or when you just want more background in your selfie, however it’s only a 10-degree difference which is a little disappointing.We’d have liked to see a wider second camera. The photos from these cameras are decent. They look grainy with fuzzy details in anything other than good lighting. We do like the selfie portrait mode, though.Overall, the V40 ThinQ has a versatile camera system that takes good photos in a variety of lighting conditions, but it’s not as polished as we’d like. Photos can look inconsistent between all three cameras on the back, and results in general can look a bit too processed. We love the ability to swap from the telephoto to the wide angle, and in that way, it certainly is a camera that makes us want to be creative with the photos we take.The V40 ThinQ has a 3,300mAh battery inside, and we’ve found it to last just about a full day of use and no more. On a light to medium day of usage, including using social media, snapping photos, playing games, and watching videos, we took the phone off the charger at 7:30 a.m. and ended with 22 percent by 8 p.m. On a heavier day of usage including running benchmark apps, we ended the day with 15 percent by 8:30 p.m. We averaged about four hours of screen-on time.It’s satisfactory battery life, but we’d really like to see LG push the envelope here and try adding a bigger battery so we can take the phone into a second day without worrying about having to charge it.Wireless charging is available, and so is support for Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging technology. We plugged in our device at 1:32 a.m. with 22 percent remaining, and it hit 100 percent by 3 a.m.The LG V40 ThinQ is currently available for sale, and it’ll set you back $900. It’s available through various carriers including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular (pricing varies). We go into detail on all your options in our LG V40 ThinQ buying guide.LG offers a standard 1-year warranty for its mobile devices that covers manufacturing defects from the date of purchase.The LG V40 ThinQ isn’t inspiring, but it has a creatively fun camera, and it nails many of the fundamentals that make it a good phone. Considering we’ve seen three other flagship phones from LG this year, we’d have liked to see more improvements happening at a faster pace, such as a larger image sensor for the wide-angle camera for better low light photos, a bigger battery, a wider front-facing camera, and more.Yes, but before recommending anything, we’re going to say you should wait if you’re unsure about the V40. There will be a plethora of devices being unveiled this month, from the Google Pixel 3 to the Razer Phone 2. You’ll be spoiled for choice, and we think it’s worth waiting to see what other manufacturers have in store before shelling out $900 for LG.If you can’t wait, take a look at the Galaxy S9. It costs less, has a strong camera that’s on par with LG’s V40, excellent performance, slightly better software, and it’s cheaper. The Google Pixel 2 or 2 XL will also likely become a lot cheaper within the next two weeks after the Pixel 3 is unveiled, and it’s an excellent phone with a camera that outmatches the V40. If you don’t mind iOS, go for the iPhone XS. It has stellar performance, a great camera, and fluid software.The LG V40 ThinQ will likely last you around three years, maybe more if you take care of it. You should nab a case to protect the Gorilla Glass 5 body, but the phone is IP68 water resistant, so it should be able to survive underwater up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. LG is trying to improve its track record with delivering software updates in a timely fashion, but the fact that the V40 launches without Android Pie isn’t promising. Expect to get updates for two years, and no more.Yes. It’s a little pricey, but you’re getting an overall good phone. Keep in mind, LG typically slashes the prices of its phones a few months after launch date. If you can wait, it’s likely you’ll find the V40 for a few hundred dollars off within four to five months."
92,Moto G6,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/moto-g6-review/,"Motorola is back. Really back, because its new generation of Moto G budget phones have the full Motorola brand name stamped on the front. None of that Moto only nonsense. It’s celebrating the 45th anniversary of being the creator of the phone used to make the first mobile call, and what better way than to launch three new desirable “G” phones (two in the U.S.). Meet the Motorola Moto G6, which we’ve been using for some time to find out if it’s our new best budget phone.Forget metal. Glass is the premium material you want your phone made out of in 2018, at least, that’s what Motorola tells us, and it’s why the Moto G6 is made of the lovely, shiny, reflective, and breakable material. It’s Gorilla Glass 3, which should be slightly more durable, but a case may still be in order. The G6 body is warmer to the touch than you’d expect, but not as slippery as you may fear. It does attract dust and fingerprints, though.Get it in the right light, and you’ll notice a neatly engineered “S” shape reflection in the rear panel, and we love the sunray-effect on the circular camera lens bump, making it resemble the face of a watch. However, the two camera lenses and flash unit inside also look like a little face, which is hard to un-see. It’s also a sizable camera bump, where the edges feel sharp. Weirdly, there’s a pronounced lip along the top and bottom of the rear panel, where the body and glass meet. We don’t think it’s poorly built, or an error in manufacturing, but it does feel out of place on such a well-engineered little phone.The G6 body is warmer to the touch than you’d expect, but not as slippery as you may fear.The curve of the body is reminiscent of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S7, and therefore the Honor 9, all of which is a good thing as it’s supremely comfortable to hold. While glass is a premium material, and the phone is attractive, the G6 surprisingly doesn’t feel high-end. This is primarily due to its light weight, and the unusual texture means the glass doesn’t really feel like glass.Is it going to smash into tiny pieces at the merest hint of a fall? Maybe, but Motorola does include a transparent silicone case, which was already fitted to our review phone in the box. It’ll protect the finish, and evens out the rear panel by blending into the camera bump. It’s a thoughtful inclusion, and will save you a few bucks, too.Turn the phone over to see a slightly taller phone, with an 18:9 aspect ratio screen. The phone still has bezels, edges of the phone on the top and bottom of the screen, but they’re not as chunky as before. It’s not as bezel-less as the Galaxy S9, or Huawei P20. It’s more along the lines of the OnePlus 5T or the Honor View 10. A thin fingerprint sensor is fitted in the G6’s chin. It’s fast, but not lightning fast, especially when the screen is off. It’s easy to locate with your finger, which is key.We’ve nitpicked on the design here. Why? The Moto G6 costs $250, but the phone feels like it should cost more than that, giving us higher expectations. You won’t nit-pick, and will instead marvel at how you paid so little for a phone this well designed. Sadly, it’s not very exciting to look at, a theme which continues elsewhere.The Moto G6 has a 5.7-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio LCD screen, with a 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It’s a beauty, with vivid colors and a pleasant tone. Photos taken with the camera look realistic and attractive when viewed on the screen, while games like Happy Hop burst out with vibrancy. We’d expect to see a display this good on a phone costing a lot more. It doesn’t get too bright though, and we often cranked the brightness to the max. This lower than expected brightness didn’t affect outdoor viewing greatly, and we didn’t have issues using Google Maps in the car, but the battery won’t be thanking you.The software is welcome on the one hand, and frustrating on the other. Motorola continues to do the right thing by presenting Android 8.0 Oreo in its standard form, with only a few software modifications. The March 2018 security update is currently installed on our review phone. Motorola told us that it’s dedicated to supporting the G6 with future software updates, and it’s not certain it will deliver Android 8.1, the phone will receive an update to Android P in the future. Good news.One app installed by Motorola is the Moto app, which includes several customizations unique to the G6 range. We like Moto Actions, a variety of gesture controls that do speed up commonly-used features. Turn the phone over to mute a call, swipe to shrink the screen down for easy one-hand use, and a double “chop” to turn the flashlight on or off.We love the sunray-effect on the circular camera lens bump.One Button navigation turns the fingerprint sensor into a multi-function alternative to the Android Back, Menu, and Home buttons. This makes the most of the long 18:9 screen, and some may find it faster to use than the buttons. It’s not enabled by default, which is also good, and doesn’t force anyone to learn something new unless they want to. We tried it for a while, but eventually returned to the regular Android buttons. They aren’t broken, so they don’t need fixing.We do have some issues with the software. An annoyance is the seemingly forced use of Outlook for email during setup. Despite trying not to use the pre-installed app, it was impossible to complete the setup process without it. Additionally, we didn’t like Moto Key, an alternative to Google’s Autofill password system, which doesn’t offer any major benefit on mobile over Google’s system, and requires a Lenovo ID and sharing of login and passwords. It does integrate with Windows PCs, which may benefit some people, but that also needs an additional piece of software installed. A lot of bother for not a lot of point.Then there’s Moto Voice, a voice assistant that’s in beta and disabled by default. It operates in a very similar way to Google Assistant, which is also available, and can perform actions including composing messages, turning on or off Bluetooth, and returning web search results. It does have a voice unlock feature. Say, “Hello Moto,” and from a black screen your phone springs into life; but it’s difficult to say when we’d actually use this.This is a mid-range phone, so don’t expect it to challenge the best flagship phones. Inside is a Snapdragon 450 processor with 3GB of RAM.We ran some benchmarks to find out where it stands:This puts the G6 beyond the outgoing Moto G5S, and just ahead of the Honor 7X; but slightly behind the HTC U11 Life. Remember, benchmarks are fine for comparison’s sake, but aren’t representative of a device’s overall ability.In the real world, the Moto G6 has acceptable performance. This is not a multitasking powerhouse though, and we did experience some frustration when leaping from app to app, particularly data-heavy Google Maps to Google Photos, for example, which is slow to start up. Google Photos is the G6’s default gallery app, and it can get very slow. Due to its reliance on data, it became unresponsive when signal was low, and it was impossible to view the camera’s photo album.We wanted more battery performance out of the Moto G6.Playing simple games didn’t present a problem. Playing more complex, higher-performance titles like Reckless Racing 3 was fine on the default setting; increase the frame rate up and you’ll run into problems. Mid-range phones have improved dramatically recently, especially with Honor releasing some very good and very cheap devices. Putting the $200 Honor 7X alongside the Moto G6 does make the latter feel a little sluggish, in a way that standard Android really shouldn’t.We’ll put this down to software optimization, due to the benchmark results being superior to the Honor 7X. We know it’s not a $900 phone, but the slightly sluggish performance didn’t inspire us to use the phone for tasks that required speed. If you’re a power user, this isn’t the phone for you.There are two camera lenses on the back of the G6 — a 12-megapixel lens with an f/1.8 aperture, and a 5-megapixel secondary lens. Motorola has added various features in an effort to make using the two lenses more fun. The first is Spot Colour, where all other colors except the one selected turns to black and white. It’s moderately effective, but requires the right scene to really pop. The problem is if the scene is too busy with colors, is plagued by reflection, or in very bright sunlight, it gets confused and doesn’t separate them effectively.There’s a Portrait mode too, which is considerably better than the one we tried on the Moto X4, which suffered terribly with slow speed. This is version two of the software introduced on the X4, and it’s much faster. Shutter lag is greatly reduced, but it is still there if you’re too fast into the camera app from startup. There is some slowdown when swapping between modes as well. The camera app itself is decent, with a single swipe bringing in the menus, so it’s easy to use.Take photos everyday with the Moto G6, and it’ll perform well.Take photos everyday with the Moto G6, and it’ll perform well. It captured blue skies attractively, and colors are vibrant and accurate. The extra modes are fun, but we probably wouldn’t end up using them on a regular basis, mainly due to the advertised function not being quite as good as the hype. A good example of this would be Face Filters, which adds Snapchat-style looks to your selfies. They’re effective enough, but quite often they don’t look very good. If that’s your experience on the first try, you may not return.The front-facing selfie camera is acceptable, but we had trouble getting the automatic beauty mode to work, as it often refused to recognize a face for more than a second. It can also be used manually, which also didn’t seem to make much of a difference.It feels as though Motorola should take a step back with adding all these gimmicky features, and should prioritize software optimization and speed first.It’s a 3,000mAh battery inside the Moto G6, which Motorola said will last a day. This estimation is accurate, provided your definition of a day is about 12 hours. For us, the Moto G6 lasted from early in the morning until after the work day ended. On a day using GPS and taking photos, the battery did deplete quickly; and only just lasted until we were home.The TurboPower fast-charging system with the USB Type-C port is very welcome, especially at this price, and gives six hours use from 15 minutes of charging. We wanted more out of the battery on the Moto G6, which is often a major consideration at this price.NFC is onboard for Google Pay, giving it a point over the Honor 7X, plus there’s Dolby Audio enhancements for music playback, but there’s only so much a single speaker can do.In the U.S. the 3GB RAM and 32GB storage version of the Moto G6 costs $250, and in the U.K. it’s 220 British pounds. In the U.K., through an offer with Amazon, you can buy a 4GB RAM and 64GB storage version of the Moto G6 for 240 British pounds, which is good value considering the amount of extra storage. The Moto G6 does have space for a MicroSD card in its hybrid SIM tray.The phone is available now and sold online and through carriers in the U.S. and in the U.K. In the U.S., Verizon is offering the phone online and in stores for $10 a month, paid over two years. The warranty period in the U.S. is 12 months, but 24 months in the U.K., but it doesn’t cover normal wear-and-tear, including the battery. Motorola will either repair, replace, or refund you in the event of a claim, depending on the situation.There are three Motorola Moto G6 phones. The G6 we reviewed here is the middle of the three, and it’ll be joined in the U.S. by the cheaper, $200 Moto G6 Play. It has a lower specifications, and doesn’t have Gorilla Glass. In the U.K. and other parts of the world, Motorola will also sell the Moto G6 Plus, which is a step above the Moto G6 with a slightly larger screen and a faster Snapdragon 630 processor.The Moto G6 defines what a good value smartphone should be like by including all the features and design flourishes you want, without an off-putting price tag. Software isn’t its strong point, and the battery isn’t large enough; but it’s great for casual and first-time smartphone owners.What are the alternatives?When the original Moto G was released, it faced almost no meaningful competition. The Moto G6 doesn’t enjoy such uniqueness, and if you’ve got less than $300 to spend on a phone, there are multiple choices.Honor presents a stiff challenge with the Honor 7X and the Honor 9 Lite; both are excellent phones with strong features–and a very low price. The Honor 7X is $200, and the Honor 9 Lite $250.The new Nokia 6.1 is a $270 phone with Android One, recently launched in the U.S., and is joined by the Nokia 6 internationally. We recently reviewed it and found it to be the best phone under $300. Sony’s Xperia XA2 is $350, but has a better camera on the back, and you’ll also pay around that much for the HTC U11 Life and an iPhone SE. If you’re willing to wait a little longer and save up a little more money, we recommend taking a look at the Honor View 10 and the upcoming OnePlus 6.How long will it last?The Moto G6 isn’t any more durable than other glass-bodied phones, so make sure you use a case if you’re prone to dropping phones. It doesn’t have an IP-rating for water resistance — although Motorola says it has a water resistant coating — so if it takes a bath, it’ll probably break. Motorola has promised to supply software updates, and our model runs Android 8.0 Oreo with the March 2018 security patch.It’s a mid-range phone, and we’d expect that in a year or two’s time, you may want to upgrade to something faster. It won’t stop working, of course, and provided you have realistic expectations of its ability, will serve you for much longer if you’re not interested in joining the continuous smartphone upgrade cycle.Should you buy one?Yes. It’s very difficult to hold the Moto G6’s downsides against it. The software could do with some improvement; but it’s perfectly usable provided you don’t expect too much, and the camera is still good, even if the special features aren’t quite as much fun as Motorola makes them out to be. The battery doesn’t last long enough, but with fast charge this isn’t quite a concern. Ultimately, the Moto G6 costs $250, and for that it’s excellent value."
93,Moto Z3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/moto-z3-review/,"At a time when smartphone prices are through the roof, Motorola is charging a little under $500 for its 2018 flagship phone. Why? The new Moto Z3 is the first smartphone that’s “upgradeable to 5G” via a 5G Moto Mod, which magnetically snaps onto the back of the phone, allowing for much faster data speeds. By keeping the phone’s price low, the cost of the 5G mod won’t feel as exorbitant, and it also allows people to buy more Moto Mods to suit their lifestyle.There are a few caveats. The Moto Z3 does not have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 or 855 processor like the competition, it’s not water resistant (nor does it have Motorola’s signature Shattershield display), and most importantly, it’s only available through Verizon. You won’t be able to buy it from other carriers, or unlocked. The 5G Moto Mod, which we’ll discuss below, is also locked to Verizon’s network.But if you’re a Verizon subscriber looking for a phone in this price range, the Moto Z3 is a solid choice.The Moto Z3 is almost an exact replica of the mid-range Moto Z3 Play, with the differences being a lower-performing processor and a slightly lesser camera in the Z3 Play. Since both share the same design and display, we strongly recommend checking out our Moto Z3 Play review, where we discuss this in greater detail.But to summarize: The phone is exceptionally thin, so it doesn’t feel too thick when you attach Moto Mods. These mods range from a battery and speaker to a projector and 360-degree camera — they snap magnetically to the back of the phone, and data is transferred through Pogo pins at the bottom. We’ve found a few of them to be useful and fun, but most are expensive, and it’s also cumbersome to carry these mods around unless you always have a backpack or purse nearby.When Motorola announced the Moto Mod program and the first Moto Z in 2016, the company said it would commit to the same modular dimensions for Moto Z devices up to three years. This is the third-generation Moto Z phone, so we asked Motorola’s president, Sergio Buniac, whether the 5G mod will be the last Moto Mod. His answer? “No.” Buniac doesn’t see Motorola dropping support for them soon, so your Moto Mods should still hold a little more value for future Moto Z devices, but no timeline for the Moto Z program was shared.The Moto Z3 is almost an exact replica of the mid-range Moto Z3 Play.Back to the phone. The fingerprint sensor is on the right edge, which is unusual, but we’re pleasantly surprised at how well it works. This is subjective, though, and you may prefer a sensor on the front (like previous Motorola phones) or on the back. There’s no headphone jack, but a 3.5mm to USB Type-C converter is in the box, and the biggest disappointment is the speaker. It’s a single mono earpiece at the top; it doesn’t get loud, and the audio sounds tinny. You’ll definitely want the speaker mod if you want to blast music with this phone.The 6-inch display has skimpy bezels surrounding it, which means this phone won’t feel much bigger than last year’s Moto Z2, which had a 5.5-inch display. It’s a Super AMOLED screen with a 2,160 × 1,080 resolution; it’s sharp and colorful, with incredibly deep blacks. Reading the screen in direct sunlight is manageable, though you will need to crank the brightness to the max.Check out our Moto Z3 Play review for more details on this section.The biggest difference between the Moto Z3 and the Moto Z3 Play is the processor. We were pleasantly surprised with the Snapdragon 636’s performance in the Z3 Play, but the Snapdragon 835 with 4GB RAM kicks things up a notch and delivers even more power. It’s still not as powerful as the 2018 processor of choice — phones like the Samsung Galaxy S9 and LG G7 ThinQ utilize the Snapdragon 845 — but you should be able to run almost anything you throw at the Moto Z3.Here are a few benchmark tests:The Moto Z3 sits near most 2017 flagship smartphones, but it’s in the dust of other 2018 devices. The Galaxy S9 Plus scored an AnTuTu score of 263,591, for example, and the OnePlus 6 trounces it with its 269,191 score. That being said, you likely won’t notice a performance difference. Apps open fast, scrolling in apps like Twitter and Instagram is smooth, and games like Alto’s Odyssey and Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire run without issues. Don’t let this older processor deter you: Performance isn’t a problem here at all.The phone runs Android 8.1 Oreo, and it’s almost stock Android. Motorola hasn’t changed the design of the operating system, but it did add the Moto app. It lets you turn on the Moto Display, which subtly alerts you to notifications as they arrive, and you can also turn on gestures to control the phone. A double-twist of the device will launch the camera, or a chop-chop action will activate the flashlight. These are handy, and quick ways to access these services. Moto Voice also lets you control aspects of the phone with your voice, but we found it easier to use Google Assistant, which is also available.Motorola also has its own gesture-controlled navigation system you can turn on. It’s an elongated bar at the bottom of the screen; swipe it right for Recent apps, swipe it left to go back, press it to go home, and press and hold it to call Google Assistant. It’s easy to use, gives you more screen space, and works well.One thing we don’t like is the amount of bloatware. Presumably because this is a Verizon-locked phone, Motorola has been forced to pre-install quite a number of apps and games. You can thankfully uninstall most of these, but the Verizon apps can’t be removed.The Moto Z3 packs a dual-camera system on the rear, with a 12-megapixel lens with a f/2 aperture, and a 12-megapixel monochrome lens. (The Moto Z3 Play differs here with a 12-megapixel lens paired with a 5-megapixel depth-sensing lens.)The camera app is quick to launch and the shutter button is fast to react. Photos in daylight look good —strong details and good color accuracy — and we’ve been surprised at how well the HDR works on this phone. High-contrast scenes are kept well exposed thanks to Motorola’s post-processing.The Moto Z3’s camera can produce some decent shots in less-than-ideal lighting, but in low light you may as well put the phone away. The camera has trouble autofocusing, details are completely fuzzy, and grain takes over the photo completely.In low light, you may as well put the phone away.The monochrome mode is fun, and the portrait mode does a solid job with identifying edges around a subject to produce a strong blur. It does make a good deal of mistakes, so you’ll need to retake the photo a few times, and it often has problems with hair. It’s also available for the front-facing 8-megapixel lens, but it doesn’t work as well.There are a few other features in the camera app as well, such as Spot Color, which isolates one color of your choice in a photo and turns everything else black and white; Cinemagraphs, where you can isolate movement in a particular part of a GIF for a cool effect; and there’s even the option to jump straight into YouTube Live from the camera.We’re mostly happy with the Moto Z3’s camera, though it certainly needs to improve its low-light camera game if it wants to compete with devices similar to its price range, such as the OnePlus 6.The 3,000mAh battery easily managed to get us through a full day. Starting off the charger at 7:30 a.m., with heavy to medium usage including using social media, watching YouTube videos, streaming music, and playing games, we ended with a little under 40 percent by 7 p.m.With even lighter use — such as over the weekend — it wasn’t uncommon to find more than 60 percent remaining by 8 p.m.If you want even more juice, you can nab a battery Moto Mod and attach it to the phone, which should easily make the Moto Z3 last almost two days. Otherwise, you can rely on the included TurboPower charger to juice the phone back up quickly.Stepping away from the Moto Z3 for a minute, let’s take a look at one of the key selling points of the Moto Z3: It’s the first phone that’s upgradable to 5G. You can read our primer on 5G here, but bottom line, carriers are racing to be the first to deploy 5G networks around the country, which will bring significant speed improvements over 4G LTE, among other benefits. The 5G Moto Mod allows Moto Z3 owners to utilize 5G speeds when they are in select areas, based on Verizon’s coverage map. It launched in pockets of Chicago and Minneapolis so far, with more than 30 cities expected by the end of the year.The 5G Moto Mod is a little thick, and it has a unique shape that makes it something you wouldn’t want to have attached to the back of the phone all the time. Like all Moto Mods, it magnetically attaches to the back of the Moto Z3. Four millimeter-wave antennas implanted in the device ensure you consistently get a 5G signal without interference.There’s a 2,000mAh battery inside the 5G Moto Mod. Unlike other mods where their batteries would deplete first before the phone’s battery kicks in to power them, the 5G Moto Mod’s battery will deplete alongside the phone — you’ll never end up with a dead Moto Mod first.You’re not going to access 5G as soon as you slap the mod on.The 5G Moto Mod also has its own SIM card inside, and two modems: Qualcomm’s X24 and X50. In a 5G-supported area, it can get more than 450Mbps speeds. In 4G LTE areas, the X24 modem should still be able to net higher speeds — a marked improvement of what you would get from the X16 modem built into the phone. We spent a day in Chicago to test these speeds, and you can read our thoughts here.What do these dramatically faster data speeds enable? Well, it will drastically change the way we use our smartphones. Think about this: It currently takes around a minute and 20 seconds to download 90 songs from Spotify on an iPhone X using 4G LTE — that’s with peak download speeds. With the 5G Moto Mod on the Moto Z3, Motorola said you will be able to do the same thing in 10 seconds. Downloading 200 pictures from Google Drive will take 30 seconds; downloading four episode of Game of Thrones will take a minute; downloading one 4K movie from Netflix will take around a minute and a half.5G will affect everything from cars to the Internet of Things, but for our purposes here with the 5G Moto Mod, expect your smartphone experience to dramatically improve. The mod costs $350.The Moto Z3 costs $480 and it’s only available from Verizon. You’ll have to pay $350 for the 5G mod.Motorola offers a standard one-year limited warranty, which covers manufacturer defects.The Moto Z3 brings strong performance, an all-day battery, and an affordable price tag. The potential of 5G aside, it’s the best option for Verizon subscribers looking for a sub-$500 phone.Yes. You shouldn’t overlook the OnePlus 6, which costs $530, has the newer Snapdragon 845 processor, a better design, and stronger cameras. It’s the better phone in every way — but we can’t recommend it here because you won’t be able to use it on Verizon or Sprint.Other strong options include the Asus ZenFone 6 and ZTE Axon 10 Pro. Both of these slightly newer phones have the excellent Snapdragon 855 processor, which certainly outperforms what’s in the Moto Z3. However, you can’t upgrade those phones to 5G support. That’s the trade-off you must make.The Moto Z3 is protected by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and back, which means you’ll still want to throw a case on the phone. There is no water resistance, so you should be careful with this phone around water.It should receive software updates for the next two years, and we expect it to last your around three to four years, if not more, in total.Yes, if you want to upgrade to 5G at a relatively low price. The ability to upgrade to 5G is the Moto Z3’s headline features, and it’s less interesting if you’re not going use it."
94,Moto Z3 Play,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/moto-z3-play-review/,"When Motorola announced pricing for its newest phone, we were perplexed. Why would anyone pay $500 for the Moto Z3 Play when you can spend $30 more and get the OnePlus 6, a phone with superior specifications, and better design? Well, after using the Z3 Play for more than a week, the answer isn’t too simple.First off, the Moto Z3 Play works with every major U.S. carrier including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, whereas only people on GSM networks like T-Mobile and AT&T can use the OnePlus 6. Second, you’re not just getting the Moto Z3 Play when you drop $500 — you’re also getting the Moto Power Pack battery mod. We’ll get to how it works later, but attach it to the Z3 Play and Motorola claims a combined battery life of 40 hours. That’s a lot of juice.It’s unclear if Motorola plans on selling the Moto Z3 Play without the mod bundle, which would ideally place it around the $450 price mark; but for $500, a phone with almost two days of battery life sounds like a good deal. How’s everything else? Let’s just say we’ve been enjoying our time using the Moto Z3 Play.It’s hard to tell the Moto Z3 Play isn’t a flagship phone. The body is sandwiched with glass like most high-end phones (specifically Gorilla Glass 3), and the polished aluminum frame features curved edges, making the phone comfortable to hold in the hand. It’s well built and feels expensive.One of the first things you notice about the Z3 Play’s design may be its thinness, because at just 6.75mm (0.26 inches), it’s thinner than all the latest iPhones. We like how thin it is, especially because it also helps make the phone lightweight at just 156 grams. For comparison, the iPhone X is 7.7mm thin (0.30 inches) and 174 grams.There’s a reason for this level of thinness that we’ll get to soon, but it comes with drawbacks, namely the camera bump. The rear dual-camera system sits in a circular module that is thick, and it sticks out like a sore thumb. It’s ugly, and makes the back of the Z3 Play look unfinished. It irks us everytime we place the phone down on a table as well, because the camera is the first part of the phone that touches down. Thankfully, these problems can be fixed with a Moto Mod style shell.It’s hard to tell the Moto Z3 Play isn’t a flagship phone.Moto Mods are what make the Moto Z series unique. See the 16 golden pins on the bottom rear? That’s where you can attach different mods, like the included Power Pack battery mod, to enhance the phone’s capabilities. Simply place the mod on the back of the Moto Z3 Play, and it stays connected magnetically. We attached a wood Style Shell to the back of the phone for some added protection, and to make the camera bump flush. You can leave the Power Pack mod on permanently, and while it does make the phone thicker, it’s still comfortable to hold. That’s precisely why Motorola made the Z3 Play so thin like its predecessor. Adding mods to the phone creates some bulk, but a thinner phone alleviates that problem.There are 14 mods in total, including a projector a stereo speaker, a Polaroid printer, an Alexa-enabled speaker, a gamepad, and a wireless-charging mod. A few of these are genuinely fun and handy, but some are just too pricey. We’re fans of most of them like the Moto Stereo Speaker, the Power Pack, and the Style Shell with Wireless Charging, but it can be a pain carrying these around because they’re essentially the same shape of the phone (unless you have a backpack or purse with you at all times).The Moto Mods are simple to use and they work well, but not all of them are useful. If a mod or two pique your interest, then there certainly is a reason to choose the Moto Z3 Play over any other phone. You should know that if you choose to swap to another non-Moto Z phone, these mods will ultimately become useless paperweights unless you manage to sell them.The mods have a lot to do with influencing the size and shape of the Z3 Play. Motorola had to make sure old mods still fit the phone, so it had its hands tied with the phone’s design. Still, the company has managed to keep things fresh by slimming down the bezels around the screen on the front of the phone. It makes the Moto Z3 Play look far more contemporary, and downright sleek. By doing this, Motorola was also able to make the screen bigger while still maintaining a similar body size. The Moto Z2 Play has a 5.5-inch screen, and its successor now has a 6.01-inch screen.Subtle Motorola branding sits on the bottom bezel on the front, with a selfie camera up top next to the earpiece, which is the only speaker on the phone. The speaker is disappointingly quiet, and we often had to bring the phone closer to our face to hear audio for videos if we were in any sort of busy environment.The fingerprint sensor — with its unusual placement — is surprisingly great.On the upper right edge is the volume rocker, with an indented fingerprint sensor below, and a textured power button lies on the left edge. There’s no headphone jack, sadly, but a USB Type-C charging port is on the bottom edge. You get a 3.5mm headphone jack to USB-C dongle in the box.The left-side power button may be an issue (or a blessing) for lefties, but we found all the buttons to be easily accessible. The fingerprint sensor — with its unusual placement — is surprisingly great. It reacts quickly, and it manages to identify our thumbprint often without fail.We like the slim design of the Moto Z3 Play, and the slimmer bezels help make it look contemporary. That being said, the design doesn’t make us yearn for it; it doesn’t feel particularly special.The 6.01-inch AMOLED screen didn’t give us many problems at all. It looks colorful, and it’s sharp with a 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution. If the colors are too saturated for you, there are some options you can tweak in the Display settings menu to tone it down. We were satisfied most of the time with the brightness at 50 percent, but we did need to crank it to the max in bright daylight — and even then the screen was a little tough to see.Performance blew us away. Coming to this phone from the Sony Xperia XZ2 — which is incredibly speedy thanks to the Snapdragon 845 processor — we were surprised at how well the Moto Z3 Play performed considering it’s powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 with 4GB of RAM.The Moto Z3 Play’s performance blew us away.Apps open quickly, and moving throughout the operating system is fluid and speedy. Multi-tasking doesn’t slow this phone down, and we only occasionally noticed some stutters playing graphics-intensive games like Shadow Fight 3 — but it really wasn’t common.Here are a few benchmark results:The AnTuTu score is well below flagship phones with the Snapdragon 845 processor like the OnePlus 6, which is understandable, but it’s ahead of many other phones on the market. Benchmarks aren’t a good measure of real-world performance, though, and we think most people will be more than satisfied with the Moto Z3 Play’s power.The phone comes with 32GB of internal storage, but there’s a 64GB option as well. A MicroSD card slot means you can add more storage if you need it.The Moto Z3 Play runs Android 8.1 Oreo, with the May 1 security patch from Google. Motorola doesn’t have a great track record of issuing timely updates to its smartphones, so while we have confirmed this phone will receive Android P and Android Q, don’t expect the updates to arrive instantly after Google releases them. The Lenovo-owned company also tends to push out security updates in batches every few months, rather than a monthly schedule like Google.Thankfully, the software experience itself is largely untouched. It’s mostly stock Android, which is simple to use, uncluttered, and the interface looks good. There’s hardly any bloatware pre-installed.Motorola does have some additions, though, and we’re fans of most of them. The Moto app lets you turn on Moto Actions, so you can make gestures like a chopping motion twice to turn on the flashlight, or twist the phone twice quickly to open the camera. You can also turn on Moto Display, which shows discreet notifications on the lock screen and lets you turn on the blue-light filter at night.Thankfully, the software experience itself is largely untouched. There’s hardly any bloatware pre-installed.Then there’s Moto Voice, which lets you use your voice to control functions on the phone, open apps, search for the weather, and more. It’s really unclear what advantage there is to using Motorola’s system over Google Assistant, which is accessible from the home screen and far more functional.We do like Motorola’s simple new Android navigation system — which is turned off by default. Similar to Android P, it adds a white pill-shaped bar at the bottom. Move it left to go back, tap it to go home, and move it right to see your recent apps. You can press and hold it to access Google Assistant as well. It takes up less room than the traditional Android navigation bar, which means there’s more screen space for other content.The camera is often the weak point of Motorola phones, and that rings true here on the Moto Z3 Play. You can certainly nab some great photos, but the camera app is slow to open and use, and photos taken in poorer lighting tend not to look good.A dual-camera system on the rear carries a 12-megapixel lens with a f/1.7 aperture, and a 5-megapixel depth-sensing lens. In daylight, the camera performs respectably. The Moto Z3 Play does a decent job of not overexposing or underexposing high-contrast scenarios thanks to its high dynamic range function (HDR). There’s good color accuracy, but details can sometimes look a little too oversharpened, and the camera often prefers to slightly overexpose everything a little. Still, we were happy with most of the photos we took in good lighting conditions.There’s a Portrait Mode available, and it attempts to blur the background of a subject to create a nice depth effect. Sadly, it’s not great. It often had trouble identifying the proper edges around a subject, though we did notice it tended to work better on food than people’s faces.When you get into less than ideal lighting situations, the Moto Z3 Play’s image quality takes a hit. Details are fuzzy, there’s a lot of grain, and you need to stay still to avoid a blurry shot. The camera had trouble focusing in low light as well.It’s in lower-light scenarios that you notice the failings of the camera app even more — it takes even longer to open, and the shutter button is slower to react, which means even blurrier photos. Forget ever trying to quickly snap a photo in the moment, because you’ll just end up wanting to delete it.There are a few other camera modes to tinker with, such as Spot Color, which singles out a color in a photo and converts the rest into monochrome. A new mode called Cinemagraphs lets you capture 10 seconds of a video, freeze an area of the video, and keep one area in motion. It’s a neat effect, but the quality of the final result isn’t great. These two feel more gimmicky than camera features we actually want to use daily.The 8-megapixel front-facing camera is standard fare, producing good selfies in good lighting. The screen acts as a flash in dark spaces, so low-light selfies still tend to look good. You can also take Portrait Mode selfies, and we found they looked better than the rear camera portraits.The camera is respectable here. We are happy with many of the photos we’ve captured with the Moto Z3 Play, and we even have managed to take some decent photos in low light, but a lot of them require a few takes, which isn’t ideal. The shutter lag, slow app, and mediocre performance in low light easily makes this the weakest part of this phone.The Moto Z3 Play will mostly get rid of your battery anxiety, thanks to its 3,000mAh battery capacity. Taking it off the charger around 7:30 a.m. and using it heavily throughout the day — which includes playing games, watching videos, taking photos, streaming music, and browsing the web — we ended up with 30 percent remaining by 8 p.m. Another similar day of heavy use had us ending with 35 percent by 6 p.m.This is all with high usage though, and we found ourselves more frequently arriving home with a little under 50 percent remaining around 6 p.m. with medium use. On weekends when we used our phone less, it wasn’t uncommon to see 66 percent remaining by 6 p.m.The good thing? The Moto Z3 Play charges incredibly quickly thanks to the company’s TurboPower technology. We plugged the phone in at 33 percent, and it hit 100 percent within 50 minutes. Even better, all of this battery testing doesn’t include the Power Pack Moto Mod you get with your purchase. We didn’t receive one to test, but with the battery mod on we can easily see this phone lasting you just about two days, no less.There’s no wireless charging support, but there’s a Moto Mod that enables it to work with any Qi wireless charger, which is convenient.The Moto Z3 Play costs $500, and comes with the Power Pack battery Moto Mod. It’s available now from Motorola’s website, and it works on Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint.Motorola offers a standard one-year warranty in the U.S., which covers the phone from manufacturing defects.The Moto Z3 Play delivers good performance, great battery life — especially with the bundled mod — but its camera is the weakest link.Yes, the OnePlus 6. For $30 more, it offers superior performance, a slightly better camera, and it looks much nicer. Battery life won’t match the Moto Z3 Play, but the OnePlus 6 also has one of the speediest fast-charging systems available as well. You’re also likely to get more consistent software support for a longer period of time. For more affordable options, check out our best cheap phones guide.If your budget isn’t limited to $500, there’s always the Google Pixel 2 or the Samsung Galaxy S9 — or an iPhone X if you’re not tied down to Android. You can read more about our favorite picks in our best smartphones guide.The back and front of the Moto Z3 Play may be protected by Gorilla Glass 3, but that’s not going to stop it from shattering after a drop or two. You’ll want to grab a case, or use a Moto Mod to cover up the back of the phone. This phone has no water resistance, but a nano coating does help protect it from splashes of water or spills.Software-wise this phone will get Android P and Android Q, so expect it to last a little more than two years — likely three to four before you start seeing battery issues.Yes. You should buy this phone if you are on Verizon or Sprint — if not, buy the OnePlus 6. If the OnePlus 6’s day-long battery life isn’t enough for you, then you will be plenty satisfied with the Moto Z3 Play and its included battery mod. If you have extra mods from previous Moto Z-series smartphones, it may be worth getting the Z3 Play to continue to make use of them.Updated on July 31: We’ve added a video for the Moto Z3 Play review."
95,Motorola One,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/motorola-one-vision-review/,"At Motorola there was one man with a goal. One may even call it a mission, which he carried out with his heart and soul until he reached a solution. In a flash of light, he made the One Vision. Well, that’s possibly what happened. Or maybe it was just what Queen said.If Motorola’s man-with-a-mission set out to make a dependable, capable smartphone at a price that’s affordable, then it’s definitely mission accomplished. The Motorola One Vision delivers a Pixel 3a-type of experience, for considerably less money, and who isn’t tempted by that? What’s more, it’s great to see Motorola go in a different direction from others with the One Vision, rather than just photocopy the iPhone.Instead of sticking with the same old G-Series design, or making the One Vision another iPhone clone, Motorola has done something different. It has followed Sony’s unique approach of using a 21:9 aspect ratio screen, which makes the phone thinner and taller than others with a similar 6.3-inch screen size. The resolution will make this unusual shape more understandable, as it has 2,520 x 1,080 pixels, while the Pixel 3A XL has a 6.1-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio screen with a more standard 2,160 x 1080 resolution.The lack of an always-on display continues to frustrate me on non-AMOLED phones, but the One Vision’s screen is a bright little thing, and the colors when watching videos like Twice’s Happy Happyreally pop off the screen. But if you’re expecting to enjoy masses of 21:9 content, you’re going to be disappointed. Yes, you can find some 21:9 shows on Netflix and, um, trailers on YouTube, but that’s about it. It’s not a reason to buy the One Vision, but the size of the phone itself is; I love the compact proportions the 21:9 aspect ratio brings. It’s just so manageable, without sacrificing screen size.The screen is wrapped inside a plastic body shell, but you wouldn’t know it if I didn’t say. The rear panel on my review phone is a beautiful blue, with a stylish sheen over the top and laser-like lines running through it which catch the light in a distinctive way. It’s warmer to the touch than glass and more grippy, which is helped by the 8.2mm thickness and chunky sides. It’s 167 grams, so lightweight by modern phone standards.I love the compact proportions the 21:9 aspect ratio brings to the One Vision. It’s just so manageable.Rather than add a notch, Motorola has used a hole-punch to store the selfie camera. It’s in the top-left of the screen, and is far larger than the 4.5mm hole-punch used on the Honor View 20 and Honor 20 Pro. It does stand out more due to its larger size, but you soon forget it’s there. Use the right wallpaper too, and its presence is effectively obscured. The hole-punch slims the bezels down too, but there is still a noticeable bottom bezel, and several millimeters of bezel around the sides. Don’t let this put you off, the One Vision still looks very modern.You get a 3.5mm headphone socket on the top, a reliable and fast fingerprint sensor on the back, a textured power button, and a USB Type-C charging port. There is a single speaker on the bottom of the One Vision, and it’s good, with plenty of volume and a surprisingly amount of power. Music over the headphone jack sounds great too.The Motorola One Vision looks great, feels great, won’t slip out of your hand, and doesn’t look exactly like every other phone either. It’s excellent.Sony’s IMX586 48-megapixel camera sensor is about the most popular sensor we’ve seen, as it is showing up on a massive variety of smartphones this year, and the One Vision is another to add to the list. The f/1.7 aperture sensor with optical image stabilization is joined by a second 5-megapixel, f/2.2 aperture depth sensor on the back of the phone, set in the top left. It uses quad pixel technology to boost low-light performance, and therefore doesn’t have a dedicated 48-megapixel mode, and instead takes 12-megapixel shots using this technology.It’s also packed with features. There’s a new Night Vision mode, which takes multiple shots at different exposures, then with some software trickery creates one noise-free photo. Spot Color retains a single color in a shot and makes the rest black and white, plus there is a portrait mode, and Cinemagraph, which records a few seconds of video for a moving photo.Is the camera any good? Yes, especially for the price. On sunny days, blue skies pop, and on overcast days the sky and clouds have just the right degree of detail. At night, the Night Vision mode takes atmospheric photos and the boasts about reduced noise are accurate, as it smooths night skies and subtly-lit subjects out nicely. However, some may find the results too artificial. The One Vision’s photos have a pleasingly-tuned, natural look to make them more shareable, without over-saturating the end result. But it can struggle in very bright light, when the HDR feature fails to balance effectively. It’s a small negative though, and I have enjoyed taking photos with the One Vision’s camera.The One Vision’s photos have a pleasingly-tuned, natural look to make them more shareable.How about the features? They’re mostly gimmicks, but they can be fun. Spot Color is probably the most interesting, as it drains the photo of color apart from one chosen hue. If you pick the right color, the end result looks great, but it’s not very good at separating similar colors, and it can end up looking a little messy. Sadly, unlike Huawei and Honor’s similar feature, there’s no way to edit out these unwanted colors from the end result.By far the worst thing about the One Vision’s camera is how slow the shutter is, and the app itself, which is not very logical. The features are all indicated by icons, rather than words, and the slide-in menu is jerky and not well laid out. Coming from vastly superior camera apps, like the OnePlus 7 Pro and the iPhone XS, it’s a disappointment.The selfie camera has 25 megapixels, and some really fun features. Portrait and Spot Color work on the front too, and the interface is user-friendly, making selecting varying depth-of-field effects easy. Spot Color works in the same way as the rear camera, and provided you choose wisely, it produces an effective picture.The Beauty Mode can be switched off, and isn’t too aggressive unless turned up to maximum, when it’s capable of smoothing out even the craggiest of faces. The Portrait lighting effects aren’t that impressive, and require exactly the right lighting conditions to look anything other than obviously artificial. However, the selfie camera doesn’t deal with bright conditions very well, and often over exposes the background.This is an Android One phone, which means you get to enjoy an almost Google Pixel-like software experience, and the benefits of regular updates from Google too. The review model came with Android 9.0 Pie installed, and the May security update. It will receive Android Q when the time comes.The software is clean, uncluttered, simple to use, and free from bloat and interruption. It’s impossible to ruin Android One, and with a decent processor behind it, the performance can be reasonable too. Motorola installs its own Moto app, where you can customise some aspects of the phone, such as the how the lock screen works to activating the flashlight with two karate-chop actions. But otherwise, only Google’s apps come pre-installed.It’s not dissimilar visually to Motorola’s own Android experience on the Moto G6 and the Moto G7, but the software is noticeably more stable, and less pushy about Motorola’s own apps. There’s no Moto Voice feature, for example, and it’s not missed. Google Assistant is on call with a long press of the Home button.The 21:9 aspect ratio screen makes a 5×4 icon layout look quite squashed, but all icons are easily accessible with one hand. This and the rear mounted fingerprint sensor makes picking up, unlocking, and using the One Vision very quick and easy, compared to a bigger phone with an in-display fingerprint sensor.The processor is not a Qualcomm Snapdragon, but a Samsung supplied Exynos 9609 — a 2.2GHz octa-core chip that’s probably equivalent to a higher-spec Snapdragon 600 series, for reference. It’s accompanied by 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The One Vision never feels slow, but it never feels very fast either. The good thing is performance is never slow enough to be annoying, but longer-than-they-should-be pauses are common. You get used to it, but move on to a higher performance phone, and you really see the One Vision’s power shortcomings.Compare these benchmark results with its competitors, and the One Vision’s scores consistently puts it above the Nokia 7.1 and slightly behind the Google Pixel 3a. Android One helps iron out the One Vision’s mid-range performance, as it’s mostly a great experience.There’s a hybrid SIM tray inside the phone, ready to take two SIMs or a single SIM and a MicroSD card, which is always a welcome addition. We have had it running in dual-SIM configuration and it has functioned adequately, although I have noticed it has struggled to use data services in low reception areas, more so than other phones. This may be due to the signal indicator not correctly displaying how much signal the phone actually has.One Vision, one day battery life. The 3,500mAh cell never ran out of energy before the end of a day, but it did get close when under strain for more than a few hours, particularly when streaming music or video for extended periods. Moderate users, which is the majority of people who will consider the One Vision, won’t worry too much.If you want to play games, stream media, use the camera, and go on social media a lot in a single day, expect some battery anxiety after the sun goes down. The battery’s shortcomings are highlighted during our YouTube video streaming test, where the One Vision played a 1080p video continuously at full brightness over Wi-Fi for just 7 hours and 2 minutes.Motorola’s 15W TurboCharge is utilized with the One Vision, and it took about 90 minutes to take the battery from flat to full, with 30% coming up in 20 minutes. There’s no wireless charging, but this would be considered a luxury at this price.The Motorola One Vision is available through Motorola’s online store, Amazon, and other partners in the U.K. now for 270 British pounds, or about $342. In Europe it’s yours for 300 euros. Well done, Motorola, that’s some strong value. The One Vision is not expected to go on sale in the U.S., which is a shame as it looks like a much better buy over the Moto Z4.Motorola proves it hasn’t forgotten how to make a great phone for a reasonable price. The Motorola One Vision gives us what we want from a smartphone — good design, a capable camera, usable software, and all-day battery — and then remembers this shouldn’t be exclusive to phones that cost the same as a month’s rent.The Motorola One Vision’s big adversary is the Google Pixel 3a. It’s $400 in the U.S., or 400 British pounds in the U.K. where its value is considerably worse than in the U.S. — but the temptation of the very strong camera and smart software is strong. The One Vision looks better, is cheaper, has a good camera that comes close, and Android One. In the U.K. it definitely is the more sensible buy.It may be getting a little old now, but the Nokia 7.1 is also a solid purchase. It looks good, has Android One as well, and the camera takes decent pictures. If you search, you can find it for a lot less than the original $350/300 pound launch price too.Finally, there are plenty of other Motorola phones around this price, just to confuse you. The $300 Moto G7 is great, but the camera can’t keep up, and then there is the $500 Moto Z4, which shares many of the same technical attributes, but supports Motorola’s Moto Mods accessory system, for which you pay more for the device in the first place (the Moto Z4 is only available in the U.S. and Canada).The One Vision is not water resistant, but the plastic body should prove harder wearing than one made of glass in the event of a fall. A transparent silicone case is included in the box to keep the phone looking its best.Its mid-range specs mean that after two years, it may feel sluggish when attempting to run the latest games, or perform processor-intensive tasks. However, if you’re not going to use the phone heavily, this won’t be much of a concern. Android One guarantees software updates for this period of time too.Yes. There’s nothing here that’s a major drawback. It’s a great price, the design is stylish, the camera takes good photos, the software is excellent, and the battery lasts all day unless you’re really pushing its capabilities. It deserves the same plaudits lavished on the Google Pixel 3a, because don’t forget, it’s less expensive."
96,Nokia 1,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-7-1-review/,"Move over, Motorola. There’s a new budget king in town. HMD Global, the company that licenses and creates Nokia smartphones, has slowly but surely been introducing unlocked smartphones in the U.S., and it’s on a roll. It brought the Nokia 6.1 earlier this year — which we consider to be the best smartphone under $300 — and the latest Nokia 7.1 is easily the best phone you can buy under $400. Motorola’s slew of budget phones have been dethroned.The Nokia 7.1 looks and feels like a flagship smartphone, has a fantastic screen with HDR support, performs well, has Android One with a promise of fast updates, and packs a capable camera for the price tag. You can get a lot for $350 these days, but the Nokia 7.1 should be at the top of your list, because it’s close to the perfect budget phone.The Nokia 7.1 exudes a kind of regality not often found in budget phones. It feels as though it costs much more than it does, and that’s largely thanks to the aluminum unibody that feels firm and brick-like, as though it can withstand numerous drops. The edges around the sides are flat, which helps with grip, and the glass on the back and front makes the phone look and feel like a 2018 flagship.While the “toughened glass” back does a lot to further this phone’s aesthetics, there’s no utility, which means there’s no support for wireless charging and there’s a good chance it will crack after a few drops on a hard surface. We suggest buying a case.We’re partial to the Gloss Steel color, but the Midnight Blue looks just as elegant. The back is simple, with a dual-camera module at the top (that sticks out a little), a sensibly-placed fingerprint sensor that’s quick to react, followed by a Nokia and an Android One logo below.There’s also a Nokia logo on the front of the phone — two is a bit excessive. On the blue model, you’ll find silver trimmings around the edges on the front and back, and around the camera module. It adds a bit of flair to an otherwise plain phone, but the copper accents are better on the Gloss Steel.There’s a headphone jack at the top (hear, hear), and a USB Type-C charging port at the bottom alongside a bottom-firing speaker. The power and volume buttons are on the right edge, and they are satisfyingly clicky.The screen makes no compromises; Colors are punchy, there’s good contrast, and the screen is crisp.Flip the phone around and you’ll be greeted with a notch (the cutout housing the selfie camera) at the top, and a sizable bottom bezel or “chin” with the second Nokia logo. This is one of HMD’s few phones with a notch design, and it looks good. The notch isn’t too big, and becomes less noticeable after you use the phone for some time. The bottom bezel is thicker than we’d like — it’s no Honor 8X – you’ll get used to it, too. Regardless, we’re happy to see the edge-to-edge design make its way to HMD’s budget phones.The screen comes in at 5.84 inches, and we love the size. It’s similar to the iPhone XS, which we lauded for being the perfect size for a smartphone. It’s easy to reach all parts of the screen (your mileage may vary), and the 19:9 aspect ratio means it’s a very narrow phone, making it manageable to hold in one hand.HMD hit the build quality and design of this phone out of the park with the Nokia 7.1. This is an affordable phone in the body of a flagship.The Nokia 7.1 has an LCD screen (protected by Gorilla Glass 3) with a resolution of 2,280 x 1,080, and it’s one of the highlights of the phone. It’s colorful and sharp, though black levels aren’t deep. We haven’t had an issue with the screen’s brightness, as we’ve been able to see it well outdoors. It can also become dim when required, which is perfect for reading in bed at night.HMD has somehow brought a flagship feature down to this $350 phone: Support for HDR10. That means you can enjoy wider color support and stronger contrast when watching HDR-supported content through apps like Netflix and YouTube. The screen also automatically converts any standard definition (SD) content into HDR. It’s not a dramatic difference, but it’s noticeable and it looks better than SD (you can turn this off if you don’t like it).The screen makes no compromises. Colors are punchy, there’s good contrast, and the screen is crisp – This is a great phone for watching videos and movies.The Nokia 7.1 easily performed all the tasks we expect from our flagship phones.What about audio? There’s a single bottom-firing speaker, which is easy to block when holding the phone in landscape mode. Still, we’re impressed by how loud these speakers get, and surprised at the quality. It’s nothing like the stereo sound the Razer Phone 2 pumps out, but it sounds full-bodied and rich, though bass is weak. The headphone jack is always there when you want to plug in.The Nokia 7.1 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 processor, with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and a MicroSD card slot in case you need more space. A 3GB RAM and 32GB storage option is also available — just not in the U.S.We’ve been using this phone for more than two weeks, and it easily performed all the tasks we expect from our flagship phones. It zipped through the Android operating system and ran all our favorite apps. We did notice an occasional hiccup, though, and the phone can slow down a little when you juggle multiple tasks at the same time.Most games run well on this phone, but you may have issues with titles that are graphics-heavy. We played Alto’s Odyssey and Tekken, and while both performed admirably, there were moments when they stuttered a little — especially when notifications came through.The AnTuTu score is well ahead of budget competitors like the Moto G6 Plus (90,483), Moto G6 (70,827), and it even bests the pricier Moto Z3 Play (110,949).We’re happy with the Nokia 7.1’s performance. Its satisfactory day-to-day capabilities make it perfect for the average person.The Nokia 7.1 runs Android One, a version of Android straight from Google without any bloatware. It’s uncluttered, simple to use, and moving throughout the OS is quite speedy. It’s running Android 8.1 Oreo at the moment, but HMD said the phone will receive an update to Android 9 Pie by the end of November.That’s the other benefit of Android One. There’s a promise of fast version updates for two years, and security updates for three years. That helps keep your phone up to date and secure, which is rare for phones in this price range.Budget phones often falter when asked to snap photos. The Nokia 7.1 proves otherwise, and while low-light performance isn’t its strong suite, it’s capable enough. It has two lenses on the back, both with Zeiss optics. The primary is a 12-megapixels lens with a f/1.8 aperture, and it’s paired with a 5-megapixel lens for depth sensing.The camera is quick to launch, though there’s a small delay when snapping pictures. You must be very still to keep a image in focus, otherwise you’ll end up with a blurry shot. Photos in general deliver accurate colors, and daylight shots are surprisingly detailed. There’s good HDR for most situations, though the sky can sometimes look blown out.In low-light environments, details quickly deteriorate, but colors are solid, and photos don’t look too noisy. The camera does have trouble focusing in dark conditions.Now we need to talk about the phone’s biggest weakness. Battery life.Portrait Mode is available on the back camera, as well as the front 8-megapixel selfie camera. Again, you need to stay still to make sure the photo isn’t blurry, but results are solid. The cameras do a great job of identifying the edges of a subject, struggling only slightly with hair.The camera has an easy-to-use Pro mode that lets you adjust settings, and HMD’s “Bothie” mode is available, which lets you snap a photo with the rear and front camera at the same time. It’s a fun feature that lets you stay in the shot while capturing the action.Overall, this is easily among the best cameras you’ll find in a smartphone of this price. Optical image stabilization would improve the experience, but we’re quite satisfied with the photographs the 7.1 produces.So far, so good, but now we must talk about the phone’s biggest weakness. Battery life.The Nokia 7.1 has consistently surprised us.On most days (with medium to light use), we were able to squeeze out a full day of use out of the 3,060mAh battery, with around 30 percent remaining by 6 p.m. That’s an average of 3.5 hours of screen-on time.But on more demanding days, with gaming, photos, music and video streaming, and a lot of instant messaging, the phone came close to dying around by 4 or 5 p.m. — if we wanted to stay out late, we had to plug it into an external battery pack to make sure it lasted the night. That happened on two occasions.Luckily, the phone charges quickly. HMD says it can hit 50 percent with just 30 minutes of charging, and that’s the speed we saw in tests. We plugged in the phone at 18 percent, and it hit 60 percent in just 30 minutes with the included charger.Despite having a glass back, there’s no wireless charging. While it may be too much to ask for a $350 phone, it would’ve been a nice touch.The Nokia 7.1 is $350, and it’s available from Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H in the U.S. You should know this phone only works on AT&T and T-Mobile, so if you’re on Verizon or Sprint, you’re out of luck.HMD Global offers a standard one-year warranty on the Nokia 7.1 from the date of purchase, which protects the device from manufacturer defects.The Nokia 7.1 has consistently surprised us with its capabilities at its $350 price tag. There are compromises, yes, but It has everything you’d want in a phone: Uncluttered software, satisfactory performance, a capable camera, an affordable price tag, and a great screen with good sound. If you don’t want to spend much on a phone and you’re on AT&T or T-Mobile, the Nokia 7.1 is the phone to buy.There are plenty of phones to consider if you want to spend less than $350, but at this price, the Nokia 7.1 is your best bet in the U.S. The Nokia 6.1 is a good alternative at $270, with decent performance, an acceptable camera, and good build quality. The Moto G6 should also be considered, though we think the 6.1 is the better choice.There’s the Motorola One for $400, which also runs Android One, but it won’t match the Nokia 7.1’s performance. You can’t go wrong with the Nokia 7.1 for its $350 price.The Nokia 7.1 is an Android One phone, so you should see security updates for three years, and at least two Android version upgrades. Android 9 Pie will land at the end of November, making this one of the few budget phones (excluding other HMD phones) with the latest version of Android.We think it should last you a solid two — maybe three — years before you’ll need to upgrade. The battery will start to wear out by then.Absolutely. This is the best phone you can buy under $400."
97,Nokia 3.1,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-31-review/,"The Nokia 3.1 didn’t hit the mark, but our hands-on review of the Nokia 3.1 Plus finds it a much more promising device.The Nokia 6.1 is our favorite budget smartphone under $300, and HMD Global — the company licensing the Nokia brand name and designing these phones — has introduced an even more affordable option to the U.S. market.The Nokia 3.1 comes in at just $160, but even at that price it faces tough competition from the likes of Motorola and Honor. It eschews all frills and attempts to focus on the fundamentals, but HMD has to do better. We’ve been using the phone for a few weeks, and there are a few too many compromises. Let’s take a closer look.The Nokia 3.1 follows the same design cues as its more expensive siblings. There’s no glass on the back — instead you’ll find a phone that’s more utilitarian than stylish.The front of the Nokia 3.1 carries a 5.2-inch display with chunky bezels at the top and bottom. The top bezel is home to a wide-angle 8-megapixel camera along with the 3.1’s only speaker and prominent Nokia logo. The unadorned bottom bezel looks lonely in comparison. There’s a chrome accent line that works that works its way around the display, adding a nice contrasting look, but its continuity is abruptly interrupted on the top and bottom of the phone due to thick, black antenna lines.The IPS LCD display has a 1,440 x 720 resolution with an 18:9 aspect ratio. Colors are a little muted overall, and the display is dim. Even with the brightness cranked all the way up we had trouble seeing the screen outdoors. But for the most part it’s  perfectly adequate. We had no issues streaming Netflix and YouTube, and the screen quality posed no problems.Flip the phone over and you’ll find a black, polycarbonate back with a chrome-accented single-camera lens, flash, and, more Nokia branding. The camera bump is is nearly imperceptible, and the back of the phone is curved ever so slightly, adding a nice ergonomic feel when the phone sits in the hand.On the bright side, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top of the phone.Notice anything missing? If you said “fingerprint sensor,” you’re correct: There’s none to be found on the Nokia 3.1, though there’s plenty of room for one on the bottom bezel or back. It’s a shame HMD decided to sacrifice the fingerprint sensor on the phone as it really removes the convenience we’ve all come to know and love. The Nokia 3.1’s competition have fingerprint sensors — even the $100 Alcatel 1X Android Go phone packs one.While the polycarbonate back will certainly be more durable than glass, it does feel cheap. Tap on the back of the phone and it you won’t get a substantial thud you’ll find on other phones — instead you’re greeted with a hollow ring. This is more a remark than a criticism, as most budget phones we’ve tested in this price range can’t help but feel cheap.On the bright side, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack at the top of the phone. Over on the right is the power and volume buttons, which are made of the same plastic on the back of the phone. The buttons feel a little loose, but they didn’t cause any issues. The bottom of the phone is home to a MicroUSB charging port — which is another disappointment as many Android phones use USB Type-C, but we’ll give HMD a pass as budget phones in the price range still use MicroUSB.The Nokia 3.1 doesn’t look and feel like anything special; it’s basic, the design works, but a fingerprint sensor is sorely missed.The Nokia 3.1 is powered by a Mediatek MT6750N octa-core processor with 2GB of RAM (international models have 3GB). Compared to other budget phones like the Honor 7X or Moto E4 Play, performance is frustrating slow.Two of our benchmarking apps wouldn’t even run.Lag is a constant companion, from unlocking the phone and opening the app drawer to launching apps and opening the camera. There’s also a pronounced stutter when scrolling through apps like Facebook or Twitter that makes the entire experience painful.People who like to play games on their phones may find using the Nokia 3.1 even more infuriating. We were able to play Super Mario Run with just the occasional stutter, but when we attempted PUBG MOBILE, things went south. It was possible to play on the lowest graphics setting, but you probably don’t want to sit through constant lag.Two of our benchmarking apps wouldn’t run on the Nokia 3.1, but here’s what did work:The Nokia 3.1 performed better than the Moto E5 Play and E5 Plus in our benchmark tests, but it came far behind the slightly more expensive Honor 7X. But benchmarks do not tell the full story, and in our review period, we found the 3.1 performed much more poorly than the rest of these devices.The U.S model of the Nokia 3.1 comes with 16GB of storage — which we easily maxed out since Android alone takes up more than half of that storage space. Thankfully, a MicroSD slot lets you add more storage if needed.Perhaps the Nokia 3.1’s best feature is its software. It runs stock Android through the Android One program (Android 8.1 Oreo). The Android One program promises fast software version and security updates for two years, and a clean interface with minimal bloatware. This phone will get Android 9.0 Pie later this year. Most budget phones rarely get updates, so we’re happy to praise a company that puts a priority on issuing updates.It’s hard to expect much when it comes to budget phone camera. They tend to take decent photos in good light, and mediocre to bad photos in low-light scenarios. The Nokia 3.1 bucks that trend, but not in a good way.There’s a 13-megapixel primary camera on the rear with a f/2 aperture, and an 8-megapixel selfie cam with the same aperture on the front. The first batch of photos we took in daylight didn’t just come out blurry, but they had huge lens flares. After cleaning the lens and checking for software updates, we tried again but our tests yielded similar results. Figuring It was a problem with our review unit, we contacted Nokia for a replacement.Our replacement unit didn’t have the same lens flare issue, but the shutter was incredibly slow. To get decent shots in broad daylight, it was necessary to hold the phone still for three seconds after tapping the shutter button — you don’t need to do that with other phones in this price range.Shutter lag aside, our daylight photos managed to look decent. Colors are accurate and details are acceptable, but some of the photos lack depth and appear flat.			Low-light photos are another issue altogether. There was significant noise and detail loss, and we needed to be completely still yet again to avoid any type of blurriness. There are some decent photos in the gallery above in this kind of lighting, but we were only able to capture them after quite a few attempts.We never had high hopes for the Nokia 3.1’s camera, but it certainly surprised us at how lackluster it really is to use.The 2,990mAh battery, of all things, is the shining star on the Nokia 3.1. On an average day, we used the phone to surf the web, scroll through social media, listen to music through Spotify, watch YouTube videos, and we managed to have 40 percent left by 8:30 p.m (after taking it off the charger at 7 a.m.).Unfortunately if you do find yourself running low on battery, there’s no quick charging feature on the phone.The Nokia 3.1 costs $160, and you can purchase it through Amazon or Best Buy. It supports GSM carriers like AT&T or T-Mobile, and it won’t work on CDMA networks like Sprint and Verizon.The phone comes with a standard one-year warranty that covers any manufacturer defects. Water damage, drops, and “Acts of God” are not covered.The Nokia 3.1 is an underwhelming phone in every way. From its low-tier specs, to its mediocre camera, software and battery life are the only things HMD got right on this phone.Yes. Several excellent budget phones have been released this year. The Moto E5 Plus is an excellent alternative if you can find it for less than $200. Since the E5 Plus packs in a better processor and more RAM, you should have a much better experience overall. It also features a massive 5,000mAh battery, meaning you should able to easily get through a day, if not two, between charges. It’s also worth looking at the Moto E5 Play, which can cost as little as $70 depending on your carrier.If you’re willing to spend a little more, you may want to check out the Nokia 6.1. It comes in at $270 and is our favorite budget phone for 2018. The $250 Moto G6 and $200 Honor 7X are also worth considering, and you can learn more about them in our best cheap phones guide.The Nokia 3.1 should last you a year or more. We say that largely because we believe performance will simply get worse the longer you use it, and you’ll likely want to throw the phone out a window.Still, its build quality is good, and the plastic body is more durable than other budget phones with an all-glass body. Since the phone is a part of the Android One program, you can expect regular security and OS updates for two years.No. Even at its low price, the Nokia 3.1 doesn’t offer the performance and reliability we’ve come to expect from HMD."
98,Nokia 3.1 Plus,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-3-1-plus-review/,"HMD Global is making a major push into North America this year, and its first smartphone on a U.S. carrier is the Nokia 3.1 Plus on Cricket Wireless. It’s no flashy flagship — costing just $160 — but you wouldn’t be able to tell it cost so little from using it day-to-day. With fantastic battery life and solid performance, it comes close to being great, but the camera holds this budget smartphone back.The Nokia 3.1 Plus looks and feels like it deserves a higher price tag. It shares a resemblance to many other Nokia phones we’ve seen from HMD, with a centrally-placed vertical camera setup as well as a fingerprint sensor on the back. The blue-and-matte look makes it stand out from the sea of black phones.While it looks good, the Nokia 3.1 Plus feels great. Its heft makes it more substantial. The rear is polycarbonate along an aluminum frame, not glass, which means you can worry less about breaking the phone. The phone feels like a brick, and like Nokia phones of old, you could probably toss it across a room without much damage (but don’t try it, please).The edges are rounded, so the phone can sit comfortably in your hand. It’s large, though, so you might find it tough to reach the top of the screen when holding it with one hand, since it has a tall 18:9 aspect ratio. Those in favor of smaller phones may find it too big.The matte back tends to pick up smudges, but they’re easy to wipe away. The polycarbonate shell is removable. A small lip at the bottom, by the USB-C charging port, helps pry it off. It’s only for inserting a MicroSD card or SIM card. You can’t replace the battery. The MicroSD card will come in handy, as this phone only comes with 32GB of internal storage, which can fill up quickly. You’ll also be happy to see a headphone jack along the top of the phone.The Nokia 3.1 Plus looks and feels like it deserves a higher price tag.Chunky bezels surround the 5.99-inch IPS LCD screen. The top bezel has the earpiece, a Nokia logo, and the selfie camera. The bottom bezel, also known as the “chin,” doesn’t house anything. It doesn’t follow the bezel-less trend for phones, but the Nokia 3.1 Plus doesn’t look too dated. The screen has rounded corners to help it look more modern.The screen boasts 1,440 x 720 resolution. It’s easy to see individual pixels if you bring the phone close to your eyes, but they’re tough to spot at a normal viewing distance. Colors look a little muted, and viewing angles aren’t great, so it’s tough to identify what’s on the screen when looking at it in an angle. Our biggest gripe is that the display is a bit dim, so we had trouble seeing it clearly in broad daylight.The best word for the screen is “adequate.” Videos on Netflix and YouTube never look sharp, and colors look washed out. We compared it with the similarly-priced Moto E5 Plus (also on Cricket Wireless) and found the Motorola phone offered better image quality and more realistic colors, which we preferred over the slightly brighter Nokia phone. We wouldn’t want to use the Nokia 3.1 Plus to binge-watch a whole series, but it’s manageable if you must.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has been available in international markets for some time, but the U.S. model is slightly different. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 processor with 2GB RAM instead of the MediaTek chipset in the global edition. The performance should be comparable, and it’s satisfactory.Everything happens more slowly than on a flagship phone, which is understandable. Apps take a few moments to load and transitioning to another takes a little longer. The fingerprint sensor is finicky, and you may see some stutters when scrolling through apps like Instagram and Twitter. But remembering the $160 price tag, we were surprised at how many everyday tasks we could complete on the Nokia 3.1 Plus.Benchmark scores place this phone higher than other phones in a similar price bracket, like the Moto E5 Plus. That makes sense, as it uses a slightly better processor. In terms of gaming, expect to only play games that don’t require much graphical power. We could hardly get through a game of PUBG: Mobile due to slow frame rates. Games like Breakneck and Alto’s Odyssey were playable, but we had to deal with slight stutters during gameplay. Simpler titles should pose no issue, but this is not ideal for heavy mobile gamers.Simple titles should pose no issue, but this phone is not ideal for heavy mobile gamers.This is not the phone to buy if your job heavily relies on your smartphone and you need to perform tasks quickly. The Nokia 3.1 Plus may surprise you with its capability, but it will require just a little patience. We strongly recommend the OnePlus 6T for people looking for strong performance on a budget, though it’s really in a different league of pricing.Another reasonable option is the Moto G7 Play, which is available in the spring. It’s powered by a Snapdragon 600-series processor, and it only costs $40 more than the Nokia 3.1 Plus.Most Nokia phones from HMD Global run Google’s Android One software, which means it’s the pure, unaltered version of Android straight from Google. That means the phones receive fast version and security updates straight from Google, and there’s almost zero bloatware. Unfortunately, to sell its phones in U.S. carrier stores, HMD had to drop the Android One branding — neither the Nokia 2V on Verizon or the Nokia 3.1 Plus are a part of the program.HMD said it plans to work with carrier partners to deliver fast updates to these phones. We can only hold the company to its word. Thankfully, it has a good track record so far — it’s one of the only manufacturers that has delivered Android Pie (the latest version) to many already-released phones. However, you’ll have to deal with bloatware when you first boot up the Nokia 3.1 Plus. Apps like Amazon Shopping, Candy Crush Friends, Candy Crush Saga, Daily Pedometer, Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, Yahoo! Finance, and more come pre-installed on the phone, eating up valuable storage space. Thankfully, you can uninstall almost all of these and never have to worry about them after setting the phone up.As another positive, the Nokia’s 3.1 Plus does run Android 9 Pie, and it just may be one the cheapest phones around with it. The software interface is dead simple to use, and best of all it looks good.HMD says it plans to work with carrier partners to deliver fast updates.One feature we like about this phone is the inclusion of a near-field communication (NFC) sensor. This is often non-existent on budget phones — see Motorola’s latest Moto G7 range, which costs more than the Nokia 3.1 Plus — but the inclusion here means you can use the Nokia phone for contactless payments via Google Pay, or share files and more through Android’s native Beam technology.The Nokia 3.1 has a dual-camera setup on the back. It’s a 13-megapixel lens paired with a second 5-megapixel lens. This combination allows for Live Bokeh photos — known as Portrait Mode on other phones – but that’s the only bonus feature. Optical zoom is MIA, which we didn’t really expect on such a cheap phone.The specs look fine, but the results sadly fall short. We’ve hardly captured a photo that’s sharp in all our time testing the Nokia 3.1 Plus. Even outdoor photos taken in broad daylight, which budget phones like the Moto E5 Plus and the Nokia 6.1 can handle, look fuzzy. Any kind of movement, whether it’s from the subject or your shaky hands, will produce a blurry photo. The camera has trouble focusing in low-light scenarios, so the photos are often unusable.The Live Bokeh feature produces surprisingly accurate blurred effects around subjects, but they’re not any sharper. The 8-megapixel camera on the front can take decent selfies, but it’s no better than the competition.Decent photos occasionally came out of the Nokia 3.1 Plus, but most of the time we opted to avoid using the camera. It’s disappointing, as there’s a lot to like about the phone, and it’s not like there aren’t better cameras in this price range. The Moto E5 Plus can take better photos, and it costs around the same (depending on where you buy it from), but the new Moto G7 Play that costs $200 should be able to beat out the Nokia 3.1 Plus easily.The camera is the biggest weakness of the Nokia 3.1 Plus.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has a 3,500mAh battery, and the company said the phone should last for two days on a single charge.That’s perhaps a little optimistic with mid-to-high smartphone usage, but for the most part it’s an accurate claim. We often ended the work day with around 50 percent remaining on the phone by 6 p.m. That’s with using it to play games like Breakneck, stream music, capture photos, respond to notifications, and browse social media. We didn’t charge the phone and managed to reach 15 percent by 2 p.m. the next day. With lighter use, the Nokia 3.1 Plus can reach two days of use.In our video playback battery test, the Nokia 3.1 Plus lasted a whopping 6 and a half hours running a YouTube video with brightness cranked to the max. It beats out phones like the iPhone 8, which does have a smaller battery. It’s worth noting the Moto E5 Plus (aka the Moto E5 Supra on Cricket Wireless) has a 5,000mAh battery capacity, so it lasts closer to two full days than the Nokia phone, with the potential to hit three days on a single charge.On a Saturday when we didn’t use the phone much, the phone had 75 percent remaining by 10 p.m. — it does a great job of conserving battery life when in standby mode, which helps.But the best part of the phone is that it has a USB-C charging port. Most budget phones in this range — like the Moto E5 Supra — use MicroUSB ports. USB-C is far more versatile, allows for faster charging. It’s a port used in various products now like laptops too, which means people only need to carry one type of charging cable.The Nokia 3.1 Plus is $160, and is exclusively available from Cricket Wireless in the U.S.HMD Global offers a standard one-year warranty for its products sold in the U.S., which covers manufacturer defects and not much else.There are a lot of good phones you can buy under $300, but the under $200 crowd is still small. The Nokia 3.1 Plus is a solid entry. The performance is decent, battery life is great, and HMD promises to update the phone to new Android versions as they come. But the camera sets it back, negating the small wins it earns over the Moto E5 Plus (like NFC for Google Pay and a USB-C port).We bring up the Moto E5 Plus because it’s our favorite phone under $200, but we’d say you should hold off on purchasing either the Nokia 3.1 Plus or the Moto E5 Plus. The Moto G7 Play, which we’ve brought up already, will offer even greater value — particularly in the performance and camera department — and we believe it’s worth waiting for when it arrives in spring.Our favorite phone under $300 at the moment is the 2018 Nokia 6.1, though the newer G7 Power or standard Moto G7 will likely overtake it after our testing. HMD will be unveiling new phones at Mobile World Congress in 2019, so it’s worth waiting until Feb. 24 to find out if there are new entries to its budget categories that could take over our current favorites.If you absolutely want to own a Nokia phone on a budget, you can’t go wrong with the Nokia 7.1. While it does ratchet the price up to $350, it offers fantastic build quality, a capable camera, and a much better display.The Nokia 3.1 Plus has no water resistance rating, so be sure to keep it away from liquids. It does feel like a brick, so it may be able to withstand drops better than other phones, but a case is always worthwhile.Though the phone isn’t part of the Android One program, HMD promises it will work with Cricket Wireless to push out timely version and security updates. We’ll just have to wait to see if the company comes through. We expect it to last two years, at the least.Only if you’re a diehard Nokia fan and don’t want to spend more than $200. You’ll be disappointed by the camera. If you can spend slightly more, wait for the Moto G7 Play, or HMD’s upcoming MWC announcements."
99,Nokia 6.1,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-6-2018-review/,"It’s becoming increasingly harder to figure out what makes a budget phone cheap. Smartphone manufacturers are quick to introduce high-end flagship features in affordable phones that not only perform well, but look great too. Motorola and Honor are two that have impressed us with the Moto G6 and the Honor 7X lately, but HMD Global has blown us away with the new Nokia 6.1.It has excellent build quality, good looks, solid performance, and a capable camera, all for under $300. The Nokia 6.1 is light on extra features, but it nails the fundamentals, and that’s what you want in a budget phone.With flagship smartphone manufacturers placing a high emphasis on design, budget phone-makers are taking note. This year, it’s all about glass — budget phones from Motorola and OnePlus now sport glass for no other reason than aesthetics. HMD Global — the company that licenses the Nokia brand name — is bucking the trend by sticking with metal.The metal back is cool to the touch. At the top center is a single camera utilizing glass from Zeiss. It sits in an elongated oval module, with a flash at the bottom. Right below it is a circular, recessed fingerprint scanner that’s easy to access. The camera module sticks out ever so slightly, but it’s hardly noticeable, and it doesn’t impact using the phone when it’s laying flat on a table.On the right side of the phone, you’ll find the volume rocker and power button. Both are easy to access, and they offer a satisfying click when tapped. There’s a USB Type-C charging port on the bottom, next to a single, bottom-firing speaker. There’s still a headphone jack at the top of the phone, if you haven’t gone wireless yet.The front of the Nokia 6.1 is dominated by its 5.5-inch LCD display, with a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. The screen is just bright enough to mostly see outdoors, but colors don’t pop or feel vibrant. We didn’t have any major qualms about it, and we think most people will be satisfied with the screen — especially considering its price. We did experience a bug during our testing where an accessibility feature automatically turned on, causing the screen’s colors to look muted. It was an easy fix, but it’s worth noting.It looks elegant, and attractive, especially with the copper accents.Constructed from Gorilla Glass 3, the display slopes ever so slightly around the edges to meet the chassis. It’s a well-thought out addition, as it doesn’t make the phone’s edges sharp. If you’re hoping for bezel-free smartphone, however, you will be disappointed. While the Nokia 6.1 does shave down some of the bezels from last year’s Nokia 6, it still packs chunky top and bottom bezels, and has a more traditional 16:9 aspect ratio. Does it impact everyday use? Not at all. The front just doesn’t look as contemporary as we would have liked.Our biggest qualm about the design is the placement of the mono speaker. It’s on the bottom edge, so it’s easy to block when holding the phone in landscape mode. It does get loud, but the sound quality isn’t going to blow anyone away. We’d have much preferred using that chunky bottom bezel for a front-facing speaker.There are two color options available in the U.S.: Black and white. There’s also an attractive two-tone design with anodized copper and iron accent lines around the display, buttons, camera lens, and fingerprint sensor. It looks elegant, and attractive, especially with the accents. Better yet, the all-metal unibody makes the Nokia 6.1 far more durable than its glass-laden competition. The added heft helps too, by making the phone feel like its worth way more than $270.Looks are only a small part of the equation. You want a budget phone to still run all your favorite apps and games at a smooth pace. We had lots of performance issues with last year’s Nokia 6, but thankfully Nokia took note and upped the processor from the Snapdragon 430 to the Snapdragon 630.HMD said to expect a 60 percent performance bump over last year’s model, and it shows. Moving throughout the Android operating system is relatively quick, though not entirely fluid. Apps don’t open as quickly as they do on flagship phones, but we didn’t run into any major problems with performance on this phone. We’re happily satisfied. The Snapdragon 630 is a better processor than the one powering the $250 Moto G6, which is why we believe the Nokia 6.1 is the best performing phone under $300.There’s also a little more RAM than last year’s Nokia 6 — 3GB to be exact — which should help with juggling multiple tasks. We would have liked to see 4GB here, considering it’s what the $200 Honor 7X packs. There’s also only 32GB of onboard storage — a 64GB option in the U.S. would have been nice — but at least you’ll find a MicroSD card slot that lets you add up to 128GB of space.Here’s a look at a few benchmark scores:The Nokia 6.1 is well ahead of competitors like the Moto G6 and Honor 7X. Its AnTuTu score, for example, bested the 63,311 score from the Honor 7X, and the 70,827 score from the Moto G6. Benchmarks don’t provide a holistic look at how the phone will perform in real life, but it easily reinforces our experience using the phone over the past week.We were able to play games like The Sims: Mobile, and PubG: Mobile on low graphics settings quite well — with just the occasional hiccup interrupting gameplay. If you’re an intense mobile gamer, you may want to go for a more powerful device like the OnePlus 6.Anyone who’s ever had the misfortune of using a smartphone with a wonky Android skin or theme knows how much it can ruin the overall experience. You won’t have that problem with the Nokia 6.1. It’s a part of the Android One program, which means that smartphone manufacturers get to ship the phones with stock Android. It’s the purest version of Android with no bloatware, and no sluggish skin overlaid on top.The additional promise of long-term software updates make the Nokia 6.1 the budget phone to beat.Android One is also a guarantee that the phone will receive timely Android version updates from Google for two years, and security updates for three years from the date the phone is launched. That means you can expect the Nokia 6.1 to get Android P and Android Q.So what’s the software like? It’s relatively quick, and dead simple to use. Swipe right to go to the Google Feed, swipe up to go to your apps, and swipe down to access your notifications drawer. There are only Google apps installed, and a Nokia Mobile Support app, which lets you contact HMD customer service via chat.The software is uncluttered, simple, and it looks great. The additional promise of long-term software updates make the Nokia 6.1 the budget phone to beat, especially considering how some manufacturers tend to ignore updates for lower-priced phones.Last year’s Nokia 6 had a poor camera. It was slow, and largely took blurry photos. We’re happy to say the Nokia 6.1 has a significantly-improved camera that’s actually usable. Like all budget phones, it falls in low-light scenarios, and the lack of any kind of optical image stabilization means you should always try to be as still as possible in lighting that isn’t broad daylight.There’s no dual-camera setup here, but we don’t mind as we haven’t found dual cameras on budget phones to offer all that much more. The Nokia 6.1 has a 16-megapixel lens with an f/2.0 aperture and Zeiss optics. In bright light, we were able to capture great photos with excellent color and detail. In less optimal settings, we still managed to take some decent photos, though graininess quickly creeps in. Photos also tend to start looking a little more washed out, the poorer the lighting.Photos taken at night are subpar. Unless you stay perfectly still, chances are your photos will be blurry. Detail starts to get lost in the grain. Surprisingly, the shutter remains quick to react in almost all lighting conditions.The front-facing camera performs as expected. It’s a wide-angle, 8-megapixel lens with a f/2.0 aperture.  Selfies look good in bright lighting, but the quality degrades by leaps and bounds in low-light situations.Compared to the similarly-priced Moto G6, the camera software may seem lacking on the Nokia 6.1. The Nokia 6.1 does have a Pro mode, but there’s no portrait mode, no beauty filters, and other filters that have become more common on budget phones. These omissions don’t bother us though, since we haven’t found a budget phone that executes any of these features very well.The one special feature that is offered on the Nokia 6.1 camera — and almost all other HMD Nokia phones — is Dual-Sight. With Dual-Sight, you can simultaneously use the front and rear cameras to capture “bothies”. While it may seem a little gimmicky, it actually works very well. We’ve found it to be more useful than some other features on budget phone cameras.The Nokia 6.1’s camera is capable. It’s not going to blow you away like photos from the Huawei P20 Pro, but it will perform admirably, particularly in daylight. We hope HMD can focus on improving low-light photography on the next version of this budget phone.There’s a 3,000mAh battery powering the Nokia 6.1, and we had no problem getting a full day of use out of the phone. That includes messaging, watching YouTube videos, browsing the web, taking photos, and using social media. We even forgot to charge the phone one night, and still managed to get by until the following evening with conservative usage. Expect a full day of use, if not a little more, on this phone.HMD also made some more subtle updates that impressed us as well. You’ll find Bluetooth 5 on board, as well as NFC for contactless payment services like Google Pay.The Nokia 6.1 costs $270 in the U.S., and it’s available now from Best Buy, Amazon, and B&H. The phone only works on GSM networks, so it’s only compatible with carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. It does not work on Sprint or Verizon.It comes with a limited one-year warranty. The warranty only covers defects in workmanship for the handset; it does not cover any normal wear and tear or damage caused by drops or dings. If you need warranty service you’ll need to ship your HMD or take your phone to an authorized service center.The Nokia 6.1 blows us away with a beautiful and durable build, solid performance, and a capable camera in good lighting. Android One makes it even better, with a promise of version and security updates.Maybe. It depends on your budget. If you’re looking for a phone under $300, we recommend the Nokia 6.1. You should also check out the Motorola Moto G6, which costs $250, and the Honor 7X, which will set you back $200. Both of these alternatives are good phones for the price, but the Nokia 6.1 does have superior performance.If your budget stretches a little more, we recommend going for the OnePlus 6. It has flagship-grade performance, a strong camera, and a beautiful, modern design. It costs $530, which still makes it great value.You don’t need a case for the Nokia 6.1, because it truly is built like a tank. It’s doesn’t have any strong water-resistance, though, so you want to be careful with it around water. With continued software updates, we don’t think you’ll need to replace the for two to three years.Yes. The Nokia 6.1 is not perfect, but it’s the best budget phone under $300 we’ve seen to date."
100,Nokia 7 Plus,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-7-plus-review/,"The competition for your money is strong in the world of smartphones, not just in the high-end flagship market. Vying for your cash is the Nokia 7 Plus, a reasonably-priced phone with tempting design and strong specifications, which we liked a lot when it launched at Mobile World Congress 2018.HMD Global, the company with the licence to produce phones with the Nokia name, refers to the Nokia 7 Plus as a flagship phone for everyone. It’s a bold claim, but it easily rings true: There’s smooth performance, simple and bloat-free software, and a promise of Android version and security updates for two years. The phone isn’t available in the U.S. — and there are some other kinks — but for 350 British pounds, the Nokia 7 Plus is too good a phone to ignore.The Nokia 7 Plus is cut from a single piece of 6000 series aluminum, and covered in a ceramic-feel coating on the back. Our review model is black with copper-colored accents, which looks classy, but it may not an aesthetic for everyone.Get closer and you’ll start to see some surprising details. The antenna has been integrated into the edge of the screen, leaving the back free from those ugly antenna lines on other phones. We had no issues with reception, so this works well in our experience.The screen blends smoothly down into a chamfered, diamond-cut body edge, and although the sides are flat, they offer good grip, and the phone is comfortable to hold. It’s not slippery like a glass-bodied phone; the buttons — which sadly lack any texture — fall easily to finger, and the 6-inch screen size is manageable unless you have very small hands.The 6-inch LCD screen comes with an 18:9 aspect ratio, as well as a 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It’s protected by Gorilla Glass 3, and the sides around feature larger bezels than you may expect. It reminds us of the LG G6 and the LG Q6, with curved corners, and a top and bottom section that are equal in size. It’s very attractive.You’ll love looking at the screen on the 7 Plus.The screen gets bright and has great, detailed colors. Photos pop, and watching video is even better. From YouTube to Netflix, the screen excels, and encourages you to watch more. No-one wants to stare at a sub-standard screen, and the Nokia 7 Plus neatly avoids a common pitfall among cheaper phones.Around the back, things stick to the established modern Nokia look. A dual-lens camera sits vertically at the top, with a large flash sensor alongside, and a fingerprint sensor below it. Otherwise, apart from some branding, it’s relatively simple. The Nokia 7 Plus isn’t clamoring for attention. It’s a safe, mature design that won’t cause anyone to get upset — there’s no notch, for example — but it equally won’t make anyone hot under the collar either.This isn’t a bad thing. It’s a reasonably-priced smartphone, not a sports car. But if you put style near the top of your must-have list, then the Nokia 7 Plus may not shout loud enough to make itself known.The dual-lens camera on the back of the Nokia 7 Plus consists of a 12-megapixel, f/1.7 aperture lens and a second 13-megapixel, f/2.6 aperture lens. Both are branded by Zeiss, a long-time Nokia partner with an excellent reputation. On the front, next to a very subtle Nokia logo, is a 16-megapixel selfie camera, again with Zeiss optics.There are two headline features. A bokeh mode, and a Bothie mode. The bokeh mode is essentially what’s known as Portrait Mode on other phones — it blurs out the background around a subject.Sadly, on the Nokia it’s a hit-or-miss if it works. Select the mode and point it at a face, flower, cup, or other object, and usually an alert saying “too near” appears on the screen. No matter how far away you get, this doesn’t change. If you snap the shot anyway, 60 percent of the time the photo will have bokeh. It’s not good at focusing on a subject in bokeh mode either, and often looks past the closest object and focuses on the background instead, missing the whole point. Clearly, software is to blame here, and Nokia will likely correct these problems with an update.Bothies are a fun and effective way of capturing a scene with you in it.Bothies are more successful. This is the common name for the photos taken with Dual Sight mode, which utilizes both the front and rear cameras at the same time, creating a photo using both pictures.Bothies are a fun and effective way of capturing a scene with you in it. But its uses are limited, and it lends itself only to a few situations. We like the way it can be used for stills, video, and live streams though, and it worked really well in our tests.Take photos with the camera as normal and you can get some great results, along with some more mediocre ones. Point it anywhere on a pleasant day, even an overcast one, and the pictures are often excellent. A foggy stroll through Times Square with the Nokia 7 Plus produced some atmospheric images we wanted to share, while another vertical shot looking directly down a New York street in varying lighting came out way better than we expected. However, even with the decent aperture, low-light pictures aren’t spectacular and lack detail.There’s a Pro mode to tinker with, a 2x zoom feature, a selection of basic editing tools, and the video will shoot up to 4K resolution. The 7 Plus does not have optical image stabilization, though it makes do with electronic image stabilization. Shooting 4K video is a shaky affair when walking, but Full HD is considerably better.Considering the price of the phone, the Nokia 7 Plus’ camera is perfectly acceptable. It’s not up there with the best cameras, but we took enough pictures that we wanted to share online, which is proof it’ll satisfy many people. However, the bokeh mode is a serious black mark against the phone’s camera at the moment. Nokia needs to fix it very soon.If the camera’s bokeh mode doesn’t quite hit the spot, the rest of the software is exactly what we want. Nokia has adopted Android One for the Nokia 7 Plus, and almost all its other phones for 2018, and it’s a masterstroke. Android One is a Google-backed, almost completely standard version of Android. That means no bloatware, no messy user interface, and a commitment to delivering security and major platform updates for two years.It’s almost impossible to fault the software on the Nokia 7 Plus, making the camera problems twice as frustrating.The Nokia 7 Plus runs Android 8.1 Oreo, and during our time with the phone, we received the June 2018 Android Security Patch, updating the phone from May’s version. Even the latest phones, aside from Pixel devices and other Android One phones, are months behind. It may sound small, but we often mark down other phones for not delivering timely updates, so it’s important to mention when companies do deliver.The Nokia 7 Plus’s software runs smoothly, and we had no problems with any of our usual apps. It’s also a welcome change to have Google’s Gboard set as the default keyboard, sensibly laid out notifications, and even the option to run the Android P beta if we really wanted. It’s almost impossible to fault the software on the Nokia 7 Plus, making the camera problems twice as frustrating.We ran the usual benchmarks to see how it performed.A Snapdragon 660 processor with 4GB of RAM powers the phone, with 64GB of internal storage space plus a MicroSD card slot expansion. Games are easily playable, but the phone did get quite warm — not hot — especially on the screen; the battery also took a pounding after an hour’s play.The battery has a capacity of 3,800mAh, which is substantial, especially when paired with relatively modest technical specs. We expected it to reach the two-day life quoted by Nokia with ease, but it didn’t quite live up to that, usually reaching a day after a bit of medium use before anxiety forced us to plug in. Use the Nokia 7 Plus hard, and the battery only lasts a day. It’s not terrible by most standards, but we expected more.The phone doesn’t have wireless charging, but it does support Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 through a USB Type-C port on the bottom of the phone. We did notice the standard cable wobbled about when connected, making us worry about the port’s integrity. It didn’t affect charging, but the wobble joined the SIM card tray annoyingly not sitting flush with the frame, both of which let the overall build quality down.The Nokia 7 Plus is available in the U.K. for 350 British pounds (around $465) without a contract through Nokia’s own online store, Amazon, or retailers including Clove Technology. On the high street, it can be purchased through Carphone Warehouse with or without a contract. HMD Global provides a 24-month warranty in the U.K. on the device itself along with all non-removable batteries.A U.S. release for the Nokia 7 Plus hasn’t been announced at the time of writing.The Nokia 7 Plus has a screen you’ll want to gaze at and software you’ll want to use, matched with a mature, classy body you’ll want to hold — all for a competitive price.Are there any alternatives?This is a tough price bracket, and there is plenty of competition for the Nokia 7 Plus. If we look at phones that cost less than $500, the list to check out includes the HTC U11 Life and the Motorola Moto X4, which both come with Android One, plus the Motorola G6 Plus, due to the close-to-standard version of Android installed. Check the Xiaomi Mi A1 for some Android One goodness on an even cheaper phone, if you’re happy to import.However, the biggest challenger to the Nokia 7 Plus is the Honor 10, which costs 400 British pounds. It looks stunning, has a great camera, and plenty of other desirable features. It’s worth the extra money over the Nokia 7 Plus, but it is a different proposition. It’s more showy, and more complicated. The Nokia 7 Plus is mature, and easy to use. Additionally, if you don’t mind spending a little more, the OnePlus 6 comes into range, and we highly recommend it.How long will it last?The Nokia 7 Plus may not be made of glass, but it doesn’t have an especially rugged body, and there’s no IP-rating for water resistance, so you’ll have to be careful with it. The good news is a transparent silicone case comes in the box, and provides plenty of protection for the back and the sides of the phone. You can also check out our guide to the best cases for the Nokia 7 Plus if you want other options.Android One is a benefit for longevity, because it’s assured the phone will get important software updates on a timely basis for two years. We expect the phone to last this long at a minimum (thought it will likely continue performing for a few more years) before you may want to consider upgrading.Should you buy one?Yes, but be aware Nokia needs to fix the problem with the Live Bokeh mode. The issue isn’t quite serious enough to say don’t buy the phone, because apart from this it’s an excellent buy, despite the slightly hobbled battery life. We’ve asked Nokia for feedback on the camera software and battery life, and will update the review when we know more."
101,Nokia 7.1,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-7-1-review/,"Move over, Motorola. There’s a new budget king in town. HMD Global, the company that licenses and creates Nokia smartphones, has slowly but surely been introducing unlocked smartphones in the U.S., and it’s on a roll. It brought the Nokia 6.1 earlier this year — which we consider to be the best smartphone under $300 — and the latest Nokia 7.1 is easily the best phone you can buy under $400. Motorola’s slew of budget phones have been dethroned.The Nokia 7.1 looks and feels like a flagship smartphone, has a fantastic screen with HDR support, performs well, has Android One with a promise of fast updates, and packs a capable camera for the price tag. You can get a lot for $350 these days, but the Nokia 7.1 should be at the top of your list, because it’s close to the perfect budget phone.The Nokia 7.1 exudes a kind of regality not often found in budget phones. It feels as though it costs much more than it does, and that’s largely thanks to the aluminum unibody that feels firm and brick-like, as though it can withstand numerous drops. The edges around the sides are flat, which helps with grip, and the glass on the back and front makes the phone look and feel like a 2018 flagship.While the “toughened glass” back does a lot to further this phone’s aesthetics, there’s no utility, which means there’s no support for wireless charging and there’s a good chance it will crack after a few drops on a hard surface. We suggest buying a case.We’re partial to the Gloss Steel color, but the Midnight Blue looks just as elegant. The back is simple, with a dual-camera module at the top (that sticks out a little), a sensibly-placed fingerprint sensor that’s quick to react, followed by a Nokia and an Android One logo below.There’s also a Nokia logo on the front of the phone — two is a bit excessive. On the blue model, you’ll find silver trimmings around the edges on the front and back, and around the camera module. It adds a bit of flair to an otherwise plain phone, but the copper accents are better on the Gloss Steel.There’s a headphone jack at the top (hear, hear), and a USB Type-C charging port at the bottom alongside a bottom-firing speaker. The power and volume buttons are on the right edge, and they are satisfyingly clicky.The screen makes no compromises; Colors are punchy, there’s good contrast, and the screen is crisp.Flip the phone around and you’ll be greeted with a notch (the cutout housing the selfie camera) at the top, and a sizable bottom bezel or “chin” with the second Nokia logo. This is one of HMD’s few phones with a notch design, and it looks good. The notch isn’t too big, and becomes less noticeable after you use the phone for some time. The bottom bezel is thicker than we’d like — it’s no Honor 8X – you’ll get used to it, too. Regardless, we’re happy to see the edge-to-edge design make its way to HMD’s budget phones.The screen comes in at 5.84 inches, and we love the size. It’s similar to the iPhone XS, which we lauded for being the perfect size for a smartphone. It’s easy to reach all parts of the screen (your mileage may vary), and the 19:9 aspect ratio means it’s a very narrow phone, making it manageable to hold in one hand.HMD hit the build quality and design of this phone out of the park with the Nokia 7.1. This is an affordable phone in the body of a flagship.The Nokia 7.1 has an LCD screen (protected by Gorilla Glass 3) with a resolution of 2,280 x 1,080, and it’s one of the highlights of the phone. It’s colorful and sharp, though black levels aren’t deep. We haven’t had an issue with the screen’s brightness, as we’ve been able to see it well outdoors. It can also become dim when required, which is perfect for reading in bed at night.HMD has somehow brought a flagship feature down to this $350 phone: Support for HDR10. That means you can enjoy wider color support and stronger contrast when watching HDR-supported content through apps like Netflix and YouTube. The screen also automatically converts any standard definition (SD) content into HDR. It’s not a dramatic difference, but it’s noticeable and it looks better than SD (you can turn this off if you don’t like it).The screen makes no compromises. Colors are punchy, there’s good contrast, and the screen is crisp – This is a great phone for watching videos and movies.The Nokia 7.1 easily performed all the tasks we expect from our flagship phones.What about audio? There’s a single bottom-firing speaker, which is easy to block when holding the phone in landscape mode. Still, we’re impressed by how loud these speakers get, and surprised at the quality. It’s nothing like the stereo sound the Razer Phone 2 pumps out, but it sounds full-bodied and rich, though bass is weak. The headphone jack is always there when you want to plug in.The Nokia 7.1 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 processor, with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and a MicroSD card slot in case you need more space. A 3GB RAM and 32GB storage option is also available — just not in the U.S.We’ve been using this phone for more than two weeks, and it easily performed all the tasks we expect from our flagship phones. It zipped through the Android operating system and ran all our favorite apps. We did notice an occasional hiccup, though, and the phone can slow down a little when you juggle multiple tasks at the same time.Most games run well on this phone, but you may have issues with titles that are graphics-heavy. We played Alto’s Odyssey and Tekken, and while both performed admirably, there were moments when they stuttered a little — especially when notifications came through.The AnTuTu score is well ahead of budget competitors like the Moto G6 Plus (90,483), Moto G6 (70,827), and it even bests the pricier Moto Z3 Play (110,949).We’re happy with the Nokia 7.1’s performance. Its satisfactory day-to-day capabilities make it perfect for the average person.The Nokia 7.1 runs Android One, a version of Android straight from Google without any bloatware. It’s uncluttered, simple to use, and moving throughout the OS is quite speedy. It’s running Android 8.1 Oreo at the moment, but HMD said the phone will receive an update to Android 9 Pie by the end of November.That’s the other benefit of Android One. There’s a promise of fast version updates for two years, and security updates for three years. That helps keep your phone up to date and secure, which is rare for phones in this price range.Budget phones often falter when asked to snap photos. The Nokia 7.1 proves otherwise, and while low-light performance isn’t its strong suite, it’s capable enough. It has two lenses on the back, both with Zeiss optics. The primary is a 12-megapixels lens with a f/1.8 aperture, and it’s paired with a 5-megapixel lens for depth sensing.The camera is quick to launch, though there’s a small delay when snapping pictures. You must be very still to keep a image in focus, otherwise you’ll end up with a blurry shot. Photos in general deliver accurate colors, and daylight shots are surprisingly detailed. There’s good HDR for most situations, though the sky can sometimes look blown out.In low-light environments, details quickly deteriorate, but colors are solid, and photos don’t look too noisy. The camera does have trouble focusing in dark conditions.Now we need to talk about the phone’s biggest weakness. Battery life.Portrait Mode is available on the back camera, as well as the front 8-megapixel selfie camera. Again, you need to stay still to make sure the photo isn’t blurry, but results are solid. The cameras do a great job of identifying the edges of a subject, struggling only slightly with hair.The camera has an easy-to-use Pro mode that lets you adjust settings, and HMD’s “Bothie” mode is available, which lets you snap a photo with the rear and front camera at the same time. It’s a fun feature that lets you stay in the shot while capturing the action.Overall, this is easily among the best cameras you’ll find in a smartphone of this price. Optical image stabilization would improve the experience, but we’re quite satisfied with the photographs the 7.1 produces.So far, so good, but now we must talk about the phone’s biggest weakness. Battery life.The Nokia 7.1 has consistently surprised us.On most days (with medium to light use), we were able to squeeze out a full day of use out of the 3,060mAh battery, with around 30 percent remaining by 6 p.m. That’s an average of 3.5 hours of screen-on time.But on more demanding days, with gaming, photos, music and video streaming, and a lot of instant messaging, the phone came close to dying around by 4 or 5 p.m. — if we wanted to stay out late, we had to plug it into an external battery pack to make sure it lasted the night. That happened on two occasions.Luckily, the phone charges quickly. HMD says it can hit 50 percent with just 30 minutes of charging, and that’s the speed we saw in tests. We plugged in the phone at 18 percent, and it hit 60 percent in just 30 minutes with the included charger.Despite having a glass back, there’s no wireless charging. While it may be too much to ask for a $350 phone, it would’ve been a nice touch.The Nokia 7.1 is $350, and it’s available from Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H in the U.S. You should know this phone only works on AT&T and T-Mobile, so if you’re on Verizon or Sprint, you’re out of luck.HMD Global offers a standard one-year warranty on the Nokia 7.1 from the date of purchase, which protects the device from manufacturer defects.The Nokia 7.1 has consistently surprised us with its capabilities at its $350 price tag. There are compromises, yes, but It has everything you’d want in a phone: Uncluttered software, satisfactory performance, a capable camera, an affordable price tag, and a great screen with good sound. If you don’t want to spend much on a phone and you’re on AT&T or T-Mobile, the Nokia 7.1 is the phone to buy.There are plenty of phones to consider if you want to spend less than $350, but at this price, the Nokia 7.1 is your best bet in the U.S. The Nokia 6.1 is a good alternative at $270, with decent performance, an acceptable camera, and good build quality. The Moto G6 should also be considered, though we think the 6.1 is the better choice.There’s the Motorola One for $400, which also runs Android One, but it won’t match the Nokia 7.1’s performance. You can’t go wrong with the Nokia 7.1 for its $350 price.The Nokia 7.1 is an Android One phone, so you should see security updates for three years, and at least two Android version upgrades. Android 9 Pie will land at the end of November, making this one of the few budget phones (excluding other HMD phones) with the latest version of Android.We think it should last you a solid two — maybe three — years before you’ll need to upgrade. The battery will start to wear out by then.Absolutely. This is the best phone you can buy under $400."
102,Nokia 8 Sirocco,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-8-sirocco-review/,"Ever since HMD started producing smartphones with the Nokia brand name, its designs have more or less been utilitarian. A tough protective metal frame around a single aluminum unibody, with a fairly straightforward rear and front design. Well, the company thinks it’s ready to change things up with its first luxury smartphone, the Nokia 8 Sirocco.If you recall the Sirocco name, it’s from when Nokia used to differentiate some of its special edition feature phones, like the Nokia 8800 Sirocco. Well, the Nokia 8 Sirocco certainly is something special. Let’s take a closer look.The Nokia 8 Sirocco is wrapped in Gorilla Glass 5, with a stainless steel frame in between. Stainless steel is tougher than aluminum, which is used in most phones, and it also makes the phone look and feel a tad more luxurious.The first thing you’ll notice, however, is how compact the Sirocco feels. The minimized edges around the screen really do make the 5.5-inch form factor feel small. Better yet, the phone is thin at 7.5mm, but the edges curve into the stainless steel frame, with the thinnest point being just 2mm.It’s quite an experience holding the Nokia 8 Sirocco, because it feels futuristic, and the edges are razor thin. It’s just plain cool to hold and stare at. The sides of the phone do feel a little too sharp, but we’ll have to use the phone a little longer to decide if it’s detrimental to the smartphone experience. What we certainly didn’t like were the buttons — they’re flush against the right edge of the Sirocco, so not only is it difficult to quickly locate them, but they’re tough to press without making sure you exert a certain amount of pressure.The software is slick, simple, and fast, and the promise of updates is always good to hear from any Android manufacturer.The rear side of the phone is a little too glossy because of the glass, and it attracts plenty of fingerprints, but that’s a problem with most flagship smartphones these days. There’s a dual-camera system on the top, a fingerprint sensor below it, as well as the Nokia and Android One logos below. We’re hoping the certification labels aren’t going to sit at the very bottom, because it sort of clutters the look of the device.There’s a USB-Type C charging port on the bottom, and HMD thinks it’s also time to get rid of the headphone jack, sadly.Overall, we love the look of the phone. It feels compact and comfortable to grip in the hand, and we like how the curved edges don’t blend as much into the frame as the Galaxy S9, which sometimes interrupts usability. We’ll certainly have to use it for a longer period of time to see if the razor-sharp edges continue to bother us.The Nokia 8 Sirocco mostly has the flagship specifications you’d expect — except for the processor. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chip, which was the flagship processor of choice for many smartphones last year. 2018 is the year of the Snapdragon 845, so it’s a little odd that HMD’s flagship phone doesn’t have the latest processor on board.In terms of actual performance, though, you won’t see a problem with the 835 at all. Apps opened quickly, and moving through the operating system felt fast. There’s 6GB of RAM on board, which is more than enough, as well as 128GB of internal storage. There’s no MicroSD card slot, which may be disappointing for some, but again, 128GB is plenty for the average person.The P-OLED 2,560 × 1,440 pixel resolution on the 5.5-inch screen looks vibrant, colorful, and incredibly sharp — perfect for viewing movies and videos.The glass back allows for Qi wireless charging, and a 3,260mAh battery should keep the phone going strong for about a full day. The phone is also IP67 water-resistant, which means it should still survive submersion up to a meter underwater for 30 minutes.The camera system is also surprisingly fast to react. There’s a 12-megapixel camera accompanying a 13-megapixel telephoto lens on the rear — with Zeiss optics — which adds a 2x optical zoom feature, to shoot subjects that are further away, as well as a bokeh portrait mode. We saw virtually no shutter lag, though there was a little blur in the low-light environment we were shooting in.It’s the “bothie” feature that caught our eye. Debuting last year on the Nokia 8, it lets you take photos or videos with the 5-megapixel front camera and the rear camera at the same time, perfect for trying to capture reaction and action at the same time. It worked incredibly well with an easy-to-use interface, offering high-quality photos at the touch of a button.The new Pro Mode is a nice addition as well. Swipe up from the shutter icon and you can get access to manual controls for the camera. It’s well-laid out and easy to slide the toggles to get the settings you want. This feature will be available on all Nokia phones with Zeiss optics.But perhaps best of all, the Nokia 8 Sirocco runs Android One. That doesn’t just mean you get stock Android with no bloatware apps — you also get access to fast security and Android version updates.The software is slick, simple, and fast, and the promise of updates is always good to hear from any Android manufacturer.The Nokia 8 Sirocco will cost a whopping 750 euros (about $922). You can certainly get equal or better specifications for the price, such as with the Galaxy S9, but it may be worth the cost. We’re quite happy with the design, the camera is promising and has quite a few must-have features, and you’re guaranteed immediate updates.The Sirocco will be available in April 2018, but there’s no word of a U.S. release."
103,Nokia 8110 4G,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/nokia-8110-4g-review/,"Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone! No, I’m not crazy. That song came to mind as soon as I managed to squeeze through a pack of photographers to spend some time with HMD Global’s banana pho — er, I mean feature phone. If you recall the popular Nokia 8110 that was released back in 1996 (the one Keanu Reeves used in The Matrix), well you’re in for a blast from the past because it’s back with an updated design, 4G connectivity, and far more smarts than any other feature phone.There are 1.3 billion people in the world that use feature phones — dumb phones that don’t do much else than make calls and send texts — and in less than a year, HMD Global has proclaimed itself the No. 1 manufacturer for these types of phones. That’s largely because it’s licensing the Nokia brand name, which clearly still holds a lot of value to quite a number of people. The Nokia 3310 was the first feature phone HMD revived last year, and now the spotlight falls on the Nokia 8110. But this “dumb” phone isn’t a gimmick, because there’s a lot more to it than meets the eye.The black Nokia 8110 4G is subtle and attractive, but there’s no denying the hypnotic lure of the banana yellow color; it’s a bright yellow that’s not afraid to stand out. Compared to last year’s 3310, the 8110 is a lot bigger, especially when you slide out the cover to reveal the keypad. It’s still compact compared to any modern smartphone, and the curved back easily makes the Nokia 8110 one of the most ergonomic phones, as it fits in the palm of your hand perfectly.It’s made of plastic, and so it feels a little like a toy. The buttons are all clicky enough, though you may need to exert a little extra pressure on the power button on the top right. Sliding the cover down is fun, and we’re sure it will be even more exciting to hang up calls by sliding it back up again.This dumb phone isn’t a gimmick, because there’s a lot more than meets the eye.It took a few minutes to get used to the buttons — the end call button is the back button, and you can tap the top left, center, and right keys to navigate different menus and the app drawer. The software was responsive, and we didn’t notice any kind of slowdown. It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 205 processor, which we honestly have never used before, but it feels capable enough for the low-power tasks commanded by the 8110.The 2.4-inch screen isn’t too sharp, but it’s bright and handily did the job in our quick tests. Don’t expect much at all from the 2-megapixel camera on the back, but it’s there in case you need it. There’s also 4GB of internal storage to store some music and files.The phone has a 1,500mAh battery, which HMD said offers a standby time of 25 days. That’s a big incentive for these feature phones as secondary devices to your smartphone — especially when traveling.What’s unique about the Nokia 8110 4G is how, at launch, you’ll be able to download and use Google Maps, Google Search, and Google Assistant, as well as Facebook and Twitter. The phone doesn’t run Android — instead it runs an operating system called KaiOS — but HMD worked with these companies to bring these apps to the phone, and there’s even an app store where you’ll be able to download even more apps. KaiOS is aimed at being super light-weight, and can perform on phones with as little as 512MB of RAM, though a version for phones with 256MB is coming later this year.This is the most interesting feature about the phone, but sadly none of the demo units at the press conference had these services installed or available. A representative said they will be available when the phone launches. We can’t wait to see how Google Assistant, an artificially intelligent assistant, works on a feature phone. Snake was installed, and the experience is the same as it was on the Nokia 3310.You’ll also be able to sync your email, contacts, and calendar through Gmail and Outlook. Since it can use 4G networks, you can also turn the 8110 into a hot spot to provide data for other devices.The Nokia 8110 4G will only cost 79 euros ($97 U.S.), and it will be available in April 2018. It’s unclear whether it will be available in the U.S., but we expect it to eventually arrive stateside sometime later this year.We’ll have to wait and see how those smart features perform on this phone, but so far the Nokia 8110 4G may just be the ultimate backup phone to your smartphone.Updated on February 26: Added information that phone runs KaiOS."
104,OnePlus 6,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6-review/,"How does OnePlus keep coming up with a desirable smartphone that people will still want to buy, every six months or less? There are companies out there that struggle to do it on an annual basis, after all. OnePlus has a release schedule that would terrify big-name brands bogged down by focus groups, middle managers, and multiple checklists. Its latest phone — the OnePlus 6 — arrives only a few months after the OnePlus 5T, which also came a few months after the OnePlus 5.It’s a lot of pressure. Can OnePlus continue its winning streak with another swiftly-launched smartphone?Updated on July 3: We’ve continued to use the OnePlus 6 and have added more insight into the battery, camera, speed, and audio performance. While we continue to be impressed, the score hasn’t changed.The OnePlus 6 showcases how OnePlus is able to attract new buyers and upgraders even with such a rapid update schedule — it taps into the latest trends, integrates them quickly into a new phone, and gets it out the door before any fads pass. That means the OnePlus 6 has a glass body, which is the definition of premium this year, a notch at the top of the screen, and a vertically-mounted, dual-lens camera.OnePlus has outdone itself with the all-glass body — the second time it has used glass since the OnePlus X. It looks and feels superb: It’s soft and smooth, with a cool touch. It’s very reflective too, mostly on the mirror black model you see here, and we’d say it’s closer to the water-like finish on the Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS than phones like the Honor 10 and the Moto G6. Even the Galaxy S9 looks a bit muddy next to the OnePlus 6. To commemorate its 4th anniversary, the OnePlus 6 brings back the “Designed by OnePlus” branding on the back panel, which is the only other mark aside from the OnePlus logo. It’s minimal, like we have come to expect, and it looks great on the mirror black model.OnePlus has outdone itself with the all-glass body.The glass body hasn’t made the phone overly slippery, and it’s easy to hold with one hand. Using it is a harder task due to the size of the screen. It’s a stretch to get to the opposite corner with your thumb.The notch (the cutout at the top of the screen housing the front camera and earpiece) is the subject of much (now rather boring) controversy. OnePlus told Digital Trends that its inclusion is the most effective way of getting a far larger screen on the phone than usual, while maintaining a similar size to previous OnePlus phones. If you hate the notch, a software setting hides it away.The screen’s big alright, measuring 6.28-inches with a 2,280 x 1,080 pixel resolution, another first for the OnePlus family. There aren’t too many phones close to this screen size other than the Galaxy Note 8. Surprisingly, the phone is very compact, with minimal side bezels and chin. We like the shape of the screen corners too, which have a flowing curve before running down the sides.The fingerprint sensor is on the back, and we’re pleased to see it has been given a stadium shape and a chamfered edge: A big improvement over the OnePlus 5T. Little things like this, along with the curved screen edges, make the OnePlus 6 look and feel fantastic.If you hate the notch, a software setting hides it away.Another ergonomic improvement is the iconic OnePlus Alert slider, which controls device notifications and silent mode. It has been shifted to the top right edge. While lefties won’t like the change, right-handed folks will find it more comfortable. It’s a bit stiff, and requires a firm grip on the phone to slide, even with the textured edge on the slider itself.Along the bottom edge of the phone is a USB Type-C port for fast charging, using OnePlus’ Dash Charge system, along with a 3.5mm headphone socket for those still attached to wires. Sadly, there’s no support for wireless charging.On the back is a dual-lens rear camera, this time centrally-and-vertically-mounted inside a slight camera bump. The main f/1.7 aperture, 16-megapixel lens is joined by a second 20-megapixel camera, complete with a portrait mode. New bokeh effects have been added to the portrait mode, adding stars, hearts, and bubbles to the background.It’s controlled by OnePlus’ own camera app, which is simple and easy to use. OnePlus has added a slow-mo video mode, which has a maximum of 480fps at 720p, meaning it can’t slow the world down as effectively as the Galaxy S9, Huawei P20 Pro, or Sony Xperia XZ2. A 1080p resolution mode is available at 240fps. As you’d expect, this means it’s not quite so dramatic, and shooting at 240fps in 1080p doesn’t make much of a difference. Use the 480fps setting for a better feeling of slow-motion.You can edit videos in the app, trim the clip down, add music, or a filter. It’s not as wide-ranging as the modes provided by the LG V30, but it’s more than many other phones provide. What’s more is it’s very simple to use. This is key for editing video or stills, and it’s great to see OnePlus implement an edit mode that not only works for video, but for stills too. Yes, you can use apps like Snapseed, but not having to leave the gallery app is a time-saver. The features are also comprehensive.Taking photos on a sunny London day produced some great shots, with bright blue skies and detail in the shadows.  We didn’t see much over-the-top HDR-style glow which has become more common on many devices today. However, a degree of grain is evident in some scenes. The return of optical image stabilization, and the f/1.7 aperture bodes well for low-light photography, and some pictures we took at the phone’s launch — which was in a very dark event space — returned great black levels, and still coping well with the spotlight on OnePlus’s Carl Pei on stage.In lowlight the OnePlus 6 surprises with its ability. We took several photos in Paris, with plenty of ambient light around, and it brought out some stunning colors, and didn’t miss out on much background detail either, even when zoomed in. It did tend to make the sky a little too blue though. Nit-picking aside, the night photos were definitely ones we would want to share.The bokeh mode, which doesn’t use a telephoto lens like many other phones resulting in a picture that isn’t cropped, works relatively well. OnePlus has pushed several updates out that address early issues with the performance, and it’s considerably faster now, and quickly recognizes the primary object in the frame before blurring the background. Shooting photos of simple objects, like flowers, demonstrates the OnePlus 6’s ability to capture an object accurately.Portrait mode has also been added to the selfie camera, although it’s purely software driven due to the single camera lens on the front of the OnePlus 6. The results are acceptable, but not outstanding. For example, it will often blur out the edge of spectacle frames if your head is at an angle. However, this is not a unique problem to the OnePlus 6, and phones including the iPhone X also have difficulty here. When the OnePlus 6 gets the portrait selfie right, the photos look good, although skin tones are lighter than we usually prefer.A Snapdragon 845 processor with a whopping 8GB of RAM keeps our test model running, and the OnePlus 6 has been lightning fast in our continued experience. It all feels very refined. OnePlus uses the tagline, “The speed you need,” for the 6, and we cannot imagine anyone thinking the phone may not have the guts to cope with a task. It’s not just marketing either. Everything about the OnePlus 6 is fast, from the face unlock to whizzing around the operating system. Not once did it feel like it was about to get bogged down, or our activities were getting too much. It really has got all the speed you need.We ran some benchmark tests:These scores are very impressive, easily surpassing the OnePlus 5T from last year, plus the Galaxy S9 Plus and LG G7 ThinQ from 2018, which have the same Snapdragon 845 processor. It also exceeds the Huawei P20 Pro, which has the Kirin 970 chip inside. It should be noted the OnePlus 6 may have specially-tuned software to perform well in these tests. This doesn’t detract from its monstrous results.One notable feature that shouldn’t be ignored is the OnePlus 6’s audio performance. The phone supports AptX HD, which when paired with a pair of compatible headphones and suitable hi-res music tracks, sounds simply fantastic. We’ve been using the phone with the Bowers & Wilkins PX over-ear headphones and streaming music service Tidal, and the results are sublime. While OnePlus’s own Bullets Wireless headphones are good value and sound great, they do not demonstrate what a great music machine the OnePlus 6 can be, provided you spend a little more.Android 8.1 Oreo with version 5.1.8 of OnePlus’s OxygenOS — updated from version 5.1.2 at launch — over the top is smooth and fuss-free, with only a handful of pre-installed apps. There’s also the slide-in Shelf, which contains recently-used apps, contacts, and other information, making it look a little different to standard Android found on a Pixel 2.Any alterations and special features are all options. A new gesture control system replaces the familiar Android Home, Back, and Menu keys with an iPhone X-like swipe system. It’s not great, and we found swiping on either side of the screen to go back a step frustrating and unreliable. The traditional Android keys may not be pretty, but they work, and that’s what matters.Face unlock isn’t a substitute for a fingerprint sensor in certain apps.The fingerprint sensor is under the camera lenses on the back of the phone and is super fast. We’ve had the OnePlus 6 in a case — one of the new official OnePlus cases — and did find it harder to locate accurately due to the amount of recess, so it may be worth checking this for comfort before deciding on a case for the phone. OnePlus’s successful face unlock feature returns, and is reliable and ultra-fast. However, it’s not secure, and isn’t a substitute for a fingerprint sensor in certain apps.The OnePlus 6 has a 3,300mAh battery, which we’ve had at least a day’s use out of during our tests. It won’t take us to two days with a single charge, but the phone won’t give up over the course of a long, 15-hour day, meaning a day-and-a-half of sensible use is possible.What’s certain is that even if you do find yourself short of battery life, the Dash Charge fast charge system tops it up quickly. OnePlus promises a day’s worth of power after 30 minutes on charge, and that’s relatively accurate, although your definition of a day may vary from theirs. With 60 percent charge, the phone would return about six hours with moderately heavy use, including Bluetooth audio streaming and photos. This only works with the included charger and adapter.Has the OnePlus 6 been subject to a price rise that takes it out of the realms of affordability? The price has gone up, but not so drastically you’ll have to think twice. The 8GB/128GB model we’ve been using is $580, or 520 British pounds. A cheaper model with 6GB/64GB storage costs $530 or 470 pounds. Finally, the 256GB version is $630 or 570 pounds and also has 8GB of RAM. The mirror black version seen in our pictures is joined by a midnight black model, along with limited edition silk white and red models, both of which only come in 8GB/128GB configuration for the same price.In the U.S. OnePlus has a one-year warranty on its devices. In the U.K. this is extended to two-years. Phones with any manufacturing defects will be repaired or replaced free of charge, with shipping and handling costs included. If you damage the phone through mistreatment, or general wear-and-tear, it won’t be covered.The fact OnePlus puts out such a polished product so often is exciting to see. This lightning speed doesn’t affect its quality, or commitment to delivering a satisfying, desirable smartphone.An alternative? If you’re set on not spending more than $530 and want something comparable, then no. Price is where OnePlus wins. It’s almost impossible to find the same level of power, style, and ability for the same amount of money. We’re inundated with phones that cost at the minimum $700 ($950-plus isn’t uncommon either), yet the OnePlus 6 manages to squeeze in the key features for several hundred dollars less. It’s closest competitor remains the Honor View 10. And the new Moto Z3 Play is worth a look.If price is no object, and you just want the best phone for you, then the OnePlus 6 faces tremendous competition, because the standard of smartphones released recently is so high. The Galaxy S9 Plus wins points for its design and camera, the Pixel 2 XL for its software and camera, the Huawei P20 Pro for its best-in-class camera, and the new and relatively reasonably-priced LG G7 ThinQ are all strong alternatives you’ll enjoy owning.There is an excellent chance of the OnePlus 6 remaining powerful enough to last for considerably more than two years. OnePlus does support its phones with regular software updates too, plus it’s one of the phones on Google’s Android P beta list, so you can even try out the very latest version of Android when you buy it.Inside the box is a basic case, so you can protect the beautiful finish and keep it safe in the event of a short drop, plus the body has basic splash proofing. It won’t survive a bath, but it can be used in the rain and won’t wince at the hint of a wet table.Yes, of course you should buy the OnePlus 6, it’s a no-brainer. The price has risen again, but it’s still cheaper than any other high-end phone out there. It doesn’t sacrifice what matters — speed, build quality, design, and features you want to use. If that’s not a reason to hand over your cash, we don’t know what is."
105,OnePlus 6T,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oneplus-6t-review/,"Editor’s note: OnePlus has launched the OnePlus 7 Pro, its new flagship, for $670. It has a larger screen and better performance than the OnePlus 6T, but the older phone’s price has dropped to compensate. It now starts at $500 and is still a solid mid-range pick.Like changing the clocks for daylight savings, the biannual OnePlus launch has become so regular that we almost take it for granted. Despite this clockwork-like frequency, we still find ourselves caught up in the hype and excitement — much of it generated by the masterful OnePlus marketing team — and full of anticipation for the new model.This is the OnePlus 6T, and like previous T models it’s not a giant leap over the product it replaces. Does that mean our anticipation has been quelled? Has the seemingly endless wave of new OnePlus phones become so much that we’re now not all that bothered by a new one? It has to happen at some point, right? Well that day hasn’t come yet. The OnePlus 6T is so good, it doesn’t need the hype.What if the last phone you released was a bit of a looker, and you don’t want to mess things up for the sequel. What do you do? If you’re OnePlus you take basically the same shape and design, put a more sensibly shaded rear panel on, then alter the two least attractive aspects of the old model: the notch and the fingerprint sensor. The result? The OnePlus 6T, and the phone is a stunner.The mirror black seen on the OnePlus 6 has returned, along with a less reflective midnight black version that shifts between inky black and a shiny gunmetal grey in the light. Get it just right, and a subtle S pattern emerges to finish off the effect. The OnePlus 6T doesn’t need crazy colors, it’s happy being classier than a whole room full of people who’ve just graduated from etiquette school.Look back at the OnePlus 6 and the notch stands out, and not in a good way. It looks bizarrely dated for a phone that only came out earlier this year. The OnePlus 6T’s notch is a tiny dewdrop, and contains only the selfie camera lens. The speaker is set just above that in the body itself; it’s less intrusive, it’s prettier, and it doesn’t mess with notification icons too much either. We’d call that a success.There are still bezels around the screen and a small chin, but they’re well disguised and don’t detract from the look of the phone greatly. On the back, the dual-lens camera is the only blemish, as the fingerprint sensor is now part of the display. Until now, we’ve only seen this on a few phones, with Huawei most recently pushing wider adoption with the Mate 20 Pro. More on that a little later. New for the 6T is the removal of the headphone jack, which OnePlus said is a reflection of how the industry is headed, and while sure to bother some, it is a necessity due to the device’s internal design.Adopting and combining symmetry with minimalism, along with sensible design alterations like moving the trademark notification slider above the sleep/wake key on the right, OnePlus has been refining its overall design for several device generations now. Slightly heavier than the OnePlus 6 in the best way possible — it has a larger battery — but no less comfortable to hold, the OnePlus 6T takes a strong design and improves in all the areas where it lacked before. It’s one of the best looking smartphones you can buy.The in-display fingerprint sensor has been dream technology since we first saw it on concept phones last year. Now that these sensors are here, what’s it like to use one every day? OnePlus has built the sensor into the very base of the screen, and claims it’ll unlock the device in 350ms. It does so with an eye-catching animation and a bright green light, which OnePlus says increases the accuracy over other colors.It’s one of the best looking smartphones you can buy.In reality, it’s a mixed bag, as it seems to get confused over time. When it’s working at its best, we’re talking lightning fast. It’s not as reliable as a traditional fingerprint sensor though, and we have removed and rescanned our fingerprint several times, as the accuracy dropped for no apparent reason. Doing so saw the sensor return to its former glory, but for how long until we have to do it again, we don’t know.OnePlus has added its super-fast face unlock feature too, and if you activate this, the screen is usually unlocked before you even get your finger near the in-display sensor. It’s not a secure option though, so you won’t want to solely rely on it.The OnePlus 6T has a 6.41-inch, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, AMOLED Full Optic screen with a 2,340 × 1,080 pixel resolution, for an 86-percent screen-to-body ratio. It’s covered in Gorilla Glass 6 — one of the first phones to use it — which provides six individual layers of protection. The screen is slightly larger than the one on the OnePlus 6.We love all the many tweaks OnePlus has added to the display settings, from its very effective adaptive brightness to a varied screen calibration setting. We left our phone in Adaptive Mode, which alters the contrast and brightness based on lighting conditions, and found it really useful. A night mode and a reading mode are also present, plus the option to hide the notch, if you for some reason still find it objectionable.It’s bright, attractive, and looks great for gaming, YouTube, and Netflix. However, it doesn’t seem to have quite the same level of luster we’ve seen in the very best screens of 2018, notably the Galaxy Note 9 and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. You’ll probably only notice when comparing them alongside, and considering the OnePlus 6T costs less than those two devices, it’s not a huge issue.Our OnePlus 6T has Android 9.0 Pie with Oxygen OS 9.0.3 installed over the top. It’s worth pointing out how close Oxygen OS is to a Pixel-style Android experience, right down to the welcome inclusion of Google’s Gboard keyboard. What’s new? There’s a Gaming Mode, where notifications can be blocked, brightness is set to maximum automatically, and extra network data gets piped to whatever connected game you’re playing. Notifications arrive in a ticker-tape style display, to minimize intrusion.The OnePlus 6T seems to have the best camera we’ve seen from the company.Like the display settings, there are plenty of options to make Oxygen OS your own. There are four options for the ambient display clock, the option to run parallel apps like two versions of WhatsApp or Facebook, and also an encrypted locker to hide apps away, and to not show notifications either. There are even three different animations for the in-display fingerprint sensor as it scans. Unlike other deeply customized versions of Android, these are all options, and they aren’t intrusive.The OnePlus 6T’s full screen nature lends the device to being used with a gesture control system, much like the iPhone XS and the system Huawei introduced with EMUI 9. It’s an option, and not set as default, but it does feel more natural to use than the Android buttons at the bottom of the screen. Why? Because the phone is all screen, and tapping those buttons is awkward when the device doesn’t have a chin to hold on to.A center swipe returns to home, a swipe up and hold reveals the app switcher, and swiping on the left or right of the screen goes back. Despite it making more ergonomic sense, it’s not the best gesture control method we’ve tried. You do have to be very precise with the back swipe — from the bottom of the screen or it won’t always register — and the app switcher requires effort to reveal, otherwise you just go back to home.We experienced no stability or speed issues with Oxygen OS, but will continue using the phone over the coming weeks to build a better picture of medium to long-term use.The OnePlus 6T has a Snapdragon 845 processor and 6GB or 8GB of RAM. The choice for buyers is either 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB, or a range-topping 8GB/256GB configuration.Here’s how it fared in benchmarks:These figures surpass the OnePlus 6, the Galaxy S9 Plus, the Galaxy Note 9 the LG G7 ThinQ, and the Pixel 3 XL. OnePlus has specially tuned its software for benchmark results in the past, so treat these as for information only. But there’s no question the phone is fast enough for you, old man.The camera sensors on the back of the OnePlus 6T are the same as those fitted to the OnePlus 6. There are two: A 16-megapixel camera with an f/1.7 aperture and optical image stabilization, and a second 20-megapixel lens with the same aperture. Both work together to create bokeh-style pictures, without cropping the image. OnePlus has improved the software driving the cameras, saying they provide better face identification, less noise, and greater edge detection.We’ve only had a few days with the camera at the time of writing, but so far we’re impressed with its ability. Taking outdoor photos on an overcast day, the HDR mode kicked in to reveal some very atmospheric clouds, while maintaining the autumnal colors on the ground. Indoors, we were surprised at the very effective white balance, and its ability to bring out plenty of detail in low light.However, there’s a new Night mode, and it hasn’t proven to be effective yet. Taking photos of a sunset across the rooftops in both standard and Night mode didn’t reveal many differences. If anything, the Night mode shot had more noise and less detail. OnePlus has not revealed how the Night mode operates yet.Edge detection in portrait mode shots is excellent, thankfully, and the improvements are obvious.Slightly heavier than the OnePlus 6 in the best way possible, but no less comfortable to hold.The camera app isn’t the best we’ve used. The settings are hidden under a slide-up menu, which isn’t that intuitive and mostly just repeats the functions available on the main screen, and when you swap to the front camera, modes like Night mode remain available, yet don’t work with the selfie cam. Accidentally tap one, and the camera reverts back to the rear camera. Annoying.We will be trying out the slow motion video mode, and the 2× zoom feature — both which have been great so far — more, along with taking more photos in more environments, over the next few weeks. So far, the OnePlus 6T seems to have the best camera we’ve seen from the company, but it’s still one of the weakest parts of the phone compared to other flagships.Inside the OnePlus 6T is a 3,700mAh battery, and a clever new component design under the base of the screen. You’ll never see it, but OnePlus has stacked several components in this section to make space for the new in-display fingerprint sensor, and maintained the size of the speaker box, while fitting a cell that’s 400mAh larger than the one in the OnePlus 6. We’ll take this new tech, and the larger battery, over the headphone jack.The battery has fast charging using the proprietary Dash Charge cable and plug, but still no wireless charging. We have not spent enough time with the OnePlus 6T yet to establish battery life, but have so far seen great performance, with a single charge powering through to a day-and-a-half.The phone’s pricing is as follows:Things are changing for OnePlus. What was once an online-only purchasing endeavor is now considerably more a hands-on buying experience, in both the U.S. and the U.K. For the first time, you can now go into a T-Mobile store and try, then buy, the OnePlus 6T for yourself.Additionally, the OnePlus 6T works on the Verizon network, if you buy the phone without a connection through OnePlus. In the U.K. the OnePlus 6T is available through the O2 network, as before, but also now through EE and Vodafone stores too.OnePlus continues to refine its formula for the perfect smartphone, and the OnePlus 6T is the closest it has gotten to it yet. The downsides are few, and often only niggles, leaving a reasonably priced phone that has something for everyone.The 6GB/128GB version for $500 is arguably the only version you really need; paying out for more storage space will add to the longevity, but we’d be surprised if adding 2GB of RAM will make a meaningful difference to performance. It certainly hasn’t in the past. Paying $620 for the 8GB/256GB model will see it potentially “last longer,” but once you start spending this much money, you’re getting closer to other high performance options.OnePlus has recently launched the OnePlus 7 Pro for $670. It’s a better phone than the OnePlus 6T, but the price increase is nothing to laugh at.There’s also two newer phones you should know about; the ZTE Axom Pro and Asus ZenPhone 6. Both have the newer Snapdragon 855 processor but sell in the same price range as the OnePlus 6T.Let’s talk about durability first. It’s a glass phone, so it’s going to break if you drop it. We’d recommend putting it in a case. Like the OnePlus 6, the 6T does not have an IP rating to indicate water and dust resistance. But OnePlus says the phone will be fine in normal conditions, like using it in the rain or a steamy bathroom. There are special silicone rings inside the device, sealed ports, and a sealed up screen. OnePlus’ argument is that IP ratings are difficult to figure out due to the complexity of protection levels, and by saying the 6T will be work in normal damp conditions, it’s being more honest about what to expect. Don’t submerge it, or drop it in water.While we agree that IP ratings can be confusing, and sometimes give people a false sense of security, it helps for comparison, and if you do enough research into them, they bring more clarity regarding protection. Even if OnePlus doesn’t consider IP ratings consumer-friendly, it’d be interesting to see where the OnePlus 6T fits on the scale, with its current level of water and dust resistance.Our review phone has Android 9.0, the latest version of Google’s operating system, and OnePlus is good at releasing updates, at least compared to many of its competitors. Despite OnePlus releasing a phone every six months or so, the 6T will easily last you for more than two years before it will require updating.Yes. The OnePlus 6T is a solid mid-range pick, and doubly so now that it sells for just $500."
106,Oppo Find X,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/oppo-find-x-review/,"The Oppo Find X is arguably the best-looking smartphone we’ve ever seen, and it manages to pack in excellent tech and an ultra cool headline feature. But it comes from a manufacturer relatively unknown outside of China and several other markets in Asia.The astounding design is enough to turn heads, and the tech is genuinely impressive, but is it a phone you should buy? Or should you stick with the relative safety offered by Samsung, Apple, LG, and others available in a retail store near you? We’ve been using the Oppo Find X for quite some time to find out.The Oppo Find X is beyond jaw-droppingly attractive, and it’s so wonderfully free from fuss. There are no camera lenses visible, no easily-spotted speaker grill, no fingerprint sensor, and no garish flourishes a drunk designer decided to add for effect. It’s so smooth, if it were a singer, it’d be Frank Sinatra.It’s also cunningly designed — the dramatically curved edges and superb balance aren’t an accident — to hide its substantial 9.4mm thickness and 186 gram weight. You won’t believe either figure when you hold the phone. Gorilla Glass 5 is used on the front and back, with aluminum for the phone’s frame. If style is everything, the Oppo Find X would be number one, two, and three on the recommendation list of “phones to buy.”It’s so smooth, if it were a singer, it’d be Frank Sinatra.Much as design is important, it’s not what really matters, which means there’s plenty more to come as we dig deeper. First, there are some concerns over this cutting-edge design, mostly surrounding durability. Popular YouTube tech tester JerryRigEverything showed his Oppo Find X wasn’t built to withstand a bend test, cracking the phone quickly in a tortuous video clip.We’ve not subjected our phone to a similar test — we need it to work in order to review it — but we have noticed the chassis does creak when you try to bend it. Many phones do this, and none are really designed to withstand such harsh treatment. Additionally, there is some flex when you squeeze or press the screen and glass rear panel with some force. A screen protector comes fitted as standard, but its quality isn’t very high as it scratches easily.The smoothness of the phone also makes it slippery. Not in the hand, where it actually has a great grip and feel, but on most flat surfaces. On glass and smooth wood desks, the phone moves around on its own, threatening to fall on the floor several times without any warning. It was so common, we’d lodge it behind other items so it couldn’t escape. The Find X is like many beautiful things: Delicate, and in need of much care and attention.The Oppo Find X is the second phone we’ve seen in 2018 with a motorized camera module — following the Vivo Nex S — which is both its headline feature, and further cause for concern over durability. The module elevates out the top of the phone and contains the dual-lens rear camera, the selfie camera, and an infrared sensor for face recognition. Press it down and it retracts into the phone after a little pressure, but the module itself does wobble about, which makes it feel fragile.The module elevates out the top of the phone and contains the dual-lens rear camera.It most likely isn’t, and Oppo said it put the module and its mechanism through lengthy tests to ensure it’s reliable for more than 300,000 uses. In our weeks with the phone, it has not caused any problems, but because this is new territory, we don’t know the warning signs of what makes a good or bad module yet, hence our trepidation. It’s also used a great deal. The face recognition is the phone’s only biometric security system, thus it raises and retracts every time you unlock the phone. Think about how many times that could happen in a day, let alone over two years.You’ll also use the camera a lot, because it’s really good. The rear camera has two lenses: A 16-megapixel f/2.0 lens, and a 20-megapixel f/2.0 secondary lens. Why they have the same aperture is a mystery, and a missed opportunity to improve the camera more. The main lens has optical image stabilization, phase detection autofocus, and a 1.22nm pixel size. Features include a portrait mode, and a slow motion video mode. The selfie camera has 25-megapixels and auto HDR, plus an artificial intelligence-driven beauty mode.The rear camera uses artificial intelligence for scene recognition, and the portrait mode has various custom lighting effects, along with the AI beauty mode too. Google Lens is built in. Oddly, simple features like activating a grid are found not in the camera app, but in the Settings menu for the phone itself. It’s not very intuitive.How fast is the camera, considering the module has to raise up first? There is a shortcut on the phone’s lock screen, and the delay is about half a second before you’re ready to take a photo. It’s barely noticeable, and we’d be surprised if opportunities were lost because of the camera setup. It’s the same for the face unlock. Recognition is almost instant after swiping up on the lock screen. We found it equally as reliable as the iPhone X, with only sunlight in the wrong position causing it to fail.Outside in the daytime, almost regardless of the weather conditions, the Oppo Find X takes glorious, exciting, and emotion-packed photos.It’s not as fast as the fastest fingerprint sensors — the OnePlus sensor, for example — but is comparable to current in-display fingerprint sensors, such as the Vivo Nex S and the Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS. We didn’t find it frustrating, and never wished for an alternative unlock method. Oppo also uses an infrared sensor for the Find X, which is more secure than the sensors used in camera-based face unlock systems, which are usually only secondary convenience features.Outside in the daytime, almost regardless of the weather conditions, the Oppo Find X takes glorious, exciting, and emotion-packed photos. The colors are usually spectacular, with plenty of detail in the darker areas. The Portrait mode’s bokeh effect is effective, picking out edges where other phones sometimes fail, plus we really like the mono-tone light black-and-white effect created too. Scene recognition activates consistently, but there’s no obvious way to turn it off. The AI beauty mode is very strong, altering almost all facial features from eye size and complexion, to slimness and tone.						Try out the slow motion video too, which can be shot in either 720p at 240fps, or at 120fps in 720p. We liked the effect, but it’s shot in a continuous manner, rather than the super slow-mo we’ve seen on the Galaxy S9 Plus and the Huawei P20 Pro. This does take away some of the awkwardness of capturing a slow motion moment, but also reduces the wow factor.The Oppo Find X has a notch-less, almost bezel-free, 6.4-inch AMOLED screen with a 2,340 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It’s hard to fault that spec, and it does look great in most situations, however, it’s not incredibly bright and suffered in sunny conditions outside. Video performance is superb, as you’d expect from a strong AMOLED screen, with everything from YouTube to Netflix looking great.From the curved edges to the lack of interruption, we wish every phone was the visual feast the Oppo Find X is. The screen also holds another secret. It works as a notification light, bringing back an Oppo fan-favourite feature, the Skyline. Here, rather than a long light at the base of the phone, the edges of the display light up according to notifications and status. It’s eye-catching, effective, and unique.On the screen is Oppo’s ColorOS, which is a user interface placed over the top of Android 8.1 Oreo. This is a heavily modified version of Android, with a lot of changes compared to a standard version of Android installed on a Google Pixel or Android One phone. All apps are placed on multiple home screens, Oppo has its own app store and various pre-installed apps including weather and the UC Browser. The Settings menu is different, notifications operate differently (and not very well), and there are various custom features to explore.Oppo also has its own iPhone X-like gesture control system, where swipes from different points on the screen navigate you around the operating system. While it works, it’s not as natural as that found in iOS, and we quickly returned to the normal Android navigation keys which thankfully, still remain the default option.This is a heavily modified version of Android, with a lot of changes compared to a standard version of Android installed on a Google Pixel phone.All these things sound bad, and compared to standard Android, it’s cluttered. But Google Play Services, the Google Play Store, and all the associated Google apps are installed. This makes the Find X feel more familiar than the Vivo Nex S, which doesn’t have any Google apps pre-installed. We like the Game Space that minimizes distractions, optimizes performance, and even cuts out background network connectivity for other apps when playing games.There are also custom gestures that use the screen edge to activate split screen mode, and to switch between running apps. We couldn’t get this to work reliably, but did use the raise-to-wake feature. When watching video, a swipe at the screen edge brings in a menu with a few controls including a screenshot, and a shortcut to block notifications.Color OS is a solid third-party user interface. It’s not slow, which is the main thing, but you’ll need to be prepared to learn new ways of doing things on the Find X. The drastic customization may mean the Oppo Find X doesn’t receive regular operating system updates from Google too.Our review Oppo Find X has a Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space. It’s a top-of-the-range smartphone, with power-a-plenty. We tried some benchmark apps for comparison.The OnePlus 6 and the Galaxy S9 score around the same, while the HTC U12 Plus and the Sony Xperia XZ2 come a little under the Find X’s scores. We did not experience any performance issues, and consider the Oppo Find X to be one of the most capable phones you can buy, provided you can live with a few little compromises.The Oppo Find X can get quite warm. Running these three benchmarks back-to-back saw the phone get hot to the touch, probably more so than we’d be comfortable holding the device for any length of time. Playing Riptide GP2 and Reckless Racing 3 didn’t tax the phone to the same extent, but did prove to be a frustrating experience due to the active speaker on the base of the phone being covered by our hand in landscape orientation, resulting in muffled sound.Screen layout is also compromised. In full-screen mode, buttons are often placed too close to the edge of the screen making them hard to press mid-game. Switching to regular view isn’t any better, as the game view gets squashed up to the left edge of the screen anyway, creating the same problem. Also, instead of a plain black bar, the tap-to-enter-fullscreen-mode reminder is permanently displayed, making it look ugly.A 3,730mAh battery is inside the Oppo Find X, complete with Oppo’s VOOC fast charging. We would regularly get a day’s worth of use out of the battery, but gaming does tend to pull plenty of power, and heavy users may need to grab the VOOC charger before the end of a long day. Charging the Find X’s battery for 30 minutes using the VOOC charger saw it reach 60 percent capacity, and after an hour it was at 80 percent, and all finished within 75 minutes. Superb performance. There’s no wireless charging, despite the glass body, and it does not feature the even faster Super VOOC system, which is reserved for special edition versions of the phone.The Oppo Find X is currently only available as an import, not through retail or official online stores in the U.S. or the U.K.. Oppo says this will change in the future, and has said it will be sold in North America and Europe in the future. No dates have been provided at the time of publication.Do you want to turn heads with the coolest-looking smartphone out there?The official price is 1,000 euros, or 1,000 British pounds, which converts over to around $1,150. Prices vary online if you’re willing to import, and the Find X can be found for less. However, this means you will have to deal with whatever warranty your importer provides.Even with all the goodwill earned with the design and specification, the Find X is a very expensive phone at full price, almost equalling the highest-spec Apple iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 9.Utterly delectable in shape, form, and function, the Oppo Find X has almost everything we want from a smartphone. What’s missing is confidence in its ability to withstand anything other than the best treatment, and in the manner with which we must purchase it.This is a difficult question. Yes, there are many better alternatives, but none of them will replicate the joy of seeing, holding, and using the Oppo Find X. It is, unusually today in the smartphone world, almost unique. The closest you’ll get is the Vivo Nex S, which has the same issues surrounding how to buy it, and future warranty support. The Oppo Find X’s software is considerably better than Vivo’s Funtouch OS though.Forego the motorized camera and baby-skin smooth body to focus on the specification, and everything from the $530 OnePlus 6 to the $840 Galaxy S9 Plus comes into range. We are fans of both. The Google Pixel 2 XL is also recommended, although at this stage, we’d say wait a while to see what the Pixel 3 range provides before buying one.The big advantage with buying any of these is the ease with which one can do so, because you don’t have to worry about importers, and a solid warranty backing up your purchase.The Oppo Find X is not water resistant, it’s made of glass, and feels relatively delicate. If you’re not careful with the phone, it may not last long at all. Internally, the phone has all the speed and technology to last for several years, and as the design looks futuristic now, and is unlikely to age badly.Software updates are difficult to estimate, due to our inexperience with long-term Oppo phone use. However, we can be sure Android version updates will be slower than buying a Google Pixel phone, due to the ColorOS user interface. We do not know when Android 9.0 Pie will arrive.Is money no object? Do you want to turn heads with the coolest-looking smartphone out there? If the answer is yes, then buy the Oppo Find X right now. It’s a truly wonderful thing. However, if you are shopping for your sole device that you’re planning to use everyday, all-day, then the Find X will be a gamble. You’re definitely better off buying a phone locally rather than importing a delicate flower like the Find X."
107,Pixel 3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/google-pixel-3-review/,"Editor’s note: The Google Pixel 4 is now available. It’s the better pick if choosing between these two phones. Read our full Google Pixel 4 review.Google’s Pixel 3 came near the end of a year that was packed with some of the best smartphones. There was a general air of skepticism ahead of the release. The widely leaked design looked dated next to the iPhone XS, the spec sheet appeared lacking next to the Galaxy Note 9, and the single lens camera seemed limited next to the P20 Pro, but the Pixel 3 proved that there are still some things Apple, Samsung, and Huawei could learn from Google’s unique approach to the smartphone market.Along with the new year, and a fresh wave of smartphones has washed ashore ready to push the Pixel for the best Android phone title. Starting at $799, the Pixel 3 is $150 more expensive than its predecessor, making its sibling, which starts at $899, less of a leap. You can read our Pixel 3 XL review to find out what we think of the bigger Google phone, but before you decide to go large, allow us to explain what makes the Pixel 3 so compelling.Design is important, and yet it sometimes feels like Google’s approach to hardware is a little too laidback. The Pixel 3 XL’s ugly, deep notch and the big bezels that flank the Pixel 3’s screen have been roundly derided. Google is behind the curve here. If you’re going to have a notch, there shouldn’t be such a thick bezel at the bottom; if you shrink bezels down, you can fit larger screens in without making handsets too big. If it’s a choice between notch and bezels, we prefer the bezels of the Pixel 3.All the prejudgment of the Pixel 3 was based on its looks, but our opinion immediately softened when we held one in our hand. This cannot be properly conveyed through words or photos alone, so we strongly suggest you try to lay hands on one yourself. The Pixel 3 is the perfect size and weight for a smartphone. Of all the phones we’ve used over the last year, the Pixel 3 is the easiest to use one-handed and the most comfortable to handle.It’s gently curved with a glossy frame sandwiched by glass. Google’s signature two-tone design has been retained on the back, with a small glossy section at the top which houses the camera module, and a matte section for the bottom 80 percent which has the centrally-placed fingerprint sensor near the top.The clever part here is the back of the Pixel 3 is in fact one continuous piece of tough Gorilla Glass 5. The etched finish is a special technique we haven’t seen before. It feels soft to the touch and it doesn’t pick up any visible finger smudges or prints which are such a common blight on glass smartphones.You’ll find the power button on the right edge with the volume rocker below. On our white review unit, the power button is mint green, but there’s a black version with a black power button, and a pink version with an orange power button. Apart from that there’s just the USB-C port on the bottom edge with the SIM card tray next to it. No room for a MicroSD card here and no 3.5mm audio jack.The Pixel 3 is the perfect size and weight for a smartphone.The Pixel 3 is a very similar size to the iPhone XS, measuring in a touch taller, but not quite as wide. While Apple has packed a 5.8-inch display into its handset, the Pixel 3’s display is 5.5 inches. The dual lens front-facing camera is embedded in the left side of the top bezel and there are central stereo speakers top and bottom. The speakers are 40 percent louder than the Pixel 2, and they sound much more dynamic, and the sound can easily fill a room.All the leading phone manufacturers have switched to OLED screens in their flagships now and we’re glad they have. The higher contrast ratio really tells, especially in low light and dark conditions where true black stands out and backlights cause problems.With a 2,260 x 1,080-pixel resolution, the Pixel 3 display is sharp and legible. Google has made some serious effort here to improve on the displays in last year’s Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, after the latter came in for some serious flack. We’re pleased to report that this year’s phones are pixel perfect.Placing the Pixel 3 side-by-side with the iPhone XS, it’s impossible to choose between them. The Pixel 3 screen is excellent. Google has upped the saturation after complaints about the more natural display tuning in last year’s phones, and we think it looks much better. It’s also worth noting that you can still dip into the display settings and switch back to the more “natural” color profile.Gaming in the dark, watching a movie on the train, or reading on a park bench – whatever you’re doing the display looks great and it adjusts automatically to suit the environment.What excites us most about the Pixel 3 is the groundbreaking artificial intelligence (A.I.) inside. The Pixel 3 can do things no other phone can. A lot of these A.I. smarts reside in the camera, which we’ll get to soon, but Google Assistant is growing more useful by the day and there are other genuinely helpful features in here that add up to a great experience.The scourge of spam calls may have you dreading your ringtone, so Google’s Call Screening feature will be welcome. It allows you to use Google Assistant to answer a call for you, and then you will see a live transcription of what the caller is saying. Within the first five seconds, it’s easy to tell whether it’s a genuine person trying to reach you or a robocall. You can mark it as spam if it is the latter. You can even use this feature if you’re in a meeting or busy as a way to see why someone is calling, though it might feel a little strange for the person on the other line. Either way, this has quickly become one of our favorite features on the Pixel 3. It has also rolled out to the Pixel 2 and 2 XL.The Pixel 3 isn’t likely to excite you at first glance, but it’s a smartphone with hidden depths.We tried out Google’s Duplex feature, which allows you to ask Google Assistant to book a table for you or set up an appointment. It’s available on the Pixel 3 in more than 40 states now and it’s set to roll out to any device running Android 5.0 or up very soon. You’ll even be able to use it on the iPhone if you have Google Assistant installed. Sadly, there’s no news on international availability yet.The clever Now Playing feature, which identifies the music that’s playing wherever you go on the lock screen, has been improved with a history page that allows you to review the track list. That means you can go back and find out what that tune from last night’s party that’s now stuck in your head was.If you plug in the wired, USB-C earbuds that come with your Pixel 3, then Google Assistant will pop up and tell you when you have a text message, giving you the option to hear it. You can also ask any of the usual array of questions to find out about the next train, your schedule, the weather, or listen to another track.Speaking of music, you get six months of YouTube Music for free with the Pixel 3, after which it costs $10 per month.On paper, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and 4GB of RAM appear distinctly average, but we haven’t encountered any issues with performance in the Pixel 3. This is a slick, responsive smartphone that happily fires up and runs whatever apps or games you choose.While the Snapdragon 845 is ubiquitous, many other top smartphones have 6GB or 8GB of RAM, including the relatively cheap OnePlus 6 and the Asus Zenfone 5Z. We can understand why people might have expected Google to pack in more RAM, but we’re confident the vast majority of people are going to be happy with the speed of the Pixel 3.The benchmark results are exactly what you might expect:That puts the Pixel 3 at the same level as most other 2018 Android flagships, including the Note 9. We don’t think you’ll see a discernible difference, and the fact that the Pixel 3 is unencumbered by a manufacturer UI, like Samsung’s Experience, means that it feels faster and slicker.You won’t be surprised to find the latest version of Google’s mobile operating system on the Pixel 3. Android 9 Pie offers lots of little improvements, from more expansive notifications to digital wellbeing checks designed to help you keep your phone use under control. It may take a little period of adjustment to get used to the lack of classic navigation buttons and pick up the new gestures, but anyone switching from another Android device is going to feel at home here.Check out our Android 9.0 Pie review for a deeper dive into what it has to offer.As the developer of Android, Google will push security updates and larger feature updates out to the Pixel range first. That means software update speeds on a par with Apple, negating one of the big criticisms of the Android ecosystem: Security and fragmentation. The Pixel 3 is guaranteed to get software updates for at least two years, and security updates for three, which is more than we can say for many other Android flagships.Our reigning camera phone champion was the Pixel 2, but Google has improved on the Pixel 2 and 2 XL cameras in the Pixel 3 and 3 XL. Once again, both sizes of phone have an identical camera setup.We’re very happy with the camera so far, in fact it’s our pick for best of the year.The main camera boasts a single lens rated at 12.2 megapixels with an f/1.8 aperture. The front-facing camera now consists of two 8-megapixel lenses, one with an f/1.8 aperture and a wide-angle companion with an f/2.2 aperture.But you must look beyond the hardware to find the exciting changes. Google employs machine learning and A.I. to enhance your photography in a number of clever ways. The HDR+ function, introduced in the Pixel 2, stitches together different exposures to arrive at the ideal shot. It makes a return here, but Google has added some extra features in the shape of Top Shot, Super Res Zoom, and Night Sight.Top Shot captures frames before and after you press that shutter button and then identifies and discards the blurry shots or the shots where people looked away or blinked. You can tap to expand the menu and review the shots yourself, but we’ve yet to find a better shot than the one suggested. The image quality does take a hit here for photos that aren’t the original, however.Super Res Zoom is designed to wring greater detail out of photos where you’ve zoomed in. Digital zooms generally result in very noisy shots, but Super Res Zoom helps to reduce the noise and get results that are closer to those you’d expect from a dedicated telephoto lens capable of optical zoom, like the ones you’ll find in the iPhone XS and the Galaxy S9 Plus. It’s good, but it doesn’t quite match up. Zoom in further, and the Pixel 3 generally has the most detail.Night Sight is an evolution of the HDR+ approach that stitches together even more shots to improve the already decent low light performance, combining frames to improve colors and pick out details that would usually be lost. It’s available as an update to the Google Camera app and it makes a big difference, and works with both the front-facing and main cameras.Cameras have come far in the last couple of years and picking the best is very subjective, but the Pixel 3 gets our vote. We have several in-depth camera comparisons, but these shots, taken with the Pixel 3 and the iPhone XS, show the difference in approach taken by Google and Apple.While we see a similar quality and high level of detail in all these shots, there are striking divergences. The Edinburgh Castle photo was taken on typically rainy, misty day and the Pixel 3 is much closer to how the scene looked in real life, but the bluish tinge introduced by the iPhone XS arguably makes the scene more attractive.For the indoor shot in a bar, the Pixel 3 photo is much brighter and clearer, but veers dangerously towards overexposure in a couple of areas. The iPhone XS shot is softer, but not quite as sharp.One of the main strengths of the Pixel 3 cameras, both front and back, is the portrait mode. The results in different environments with different light levels are never less than excellent.The Pixel 3 takes portrait photos that you want to share, and most people are surprised and delighted by the results, though it isn’t perfect. If you look very closely at the edges of the subject, you’ll sometimes see areas where the blur should have been applied but hasn’t been.The front-facing camera is also capable of portrait shots, applying that bokeh blur after the fact every bit as successfully as the main camera. Each portrait shot is presented as two photos: The original, without the blur, and the second with the blur applied.One of the biggest upgrades in the Pixel 3 is the introduction of a second wide-angle lens, triggered with an easy to reach slider in the camera app next to the shutter button. You can see that group selfies or selfies where you want to fit in some background are much easier to capture with the wide-angle option.Pleasingly, unlike some other wide-angle options we’ve used, there isn’t a lot of noticeable distortion in the corners or noise creeping in with the Pixel 3. It’s a well-thought out feature that’s easy to use and it works nicely.We’re very happy with the camera so far, in fact it’s our pick for best of the year, though it does have some seriously stiff competition. Read our complete guide to Pixel 3 photography for even more info.Before we move on, it’s also important to note that you get free, unlimited cloud storage for all the photos and videos you take with your Pixel 3 in their original, top quality resolution with Google Photos. That’s a valuable perk.If you’ve been reading along with a smile, accelerating towards putting in an order for a Pixel 3 at the end of this review, then this is the point where we slam the brakes on. Sit down, take a breath, we have some bad news: This smartphone lacks stamina.The Pixel 3 has a 2,915mAh battery. We were disappointed with the battery life in the Pixel 2, but hoped that the slight jump in capacity from 2,700mAh, coupled with a more efficient processor and software, might result in a decent jump in stamina. Sadly, that hasn’t been the case and the Pixel 3 is giving us battery anxiety a little too frequently.On a busy day you’re going to be searching for an outlet long before bedtime. After a fairly busy day of mixed use, with plenty of photo shooting, starting at 8 a.m. we managed to crawl to 11 p.m. but the Pixel 3’s battery percentage was into single figures when we plugged in. Our companion, using the iPhone XS and taking all the same photos, still had 38 percent in the tank.On a busy day you’re going to be searching for an outlet long before bedtime.Much depends on how you use your phone, but we often found the Pixel 3 was low enough by early evening that we’d plug in for a quick charge if we had plans to go out.The good news is that Google includes proper, USB-PD, fast charging kit in the box, providing an 18W wall charger and a USB-C to USB-C charging cable, unlike some other manufacturers. That means you can go from 17 percent to 42 percent in 15 minutes and it took just 50 minutes to hit 100 percent.There’s also Qi wireless charging at fast, 10W speeds with any wireless charging pad or stand that supports it. Google is selling its own Pixel Stand wireless charger that it says will charge the phone the fastest, but it does so much more than just charge.A few months in, battery life is still the main problem we have with the Pixel 3.The Pixel 3 is currently available for sale, and costs $799 for the 64GB model or $899 for the 128GB model. It is a Verizon exclusive in the U.S., but you can buy it unlocked from Google and use it with any major carrier. You can find out all the details in our Pixel 3 buying guide.It has a standard one-year warranty in the U.S. and a two-year warranty in Europe. If you’re unlucky enough to encounter a manufacturing defect, your Pixel 3 will be repaired or replaced free of charge.The Pixel 3 isn’t likely to excite you at first glance, but it’s a smartphone with hidden depths. Google offers the best Android experience hands-down, unique A.I. features that are unmatched elsewhere, and a camera that captures wonderful photos. The trade-off is dull design, though it feels a lot better than it looks, and a worrying lack of stamina.If your main concern is the product’s cost, you can also check out our picks for the best Google Pixel deals and smartphone deals that include other brands.Yes.We are impressed with Samsung’s Galaxy S10 range, particularly the Galaxy S10 Plus, which has a gorgeous design, a spectacular screen, and an upgrade to 2019’s flagship processor — the Snapdragon 855. But it is more expensive. You can check out our comparison of the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Google Pixel 3 to compare the specs yourself.If you like the sound of the Pixel 3, but want a larger screen, then the Pixel 3 XL offers much the same in a bigger, uglier package. Another, more recent option is the OnePlus 7 Pro, which delivers excellent hardware at a reasonable price.You might also consider the iPhone 11, Apple’s competitor. It has a better camera and excellent performance.Of course, the Google Pixel 4 is now available. It’s an upgrade overall, and the better pick if you a current flagship Android phone.We think the Pixel 3 will last you three years if you look after it. Google has guaranteed timely software updates for at least that long. You should get a case to protect the glass, but the phone is IP68 water resistant, so you have some water protection.Yes. If you want the best Android experience and you prefer something you can use one-handed, the Pixel 3 is tailored for you."
108,Red Hydrogen One,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/red-hydrogen-one-review/,"Red says the Hydrogen One is a phone the world “can’t stop looking at.” Yet we’re ready to put it down.Perhaps the hype inflated our expectations, but we’re disappointed by the “better than 3D” display the company touted for a better part of the year. The technology is impressive, there’s no doubt about that, but the result feels jarring. Worse, many of the phone’s core features won’t be available until the end of 2019. While it’s undeniably the most interesting phone we’ve reviewed this year, it’s also among the least practical.Editor’s note: We’ve updated this review after we received an over-the-air update.No other phone looks like the Hydrogen One. Its unique and loud design often draws curious eyes. The back packs a massive dual-camera module at the top, with raised lines that lead into a flashy red logo, with gold pogo pins below. Kevlar panels lie here with a weave pattern for added protection and flair. Minimal it’s not, but it does resemble Red’s camera gear.The edges of the phone are ridged for better grip. They don’t look pretty, but they do make this behemoth of a phone easier to hold. We like the lined texture, too, as it also helps with grip.There’s a camera shutter button on the right edge towards the bottom, an indented fingerprint sensor on the same side (which doubles as the power button), a USB-C charging port at the bottom, and a headphone jack at the top. The fingerprint sensor is quick to react and unlocks the phone quickly.On the front, you’ll see an aesthetic similar to the Razer Phone 2. Chunky bezels at the top and bottom deliver A3D Spatial Surround Audio, which we’ll get into later. The top bezel also houses two cameras, with a LED light that flashes when notifications come through.No other phone looks like the Hydrogen One.There’s a little too much going on all around, and even people with large hands will find it cumbersome to use. We constantly had to shuffle it up and down just to be able to reach the top or bottom of the screen, and it’s heavy at 263 grams. Apple’s 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max weighs just 208 grams, while the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 weighs 201 grams.The build quality, however, is excellent, as the phone feels like it can withstand its fair share of drops. The model we reviewed is made of aluminum, but a titanium version is also available (at $1,595) for an even heftier, more luxurious feel.There’s a reason for the ridged lines and pogo pins on the back of the phone — the Red Hydrogen One is a modular phone. It’s not magnetic like Motorola’s Moto Mods, but mods will attach to the back of the phone in some way.We say “will” because it’s currently a promised, not delivered, feature. Red hasn’t shown any finalized mods yet, but we know of three planned so far: A battery mod, an expandable storage mod, and a Cinema mod. The latter is the most interesting, as the company says it will have a Red imaging sensor, and you will be able to attach lenses from Nikon, Sony, Canon, Fujifilm, and a variety of other camera-makers to turn the phone into a proper DSLR.That sounds incredible. Just one problem. The earliest we expect to see the mod is a full year after the Hydrogen One’s release, in the fall of 2019. It also sounds like it’ll cost a pretty penny, on top of an already expensive phone. While we’re excited to see how it works, the long wait and high price are a serious issue. Most manufacturers will release an entirely new flagship smartphone by then, putting the Red Hydrogen One well behind the curve before you ever lay hands on the promised Cinema mod.Two features excited us most when we received the Hydrogen One — the Cinema mod and the 4-View display. We won’t be able to test the former until the end of 2019, but the 4-View technology is built into the screen of the phone and available immediately.4-view means the screen can display supported content in 3D, or as Red says, “better than 3D.” Red hasn’t allowed anyone to take a photograph or video of the screen all year because the company believes it’s something you need to see in person to understand. We agree. It’s difficult to describe the effect, and each person we’ve shown has had a visceral reaction. You should visit an AT&T or Verizon store showing off the Hydrogen One and look yourself, because it’s impossible to properly show in video or photographs.At the end of the day, you’ll need a supported screen to see content in 4-View.The Lightfield Display powering the technology is made in partnership with Leia Inc., and it doesn’t require glasses. 4-View’s 3D is much more convincing than Amazon’s Fire Phone, and slightly better than the Nintendo 3DS. Images don’t “pop out” of the screen like a hologram, but you can clearly see depth, which helps makes the subject of an image or video stand out. The effect isn’t perfect, though. It can look fuzzy, doesn’t look great at angles, and we often found ourselves with a minor headache after staring into the 4-View screen for more than few minutes.What can you watch in 4-View? If you take 4-View photos and video in the camera app, you can look at them in the Red Player app. Red also created an app called Holopix, which is a bare bones Instagram-like app that (strangely) isn’t pre-installed. You’re able to share 4-View photos and videos there, but they can only be viewed on the Hydrogen One phone. The company said it’s in talks with Facebook and Instagram to support the 4-View file format, but at the end of the day, you’ll need a supported screen to see content in 4-View.The Red Leia Loft app is a curated store that houses apps and games that support 4-View technology. There’s not a lot of content yet, with only a handful of games available. We played games like Flippy Knife in 4-View, and we hardly felt like the effect was being used. It didn’t add anything to the game or the experience.There’s also the Hydrogen Network, which is basically Netflix for 4-View content. You’ll can stream movies and shows with the 3D effect on the phone. Warner Brothers Studios has released several films on this network in 4-View format, like Ready Player One and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (these two films will be free for the first 10,000 people who buy the phone from AT&T). There’s a decent selection of films at the moment, but content is still very thin. The 4-View effect looks surprisingly solid here, but it can still feel a little disorienting at times, and we still would prefer to watch the movie in 2D.The technology that makes 4-View possible is impressive, but it doesn’t feel like more than a gimmick. Some photos and videos (that we captured) looked great, but we weren’t awestruck by the screen. After months of waiting for the reveal, we were a little disappointed when we laid eyes on the Hydrogen One’s screen for the first time. It made us do a double-take because of its novelty, yes, but it wasn’t as revolutionary as was implied. It’s jarring, and we can’t imagine watching anything more than a minute or two long before putting the phone down.Beyond 4-View, it’s a typical 5.7-inch display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,440. It looks good in day-to-day use. It’s sharp, delivers strong colors, and we had no issues viewing the display outside in broad daylight, but it’s not going to beat an iPhone XS, Samsung Galaxy S9, or other flagship phones from major brands. It doesn’t get as bright as we’d like.Sound is provided by stereo speakers that include A3D+ Sound from Red. The company says it’s an algorithm that “frees the stereo files,” making them sound “spatial, immersive,” with or without headphones. We thought audio had solid volume with good highs — and it does provide a spatial 3D sound that travels from one speaker to the other — but it also sounds muffled. We compared it with the Razer Phone 2, and much preferred the latter.The Red Hydrogen One is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 chipset — a processor from 2017. Most 2018 flagship smartphones use the Snapdragon 845 chipset, but Red says the 845 wasn’t ready before the company had to finalize its hardware. There’s 6GB of RAM, as well.Don’t expect this phone to speed through every task.We initially ran into some problems with performance, as we encountered an overall sluggishness operating the user interface and some stuttering. A recent update has fixed many of these problems, and performance is a little better. Apps open relatively quickly, and moving throughout the Android OS is fluid, but it’s definitely noticeably slower than phones with the Snapdragon 845 processor.Here are our benchmark results:These scores put the Red Hydrogen One in line with 2017 phones that had the same processor. You can expect it to handle almost every task, but you may notice a few stutters or lag here and there.Considering this phone is sold by AT&T, expect a lot of carrier bloatware, most of which can be removed. Otherwise, the phone runs a relatively stock version of Android 8.1 Oreo. There’s no word on Android 9 Pie yet. There’s a bit of customization available that’s quite similar to what you’ll find in third-party app Nova Launcher.There’s 128GB of internal storage, as well as a MicroSD card slot, in case you want to add more space. The titanium model comes with 256GB of storage.The Hydrogen One has four cameras in total, two on the front, and two on the back. You can take 4-View photos and videos with both the front and back cameras. There’s a button in the camera app that lets you go into “4V” mode to capture them, or you can stick to 2D. Unfortunately, there’s nowhere to share these pictures except for the Holopix app which, as mentioned, only works with this phone. We can’t show these photos to you, and you would need a screen that supports this technology off to see it anyway. If you send a 4-View photo through some other medium, they will receive the 2D version of it.4-View photography is best with an isolated subject or object, as it helps make the image pop a lot more. The photos can look pixelated, as if you’re looking at them through a virtual reality headset. They’re fun to capture and share when you’re with a group of people that can see the results at the same time, but it’s not a feature we were inspired to use every day. We’d rather take great 2D photos. One downside with 4-View is the images tend to look not as good when they are converted to 2D.The 2D photos captured by this phone are good, but nothing special. There’s solid HDR (when it decides to kick in), and photos can look detailed with good colors. Low-light photos can be blurry and grainy, though if you’re perfectly still you might snag a shot that looks good.We’re not fans of the Portrait Mode with the rear cameras, as the images looked washed out and lacking in detail. However, the front-facing cameras took great Portrait Mode photos in good lighting; in low light, a lot of grain ruins an otherwise good picture.  A Pro Mode is available, but it’s basic. Red said a more robust version is in the works.In the end, the camera isn’t a strong point. It usually takes solid photos and works quickly, but we expected more from a camera company. It’s simply a standard smartphone image sensor inside, not a Red imaging sensor, which is disappointing. It’s not as precise, detailed, or fun as the cameras on the Google Pixel 3, the iPhone XR/XS, and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro.The Hydrogen One’s best feature is its battery life, which comes courtesy of a massive 4,500mAh battery packed inside. With medium to heavy use, including taking pictures and video, playing 4-View games, and streaming music and video, we frequently ended the work day with a little under 50 percent left by 6 p.m.You don’t need to worry about battery life on this phone — it can easily go two days.With light usage, we managed to end a day with around 70 percent left by 5 p.m. You don’t need to worry about battery life on this phone — it can easily go two days. Most flagship smartphones last one day at most, so Red is the clear winner here.The Red Hydrogen One starts at $1,295 for the aluminum model, and $1,595 for the titanium. It’s now available from AT&T for $43.17 a month for 30 months on AT&T Next. It is also available through Verizon for $53.95 a month for 24 months.Red offers a standard one-year limited warranty that covers manufacturer defects.The Red Hydrogen One is the most interesting phone of the year, but also the most disappointing. Red CEO Jim Jannard said people will want to buy the phone when they see the screen. We must disagree. This is clearly the first effort of a company that lacks smartphone experience. We’re excited to see how Red progresses, however, and can’t wait to take a look at the Cinema Mod when it arrives next year.Yes, plenty. If you’re looking for an excellent all-around phone, the iPhone XS is an easy choice. It’s our top pick and it will still be less expensive than the Hydrogen One. The Pixel 3 is our Android favorite, and it has one of the best cameras around. Check our best smartphones guide for more.This phone should last you three years. It’s running a year-old processor already, and it’s on last year’s Android software. We’re not sure when or if it will be updated to Android 9 Pie. The body of the phone will likely be able to survive a drop, which is good, because you won’t want to add a case to this massive, thick phone. There’s no water resistance, however, so be careful near the pool.No. There’s a lot you need to wait for, such as the Cinema Mod coming next year, which may elevate the Hydrogen One and make it truly special. Until then, this is an interesting phone that’s worth keeping an eye on, but not buying."
109,Redmi Note 5,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-redmi-note-10s-review/,"The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S is a good smartphone, but it’s also evidence of just how important it is to consider longevity when deciding which model to buy, regardless of the price. Although it’s a strong value when discounted, as it is when this review was written, at full price you can get a better, longer-lasting 5G phone for not much more money.5G may not be for you today, but it may be tomorrow, and you’d have to upgrade from the Redmi Note 10S to get it. I’ve spent some quality time with the phone to discover if it’s worth taking the risk.The Redmi Note 10S has a plastic frame and a plastic rear panel, with Gorilla Glass over the screen, plus an IP53 splash and dust resistance rating. The 6.43-inch AMOLED screen is flat while the rear is slightly curved, and the whole thing weighs 178 grams and is 8.3mm thick. There’s a fingerprint scanner in the power key on the side of the phone, a 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom, and four cameras in the module on the back.It’s not a remarkable-looking smartphone, but it’s far from unattractive with a few standout design touches I really like, such as the use of clear plastic for the camera module which makes it appear slimmer. The plastic body provides grip and adds lightness, plus it’s comfortable to hold for extended periods of time, but it does get covered in messy fingerprints — on the front and the back — and the back panel has some unpleasant flex to it when pressed.This is why the Redmi Note 10S is so price-sensitive. It’s obviously not a premium smartphone, but it edges awfully close to being a little too cheap. No one really wants to pay much for a phone that sounds hollow when tapped, and the Redmi Note 10S does. It is a low-cost smartphone built on a budget, but this won’t matter too much if you can secure one for a low price.The main camera has 64-megapixels and an f/1.8 aperture, plus Phase Detection Autofocus, and it’s alongside an 8MP, f/2.2 wide-angle camera, plus a 2MP depth and 2MP macro camera. It’s not bad. In good outdoor conditions, it takes well-balanced photos with a lovely splash of color, provided you’re careful with the “AI” mode. Sometimes it can really enhance a picture, but in other situations it can heavy-handedly up the color, boost the contrast, and process the image to where it doesn’t look natural. It’s a gamble which one you get, unfortunately.In more difficult lighting the camera’s white balance suffers, and stormy clouds turn more blue than grey or black. Outdoor shots also lose some visual excitement and detail when the ambient light is low. The Portrait mode is effective and edge recognition is good. The selfie camera has a degree of beautification active by default, so it lightens and smooths your skin, but it can be deactivated easily.If you can get the Redmi Note 10S at the right price the camera won’t disappoint, but spend just a little more and you can get phones with much better cameras.Xiaomi chose MediaTek as its partner on the Redmi Note 10S, but it didn’t opt for a Dimensity chip to add 5G. Instead, the phone uses a MediaTek Helio G95 octa-core chip with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM. My review model has 6GB of RAM. Using the phone for general purposes, like Twitter and Instagram, web browsing, some YouTube, and casual games it’s fine and doesn’t get hot or suffer from slowdown.I have played a lot of Asphalt 9: Legends during my time with the phone. I didn’t alter the default graphics settings and saw only the very occasional pause during the action. It never became bothersome, and the phone never became too hot. It’s a great little phone for casual gaming.It’s a great little phone for casual gamingI like the 2400 x 1080 AMOLED screen and the video experience too. It’s bright enough that I haven’t had issues seeing it outside in sunlight, although I do miss a high refresh rate. There are stereo speakers on the phone too, making watching video way more fun than you often find on phones at this price, but they don’t provide much bass.There’s no 5G onboard, which does affect the longevity of the phone as while you may not want the fast data connection now, you may next year. It does have NFC for Google Pay and dual-SIM support, plus a microSD card slot too. I also like the fingerprint sensor, which is well placed in the power key and quick to respond.The phone has Android 11 with Xiaomi’s MIUI 12.5.2 interface over the top. It comes with Google Play and all the usual Google services, plus a variety of Xiaomi’s own apps such as a calculator, a QR code scanner, a file manager, and the Mi Store app store. It’s identical in looks to the version on Xiaomi’s more expensive phones like the Mi 11 Ultra, and it runs smoothly and stably here. It’s customizable, the notifications can be interacted with in the notification shade, and I’ve found it to be reliable.There are some annoyances though. The Always-on screen isn’t always on at all, no matter what settings I use, and instead lights up when a notification arrives or with a double-tap of the screen. The Dark Mode is haphazard with app support, resulting in some apps not displaying properly, and I dislike the way it dims the wallpaper by default too, as it makes the phone dull to look at.The Always-on screen isn’t always on at all, no matter what settings I useNone of these things are really unique to the Redmi Note 10S and affect all MIUI phones. Version 12.5 installed on the Redmi Note 10S does seem to have improved energy efficiency though, and many of the pre-installed apps can be either hidden or uninstalled, something not always available in previous versions of MIUI. I never mind using MIUI as I expect these idiosyncrasies, but Xiaomi’s Android software is still less enjoyable to use than Samsung’s One UI and OnePlus’s OxygenOS.Turning the Redmi Note 10S off overnight saw the 5,000mAh battery last for three days with general use, and that includes using the camera, social networking, a video call and a few voice calls, and other basic phone tasks. Use the phone more heavily and it’ll still last two days without a problem. The battery life is a real strong point, but high-intensity tasks can drain it quickly. An hour of YouTube video at high resolution takes at least 15% of the battery life, for example.A 33W fast charger is included in the box, which Xiaomi claims delivers 54% of charge in 30 minutes.The Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S is not officially sold in the U.S. but can be imported. It’s available now through Xiaomi’s official online store in the U.K., where at full price it costs 229 British pounds, which is about $320. However, at the time of writing it’s discounted to 179 pounds, or about $250.If you can get the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S for the lowest price, it’s a good value smartphone for people who won’t be demanding too much of it, or have any expectation to use 5G. It delivers strong performance for your money, with a good screen and long and battery life. The MediaTek Helio G95 processor isn’t the newest, but it’s powerful enough for everyday use and for casual gaming too. Even the camera is acceptable in the right conditions.It delivers strong performance for your money, with a good screen and long and battery lifeHowever, the lack of 5G is a problem. Cheap 5G phones are plentiful today, and they don’t all cost much more than the Redmi Note 10S. You may not be able to get 5G in your area today, but you may next month or next year, and upgrading your phone to get it at that time isn’t necessary if you choose wisely today. If you can afford to get (or have the time to save a little more) a 5G phone now, it will absolutely be worth it in the long run, and that takes the Redmi Note 10S out of the running.Yes. If you’re in the U.S. but don’t want to import the Redmi Note 10S and have about $250 to spend, we recommend the $200 Motorola Moto G Power (2021) if 5G isn’t your thing, or take a look at the $300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G or the $280 Samsung Galaxy A32 5G if it is. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but two have 5G, providing some future-proofing.In the U.K. we’d recommend spending a little more to get the OnePlus Nord CE 5G, which costs 299 pounds. The software is better, it comes with 5G for the future, has IP67 water resistance, and is equal to, or better than, the Redmi Note 10S in most other areas too. Also, take a look at the Realme 8 5G, which also has 5G from MediaTek’s Dimensity 700 chip, and costs 200 pounds.The plastic body and IP53 splash and dust resistance rating should give the Redmi Note 10S a strong chance of surviving some moderately rough treatment. This is a 4G LTE phone and does not come with a 5G modem, which means if you want to try the fast data connection in the future you will have to change your phone.No. You can get a phone with better software, and that will last longer, by spending just a little more money."
110,ROG Phone,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/asus-rog-phone-review/,"Gaming smartphones have become a trend over the past year or so, with Razer, Honor, Xiaomi, and now Asus, all launching devices specifically aimed at mobile gamers. It’s tempting to think of mini game consoles, but they’re actually more like gaming PCs, which will be called upon to do plenty more than simply play games.It’s a tough line to walk. Too much emphasis on gaming, and you get an annoyingly niche product nobody wants. Too little emphasis on gaming, and you don’t stand out from the pack. How about the Asus ROG Phone? Asus makes smartphones, computers, and gaming equipment, so it should be better prepared than any of the competition. Is the ROG Phone the ultimate mobile gaming machine, that also works well as an everyday phone?Before we get into the style, let’s talk about the name. It’s the R, O, G, Phone, which is an acronym for Republic of Gamers, Asus’s dedicated gaming brand. It’s not the Rog Phone, with Rog being short for Roger, which is probably for the best.Now that’s all cleared up, just look at it. The ROG Phone’s design screams “gaming phone,” with its slash cuts, sharp lines, and general disregard for what would be considered modern smartphone design tropes. There’s absolutely no symmetry on the back (Porsche Design must be horrified), the fingerprint sensor’s placement doesn’t make sense, the USB Type-C charging port is offset, and the massive Republic of Gamers logo actually lights up.Subtle it’s not, but it is awesome. The mirror black finish on the Gorilla Glass rear panel looks stunning even covered in fingerprints, the plastic cooling panel has copper-colored grills, and the light-up ROG logo is so cool, we want one on every phone. Around the front there are two speakers bookending the 6-inch AMOLED screen — covered in Gorilla Glass 6 no less — which doesn’t have a notch. This phone attracts admiring glances, looks like no other, and is one you’ll be proud to flash around.Subtle it’s not, but it is awesome.It’s not all positive. It weighs 200 grams, so you really know it’s in your pocket, it slips around even on flat surfaces like it has a mind of its own, and we dislike the rubber cover on the side-mounted USB Type-C and accessory connector. Not only is it easily lost, but it protrudes from the chassis and looks ugly. The lack of distinguishing marks on the front of the phone means you never know if it’s the right way around in your hand until you feel for the fingerprint sensor or activate the display. But it’s comfortable in the hand, feels pleasing from all that weight, and the 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom is a rarity these days.The ROG Phone is unashamedly a Republic of Gamers device. Everything fans of the gaming brand love about other ROG products is reflected in the phone. Luckily, although it’s loud and brash, even those who don’t have an affinity for Asus’ gaming arm will like its modern, over-the-top looks.Mobile games are the reason Asus expects you to buy the phone, so what makes it different to any other flagship phone? Reason number one is the “binned” Snapdragon 845 processor. A binned processor will be a familiar phrase to those who have built hardcore gaming PCs, but it’s unique in the smartphone world. It refers to the phone using a more powerful version of the 845, in this case running at 2.96GHz, rather than a piffling 2.8GHz in most other phones. It’s supported by 8GB of RAM.We’ve played a variety of games on the ROG Phone, from Fortnite to Hitman Sniper, and Reckless Racing 3 to Danmaku Unlimited. While the games don’t instantly appear faster or smoother, the phone didn’t get warm to the touch, and even cranking the graphics right up didn’t see the phone suffer. Everything just seemed effortless, like it could do this all day long, and we think it could.What amazes is the overall slickness. There’s no stutter, no annoying pauses, even mid-game downloads happen swiftly on slightly poor signals. Playing Hitman Sniper to test it all out, resulted in an hour spent on the game, proving it encourages you to play. If anything, the performance improvements were more noticeable elsewhere.Twitter seemed smoother and more responsive, opening apps — when compared alongside other Snapdragon 845 phones — happened fractions faster too. Taken as a whole, this smoothness, responsiveness, and blazing speed makes the ROG Phone a pleasure to use. It’s why the Apple iPhone is so successful, and the Asus ROG Phone comes closer to that experience than any other Android phone (outside of the Pixel 3) we’ve used recently.Smoothness, responsiveness, and blazing speed makes the ROG Phone a pleasure to use.Then there is the wealth of options, features, and settings for gamers. The most notable are AirTriggers, which make use of the phone’s squeezable body, just like the Google Pixel. They can activate certain features, like switching on the phone’s X Mode, or as virtual shoulder buttons for games. It’s confusing to set up though, and requires stopping mid-game, activating AirTriggers, then placing floating buttons over the on-screen controls. They do work; but the phone’s large size makes it awkward to hold when using the shoulder buttons.The aforementioned X Mode closes open apps, frees up memory, and gives the processor a boost. You use it when playing games, for maximum efficiency and performance, at the expense of battery life. With X Mode active, the phone could get a little warmer than usual, so Asus includes a clip-on fan for the ROG Phone. Yes, really. It’s called the AeroActive Cooler, and it’s very silly indeed. Yes, cooler running devices are more efficient and should perform better, but we noticed no difference with it on or off.The list goes on. You can connect to a YouTube or Twitch account to live stream directly from the phone, automatically reject incoming calls when playing, and even set individual profiles for each game. The breadth of customization is impressive, and shows Asus’s understanding of this demanding market. It’s hard to imagine what’s missing for the mobile gamer here; but you’ll have to be a dedicated player to make use of all the features. Casual players will find it overkill; but will still appreciate the obvious performance advantages.The Asus ROG Phone is obviously a gamer’s dream phone. However, it’s not a console, and needs to meet all our smartphone demands that don’t center around gaming. The camera is arguably the most important non-game aspect, and something that the ROG Phone’s main competitor, the Razer Phone, neglected for the original and the sequel. Can the ROG Phone beat it? Yes.			It has a pair of lenses on the back, a single Sony 12-megapixel lens with an f/1.8 aperture, 4-axis optical image stabilization, 1.4-micron pixel size, and phase-detection autofocus. It’s joined by a second 120-degree wide-angle lens, for a setup that’s similar to the LG G7. It also has a 48-megapixel Super Resolution mode. We’ve been very happy with the photos it has taken, and enjoyed the creative opportunities presented by the wide-angle camera, which is surprisingly happy in low lowlight too.			Sunny day shots have a social media-friendly amount of saturation, but not so they’re unpleasant. Blue skies pop, shadows are minimized with HDR, and there’s plenty of detail. Indoors, the camera does struggle a little with poor lighting, revealing less detail than we’d like when shooting food photos. The wide-angle camera is great, and even if poor lighting can produce great images. The bokeh mode works very well, and there are various modes to play with, including a selfie panorama on the front camera.There’s no special mode to cope with these low-light issues, so it can’t beat phones like the OnePlus 6T, the Pixel 3 XL, and the Huawei Mate 20. However, for a phone where the camera is not the main focus of its ability, the ROG Phone still impresses, and will satisfy most people considering this phone.We’ve already mentioned the sheer amount of power that comes from the speed-binned Snapdragon 845 processor, and how it enhances all aspects of the device; but what about some benchmarks? It’s worth noting that before using these apps, the ROG Phone prompted us to use X Mode, which boosts the device’s performance.AnTuTu 3D: 299452 (with X Mode active)Geekbench 4: 2387 Single Core/8400 Multi Core (with X Mode active)3DMark Sling Shot Extreme: 3436 (Vulkan, with X Mode active)This is the highest AnTuTu score we’ve seen, beating the OnePlus 6T, but the Geekbench 4 mark is lower than the Razer Phone 2. It beats the Honor Play in all categories; but not as much as you’d expect in the crucial 3DMark gaming test.The Asus ROG Phone has Android 8.1 with ZenUI over the top, resulting in a highly customized version of Android. It’s drastically different, visually, from Android on the Pixel 3 XL or OnePlus 6T for example, with stylized icons, flashy animations, special modes and menus, and other unique designs. It’s not going to be to everyone’s taste, and like the overall look of the phone itself, it screams “gaming phone.”However, it operates perfectly well. The issues we had with the Zenfone 5Z weren’t prominent here, perhaps due to the phone not having a notch, and the massive amount of power avoided any slowdown or annoyances from the user interface. Notifications showed on the lock screen but cannot be interacted with, and there are no markers on icons. Hardcore gamers used to tinkering with PC settings may love all the tweaks Asus offers, but everyone else will quickly forget them. Android 8.1 is also out of date now, and the phone had Google’s August 2018 security patch installed, and we are concerned software updates may not arrive on a timely basis.A lovely 4,000mAh battery keeps the ROG Phone going, and depending on your use, will do so for a couple of days. If you’re gaming hard, then you won’t get anywhere near that; but the clever side placement of the accessory port means the phone can remain plugged in while you play, without the cable getting in the way. This is the only situation where the AeroActive Cooler comes in handy, as charging makes the phone hotter, and the fan keeps temperatures under control and performance at its best.Playing for several hours across a variety of games saw the battery take a serious hit. With X Mode on, the logo pulsating on the back of the body, and the brightness at maximum, you can say goodbye to at least 50-percent battery after approximately two hours total of gaming. Do this, and the battery will last a day. Still not bad. Sadly, the phone does not have wireless charging.It’s exactly what you want from a gaming phone.The screen can’t match the Razer Phone 2’s 120Hz refresh rate; but it still has 90Hz, and we didn’t notice a lack of smoothness when playing games. Quite the opposite. It’s an OLED panel, has a low 1ms response rate, and handles HDR content as well. It’s exactly what you want from a gaming phone, with beautiful contrast, inky blacks, high resolution, and stunning colors. It’s as good as any to its competitors.We dislike the fingerprint sensor. Not only did it refuse to recognize our fingerprint consistently and on the first try, but its positioning is awkward. Thankfully, the phone’s face unlock feature is fast and reliable.There are two versions of the ROG Phone available. A $900 model with 128GB of internal storage, or a 512GB version for $1,100. It comes with the AeroActive Cooler in the box, and other accessories — such as a controller and a dock — will be available before the end of the year. There’s a $230 Mobile Desktop Dock, a $400 TwinView Dock with a second screen and physical controls, and a special controller add-on for $90. Asus also makes its own $60 case for the phone.Asus sells the phone, which is suitable for GSM networks, through its own online store, Amazon, and in Microsoft retail stores. The phone’s warranty lasts 12 months, and covers faults, and defects caused by manufacturing. The Asus ROG Phone will also launch in the U.K. soon, with prices to be announced.The Asus ROG Phone is a supremely capable gaming smartphone, that due to an impressive all-round ability and masses of power, is suitable for everyone and not just gamers. We prefer the style to the Razer Phone 2, praise the presence of an OLED screen and a headphone jack, and consider the speed-binned Snapdragon 845 a genuine reason to buy the phone.If you want a gaming phone, the Razer Phone 2 is the most obvious direct competitor; but it’s not quite the all-rounder the ROG Phone is. If you want a gaming phone without the massive price, the Honor Play is also a great purchase. The iPhone XS and XS Max are also excellent gaming smartphones, due to the A12 Bionic processor and considerable developer support.No other phone comes with a speed-binned Snapdragon 845 processor, but the standard chip is in plenty of other Android phones, including the Pixel 3 XL, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, the OnePlus 6T, and the LG G7. All are excellent phones, and will play games with similar aplomb; just without all the extra gaming features. Casual gamers would be wise to consider them instead.You’re not going to worry about speed for a while, or storage space if you go for the 512GB model. There’s water resistance, but not enough to provide an IP68 rating, and the body is made from glass, so it’ll break if you drop it on something solid. This aside, expect it to last easily two years. However, as with all gaming machines, software takes advantage of new hardware developments that come along, which may leave the ROG Phone behind after that time.Yes, it’s excellent. And for once, it’s not just gamers that should consider buying a gaming phone. If you love the styling, like playing games casually, and want masses of power, it’s still a great buy. For mobile gamers though, it should be at the top of your wish list."
111,Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018),Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-a9-2018-review/,"Samsung sees what OnePlus, Honor, Nokia, and several other smartphone brands are doing with strong mid-range smartphones, and has been wondering why its own Galaxy A series devices aren’t attracting the same level of attention. It’s probably because until now, they haven’t been all that exciting. But with the new 2018 Galaxy A9, Samsung has given us all something to gaze upon with envious eyes. The Galaxy A9 stares back through four camera lenses on the rear.It’s a world first feature — there have been phones with more camera lenses, but this is the first with four on the back — and is especially notable because Samsung has added a desirable feature to an A series phone that you won’t find on flagship Galaxy S devices. Stacked vertically on the left of the A9, the four lens setup consists of a 24-megapixel main lens with an f/1.7 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth camera with an f/2.2 aperture, a 10-megapixel f/2.4 aperture ultra-wide lens, and finally an 8-megapixel telephoto lens, also with an f/2.4 aperture.The Galaxy A9’s quad-lens camera array covers all the bases. You can take strong standard photos in low light, bokeh-style portrait shots using Samsung’s Live Focus mode, ultra wide photos with a 120-degree viewing angle to match human vision, and zoom in with the 2x optical zoom feature. There really isn’t anything missing here, and it fits perfectly with Samsung’s target market — Instagram fans, and those who want to take the best, and most shareable photos without buying a flagship device.How did it perform? We used the camera inside on a very sunny day, so conditions were challenging. We loved the simplicity of switching between the modes, as it’s an obvious button in the viewfinder, and there was no lag when we did so.Putting a quad-lens camera on the back of the Galaxy A9 is quite daring for Samsung.Live Focus is something we’ve enjoyed on the Galaxy Note 9 and the Galaxy S9 Plus, and it also worked well here with clear on-screen instructions and strong end results. The ultra wide camera has a noticeable fisheye effect, something LG has moved away from with the G7 ThinQ, and the difference in aperture was obvious too, with the ultra wide lens not coping with the bright conditions in the same way as the regular lens.It was a very limited test, but we were impressed at the camera’s versatility. This level of functionality is rare on any phone, let alone one that’s not classed as a flagship. Samsung has even squeezed in its scene recognition technology that debuted on the Galaxy Note 9. The camera app is the same as you’ll find on other Samsung phones too, and it was speedy, logical, and feature packed. The only phone with this type of versatility is the LG V40 ThinQ, which packs three cameras on the rear, and two on the front.Putting a quad-lens camera on the back of the Galaxy A9 is quite daring for Samsung, which has routinely made decent but uninspired A series phones. We’re pleased to see the investment in the camera hasn’t stopped it making the rest of the phone feel and work in a premium fashion. The body is made from glass and aluminium, and is very comfortable and light in the hand. The 6.3-inch screen looks wonderful, and it’s another excellent example of Samsung’s Super AMOLED panels, with a Full HD+ resolution here.If the camera turns your head, it’ll be one of the superb color choices that you notice next. There are three to choose from — a shiny caviar black option for the boring, or a stunning bubblegum pink and lemonade blue for the outrageous. The pink model looks amazing, with real depth and shine to the finish, while not veering into a hideous lipstick pink you’ll want to cover with a case. The lemonade blue reminds us of Huawei’s twilight option on the P20 Pro, with a subtle green-to-blue fade. Both are winners.The software is identical to other Samsung phones, and is based on Android Oreo here, with an update to Android Pie promised in the future. It’s slick and fast, although Bixby is also front and center, which few people will welcome. Samsung’s less-than-successful assistant can be pulled up with a swipe of the screen, or a press of the dedicated Bixby button on the left of the device, which also activates Bixby Voice. Outside of Bixby’s questionable usefulness, Samsung’s version of Android is visually attractive and was pleasantly responsive in our time with the Galaxy A9.We’re as guilty as many others for passing the Galaxy A phones by in the past; but that’s going to stop with the 2018 Galaxy A9.It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 with 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage space, plus room for a MicroSD card up to 512GB in size. No, it’s not a full-on Snapdragon 845 like the OnePlus 6, but for those who aren’t so demanding when it comes to games or multi-tasking, it’ll be plenty fast enough. A 3,800mAh battery should last at least a day, and it has USB Type-C fast charging, but not wireless charging. There’s still Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, and all the other features you’d expect to see on, well, a Galaxy S phone actually.That’s what we liked most about the Galaxy A9. The camera gave us reason to want to use it, and didn’t disappoint when we did, and the rest of the device continued to live up to the expectations we usually have for Samsung’s more expensive phones. We’re as guilty as many others (Samsung included) for passing the Galaxy A phones by in the past; but that’s going to stop with the 2018 Galaxy A9.About the price. There’s a reason the phone feels so close to a Galaxy S phone, as the Galaxy A9 costs 550 British pounds, which converts over to $725. Should the Galaxy A9 launch in the U.S., it will likely be less than this, so we’ll compare using the U.K. price here. It’s slightly more than the 520 pound OnePlus 6, and quite a lot more than the 400 pound Honor 10. We would be more conformable with the cost if it was somewhere in the middle of these two.Still, this is a premium Samsung experience we’re talking about here, from the build quality and materials, right down to the software and camera setup. It has a unique feature you won’t find anywhere else, along with many Galaxy S and Note device features, and the desirable Samsung brand name, all for considerably less than the cheapest S9. Currently, the 64GB Galaxy S9 is 680 British pounds. Looked at through Samsung’s lens, it’s a mid-range phone.Competition is tough around this price, and with the 2018 Galaxy A9, Samsung has got a real contender on its hands, but we can’t help but wish it was just a tiny bit cheaper."
112,Samsung Galaxy Note 9,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review/,"Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 is everything you want in a big-screen phone, and more. It delivers fantastic performance that powers a gorgeous display, has a versatile camera that takes great low-light photos, packs day-long battery life, and it hides an S Pen that’s more useful than ever before.There are some quirks. Bixby is still a little rough around the edges, there’s no Android 9.0 Pie, and did we mention it costs $1,000? The cheaper Galaxy S9 Plus has similar features, and for most people, it’s all the phone you need. But it’s the little refinements in the Note 9 that make it exceptional, and worth its high price of admission.It’s tough to tell the difference between last year’s Galaxy Note 8 and the Note 9 from the front. Like the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, it’s all about refining the design.The Note 9 has a slightly larger 6.4-inch screen, but it’s a tad shorter, wider, and thicker than the Note 8. The edges of the screen curve toward the rear, making the phone comfortable to hold, and the flat edges on the sides help with maintaining a tight grip. The buttons around the phone are clicky and easy to access (we’ll get to the special Bixby button later), and there’s also no notch on the display to disrupt the edge-to-edge screen experience.The 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen is absolute perfection. The screen’s 2,960 x 1,440 resolution makes the screen incredibly sharp, though you need to switch it on, as the default resolution is 2,220 x 1,080 to conserve battery life (though it still looks good). Colors are well saturated and not overbearing, and blacks are as deep as the ocean’s depths. HDR-supported content like Luke Cage on Netflix looks fantastic, especially when paired with the massive edge-to-edge screen. Topping it all off are loud stereo speakers that make this the perfect entertainment machine, and a headphone jack is icing on the cake.The 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen is absolute perfection.The glass rear is where you’ll start noticing design changes over the Note 8. Notably, the fingerprint sensor is in a more sensible location below the camera module. Samsung received plenty of criticism last year for the placement of the sensor, and thankfully it has listened. We think it’s still too high, but you can forgo it by using Intelligent Scan, which uses your face and iris to unlock the phone, and works well.Like most high-end smartphones this year, the Galaxy Note 9 is powered by a Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor, which is accompanied by 6GB of RAM. This is among the fastest Android phones we’ve seen to date, and here are a few benchmark results proving it:The AnTuTu score is the highest we’ve ever recorded for a smartphone, landing right above the Galaxy S9 Plus, which scored 263,591. While benchmarks don’t necessarily reflect real world performance, we haven’t run into any performance issues on the Note 9, and there’s a good reason why.Samsung has outfitted a water carbon cooling system to keep the processor cool. There’s water in the phone — you heard that right – though it’s a miniscule amount. Intensive tasks like a graphics-heavy game can put a lot of strain on a processor and cause it to heat up, which then throttles performance. A cooler processor means you’ll be able to run the app or game longer, and there’s a lower chance of running into performance issues.We played Fortnite for more than 30 minutes and didn’t encounter a hint of lag.We played the Fortnite: Battle Royale beta for more than 30 minutes straight and didn’t encounter a hint of lag. The phone also didn’t become as hot as we’d anticipated, though battery life did take a hit, dropping about 16 percent. Throw anything at the Note 9 — it can take it.The base model comes with 128GB of storage, but there’s also an 8GB RAM variant paired with a massive 512GB of storage. If you still need more space, there’s a MicroSD card slot.Google recently released Android 9.0 Pie, and Samsung had an opportunity to launch its latest smartphone with the brand new version of the mobile operating system. They botched it.Pie aside, the Android 8.1 Oreo software is the same as the Galaxy S9, with the Samsung Experience skin layered over. It’s much improved over Samsung’s old TouchWiz skin, and there’s plenty of customization options and features you can turn on and tweak to your liking.The Samsung apps installed are genuinely useful. Samsung Pay, for example, lets you make contactless payments anywhere a credit card is accepted; and Samsung Health can track your heart rate and stress levels.The S Pen is what makes the Galaxy Note 9 unique, but for too long we’ve felt it doesn’t have enough distinguishing features for us to use it on a daily basis. We only used it to draw, and occasionally scribble some notes through the handy Screen-off Memo feature. But with the Note 9, Samsung has made the S Pen fun to use, and it’s the most we’ve ever used the stylus on a Note smartphone.Samsung has outfitted the stylus with a supercapacitor battery that charges to full after just 40 seconds of sitting inside the Note 9.The stylus now has Bluetooth Low Energy inside, so you can use it as a remote to control functions of the Note 9 up to 30 feet away. By default, when you take the S Pen out and press and hold the button, the camera launches. Tap the button once to snap a photo and double tap it to swap between the front and rear camera. This alone enables so many unique opportunities to up your photography game and get yourself in the shot, and it makes taking group photos much easier. It’s open to third-party developers, so expect to see other apps making use of this remote function.One thing that bothered us is how the yellow S Pen on the Ocean Blue model writes in yellow, but when you save the Screen-off Memo in the Notes app, it’s saved on a white background making it tough to read. You can turn off the yellow color, but we’d like to see Samsung add a black background option for the Notes app.The S Pen now needs to be charged due to its Bluetooth capabilities, but Samsung has outfitted the stylus with a supercapacitor battery that charges to full after just 40 seconds of sitting inside the Note 9. That will give you 30 minutes of use. We’ve yet to see the S Pen die, and we don’t think most people ever will.Samsung has added a slew of new features in Bixby, the voice assistant that has its own dedicated button on the left side of the phone. The button is still frustrating because it’s so easy to accidentally press, but Bixby itself is (a bit) more useful.Bixby works best with controlling functions on your smartphone, such as increasing the screen brightness, opening an app, posting to Instagram, and turning off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Google Assistant — which is also available — can do these things, but Bixby has a few aces up its sleeves, such as the ability to install an app from the Play Store. You can also now use the Bixby assistant to find concerts at nearby venues, book restaurants through Yelp’s reservation system, and call an Uber.Yet Bixby still struggles with context. For example, we asked it for former President Barack Obama’s age, then said, “What about his wife?” That stumped Bixby. We did the same to Google Assistant, and it was able to accurately understand we were asking for Michelle Obama’s age. Try asking a few contextual questions like this and it’s easy to see how Google Assistant is much better.Bixby Home, on the other hand, hasn’t changed much, and it’s still a waste of space. It’s still laggy, and we’ve yet to see it provide anything useful. Bixby Vision can now convert documents to PDFs just by pointing the camera at a piece of paper, which is handy, but no game-changer. And despite the Note 9’s stellar performance, that part of the camera app is still sluggish.The Note 9’s dual-camera is the same as what you’ll find on the Galaxy S9 Plus. A 12-megapixel lens with optical image stabilization (OIS) and variable aperture — the ability to switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4 aperture based on lighting — is paired with a second 12-megapixel lens with a f/2.4 aperture and OIS. The latter lens is used for Samsung’s Live Focus (portrait mode), and it also enables 2x optical zoom. What makes the Note 9 camera unique is artificial intelligence, which enables two features; Scene Optimizer and Flaw Detection.Similar to scene recognition technology found on Huawei and LG phones, the Note 9’s camera can detect up to 20 scenes, from a sunset to a pet, and can tweak the photo to match that scene. If you point the camera at a sunset and snap a photo, the phone knows how to tune the exposure, color, and contrast of the photo to make it look better.Scene identification takes a couple seconds — sometimes more — and it can have trouble identifying scenes it should know. When it does work, the improvements it makes are so small it can be tough finding the differences, so we brought along a Galaxy S9 Plus to compare.For the most part, we do like the changes Scene Optimizer makes. We found it often works best on flowers and trees, where it cranks the saturation up just enough to make colors pop. We haven’t noticed much of a difference when it recognizes pets or people, and we’re not fans of what it does to food — it essentially boosts the saturation.The following two photos are from the Note 9, one with Scene Optimizer turned off. The photo with it turned off has much better white balance, and it’s the one we’d share.Flaw Detection is the second feature that uses A.I., and it issues alerts in the camera app when it thinks you may have taken a blurry photo, if there’s a smudge on the camera, if there’s too much backlight in your shot, or if someone blinked. It’s not perfect, but it gives you a chance to retake a shot on the fly.You won’t have any qualms about daylight photos taken on this camera — they’re sharp, colorful, and the camera handles HDR well. The 2x optical zoom performs, though switching to it takes a moment longer than we’d like.The Note 9 remains just as impressive in low light. Photos aren’t inundated with grain, details aren’t too fuzzy, and while you may end up with the occasional blurry photo, you will usually satisfied. This is the best low-light smartphone camera you can buy in the U.S.Live Focus, Samsung’s portrait mode feature that adds blur behind subjects, hasn’t improved. It can certainly take some good bokeh photos, but the camera smooths over a lot of details on the subject’s face, making things look fuzzy.Flipping over to the front-facing 8-megapixel lens, which has a f/1.7 aperture, selfies look good, even in low light without the help of a flash. AR Emojis are still here, and Samsung has added more customization options to make them look more personalized. The face tracking feature is still nowhere near as good as Apple’s Memoji or Animoji, but there’s a growing list of characters you can turn into, including those from The Incredibles and Frozen. With a large 4,000mAh battery inside, we expected the Note 9 to last more than a full day, like the Huawei P20 Pro. Sadly, it doesn’t, but that doesn’t mean we’re unhappy. We never felt battery anxious, and we’ve yet to see it hit zero percent. It can get you through a full day of medium to heavy use, but not much more. With lighter use, you’ll be able to carry this phone to your second day on a single charge.It can get you through a full day of medium to heavy use, but not much more.The Note 9 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 2.0 for faster charging speeds. We plugged in our device when it had 15 percent left at 7:30 p.m., and it hit 95 percent by 9 p.m. We’ve witnessed faster charging on other phones, so these numbers aren’t too impressive. As always, the Note 9 supports fast wireless charging through the Qi standard, but it won’t juice up as quickly as wired charging.The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costs $1,000 for the 128GB and 6GB RAM model, and the 512GB and 8GB version will set you back a whopping $1,250.

It’s hardly worth upgrading to, however, if you have a Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S9, or Galaxy S9 Plus.Yes, the Galaxy S9 Plus. The two phones share many similarities including the processor and the camera, and if you don’t care about the S Pen, then the S9 Plus is the phone you should buy. You’ll even save money. Alternatively, the LG G7 ThinQ is a solid option, though itsFrom s camera isn’t as goodIt’s at this point that we would recommend the Google Pixel 2 and the iPhone X, but Apple will be releasing new iPhones in September, and Google will be releasing new Pixel phones in October, so we recommend waiting.If you’re looking for a cheaper option, consider the OnePlus 6. It has the same processor, slick software, great design, is priced at $530. Sadly, it only works on AT&T and T-Mobile.The Galaxy Note 9 is sandwiched in Gorilla Glass 5, which is strong, but it likely won’t survive a drop without suffering scratches or cracks. We strongly recommend grabbing a case. The phone is thankfully IP68 water- and dust-resistant, so it should survive a drop in the pool.You should expect to see this phone receive two Android version upgrades, and we expect the phone to last more than four years.Yes.

113,Samsung Galaxy S9,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/,"Small smartphones tend to not get much love. They often aren’t as feature-packed as their larger counterparts, which is why it was refreshing to see the only differences between the original 2016 Google Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as last year’s Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, were the size and battery.Unfortunately, trends show things are quickly going back to the norm. The Pixel 2 XL differentiated from the Pixel 2 with a bezel-less design, and the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact doesn’t have wireless charging or the new Dynamic Vibration System found in the larger Xperia XZ2. And with the new Galaxy S9, you won’t find the versatile dual-camera system that’s present in the larger Galaxy S9 Plus. Are the extra features in the Galaxy S9 Plus worth the money, or will you be satisfied with a smaller phone? Let’s take a closer look.Interested in the Galaxy S9 Plus? Check out our in-depth review.The Galaxy S9 is the perfect-sized phone. It’s easy to wrap our palms around this smooth 5.8-inch device, and our fingers ergonomically rest on the curved edges along the S9’s frame. The power button on the right edge sits in an easy-to-access position, as does the Bixby button on the left edge. It’s a shame we’ve turned off Bixby’s functionality, so the button remains useless — more on that later.Despite the small size, the volume rocker on the left edge is still a little too hard to reach, just like it is on the Galaxy S9 Plus. We have to shuffle the phone a little lower to tap it.On the bottom edge of the phone is a USB-Type C charging port, with a bottom-firing speaker and a headphone jack. You’ll be pleased to learn that Samsung finally uses stereo sound — the top earpiece works with the bottom-firing speaker for AKG-tuned, Dolby Atmos audio. Music is easily room-filling, with rich, clear sound, but weak bass. It’s a step up from Samsung’s previous smartphones, but dual front-facing speakers like those on the Pixel 2 would be an even better addition — we often end up covering the bottom-firing speaker when holding the phone in landscape mode.The Galaxy S9 is the perfect-sized phone.The back of the S9 isn’t drastically different from years past. Samsung has essentially flipped its horizontal camera and fingerprint sensor setup vertically, making it easier to place your finger. Sadly, it’s still easy to touch the camera sensor because the fingerprint module isn’t distinguished enough from the camera frame, and both are still too close to each other. Speaking of fingerprints, get ready to carry a microfiber cloth or use a case with the S9 — otherwise you’ll spend countless minutes getting rid of smudges and fingerprints off the glossy, glass back.Size is the Galaxy S9’s strength here. The S9 is slightly shorter than last year’s S8, but you get the same 5.8-inch screen thanks to the smaller bezels surrounding the display. After going between the S9 Plus and the S9, we much prefer the smaller phone. It’s comfortable and easy to hold, while still being a great entertainment device with a large display and great sound.In terms of colors, a Sunrise Gold version is now available, alongside Midnight Black, Coral Blue, and Lilac Purple.It may have been around for a year, but we still can’t stop gazing at Samsung’s Infinity Display. Samsung has taken the effort to mask all the cameras and sensors sitting in the bezel of the phone, making it look like the screen blends in with the edges, which creates a more immersive viewing experience.The 5.8-inch screen size is the same as the S8, but there are some improvements in the AMOLED panel. Colors are incredibly vibrant, but still accurate, and the screen gets brilliantly bright. The S9 has a Quad HD+ (2,960 × 1,440 pixel) resolution, just like the Galaxy S9 Plus, which means it’s even sharper than its larger brother because it packs more pixels (570 pixels-per-inch to be exact).The end result is a beautiful screen that’s perfect for binge-watching the new season of Jessica Jones. The S9 supports HDR10 after all, so apps like Netflix, YouTube, and HBO with HDR10 content look their absolute best on this phone. Sure, the Galaxy S9 Plus has more screen real estate, but we’re happy watching shows and movies on the smaller S9 as well.The Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus are the first phones we’ve tested with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor, and we’re happy to announce the new chipset delivers great performance. Apps open quickly, and moving throughout the user interface is mostly smooth. We say mostly because we have encountered the occasional stutter, which reminds us of Samsung’s TouchWiz launcher days.What impressed us more is gaming performance. The Snapdragon 845 chip boasts bigger graphics improvements, and it shows. Games like Tekken and The Sims: Mobile run without a hitch, and the phone doesn’t get too warm after we were playing for a while.Here are a few results from benchmark tests:The scores are slightly lower than what we received on the Galaxy S9 Plus, and that may be due to the 6GB of RAM in the larger phone — the regular S9 only has 4GB. More RAM is beneficial when you’re doing a lot of multitasking, and it also helps future-proof the phone. Still, 4GB is plenty for most people, and the S9’s scores are way higher than the Pixel 2 and almost all Android flagship smartphones from 2017. Needless to say, the Galaxy S9 can easily handle multitasking, gaming, and everyday tasks without issues. You’ll be satisfied with performance on this phone.The S9 comes with 64GB of storage, but there’s a 128GB model and a 256GB model available as well. A MicroSD card slot lets you add in more space if you need it.The biggest difference between the S9 Plus and the S9, other than size, is the extra camera on the rear of the S9 Plus. Like many other flagship smartphones, the dual-camera system offers features like 2x optical zoom and a Portrait Mode for a blurred background effect, as well as a wide-angle camera on certain devices like the LG V30. You won’t get any of that on the small Galaxy S9, but you do get a killer single 12-megapixel camera with variable aperture.That doesn’t sound as cool, but you’ll undoubtedly be more than satisfied and impressed with the photos — specifically the low-light photos — the S9 captures. As we’ve explained before, variable aperture is when the camera can switch between two apertures: In the S9’s case, it can switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4.The aperture is the hole in the camera that lets light into the sensor. The S9’s f/1.5 is the widest aperture available on a smartphone currently, and that means it can absorb a lot of light because the hole is larger (the lower the number, the wider the aperture). The problem with having such a wide aperture is that the details in the photograph are not as sharp. So if you compare a daylight photo taken with the f/1.5 aperture versus the f/2.4 aperture, the latter photo will be far more detailed.You do get a killer single 12-megapixel camera with variable aperture.Thankfully, you don’t need to think about any of this because Samsung hides all this complicated mechanical machinery away from the user interface. Simply open the camera app, tap the shutter icon, and the S9 will take a great photo. It will default to the f/2.4 aperture most of the time, so your photos remain sharp, but when it detects poor lighting, it will automatically switch to the f/1.5 aperture. These photos are noticeably brighter than the S9’s competitors, and while they may be a little fuzzy, they’re still excellent considering the lighting conditions. You can also manually switch apertures in the camera’s Pro mode.What’s even more impressive is Samsung’s multi-frame noise-reduction image processing, which may not sound interesting, but is important. We’ve all taken photos at night only to find a lot of grain or “noise” ruining the picture. When you tap the shutter icon on the Galaxy S9, the phone captures 12 photos it then compiles to eliminate as much noise as possible. When you compare low-light photos with the Google Pixel 2, for example, the difference in noise is astounding, and it always makes for a better photo.There’s also the Super Slow Motion feature, where you can take 720p videos that are 32 times slower than real life. It’s a fun addition into the camera app, though it does take some getting used to when trying to capture fast-moving scenes. Samsung has also taken a page out of Apple’s book with AR Emojis, mimicking Animojis that debuted on the iPhone X. We’re not fans of how AR Emojis look — though some people on our staff think they look great. More importantly, the motion-capture technology used to create and send AR Emoji videos is not good at all. Animojis remain far superior. Like Animojis, however, we expect no one to talk about this feature after a month.We’re genuinely impressed at the low-light achievements here with Samsung’s “reimagined” camera, and the Super Slow Motion addition is genuinely fun. We do still think the Galaxy S9 Plus’ second camera is worth the extra money, though. We kept trying to use the S9-exclusive 2x optical zoom on the regular S9, only because taking detailed photos of objects further away makes the camera so versatile. Live Focus is also a handy and fun feature to have, and the “Selective Focus” software version feature on the S9 doesn’t compare.If those two latter features aren’t important to you, then you’ll still be overjoyed with the Galaxy S9’s camera.The Galaxy S9 runs Android 8.0 Oreo, but it’s layered with the Samsung Experience 9.0 user interface. The software looks far better than Samsung’s old TouchWiz UI, and there’s plenty of customization options to personalize your S9.Samsung has taken its sweet time to update its devices to the latest version of Android.For example, you can change the exact color of the clock on the lock screen, not to mention choosing a clock design from a variety of options. The sheer amount of customization options are great, and they don’t feel overwhelming. Most people won’t touch a lot of these settings, but we’re happy to know they are there.With all this customization, however, you would think Samsung would let people remap the Bixby button. Bixby is Samsung’s artificially intelligent assistant first introduced in the Galaxy S8. It’s meant to be an easy way to perform traditional touch functions on your phone with your voice. It can be handy sometimes, but we’ve generally found the experience to be slower and not as reliable as Google Assistant, which you can access by pressing and holding the home button. Sliding the home screen to the right to open Bixby Home is sluggish, and there never really seems to be any useful information here.There are a few new additions to Bixby Vision — the camera part of Bixby — including Makeup, Food, and improved instant language translation. The latter two are wonky, and never completely reliable, but we’ve found Makeup to be fun and useful. It leverages technology from a company called ModiFace, and it lets you layer makeup products over your face. If you like the way a product looks on your face, tap the link and you can purchase it from the website. Right now, Makeup has Sephora products, but Samsung said to expect more, like Cover Girl, soon.While Bixby can be annoying, the biggest disappointment in terms of software is updates. It’s why the Pixel 2 XL remains our top Android phone, because version and security updates are important to us, and Samsung has taken its sweet time to update its devices to the latest version of Android. Android 8.0 Oreo came out back in August 2017, and the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus are still on a beta. With Android P’s first developer preview now available, don’t expect to have it on the S9 or S9 Plus until early 2019. If you care about fast software updates, get a Google Pixel.If you’re a power user, don’t expect to get through a day without charging up the Galaxy S9. After using it heavily for watching YouTube videos, taking photos, playing video games, and browsing the web, we reached 7 percent by 6 p.m. That’s not good at all, and you can easily find better battery life with the competition, especially the Huawei Mate 10 Pro.If you don’t use the phone as much, you’ll obviously see better battery life. You can also head to the device manager settings to optimize the battery and get as much time out of it as possible. On a light day of use, we managed 38 percent by 5 p.m., starting with a full charge at 7:30 a.m.The phone supports fast wireless and wired charging, so you have plenty of ways to charge it back to full strength quickly.The Galaxy S9 costs $720 from Samsung, or you can purchase it on a monthly payment plan. You can also buy it through carriers and other retailers, and you can check out our buying guide for more details and deals.Samsung offers a one-year limited warranty that protects the phone from manufacturing defects. You can purchase Samsung Premium Care for an extended warranty, as well as other features.The Galaxy S9 is a comfortable and compact phone that offers a fantastic camera and great performance, but is it one of the best smartphones on the market?We do think the S9 Plus is worth it for the second, versatile camera, but the S9’s perfect size makes it hard to ignore.Is there a better alternative?Maybe. The Google Pixel 2 is another small phone with fluid performance and an excellent camera, and you get fast Android version and security updates. The problem is that it doesn’t feature a bezel-less design, so it looks quite dated.If you don’t care about operating system, there’s always the iPhone X, which is smaller than the iPhone 8 Plus, or the iPhone 8. Both are excellent phones with similar strengths as the Google Pixel 2, and the iPhone X has that contemporary, stylish look you want. Check out our best small phones guide for more.How long will it last?Expect the Galaxy S9 to last you three or more years. It’s IP68 water- and dust-resistant, so it will survive dips in the pool, but it’s covered in glass, so you might want to protect it with a case. Samsung issues software updates for two years, so you will start to see performance dips by then, especially since the battery will start to depreciate.Should you buy it?Yes. If you don’t care about the extra camera on the Galaxy S9 Plus, the Galaxy S9 is an excellent device with a stellar camera, great performance, and brilliant hardware.Updated on June 20: We’ve added information about the Sunrise Gold color option, as well as the 128GB and 256GB models that are available."
114,Sony Xperia XZ2,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-review/,"After half a decade of the same design philosophy for its Xperia smartphones, Sony is finally changing things up. It starts with the cream of the crop, the Sony Xperia XZ2, which features a design motif the company calls “Ambient Flow.” It’s meant to emphasize curves and ergonomics — a stark contrast from the angular designs of Sony’s previous phones.The Xperia XZ2 checks off a lot of boxes. It has fantastic performance, good battery life, and its camera is more than capable. But it’s held back by a few software bugs, and its new design language needs to go back to the drawing board for a little more refinement.The bezel-less trend — where the edges surrounding a smartphone’s screen are minimized — kicked off more than a year ago, but Sony apparently just noticed. It has finally trimmed down those edges on the Xperia XZ2, but they’re still not as slim as most of the competition. Even the OnePlus 6, which is $270 cheaper, has thinner bezels than the XZ2. The front of the phone is a marked improvement over Sony’s previous devices, but it still manages to look a tad dated among the rest of the smartphone market.Thankfully, Sony goes against the grain with dual front-facing stereo speakers, an uncommon sight among flagship phones. The earpiece doubles as a speaker at the top, and the second speaker is hardly noticeable, sitting at the very bottom edge below a Sony logo. They get loud enough to hear in the busy outdoors, but the audio quality is average. Nothing pops, and bass is virtually nonexistent. We’ve heard better from the likes of the LG G7 ThinQ, and the HTC U12 Plus.It’s a 5.7-inch LCD screen on the front, with a 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution. The screen supports HDR content, and Sony’s X-Reality for mobile engine can also upscale standard content to HDR. We can’t deny that videos look crisp and colorful, but when you turn this auto-upscaling feature off, the difference is negligible.Blacks aren’t as deep as you’d find on an OLED panel, but the screen gets bright enough to see outdoors. It’s tough to find any problems with the screen here, and we think almost everyone will be plenty satisfied. The Xperia XZ2’s display is protected by Gorilla Glass 5, which is also on the back of the phone.A USB Type-C charging port sits at the bottom, the SIM tray is at the top, and there’s no headphone jack. All the buttons are on the right edge: There’s a volume rocker at the top, which is a tad too high to reach, a power button that’s a little too centered, and a shutter button at the bottom, which you can use in landscape mode to snap some photos. We found ourselves often shuffling the phone in our hands to be able to reach some of these buttons, a problem that extends to the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone.Sony’s new design language needs to go back to the drawing board for a little more refinement.The back of the XZ2 is all glass like most smartphones these days, and it looks fantastic. The edges are thinner than the center, so the phone elegantly curves in your palm. The flash, camera, and fingerprint sensor placement are symmetrical, making the back of the phone look incredibly futuristic, perhaps even robotic. It is a fingerprint magnet, sadly, and it will easily slide off any surface — it’s that slippery.Our main problem — and this may be limited to people with large hands — is that the single-lens camera is exactly where the fingerprint sensor should be. The sensor is too low, and we constantly placed our finger on the camera lens to try and unlock the phone. It’s tough to get used to the lower fingerprint sensor, because it feels unnatural. We gave it to a few other co-workers, with varying palm sizes, and they too said the fingerprint sensor was far too low.The Xperia XZ2 also feels really chunky, and while it is ergonomic in the hand with its curved back, it’s a little heavy (198 grams). It does feel like a premium, expensive phone, but we’re not sure why it needs to be 11.1mm thick, especially since it only has a 3,180mAh battery. The Huawei P20 Pro has a 4,000mAh battery, and it’s only 7.8mm thin. The thickness and weight, paired with the slightly dated front design, makes us want to put this phone down back on the table.We recommend heading to a store to check out how the Xperia XZ2 feels in your hand, since it’s such a subjective experience. You may find you like the button placements better than we do.On a more positive note, we love the Ash Pink color option of the XZ2, and you can also choose from Deep Green, Liquid Black, and Liquid Silver. The XZ2 looks good, we just have problems with the position of some buttons and the fingerprint sensor, and the phone is a little too chunky for our tastes.We’ve used quite a few phones with the Snapdragon 845 — the latest chipset from Qualcomm — and even though the Xperia XZ2 uses the same processor with 4GB of RAM, it somehow reacts much quicker. Apps open almost immediately, scrolling is fluid, and games like PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds: Mobile and Transformers: Forged to Fight run without any issues whatsoever.Here are a few benchmark results:The AnTuTu score is a little lower than phones running the same processor, such as the Galaxy S9, which scored 261,876, and the HTC U12 Plus, which scored 250,938. Benchmark scores don’t reflect real-world performance, though, and we found the Xperia to be slightly faster than its peers. Either way, you won’t have any trouble running all sorts of tasks on this phone.We found the Xperia to be slightly faster than its peers.While performance may be stellar, user experience isn’t. The Xperia XZ2 runs Android 8.0 Oreo, but Sony has its own theme layered on top. Some parts of the user interface look really dated, but we were more annoyed at the amount of app crashes we encountered. In everyday usage, a few apps would just crash and disappear from the Recents menu. We received two software updates (we asked Sony what they were for and got no response), which seemed to help, as we haven’t seen as many crashes as before. Still, the occasional one does pop up, which is worrisome.There are a few Sony apps installed, including the 3D Creator app that lets you create a 3D image of a real-life object or face. It’s a little wonky, but the results are surprisingly decent. You can even 3D print your virtual image straight from your phone. Still, it’s a feature we’d never really use outside of trying it out once.One of the highlights — according to Sony — of using the Xperia XZ2 is the Dynamic Vibration System. Sony has essentially increased the size of the vibration motor — the haptics do feel pretty great — but vibrations now are synced with audio from videos and music.What does that mean? When you play a YouTube video and increase or decrease the volume, you’ll see an option to turn on Sony Dynamic Vibration, which allows you to choose a level of intensity. As the video plays, you’ll feel the phone vibrate during  certain parts; like if someone throws a punch, you’ll feel a vibration from the phone to make things feel a little more immersive.We honestly do not feel any more immersive with this feature on. It’s absolutely useless with music, because it feels like the phone is just constantly vibrating, and while the algorithm does a good job of figuring out moments to offer haptic feedback with video, the actual vibration does nothing for us. It’s a feature we immediately turned off after trying it out for a day.Unlike most smartphones these days, there’s no dual-camera setup on the back of the XZ2 — you’ll have to wait for the XZ2 Premium for that. Still, the 19-megapixel lens is quite capable. Photos have good detail with accurate colors, though we think the HDR feature could be a little more effective. It’s a little hit or miss — sometimes photos are well-exposed, and other times the camera tends to overexpose.In mid- to low-light photos, detail starts to take a hit, but the results are still decent. Grain creeps in, but it’s not as noticeable as on some other phones. You may end up with a few blurry and fuzzy photos here, which means you’ll have to retake some photos.The photos the rear camera takes are far from the best we’ve seen, but there’re also not the worst by a long mile. It’s average, but we also never felt like the camera experience encouraged us to take more photos, unlike the Huawei P20 Pro or Google Pixel 2. What’s makes this worse is the camera app is a little sluggish to use. The camera shutter reacts quickly, but photos take some time to process and appear, and launching the camera isn’t as quick as we’d like. Even zooming into photos, you can see details still loading in.Also, remember when we said the fingerprint sensor was placed too low? So is the camera. We have a lot of photos with a finger or two in the shot — especially when we only use one hand. Sony should really have just moved everything a little higher.There’s not too much in the way of features in the camera app. There is a Bokeh mode, though it’s a separate app you need to jump to within the camera app. It’s not very good. Photos look detailed, yes, but the blur is messy and blotchy, and we recommend skipping this feature.						There’s Super Slow Motion video, which means you can shoot at 960 frames per second in Full HD — a step above the Galaxy S9. It’s fun and the slow motion looks great, but it’s tricky to capture the exact moment because it’s not a continuous slow motion; it can only snap a few seconds, so timing is crucial. We wish there was an auto-capture slow motion mode like there is on the Galaxy S9.The camera can also shoot in 4K HDR, and while videos do look good, the camera app crashes frequently in this mode. We’ve even seen continuous “Error” pop-ups that disable the camera, requiring a restart of the phone. Viewing the 4K HDR video on the phone is a little choppy, but it’s spectacularly detailed, and you can zoom in. This feature may not be worth using, not just because it’s unreliable, but because you won’t see much of a difference if you don’t have a screen or laptop to view 4K HDR videos.The 5-megapixel front-facing camera takes selfies well enough, and there is a Pro mode for the rear camera in case you want to fine-tune some settings.The Xperia XZ2 may only have a 3,180mAh battery, but it can last you a full day.The Xperia XZ2 may only have a 3,180mAh battery, but it can last you a full day, even with heavy use. With a lot of video streaming, some music playback, plenty of picture taking, gaming, and web browsing, we ended one work day with 25 percent by 7 p.m.But on average, when we weren’t trying to see how much the battery could take, we ended up with around 40 percent — sometimes more.The phone supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 for fast charging, and there’s also the convenience of wireless charging on board.The Xperia XZ2 costs $800, and it’s available from Best Buy, Focus, Amazon, and BuyDig. It does not work on CDMA networks, meaning you won’t be able to use it on Verizon and Sprint, but it does work on T-Mobile and AT&T.Sony offers a limited one-year warranty from the date of purchase, and it only covers manufacturing defects.The Sony Xperia XZ2 does a lot well, but it doesn’t do anything better than other phones on the market.Yes. If you’re eyeing the Xperia XZ2, we think you’ll like the Galaxy S9 a little more. It’s a tad cheaper, the camera is better, there are more features and a better display, similar battery life and performance, and it looks better. The Google Pixel 2 or 2 XL are also good options, with brilliant cameras, continuous software updates, and great performance. Check out our guide to the best smartphones for more.The Sony Xperia XZ2 will last more than two years. Sony is relatively good about software updates, and the XZ2 can run the Android P beta right now, so we expect this phone to get Android P quickly when it rolls out later this year. The phone feels like a brick, so it might be able to handle a few drops, but you’ll still want to grab a case for it. It is IP68 water-resistant, so it can handle some water.Yes. But only if you absolutely hate the Galaxy S9 or the Google Pixel 2. The Xperia XZ2 is a good phone, but we have issues with parts of its design. While its spotlight features are unique, they aren’t things you would use all the time, and they don’t add much benefit to everyday use."
115,Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-compact-review/,"Like station wagons and iPod repairmen, small phones are a dying breed today. Phone screens continue to get bigger and bigger, and the International Data Corporation reports that “phablets” will overtake regular smartphone shipments by 2019. Smartphone manufacturers often reserve special features for large-screen phones too — the Google Pixel 2 has a duller design compared to the Pixel 2 XL; the Samsung Galaxy S9 doesn’t come with a dual-lens system, unlike the S9 Plus; and HTC launched the U12 Plus without a regular-size U12 at all.But Sony hasn’t given up. While the Xperia XZ2 Compact doesn’t have the same vibration system or sleek design language of the Xperia XZ2, its differences make it a better phone. In fact, it’s one of the best options if you’re looking for a small phone today. Here’s why.Update: We’ve confirmed that our unit is a pre-production unit, which is why it hasn’t received any software updates.The highlight of this phone is in its name; it’s all about size. With a 5-inch screen, the XZ2 Compact will easily fit in every palm. The rear curves inwards at the sides, making it ergonomic and comfortable to hold, and there’s a nice weight to it that makes it feel like a solid, well-built phone. We especially love how little space the XZ2 Compact takes up in pant pockets.The design isn’t as contemporary as the Compact’s bigger brother, the XZ2. The bezels on the front aren’t as svelte as most of the competition, but we’re happy with the varied color options, especially the Moss Green shown here. The rear doesn’t utilize glass, which means there’s no wireless charging, but the phone’s also a little more durable. It’s a simple look, with just a single-lens camera at the top, a fingerprint sensor below, and the Xperia logo at the bottom. There’s even an indicator for where the NFC antenna sits for services like Google Pay.The fingerprint sensor is still a little too low, as it was on the XZ2, but it’s manageable thanks to the Compact’s smaller size, and quick to react.We especially love how little space the XZ2 Compact takes up in pant pockets.All the buttons are on the right edge, with a volume rocker up top, a power button in the middle, and a camera shutter button at the bottom. We’d have liked to see the power button a tad higher — it’s a little too centered for our grip — but adjusting the way we held the phone fixed this issue. Over on the bottom edge is a USB Type-C port for charging.There are two front-facing speakers, and while the bass isn’t as punchy as we’d like, the audio gets plenty loud to hear even outdoors — handy if you want to watch a movie or YouTube video at the park. There’s no headphone jack, but Sony supports a wide-range of high-resolution audio formats, including AptX HD, ensuring your music sounds good over Bluetooth. There’s a USB Type-C to 3.5mm headphone jack converter in the box, too.The 5-inch LCD screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 5, and it packs an 18:9 aspect ratio with 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It’s sharp, colorful, and gets bright enough to view outdoors on a sunny day. Blacks aren’t as dark as those you’d find on an OLED panel, but you won’t have any qualms about screen quality here.We didn’t find ourselves using this phone to watch a lot of video content, at least compared to bigger phones, as the screen feels a little too cramped for it. The XZ2 Compact’s display does support HDR, though, so if you do spend some time on YouTube or Netflix, know that you’re getting excellent visuals. You’ll want to make sure the content you watch supports HDR — for example, Marvel’s Luke Cage season 2 looks great, though we kept the screen close to our face to make sure we could see everything.The Xperia XZ2 Compact fits like a glove in the hand. All parts of the screen are easy to access, and if you increasingly find yourself turned off from large-screen phones, then Sony’s Compact should be on the top of your list.Like the Xperia XZ2, the Compact delivers incredibly speedy performance with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor and 4GB RAM. We didn’t run into any problems at all running graphics-intensive games like PUBG: Mobile and Alto’s Odyssey; the Compact was capable of handling everything we threw at it.Here are a few benchmark results:The Compact’s AnTuTu score is right below the Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus, landing in the top ranks as one of our best performing phones based on benchmark tests. These tests aren’t necessarily a good measure of real-world performance, but it seems to ring true here. You won’t have any performance issues with the XZ2 Compact.The phone comes with 64GB of internal storage, plus support MicroSD cards in case you need more space.The rear 19-megapixel lens captures photos with good detail and great color accuracy.The XZ2 Compact runs Android 8.0 Oreo, and you may be surprised to hear that our device is stuck on the February 1 security patch. There have been regular software updates rolling out consistently to XZ2 and XZ2 Compact units, including the July security patch and other bug fixes, but we’ve yet to see it on our phone. We spoke to a Sony customer service representative, and were told to simply wait for our unit to get the over-the-air update notification, but we’ve since learned we haven’t received updates because our device is a pre-production unit. If you buy the Xperia XZ2 Compact, you should have the latest Android version and security update.Otherwise, the software experience is average. There’s a good deal of bloatware, such as pre-installed Amazon apps that can’t be uninstalled, and a handful of Sony apps we never found particularly useful. One neat app is 3D Creator, which lets you create 3D models of anything with the phone’s camera — you can even send this 3D scan to a 3D printer — though this feature seems tailored for a niche audience.Some parts of Sony’s Android skin look a tad dated, but it’s thankfully customizable, and it’s still simple to operate. We have seen a few apps force closing occasionally, but it never felt frustrating or disruptive to our day-to-day experience.The camera on the XZ2 Compact doesn’t stand out from the strong competition. There’s no dual-camera system here — you’ll have to look at the newer XZ2 Premium for that — but that doesn’t mean the Compact can’t handle its own. The rear 19-megapixel lens captures photos with good detail and great color accuracy.We do have some gripes, such as how the camera app isn’t too fast. It takes a full two seconds or more to launch, and the camera shutter is a tad slow to react. Open a picture in the photo gallery and zoom in, and you’ll notice it always takes a few seconds to load.The camera also takes some time to adjust the exposure in high-contrast scenarios. When there’s a bright sky and a dark foreground, the XZ2 Compact needs a few seconds to process the lighting, but sometimes HDR even feels like it’s non-existent.The true-to-life colors in the XZ2’s 4K HDR video is astounding.We’re quite satisfied with most of the photos the XZ2 Compact takes in low-light scenarios. Grain starts to creep in, but the camera still maintains good color accuracy, and detail is solid. Photos have a higher chance to look blurrier here, though, so you may need a few tries to get the right shot.The bokeh mode, which adds a strong blur behind a subject, is hit or miss. We’ve found it sometimes likes to simply refuse to add a blur, but when it does, it has trouble detecting all the edges around a subject, specifically hair. It can work well — you just need to spend some time with it and get ready to make a few attempts.Shooting video is one of the highlights on the XZ2 Compact. Sony said the Compact, along with the XZ2 and XZ2 Premium, are among the only phones that can capture 4K HDR content. This helps with bringing out more realistic colors in your videos, and manages contrast better. There is a warning that the camera will force close if the phone gets too warm, though your content will always save.So how do videos look? The true-to-life colors are astounding, and the detail the camera captures looks good — but keep in mind you need a 4K HDR display to truly appreciate what you’ve captured. We’re not fans of the phone’s video stabilization, which can make the video look quite janky. We preferred shooting HDR in 1080p, rather than 4K. The camera app also does start to stutter a little if you record a little too long.The other big video feature is super slow motion at 960 frames per second, which is captured in 1080p — a higher resolution than the super slow motion feature on the Galaxy S9. It’s a fun feature, but it really requires lots light to look good, and you need to be accurate when you press the slow-mo button to make sure you can capture the moment at the perfect time.The 5-megapixel camera takes decent selfies, but it’s nothing to write home about. The screen lights up as a flash in dark environments, which is helpful.The XZ2 Compact has a camera that takes great photos in almost all environments, though it doesn’t necessarily excel in one particular area.We’ve found the Xperia XZ2 Compact offers a full day of battery life, based on medium to heavy usage, due to its 2,870mAh battery capacity. Starting around 7:30 a.m. off the charger, with plenty of gaming, video and music streaming, and browsing social media, our device ended up with 32 percent around 5:30 p.m. This would often stretch to 15 percent by midnight or so, with minimal use at home.Typically though, we arrived home around 6 p.m. with a little under 50 percent remaining — that’s with medium to light usage, using the phone mostly to browse the web and take some photos. On weekends, when we didn’t use our phone much, we found about 54 percent remaining by 9 p.m.The Compact supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology, and it sure does charge up quickly. We plugged it in at 10:54 p.m. with 33 percent remaining, and it hit 90 percent by 11:50 p.m. Unlike the XZ2, the Compact does not support wireless charging.The Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact initially cost $650 at launch, but you can grab it for $600 at Best Buy, Amazon, BuyDig, and Focus. It won’t work on Sprint, Boost Mobile, and Virgin Mobile, but it will be perfectly fine on Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile.Sony offers a one-year limited warranty that protects the device from manufacturer defects.The perfectly sized Xperia XZ2 Compact will fit in any pocket, and it comes with excellent performance, a good camera, and day-long battery life.Yes, the Google Pixel 2 is one of the closest phones in size that you’ll find to the Xperia XZ2 Compact. Its camera is better, though the Compact excels in performance thanks to its newer processor. The Galaxy S9 is another option that has similar performance and a great camera, though it’s a tad more expensive. You can check out our guide to the best small phones for more.The Xperia XZ2 Compact will likely last you a little more than three years. It will continue to receive software updates for the next two years, and its life will probably continue for a little while after. It’s protected by a Gorilla Glass 5 screen on the front, but you might still want to grab a case. Thankfully, it’s IP65/68 water-resistant, so it can handle a drop in the pool.Yes. If you’re in the market for a small smartphone, this is one of your best choices right now."
116,Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-premium-review/,"When you think of a $1,000 smartphone, Apple’s iPhone X is the first that comes to mind. It’s forward-thinking, with a nearly bezel-less design, and it packs a class-leading and secure facial-recognition system. Sony’s new Xperia XZ2 Premium also costs $1,000, but it hardly feels like it’s worth as much. It’s one of the most cumbersome phones we’ve held this year, thanks to its ridiculously thick body and dated 16:9 aspect ratio, and it also has thick bezels that make it look like it came straight out of 2015.That being said, the spotlight feature on the XZ2 Premium is something we haven’t seen in any other phone to date: the ability to capture good-looking videos in “extreme low-light conditions.” This dual-camera system is a first for Sony, and it is capable of capturing video up to ISO 12800, which is the highest we’ve seen to date in a smartphone. It’s impressive — especially when compared to phones like the Galaxy Note 9 and the iPhone X — but it wasn’t enough to make us want to use the phone after our review period. Let’s take a closer look.Sony finally introduced a new design motif earlier this year called Ambient Flow, which is meant to accentuate the curves on its phones, making them more ergonomic to hold. It’s an improved look, but we have some problems, some of which we’ve already highlighted in our Xperia XZ2 review, as it looks similar. Ironically, the XZ2 Premium feels less “premium” than the XZ2.The first features you’ll notice about the XZ2 Premium are its size and weight. This is a thick phone that’s also incredibly wide and tall. It will fill every hand — large or small — and it will be difficult to reach certain parts of the 5.8-inch screen without using both hands (or using the one-hand software mode). Its exact dimensions are 157.48 x 78.74 x 12.7mm, and it weighs 232 grams. The Galaxy Note 9 has a 6.4-inch screen, its dimensions are 161.9 x 76.4 x 8.8 mm, and it weighs 201 grams. The Sony phone is wider, thicker, and heavier, despite offering a smaller screen and a smaller battery.The edges around the phone are curvy, it has rounded corners, and the edges on the back slope into the front. That makes it feel natural to hold, but it still remains a cumbersome phone to carry and use. We don’t like how thick it is, and how unnecessarily large it feels in the hand. That being said, we recommend stopping by a store to experience how the XZ2 Premium feels for yourself, as you may prefer a bigger phone. Alternatively, check out the Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact if you want a phone on the opposite end of the spectrum.The spotlight feature on the XZ2 Premium is something we haven’t seen in any other phone.It’s protected by Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back with an aluminum frame around. The glass body and curvy design is a recipe for disaster. When placed on a flat, smooth surface, the Xperia XZ2 Premium has a mind of its own and starts moving around. It’s constantly trying to fall, and much to our dismay, it experienced two drops during our review period. The first is when it slid off a table onto the pavement (at an outdoor restaurant), and the second time it slid out of our pocket at a press conference. Thankfully, it only suffered a few scratches to the glass on the back.The XZ2 Premium sliding out of pockets is more common than you think. It slid out of our pocket on the subway, on a plane, at the theater, and when sitting at the office, though, fortunately, we stopped it right on time, preventing any serious injury. The point is, this phone will try to hit the floor any chance it gets, so you definitely need a case — which will only add more bulk and weight to the phone — and you need to constantly think about where you place it and how.There’s a power button on the right edge, which is a tad lower than we’d like, a volume rocker above, and a camera shutter button at the bottom. There’s no headphone jack (a USB-C adapter is in the box), but there are two front-facing stereo speakers, and a USB Type-C charging port sits at the bottom. The speakers sound good, and you can easily hear audio in noisy environments, such as outdoors.The front of the phone also packs chunky edges around the display, particularly at the top and bottom. Put the XZ2 Premium against almost every other flagship smartphone of 2018, and it will look the oldest thanks to its lack of an edge-to-edge screen. This dated, ugly look — paired with the unusual weight and thickness — does not make this phone feel like $1,000.Front design aside, we love the look of the XZ2 Premium from the back. Both the Chrome Black and Chrome Silver colors make the phone look flashy and futuristic, and the centered camera, sensor, and fingerprint scanner give off a sci-fi vibe. We do have to point out the same gripe we had with the cheaper XZ2: The fingerprint sensor is too low. We’ve put our grubby fingers on the dual-camera sensor countless times thinking it was the fingerprint sensor. You get used to it after some time, but we’d still prefer if Sony raised it next year.It is an absolute joy to watch media on this phone.The IPS LCD  5.8-inch screen supports HDR, has a 3,840 x 2,160 4K resolution, as well as a 16:9 aspect ratio. It’s fantastically sharp and colorful, and the screen truly comes to life when you play 4K HDR content like Stranger Things on Netflix. The black levels aren’t as deep as we’ve seen on many OLED screens, but it is an absolute joy to watch media on this phone. The screen also gets plenty bright for most situations, and reading the screen in broad daylight is manageable when brightness is maxed out.We did have one small issue with our unit — some colors on the screen would appear slightly muted as we swiped the notification drawer up and down. It was distracting and happened often enough for us to notice. We’ve reached out to Sony about the problem.While we love the screen and the rear design on the XZ2 Premium, the weight, thickness, and overall large body made us want to swap phones as quickly as possible.The XZ2 Premium is powered by the same processor inside its two smaller siblings — the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip — but it comes with 6GB of RAM. We had absolutely no trouble with performance on this device. Apps open instantly, moving around the operating system is fast, and games like Alto’s Odyssey and PUBG Mobile run without any issues. You’ll be able to run almost any intensive app or service on this phone.Here are a few benchmark results:The XZ2 Premium’s AnTuTu score is one of our highest, coming in right below Samsung’s Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. It reaffirms that you really don’t need to worry about performance here. One thing to note, the phone did get surprisingly warm after running these benchmark apps, but we never found it reaching a similar level of heat when playing games for a decent amount of time.The phone runs Android 8.0 Oreo, and we’ve yet to run into any of the same software bugs we saw on the XZ2 and XZ2 Compact. Our biggest issue here is just how dated the software looks compared to other Android skins, but it’s still perfectly usable.There is a good deal of bloatware, most of which you can’t uninstall but only disable, which is annoying. And there are also a handful of Sony apps such as 3D Creator, where you can create 3D images of objects or even your face. You can send it off to a 3D printer to build or simply share these images to Facebook. It’s neat, but it’s a feature we’d forget about after trying it once. There’s also Xperia Assist, which you can use to trigger several phone features based on time of day or events. For example, the Good Night action automatically turns on the blue light filter and Do Not Disturb at a time range you set. You can choose exactly what you want on or off, making it quite handy.Sony has also included the Dynamic Vibration System it debuted on the XZ2, which tries to make you “feel” videos, music, and games by making the phone vibrate during punchy parts of the audio. To us, the vibrating phone doesn’t make us feel more immersed in what we’re doing, which is why we recommend simply ignoring this feature.You likely won’t run out of space thanks to the base 64GB available, but in case you do, there’s a MicroSD card slot if you want to add more.The highlight of the Xperia XZ2 Premium is its camera, particularly with video, but let’s start with stills. The rear dual-camera system — a first for Sony — houses a 19-megapixel f/1.8 lens and a 12-megapixel monochrome lens with a f/1.6 aperture. It can capture up to 51200 ISO for photos and 12800 ISO for videos, which means it should be able to perform well in low-light conditions.In good lighting, the camera can take well-detailed photos with good color accuracy, and the camera shutter is fast to react. The only delay we’ve seen is the few seconds it takes to process the photo. While it can handle high-contrast scenarios well with HDR, it’s slow to kick in and it doesn’t always work, requiring a few attempts before you get a nice, balanced shot.In low-light environments, the camera app will say “ultra-high sensitivity” when it’s using both cameras. You can manually turn on the dual-camera system in the manual camera mode. The results are solid; photos have a respectable amount of detail and color accuracy, and while there’s quite a bit of noise, it’s not overpowering. There’s a fair chance some photos will come out blurry, which means you may have to make another attempt.But when compared with the Galaxy Note 9 — which should also deliver excellent low-light photos — the results don’t look as strong. Photos from the Note 9 tend to be more detailed, more colorful, and less grainy – an example is the photo of the Nintendo Switch, which was actually much darker than it appears in the Note 9’s photo. In the XZ2 Premium’s photo, there’s a lot of noise (ISO 8000), and details start to become fuzzy.So, while you can expect to take some solid low-light photos with the XZ2 Premium, we don’t think it can take the crown for the best low-light camera.Videos look really shaky with Sony’s phone. To truly make use of this low-light camera, a smartphone gimbal or tripod is essential.That all changes with video. Considering this is a $1,000 phone, we decided to compare the XZ2 Premium’s low-light video capabilities against two other $1,000 phones — the iPhone X and the Note 9. The results are astounding. At the park, the latter two phones produce videos that are much darker and filled with noise, but the XZ2 Premium’s video shows a ton more detail with less noise. In the videos of the dog sleeping, the XZ2 Premium’s video offers the best colors with far less noise than the other two videos, though the dog in the iPhone X’s video does appear a tad sharper.That being said, the XZ2 Premium suffers greatly from poor stabilization compared to the other two cameras. Camera shake is hardly noticeable with all the videos from the iPhone X and the Note 9, but videos look really shaky with Sony’s phone. To truly make use of this low-light camera, a smartphone gimbal or tripod is essential.Like the XZ2 Compact and the XZ2, the XZ2 Premium can also capture 4K HDR footage, but because its screen is 4K HDR, it’s one of the few phones where you can capture 4K HDR content and watch it in full glory on the same screen. Videos have beautiful and true-to-life color profiles, but we encounter the same problems with video stabilization.The camera can also capture super slow motion video at 960 frames per second in 1080p. It’s a fun feature that can produce some incredibly cool video, but it requires precise timing and lots of light for it to look good. There’s also going to be a Portrait Mode and a monochrome mode for photos coming soon in a software update, but we’ve yet to see it on our device.The 13-megapixel front camera takes selfies that are more than satisfactory, and it even uses the display as a flash so selfies look good in low light as well.For all the technology Sony packs into this dual-camera system, we can only say this phone takes the best low light videos. It’s not the best smartphone camera, and it’s not the best low-light camera — though that doesn’t mean it doesn’t take good photos. The 4K HDR option is a plus, but you can’t record with it for long, and it really does need either a tripod or a gimbal for best results.We never felt battery anxiety with the 3,540mAh battery inside the XZ2 Premium. After taking the phone off the charger at 7:30 a.m., with medium to heavy use including music streaming, gaming, web browsing, and taking pictures, we’d end up with a little under 40 percent by 8 p.m. This phone should easily get you through a day, and perhaps a little more with light use.There’s wireless charging onboard, as well as support for Quick Charge 3.0 in case you want to top up fast.The Xperia XZ2 Premium costs $1,000, and it’s available for purchase now at Amazon, Best Buy, and Focus. The phone only supports GSM networks, which means it will work on T-Mobile and AT&T, but you won’t be able to use it on Verizon or Sprint.Sony offers a standard one-year limited warranty that covers the phone from manufacturer defects, and nothing more.Sony’s Xperia XZ2 Premium impresses with its low-light capabilities, but its spotlight features cater to a niche audience, and they’re not good enough to make this phone exciting to use.Yes, in this price range, every smartphone in our best smartphones guide is up for grabs. We strongly recommend you consider the Galaxy Note 9 or Galaxy S9 Plus, as they seriously impress with low-light photography (also check out the Huawei P20 Pro if you don’t mind importing a phone).Otherwise, the Google Pixel 2 XL is our top pick. It’s more affordable, it has an excellent camera, and the best software experience you can get on an Android phone.The XZ2 Premium is wrapped in Gorilla Glass 5, and we’ve already managed to scratch it up thanks to its slippery nature. We recommend a case if you don’t want it to end up shattered. The phone is IP65/68 water- and dust-resistant, so it should be able to withstand rain and maybe a dunk in the pool.Sony has already promised an update to Android 9.0 Pie, which we expect will arrive later this year. You should expect an update to Android Q next year too. Overall, we expect this phone to last you three to four years, if not more.No, at $1,000 it’s tough to justify buying the XZ2 Premium. Unless you desperately want to film in 4K HDR or often find yourself filming in low light, this phone doesn’t do enough for its high price tag, and it’s not pleasurable to use. If you are seriously considering it still, we strongly recommend you find it at a nearby retailer and hold the phone to see if you’re comfortable with its size."
117,Sony Xperia XZ3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/sony-xperia-xz3-review/,"Sony persists with a biannual update schedule for its flagship Xperia range as it continues to play catch up in the phone market. After a radical redesign in the Xperia XZ2 earlier this year, the new Xperia XZ3 is more of a refinement. The headline feature is the 6-inch OLED screen — the first time Sony has used OLED in a phone — and it’s a solid upgrade from the 5.7-inch LCD in its predecessor. There’s also plenty of raw power, a decent camera, and all the extras you’d expect, but there are still flaws here, and at $900, Sony’s smartphone is up against some serious competition.The first thing you’ll notice about the Sony Xperia XZ3 is the 6-inch OLED screen, which looks absolutely gorgeous. It’s pleasing to look at, whether you’re reading, watching movies, or gaming. The screen is so important, you can spend hours staring at it, so we’re glad Sony has focused some effort here.It has an 18:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 2,880 x 1,440 pixels, which translates to a pixel density of 537 pixels-per-inch. Those numbers put it on a par with all the top phones from Samsung, Google, LG, and Apple. We’ve looked at it side-by-side with the iPhone X and the Galaxy S9, and Sony’s display expertise really shows in the XZ3. It’s sharper than the iPhone and more realistic than the Galaxy S9. You also have the option to tweak the display to your liking by adjusting the color gamut, contrast, and white balance.Watching 4K HDR content on this phone is a dream, and it also employs HDR upscaling and a few other tricks to enhance poorer quality video.There’s a good reason that the best phones have adopted OLED, and it’s largely because it offers a much higher contrast ratio. This is because pixels can be turned off individually, so blacks are truly black. It’s most noticeable if you use your phone in the dark. Our XZ3 review unit is black, so dark scenes see the screen disappear into the frame.The first thing you’ll notice about the Sony Xperia XZ3 is the 6-inch OLED screen, which looks absolutely gorgeous.Enhancing the Xperia XZ3’s entertainment credentials are dual front-facing speakers that offer a decent amount of oomph. The stereo speakers feature Sony’s S-Force Front Surround and we were impressed with the volume and enhanced immersion they offer. Decent Bluetooth headphones are going to be better, and there is support for High-Res Audio here, but you sadly won’t find a 3.5mm audio jack.Sony tries to further enhance the cinematic experience with its weird Dynamic Vibration feature, which prompts the device to vibrate in response to the on-screen action. We get the sense of this for gaming — it reflects the vibration in the PS4 controller which can help to draw you further into the action — but we don’t feel it works well for movies or music. We were also disappointed to find that it didn’t work for many of the games we tried. It would have been perfect to punctuate a crash in Asphalt 8, for example, but when it did actually work in Clash of Clans it didn’t really add anything useful. We think most people will end up turning it off.Sony overhauled its smartphone design with the XZ2 introducing something it calls “Ambient Flow,” which heralds a welcome embrace of smaller bezels and gentle curves. That design language continues in the XZ3, but it’s greatly refined. The bezels above and below the screen shrink just a little more.This is a supremely comfortable phone to handle despite its large size. The XZ3 is very tall at 158 mm (6.22 inches) and it’s also a lot thicker than many other phones at 9.9 mm (0.39 inches) — the iPhone XS Max, for example, is 157.5 mm (6.2 inches) tall and 7.7mm thick (0.30 inches) respectively. It’s still a good deal thinner than the XZ2 phone range. The XZ3 doesn’t feel that much bigger, because Sony has cleverly curved the screen and the glass back into the metal frame and tapered the ends slightly.We like the feel of the XZ3 in portrait or landscape, and it feels especially good when gaming, but it’s tricky to manage one-handed. It’s also very slippery — it will vibrate itself off table tops or slide out of your pocket when you sit down given the opportunity.The big negative about the design is the fingerprint sensor placement. Sony just can’t get fingerprint sensors right: First they were inexplicably deactivated in the U.S. versions of its phones, then it decided to move them from the side of the phone to the back like most other manufacturers, but Sony’s placement is much lower down. In fact, the fingerprint sensor is almost in the middle of the back of the XZ3, which makes using it one-handed feel a little precarious. To make matters worse, the camera lens is exactly where you’d expect to find the fingerprint sensor – a mistake we made frustratingly often. Admittedly, this might be a bigger problem for tech reviewers who are frequently switching phones and get used to a certain placement.This is a supremely comfortable phone to handle despite its large size.All the buttons are on the right edge. Sony has kept a dedicated camera shutter button in the perfect place at the top right when you hold the XZ3 in landscape view. Up top you’ll find a wee tray for the MicroSD card and SIM, which can be pried open with a fingernail – no SIM tool required.If we were to compare the Xperia XZ3 design to another phone, it’s probably closest to Samsung’s Galaxy line, but there’s just enough Sony style to give it its own identity.Performance is almost becoming irrelevant on the Android scene, because virtually every flagship device, even the $500 Asus Zenfone 5Z, has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 processor inside it. The Xperia XZ3 is no exception.Precisely how much RAM a smartphone needs is debatable, but Sony makes do with 4GB in the Xperia XZ3. That’s going to be enough for most people, and we didn’t run into any real issues navigating around or loading up apps, but if you consider that much cheaper phones like the Zenfone 5Z and OnePlus 6 are packing 6GB of RAM you may expect Sony to include a little more.The benchmarks make it clear how fast this phone is:Those results put in on a par with devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 and suggest that the XZ3 is a little faster than rivals like the HTC U12 Plus and LG V40 ThinQ.The only issues we had with the XZ3 were related to Sony’s software extras. Side Sense allows you to double tap on the side of the phone to access a quick menu of regularly used apps and settings that are supposed to change based on what you normally use at that time of day. We mostly triggered Side Sense by accident and often found it took a couple of attempts to trigger it deliberately. We didn’t find it all that useful, but your mileage may vary.More useful, considering the size of this phone, is the shortcut to one-handed mode, which slides everything down a bit to make it easier to reach.Sony also added a gesture shortcut that enables you to trigger the camera by holding the phone up in landscape, but we found that we triggered this by accident quite a lot too. You have to tap in the middle to fully open the camera, so it doesn’t feel like much of useful a shortcut given that you can just hold down the dedicated shutter button to launch into the camera. Thankfully, you can turn off both features if you don’t like them.We have to give Sony kudos for including the latest Android 9.0 Pie in the Xperia XZ3. Many of its competitors are releasing phones right now with Oreo and no firm timescale on updates. It offers some incremental improvements over earlier versions, and Sony’s UI is a relatively light layer on top.What we don’t like is the unnecessary addition of bloatware. Our XZ3 asked if we wanted certain apps during setup, which is a great way of offering bloatware without forcing it. Sadly, when we got through the setup process we found several other apps were already pre-installed, including Kobo Books, Facebook, Netflix, and Sony’s Album, Weather, and Xperia Lounge apps. The preinstalled apps will vary by region — in the U.S., we mostly saw Sony’s apps installed.You only get 64GB of internal storage here, though there is room for a MicroSD card.It’s a little surprising to find a single-lens 19-megapixel main camera in the Xperia XZ3. Most manufacturers are moving towards dual or even triple-lens main cameras, and Sony even adopted a dual-lens camera in the XZ2 Premium.We found the XZ3 takes good shots with plenty of detail and accurate colors when the lighting is good. In low light and indoors, you’ll see some graininess and noise creeping in, which isn’t a big surprise since the f/2.0 aperture isn’t as wide as the f/1.8 you see on other flagships. It also struggles to cope with high contrast scenarios, overexposing some areas when the environment isn’t well lit.If you’re coming from an older phone, we think the camera will satisfy, but it doesn’t match some of the other flagships in terms of low-light performance, zoom, or general versatility. The Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, the Huawei P20 Pro, the iPhone XS Max, and the Google Pixel 2 XL will all consistently outperform the Xperia XZ3.Sony’s camera hardware is widely used in the smartphone industry, but it seems to struggle with the software and tuning of that hardware. The camera app in the XZ3 is a little clunky and slow. We also found the Bokeh mode hard to use as it takes a long time to snap two shots and create a blurred background. It fails if you or your subject move too much. We actually got better bokeh results with the normal auto mode.One area where the Xperia XZ3 camera does well is video. It can capture 4K HDR footage and there’s a really fun slow-motion mode that hits 960 frames per second in Full HD. You do have to choose the right moment to trigger the slow motion, but we enjoyed the results.						The front-facing camera is also good, with a dedicated portrait mode, and a capable 13-megapixel sensor.We can’t help feeling that Sony should be able to squeeze a bigger battery into a phone this thick, but the 3,330mAh battery in the XZ3 kept us going until the end of each day. Just like almost every other phone out there, you’ll have to charge it up every night. We generally had between 20 and 30 percent left at bed time, and that’s with medium to heavy use.The fast charging is really fast, giving us 50 percent in around 30 minutes with the included charger and cable. There’s also support for Qi wireless charging, though it’s noticeably slower.The Sony Xperia XZ3 costs $900 in the U.S. or 700 British pounds in the U.K. It’s on sale now and you can buy it from Amazon.It comes with a standard one-year limited warranty for design defects or failure to operate.The Sony Xperia XZ3 is a slick smartphone with a stunning display backed by stereo speakers. It’s one of the best phones around for entertainment. We’re pleased to find the latest version of Android onboard, but Sony doesn’t add much value with its software. The battery life is average, and the camera performance lags behind other devices in this price range.If you’re a Sony fan, then this is the phone you’ve been waiting for. It will also serve you well if you primarily use your phone to watch video and play games. But if photography is one of your main priorities, then we think you should look elsewhere.Samsung’s Galaxy S9 Plus has a very similar style, a better camera, and comes in cheaper at $840. If the camera is your main thing, then the Huawei P20 Pro, also cheaper at around $800 now, is very hard to beat (though it’s not available in the U.S.). Android fans should also consider holding on for the forthcoming Google Pixel 3 XL, which will run stock Android and likely have one of the best cameras you can get.You’ll want a case for this slippery smartphone if you expect it to last. But water should be no problem: This phone scores an IP65 and IP68 rating, so it can deal with jets of water and with complete submersion for short periods of time. We expect it to get software updates for a couple of years or so and Sony has been comparatively fast of late to update its phones. We think you’ll get three years out of this phone, quite possibly longer if you’re careful.Yes. The strengths balance out the weaknesses in the XZ3, and if they align with what you want in a phone, the steep price is worth paying."
118,Vivo NEX,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/vivo-nex-s-review/,"The argument that smartphones all look the same has become slightly less convincing in 2018, with the release of visually different, exciting phones from several manufacturers. Interestingly, the cutting edge designs mostly originate in China, with the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S, the Oppo Find X, and the Vivo Nex S — the subject of our review — all turning heads this year.Unusually, we saw the Nex S as a concept device called the Apex earlier this year, but we didn’t expect the phone to go on sale so soon in almost exactly the same form. Not only did the Apex become a phone that we can all buy (kind of), but it went through some key changes that improved on the concept. We’ve been using the phone for a while, and it feels very much like the future of smartphones.Before we get started, it’s important to note the Vivo Nex S is only available in China, and eventually in select other regions. It does not have an official U.S. or U.K. release date, and while it’s possible to import the phone, our review device did not come with Google services installed, like the Google Play Store.Just look at it. The Vivo Nex S is really one of the most attractive phones we’ve seen in ages. It’s devoid of things we’re used to seeing on smartphones today — the visible fingerprint sensor and the display notch primarily. The Vivo Nex S has neither, but not at the expense of the features they enable.The 6.59-inch screen covers almost the entire front of the phone, yet its footprint is barely larger than the Google Pixel 2 XL, giving the Nex S a 91.2 percent screen-to-body ratio. There is still a slight chin. The back of the phone is smooth, uninterrupted by a fingerprint sensor, and there isn’t one on the front either. Instead it’s an in-display sensor, something Vivo has pioneered in the industry. The Vivo Nex S showcases how fantastic simple design can look, when unencumbered by sensors, cutouts, and excessive branding. It still finds space for a 3.5mm headphone jack too.The Vivo Nex S is really one of the most attractive phones we’ve seen in ages.The screen is what we’d call screen-shaped, without a notch (like on the iPhone X) blighting the straight simplicity of the top edge. The sensors are hidden, and the speaker is under the display, while the selfie camera is inside a motorized module that glides out the top of the phone. It’s the Nex’s party trick, and it simply doesn’t get old. Everyone, without fail, that we showed it to loved it. It’s fun, different, space-age, and a neat solution to a problem that currently forces the use of a notch.The 6.59-inch Super AMOLED screen has an unusual 2,316 x 1,080 pixel resolution, with a 19.3:9 aspect ratio. The bezels are tiny, with 1.71mm at each side, 2.16mm at the top, and 5.08mm on the chin. Because it’s AMOLED you get deep blacks, great contrast, and decent visibility in sunlight. It’s not very bright though, and we tended to keep the brightness at maximum without the auto assistance turned on.Flip the phone around and there are some great details. The rear panel has an intricate, laser-etched holographic design under the surface that shines in all the colors of the rainbow when it catches the light. We’re glad it’s there, because the phone is so minimalist, it runs the risk of being faceless — when the camera is hidden away — without this welcome flair. Even the antennas are hidden mostly from view.Downsides? A textured button on the left of the phone activates the onboard Vivo AI, which is all in Chinese, and we didn’t find a way to remap it. This is also a big phone, with a monstrous screen on the front. This presents a problem for those without similarly gigantic hands. Plus, the almost complete lack of bezels means the keyboard can often feel very low, and we often missed keys in the lower left or right because the phone is so large and fairly difficult to hold.It’s also difficult to tell which way is up, so when picking the Nex S up it’s often the wrong way round. It’s quite heavy at 199 grams, and the case that comes with it is made of a material that grips fabric, making it hard to get out of your pocket. We’re concerned over fragility — this is a very big, heavy, glass phone. The sticky case is a necessity.Despite some of the design downsides, the more we look at the Vivo Nex S, the more we love it.Vivo has a strong history in camera technology, but it’s arguably best known for its selfie cams. But, while the pop-up camera lens on the front is about as tricky as camera features get, the rear camera’s impressive performance has overshadowed it. How good? There have been times where we have picked up the Nex instead of the Huawei P20 Pro. The Huawei phone still has our favourite camera of 2018, but in the right situation the Nex is equally impressive.On the tech side, the Nex has dual-camera lenses on the back — one 12-megapixel, f/1.8 lens and the other a 5-megapixel f/2.4 lens. It comes with optical and electronic image stabilization, a two-tone flash, and HDR. There are plenty of modes to keep you snapping new pictures too, including a portrait mode, AR stickers, a panoramic selfie mode, and a bokeh effect on the front and rear cameras. The camera also uses Vivo’s artificial intelligence (AI) system, called Jovi (really), for scene recognition and other tweaks.The Nex S takes delightful, colorful, and visually exciting photos.Take it out in the day, especially if it’s sunny, and the Nex S takes delightful, colorful, and visually-exciting photos. It’s a joy to point it at a scene and know you’re going to get a picture you’ll love after tapping the shutter release. It excels at landscapes, blue sky, and anything brightly colored. Low light is good too, although it does tend to turn dark skies very blue. Thankfully, there’s a lot of detail in the shots to make up for it.When the AI mode activates, it does make a difference to the final image, although opinion on whether it improves the shot will be divided. It often added a relatively aggressive HDR filter-style look to shots. Sometimes we liked it, other times not so much. Dig into the settings and you can turn off the AI.What about the selfie camera and the pop-up module? First, don’t worry about the speed. It’s always up and ready to go when you need it. Second, don’t worry about the module’s strength. It’s so solid, Vivo made a promotional video with the extended camera on multiple Vivo Nex phones holding a sheet of glass up, on which a ballerina stood and danced. It doesn’t wobble about, and when you push it down it takes a degree of force to get it to automatically retract.There’s plenty for selfie fans to enjoy. The beauty mode has six degrees of aggressiveness, but we’d choose the AI mode to tone down the effect, otherwise it overexposes and turns skin very white. The AR stickers are cute additions like you’d expect to find in Instagram or Snapchat, and the panoramic mode helps take group shots. We quite liked the pictures it took, but with the beauty mode on, they’re far from realistic. The camera shutter can be slow too.Let’s talk about the Nex’s in-display fingerprint sensor. It’s in the central, lower-third of the screen and it falls easily to thumb when you pick up the phone. We registered various fingers on different occasions, and found the thumb is most convenient. It requires a light touch to operate. Press too hard, like you may on another sensor, and it won’t work. Press too lightly, and it may not “see” your finger. Once you get the feel it’s very reliable, but definitely slower than other traditional sensors.Once you get the feel it’s very reliable, but definitely slower than other traditional fingerprint sensors.Activating the double tap to wake option helped with usability, as there’s nothing to “feel” in the dark, and the graphic to show you where the fingerprint sensor is located doesn’t always appear when you want it to. It’s considerably better than the experience we had on the Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS, and therefore stands as the best in-display fingerprint sensor we’ve used yet. The Nex S does not have face recognition, leaving the in-display fingerprint sensor as your one and only security measure.The Nex S has its speaker for calls under the screen, like we’ve seen before on the Xiaomi Mi Mix. It works in the same way, sending vibrations through the display and into your ear when you hold the phone up to your head. We never heard any real difference in quality between the Nex S’s speaker and the more traditional one used on other phones.The Vivo Nex S is a high performance machine with a Snapdragon 845 processor and 8GB of RAM, which is about the best you can get at the moment. Browsing the web, using apps, sending emails, messages, and tweets are all effortless. The Vivo Nex S is a real powerhouse, and even with the less than ideal software, it didn’t slow down.Here are a few benchmark tests. We didn’t include AnTuTu, because the app wouldn’t install.These are impressive, and surpass phones like the Galaxy S9 Plus and the Pixel 2 XL. The Vivo Nex S can take anything you throw at it.We love the Nex’s futuristic design, and the camera makes it a desirable companion. Sadly, things take a downturn when we talk about the software, some of which is Vivo’s fault, and others less so. The Nex S is sold in China and our review device was supplied by Vivo. It comes with Vivo’s own Funtouch user interface over the top of Android 8.0, but it did not have any Google services installed. This makes reviewing it internationally rather challenging, as many of us rely on Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and access to the Google Play Store to get things done.Even after we installed Google’s apps, we still had to deal with Vivo’s Funtouch. Or actually, not-so-Funtouch.For this reason, we sideloaded Google’s apps and all the necessary services needed to make them work. We managed to do it, but the process was still a pain to find and load the correct apps and files. It’s not a task we’d recommend those not technically inclined to undertake. Additionally, even with everything installed, not everything worked. The Nex S would not automatically upload photos to Google Photos, for example, a task which had to be done manually. Some apps refused to install, returning error codes we’ve never seen before.Even after we installed Google’s apps, we still had to deal with Vivo’s Funtouch. Or actually, not-so-Funtouch. The Nex doesn’t have any buttons, and Vivo doesn’t want too many virtual ones messing up its clean interface either, so it has adopted an iPhone X-style swipe navigation system. It’s divided into three sections. Swipe centrally for home, on the right for back, and on the left to show a control center for brightness, Bluetooth, volume, and quick app access. Swiping down from the top still shows notifications.It’s not as polished as the iPhone X, and anyone coming from a regular Android phone will have to spend time learning its nuances. Because the phone is made for China, we’d also often get alerts and notifications from apps and services in Chinese, making the phone feel less friendly and like our own. Jovi, the Nex S’s AI assistant, is all in Chinese so we couldn’t use it. If you love to dig around and customize your phone, there is a wealth of features inside Funtouch, from a quick access shortcut that stays permanently on screen, to a split screen mode, gesture controls, and a double tap to wake.To Vivo’s credit, the phone received regular updates over the few weeks we’ve been using it, adding a few features and fixing bugs elsewhere. Coping with unfamiliar software is a part of the deal when you import a phone from China. Funtouch is fast and smooth most of the time, but it’s very different to the user experience on a Samsung, LG, or any other Android phone we can buy from a carrier. It’s also very different to stock Android on a Google Pixel or Android One phone.A 4,000mAh battery gives the Vivo Nex S strong standby times for a flagship, premium phone. We’ve had two days of regular and average use, but judging long term use is harder because power consumption has been erratic. We put this down to the software, which includes many apps with which we are unfamiliar, and may be sucking power without us knowing. In just a few hours one afternoon, we lost 30 percent battery with just a short gaming session and basic operation.The Vivo Nex has been announced for China, and it will also be released in India, Russia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Taiwan. It has not been officially announced for the U.S. or the U.K., but Vivo could eventually decide to do so. The price in China is 3,900 yuan, which converts over to around $600. It’s possible to import a Vivo Nex, with GearBest selling the phone for $710 at the time of writing. Other importers will provide a similar service and price. This also means the warranty support will vary, as it will depend on the company you decide to import the device from.The Vivo Nex S operated without a problem on a U.K. 4G LTE network, and has a wide array of bands for worldwide network compatibility. However, it’s not guaranteed to always connect to the fastest GSM signal in the U.S., so do keep this in mind if you decide to import one.A stunning technical marvel that frustrates on a software level, and annoys because we can’t easily buy one.Yes, although you’ll have to make some concessions. If you want a phone that has a pop-up selfie camera, you’re out of luck aside from the Oppo Find X, which is another import phone. If you want an in-display fingerprint sensor, the Porsche Design Huawei Mate RS is about your only other choice. Both together, it’s the Vivo Nex S or the Oppo Find X.If you want a high performance phone with a great design, and a strong camera, then the field opens up a lot more. The Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus probably comes closest to the look and ability of the Vivo Nex S, along with the Google Pixel 2 XL. You also get the same chip and amount of RAM in the OnePlus 6, and an equally slinky design. The great thing about choosing any of our best smartphone recommendations is they come with a much more familiar version of Android, and it’s the Pixel 2 range we’d recommend for the best version.The Vivo Nex S is not water resistant, is made of glass, and is quite heavy. It’s a disaster waiting to happen for the clumsy. It is incredibly well made and very solid, so we have no concerns over the device itself not lasting the course of normal ownership. Vivo has also been good at delivering software updates, but we don’t expect that to include an upgrade from Android 8.1 to Android P in a timely manner. It’s just not that important in China, where the phone is likely to sell in large numbers.No. Unless you live in China, the software experience will frustrate compared to more readily available Android smartphones. This is a disappointment, because the rest of the phone is great, and even the price is competitive considering the cutting-edge technology inside. However, if you’re comfortable installing Google Play Services on import phones, and don’t mind messing around with a phone in this manner, you’ll be the envy of many with the Vivo Nex S in your hand."
119,Xiaomi Mi 8,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-mi-8-pro-review/,"What better way for Xiaomi to announce its entrance into the U.K. than with the Mi 8 Pro, a great-looking smartphone with powerful specifications. This is no half-hearted entrance. The Chinese company also has a wide variety of other devices and connected products it will sell online, as well as in a flagship store located at a busy London shopping center. Plus it has struck a deal with the Three network too. Xiaomi has arrived, and it means business.However, it’s not going to have an easy ride, due to some very strong competition. However, Xiaomi has priced the phone so aggressively, we’re going to assume its next target must be winning the UFC world title. It’s just 500 British pounds, or about $650, putting it up against the OnePlus 6T, the Samsung Galaxy A9, and the Honor 10.It’s simply impossible to avoid the fact the Mi 8 Pro looks like an iPhone XS. The front has a notched screen and the back has an offset, vertically mounted, dual-lens camera with the flash in the center. It’s an unashamed facsimile, saved only by the transparent rear panel. This is a stroke of genius, as it looks fantastic. No, those aren’t the actual components powering the phone, but they are real transistors and chips. It’s a neat effect, but it’s just not accurate to say these are the parts keeping the phone running.The smoked glass looks fantastic, especially as it gradually gets darker around the curved edges, giving real form, depth, and style to the device. It fits in the hand wonderfully, and it’s not heavy either. The screen is flat, and has a notch at the top, a chin at the bottom, and black bezels at the side of the display. It’s reminiscent of the iPhone XR.The Mi 8 Pro looks stunning, even it it is derivative.Despite the 6.21-inch screen, the Mi 8 Pro is surprisingly manageable, and it’s slim and lightweight. There’s no fingerprint sensor on the rear, as it has been placed under the phone’s display. This is becoming more commonplace, with the OnePlus 6T and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro both offering the feature. They all work in the same way — you put your finger or thumb over the right spot to unlock the phone. Sadly, they are also all similarly unreliable.The Mi 8 Pro’s in-display fingerprint sensor isn’t any worse than the others, but it’s no better either. In the few days we’ve been using it, we’ve re-registered our print several times to try and improve reliability. A single press is more often than not all it takes to unlock the phone now, but it still takes longer to do so than a traditional print. Unlike the OnePlus 6T and Mate 20 Pro, the Mi 8 Pro does not have the face unlock feature found on the closely related Mi 8 Explorer Edition active yet. It’ll come in a future software update, for some reason.Fingerprint issues aside, the Mi 8 Pro looks stunning, even it it is derivative. Sadly though, if you’re looking for a headphone jack, you aren’t going to find one, and that hasn’t sealed the phone up enough to gain any water resistance either.The Mi 8 Pro has a 6.21-inch OLED panel with a 2,248 x 1,080 pixel resolution, an 18.7:9 aspect ratio, and a notch at the top. Xiaomi has several display modes, and hidden under the settings is the option to adjust the contrast. We found when it was set to automatic, the screen would wash out every so slightly. Turn it to Increased Contrast, and the difference was remarkable. Videos are alive, games pop off the screen, and colors become so electric we can’t stop watching. It’s a real stunner.Inside this phone is a Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM, which is a seriously powerful combination. We ran some benchmarks to see how it performs:We have played a selection of games, used the phone for messaging, emails, and social networking, and found no performance problems at all. This is a fast phone, and it can easily take on the competition. The benchmark results put it somewhere close to the performance offered by the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and the LG G7 ThinQ; but behind the incredibly well-performing OnePlus 6T (which shares the same specs).Xiaomi’s a great believer in reusing technology throughout its range, and the Mi 8 Pro has the same dual-lens 12-megapixel camera on the back as we saw on the Mi 8. The main lens has an f/1.8 aperture, and the secondary lens has an f/2.4 aperture, plus optical image stabilization, and a 1.4-micron pixel size. It shoots portrait mode pictures with a bokeh effect, plus Xiaomi’s artificial intelligence powers scene recognition and selfie beauty modes.The photos are hit and miss. There’s no question it has the ability to take great shots, but we do question the software’s ability to capture those shots each and every time. We haven’t spent much time with the camera, but the images we have taken fall into two camps: Perfectly good or almost unusable.When the camera performs well, the colors pop (although they are slightly oversaturated), and there’s some lovely detail. Plus the 2x hybrid zoom is effective. We have seen problems focusing in both portrait mode and with the selfie camera, which is also blighted by image blur with the beauty modes active and excessive noise in difficult lighting conditions.We’re going to test the camera more, and will additionally look out for software updates that may improve this. We are using one of the very first Mi 8 Pro devices, and therefore it may not be exactly representative of the final version.It’s Android onboard the Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro, but with Xiaomi’s own MIUI user interface over the top. It’s version 9.6 of MIUI Global, meaning it has Google Play and all the usual apps and features we’d expect from an Android phone. We like the look of MIUI. It’s clean, the icons are well-designed, the menus aren’t frustrating, and it’s frequently updated. However, there are some annoyances that stop us wanting to use it — not least the notifications on the Mi 8 Pro.There is space either side of the notch, yet none of it is enabled for notifications.There is space either side of the notch, yet none of it is enabled for notifications. Worse, the lock screen does not show incoming notifications either. Pull down the notification shade and everything is there. App icons all show numbers indicating the amount of notifications waiting, but we miss the other options. There are some workarounds, but they’re not user friendly at all — for example each app may need to be individually enabled to show lock screen notifications. Why this is the case is baffling.Otherwise, MIUI didn’t pose any compatibility problems, and aside from an extensive collection of Xiaomi app tools — everything from a link to Xiaomi’s forum to a compass and a screen recording app is pre-installed — the bloat is minimal. A pleasant user experience marred by notification annoyances, and the camera app problems described above.The ability for the Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro to take on the OnePlus 6T, and the various other competitors out there, depended on price. At 500 British pounds, it’s an absolute bargain, despite its shortcomings. It’s 30 pounds cheaper than the equivalent OnePlus 6T, which makes it incredibly tempting.The phone is solid with some strong plus points — the beautiful screen, the eye-catching transparent back, and great performance — but the software frustrates, the battery has only lasted us a day with average use so far, and the onboard speaker is poor.There’s a great, probably excellent, phone waiting to be unleashed here. It has the right price, and now needs a decent software update to deliver on its promise."
120,Xiaomi Mi A2,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-mi-a2-review/,"There was a time when many would not have paid attention to a phone running Android One. It was reserved for those who wanted to buy their first smartphone, often in places where high-end models cost the equivalent of many months salary. Things changed recently, and Xiaomi’s Mi A1 2017 smartphone helped lead the way for Android One phones to become desirable for those who could still afford to pay more. The Mi A2 is Xiaomi’s sequel to the Mi A1, and it does everything better than before, without ramping up the price to exorbitant levels.Can the Mi A2 provide a Google Pixel 2-like experience for a third of the price? Let’s take a closer look.The Xiaomi Mi A2 is based on the Xiaomi Mi 6X, and it’s hard to ignore the vertically-stacked camera lenses on the back that make it resemble the iPhone X. This aside, it’s very similar to the Mi A1, with a fingerprint sensor in the top center and antenna bands wrapped around the top and bottom of the body. Things change around the front, as the Mi A2 has a 5.99-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio screen, with a 2,160 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It looks considerably more modern than the Mi A1.Xiaomi has taken care with the shape of the body. It’s very slim at a little over 7mm, with sleek curves around the edge, making it wonderfully comfortable in the hand. It’s a real pleasure to hold. It feels so good, it makes the ordinary, untextured volume and power buttons feel a little basic and cheap in comparison. The camera lens does extend out of the body quite dramatically, and unless the phone is in a case, it will connect first with whatever it’s rested on, risking scratches.It’s very slim with sleek curves around the edge, making it wonderfully comfortable in the hand.The Mi A2 is available in a pinkish gold color, a blue, as well as a matte black option. The gold catches the eye due to the white bezel around the screen, although we do like the stealth-style look of the black version. We haven’t seen the blue up close, but it may turn out to be our favorite when we do. The Mi A2 is a great looking phone. The metal body feels solid and well built; and it’s so pleasant to hold, we didn’t want to put it down.The rear camera has a 12-megapixel main lens and a 20-megapixel secondary lens, which is also used around the front as the selfie cam. Xiaomi said the camera uses “pixel binning” technology for impressive low-light shots. By using the 20-megapixel sensor only in these situations, it turns four pixels into one to increase the amount of usable light. Then with some software magic, it converts the resulting 5-megapixel image into a final photo with 20 megapixels. The same process is repeated on the selfie camera too.We’ve not had the chance to try this out yet, but it sounds a little like LG’s Bright Mode on the G7 ThinQ. Taking a few early images with the camera in daylight produced some beautiful, colorful, and shareable photos. In bright, slightly overcast conditions, it did struggle to balance the sky and clouds with the rest of the environment, but it’s not terrible. We spent some time taking photos of flowers and bees, with several coming out well indeed, revealing plenty of detail and color.The selfie camera comes with Xiaomi’s updated beauty mode, which has been tuned to recognize and enhance more faces, regardless of complexion and other factors. The portrait mode on the front and back cameras works well, and we had fun playing with the built-in live tilt shift mode. In our early phase of testing, we think the camera on the Mi A2 may be a strong selling point.Xiaomi has boosted the processing power over the Mi A1 using the Snapdragon 660 inside the Mi A2 with 4GB of RAM on the 64GB version. A 6GB RAM/128GB model will also be available, but it may not be sold everywhere the standard 4GB/64GB model is released. Because the Mi A2 has Android One installed, it’s fast, smooth, and a joy to navigate. The model we tested has Android 8.1.0 installed, with the June 2018 security patch, and updates will continue to come on a regular, timely basis.Simplicity, elegance, and usability of Android One.Android One has no downsides, and outside of the camera app, a file manager, and an AirDrop-style sharing app, Xiaomi has left it alone. While Xiaomi’s MIUI is one of the best third-party user interfaces out there, it cannot compete with the simplicity, elegance, and usability of Android One.We have not put the phone through any benchmarking tests, or played games yet, but we did notice the body quickly got hot after using the camera for a while. Not to the point where you couldn’t hold it, but definitely so that it could be felt in a pocket.The phone we used is an early release unit, and it may receive software updates to optimize the system. Additionally, while the screen is fine indoors, it does struggle a little in strong sunlight — even with the brightness turned up to maximum.The Xiaomi Mi A2 costs 280 euros, or about $330, a little more than the 250 euro Mi A1. Almost every aspect of the phone has been improved, making the slight cost increase acceptable, especially for a phone of this quality. The Xiaomi Mi A2 has been announced for the company’s official European markets — including Spain, Italy, and France — but it will also be available internationally as an import. We have tested the phone in the U.K. where it received a 4G LTE signal without a problem on the Three network. However, this may not be the case in the U.S., and non-compatible bandwidths may stop it operating on 4G LTE through the AT&T or T-Mobile GSM networks. We’ll update when we know more.It’s impossible not to hold and use the Xiaomi Mi A2 without thinking, “why doesn’t everyone buy one of these?” The software is just so effortlessly good, the camera takes pictures we like, and the device is attractive and comfortable to use. All for a third of how much many flagships cost. If you don’t think you really need a high-end phone, but still want a phone that’s capable yet suitably different to others, then the Xiaomi Mi A2 is worth investigating further.

121,Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s-review/,"As prices for flagship smartphones have climbed in the last couple of years and improvements have been relatively modest, it feels like we’re suffering from diminishing returns. Manufacturers have placed more emphasis on design, but the two dominant forces in the market — Apple and Samsung — are also charging a premium for their top-tier phones.Xiaomi’s Mi Mix 2S is a gorgeous flagship that can go toe-to-toe with the best in terms of high-end specs and stunning beauty, while costing significantly less (around $600). The problem? You will have to import it, because there’s no official U.S. availability yet. So, should you consider it? We took it for a spin to find out.Let’s not beat about the bush — this is one of the best-looking phones we’ve ever handled. The black ceramic back curves into the aluminum frame. There’s a dual camera module at the top left, with a glint of gold around it and a recessed fingerprint sensor, which doesn’t double as a button. We could live without the “Mi Mix designed by Xiaomi” slogan in gold lettering, but the Chinese manufacturer is clearly proud of this design.While countless Android lemmings embrace the notch, Xiaomi has been pursuing a bezel-less design from a different angle for a couple of years now. The original Mi Mix was one of the first phones to aggressively shrink those bezels down and it still has one of the highest screen-to-body ratios you’ll find. The Mi Mix 2S continues the tradition, though it’s not quite as all-screen as its predecessor.We’re told the notch is the answer to the tricky problem of where to put the front-facing camera and other sensors, but Xiaomi has chosen to put it at the bottom right corner below the screen. While we don’t tend to snap a lot of selfies, this placement is actually a lot less awkward than you might imagine. More on that when we dig into the camera.On the right edge, you’ll find the power button with a volume rocker above it. The SIM tray and MicroSD card slot are on the left. The bottom edge is home to a USB-C port and the mono speaker, but you won’t find a 3.5mm audio jack anywhere.Let’s not beat about the bush — this is one of the best-looking phones we’ve ever handled.It feels reassuringly hefty in hand (it weighs 191 grams), which adds to the impression of quality. It’s a phone we enjoyed handling and one that draws admiring glances and questions when you slip it out of your pocket.As gorgeous as the ceramic body is, you should be prepared for finger smudges galore. We also frequently woke the touch-sensitive fingerprint sensor, sparking a vibration every time we put the phone away or pulled it out.This is not going to be an especially durable phone, though we were relieved to find that an accidental drop onto stone only scuffed the corner of the metal frame. Most phones nowadays are glass, so the need for a case is standard. Where the Mi Mix 2S does drop some points is its lack of water resistance, which is something we’ve come to expect in a flagship phone.Minor gripes aside, we love the look and feel of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S — it is positively dripping with class.The 6-inch (5.99 if we’re being pedantic) display covers most of the front of the Mi Mix 2S. The thinnest of bezels separates it from the top and sides, and there’s a larger bezel at the bottom.We’re a little disappointed to find that it’s an IPS LCD screen with a resolution of 2,160 x 1,080 pixels. It sports the modern 18:9 aspect ratio that has become standard over the last year, but it’s lackluster. Next to a Galaxy S7 Edge, which is more than two years old, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S is dull and lacks the same razor sharpness.We’re convinced OLED is the way forward, but even in the LCD world this isn’t one of the best displays around. The pixel density isn’t a big problem — text is perfectly readable and movies and games look fine – it just isn’t especially bright or vibrant.Xiaomi certainly hasn’t cut any corners in the processor stakes. The Mi Mix 2S has the latest Snapdragon 845 processor from Qualcomm, backed up by 6GB of RAM with 64GB or 128GB of storage, or a whopping 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage like our review unit.Performance is fast and silky smooth as you’d expect. We played PUBG: Mobile on maximum settings, Super Mario Run, Star Wars Commander, and a few other games without any issues. It did get warm while playing PUBG: Mobile, but that’s not unusual.The benchmark results are equally impressive:Two of those results are slightly better than the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus managed, though it got a far higher 3DMark score. Benchmarks alone never tell the whole story, but this is certainly a speedy phone.Performance is fast and silky smooth as you’d expect.Unfortunately, despite the fast performance, we did encounter some strange issues with the Mi Mix 2S. Both Twitter and Chrome crashed more than once, something that has never happened to us with previous phones we’ve tested.Xiaomi has applied its own MIUI on top of Android 8.0 Oreo and by default it wants you to sign up for a Mi Account and use Xiaomi’s cloud services, which are optimized for life in China. We prefer Google, and thankfully you can install all your usual favorites, but you can’t set up Google Pay or other contactless payment services.There’s nothing wrong with MIUI, but it takes some getting used to as you navigate unfamiliar menus. But there are some real oddities – why have a watermark on every photo? Luckily, you can dig into the camera settings and turn this off. There’s also no app drawer, but you can always install a different Android launcher if you don’t get along with MIUI.The odd quirks, such as spelling mistakes in pop up messages, reinforces the fact that this is a phone made for the Chinese market first. Although Xiaomi has been making noises about breaking into the U.S. market for years now, it hasn’t happened yet. Looking at the recent troubles Huawei and ZTE have run into, we can’t see it happening any time soon.You’ll find a dual rear camera in the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S pairing two 12-megapixel sensors. The main one has an f/1.8 aperture, while the secondary lens has an f/2.4 aperture. In good lighting the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S captures some great shots with plenty of detail and colors that are vibrant without veering into unrealistic. If you’re snapping your friends and family, or stunning landscapes, we think this camera will serve you well.It doesn’t manage quite as well with close-up shots. You really must take time to focus where you want. This isn’t the fastest camera around to load, change modes, or shoot a photo.When light is mixed or more limited, we found the camera results a bit disappointing. It can’t match the low-light performance of phones like the Pixel 2 XL or the Galaxy S9 Plus. Noise and graininess creeps in quite quickly and it doesn’t cope at all well with contrast between light and dark areas in the same photo.The dual lens combination allows you to snap portrait photos with a pleasing bokeh effect, where your subject is in sharp relief and the background is blurred.We shot a few different portraits and were pleased with the results. The subject is generally in focus with some slight blurring around the edges, especially with hair, but that’s par for the course. The only odd result we got was with Bodhi the cat – if you look at the left edge you’ll see it has decided to blur the whole side there.When light is mixed or more limited we found the camera results a bit disappointing.We’re told that there are AI smarts in the Mi Mix 2S camera, but it doesn’t show its workings like the floating word salad you get with LG’s G7 ThinQ, so it’s hard to know what it’s doing.The front-facing 5-megapixel camera is entirely average. It will be fine for most people, but selfie addicts should look at another phone. The bottom right placement never bothered us – the first time you use it you’re prompted to turn the phone upside down, but it adjusts and works well whatever way you hold it and, as long as you remember to look into the lens, the results are fine.While the camera is mostly good, it’s not in the same ballpark as the big boys. Phones like the Huawei P20 Pro, Pixel 2, and iPhone X are significantly better for photography.There’s a sizable battery in the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S, rated at 3,400mAh. We found that the phone lasted a normal day with some change, but you’ll likely need to charge it every night. Light use might stretch it to a day and a half or maybe two. When we played a lot of games and used the camera extensively it died on us in the early evening.We expected a little better from this capacity, especially since the display isn’t particularly high resolution or bright. We’re pleased to find support for Qi wireless charging, though. There’s also support for Quick Charge 3.0 via the USB-C port, for when you’re in a hurry.Looking at a direct conversion from the Chinese price, you should be able to buy the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S for a little over $500, but when we had a look at online stores like Gearbest and Honorbuy it starts from around $625.If you want the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S you will have to import. It’s not going to get an official U.S. release, so it will never be in your local carrier store. Be careful where you buy to avoid import duties or problems with returns if something should go wrong. You should also check what bands the model you’re looking to buy supports to ensure it will work with your carrier’s network.The warranty will depend on where you buy. Most online stores offer a limited one-year warranty for defects.The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S is beautifully-crafted, powerful smartphone with a decent camera, but it does come with strings attached. Most people simply won’t be willing to import the phone from China, so we don’t expect to see many of them around.Is there a better alternative?Yes, there are lots of better phones on the market. The Pixel 2, the Galaxy S9, and the Huawei P20 Pro are all better, but they’re also more expensive. If you’re not married to Android, then the iPhone X or 8 Plus are also better, but again, they’re much pricier.If you only have around $600 to spend, then we recommend waiting for the OnePlus 6. It will be much easier to buy in the U.S., and it only costs $530.How long will it last?You could certainly expect to get two years out of the Mi Mix 2S, but you should definitely get a case for it. In the past Xiaomi hasn’t always continued to update Android for more than a year or so, even though it does continue to update MIUI for longer, and that’s something worth considering.Should you buy it?Yes, if your budget is limited and you love the design, the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S is a very classy phone. For the money we think it’s a compelling prospect."
122,Xiaomi Mi MIX 3,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-review/,"The Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is a highly-capable phone that’s all screen with slim bezels around the massive 6.4-inch screen. No notch, no hole-punch, and at first glance, no front-facing selfie camera. What’s its secret? A slider mechanism that reveals the dual-lens front camera when you slide the screen down. It’s a wonderful piece of eye-catching technology that solves the all-screen problem facing most manufacturers today.Except I’m going to tell you not to buy it, even though it’s excellent, with very few downsides. What’s the problem? The Mi Mix 3 is a stark reminder of how fast the mobile industry moves. It’s barely a few months old, but has already been overshadowed by a subsequent Xiaomi phone release, the announcement of an incoming 5G Xiaomi Mi Mix 3, while also facing serious competition from the rest of the market.The Mi Mix 3 is the latest in the Xiaomi Mix family, which was the first to introduce the concept of an all-screen phone to the world. The original Mi Mix phone felt incredibly futuristic at the time, while the Mi Mix 3 feels … less so. It’s mainly because we have become more used to smartphones with bezel-less screens, and have already had fun with the slider mechanism on the Honor Magic 2. Don’t take this to mean the Mi Mix 3 is boring though. It’s definitely not.Without a notch, the Mi Mix 3 has a massive 93.4-percent screen-to-body ratio, and the screen looks stunning. It’s a 6.4-inch AMOLED with a 2,340 x 1,080 resolution. It’s monstrously bright, has an almost faultless contrast level, and vivid colors that keep our eyes glued to the screen. It was easy to use the display tuning mode to get the look just right too. The night mode and reading modes have made it comfortable to use before bed, and video looks great from Netflix and YouTube.The phone itself is heavy though, at 218 grams, and it’s weighted oddly — likely due to the slider. At 8.4mm, it’s thick by modern standards. Combine this with the slippery body, and you’ll realize just how much you need to hold onto the Mi Mix 3.The glossy, reflective ceramic rear panel gets smudgy quickly, but it’s so beautiful when it’s clean that I can forgive it. Ceramic is warmer to the touch than glass, provides more scratch protection, and has a wonderful, deep glossy shine that’s irresistible. There is a simple plastic case included in the box. It looks and feels cheap compared to the phone though, but it will offer basic protection.The Mi Mix 3 is a stark reminder of how fast the mobile industry moves.Unlike many other high-end phones around at the moment, the Mi Mix 3 has a fingerprint sensor on the back, not in the screen. This is a double-edged sword. One the one hand it’s more reliable and natural to use, but on the other it doesn’t look as modern or high-tech as some of its competitors. The Mi Mix 3 also has face unlock, but to activate this you must slide the slider down to show the camera lenses your face, which can be annoying to do every time you want to unlock the phone.While we like the all-screen look of the Mi Mix 3, it’s the slider that will split opinion. The mechanism is stiff enough that it doesn’t flop open, and it needs effort to spring. There is a satisfying click from the magnets inside when you do, but the real joy comes from snapping it shut. Xiaomi has engineered the magnetic “ridge” — the point it passes before closing — and the “snap” — where it comes to a stop — perfectly. However, for all the geeky fun, it’s not always easy to open with one hand.It’s built really well though, doesn’t wobble around, and only introduces a very slight “springiness” when pressing the screen down to slide it open. It does add in an extra step to take selfies, or use face unlock. That said, we like the way it can be customized, either to take a selfie or to open an alternative app, plus there are various sounds to accompany the motion. We like Warrior, which sounds like unsheathing a sword. It’s fun, and there’s often not enough of that in modern phones.The Mi Mix 3 may not have the same eye-widening, future-shock effect the original Mi Mix did, but it’s infinitely more usable and less fragile, all while boasting a wonderfully-built modern design.Xiaomi has put a Snapdragon 845 with 6GB of RAM inside the Mi Mix 3, and we have not experienced any performance issues. It plays games well — the viewing experience when playing is also excellent — and the Android 9.0 Pie software with MIUI 10.2 over the top is smooth, fast, and mostly bug-free.The Mi Mix 3 is a brilliant audio device, especially when you use the Mi Sound Enhancer.There are some annoyances with the software, especially around notifications which don’t always show on the lock screen, endlessly repeat, or simply show the wrong amount on the icon. We like being able to interact with them through the notifications shade though.If you’re worried about trying MIUI due to fears over it being very different to other Android experiences, don’t be. It’s one of the cleanest, simplest to adapt to user interfaces available. MIUI 10 is a distinct improvement over previous versions, with a decent gesture control system, minimalist icon designs, Google Assistant, and a slick design. It’s not confusing either, once you get used to the layout of the Settings menu, which differs from other Android devices. Google Assistant is really quick to respond to voice commands, and we’ve found it often wakes more quickly than other devices or even the Google Home.Benchmark tests show how the Mi Mix 3 compares to other smartphones:These are strong scores, often equaling or beating the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition, and the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Note 9. You won’t have any complaints with the speed or performance of the Mi Mix 3, but it can’t match the Galaxy S10’s astonishing figures. Just remember that it’s using the Snapdragon 845, a chip that has been superseded by the Snapdragon 855, if owning the very best available right now matters to you.There are four camera lenses on the Mi Mix 3 — a 24-megapixel, f/1.8 aperture main lens and a 2-megapixel depth lens on the front under the slider. On the back is a dual-lens 12-megapixel setup, with the main lens again having an f/1.8 aperture plus optical image stabilization, autofocus, HDR, various artificial intelligence modes, a 2x zoom, and a Night mode. The selfie camera takes portrait-style bokeh shots — both stills and video — and has an extensive artificial intelligence-driven beauty mode.Xiaomi has taken the rear camera from the Mi 8 for use on the Mi Mix 3, but the experience has been better on the Mi Mix 3, which we put down to more mature software and some tweaks over the last months. Daytime photos on sunny days look superb, with bright colors popping off the screen, sharp detail, and sensible contrast levels. They are not overly saturated, although don’t quite have the natural look you’d get from the iPhone XS.Night mode isn’t useful during the day, unlike Huawei’s version, but does enhance low-light shots in darkness. In street photos using Night mode, street lights are less blown out, there’s more detail than without it, and colors are better realized. However, some shots have a strange halo-effect where light areas meet darkness. It’s distracting, and makes the photos look less realistic.Bokeh mode on the rear camera is decent, but can fail to recognize some objects. It’s better at recognizing human shapes though. For selfies, the Mi Mix 3’s portrait mode is better, and edge detection impresses. Side-on shots usually fail to understand the edge of my glasses shouldn’t be blurred out, but the Mi Mix 3 captures them more effectively. The beauty mode is as subtle or as aggressive as you like, and there are plenty of adjustments to be made if you want them. There’s also a bokeh mode for video using the front camera, but it’s only moderately successful, with the edge detection not being accurate enough to make the video look its best.The camera app has a comprehensive editing suite with image adjustments, cropping, filters, and some more unusual tools like an eraser. There is a similar editor for video as well, with filters, a trim tool, and some artificially intelligent-driven effects too. This is worth noting, as many other camera apps ignore video editing tools. It’s all very easy to use, with sensibly-placed buttons to toggle the features, and a simple scrolling menu system to change modes. The Mi Mix 3’s camera is excellent, creatively fun, and simple to use.Don’t be disappointed by the Mi Mix 3’s 3,200mAh battery, even if on paper it’s smaller than many of its peers. It’s a strong performer, returning easily a day’s worth of heavy use. It won’t stretch into a full second day, but with moderate use it’d likely make 24 total hours. A YouTube video ran for 10 hours and 45 minutes on a full charge, at 1080p and maximum brightness. That’s around the same time as the Samsung Galaxy S10 in the same test.We like the Mi Mix 3 a lot, but it’s worth waiting for the alternatives.It’s charged using a USB Type-C cable with Quick Charge 4.0, or a 10-watt wireless charger, which is included in the box. The cable charge is fast, and using the included charger, the battery was full in an hour and 20 minutes.There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack on the Mi Mix 3, so you either need Bluetooth headphones or a dongle. Listening to Spotify using a dongle and a pair of OnePlus Bullets revealed the Mi Mix 3 to be a brilliant audio device, especially when you use the Mi Sound Enhancer setting. This has different equalizer settings for various Mi headphones, but the General mode is suitable for all, and makes a genuine difference — from a wider soundstage to enhanced bass and stronger vocals.The phone has plenty of volume too, though the external speaker is disappointing. Apart from easily being blocked just by holding the phone, it doesn’t have much finesse.This is a Xiaomi phone which means it’s not available to buy in the U.S., although you can purchase an import model if you’re really keen. It’s sold officially in the U.K. through Xiaomi’s online store and its retail partners sell it for 500 British pounds, which works out to around $660. The Mi Mix 3 has a two year warranty in the U.K., and is available to buy now.The Mi Mix 3 is an excellent smartphone, with a striking design, a good camera, and plenty of power. Except you shouldn’t buy it. The reason isn’t to do with the phone, which has very few downsides, but everything to do with the other phones you can buy now or in the very near future.Here’s where I explain why you shouldn’t buy the Mi Mix 3. Right away, if you’re set on a high-end Xiaomi phone, we recommend you by the new Mi 9 instead. It has a 500 euro price, which means it will likely cost a little less in the U.K. and therefore less than the Mi Mix 3, it has the new Snapdragon 855 processor, and a triple-lens camera too. It’s a better purchase than the Mi Mix 3 at the moment, when you consider longevity.On that same subject, the other thing to remember is the 5G Mi Mix 3 will be released in May. It will come with a Snapdragon 855 processor and 10GB of RAM, and cost 600 euros or about $680. If you’re really taken with the design and slide-up camera on the Mi Mix 3, it is worth waiting for the updated version for real future-proofing. Xiaomi is to blame for making the desirable Mi Mix 3 less desirable in a very short space of time.It has serious competition from other brands too. The Honor View 20 looks fantastic, has a brilliant camera, plenty of power, and costs around 500 pounds/$660. The OnePlus 6T may be getting old (by OnePlus’ standards) but it’s still a strong purchase at $550, plus the OnePlus 7 will be here before we know it too. The Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018) costs 550 pounds, and the new Nokia 9 PureView is 600 pounds, or $700. You could buy any of these and not look back.The ceramic body will resist scratches, but not harsh drops, and the all-screen front won’t enjoy any sharp impacts either. However, the slider mechanism should be good for 300,000 open and close cycles according to Xiaomi, and in JerryRigEverything’s durability test, it performed well with the minimum of flex. We certainly haven’t had any concerns. It feels rock solid, and never once feared it breaking during our time with the phone. You won’t want to get the Mi Mix 3 near water or too much dust though. It does not have an IP rating due to the slider mechanism.This is a flagship phone, and the modern design will keep it looking fresh for some time, but the processor has since been updated by Qualcomm, and there will be a lot of more powerful phones out over the coming months. It’s not going to be considered out of date for several years though, so buy with confidence, if you can’t resist.No. Ridiculously, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3. The problem is the Mi 9 is technically more capable, and will therefore be a better long-term purchase. Additionally, the looming 5G version is only a few months away, and will relegate the standard Mi Mix 3 to the sidelines in terms of longevity once again. We like the Mi Mix 3 a lot, but it’s worth waiting for the alternatives at the moment."
123,Xiaomi Pocophone F1,Digital Trends,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cell-phone-reviews/pocophone-f1-by-xiaomi-review/,"Rarely do smartphone reviews require much context ahead of talking about the device, but the Pocophone F1 is a phone that warrants a proper introduction. The name itself should be a giveaway as to why, because unless you’re plugged into the international smartphone world, this new brand may not sound familiar.Pocophone’s partner in all this is Xiaomi, a name more will know. Xiaomi provides its manufacturing and software expertise, the benefits of scale — which includes buying power and industry connections — and years of experience. Pocophone isn’t Honor to Xiaomi’s Huawei, as it follows completely its own design and promotional path; but the F1 and presumably future Pocophone devices will be available almost everywhere Xiaomi phones are. That includes parts of Europe, and potentially, the U.K. and the U.S. in the future.You’ll want the Pocophone to go on sale near you: It’s shockingly good, and all for an almost unbelievably low price. There are several companies out there that should be looking nervously back at Pocophone, and here’s why.Xiaomi’s involvement isn’t a secret. The Pocophone’s box and case both say, “Pocophone by Xiaomi,” in case there was any confusion over the famous Chinese brand’s input. The phone will also be sold in India, where confusingly it’ll be known as Poco by Xiaomi. There will be a blue, black, and a red model sold, along with a special edition with a Kevlar rear cover, like the one you see in the pictures.The phone’s body is made from polycarbonate, just like Nokia’s Windows Phone devices, and although it doesn’t feel very premium, it is hard wearing, protective, and low cost. This also means there are no visible antenna lines on the body. While the red color looks excellent, the Kevlar is a lot more attractive. It’s real Kevlar too, and the the weave shows through nicely. Two vertically-stacked camera lenses are set above a fingerprint sensor, and red flashes surround the lenses for some visual flair. Take a look at the top of the phone and you’ll see a 3.5mm headphone jack.Pocophone’s partner in all this is Xiaomi.This isn’t a slim phone at 8.8mm thick, but through some clever design tweaks — comfortably rounded sides, and the screen sitting slightly proud of the body — it doesn’t feel large in the hand. The IPS LCD screen measures 6.18-inches and it’s in a compact body, so it’s only slightly larger than the iPhone X.The Pocophone F1 isn’t a stunner, but it’s far from being visually offensive. It’s mild-mannered, and definitely reminds us of early OnePlus efforts, such as the OnePlus 2. This won’t be the first time we bring up OnePlus either.The 6.18-inch LCD screen has a 2,246 x 1,080 pixel resolution, with a sizeable chin, small side bezels, and a notch at the top. We asked Pocophone’s head of product, Jai Mani, about this as the notch is quite large and noticeable. It’s a business decision, as it is the type of screen that’s easily available in the supply chain right now. In reality, it actually makes the phone look more modern, more so than it would with a standard aspect ratio and large bezels around the screen.Sadly, the notch isn’t that functional, as it’s not only very wide, but also quite deep, so any arguments that it gives “more screen real estate,” are rendered pointless. Dig into the software and the notch can be hidden, and we actually prefer the look of the Pocophone’s screen without it active.Display performance is adequate. The screen gets covered in fingerprints and related mess, dulling the viewing experience; but Mani confirmed to Digital Trends there is an oleophobic coating over the Gorilla Glass 3 screen. Additionally, when watching YouTube videos there is a bluish tint compared to other phones, and it does lack a little in detail when compared with phones from Honor, which also offer great performance for a reasonable price. The overall quality of the F1’s suggests it was another cost-saving area for Pocophone. It’s not bad, just not as good as you’d expect from a high-price flagship. The F1 isn’t such a phone, which is why it still gets a pass here.Expecting the Pocophone F1 to have a mid-range Qualcomm processor and a handful of RAM? Think again, this is a high performance smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 and 6GB of RAM. That’s the same chip and RAM configuration used in many flagship phones that cost between $500 and $1,000. The F1 does not cost that.It’s still early days at Pocophone, which makes glitches more likely, but not less annoying.The F1 is, well, F1-car fast. Fast for gaming — we played Reckless Racing 3 and Riptide GP2 with the graphics maxed out without issue — and fast for multitasking. Simply, if you want a phone with the fastest processor available now, and probably more RAM than many of the computers you’ve owned in the past, the Pocophone F1 will do the job.We tried to run some benchmarks to see how it performs, but two of our usual three benchmarking apps — Geekbench 4 and 3DMark — refused to run on the F1.This AnTuTu score is higher than the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus, close to the OnePlus 6, and one step away from the 273,00 scored by the Galaxy Note 9. Don’t worry about performance on this phone.The big chip is not the only thing the F1 shares with high-end phones including the new Galaxy Note 9. It’s also water-cooled, with a pipe running along the device’s spine to help keep the processor cool. By lowering the temperature, the device runs more efficiently, and the battery keeps going for longer too. The F1 did not get hot during benchmarking and gaming sessions.We have been impressed by the F1’s speed and smoothness, factors that are crucial to making the phone enjoyable to live with and use each day. However, there are some inconsistencies and slight disappointments between our test phone and the official spec sheet. Bluetooth AptX HD is listed as a feature, but this did not seem to activate, or appear as an option. Also, the infrared scanner in the notch isn’t active yet, with secure face unlocking coming later with a software update. It’s still early days at Pocophone, which makes glitches more likely, but not less annoying.The camera is perhaps even more important than device performance, and one of the main reasons we choose one phone over another. The Pocophone F1 borrows the main camera from Xiaomi’s Mi 8 and the Mi Mix 2S, meaning it’s a 12-megapixel sensor with dual-pixel autofocus, and is paired here with a second 5-megapixel sensor.The results are startling, thanks in part to an effective artificial intelligence mode. Shooting on a slightly overcast day in London, the F1 made great use of the available sunlight, and the AI applied sensible scene enhancements when needed. During the changing of the Guard in Whitehall, the F1 captured a great photo of the stone buildings, clouds, and London scenery. We also love the shine on the horse’s coats as the parade passed by.The dual-lens setup enables portrait mode shots, and we were really impressed with some of the results. In St. James’s Park, we got close to the ducks and took several photos using portrait mode. These were taken quickly, often in positions where it was difficult to see the screen, yet the camera sorted everything out and returned some really great photos. All the camera technology is supplied by Xiaomi, including the app, and the experience shines through. Edges are picked out effectively, and the blur is subtle for a pleasing composition.All the camera technology is supplied by Xiaomi, including the app, and the experience shines through.A software-driven portrait mode is also included on the 20-megapixel front camera, along with a beauty mode. The blur effect is very strong, and like most software bokeh systems, it’s confused by glasses and lots of hair. We like the various live filters though, including black-and-white mode. The beauty mode can be turned off if you don’t like it too. The front camera also has a Super Pixel system that combines four pixels into one, for better low-light selfies. We haven’t seen this make much of a difference yet, but will continue testing.F1 photos can look quite processed, which instantly makes them suitable for sharing online, without the need to add filters. If you do want to play with the results, the app has a comprehensive editing mode.We’ve really enjoyed taking photos with the F1, and haven’t stopped even though that part of the review process is complete — high praise indeed.A massive 4,000mAh battery lives inside the Pocophone F1, which has happily returned two days of general use — that’s photos, social media, gaming, and web browsing — before needing a recharge. When that time comes, although the device supports Quick Charge 3.0, the included charger will take the best part of three hours to take the battery from almost flat to full.The F1 has Android 8.1 installed with Xiaomi’s MIUI Global version 9.6 user interface installed. That means Google Play and all the associated apps are all present, making it easy to use anywhere in the world. Xiaomi’s MIUI is a well-established Android-based operating system, and it’s one of the better versions available. There are millions of satisfied users, after all.We like MIUI because of its clean design, but anyone used to Android on a Pixel will be frustrated by the amount of extras that come installed, ranging from Xiaomi’s own web browser, an optimization app, a system cleaner app, a QR code reader and business card scanner, and a screen recorder app too. That’s along with a file manager, a dialer, a download app, and a contacts app. Xiaomi’s own apps cannot be uninstalled.The F1 is, well, F1-car fast.Sadly, our F1 had one rather annoying issue that definitely ruined our experience, and not one we’ve seen with MIUI before. Notifications did not always appear on the lock screen, and icons did not appear at all in the notification bar on the home screen. Pull down the notification shade and they’re all there, but this doesn’t help much. Notifications will be upgraded to a MIUI 10 notification system in a small software update after launch.Despite this, MIUI is pleasingly fast, and if you don’t like the look, it’s ready to have any theme you want applied over the top. Pocophone needs to fix the notifications though.Available in India only from August 29, at least at the moment, the Pocophone F1 starts at about $300 for the 6GB/64GB model. The 6GB/128GB version costs about $340, and the 8GB/256GB version is approximately $400. The Armored Edition with the Kevlar back panel is $430. Next stop for the Pocophone F1 is Hong Kong, Indonesia, and France according to the company. The intention is to sell the F1 everywhere Xiaomi phones are currently available.It’ll be possible to import the phone if you live outside one of those places, and provided you select the “global” version, it will come with Google Play, and MIUI will be in English. However, the modem bands may not operate with your chosen carrier, especially in the U.S.. In the U.K., where we tested the Pocophone F1, it happily connected to O2’s 4G LTE network.The Pocophone is impossible to ignore, due to a spec sheet that practically defies belief given the $400-or-less price; but it’s still early days for the company, which means putting up with a few glitches and features not working.Let’s list the sub-$400 smartphones with a Snapdragon 845 first. There, that didn’t take long, because there aren’t any. The Pocophone F1, for this reason alone, stands out as being astonishing value for money. To get an identical hardware specification, the minimum you’ll spend is $530 for the OnePlus 6. After that, the sky is the limit, all the way up to the $1,000 Galaxy Note 9.What you’re abandoning is what we’d call premium design and materials. The Pocophone is plastic, not glass, and the design is simple. Neither of these things are bad, but they are one of the reasons we pay more for high-end phones. The camera performed well in our tests, but it’s not only up against the OnePlus 6, but phones like the 400 British pound Honor 10 too, both of which are excellent value for money.The Motorola G6 and the Nokia 7 Plus would also be considerations when you’re spending this amount of money. The Pocophone F1 gives you more performance, more technology, and a bigger battery. It’s very hard to ignore these benefits.The Pocophone F1 is not a rugged phone, nor does it have water resistance; but the polycarbonate body will definitely be harder wearing than one made of glass. The weight makes it feel sturdy, and Xiaomi’s manufacturing expertise is immediately obvious in the great build quality. A simple silicone case is included in the box, which is a nice addition. Treat it sensibly by not getting it wet, and the phone should be a faithful companion.Software is a little harder to judge. Xiaomi is good at delivering its own software updates on a relatively regular basis. It is also a Google partner, and Pocophone has said Android 9.0 Pie will arrive in the near future. Also, in the first month of release, a stable version of MIUI 10 will be available too. What’s more, MIUI is highly flexible, and Xiaomi will update the software dependent on the phone and its capability, rather than ignoring older phones entirely.No, it won’t have the same guarantee of the immediate software updates you’d get from buying a Google Pixel 2 XL, but it won’t be left to fend for itself over time either.If you plan on using the Pocophone F1 in the U.S., then no, because it may not operate properly on your carrier’s 4G LTE network. If you live where the Pocophone is officially sold, then yes, even with the glitches we have experienced, it’s too much of a bargain to pass by."
