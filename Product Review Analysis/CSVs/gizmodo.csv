0,Pixel 6,https://gizmodo.com/the-pixel-6-is-so-good-why-buy-anything-else-1847927331,"Google’s previous Pixels relied too heavily on fancy software to make up for having fewer cameras, smaller batteries, or older processors. But between its custom Tensor chip, updated components, and a slick new design combined with even smarter software, Google has capitalized on the Pixel’s potential at last. And with a starting price of just $599, for people thinking about buying a new phone this year (especially those already familiar with Android), the Pixel 6 is so good you have to seriously ask yourself: Why buy anything else?Google has never been shy about breaking from tradition when it comes to smartphone design, and with the Pixel 6, the company has done it again. Instead of the boxy camera modules you see on the backs of so many phones, Google has opted for what it calls a Camera Bar, which plays right into the phone’s form and function. On the Pixel 6, Google uses the camera bar as a playful accent to the Pixel 6's tri-tone design, while also making it so that the Pixel 6 sits flat on a table, which is one of my long-simmering pet peeves about the move toward giant camera modules.But the biggest change is just how premium the Pixel 6 feels compared to the Pixel 5, with a Gorilla Glass Victus panel in front, Gorilla Glass 6 in back, and an IP 68 rating for dust and water resistance to protect you from life’s dunks and dips. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have their own identities: The standard Pixel 6 has a more down-to-earth matte finish around its edges (which I frankly prefer), while the Pixel 6 Pro gets polished metal sides for a slightly more luxurious look.Both phones are definitely on the large side. The Pixel 6 features a 2400 x 1080 6.4-inch display with a 90Hz screen and the Pixel 6 Pro a 3120 x 1440 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz screen,  which is a potential bummer for people who prefer a smaller device.Then again, with how great the Pixel 6's screens look, it’s hard to blame Google for going big. Both phones put out excellent brightness north of 750 nits, with deep rich colors thanks to their AMOLED displays, and the super smooth viewing experience that so many people have come to love from screens with higher refresh rates.My only quibble with the Pixel 6's design is that these phones are so big and tall, I  wish Google had positioned their power buttons below the volume rocker so it’s easier to reach. I don’t know about you, but I lock and unlock my phone more often than I adjust the volume. I also noticed that depending on the content, the Pixel 6's stereo speakers can sound a bit hollow, but it’s rather minor.And while I love the convenience of having an in-screen fingerprint reader (especially when masks are still required in so many places), the speed at which the Pixel 6 recognizes my digits feels closer to the first-gen in-screen sensor Samsung used on the Galaxy S10, as opposed to the speedier version Samsung featured in this year’s Galaxy S21. It’s not a huge deal, and once you get used to it, it’s not  something you think about during normal use. But it could be faster.It really can’t be understated how important Google’s Tensor chip is, because not only does it represent Google taking control of chip development for its phones, it also allows the company to ensure the Pixel 6's performance will deliver the best results. Google says benchmark numbers aren’t everything, and with the Pixel 6, I can see why. On synthetic tests of overall system performance like Geekbench 5, the Pixel posted scores of around 2,700 for multicore performance compared to around 3,600 for phones with Snapdragon 888 chips like the S21. The Pixel 6 seems to lag behind. However, on graphics tests like 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme Unlimited, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro’s scores of around 8,600 were basically dead even with the S21 Ultra’s mark of 8,594.But more importantly, Google’s Tensor chips provide more powerful neural processing, which makes the Pixel 6 faster and more power-efficient when performing AI and machine learning functions. That’s Google’s bread and butter. According to Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh, this makes it possible for the Pixel 6 to do things it simply couldn’t do before using an off-the-shelf mobile chip, especially when it comes to running more accurate voice models on-device. There’s no need to call down for help from the cloud, which increases power efficiency even further (more on that later), and it also ensures there’s less chance Google or anyone might be privy to sensitive information.Even without the most impressive benchmark numbers, both the Pixel 6 (with 8GB of RAM and 128 of base storage) and Pixel 6 Pro (12GB of RAM and 128GB of base storage) still boot apps and multitask as well as any Android phones on the market (aside from true big-screen behemoths like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3). The only people who I can think of who might have issues with this kind of performance are hardcore mobile gamers, and for them, there are phones like the Asus ROG Phone 5.Note: The $599 unlocked Pixel 6 from the Google Store does not support mmWave 5G, but the carrier variants at AT&T and Verizon do. And with all three carriers offering deals where they’re basically giving the Pixel 6 away when you trade in your current device, there isn’t much of a premium on mmWave 5G if you’re trying to make sure you can get peak cellular speeds.With the introduction of Google’s Tensor chip, it honestly feels like the floodgates have opened when it comes to how Google will leverage that added AI and ML performance. The number of clever new software tricks in the Pixel 6 is actually kind of jaw-dropping. Thanks to Material You in Android 12, making your phone’s entire interface match your wallpaper is as easy a tapping a single toggle. You can turn on Google’s slick minimalist app icons by enabling the Theme Icons settings in the Pixel 6's wallpaper menu. But that’s just the start.First, there’s Google Calling Assistant, which is useful for folks who hate dealing with automated phone agents when calling a big company’s customer support. For the top 5,000 businesses in the U.S, Google Calling Assistant not only tells you when wait times are short, it will  help you navigate those arcane touch-tone phone menus with an onscreen UI, and then sit on hold so you don’t have to, before pinging you when a customer service agent actually jumps on the line.There’s also a new Google Assistant-powered Voice Typing feature that you can activate in Gboard by saying “Hey Google, type,” so you can dictate your texts (including emojis) instead of tapping or swiping them out one word at a time. And if the Assistant ever gets it wrong, you can edit your text in real-time by typing, use commands like “Clear” or “Stop” whenever you want, or just say “Send” when you’re done.The Pixel 6 is also borrowing a trick from Google’s Nest Hubs and smart displays with the ability to answer or decline calls, or stop and snooze alarms just by saying the word—no need to say “Hey, Google” first. With the power of Tensor, Google is able to use higher quality voice models across various apps, which makes my favorite Pixel app, the Recorder App (which now supports German and Japanese), even better. And while the Pixel 6's speech recognition isn’t perfect, all of these features work as good or even better than you expect, and it’s kind of magical.But for me, the feature that really hits home is the Pixel 6's Live Translate feature, which works in several ways. You can turn on Live Captions to translate audio and video in real-time, or use Interpreter Mode or Google Lens in the camera app to translate to help you get out of a jam while traveling. But my favorite is the new Live Translate feature for messaging, which works across a bunch of messaging apps (Google Chat, Android Messages, Snapchat, Signal, Line, Twitter, FB Messenger, and more) in 11 different languages (English, French, Japanese, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Hindi, Polish, Russian).As a half-Asian person with Taiwanese roots on my Mom’s side, I feel like a louse for never becoming fluent in Chinese (I spent a year and a half learning Mandarin overseas in Taiwan, but came back to the U.S. before getting a complete grasp on the language). This has made it challenging to stay in touch with a lot of my extended family over there, but now thanks to some help from a resourceful AI, my language gap suddenly feels a lot less daunting.Google isn’t truly fluent in Chinese either (it incorrectly translated the character for pomelo to grapefruit), but sometimes a little help is all you need to reinvigorate your efforts. I’m a bit sad that only Simplified Mandarin is supported for now and not Traditional Mandarin, because the latter is the Chinese of choice in Taiwan, and it’s where Google has a number of major offices and thousands of employees.Unsurprisingly, Google is leveraging the power of software and hardware for the Pixel 6's cameras. Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro come with the same 50-megapixel main cam and 12-MP ultra-wide cam, while the Pixel 6 Pro features a bonus telephoto cam with a 4x optical zoom, making it the first Pixel to ever sport both a telephoto and an ultra-wide lens.It might seem wild that Google is just now reaching this milestone when phones from Apple and Samsung have had both for years, but it really drives home the point that the Pixel 6 is the beginning of Google’s hardware push. And after waiting all this time to see it happen, the results are worth it.Everything from photos taken in bright light to low-light Night Sight shots look clear and crisp, with the Pixel 6 routinely capturing more fine details than any of its competition. In a shot of a lonely tree, not only did the Pixel 6 Pro do a better job of capturing the colors and the veins on the tree’s leaves, it captured deeper and more accurate greens on the surrounding grass. Then, in another shot down an alley, the Pixel 6 Pro really impressed with a photo that showed off the phone’s dynamic range while the iPhone 13 Pro’s pic left the leaves and parts of the sky looking almost neon. Even in a shot as mundane as a bed of flowers, the Pixel 6 Pro did a better job of tamping down over-saturation, which continues to be one of the ongoing weaknesses of Samsung’s cameras.And in low light, it’s not even really a contest, as Google’s Night Sight continues to best all comers when trying to take pics in the dark. I’m really not sure why iPhones still don’t have a dedicated low-light mode, but they definitely need one, as evidenced by a nighttime cityscape where the Pixel 6 Pro captured a sharper, more colorful pic without suffering nearly as much from the presence of unwanted lens flare.The Pixel 6 Pro’s 4x optical zoom stacked up quite favorably to Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra at 4x, which is just lovely for people like me who constantly long for more reach from smartphone cameras. However, while that reach can be extended up to 20x thanks to Google’s Super Res Zoom tech, compared to the S21 Ultra’s 10x optical zoom, Samsung is still keeping the crown for the best zoom on a phone. The Pixel 6 Pro’s telephoto is good, but Samsung’s is better.But Google also packed in some incredibly fun new camera features, like Magic Eraser, Face Unblur, Action Pan, and Long Exposure modes. While Magic Eraser isn’t quite as powerful as Adobe’s Content Aware Fill or even the Magic Stamp tool, it’s much easier to use and does a good enough job for social media. The same goes for Face Unblur, which is a godsend for parents trying to take photos of their kids. Now it won’t rescue a bad picture, but I’ve been testing it out on my 2-month-old son (who I won’t post pictures of here for privacy’s sake), and it really does make it much easier to capture sharp pics of kids who just can’t stay still.However, the award for the most fun new camera feature is a tie between Action Pan and Long Exposure, which distills camera techniques that typically take hours if not days or weeks of practice to learn (not to mention a fair amount of gear) into one-tap wonders. With Action Pan, a typical shot of car suddenly looks like a screen cap out of Forza Horizon. I used Action Pan to capture another scene on an NYC ferry, and the Pixel 6 made an everyday image a whole lot more exciting. When was the last time you saw a ferry go zoom?Meanwhile, Long Exposure allows the Pixel 6 to completely change the tone of a scene. A normal shot over water can become a tranquil facade, with smooth, glassy rivers and waterfalls that you’d never see without this technique. Now you could do better with a fancy mirrorless cam, a tripod, and editing software, sure. But you’d never be able to do it this fast or easy, and when it comes to smartphone photography, that’s exactly what I want. And with the Pixel 6 now having the ability to recoding video in HDR, the colors in your clips shimmer and pop more now too. When it comes to battery life, I’m not sure what’s more impressive: the Pixel 6's daily performance, or its score on our video rundown test. In the real world, both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro routinely had 30% to 40% battery left in the tank at the end of the day, and that often included the time I spent testing various features over and over again. No doubt Google’s Tensor chip plays a big part in the Pixel 6's energy efficiency, which is critical as people start to really take advantage of the phone’s various AI and machine learning-powered features more often.On our battery test, the standard Pixel 6 posted an outstanding time of 18 hours and 56 minutes, which is the second best time we’ve seen from any phone this year, right behind the iPhone 13 Pro Max (19:30). And while the Pixel 6 Pro wasn’t quite as impressive, lasting 16:45, it tied the Galaxy S21 Ultra while handily beating the OnePlus 9 Pro (13:54), and others.Battery life isn’t the only power upgrade the Pixel 6 got. Google also upped its charging speeds to 30 watts when wired charging (just make sure you have a 30-watt USB-PD 3.0 power adapter), or up to 21 to 23 watts (depending on the model) when charging wirelessly with Google’s forthcoming second-gen Pixel Stand. And even if you don’t have a first-party Google wireless charger, you still get 12-watt wireless charging, which ain’t bad. If you’re ever out and one of your other devices with wireless charging is running low, the Pixel 6 even has reverse wireless charging, so you can share some of your phone’s excess juice with a device in need.These days, managing your digital security can feel downright overwhelming. But one of the best things about the Pixel 6 is that with its new Titan M2 coprocessor and its new Security Hub, Google makes it easy to shore up any holes—both on your device and online. In the security hub, you’ll get notifications if Google detects that one of your passwords may have been compromised, tips on how you can further improve your security, and even a general score to see how good (or bad) you’re doing.Google is now even committing to five years of security updates for the Pixel 6 (which is now the longest among all Android phones) plus three years of OS upgrades, so the Pixel 6 should be easy to hold onto for longer without worry or fear of FOMO. And for those not accustomed to dealing with scams and phishing attacks, the Pixel 6 will even warn you if someone sends you a message asking for your password. Pro tip: Don’t ever hand your password over. Any major company worth their salt should have multiple ways of verifying who you are without you needing to send your password in plain text.When I had a chance to get an early look at the Pixel 6 back in August, my big takeaway was that this is the most confidence I’ve seen from Google about any Pixel to date. And after testing out the Pixel 6, it’s not hard to see why. More than any Google device before, the Pixel 6 demonstrates the power and potential of machine learning and ambient computing. There really is much more to performance than big numbers, but to make it happen, you need clever software and sophisticated hardware optimized to make those apps and features shine. The Pixel 6 totally delivers.If all you care about is getting the best phone for your money, the Pixel 6 is it. It’s a flagship through and through. Its good looks won’t be confused with any other phone (the cases are rather fetching, too), it offers a new take on smartphone performance, improved security, and the best cameras you can get on a phone today. And once again, the Pixel 6 starts at just $599, $200 less than an iPhone 13 or Galaxy S21. And the Pixel 6 Pro is basically a more affordable S21 Ultra without built-in stylus support and way better software. Honestly, what’s not to like? If you’re looking for the best phone for the money, there’s no reason to buy anything else."
1,TCL 20pro,https://gizmodo.com/the-tcl-20-pro-5g-is-the-most-underappreciated-phone-fo-1847769430,"Try as it might, TCL is having a hard time expanding its presence outside of TVs, despite owning notable phone brands like Alcatel, Blackberry, and Palm. It’s tough to be a major player in a smartphone market dominated by Apple and Samsung. Even LG got out of the game. But TCL is still trying, and for the second year in a row, the company has made one of the most underappreciated smartphones on the market. The TCL 20 Pro 5G is that good.The TCL 20 Pro immediately impresses with a gorgeous build featuring a big 6.67-inch curved display, a brushed metal frame, and matte glass in back—with a few nice flourishes like flush rear cameras and bonus Smart Key on the left that can be customized to open apps or things like the phone’s flashlight. And while some people might accuse the TCL 20 Pro of having the same basic shape and design as some of Samsung’s past Galaxy phones (notably the S10 and S20), TCL has still made enough tweaks and changes to give the 20 Pro its own identity. Also, I’d be remiss not to mention that the blue 20 Pro is downright stunning, though if you’d rather not attract attention, the phone is also available in dark gray.But what impresses me the most aside from its design is the range of extra features TCL has included on the 20 Pro. Not only do you get a microSD card slot and a headphone jack, you also get wireless charging (something you rarely see on a $500 phone), a fast in-screen fingerprint sensor, and even an IR blaster, which is a feature that has been dropped by practically every other phone maker. You get an IP52 rating for dust and water resistance, which isn’t much, but should be enough to guard against a random spill or two.Honestly, the only other feature I wish TCL had included is stereo speakers. Instead, all you get is a rather shallow but still relatively loud mono speaker on the bottom of the phone, which feels even worse when you realize that the 20 Pro has a tiny earpiece above its screen that TCL may have been able to repurpose to help provide a richer stereo sound experience. Ah, well, no phone is perfect.With TCL’s expertise when it comes to TVs, it’s not a big surprise to see its phone pack great a display for the money, too. Topping out at nearly 700 nits, the 20 Pro’s 2400 x 1080 6.67-inch AMOLED screen is plenty bright and pumps out rich, vivid colors. And for those who love to watch videos on their phones, TCL also includes its NXTVISON 2.0 tech, which provides improved color accuracy, support for HDR10, and the ability to optimize colors and tones to best suit your content. Quite frankly, the TCL 20 Pro’s screen might be the best mobile display outside of more expensive flagship handsets.And when it comes to performance, while 6GB of base RAM and a Snapdragon 750G 5G chip aren’t super impressive, they’re still more than enough to handle all sorts of apps and games without much fuss (or lag). TCL even includes 256GB of onboard storage—which is twice as much as what you get from a standard iPhone 13—so even if you aren’t a fan of microSD cards, you should have plenty of room for photos, apps, and more.Arranged in a neat little row, the TCL 20 Pro’s camera array includes a high-res 32-megapixel selfie cam, 48-MP main cam, 16-MP ultra-wide cam, 2-MP macro cam, and a 2-MP depth cam for helping out with portrait effects. I prefer telephoto cams to macro cams when it comes to everyday use, but on a mid-range phone like this, not having a real zoom is much more forgivable. But more importantly, the 20 Pro’s image quality is pretty solid, especially in bright light where the 20 Pro captured images with sharp focus and bright colors. Even in a head-to-head shootout with the Pixel 5 (which has the same cameras as  the Pixel 5a), the TCL 20 Pro was able to keep up during daytime shots. In fact, in one shot of a mural in NYC, I actually preferred the 20 Pro’s photo over the Pixel 5's pic, because even though the Pixel 5 did a better job of preserving shadows and details, I found that without editing, the Pixel’s darker exposure just wasn’t as pleasing or eye-catching as the 20 Pro’s photo.However, TCL definitely still has work to do when processing low-light images. The 20 Pro’s pics were routinely, darker, and grainier—both with and without the phone’s night mode turned on. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a total disaster, but I found I had to consciously try harder to keep my hands still while snapping pics at night, lest I get a bunch of blurry, streaky photos. And with the 20 Pro often producing underexposed images at night, I found myself relying on its night mode more often as well.While the TCL 20 Pro 5G has 5G in its name, your actual 5G connectivity will vary a bit depending on your carrier. First off, the 20 Pro doesn’t support mmWave 5G, so don’t expect any of those super fast gigabit speeds you might see on more expensive phones in ideal conditions. And while carriers are expected to add  new C-band spectrum to their 5G networks later this year, the TCL 20 Pro won’t support those 5G frequencies either. That means the TCL 20 Pro is best for T-Mobile customers, where you can expect wide sub-6Ghz 5G connectivity, with slightly spottier support for those on AT&T or Verizon.Featuring a 4,500 mah battery, the TCL 20 Pro lasted a respectable 14 hours and 27 minutes on our video rundown test. That’s actually slightly longer than the iPhone 13 Mini (13:42) and an hour and a half longer than Samsung’s Galaxy A52 5G (12:53), but still way shorter than its biggest rival, the Pixel 5a, which lasted an extremely impressive 18:18. That’s fine when you remember the Pixel 5a doesn’t support wireless charging, and the 20 Pro does.For $500, the TCL 20 Pro 5G has more features and extras than basically any other phone in its price range, with a premium design that looks great. And with its big, rounded-edged AMOLED screen, the TCL 20 Pro looks and feels like a budget Galaxy S20, and I mean that in the best way possible. However, when it comes to mid-range phones, I still prefer the $450 Pixel 5a. It offers a lower starting price, better cameras, Google’s excellent Pixel-specific software, and the company’s commitment to three years of updates and security patches compared to just two for TCL. That said, the TCL 20 Pro is still more than a worthy rival, and for people who want something just a bit fancier without forking over a lot of extra money, TCL’s mid-range phone is a great alternate pick."
2,iPhone 13,https://gizmodo.com/iphone-13-review-just-get-the-pro-instead-1847749252,"Last year’s iPhone 12 was a meaningful upgrade from the iPhone 11 and felt more premium than its $799 price tag. I was less sold on the $699 iPhone 12 Mini, which was a perfectly sized phone for those of us with small hands, but it had tragic battery life made worse by 5G connectivity. With the iPhone 13, Apple has significantly improved the Mini’s battery life, but now that the Pro lineup has elevated what a flagship iPhone is capable of, the iPhone 13 feels like the most incremental of upgrades. If it weren’t for the battery gains, which are huge compared to the iPhone 12, let alone the 8, X, XS, and 11, I’d recommend sitting this one out.But the battery life really is that good.Let’s get right down to it. The biggest change Apple made in this year’s more affordable iPhones is perhaps one that’s most essential for every single iPhone user: battery life. Last year’s iPhone 12 delivered a solid amount of life on a charge—14 hours and 20 minutes on Gizmodo’s video rundown test—but the 12 Mini’s small size translated to a small battery. The Mini lasted just 11 hours and 20 minutes on our test, a full three hours less than the 12, and often needed to be charged by early evening. Not being able to last an entire day is a cardinal sin for a smartphone, and Apple took that criticism to heart.The 13 and 13 Mini have bigger batteries, and that absolutely makes a difference. The 13 lasted almost 17 hours on our battery test, and the 13 Mini turned in a respectable 13 hours and 42 minutes—almost 2.5 hours longer than last year’s Mini. This is a big deal because it means you don’t have to tote around a charger or a battery pack as punishment for choosing a small phone.The iPhone 13 Pro’s battery life is on par with the 13's, but the 13 Pro Max blows all of the other new iPhones away. Anecdotally, the Pro Max lasted 2.5 days on a charge, and 19 hours and 30 minutes on our battery test. It’s a beast. But it’s also too large for most human beings to use comfortably and that’s that.The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini, like the 12 and 12 Mini, have two rear 12-megapixel camera lenses: one standard (or what Apple calls wide), and one ultra-wide with a 120-degree field of view. The 13 Pro and Pro Max have an extra 12-MP telephoto lens capable of shooting up to 3x optical zoom. The 13 and 13 Mini have a digital zoom of up to 5x for photos and 3x for videos. The 13 and 13 Mini’s camera modules are much larger than the 12 and 12 Mini, with noticeably bigger lenses. Apple has beefed up the main cam with a larger sensor that the company says can take in 47% more light, while the ultra-wide-angle lens also has a new sensor that Apple says reduces noise in low-light photos. All the iPhone 13 models have sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which basically works to combat the inevitable shake in your hands when shooting photos or video so you get crisper shots. Last year, this feature was reserved for the 12 Pro Max.I traipsed up to Griffith Observatory to capture downtown Los Angeles on a foggy night to do some camera comparisons, taking an iPhone 12 Pro Max with last year’s best camera, a 3-year-old iPhone XS, and Google’s Pixel 5, which has long set the standard for excellent low-light shots (although both Samsung and Apple have become competitive in the last year). As you can see below, the 12 Pro Max still turned in a solid shot, but its main lens lets in less light than the 13's. The XS lacks any kind of night mode, which is obvious. Google’s Pixel 5 still has a capable Night Sight mode. I decided to test out the iPhone 13, 12, 11, and XS side by side in low-light conditions. Apple still sells both the iPhone 12 (now $599) and iPhone 11 (now $499) alongside the new iPhone 13 lineup. For reference, the 13 and 12 both support Night Mode in both lenses. The 11's main lens enables Night Mode, but its ultra-wide-angle lens does not. The XS has a standard cam and a telephoto lens, but it lacks Night Mode altogether. You can compare their shots below.The iPhone 13 clearly has a better main lens than the 12 (and 11 and XS), with its Night Mode shots even besting the 12 Pro Max. But where things fall apart a bit is with the ultra-wide-angle lens. While the 13 has a slight edge when it comes to more natural color reproduction than the 12, I wouldn’t call the 13's ultra-wide-angle lens good. More on that in a minute.Back to the iPhone 13's main lens, which handles bright daylight well, even when shooting directly into the sun. The brewery scene below shows the light-dappled ground and has just a hint of the green light iPhones usually have from lens refraction. But the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s aggressive scene optimization works to its favor here—the left side of the image is more well-lit than the iPhone’s. The Pixel 5's backlit scene is completely blown out, though the effect is unintentionally kind of cool. The 13 is definitely more capable than the XS.When it comes to optimal shooting conditions—late afternoon light outside—the iPhone 13 excels. In the golf course photo below, the putting green stands in vivid contrast to the deep green trees and red flag, and the wisps of clouds are stark against the bright blue sky. Compared to the Pixel 5's shot, which is overall duller, from the colors to the details, the iPhone 13's image is perfect. But the iPhone has always performed well outside in daylight.In addition to low-light improvements, the iPhone 13 shares a few features with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, including Photographic Styles (a smart version of filters that can’t be reversed after the fact) and cinematic video mode, which is like portrait mode for video. I wrote about these in-depth in my 13 Pro and Pro Max review—Photographic Styles are fine but unnecessary, and cinematic video is fun but finicky—and the same applies to the 13 and 13 Mini.But after spending a week shooting with the iPhone 13, I’m a little disappointed. The main lens is excellent at both daytime and nighttime shots, but you don’t get much bang for your buck with the ultra-wide lens. Don’t get me wrong: Ultra-wide is great for dramatic landscape shots or making a short person look like they have gazelle-like supermodel legs. (Try this, it works.) But I found myself longing for a telephoto lens more often than not—digital zoom just doesn’t cut it. If the iPhone 13 had a dual-lens set-up with a telephoto and main cam that both supported Night Mode, sort of like an iPhone XS meets iPhone 13 Pro, that would be it: the perfect iPhone. But as it stands, the iPhone 13 Pro is the more well-rounded camera system capable of a wider variety of great shots, while the 13's upgrades are too incremental.The 6.1-inch iPhone 13 and 5.4-inch 13 Mini look almost identical to their predecessors, minus two small tweaks. The first is a slightly smaller notch—20% smaller, Apple says—which is thinner at the sides but protrudes down a smidge more than on past notched iPhones. This change is negligible, and I’m not actually sure why Apple did it. Until the notch goes away completely, the notch is fine. We’re all used to it.The second change is on the back of the iPhones, where the dual lenses are now arranged diagonally. This seems to be related to the sensor-shift OIS mechanism, which appears to take up a chunk of the camera module. It’s also a visual indicator to the rest of the world that you have a new iPhone, so there’s that. The lenses themselves are bigger than last year’s, and the square module is also larger. Other than that, the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini retain the same flat-edged design as last year, with a shiny fingerprint magnet of a glass back that comes in five colors: red, white, black, blue, pink, and a new color called “starlight,” which is silver and gold combined. I tested the black Mini (yawn) and the pink iPhone 13, which is a lovely pale pink. The new iPhones have color-matched aluminum frames, just like they did last year.The OLED display is slightly brighter than last year’s, but the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini screens don’t get the 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that the 13 Pro and Pro Max do, so scrolling isn’t as smooth.Every year, iPhones get faster, and this year’s iPhones are the fastest iPhones ever. This is not surprising. The new A15 Bionic chip has a 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU that beats every other smartphone chip out there by a wide margin. You can multitask, play games, and never have to worry about a sluggish phone. The same was true last year, but this year, even faster.On Geekbench 5's Compute Metal benchmark of graphics performance, the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini’s scores were leagues beyond way more expensive Android flagships (Mini: 10877; Samsung’s $1,800 Galaxy Z Fold 3: 4684). As expected, the 13 and 13 Mini’s synthetic benchmark scores were also more impressive than last year’s iPhone 12 and 12 Mini, which ran on Apple’s A14 Bionic processor. The A15 Bionic and iOS 15 also contribute battery optimizations on both the hardware and software levels to increase the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini’s battery life, which is helpful.I’m not sure anyone would notice a meaningful difference between the A15 Bionic and A14 Bionic in real world use, unlike how they would with, say, a 120Hz screen. But they’re fast iPhones. That’s good. The 13 and 13 Mini undeniably have compelling price tags for flagship phones. I’m curious to see whether Google’s Pixel 6, built on Google’s custom processor, can rival the iPhone 13 when it comes to price, performance, and photography features when it debuts later this fall. If you’re not an Android person and simply want to know which iPhone to buy, I don’t have a one-size-fits-all recommendation here. Whether you should upgrade to an iPhone 13 or 13 Mini depends on a few factors: Last year, the iPhone 12 seemed like a steal. You got basically all of the Pro models’ features—fresh design, 5G connectivity, MagSafe charging, an OLED display—without spending $1,000. This year, the calculus is a little different. The 13 and 13 Mini’s battery gains are meaningful, but the new camera features are light and the ultra-wide-angle lens is just not as useful as a telephoto one. The 13 Pro adds some features you can’t get on the 13 or 13 Mini, and you no longer have to splurge on the overly large Pro Max to get the best cameras on an iPhone.Rumor has it this year’s Mini will be the last, so if you love a pint-sized phone, follow your heart. Otherwise, go Pro."
3,iPhone 13 pro,https://gizmodo.com/the-new-iphone-is-better-than-the-old-iphones-1847749247,"For much of my smartphone-owning adulthood, I was an iPhone “S” year upgrader, due almost entirely to my relationship with my cell carrier. My first iPhone was a 3GS, which I got for peanuts with my Cingular contract. (Yes, Cingular.) I was eligible to upgrade to a new phone every other year, at which point I would renew my cell contract, plunk down $200, and walk away with an “S” model iPhone.Times have changed. It’s now easier to untether yourself from a carrier contract and buy an unlocked phone outright (or, in Apple’s case, via the iPhone Upgrade Program). And as phones have become more capable and durable, with better cameras, longer battery life, water-resistance, and stronger glass able to withstand a few inevitable drops, upgrading every other year no longer feels necessary. Apple has ditched the “S” branding that once marked a phone that wasn’t getting a huge redesign, but the iPhone 13 is largely considered an “S” iPhone. What’s the point of upgrading to an iPhone that looks similar to last year’s? Well, most people don’t get a new phone every year, and plenty of folks do still upgrade through their carriers. This year Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are doing the most to convince you to get an iPhone 13. It almost goes without saying, but I’ll say it: If you have an iPhone 12, you don’t really need a 13. But if you want one and you can get one at a steep discount, or free, then it’s worth the upgrade for the battery life alone. If you own an older iPhone, like an 11, XS, X, or 8, the iPhone 13 is a much more substantial upgrade—even more so if you go with the 13 Pro or Pro Max.Every year, the iPhone gets a better camera, and this year is no different. The entire 13 lineup has improved lenses that shoot better photos in low light, and all four new iPhones offer a new cinematic video mode that’s like portrait mode for videos. Like the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, the 13 Pro and Pro Max stand apart from the cheaper 13 and 13 Mini with a trio of lenses, including a telephoto lens. This year’s models now shoot up to 3x optical zoom and have a new macrophotography feature that lets you capture incredible detail at close range. Unlike last year, the 13 Pro and Pro Max have the same camera modules, which means you don’t have to spend more to get better photos. Both the Pro and Pro Max have 12-megapixel standard and ultra-wide lenses with larger sensors, and the new 12-MP telephoto lens offers a 77mm focal length. While camera upgrades are usually under-the-hood, you can literally see how much bigger the lenses are when compared to the 12 Pro/Max—they’re freakin’ huge. Apple says the standard  lens (ƒ/1.5) gathers 2.2 times more light compared to the iPhone 12 Pro and a 49% bump from the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Meanwhile, the 12-MP ultra-wide-angle lens (ƒ/1.8.) has a new autofocus sensor and gathers 92% more light than last year’s models. See some photo samples from the 13 Pro and Pro Max below.  The 13 Pro and Pro Max definitely take better low-light shots than the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, but more importantly, nighttime shots are better than on older iPhones. Given that you can still buy an iPhone 11 from Apple brand new—albeit for cheaper than it was during its model year—that’s important to note.The 13 Pro and Pro Max’s telephoto lenses now support Night Mode, which the 12 Pro models do not. I tested this at a Lucy Dacus concert at the Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where I was seated toward the back of the theater. The 3x zoom photos and videos I took turned out crisp and color accurate, and I was able to capture my two favorite songs as usable videos I could share on Instagram without being embarrassed of the quality (rare for a concert). I compared that to the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s 10x optical zoom with night mode turned on, and got a much closer shot of Dacus center stage. The photo isn’t perfectly clear, but you can see her red lipstick and the details in her guitar, which you can’t see in the iPhone photo. I also gave it a shot with the Pixel 5's Night Sight and digital zoom, but it, uh, didn’t quite work out. The S21 Ultra’s telephoto lens makes me wish Apple would beef up the iPhone’s optical zoom a bit, but the 3x is a definite improvement over the iPhone 12 Pro’s 2x (and even the 12 Pro Max’s 2.5x).The Pro’s other main selling point is a macrophotography feature enabled by the redesigned ultra-wide-angle lens with its new autofocus sensor. Macro isn’t a manual mode you can toggle on like you do for portraits; instead, macro kicks in when you get close enough to a subject—within two centimeters. The Camera app preview then switches to macro in a very obvious visual shift, which I found extremely annoying in my first few days testing the camera but grew accustomed to. The visible lens shift was a helpful visual cue that I had activated macro mode, even though it seems a little janky for Apple software. The company is fixing this with a feature in the Settings menu coming in iOS 15.1 that will let you disable the auto macro switching. You can then shoot macro by tapping on the ultra-wide lens mode (0.5x) and tapping the subject to focus.The macro results are kind of a trip. Blades of grass look like giant green daggers, flower petals look like tunnels, flies look like monsters from another planet. If you’ve ever watched Honey! I Shrunk the Kids and thought, “I want to be those kids,” macro mode is for you. I can’t imagine myself using this setting all the time, but the results are undeniably cool as hell.The camera feature I expect to use far more often is cinematic video, which is enabled on every iPhone 13 model. Cinematic video promises to be portrait mode for video, and I can’t lie: It needs work. But when it does work, it works. Situations tailor-made for cinematic video: well-lit indoor spaces or outdoors in broad daylight with a plan for who you’re shooting and how. Situations in which it does not work: every other one. Low light? Nope. Decent light? Absolutely not. Trying to focus on one or two faces with lots of people around? Good luck. Unless you’re a professional with a shot list, getting a good cinematic video is going to take some real effort—and some frustration. But I also really enjoyed trying.I tested this in a few different scenarios, and didn’t quite achieve the professional-looking videos that Apple’s promos have shown. I did have fun testing it while golfing, though. Every amateur golfer needs footage of their swing to make improvements, and I’m not going to say cinematic video makes a bad swing look good, but it does make the overall video look way cooler. (LPGA, call me. Whenever you’re ready.)Cinematic video is enabled in both the front- and rear-facing lenses, just like portrait photos are, and while I didn’t capture anything with the selfie cam that I want to publish to the internet, I had a whole lot of fun experimenting with it. I expect the feature to improve, as portrait mode for photos has over time. I wouldn’t recommend anyone rush out to buy an iPhone 13 for cinematic video, but it’s interesting to see what comes out of it.The last camera feature available on all iPhone 13 models is called Photographic Styles. This is another setting buried in the Camera app’s toolbar, (did I mention how bloated that app is becoming?) Apple has essentially created filters that make your photos warmer, cooler, higher contrast, etc. You can also create a custom style that you can apply to all of your photos. Importantly, you have to select a style before you start shooting, so it’s slightly different from a filter that you can apply after the fact. (You also can’t change a style from, say, Vibrant to Cool in post.) Apple says the styles adjust different aspects of a photo without changing details like skin tone.Reader, this feature is fine. As you can see above, the styles do change the photo as a filter would.  The iPhone camera has always been more true-to-life than its rivals; Photographic Styles lets you add some drama without going too heavy-handed like Samsung’s phones can.And, lastly, Apple is rolling out a new file format for professionals called ProRes video. It’s similar to the company’s ProRAW format for photographers, and while it sounds useful for filmmaking and editing, it’s a) not available to try yet, and b) not relevant for most iPhone buyers. Some people don’t care about taking the best photos, but if there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that phones need to last longer on a charge. This is where Apple has stepped it up significantly. The iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max were already two of the longest-lasting smartphones you could buy, and Apple supersized the batteries and took the 13 Pro and Pro Max to the next level.In Gizmodo’s video rundown battery test, the 13 Pro lasted 16 hours and 21 minutes, a full two hours and 11 minutes longer than the 12 Pro and just 10 minutes shy of the 12 Pro Max. The 13 Pro Max lasted 19 hours and 30 minutes, three hours longer than the 12 Pro Max. Anecdotally, I used the 13 Pro Max for two and a half days before it dwindled below 10%, and I’m the kind of iPhone user whose weekly Screen Time reports are appalling to normal people. I would definitely still charge up overnight out of habit, but this makes it possible to have days of heavy usage or forget to charge one night without stressing.Like the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max, the 6.1-inch 13 Pro and 6.7-inch Pro Max are more high-end than their cheaper siblings. The Pro models trade aluminum for stainless steel trim and matte glass backs, and the effect is particularly stunning in the new Sierra Blue. The Pros also come in graphite, gold, and silver.All of the iPhone 13 models have a 20% slimmer notch that also juts down a little more prominently than on notched iPhones past. You get a little bit of screen back, but there’s not much that can be done with it. I still can’t see the battery indicator in the top status bar, so I’m not quite sure why Apple bothered. But, hey, maybe next year we get no notch.One major feature that sets the Pro models apart from the 13 and 13 Mini is a new 120Hz display that can adjust its refresh rate on the fly depending on what content you’re looking at—viewing still images requires a lower refresh rate than scrolling through websites or playing games, for instance. It’s similar to the ProMotion display on the iPad Pros, and it’s definitely noticeable when compared side by side to an iPhone with a 60Hz display—scrolling on an older iPhone looks more jagged. For a certain type of phone user, refresh rates are high priority making this change a big deal. Many users—I’d argue most—will not notice.Apple didn’t break the mold here; Android phones have had 120Hz screens for years now. Developers still have to optimize third-party apps for the new iPhone’s refresh rate, so it’s not like you’re going to see massive improvements across the board right away. But it’s a welcome shift, even if not a groundbreaking one.The iPhone 13 lineup runs on Apple’s latest A15 Bionic processor, with a 6-core CPU and 5-core CPU, and suffice to say it’s the most powerful phone chip out there—really, it’s not even close. In synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench 5, which measures overall system performance, the 13 Pro and Pro Max blaze past Android flagships running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 chip by a huge margin. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3, with its 3419 multi-core and 1077 single-core scores, is no match for the Pro Max (4770 multi-core and 1744 single-core). The A15 is also much faster than the A14 Bionic that powers the 12 lineup, and if you’ve got an 11, XS, X, or 8, you’re going to notice that everything feels a lot snappier.The iPhone gets faster and more powerful every single year, and at this point, we’ve just come to expect a big performance bump. Whether you need it is a different question, but if you’re a power user who needs a capable multitasker, the iPhone 13 Pro is it.Every smartphone has its drawbacks. Samsung’s experimental hardware and impressive cameras make you feel like you’re living in the future, but the software experience on that cutting-edge hardware is hit or miss. Case in point: Samsung has offered a portrait mode video feature on multiple handsets in recent years, and yet even on its flagship Galaxy S21 Ultra the effect is wildly uneven. Google excels at useful software features, but its Pixel phones look extremely dated and its AI-powered camera magic is no longer leading the industry. Apple’s sweet spot is the integration of hardware and software, but the company is playing it safe on both fronts.But things are about to get interesting. Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are coming soon, built on Google’s in-house chipset. Samsung is hitting its stride with foldable phones. Next year’s iPhone 14 is rumored to sport a redesign that finally ditches the notch. And Microsoft is, uh, still trying, which we love to see.Lately, I’ve been reading old iPhone reviews. Not just Gizmodo’s—though those are fun—but from mainstream outlets and tech enthusiast sites alike. The “S” year reviews in particular are interesting. Every “S” phone gets a better camera and a faster chip. The iPhone 4S added a “faster CPU, better camera, and new software to a familiar-looking phone.” The iPhone 5S chip was twice as fast as the 5's, but one reviewer said, “nobody was exactly complaining about the iPhone’s speed before.”The iPhone 4S also, for better or worse, brought us Siri. The iPhone 5S introduced Touch ID. And the year that Apple introduced the trailblazing iPhone X with secure facial recognition, millions of people bought the iPhone 8, which was essentially a 7S, introduced that same year.Every year, the iPhone gets a little better, and sometimes we don’t realize immediately which new features will resonate over time. When I upgraded to the 4S, I didn’t realize Siri would become my foe, still unable to set multiple timers. And who knew the iPhone 5S fingerprint sensor would become something we longed for in a world where everyone is masked? The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are faster, have better cameras, and pack improved software in a familiar-looking phone. If you need to upgrade, they’re worth buying. Next year’s iPhone might be better, but next year’s iPhone is always better."
4,Galaxy Z Fold 3,https://gizmodo.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-review-foldable-phones-are-finally-rea-1847552057," Samsung’s biggest and baddest foldable phone has come a long way in three generations. The original Galaxy Fold was a bold (though unpolished) glimpse at an entirely new category of handset, but also somewhat experimental. Then came the Galaxy Z Fold 2, which sported a much more refined design. But with the brand new Galaxy Z Fold 3, Samsung has created something that can  handle the stresses of daily life while offering more functionality than you can get on any other phone today. It’s somewhat bulky, and at $1,800, it definitely ain’t cheap. But the Z Fold 3 finally feels like Samsung’s foldables are ready for prime time.Listen, I know a car analogy is a little cringe, but in this situation, I feel like the comparison is pretty apt. Hear me out: If a smartphone with a glass display is your average sedan, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is definitely a luxury SUV. Measuring 0.62 inches when folded at its thickest point and weighing 9.5 ounces, the Z Fold3 is noticeably bigger and heavier than your average handset. But when you want to drive deep into content, that extra heft pays dividends by allowing you to unfurl that flexible screen, just like how you get additional passenger capacity in a big SUV via a third row of foldaway seats. Suddenly, there’s so much more room for activities.For 2021, Samsung is sticking with the same general design as with previous Galaxy Folds, which means you get a narrow 6.2-inch exterior Cover Screen that’s best used for quickly checking notifications, messages, or maps when you’re out and about, with a huge 7.6-inch flexible AMOLED display on the inside that opens and closes with an inward-folding hinge. You also get a handy side-mounted fingerprint sensor for easy unlocking, a USB-C port on bottom, and  stereo speakers that deliver relatively full and rich sound in both candy bar mode or when fully unfolded.However, even though Samsung didn’t change much with the Z Fold 3's basic formula, the company did give the new foldable a subtle facelift with more squared-off edges, which make the phone just a bit easier to hold and open, and a stronger hinge that can better hold its position across various modes and angles. In fact, while it’s hard to tell from far away, nearly every dimension of the Z Fold 3 is slightly thinner or smaller than the previous model, including a slightly smaller gap between the two sides of its flexible display when closed. Yes, there’s still a crease in the middle when opened. But as I’ve said before, that crease tends to disappear when viewed directly. It’s only when you peep at it from different angles that you really notice where that divot lies. Honestly, I don’t even notice the crease anymore—it gets edited out in my subconscious, just like those super fine defrosting lines you sometimes find running across a car’s rear windshield.Instead of coming up with a new design for the Z Fold 3, Samsung upgraded both the phone’s exterior and interior displays. On the outside, the Cover Screen now supports a 120Hz refresh rate, so both displays provide the same fluid visuals while still producing excellent brightness (upwards of 700 nits) and vivid colors.However, the more important advancement is the Z Fold 3's interior flexible display: It’s the first to feature Samsung’s new ECO 2 OLED panel tech, which Samsung says consumes 25% less power (while increasing transmittance by 33%), because the ECO 2 doesn’t use a plastic polarizer layer. It’s supposedly more environmentally friendly, too. But my biggest takeaway is that, coming from what was already a great screen on the Z Fold 2, the Z Fold 3's flexible display is even more vibrant, with brightness that topped out at more than 750 nits in our testing. And it’s really this interior screen that makes the whole phone worth buying, because when you want to play a game, watch a video, or simply share a meme with a friend, the Z Fold 3's giant, high-res 2208 x 1768 display make it possible to put a tablet-sized screen in your pocket, ready to adjust to any task at hand. It just makes everything better, from scanning QR code menus at restaurants to my nightly game of Catan with my wife.But there’s more: Though the Z Fold 3's interior is somewhat soft compared to a standard glass display, i.e. you really shouldn’t use your nails to navigate around, Samsung has added S Pen support to the Z Fold 3, essentially supersizing the best feature of the Galaxy Note line. For stylus fans, this upgrade is such a no-brainer, because being able to draw and take notes on a bigger screen means you feel less constricted than before. You even get two S Pen options to choose from: the $50 S Pen Fold Edition, and the more expensive S Pen Pro, which comes with the added bonus of working with other Samsung devices with S Pen support instead of just the Z Fold 3.So far, I’ve only had the chance to check out the S Pen Fold Edition, and even though it’s a bit basic, meaning you don’t get support for features like Air Actions, it has all the necessary functions covered, with a handy button for erasing and a selection of nibs included in the box. The S Pen Fold Edition is also entirely passive, so you don’t need to worry about keeping it charged. But what’s really nifty is that in order to protect the Z Fold 3's screen, both of Samsung’s new S Pens have a feature that automatically retracts the stylus nib if it detects that you’re pressing too hard. After all, who wants to damage their screen simply because they have lead hand? That said, in my experience, I never triggered the nib rectraction aside from the handful of times I tested it intentionally by pushing down extra hard.Really, the only downside to the Z Fold 3's S Pen support is that there isn’t a built-in cubby hole to store a stylus when it’s not being used, forcing you to buy one of Samsung’s special cases, or stick it behind your ear all day and pretend you’re cosplaying as an architect or something.When it comes to processing power, the Z Fold 3 features top-notch specs across the board, including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip (in North America), 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of base storage (or 512GB if you pay for the $100 upgrade). Regardless of whether you’re simply surfing social media or playing games, the Z Fold 3 has the responsiveness of a finely-tuned performance SUV (Lamborghini Urus, anyone?), with strong benchmarks across the board to back up its turbo real world performance. The only phones that might beat the Z Fold 3 in an all out race are possible the extremely extra gaming phones like the Asus ROG Phone 5s, which features a slightly newer Snapdragon 888+ chip and even more RAM depending on the specific config.Where things get a bit tricky for the Z Fold 3 is the way it handles apps on its big flexible screen. Samsung has made a number of notable improvements, but there’s still some jankiness under the hood. One of the biggest changes is that when opened up, the Z Fold 3 uses the tablet version of a lot of Samsung apps, which typically feature UI better suited for the Z Fold 3's display. For example, when using the Samsung Internet Browser, instead of tabs being hidden behind a hamburger menu, you can see your tabs across the top of the app just like you would on a desktop.To make other apps work better on the Z Fold 3's tablet screen, Samsung has been working with Microsoft, Google, and others, so now you get more customized interfaces in apps like YouTube and Outlook, including updated Flex Mode layouts for some apps to make them easier to use when the Z Fold 3 is positioned halfway open like a laptop. Using YouTube,  you get a widescreen view on the top half and comments show up on bottom. But even three years in, pickings are still kind of thin for Z Fold support, with only about 50 apps that have been optimized for foldable devices. But hopefully there are more to come.The Z Fold 3 introduces a software taskbar that you can configure to live on the side of the screen, providing an easy way to jump into multitasking. To turn on the taskbar, you have to enable one of the Samsung Labs options, then tell the phone to pin the taskbar to the side of the screen, which is not exactly an intuitive process.To create a multi-window mode, all you have to do is drag and drop an app icon from the Taskbar or Edge panel onto a part of the screen, followed by another app (or two) if you want multiple apps at once. And while I love being able to use a desktop-like taskbar on a phone as flexible as the Z Fold 3, I also feel like the taskbar is somewhat redundant when you consider there’s already a row of apps that are pinned along the bottom edge of the screen, which might be better repurposed on Samsung’s foldable phones.Then there are other somewhat clunky aspects to navigating the Z Fold 3's software. For instance, the process to create app pairs involves first arranging your apps and window sizes how you want, and then hitting a button on the window pane to create a new app pair icon. To me it feels like you should be able to create app pairs without needing to fully launch the app itself, like you can when creating a shortcut on a PC. But I think this says more about how multitasking on hybrid device is still a work in progress for both Samsung and the industry at large. While it’s not always a smooth ride, Samsung is trying to pave the way toward more productive portability—even if the destination is still just out of reach.By far one of the biggest questions about foldable phones (and flexible screens in general) is how well they will hold up over time. It’s something I’ve thought about a lot during my time with my personal Z Fold 2, which I’ve written about before. With the Z Fold 3, Samsung seems to have addressed all of the major concerns.Previous Galaxy Fold devices didn’t come with any form of water resistance, but with the Z Fold 3, you get an IPX8 rating certified to withstand submersions of up to five feet for up to 30 minutes. Just this is a huge upgrade, because not only does it mean that the Z Fold 3 is better able to withstand everyday life, it also means today’s foldables aren’t coming up short in durability compared to traditional flagship phones, on which water resistance has become a standard feature.To prevent issues like the one I had with my Galaxy Z Fold 2, where the factory pre-installed screen protector began peeling away from the display itself, Samsung said it’s using a much stronger adhesive and switching to a new PTE material (instead of TPU), which the company said helps increase the durability of the Z Fold 3's screen by 80%. Now obviously it’s impossible to say for sure what kind of effect the Z Fold 3's newfound ruggedness will deliver in the long run, but you can bet your ass I’m going to find out.Samsung created a new type of aluminum alloy it’s calling Armor Aluminum for the Z Fold 3's hinge. The company claims it’s stronger than before and has more bristles on the inside to keep dirt out. That said, there is one more thing that will require more digging into, which is how Samsung plans to support and service its new flagship foldables. The company is making a big push to get its latest Z-series phones into the hands of average smartphone owners instead of just power users and hardcore nerds, and if the Z Fold 3 actually does go mainstream, there will be more demand for service when things inevitably break.After the screen protector on my Z Fold 2 started bubbling, I tried to have it fixed by taking it to Samsung’s flagship retail store in NYC, along with two authorized Samsung Service Centers. But to my dismay, none of the three stores had extra screen protectors in stock, which meant the only way I could have that part properly replaced was to send my phone in via snail mail and lose access to it for around 15 days.Now I don’t know about you, but losing access to your phone (especially if you’re like most people and don’t have a backup device  around) doesn’t strike me as particularly great service, particularly on a very expensive phone that’s less than a year old. There’s a reason why Apple’s Genius Bars are routinely praised for helping people deal with things like cracked screens or replacement batteries, which can often be repaired in store that day. However, Samsung claims that with the wider rollout of Samsung Care+, there should be much more extensive coverage and support for Z Fold 3 owners. Right now, it’s hard to say how hard (or easy) taking the Z Fold 3 into the shop will be.I was disappointed to see that that four of the Z Fold 3's five cameras are using the same hardware as last year (with some slight software tweaks). You get a 10-MP hole-punch selfie camera on the top edge of the Cover Screen, along with triple lenses in back: a 12-MP main cam, a 12-MP ultra-wide cam, and a 12-MP telephoto cam with a 2x optical zoom.Now don’t get me wrong, the Z Fold 3 offers solid image quality, firmly placing it in the top tier of today’s mobile phones. But there’s a part of me that wishes the Z Fold 3 had the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s 108-MP main cam or its 10x optical zoom. When you’re spending $1,800 on a phone, that doesn’t seem like an unreasonable ask, even if it might make the Z Fold 3's camera module much bulkier. If you prefer a powerful range of photography tools or industry-leading image quality, you’re better off going with the S21 Ultra or a Pixel 5 (or waiting for the upcoming Pixel 6), even though those phones are definitely not comparable to the Z Fold 3.And finally there’s the Z Fold 3's new interior under-display camera. In its ongoing quest to eliminate distractions like notches or hole-punch cut-outs from smartphone screens forever, Samsung created the world’s first under-display lens for a flexible display.However, like a lot of first-gen tech, there are some definite trade-offs. Instead of being completely invisible, the Z Fold 3's under-display camera looks more like it’s being camouflaged rather than fully hidden. The challenge is that because the pixels and transistors that go in a smartphone’s display reduce the amount of light that can get to the camera’s sensor, overall image quality takes a hit.In an attempt to let as much light as possible pass through the Z Fold 3's flexible screen to the camera underneath, Samsung reduced the pixel density of the display directly above the camera significantly (to around 25% of what it would be normally), so there’s a noticeable drop in resolution.And while I think the under-display camera’s results fall short overall, it’s a strong first effort. If you’re looking at the lens on top of a white or black background, it’s still pretty obvious. But that’s OK, because typically those very light or dark backgrounds come from letterboxing while watching movies or the phone’s notification bar. What really sold me on the Z Fold 3's under-display lens was when playing games, because even though it’s still pretty easy to see the RGB sub-pixels on that part of the display, the location of the UDC and the resolution it does have is just enough to make you forget it’s there unless you’re purposefully trying to look for it. And that’s really all you need.Compared to the exterior display’s selfie cam, there’s a noticeable drop in quality in the photos you get from the interior screen’s under-display lens. But I think that’s just fine, because I can count on one hand the number of times I used my Z Fold 2's interior cam. That UDC is more of a bonus utility than anything else, so you can do stuff like take video calls while using the Z Fold 3's big flexible display, and for situations like that, the under-display cam is totally serviceable.While it might seem odd that the Z Fold 3's 4,400 mAh battery is actually smaller than what you got on last year’s device, the increased energy efficiency from Samsung’s Eco 2 screen more than makes up for a slightly diminished capacity. On our video rundown test, the Galaxy Z Fold3 lasted a pretty incredible 18 hours and 33 minutes, edging out the Pixel 5a’s record of 18:18. That test was run on the large interior display, so you’ll be sure to get even longer battery life if you’re exclusively using the Cover Screen (for whatever reason).So here’s the real oil check. The Z Fold 3 officially goes on sale on Aug. 27 for $1,800, which is $200 less than last year’s Z Fold 2 price tag. And while that minimal savings is nice, it’s hard to argue that the Z Fold 3 is a must-buy, even if you’re rolling in disposable cash. The Z Fold 3 really is the smartphone equivalent of a luxury SUV. It’s got a great build,  improved durability, and the kind of flexible functionality that makes it easy to accomplish quick tasks on the street or access content on a giant screen, whichever scenario arises. And goddamn is it a pleasure to use, especially if you’re a big-screen aficionado.But even for me, an early adopter who’s all in on these devices, the Z Fold 3 is not exactly what I’d call a wise purchase. As someone who’s extremely curious about this new generation of foldable screen tech, I really want to see what the wear-and-tear will be like first-hand, both in the immediate future and after months of bumps. Car reviewer extraordinaire Doug Demuro does a great job of explaining why anyone would want to buy an unusual product like this: They’re just really interesting. Out of all of the phones you can buy today, there’s simply nothing that offers the blend of power and adaptability you get with the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Say hello to the birth of the, uh, sports utility phone (still workshopping that one a bit). "
5,Galaxy Z Flip 3,https://gizmodo.com/the-galaxy-z-flip-3-is-almost-the-android-flip-phone-of-1847514210,"The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the Android smartphone of my dreams—mostly. It’s everything I loved about my flip phone from the early aughts, combined with the abilities of a flagship smartphone. But just as I had to ease into the idea of an all-screen phone a decade ago, I’m now finding myself taking a beat before jumping to a foldable.The Z Flip 3's flip-down body is a total flashback to the past. I’ve never felt more satisfied hanging up on a video call—regular phone calls are less frequent in this day and age—or even shutting the phone closed after a raid gone bad in Pokémon Go. I love the malleability of the Z Flip 3, which is unlike anything we had back in the day. It has all the requisite features you want out of a high-end smartphone, along with a form factor that lets you take better selfies, pocket the device in a pair of jeans, and even take it around shallow bodies of water. As with everything in life, there are caveats. The main one here is that there is a learning curve because the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a different type of phone. The differences were enough to become a disruption to my daily routine that led me back to my brick phone to move more quickly between tasks. Perhaps that speaks more to the general state of the world to which Samsung is marketing its new foldable smartphones than anything else. And I think that’s something to consider if you’re thinking about switching to the Galaxy Z Flip 3.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is Samsung’s third-generation effort at putting the flip phone back into the gadget zeitgeist. Its design is sure to turn heads, which Samsung is betting on. Every Snapchat ad (yes, I still use Snapchat) I’ve seen for the folding phones thus far claims that people will do double-takes when they see the device. I experienced a variety of reactions myself each time I showed off the Z Flip 3. A few folks seemed awed by the folding mechanism, while another friend was vehemently against the entire idea of a folding smartphone.But flipping the phone closed is only one way to use the Galaxy Z Flip 3. When laid out, it looks and functions like a regular “flat” phone. It has a shiny backside, though the fill is matte and solid, giving it a similar effect to a car with a solid color chassis. The glass back is also very slippery, so it will need a bit of a watchful eye if you’re without a case to keep it from sliding around or off a table. The Z Flip 3's overall aesthetic is fun—what an advertising executive might refer to as “young at heart.” Samsung is offering seven different color options, three of which are exclusively available online. There’s both a pink and purple variant, plus cream, green, grey, and phantom black. And paired with one of its bold-colored silicon cases, the Z Flip 3 is one of the cutest smartphones available. You will likely see it sprout up in gadget aesthetic TikToks and Instagram Reels in the coming months. Brace yourselves.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is Samsung’s third iteration of the folding flip phone, so it’s had some time to figure out the overall design. Unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which hails the company’s new under-display camera technology, the Z Flip has a punch-out camera squarely in the middle of the 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display. That helps cut down on the outer bezel of the Z Flip 3, which is noticeably bigger than the OnePlus 9 Pro, for example. I don’t mind the bezel, as the phone needs that bit of structure to help retain the folding display. It also gives me more options for gripping the phone, which is already a bit tricky with its tall, narrow profile.When the Z Flip 3 is laid out flat, it looks and functions like any other smartphone. I can still toss Poké balls, tap and select a mass of text, switch between applications, or clip it into a tripod in landscape mode to shoot photos. There is a noticeable crease in the middle of the Galaxy Z Flip 3's 1080 x 2640 resolution display, though only when you’re staring carefully. From afar, and while there’s a video playing on screen, it’s hardly noticeable. The screen’s 120Hz refresh rate certainly helps make up for it.There is a protective film over the screen to help maintain the integrity of the flexible display over time. I’m curious to see how the display panel will fare over months of use. Samsung claims each of its folding devices can do so about 200,000 times with nary a crack. After a little over a week with this phone, I’m still trying to figure out how to handle the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in a way that feels natural. I had a heck of a time typing fast with my long nails, so I reluctantly cut them, hoping I’d have a more effortless time multitasking. That’s when I realized that the issue for me is the lack of the third-party accessory I rely on the most: the Pop Socket. I have become so reliant on its existence over the years—I started using one when I bought the first-generation Google Pixel. Every case for every phone I’ve used since then has had one. So when I converted over to the Z Flip 3, I had to adjust my use. I was cradling the Z Flip 3 a little more carefully at first since I didn’t have that extra apparatus on the back to hang on to. The silicon case helped me grip the Z Flip 3 with a little more confidence, and I started to use the included keychain loop on the back, similar to how I’d use a Pop Socket to secure the phone between my fingers. If you’ve built your life around one particular way of handling a smartphone, the Z Flip 3 will throw a wrench into that.Remember when you could satisfyingly hang up on someone by simply flipping a phone shut? It’s hard to do one-handed with the Galaxy Z Flip 3. Though it’s possible, the phone requires a bit of “breaking in” before it’s soft enough to take that wielding. I had a hard time opening and closing it with just my dominant hand. Anyway, the flip phones that I was handling as a young adult were much smaller than this relative behemoth.Another way to use the Z Flip 3, which I ended up using the most, is by folding it at an angle so that half of the screen is in use with your app and choice, and the other half acts as a prop a second display of sorts. In most instances, you’ll see a navigational menu pop up at the bottom, with options to adjust the volume and screen brightness, as well as an option to bring down the notification panel so that you don’t have to attempt to drag your finger across the bent-up display. There’s also a handy screenshot button, though the screen cap will include the navigational buttons, so you’ll have to crop it if you want to leave that bit out.Not every app can natively support the Z Flip 3's folding display mechanism, but a Labs feature hidden deep in the settings menu will force any app you want into the half-screen mode. It’s great for watching videos and works with apps like Pluto TV, YouTube TV, and Paramount+. The downside here is, you’re not using the entirety of the Z Flip 3's vivid display, only a mere fraction. It’s fine at night before dozing off before bed, and I can even see myself using this when we’re flying again.With the apps that didn’t translate well to the half-screen mode, I was reminded why we no longer have 3- and 4-inch displays. It’s simply not enough screen space! It was fine for messaging apps and text-based social networks like Twitter. But anything more graphical, and it feels like the screen gets cut off. And even when an app works fine on the half screen, sometimes it’s too small to use feasibly.Google and Samsung redeveloped a few of the Z Flip 3's included apps to better adapt to the faux dual display. For instance, in the Samsung Gallery app, the top half of the screen is for the image preview, while the bottom acts as a touchpad and navigation carousel. The camera app offers a similar interface, with camera controls at the bottom and the top half serving as a viewfinder. It’s especially beneficial when you’re trying to frame a photo and you don’t have a tripod in tow.The 1.9-inch Super AMOLED color display on the back of the device is one of my favorite features of the Z Flip 3. Samsung beefed it up over its predecessor by adding slightly more screen and functionality. I like to stand it up in front of my keyboard during work hours to track the time and notifications as they come in. The screen is small, so you’ll have to open the phone up for some of the longer notifications, but at least you can get a preview before you commit.When you double-tap the screen, the wallpaper or graphic of your choice pops up. (It looks slick in person.) You can then slide to the right for current notifications or the left for Z Flip-specific widgets. They remind me of the ones that I already use on the Galaxy Watch Active. However, most of them act as exterior placeholders, and if you need to do more than peek at a stat, you’ll have to open the phone for most options. The best part of the cover display is that it acts as a preview window for the primary camera. This means you can take high-resolution selfies with the Galaxy Z Flip 3's 12-megapixel camera, which includes optical image stabilization. Double press the power button as you would with the phone open to launch the camera, then tap the screen to being a quick two-second countdown. It’s enough time to fluff up your hair and fake a smile.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 has similar camera hardware as in the last Z Flip. It’s still capable of capturing both the exciting and the mundane daily. The Z Flip 3 is equipped with two main cameras: a 12-megapixel camera with an f/1.8 aperture and a wide-angle lens with PDAF and the OIS mentioned above. There’s also an additional 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.2 aperture that has a 123-degree ultrawide lens. Unfortunately, I had the worst conditions for shooting outdoor photography, as the state of California is smack dab in the middle of its annual fire season. At least I could determine how Samsung handles color profiles compared to the Pixel 5 and OnePlus 9 Pro. On a particularly smokey day, the Z Flip 3's photos skewed green and were profoundly contrasted. I can tell Samsung is still heavily into saturating the final product, which produces punchier images outright. The Pixel 5's photos are much more subdued, and though its color profile seems more tuned to the real thing, Samsung’s approach made the atmosphere decidedly less apocalyptic despite the green hue. The OnePlus 9 Pro appeared more sepia and gold-toned when photographing dry grass, and I found its result to be more pleasing to the eye than either the Pixel 5 or Galaxy Z Flip 3.Samsung’s nighttime camera performance has gotten better in recent years, but it still has some work to do to improve over the Pixel’s final shots. Samsung’s result of a starry photo shot featured more silhouettes, and the color reproduction appeared more realistic compared to what I saw for myself while looking out the window. But the Pixel 5's Night Mode picked up more ambient light from the background, which adds more depth to the scene. I also found the Pixel 5's color reproduction in dim light to be more pleasing than Samsung’s. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 did excel at sharpness, however, and most of the photos I snapped without a tripod were clearer when zooming in than the Pixel 5.It’s not technically a front-facing or a selfie camera since the Z Flip 3 lets you do the latter with the main camera hardware. The inside camera lens is 10-megapixels with an f/2.4 aperture capability. It works well for video chats and Instagram confessionals. But you’ll find that the prime selfie experience, whether solo or with friends, is vis-a-vis the primary camera with the phone shut tight.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is one of the first of Samsung’s devices to feature a 5nm Snapdragon 888 on the inside. It’s excellent news for component consolidation, but don’t expect the highest performing silicon in the business yet. Still, that doesn’t mean the Z Flip 3 isn’t as capable as other smartphones on the market.Along with its 8GB of RAM, this smartphone is a relative powerhouse in its own right. I felt no stutter switching between games, apps, videos, and podcasts. In Geekbench 5, the Z Flip 3 scored 3180 in multicore, putting it along with the ranks of last year’s OnePlus 8 Pro and its flagship sibling, the Galaxy S21. Battery performance had me more worried, considering the Z Flip 3's giant display and high refresh rate. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 has a 3300 mAh battery on the inside with 15W fast charging capabilities, 10W wireless fast charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. That’s quite a few ways to work with such a small battery pack, at least compared to the other big-screened smartphones that have come out in recent years. Even Samsung’s Galaxy S21 has a larger 4000 mAh battery for its 6.2-inch screen. Ultimately, I managed about 11 hours in full in Gizmodo’s battery rundown test before the Z Flip 3 wholly petered out. It’s shorter than the Pixel 5's 16 hours, and even the Galaxy S21 managed at least 12 hours.There are still some things I’m figuring out about this particular form factor. Most of it has to do with Samsung’s One UI and its interpretation of Android specially tailored to its smartphones. Some of the menu structures vary from what I’m used to on Google’s version of Android on the Pixel or even OnePlus’s version of Oxygen OS running atop Android 11 on its flagship smartphones. That’s all to say that if you haven’t been on a Samsung device in a while, remember that it’s the company’s version of Android and not necessarily Google’s, despite how closely the two companies worked together to make apps better accommodate to folding screens. At the very least, Samsung has committed itself to three years of major software updates, about on par with what Google offers. But as the company’s track record has proven thus far, you’re like to get the latest version of Android a bit later than when Google pushes it out to the Pixel devices.Every time I pick up the Galaxy Z Flip 3, I think about whether this is a form factor I could see myself living with day in and day out. Truthfully, I’m still straddling the line. Though there is plenty to like about this flip phone, the fact that it folds is a serious commitment to a new way of using a smartphone. Snapping a photo takes a beat as you move to flip open the phone and get the camera situated. Holding the phone one-handed is hard without help from a case accessory since the screen is so tall. And you’ll have to make some concessions to battery life, which is sure to show its limitations over time.If you’re curious about the experience and are willing to take the plunge, the price is a little less daunting than it used to be. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 starts at $1,000, but sales and discount offerings can get the phone to as low as $500 outright. That’s only $50 more than the Pixel 5a, which is a traditional smartphone with mid-range offerings. But you’ll still have to ask yourself if it’s worth trading in what you’ve known all this time for a brand new experience."
6,Pixel 5a,https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-5a-review-the-new-king-of-mid-range-1847496782,"Ever since Google got into the mid-range phone game with the Pixel 3a, Google’s most affordable handsets have just been getting better and better. And when you combine all of Google’s Pixel-only software features with an even bigger screen, improved durability, and new support for water resistance on the new Pixel 5a, it really feels like Google—not Motorola or OnePlus—is the new king of mid-range handsets. And better yet, with a price tag of $450, the Pixel 5a might be Google’s best value ever.Like previous Pixel A-series phones, the Pixel 5a couldn’t be any simpler. You get a beautiful 2400 x 1080 OLED display, stereo speakers, a punch-hole selfie shooter, two rear cameras, USB-C port, and a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor—basically all the standard features you’d expect on a modern smartphone. And once again, the Pixel 5a still has a 3.5mm jack for wired audio (but no microSD card slot).But that doesn’t mean there aren’t upgrades, and on the Pixel 5a, Google has been quite clever in its strategy—especially considering the ongoing global chip crunch. Standing at 6.34-inches diagonally, the Pixel 5a’s screen is the biggest on any Pixel A-series phone yet, while also boasting excellent brightness that hit upwards of 800 nits during our testing. So even though fans of small may be disappointed that there isn’t a pint-sized Pixel A this year, giving everyone else more screen for the money is a valuable addition.Meanwhile, on the inside, Google has switched over to a new metal chassis that’s covered with a matte black plastic shell, combining improved strength with a soft-touch finish that’s quite nice to hold. And for the first time ever on a Pixel A phone, the Pixel 5a features IP-67 water resistance, so you don’t have to worry about an errant splash or a drop in the toilet ruining your day (it’s ok, it happens to everyone). Finally, in back, the Pixel 5a features two rear cameras that Google says are exactly the same as what came on last year’s mainline Pixel 5 (more on those later). It’s practically everything you could really want or need on a mid-range phone aside from wireless charging (which would be nice, but is an understandable omission).Oh, and one important note about the Pixel 5a is that while it does come with a power brick included in the box, this may be the last time Google does that. Like a lot of other smartphone makers, Google has been planning to stop bundling power bricks with phones to help cut down on e-waste; according to the company, the number of people who don’t already have a USB-C is getting to the point where shipping phones with power bricks is becoming redundant. Look, I don’t make the rules, but that’s how it is.One of the aspects affected most by the global chip crunch is the availability of processors, so instead of upgrading to a brand new SoC, Google stuck with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G—the same chip Google used in the regular Pixel 5. And you know what, it still holds up. Sure, it’s not a powerhouse by any means, but the 765G (along with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of built-in storage) more than held its own in benchmarks compared to other mid-range phones like the TCL 20 Pro 5G (review on that coming soon). It was also enough to keep apps and games feeling smooth and stutter-free (unless you’re playing intense FPS titles), which is all I’m really looking for in a mid-range handset.The one strange wrinkle is that while the Pixel 5 has support for both mmWave and sub-6 Ghz 5G—despite having the same chip, the Pixel 5a only supports sub-6GHz 5G connectivity. This means you’ll be able to tap into the wider coverage areas that you get with sub-6Ghz, but you won’t get those super-fast 1000 Mbps+ download speeds that mmWave 5G often provides.One of the biggest advantages Google’s Pixel A-series phones have over other mid-range devices are their cameras, and by going with the same setup it used on the standard Pixel 5, the Pixel 5a can easily hang with more expensive rivals. And while I’d really love to see Google add support for a dedicated zoom lens, Google’s Super-Res Zoom still gives you a little extra reach without huge drawbacks in image quality.In typical bright light situations, the Pixel 5a’s 12-MP wide and 16-MP ultra-wide angle cameras consistently captured rich, properly exposed images, even beating Samsung’s Galaxy S21 in a number of head-to-head comparisons. When I snapped test shots at a new local restaurant, both the Pixel 5a and S21 snapped vibrant photos with great colors. But if you zoom in, you’ll notice that the Pixel 5a’s shot captured sharper details, especially on those  fries below (and yes, they tasted as good as they look). But to me, the most impressive comparison was a side-by-side of a challenging shot of a flower in direct sunlight. While the S21's shot was good, Samsung’s over-saturated colors wasn’t able to capture the finer textures you see in the Pixel 5a’s pic.And when it gets dark, the Pixel 5a can fall back on Google’s Night Sight processing, which is still one of the best in the business, especially in really low-light conditions. When I snapped a nighttime cityscape, the Pixel 5a and S21's photos were incredibly close—no small feat for a phone that costs hundreds less. But by far the most impressive low-light shot was at a nearby community garden. Even though I could barely make out any details with my own eyes, the Pixel 5a produced a pic that was sharp, detailed, and surprisingly colorful, while also doing a better job of eliminating the yellowish orange tint you see in the S21's shot.Now, I don’t always talk about the software on Android phones because nowadays device makers have gotten pretty good at nailing the basics. But when you take into account all of Google’s Pixel-specific features like its Personal Safety app, Call Screener, Live Captions, and more, it really feels like Pixels make the most out of today’s AI-powered capabilities. And with three full years of OS and security updates, you’re getting longer support than rival phones from companies like Motorola, which often stops sending out updates after a year or two.Frankly, the Pixel 5a’s battery life is so long, I thought our video rundown test was broken. But then I tested it three more times just to be sure, and the results are simply fantastic. With an average battery life of 18 hours and 18 minutes, the Pixel 5a has some of the best longevity we’ve ever seen, beating out every phone I’ve tested this year by at least an hour. So while not everyone loves a huge screen, going larger on its display also meant Google had more room for a bigger battery, and on the Pixel 5a, that tactic truly paid off. I will admit that there is one comparison I have been conveniently ignoring up until now, which is how the Pixel 5a stacks up against Chinese phones with big specs from companies like Xiaomi, Oppo, and others. But my reasoning is simple: They’re not really in the same category. Because, while you can get a phone with big specs for under $500, none of those phones are officially available in the U.S., which means they aren’t a viable option for a lot of people in the land of Uncle Sam.On top that, because of the ongoing chip crunch, the Pixel 5a will only be available in two markets—the U.S. (unlocked only) and Japan (via Softbank)—which means the Pixel 5a isn’t really competing with the Vivos or Realmes of the world either. But most importantly, while a lot of mid-range Chinese phones place a much heavier emphasis on processors and RAM, with the Pixel 5a, Google is focused on simplicity and usability more than anything else. The Pixel 5a has all of a phone’s most important bases covered. It’s got a great screen, a straightforward design (now with water resistance), thoughtful software, and better battery life than anything I’ve seen in recent history (and it’s not even close). And if it was my money, I’d be struggling to come up with reasons to buy anything else."
7,Samsung Galaxy A52,https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-a52-5g-gives-you-the-most-phone-for-you-1846811069,"Samsung’s Galaxy A52 5G has a lot to live up to. Not only is it the successor to last year’s top-selling Android phone, but it’s also the star of Samsung’s new mid-range A-Series (the slightly more premium Galaxy A72 isn’t coming to the U.S). With people holding onto their phones for longer, there’s a good chance a new handset purchased today won’t get replaced for another three or four years. But even with all the pressure, the Galaxy A52 5G still manages to impress, offering a great mix of specs and features for a great price with only a few minor quirks and oddities.The Galaxy A52 combines a mix of premium components with a sturdy (though not terribly exciting) design, and even a few components you don’t even get on Samsung’s more expensive Galaxy S devices. Built around a 6.5-inch 90Hz AMOLED display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution, the A52 offers a large display with rich colors and strong brightness upwards of 750 nits. It’s a great display for a phone in this price range, bridging the gap between the 120Hz OLED panels on Samsung’s premium Galaxy S handsets and the less colorful and cheaper LCD panels you typically see on mid-range devices.From there, Samsung also includes a 32-MP hole-punch selfie camera in the A52's display, along with an in-screen fingerprint reader. It’s important to note that the A52 features an optical fingerprint reader instead of the more sophisticated ultrasonic sensors found on the A52's more expensive siblings. At first, I felt like the A52's sensor was a bit finicky and not quite as fast as I’d hoped, but the more I used the phone, I found that while the A52 seems to be more sensitive to oil and gunk on your fingers, in normal use, it’s still quite speedy and reliable.The A52 also features your standard set of buttons, including a volume rocker and lock button on the right side. But even more importantly, unlike its pricier siblings, the A52 still features a microSD card slot for expandable storage and a dedicated headphone jack, in case the A52's otherwise quite strong stereo speakers aren’t cutting it. So even though I wish Samsung hadn’t axed these components on its premium phones, I’m really happy to see them alive and well on this year’s A-series handsets.Finally, rounding out the A52's design, Samsung includes an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance (down to three feet for 30 minutes). My only gripe is that I wish Samsung had added just one more thing to provide some visual appeal to an otherwise plain device. In the U.S., the A52 only comes in black, missing out on the flashy colors seen on other Samsung phones, leaving you with one of Samsung’s “glasstic” (aka polycarbonate plastic) in back, plastic that’s been painted to look like metal around its sides, and Gorilla Glass 5 in front.Sporting a Snapdragon 720G processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of base storage, the A52 is well equipped for almost anything you can throw at it. In benchmarks, it performed about the same as its biggest rival—the Pixel 4a 5G—on a number of tests, including Geekbench 5, 3DMark, and others. The only area where it might fall a bit short is gaming, because while I didn’t notice any lag in more casual games like Gunbound, more resource-intensive titles like PUBG or Call of Duty Mobile can stress out the A52 a bit, especially if you enable some of their optional graphics settings. A little extra RAM may have helped the A52 overcome stuff like this, but it’s not essential.However, while the A52 does support sub-6Ghz 5G, it doesn’t support mmWave 5G regardless of which carrier or retailer you get it from. To me this is a small knock against the A52, because it means it might not age as well as phones that support both sub-6Ghz and mmWave 5G a year or two down the road. That means if you want better 5G compatibility, you either have to downgrade to the Galaxy A42, or upgrade to the S20 FE or another more premium device like the S21 or OnePlus 9.Compared to previous generations, the A52's biggest improvement might be the quality of its photos, because even though it has a very similar set of cameras (64-MP main, 12-MP ultrawide, 5-MP macro, 5-MP depth), Samsung’s image processing and main camera sensor have gotten noticeably better. Now in most conditions, the A52 can keep pace with the overall image quality you get from a Pixel 4a 5G, while offering a wider range of lenses and features to choose from. In a shot of a mural in NYC, aside from having a slightly brighter exposure resulting in colors that look just a bit less saturated, the A52's shot wasn’t far off from what I got from a Pixel 5 (which features the same main cam as the Pixel 4a 5G). And when I snapped a shot of a sunny cobblestone street, the A52 did even better, capturing great dynamic range and details that might be even sharper than what I got from the Pixel 5.The main area where the A52 falls a bit short is in very low-light environments, where Samsung’s Night Mode just isn’t quite as powerful as Google’s Night Sight mode. For example, in a shootout between the A52 and Pixel 5 at a skatepark at night, Pixel 5 produced a more well-exposed and colorful image without the over-sharpened artifacts I got from the A52's pic. Also, while neither the A52 nor the Pixel 5 sports a true zoom cam, I found that Google’s Super Res zoom often captured digital zoom shots that were slightly sharper and more detailed than shots from the A52. In short, while it can’t take the crown from Google, the A52's camera can still hang with the best phone cameras in its price range.Powered by a 4,500 mAh battery, the Galaxy A52 lasted just shy of 13 hours on our battery test (12:53 to be exact), which is almost half an hour better than current smartphone average (12:25) and the standard Galaxy S21 (12:36). That ain’t bad, though I should note that the Pixel 4a 5G fared even better on the same test with a time of 13:57.However, even though the A52's battery life isn’t quite as good as the Pixel 4a 5G’s, my bigger gripe is its relatively slow charging speeds. That’s because while the A52 can technically handle up to 25-watt wired charging, Samsung only includes a 15-watt power brick in the box, which is fine, but not what I’d call quick. And because the A52 doesn’t have support for wireless charging, this means you may have to be a little more proactive about keeping your phone topped up.The A52's main rival is the Pixel 4a 5G, which has the same $500 price tag but takes a very different approach when it comes to making a good mid-range phone. Google puts a premium on simplicity, opting to concentrate on a handful of core features like image quality, battery life, and software while the rest of the phone sports a streamlined design with just two rear cameras, no official rating for water resistance, and no microSD card slot. That said, on some carriers (most notably Verizon), the Pixel 4a 5G does support both sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G.Meanwhile, the Galaxy A52 5G is more of a maximalist’s take on a mid-range phone, with Samsung throwing a lot of everything into the phone’s kit The A52 has a bigger 6.5-inch display with a 90Hz refresh rate (the Pixel 4a 5G is capped at 60Hz), four rear cams, a micro SD card slot, better speakers, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and more. And with Samsung’s recent commitment to provide three years of OS and monthly security updates for the phone, the A52 should have relatively strong post-purchase software support.Samsung really stuffed the A52 with almost everything you could want on a $500 phone, with small missing items being a 2x optical zoom cam, support for wireless charging, and full mmWave 5G connectivity. But since optical zooms and wireless charging aren’t things you get from a Pixel 4a 5G either, it’s hard to harp on Samsung too much for that.Honestly, the A52's biggest weakness may be its lack of personality, because you don’t get any other color options to choose from, and while its design is quite solid, it doesn’t have a feature or trait that gives it a real wow factor. But when it comes to everything else, Samsung has you covered. The A52 has a big screen with beautiful OLED colors, good battery life, and even expandable storage and a headphone jack. For $500, the A52 isn’t just a good deal, it’s probably the best value in mid-range phones right now."
8,Oneplus 9 ,https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-9-and-9-pro-prove-oneplus-is-oh-so-close-to-1846532054,"Last fall’s OnePlus 8T was a solid device, but it still seemed like OnePlus could step it up. With the release of two new flagship phones, it looks like OnePlus agreed. The new $730 OnePlus 9 and $970 OnePlus 9 Pro sport noticeably improved cameras due to a new partnership with Hasselblad, even faster charging, including wireless charging on both models, and a top-to-bottom spec refresh featuring speedy new components.Editor’s Note: Post launch, OnePlus has confirmed that unlocked OnePlus 9 phones are certified to work on T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G network, although there still isn’t support for AT&T 5G. Make no mistake: Not only are the OP9 and OP9 Pro the best phones OnePlus has ever made, but the company has also gone all New Game+ on us and entered a second phase of life. In its early days, OnePlus catered to the desires of hardcore phone enthusiasts, but the company has since evolved and entered the mainstream. I have to admit: OnePlus has made great strides with its new devices. But a part of me still wonders if it’s really enough.For me, one of the biggest disappointments about the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro is their design, because even though they are both solidly built, they don’t have much in the way of personality. Honestly, if it wasn’t for the various logos scattered around in back, I’m willing to bet that even the most tech-savvy folks would have a hard time differentiating the new OP9 lineup from last year’s Samsung Galaxy S20+. Both phone lines feature similarly rounded designs with curvy sides, and a rectangular camera module in the top right.Aside from OnePlus’s signature Alert Slider, the only detail that really sets the OP9 apart from the S20 lineup is the color options, and while I do like the gradient OnePlus uses on its Morning Mist model, a paint job is only skin-deep. OnePlus even opted for a flatter screen on the standard OP9 along with a plastic polymer back, which are both moves Samsung has made in recent years, while opting for a curvier panel on the OP9 Pro with sloping edges, just like you get on an S20+.The similarities don’t stop there, either. Like Samsung, the OnePlus has added a 120Hz refresh rate to the OP9's 6.55-inch screen, with the the OP9 Pro getting a 6.7-inch Samsung-made panel with a variable 120Hz refresh rate that can dynamically adjust its display to match the kind of content you’re viewing. That means higher refresh rates while gaming to deliver smooth visuals, and lower refresh rates while surfing the web or looking at pictures to help save on battery life. Now I don’t mean to be too harsh, because if you’re gonna crib off of someone else’s notes, you might as well pick the world’s biggest smartphone maker. And if you ignore the competition, the OP9 and OP9 Pro’s displays are great in their own right, offering strong brightness (upwards of 800 nits in our testing), and the rich saturated colors people have come to expect from high-quality AMOLED displays. I just wish OnePlus would inject some of its own style or unique details to make the OP9 line stand out on its own.The base model sports a a Snapdragon 888 chip, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (with a boost to 12GB/256GB available as well), making the OP9 phones are as powerful as ever. Both the OP9 and OP9 Pro routinely rivaled or posted slightly higher benchmark scores than what we’ve seen from similarly specced Samsung phones. And thanks to little touches like the faster animations in OnePlus’ Oxygen OS (which is based on Android 11), the OP9 and OP9 Pro often feel even more responsive than you might expect. When it comes to speed, OnePlus delivers.OnePlus also includes a number of standard features found on other premium phones, including stereo speakers, an in-display fingerprint sensor, water resistance, and 5G, but unfortunately support for some of those features varies greatly depending on where you buy it. On T-Mobile (which is the only U.S. carrier that will carry the OP9 line at retail), you get full 5G connectivity and an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. However, if you get a OP9 or OP9 Pro unlocked, you don’t get the same rugged credentials and you won’t be able to access 5G on AT&T, which is a huge bummer for people who might want to bring their own device to another network. And if I’m really nitpicking, I feel like the OnePlus optical fingerprint sensor isn’t quite as fast or accurate as the ultrasonic reader that Samsung uses on the Galaxy S21. But let’s get down to the biggest upgrades on the OP9 line: the camera performance. OnePlus just inked a 3-year deal to collaborate with Hasselblad, and to start, OnePlus has employed Hasselblad to overhaul its camera app with a new UI and easier ways to adjust settings and edit photos. Additionally, OnePlus also leaned on its new partnership to create Natural Color Calibration with Hasselblad that uses both improved algorithms and hand tuning from experts at Hasselblad to capture more accurate hues and finer details. And I have to say, the results are quite impressive.For years, the image quality of OnePlus phones was always a tier below competing phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google. But that changes on the OP9. Colors are rich and deep, subjects are sharp, and I personally really like the high-contrast look Hasselblad’s tuning has given OnePlus’ photos, even if it doesn’t always result in the most realistic looking image.The standard OP9 features a 48-MP main cam, 50-MP ultra-wide cam (with a huge IMX 766 sensor), and 2-MP monochrome cam to help out with color accuracy. The OP9 Pro features a 48-MP main cam with an even newer Sony IMX789 sensor, the same 50-MP ultra-wide cam used on the OP9, a 3x telephoto zoom cam, and the same handy 2-MP monochrome cam. But regardless of which phone you choose, either one can totally hang with other high-end handsets.In a photo I captured of some tulips, the regular OP9 captured strong dynamic range and good details, even on the inside of the flower. And at night, OnePlus’ improved Nightscape mode kept up with Samsung’s dedicated low-light mode, with the OnePlus 9 Pro even capturing a sharper looking (possibly a bit over-sharpened) photo when zoomed in 3x compared to the Galaxy S21. Even ultra-wide shots from the OP9 and OP9 Pro largely lived up to OnePlus’ claims that its new “free-form” lens helps cut down on the barrel distortion you typically see in wide-angle photos. However, like I said before, while I appreciate Hasselblad’s fine tuning, I have to admit that in a shot of plant-based nuggets (don’t ask), the OP9 did boost contrast a bit too much, which resulted in deeper shadows than what I actually saw. But still, OnePlus’ image quality has taken a big step forward, and with Hasselblad expected to add new custom hardware to future phones, OnePlus’ photography cred is definitely getting a big boost.Finally, when it comes to battery life, both phones performed rather well, with the standard OP9 and OP9 Pro lasting 15 hours and 35 minutes and 13 hours and 54 minutes, respectively. That’s both well above the current 12:25 smartphone average and standard S21's time of 12:36, and in the same range as the iPhone 12 (14:20). When it comes to charging, the OP9 and OP9 Pro are incredibly fast, offering 65-watt wired charging that can legit recharge the phone from dead to 100% in around half an hour. In my testing, starting at 5%, the standard OP9 was able to hit 72% charge in 15 minutes and hit 100% before the full 30 minutes were even up. And as an added bonus, when you want to charge other non-OnePlus devices, you won’t get a full 65 watts of power, but you can still charge over USB-C at up to 45 watts, which is handy if you only want to carry a single power brick around.Of course, wired charging is a bit old-school, so in addition to giving the standard OP9 15-watt Qi wireless charging, OnePlus also made a proprietary $70 charging pad that can deliver 50 watts of wireless power to the OP9 Pro, which was enough to take the phone from 5% to 74% in 30 minutes. In short, this is the fastest wireless charging you can get on any phone available in the U.S. right now.OK, great—but should you get one? The tricky part is that the answer to that question depends greatly on your carrier and how much you care about or have access to 5G. For people on T-Mobile, the OP9 and OP9 Pro are basically slightly discounted versions of the S21 and S21+, and if you’re willing to BYOD, Verizon customers have similar value proposition. You get the same processor and similar base components, with new and improved image quality, and a lot of premium features like water resistance, wireless charging, and high refresh rate screens. However, for people on other networks, the equation isn’t quite as clear, most notably because you not get support for 5G depending on your carrier. And this is kind of the problem for OnePlus, because the company has obviously leveled up in many areas. OnePlus’ collaboration with Hasselblad is already paying off, and with LG’s smartphone division struggling and Google doing its own thing, OnePlus is filling in for other Android phone makers by creating a worthy alternative to Samsung’s flagships. But forgoing support for 5G on one of the nation’s three largest carriers, skipping IP68 certification on unlocked models, and a lackluster design means that OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro stop just short of being true contenders. They’re great phones and a good value for money, but they just don’t have the X-factor you need to turn a solid device into something you love.[Update: 3/31 at 5:30 PM] Updated the review with new info regarding 5G support for unlocked OnePlus 9 phones on T-Mobile and Verizon.

9,Moto G Power,https://gizmodo.com/the-moto-g-power-proves-a-200-phone-has-its-perks-1846369084,"The latest Moto G Power isn’t very pretty, and it’s not that fancy either, but for a simple, well-built phone that starts at just $200, it’s got practically everything you need. And when it comes to its name, the G Power definitely delivers, with battery life that can actually last multiple days. Sure, this phone is incredibly basic, but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing.The G Power was released alongside two other new Moto G phones this winter, the budget $170 Moto G Play and the slightly more sophisticated $300 Moto G Stylus. Inside it’s got a Snapdragon 662 chip that’s passable and doesn’t suffer from any major hiccups, but that’s about it. It’s not great, it’s not bad. It’s fine. The base $200 model comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but if you have wiggle room in your budget, I’d recommend going with the $250 model with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of base storage. That extra 1GB of RAM might not sound like much, but it does make a noticeable impact, particularly if you like to play games or like to keep a lot of apps running in the background. The G Power features a simple, straightforward design with an 8-MP hole-punch selfie camera in the top left corner, a smallish chin down below, and a plastic back (available in silver or gray). The centerpiece is a large, 6.8-inch LCD display with 1600 x 720 resolution. Now, it’s hard to get really upset about a $200 phone featuring a 720p display, but I still wish Moto had found room in the budget to go full HD. With a pixel density of around 266 PPI spread across a 6.8-inch display, people with decent eyesight will probably notice some jagged lines and things won’t look all that sharp. Thankfully, colors appear relatively bright and vivid, and while the G Power’s 500-nit screen can look a bit dim when viewed outside in direct sunlight, there’s not much else to complain about.Like all good budget phones, the G Power comes with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and a microSD card slot, so you can easily add on extra storage and hold onto your beloved wired headphones. And while the G Power doesn’t have an official water resistance rating, Moto says the phone does have a water-repellant design, which, as you can in one of the photos above, was able to withstand getting shoved into the snow port first. The G Power has a couple of quirks that I don’t love. Instead of the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor you get on the G Play, Moto used a side-mounted reader built into its power button. In normal use, it’s just as fast and accurate as a rear-mounted version, but it could be annoying for lefties. The other, more troubling issue is that the G Power doesn’t have NFC, which means you can’t use a lot of payment apps, including Google Pay. If you’re planning to buy the G Power for a child or teenager, that might be a good thing. But I’m not really a fan of skimping on what has basically become an industry standard feature nowadays just to save a buck.The G Power sports a triple-lens rear camera module comprised of a 48-MP main cam, a 2-MP macro cam, and a 2-MP depth cam to help with portrait-style shots. To me, the 2-MP macro is a fun addition, but because it’s not something most people will use everyday, it feels a little gimmicky. I would have greatly preferred either an ultra-wide camera or something with a small zoom.As for the 48-MP main cam, in well-lit conditions, its photos are generally respectable, capturing photos with sharp details and bright colors, even if Moto’s white balance tends to skew a bit warm. However, as the amount of available light goes down, so does the G Power’s image quality. For example, even in a shot taken indoors near a window with lots of light, the G Power’s photo looks noticeably grainier than a similar shot taken with the Pixel 4a. Granted, the Pixel 4a costs $100 to $150 more than the G Power (depending on the exact model), but it’s a good representation of the difference between a $200 phone and a $350 phone. And while Moto does have its own Night Vision mode for real dark conditions, it just doesn’t compare well to Google’s Night Sight mode, with the G Power’s pics often lacking a lot of detail and sharpness.Finally, when it comes to battery life, the G Power definitely lives up to its name, lasting 16 hours and 22 minutes on our video rundown test. That’s better than the standard version of the iPhone 12 (14:20) and the Galaxy S21 (12:36), and not far off the battery life offered from Apple and Samsung’s super expensive premium phones, the iPhone 12 Pro Max (16:31) and Galaxy S21 Ultra (16:45). And in more realistic conditions, I found that the G Power easily lasted two, sometimes almost three days on a charge, so depending on how much you use your phone, you may only have to charge it a couple times a week. However, the downside to the G Power’s huge 5,000 mAh battery is that it charges relatively slowly, as it’s limited to the 10-watt charging with the power brick that comes in the box. (Moto does make a 15-watt Turbo Power charger, but it’s sold separately.)Now at this point, it might sound like I’m a bit down on the G Power, and the lack of NFC and a 720p resolution on a 6.8-inch screen certainly aren’t ideal. But overall, for a $200 device, the G Power offers surprisingly smooth performance, a solid build, and pretty decent cameras during the day. If you try to spend less than $200 on a phone, you seriously risk running into lag or stutter. And unlike a lot of budget devices, the G Power is delightfully free of bloat and other pre-loaded nonsense, and comes with a clean build of near stock Android, though it is Android 10 instead of 11. If you can afford it, the Pixel 4a is definitely a better phone. It’s got an OLED screen, a more powerful processor, and way better camera quality. But at the same time, upgrading to the Pixel 4a (or even something like the Nord N10 5G) is a pretty hefty price jump, and that kind of increase just isn’t going to fit in everyone’s budget. So if you’re looking for an affordable phone with beaucoup battery, for just two Benjamins, the G Power is a solid pick."
10,Samsung Galaxy S21,https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-s21-is-the-high-end-android-phone-to-bu-1846154811,"By launching its newest flagship earlier in the year than ever before, Samsung is making a statement with the Galaxy S21. I mean, just look at the rest of the premium Android phone market: LG is currently mulling the possibility of selling off its mobile division, OnePlus is joining forces with Oppo to help level up its handsets, and last year, Google skipped making a high-end phone entirely, and instead opted to straddle the line between mid-range and premium with the $700 Pixel 5. And that’s before you mention other previously big-time phone makers like HTC that are now basically on life support. The Galaxy S21 features a fresh new design, a beautiful upgraded display with a variable 120Hz refresh rate, a vastly improved fingerprint sensor, and a lower starting price of just $800. Even though Samsung has dropped a couple beloved features, the Galaxy S21 feels like even more of a no-brainer for anyone looking to buy a premium Android phone.Love it or hate it, the S21's redesigned chassis is certainly unique, and it comes with a few notable advantages when it comes to durability. With its new Contour Cut camera module, Samsung was able to combine the S21's camera housing with the rest of the phone’s metal chassis, which should offer increased durability and help avoid the cracked glass that some people experienced with the Galaxy S20. And in a departure from so many premium phones, instead of using Gorilla Glass 7 in front and back (like you get on the S21 Ultra), the standard S21's back is made from plastic. So if you drop it, you might get left with a dent, but the body shouldn’t spider-web into a million spiky shards.With its 6.2-inch display, new matte back, and the added lightness you get from plastic, I feel like the S21 offers the perfect combination between size and usability. Even for someone with medium-sized hands, the S21 never feels cumbersome or unwieldy, and unless you’re a big mobile video watcher, there’s plenty of room to watch content. If you love big-screen phones, you can always upgrade to the S21+, which features a 6.7-inch display, though I haven’t had a chance to check out the larger model out in person yet.The biggest upgrade on the S21, though, is Samsung’s new VRR display, which can now dynamically adjust its refresh rate between 120Hz (for stuff like gaming) or lower its refresh rate to as low as 40Hz (for when you’re looking at photos). This is a huge upgrade from the S20, which was locked at 120Hz, and it allows the S21 to deliver the best, most fluid looking visuals when you need them or drop its refresh rate down when you don’t to help save on battery life. The result is that even if you’re just scrolling through social media, text flows up and down like a river. It’s like a massage for your eyeballs. And with excellent brightness that hit 850 nits on our tests, along with rich, saturated colors, the S21's display is unmatched among phones (aside from the S21 Ultra’s display, which has an even more sophisticated version of Samsung’s 120Hz tech).However, as good as the S21's screen is, it does come with a trade-off—the resolution has actually decreased from last year, down to 2400 x 1080. Under most circumstances you can’t tell, but if you really go pixel peeping or have excellent eyesight, you may notice a tiny bit less sharpness than before. But as much as I wish Samsung didn’t compromise, I do have to admit that given the choice between slightly higher resolution or the S21's new  screen, I’m going to take that all 120Hz of VRR goodness. Beneath the glass, the S21's in-screen fingerprint reader has also gotten a big upgrade with a new sensor. It might not look much bigger from the size of the icon, but it’s actually 1.7 times larger than before. The speed of the sensor  feels noticeably faster, which is enough to turn a feature that many still think is somewhat underwhelming into a bonafide highlight. Honestly, if all in-screen fingerprint sensors were this good, no one would want to go back to the old rear-mounted digit scanners.Samsung even refined tiny details: removing the controversial rounded edges used on previous Galaxy phones and thinning down the S21's bezels but still keeping enough room for the tiny sliver that is the S21's earpiece, which is nestled just above its 10-MP selfie cam.With the S21's rear camera, which features the same sensors as before (12-MP main, 12-MP ultra-wide, and 64-MP telephoto with a 3x optical zoom), Samsung has borrowed Google’s strategy of sticking with the same components but improving the S21's algorithms and camera processing. In the real world, this means the S21 offers more accurate white balance and a more powerful night mode, with Samsung even tacking on a bunch of new and revamped camera features. So in addition to a brand new Portrait Mode with tools like studio lighting (which is replacing Samsung’s tired old Live Focus mode), there’s also a new Director’s View to help you film vlog-style videos (with controls for recording from both front and rear cams), and even a revamped Single Take mode that can film slow-mo clips while snapping up to 10 different pics in one second.But the real takeaway I had after testing the S21 head-to-head against the Pixel 5 is that Samsung has essentially caught up with Google’s image processing, while also providing a wider range of lenses and adjustable features. In a photo of some sushi, you can see the advantages of Samsung’s scene optimizer, which captured warmer and frankly more appetizing colors, without losing much, if any detail. Same goes for a shot I took of graffiti, where the S21 more accurately corrected the cool tones of a shot taken on a cloudy overcast day, resulting in a brighter and more colorful photo. And even at night where the Google’s low light Night Sight mode traditionally holds a significant advantage, the S21's pic was slightly grainer, but it’s arguably sharper and produced a final pic that doesn’t disappoint.Under the hood, as has become tradition for new Galaxy phones, Galaxy S21 models in the U.S. are the first handsets to feature Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 processor. When combined with a base 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, the S21's performance has hit a point where practically any kind of everyday task or app (even multiple apps) doesn’t pose much of a workout. That said, I do have to at least mention that on synthetic tests like Geekbench 5, Apple’s A14 chip still comes out on top, with the iPhone 12 posting multicore scores of 4,103 to the S21's mark of 3,528. Thankfully, in lieu of raw performance, the S21 can use its new chip for  other resource intensive tasks like 8K video recording, which is a welcome though somewhat niche upgrade. At this point, everything about the S21 sounds like a real treat thus far, but there are two other places where Samsung has backpedaled a bit. The first is the S21's battery life, which at 12 hours and 36 minutes on our battery test is barely above average. In more typical everyday use, I found the S21's endurance was still more than enough to last a whole day and then some. However, with the added energy efficiency provided by Qualcomm’s new silicon, I was  hoping for more.The other step back is one that might feel like a dealbreaker for longtime Galaxy fans. This year, Samsung has finally decided to axe microSD card expandability across the entire S21 lineup. This means no more adding on storage post purchase, or easily carrying over your huge music collection or photo roll via microSD from your previous Galaxy phone. The storage you have when you buy the phone is all you’ll ever get. The one small upside to this change, though, is that if you do want to upgrade to 256GB of storage, it only costs an extra $50, compared to an iPhone 12, which still comes with just 64GB of base storage and costs $150 to upgrade to 256GB. Finally, in a move that mirrors Apple’s decision to no longer include power adapters with the iPhone 12, Samsung is no longer bundling charging bricks too. It’s an annoying move, but like headphones jacks and microSD slots, bundled power adapters are becoming extinct, and it seems like there’s nothing we can do about it. Even with two small blips (or three depending on how you’re counting), the S21 is a beacon. It’s got possibly the most well-rounded set of features available on any phone available today, including a fancy new screen, revamped design, and support for 5G connectivity, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and more. But what puts the S21 over the top is that it starts at just $800—$100 less than what the S20 launched at last year and the same as an iPhone 12. That’s a really big deal, because right now (and for the foreseeable future), the S21's only real rival lies on the other side of the OS divide. Google, LG, and others don’t have anything that can really compete. That means for Android users looking for a truly high-end device, the Galaxy S21 is your default choice, and it’s damn hard to think of anything else I’d rather have for the money. "
11,Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-the-most-maxed-out-pho-1846097470,"Last year, Samsung broke out the “Ultra” adjective for the first time on the Galaxy S20 Ultra. That phone was certainly ambitious, but between its $1,400 price tag and features that didn’t quite live up to expectations, Samsung’s super premium phone felt less like an Ultra and more like a Galaxy S20++. In a move seemingly designed to make up for its predecessor’s somewhat lackluster showing in 2020, Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra has arrived. It’s packaged in a slick new design with quadruple rear cameras, and it’s packed with several features unmatched by practically any other phone on the market. Except now, Samsung’s super premium phone costs $200 less than last year’s model. The S21 Ultra isn’t just a big improvement. It’s an over-the-top, maxed out handset that combines all the features from the entire Galaxy range.Right off the bat, the S21 Ultra’s new design helps set the tone. The rear camera module extending into the side of the phone not only makes S21 Ultra feel less bulky, but it should also add some extra durability because the housing surrounding the phone’s camera lenses is now metal instead of glass. To balance the Ultra’s looks and toughness, Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass 7 on both sides, with the back getting a lovely matte finish. And while I’m still not sure if all the time Samsung claims it spent trying to choose the perfect shade of black was worth it, the S21 Ultra (at least in Phantom Black) has the kind of stealthy exterior that evokes favorable comparisons to the SR-71 Blackbird, the Batmobile, and others. Black on black is always a slick look, though the S21 Ultra is available in white, too, if that’s more your speed.Then there’s the S21 Ultra’s screen, which is a technicolor dream. I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating that at least for now, Samsung makes the best mobile displays in the world, and the S21 Ultra is the best new example of that. There’s a small, centrally located hole-punch cut-out for the phone’s 40-MP selfie cam. But aside from that, it’s pretty much an unblemished 3200 x 1440 6.8-inch swatch of beautiful AMOLED pixels, with a slight but not distracting curve around its edges and a tiny hint of bezel that helps mask small features like the almost invisible earpiece piece up top.Samsung’s big display upgrade for the Ultra is the addition of the  variable refresh rate tech it debuted on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. The change not only gives the S21 Ultra a screen that can hit 120Hz, but also the ability to dynamically change its refresh rate depending on the content you’re currently looking at. If you’re looking at a still photo, the S21 Ultra can lower its refresh rate down to just 10Hz to help save on battery. Or if you’re watching a video, the S21 Ultra’s display can match the clip’s frame rate. When you’re playing a game, boost things up to 120Hz for the optimal viewing experience. And if you’re just browsing the web, the S21 Ultra’s higher refresh rate makes everything look extra smooth. Of all ways VRR can be applied, that’s the one that makes the biggest impact to me. Samsung nailed the most important qualities of a good screen: It’s vivid, bright, and responsive. No other phone can match the S21 Ultra’s combo of quality and refresh rate. More than ever, I’m convinced every high-end phone should have a 120Hz display—no excuses. On top of that, the S21 Ultra is now stealing some more of the Galaxy Note’s thunder with support for a couple different optional S-Pens. So even though you don’t have a place to stash the pen in the body of the phone (unless you get one of Samsung’s new cases too), you can get the same drawing and note-taking experience on a Galaxy S handset for the first time, which is always a nice choice to have. I didn’t get to test it out myself because S-Pen support isn’t available yet.Another big improvement that might not get a lot of attention is the S21 Ultra’s new in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is not only 1.7 times larger than the S20 Ultra’s, it also feels way faster. Ever since phone makers started switching over to in-screen fingerprint sensors, a lot of people have tolerated them while sometimes remarking they wanted the old-school rear-mounted sensors back. However, after years of refinement, the S21 Ultra’s in-screen fingerprint reader is undoubtedly a perk, and in a time when facial recognition is a bust whenever I’m outside, I find myself appreciating the S21 Ultra’s new sensor even more. On the inside, U.S. models of the S21 Ultra come with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip with 12GB of RAM and 128GB of base storage. Unfortunately, Samsung decided to ditch the microSD card slot from the entire lineup of 2021 Galaxy S phones. For some, this may be the last straw in their list of grievances against Samsung, but the reality is that this is simply the direction smartphones are moving as a whole, just like the removal of headphone jacks paved the way for mainstream wireless audio.My bigger gripe is that with the removal of microSD expandability, I wish Samsung had opted to include 256GB of base storage instead of 128GB, to help smooth this transition. It would be nice for buyers to feel less of a need to shell out for extra storage, especially with Samsung’s top-tier device. That said, moving up to 256GB costs just $50 instead of the $100 premium many that many other phone makers typically charge.Meanwhile, even though the Snapdragon 888 can’t quite match the benchmark numbers put up by the Apple’s A14 chip in the iPhone 12 (3,614 for the S21 Ultra vs 4,261 for the iPhone 12 Pro Max in Geekbench 5's Multicore CPU test), I never noticed a hint of lag or slowdown while using the S21 Ultra. At least in my experience, while Apple’s latest chip has theoretically better performance, there isn’t much you can throw at a phone today that the Snapdragon 888 can’t handle with ease.But around back is easily my favorite new addition to the S21 Ultra’s arsenal: its new quadruple rear cams. That’s because in addition to a 108-MP main cam and 12-MP ultra-wide cam, the S21 Ultra has two telephoto cams: one with a 3x optical zoom and one with a 10x optical zoom. Last year, Samsung branded the S20 Ultra’s setup with the overzealous Space Zoom moniker, which seemed kind of silly. But on the S21 Ultra, Samsung really means it this time, because space is exactly what this telephoto camera combo delivers. Don’t focus on the marketing claims of up to 100x zoom—that’s meaningless because you can crop in on almost any picture to digitally pump up the zoom. It’s the S21 Ultra’s 3x and 10x optical zoom that really matter because it gives you reach you can actually use.When I turned the S21 Ultra up to 10x while pointing the camera at the NYC skyline, the Empire State building remained delightfully sharp even from nearly four miles away. And thanks to Samsung’s new Zoom Lock feature—which uses AI to make the camera’s viewfinder more stable—I was able to take that shot handheld instead of needing to strap the phone to a tripod. As someone who loves the versatility of zoom lenses on big DSLRs and mirrorless cameras, the S21 Ultra feels like the first phone that can offer a similar experience on mobile. As I was testing it out, I was cursing the pandemic even more than usual for robbing me of more opportunities to use that 10x zoom. And even when you don’t need that much reach, the S21 Ultra’s shorter 3x optical zoom still trounced the algorithmically-enhanced 3x Super Res Zoom on the Pixel 5. The camera upgrades don’t stop there either, because the S21 Ultra also includes a dedicated laser autofocus sensor that eliminates the soft-focus the S20 Ultra sometimes ran into. And while Samsung’s image processing tends to result in slightly warmer hues than what you get from a Pixel 5, the S21 Ultra tended to capture photos with colors that looked more accurate to my eye and how they looked in real life. But the big surprise to me is that thanks to an improved Night Mode, some of the S21 Ultra’s super low light shots came out even better than Google’s vaunted Night Sight mode. For instance, the yarn in the No Face pic looks significantly sharper than what I got from the Pixel 5.Additionally, thanks in part to the S21's increased processing power, a number of the S21 Ultra’s other camera modes have seen significant improvements. The fun social media-friendly Single Take mode has the ability to capture slow-mo clips and snap up to 10 frames per second (up from 2-3 fps last year), and a new Portrait Mode feature is frankly a big upgrade from Samsung’s old and tired Live Focus mode. You can even record videos in 8K if you want, or capture 8K stills while recording, though I did notice that very occasionally 4K and 8K videos suffered from a sort of oversharpening that caused faint moire-like patterns to appear.Finally, because the S21 Ultra is powered by a huge 5,000 mAh battery, I got some of the best runtimes I’ve seen a Galaxy S phone ever. On our video rundown test, the S21 Ultra lasted 16 hours and 45 minutes. The only phones we tested in 2020 that beat that mark were the Moto Edge+ (17:18), and the Asus ROG Phone 3 (16:56), the latter of which came with a monstrous 6,000 mAh power pack. In the end, it all boils down to this: While Samsung axing microSD card expandability is certainly regrettable, the S21 Ultra has the best screen, the longest (and most usable) zoom cam, and the best in-screen fingerprint reader you can get on a phone today. And it costs $200 less than last year’s “Ultra” phone, or $100 less than its premium sibling, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. Then, when you factor in all the little upgrades and features, including wireless and reverse wireless charging, improved photo processing, all the enhanced camera modes, and forward-thinking inclusions like  UWB support, to me, the S21 Ultra feels like the maxed out, feature-packed phone that’s finally making good on so much of Samsung’s big talk over the last couple years. So while the iPhone 12 Pro Max might have slightly better performance, the S21 Ultra is the phone to beat."
12,iPhone 12 mini,https://gizmodo.com/i-love-the-iphone-12-mini-but-the-battery-is-killing-m-1845721516,"When Apple released the second-gen iPhone SE earlier this year, I thought it was pretty good for the price. But what I longed for, I wrote in my SE review, was an iPhone 12 Pro Mini: an almost bezel-free, pint-sized phone with incredible cameras and an in-display fingerprint sensor for $400. Apple checked some of those boxes with the iPhone 12 Mini, but also left me wanting more.First thing’s first: The Mini is the perfect size. I’m a petite person with small hands, and though I’ve begrudgingly accepted that smartphones are just large now, the Mini’s 5.4-inch display and 5.18-inch-long frame are so much easier for me to use than every other phone—yes, iPhone 12 Pro Max, I am glaring at you. And though the Mini is not $400 (that one really was too much to ask for) and it doesn’t have an in-display fingerprint sensor, it does indeed have very good cameras. They’re the same cameras that you’ll find in the larger iPhone 12.But the iPhone 12 Mini has its flaws, and despite how comfortable it is to use, I find myself drifting to the other iPhones in this year’s lineup.I have now reviewed every iPhone 12. They have a lot in common. We’ve been over 5G (usually a little faster than LTE, but good luck finding the gigabit speeds that have been much hyped this year!). We’ve discussed the A14 Bionic (the fastest chip in any smartphone!). We’ve covered MagSafe charging (it’s...fine!). And the throwback redesign is now well-trodden territory (but extremely good!). Check out my iPhone 12, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max reviews for deeper drives into those topics.So now we’ve arrived at the iPhone 12 Mini, the cutest phone I’ve ever reviewed—and I don’t say that lightly. Two years ago I was inexplicably smitten with Sony’s Xperia Z2 Compact, a tiny Android phone that stole my heart. The 12 Mini is like a smartphone that graduated with a master’s degree but never grew another inch after junior high. It’s advanced and small. I identify with it very strongly.I switched to the 12 Mini after using the 12 Pro Max, and the difference is truly night and day. This is actually the first iPhone I’ve ever used without a case. Mainly because it fits so well in my hands and pockets. (And with the same Ceramic Shield front glass as the other iPhones 12, I’m less concerned I’ll shatter the thing by dropping it.)The trade-off for a smaller body is, well, a smaller screen. The Max is a great phone for getting work done with its expansive 6.7-inch display, but I also have to stick it in a bag or wear a jacket to ensure I have enough room to tote it around. The Mini may not be the best phone for editing blogs in Kinja, but that’s alright: I have other, larger devices for that purpose.OK, OK, I’ve made my point. You get it. I love the 12 Mini’s mini-ness.I thought I might have to sacrifice camera quality for size, as I did with the iPhone SE, but the Mini has the exact same camera system as the iPhone 12. That means you get a rear set-up with a standard 12-megapixel wide-angle lens and 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens—both with Night Mode—and a 12MP TrueDepth front-facing lens. The 12 and 12 Mini don’t have a telephoto lens and aren’t capable of taking Night Portraits, which is kind of a bummer—I’d prefer a telephoto over the ultra-wide-angle any day. But they still take great photos in most situations.I compared the 12 Mini to the iPhone SE, which has a single 12-megapixel lens but lacks Apple’s software-based image-processing feature, Deep Fusion, or a Night Mode, and to the Pixel 5, which has a dual-lens shooter and Night Mode but is larger than the 12 Mini. Check out the comparisons below.The 12 Mini takes incredibly natural photos with its main lens, and the colors and details are slightly better than the SE, thanks to Deep Fusion. Some might prefer the Pixel 5's images, but to me the colors are overdramatic, particularly in the nighttime shot of an orange tree and streetlamp.If there’s one spot where the Pixel 5 and iPhone SE both fail miserably here, it’s low-light Portrait shots. The 12 Mini isn’t capable of low-light Portraits, so it won’t apply a bokeh effect if there isn’t enough light, but it still handles the shot better than the SE and the Pixel 5, which overly smooths your images if there isn’t enough light. The 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max are the phones to buy if Night Portraits are important to you.As you can see, the 12 Mini is not a 12 Pro Mini, but it also is perfectly capable when it comes to photography. And it’s leaps and bounds beyond the iPhone SE, which somehow launched just a few months ago but also in another lifetime.But as a fan of small phones, my biggest concern also turned out to be my biggest problem with the 12 Mini: battery life. I squeezed out 11 hours and 20 minutes on our video rundown test—three hours less than the iPhone 12, and five hours and 11 minutes less than the 12 Pro Max. It hurts, truly. It’s likely because the iPhone 12 Mini uses a tiny 2,227 mAh battery according to an iFixit teardown. By comparison, the iPhone 12 uses a 2,815 mAh battery, and the iPhone 12 Pro Max appears to have a 3,687 mAh battery.Aside from testing, my anecdotal battery observations were...not good. On one day of slightly more than normal use—the group chats were a little more active than usual—I was down to 10% just after dinner. “Well,” I thought, “I guess I am a heavy user.”But aren’t we all? I use my phone for the same things everyone else does: texting, streaming music and podcasts, mindlessly scrolling Instagram, checking Twitter after I’ve closed it on my desktop to focus, etc. I need a phone that can easily last all day, not one that has to be topped up before I go out at night (lol OK so that’s not happening anymore, but one day!). And this battery drain is all happening on wifi—heaven forbid the 12 Mini gets close to a millimeter-wave 5G node and can suddenly tap gigabit speeds. It’ll be toast.I am the target market for this phone. I wanted to love it. But despite its size and its downright affordable price tag when you consider the performance and camera quality, the iPhone 12 Mini is a phone for people who either don’t use their phones often enough throughout the day to stress about battery life or who carry a battery pack with them wherever they go. The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are the iPhones the rest of us should buy."
13,iPhone 12 Pro,https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-12-pro-max-is-entirely-too-much-phone-but-i-1845649078,"I wish I had never used the iPhone 12 Pro Max.It is not a bad device. The opposite, in fact: It’s so good that this is the iPhone I want to use every day except for the fact that it’s so fucking massive. This isn’t a bad thing when I am reading or watching videos or composing emails. It’s just when I have to tote it around that I remember that the Pro Max is, well, max. Everything about it is extra as hell: The 6.7-inch display is huge and the phone itself with its stainless steel frame is heavy—a full ounce and a half heavier than the iPhone 12 Pro. I can’t use it one-handed for basically any task, and I cling to it for dear life on morning runs outside because the flat edges make me feel like I’m about to drop it, even when cased. It fits into absolutely none of my clothing pockets—though I will acknowledge that women’s clothes are not, in fact, designed to be useful in any way, so it’s not surprising that the Max doesn’t fit in my Levis (front or back).Look, this is a battle I’ve lost. Phones are big now. And I’m not going to dock the 12 Pro Max for being sizable. Compared to Samsung’s 6.9-inch Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, the Max is positively petite (and way easier to grip than that beast, besides).On paper, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the best iPhone. In practice, it’s the best iPhone. But whether this is the iPhone you actually want to buy depends on whether you can get over its size, heft, and price. I’m this close to being over all three, and I’m a little mad about it.I’ve already reviewed the iPhone 12 (the best iPhone for most people), the iPhone 12 Pro (the almost perfect iPhone), and I’m in the process of reviewing the iPhone 12 Mini (by far the cutest iPhone), so I’ll spare you a rehash of what the four have in common. We’ve been over the redesign that harkens back to the iPhones of yore, we’ve talked about the promises and pains of 5G, we’ve put the A14 Bionic through its paces, and we’ve explored MagSafe charging’s ease and limitations. What sets the iPhone 12 Pro Max apart, aside from its size, is its cameras and its battery life.Like the 12 Pro, the Pro Max sports a wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto lens, with LiDAR scanner. The difference is in the wide (or standard) and telephoto lenses: The Pro Max’s wide-angle primary lens has a 47% larger sensor, with what Apple calls sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which is meant to reduce shakiness and allow you to shoot low-light images with less exposure time. I found that to be true—nighttime shots that require 3-second exposures on the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro required just two seconds on the 12 Pro Max. I noticed a slight but not dramatic difference in Night Mode shots between the 12, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max, as you can see in the shot below of a hibiscus bush with a distant streetlamp the only light source. The flowers and leaves were less detailed on the 11 Pro Max, and the Pixel 5's Night Sight turned out a blurry shot, despite the fact that I was totally still and holding my breath.The LiDAR scanner makes the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max capable of Night Portraits, but this is where things get interesting. As you can see in the portraits of me on my front porch below, lit from the front by the light from my living room and from behind by an office building down the street, the 12 Pro Max resulted in a perfectly decent, warmly lit photo, but the iPhone 12 holds its own. The 12's portraits are zoomed out because of its use of a wide and ultra-wide-angle lens, but both the light and the bokeh effect around my hair are more natural. The Pixel 5's night portraits are also good, though artificially smooth. The 11 Pro Max’s night portrait is a grainy mess, so as you can see, the iPhone’s cameras have been dramatically improved year-over-year.Aside from the changes to the wide-angle lens’s sensor, Apple also lengthened the Pro Max’s telephoto lens from the 52mm f/2.2 found in the 12 Pro to 65mm f/2.0. This means you get 2.5x optical zoom with the Max, as opposed to the 2x optical zoom on the Pro. The improved lens results in clearer, more zoomed-in photos, as you can see in the shots below of the Hollywood sign from Runyon Canyon a few miles away. The iPhone 12 and Pixel 5's digital zooms are no match for an optical zoom. But Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the clear winner with its 5x optical zoom, which results in incredibly detailed photos. (Too bad it’s also $1,300 and a freakin’ monster of a phone.)But in a more challenging shot of light reflecting off the Pacific Ocean just beyond Century City, the Note 20 Ultra’s optical zoom didn’t result in a more amazing shot, because you lose a lot of detail in the skyline. (The 12 Pro is my favorite of the five in this instance.)Though the Pixel 5 takes great portraits, even at night, and the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s 5x optical zoom is *chef’s kiss* in the perfect light, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the best smartphone camera for most situations. But the 12 Pro is almost as good, and the 12 holds its own—except when you need those zoomed-in shots.Is the iPhone 12 Pro Max worth spending an extra $100 over the Pro just for slightly better night photos and slightly better telephoto lens? No. But the cameras are good! My only issue is the same issue I have with every other iPhone: that damn  green lens flare that occasionally occurs when light refracts off the camera (as you can see in the Portrait Mode shot in the last slide below). Of course you never notice when you take the shot so you can do it again. It’s only after—when you pinch to zoom in and notice a giant dot on your turtleneck—do you curse audibly. But I digress.The 12 Pro Max’s gigantic size means it has room for a bigger battery. This is important because 5G can suck the life out of your device—if you ever come near a millimeter-wave node stuck to a building or a cell tower somewhere. That’s the only way you’ll get the gigabit speeds Apple hyped during its iPhone event in October. But that’s OK, because the 12 Pro Max’s bigger battery is meaningful right now, even if 5G isn’t quite so much.The 12 Pro Max lasted 16 hours and 31 minutes in our video rundown test—that’s more than two hours longer than both the iPhone 12 (14:20) and 12 Pro (14:10), and easily tops the Note 20 Ultra (14:23) and the entire S20 lineup (which range from 14:40 to 15:56). Google’s Pixel 5 eked out an extra 18 minutes but is nowhere near as fully featured as the 12 Pro Max in any other department.Not only does the 12 Pro Max last longer than its little siblings in the iPhone 12 lineup, but it also is the top-performing phone of the four. Every iPhone 12 has an A14 Bionic processor, but the 12 Pro Max makes the most of it—in synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench 5, the 12 Pro Max’s multi-core score (4,261) rivals that of the fourth-gen iPad Air (4,264), which also packs in an A14 Bionic. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which sports Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 chip, pales in comparison with a multi-core score of 3,299, as does, well, literally every other smartphone on the market. There’s no competition here.And I do have to credit Apple for the Pro Max’s design—while it looks just like a 12 Pro but larger, I can’t deny the gold version with gleaming trim and matte champagne-hued back glass is both gorgeous and more impressive in the bigger size.  The 6.7-inch Retina XDR display makes the 12 Pro Max a touch bigger than the 11 Pro Max, which, again, is annoying because this phone is so large, but it really is a dream to work on. As I ventured out to Runyon Canyon to shoot photos, I found myself on the top of a hill with incoming Slack messages pinging me for edits. I was able to quickly log into Kinja, edit two news blogs, publish them, and change their status in our editorial tracking system, Airtable, with just a couple bars of 5G signal. If I was doing more work on the go, as I did in the Before Times, the Pro Max would be a serious contender.Some have remarked on the 12 Pro Max’s 60 Hz display when competing Android flagships have bumped up to 90 Hz or even 120 Hz. Look, I love Samsung’s screens. I think they’re the best in the business. But I don’t think most people will buy a new iPhone and think to themselves: “This scrolling could be so much smoother.” Would it be nice to have? Sure, but it’s not such a dramatic improvement that it feels like Apple missed the boat.I really do like the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but I’m still stuck on its size. I’m mainly working from home, and when I do venture outside, I want to be able to stick my phone in my pocket, grab my mask, and get out the door. The Pro Max makes that a little more difficult, at least for me.If you are a tall, large-handed person with literal deep pockets, this is the iPhone for you. It’s better than the other iPhones 12 in just about every way. But it’s not so much better if you are a smaller person for whom comfort and ease of use are a priority when choosing a smartphone. You shouldn’t sacrifice those things. The iPhone 12 Pro is much more manageable, and the cameras are almost as good."
14,Pixel 4a 5g,https://gizmodo.com/the-pixel-4a-5g-is-hands-down-the-best-500-phone-1845514452,"The Pixel 4a 5G is an interesting phone, because on the outside it’s as plain as can be. But just like the Millennium Falcon, she’s got it where it counts. The Pixel 4a 5G is also somewhat awkwardly named, having more in common with the Pixel 5 than its smaller sibling, the standard Pixel 4a. So even though I want to call it the Pixel 5 Lite with its largish 6.2-inch OLED screen, that’s not quite right either. However, titles and names aside, I can tell you that on the Pixel 4a 5G, Google has smartly allocated resources toward the features and components that really matter, and the result is a nearly ideal $500 phone.Clad in black plastic with a white power button as its only major distinguishing characteristic, the Pixel 4a 5G is an exceedingly simple device. There’s no configurations to choose, nor are there alternate colors like the Pixel 5's Sorta Sage, which is a bit sad, but ultimately logical when you remember most people are just going to throw this thing in a case. Around the edge of the phone there’s a thinnish black bezel, with a hole-punch cut-out for an 8-MP selfie cam, a tiny earpiece speaker embedded in the top bezel, a USB-C port on bottom (next to another speaker), and square camera module in back above a good ‘ole fingerprint reader. Oh yeah, and there’s a headphone jack. It’s nothing fancy, but Google covered all the bases and everything works as expected, and that’s what matters. The Pixel 4a 5G differs from the standard Pixel 4a in three main areas. First, it’s got a larger 2340 x 1080 6.2-inch OLED display, up from 5.8 inches, which is important for anyone who wants more room to watch movies or play games. Meanwhile, with a peak brightness of over 700 nits and the deep, saturated colors that make OLED screens so pleasing, the Pixel 4a 5G feels like a great balance between delivering more content without making the phone too big or unwieldy.Second, it’s got a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, which is not only the same as what you get in the Pixel 5, it also brings 5G support, so even if you don’t have 5G in your area right now, the phone will be ready to deliver faster mobile speeds when you do. On a mid-range phone in 2020, the 765G offers an excellent sweet spot for price and performance, and in my experience, the Pixel 4a 5G almost never suffered from stutter or lag. Google even doubled the base storage to 128GB, which really should be the starting point for most phones today (cough iPhone 12), and is a very much appreciated move to keep pace with the times.One interesting thing to note is that despite the Pixel 4a 5G’s larger 3,800 mAh battery, its  longevity is almost exactly the same as its smaller sibling, lasting 13 hours and 57 minutes on a charge (compared to 13:55 for the Pixel 4a). That’s not a bad time at all, besting the OnePlus 8T (13:49), but I was sort of expecting a bit more.Third, and more importantly, the Pixel 4a 5G gets two rear cameras instead of one: a 12.2-MP main cam and a 16-MP ultra-wide. Compared to the $700 Pixel 5, I’m much less bothered about Google not including a zoom cam, and when you factor in Google’s Super Res Zoom (which uses software to improve typical digital zoom shots), the addition of an ultra-wide cam makes a ton of sense. But the real win for the Pixel 4a 5G is that by giving a $500 phone essentially the same image quality you get on the Pixel 5, no other phones in this price range can really compete. It’s basically cheating. When I tested the Pixel 4a 5G against the Moto One, the Pixel swept the board in every scenario—both bright light and low light. Colors were bright, dynamic range was better, and small details like the texture on flowers and skin on the pumpkin were sharper. And in low light, while all of the Moto One’s pics sported slightly washed out colors, the Pixel 4a 5G’s were richer without being overbearing.The main things missing from the Pixel 4a 5G compared to the Pixel 5 are wireless charging and an IP68 rating for water resistance, both of which would be nice, but they’re not dealbreakers. Technically, the Pixel 4a 5G also lacks the aluminum frame used in the Pixel 5, though because the 4a 5G still feels quite sturdy and the Pixel 5's chassis is hidden beneath Google’s special “bio-resin,” you can’t really tell either way.The Pixel 4a 5G’s most important components are some of the best you can get for the money. It’s got a big OLED screen when almost every other phone in the price range is using LCD. It offers strong performance and full 5G support. And its cameras are straight up unmatched. And then there’s the Pixel experience, which ensures you get day one Android updates, three years of support, and nifty software tricks like Call Screener, Duplex, the Pixel Recorder, and more. The Pixel 4a 5G might not be a looker or have the rugged charm of a scruffy nerf herder, but if you need a smartphone you can depend on, the Pixel 4a 5G is what you (and your wallet) needs. "
15,iPhone 12 pro,https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-12-pro-is-dare-i-say-it-a-near-perfect-pho-1845498369,"Phones are expensive. Most people upgrade every few generations, and they want a phone that will take great photos, support the latest software, and won’t shit the bed after just a couple years.The iPhone 12 Pro is $1,000. I wish flagship phones were cheaper, but for the price, the 12 Pro is future-proofed for years to come, with 5G connectivity that will enable much faster speeds—even if it’s not constantly pulling down gigabit speeds right now—an incredibly powerful processor, excellent cameras, and a goddamn gorgeous design.The iPhone 12 Pro has a lot of competition. Samsung makes excellent hardware, but its software and image processing can be wonky, and the company’s pricing is all over the place. Samsung’s $1,000 Galaxy Note 20 has a stylus but [checks notes] a plastic back. Come on. The $1,000 Galaxy S20 feels a little higher-end, but you have to buy a different variation if you want support for Verizon’s mmWave 5G network because the original S20 only supports low-band spectrum. Meanwhile, Google’s hardware is weird as hell. The new Pixel 5 is $700 but should cost much less, because it feels  and looks cheap, even with a more modern hole-punch front-facing camera. I get that the iPhone notch is still polarizing, but I accept that as a trade-off for more secure facial recognition. Google’s software is overall good, but its cameras are no longer pulling their weight.Yet the 12 Pro’s biggest rival isn’t anything Android-based. It’s the $800 iPhone 12, which has most of the same features for $200 less. Is it worth shelling out the extra cash for a better camera and more premium design? This could be contentious in this climate, but yes. Yes, it is.Here’s where I have to say: If you read the headline and clicked just to immediately scroll down to the comments and tell me which phone is better than this one, hold your horses. If you hate iOS, the iPhone 12 Pro will not convince you otherwise. If you have a newish iPhone (say, the 11 Pro), there’s no need to drop everything and upgrade. But if you are cool with the Apple ecosystem and have an older iPhone—say a 7 or 8—I highly recommend the iPhone 12 Pro. It is worth the money.“But wait,” you might be thinking, “What about the 12 Pro Max? Won’t that be a more perfect iPhone than this iPhone?”Possibly! The Pro Max does have better camera specs, but I haven’t used it yet. For me personally, as a petite person with small hands, the iPhone Max tends to be uncomfortably tall to use one-handed and does not fit in any of my pockets, but I will render my verdict when the Max debuts next month. If you prefer a larger phone, you might want to wait. I don’t know your life! But I do know that most people will love the 12 Pro.Let’s start with the design: The 12 Pro shares the same flat-edged, iPhone 4-like aesthetic as the iPhone 12, which evokes nostalgia for days when new smartphones were extremely exciting. The 12 Pro has a stainless steel frame that makes it much heavier than the aluminum 12, and also has a matte glass back that is fairly resistant to fingerprint smudges. (The 12, bless its heart, is incredibly glossy.) The Pacific Blue shade I’ve been using is subtle and really, really beautiful—so nice that I want to use it sans case, but I won’t, because I know my limitations. Apple included a more shatter-resistant Ceramic Shield front glass throughout the iPhone 12 lineup, but I’m not out here trying to live dangerously. The 6.1-inch Retina XDR (OLED) display is beautiful, and while I was concerned that the bigger screen size would translate to a larger phone footprint, this year’s Pro is the same size as last year’s.Then there are the cameras, which improve upon the base iPhone 12's with a telephoto lens and LiDAR scanner. More on that in a second.Some iPhone reviewers have remarked on the futility of upgrading your smartphone camera when everyone is stuck inside due to the pandemic. I hate to be the one to say it, but, uh, people are no longer staying inside. Many of us are still working from home, but my scientific analysis of Instagram tells me that outdoor dining is in full swing, kids across the country are back in school, and people are getting ready for the holidays. We are all just trying to live our lives in this truly horrible timeline, and we want good cameras to capture the few joyful memories 2020 may bring. (This is not a judgment on whether or not lockdown should still be in full effect as covid-19 cases continue to climb; I am just stating facts and am in no position to implement or affect public health policy.)That said, the 12 Pro’s triple-lens array is an excellent camera setup for social distancing. The front-facing camera takes much better low-light selfies, and the new LiDAR scanner improves low-light autofocus by up to six times. The entire 12 lineup also supports low-light time-lapses, as you can see with this 12 Pro video of the sunset over the Pacific.These improved low-light and Night Mode features are perfect, because it’s about to be dark AF before the workday even ends. I fully plan to torture my friends back on the East Coast with regular photographic reminders that in Los Angeles it is summer year-round. (And also that I miss traveling to see them and vice versa.)Check out some low-light selfies and Night Mode shots, including portraits, below.The iPhone 12 supports low-light selfies, too, but it doesn’t have the 12 Pro’s faster autofocus, nor does it shoot Portrait Mode at night (another feature enabled by the LiDAR scanner). To be honest, the 12's low-light portraits are actually not bad—the 12 Pro’s are better, sure, but the difference isn’t night-and-day. But the 12 Pro’s telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom is a bigger deal. The 12 has no LiDAR, no telephoto lens, and can only zoom in 5x. (The Pro Max sports an even more impressive telephoto lens with f/2.2 aperture for 2.5x optical zoom and 12x digital zoom.) The telephoto lens makes a difference when you want to shoot, say, friends or family members sitting six feet apart at an outdoor picnic or something like that.I tested the 12 Pro’s zoom capabilities against the Pixel 5's Super Res Zoom, the iPhone 12's digital zoom, the 11 Pro and the Galaxy Note 20's telephoto lenses with an architectural shot of the Capitol Records building in Hollywood (zoomed in 2x for all phones). They all fared pretty evenly, as you would expect phones at this price to cost, though the 12 and 12 Pro reproduce colors more naturally to my eye.I also pitted the five phones against one another with a 4x zoom shot of the Hollywood sign, which is where differences really start to become apparent. There’s a ton of detail in the iPhone 12 Pro shot, while the 12 is a bit flatter and the Pixel 5 even more so (which makes sense, because both have digital zooms).The results were a little more even when shooting from the ultrawide-angle lens on all the phones in broad daylight.Now that you’ve seen how the cameras stack up to the competition, check out some samples of just the iPhone 12 Pro in action.Apple is really trying to make augmented reality a thing, which is what the LiDAR scanner is presumably really for, but I find using my phone to scan my surroundings and then viewing AR objects overlaid on top of reality back on my phone... boring. I use AR primarily to entertain my nieces and nephews when they won’t stop asking me to show them videos of baby animals hatching on YouTube (an incredibly educational subgenre of YouTube, to be sure, but a person can only take so much), but I haven’t seen them in quite some time, so I haven’t been able to dazzle them with the new iPhone. Its AR capability just doesn’t do it for me—at least not yet.The entire iPhone 12 lineup can shoot video in Dolby Vision, but with the Pro models, that extends all the way up to 4K 60fps (it stops short at 4K 30fps for the 12 and 12 Mini). Instead of showing you a bunch of random clips shot on the Pro to demonstrate its capabilities, I used the iPhone 12 Pro to shoot my entire iPhone 12 review video at 4k 60fps in Dolby Vision.Design and cameras aside, the 12 and 12 Pro sport the same A14 Bionic processor, same 5G modem and antennas, and comparable battery life at a little over 14 hours for both in our video rundown test. The 12 and 12 Pro both have smaller batteries than their predecessors, according to an iFixIt teardown, and are not the longest-lasting phones, to be sure. But both have Apple’s MagSafe magnetic charging technology built in. If you buy a MagSafe charger, which supports fast-charging up to 15W, you can power up from completely dead to 40% in 30 minutes using an 18W USB-C wall adapter. (The need to buy a separate $20 plug for the $40 MagSafe’s USB-C cable is real annoying, though.) As for 5G, well, if you’re connected to a lightning-fast millimeter-wave signal, then yes, the battery will drain quickly. But AT&T’s 5G network is composed primarily of low-band spectrum, so in my case, the iPhone 12 Pro lasted just as long as my iPhone 11 Pro before it died with heavy daily use, even with the smaller battery. (That may be due to the more efficient A14 Bionic.) I was able to pick up a 5G+ signal standing directly beneath a 5G node in a parking lot and saw a 5% battery drain in just a few minutes, but you won’t see that with typical use on 5G.Just like we saw with the iPhone 12, the 12 Pro’s A14 Bionic processor is a beast. Compared to Android flagships, well, there’s not much competition. Games may be smoother on devices with 120Hz refresh rates (compared to the 12 Pro’s 60Hz), but as I scrolled websites on a 12 Pro and Galaxy S20 side by side to compare the difference, I have to say... 120Hz is not so life-changing that it’s detrimental to Apple to have left it out. Would it be nice? Yes. Is it a phone-defining feature? No.The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are incredibly good phones. The 12 Pro’s cameras are better, and I prefer the look of the stainless steel with matte glass, so if you have the extra cash, it’s worth the upgrade. Will next year’s phones be better? Sure, they always are. But if you need a phone right now, I’d recommend the iPhone 12 Pro over just about everything else."
16,iPhone 12,https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-12-feels-like-a-1-000-phone-1845478737,"With four iPhone 12 options to choose from this fall,  ranging in price from $700 all the way to $1,100, it feels like Apple has muddied the waters a bit. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, because the company extended flagship features across the lineup. But it does make things a bit complicated. For the first time, Apple’s cheaper flagship iPhone doesn’t feel like a step down from the more expensive models, though there are a couple of trade-offs. Namely, you get two camera lenses in the iPhone 12 instead of the three you get with the 12 Pro, and you get an aluminum body instead of a stainless steel one—though the red, mint green, and deep blue iPhone 12 shades are almost more appealing than the 12 Pro lineup’s color range.Here’s the deal: Shit is rough out there. Many people’s jobs are hanging on by a thread, if at all. Owning a smartphone is non-negotiable, and if you need one that won’t feel outdated in a year, the $800 iPhone 12 is the one to get. The differences between the 12 and 12 Pro are so slight, and the 12 feels so premium, that saving a few hundred dollars and buying the base model iPhone this year doesn’t feel like a sacrifice. (This review is of the 6.1-inch iPhone 12—the 5.4-inch 12 Mini is due out next month and will be reviewed separately.)Apple spent its annual iPhone event hyping the new iPhone’s speed, courtesy of 5G and the new A14 Bionic processor. But it’s the 12's design and display that grabbed me right away. The first thing I noticed is how light it is, especially compared to the 12 Pro. That’s due to the aluminum Apple used instead of the Pro’s stainless steel, but it doesn’t feel cheap. Then there are the flat edges, which bring to mind the iPhone 4 and 5—the pinnacle of iPhone design—and feel much easier to grip than the iPhones of recent past. Particularly when running, I feel like I have a solid hold on the iPhone 12 due to its squared-off edges.Then there’s the 12's OLED display, which is stunning, especially compared to last year’s 6.1-inch iPhone 11, which was $700 but sported an LCD panel. Watching videos and playing games on this thing is a freakin’ dream; the blacks are rich and dark and colors look more vivid and dynamic compared to an LCD screen. The 12 also features Apple’s Ceramic Shield, the hardened glass front that promises to be four times more shatter-resistant than the iPhone 11 lineup. I haven’t yet dropped this phone (yet!), so I can’t personally attest to this, but I want to believe.Much ado has been made about Apple’s decision to stick with a 60Hz refresh rate for the iPhone 12's display instead of bumping up to 120Hz, as we’ve seen in competing flagships. If you’ve used other devices with a much higher refresh rate, you will notice the difference. Otherwise, you won’t. Like 5G, it seems like a thing Apple needed to add to future-proof its lineup for those who will hang on to this phone for three or four years. Unfortunately, Apple went all-in on 5G and not on high refresh rates. For most people, this isn’t a big deal, but it would’ve been a nice complement to the new design.Don’t get me wrong: The A14 Bionic is noteworthy. After you take in just how good the iPhone 12 looks, you might notice its performance. The new chip blew past all of this year’s Android flagships with the latest Snapdragon processors in our benchmarking tests. But last year’s A13 Bionic was also incredibly powerful. If you’re upgrading from an iPhone 8 or X, you’ll notice a huge jump in performance. If you’re coming from the 11? Not so much.But it’s 5G that Apple is emphasizing this year. I’ve written pretty extensively about the pitfalls and the potential of using 5G, a technology that has so far been the victim of its own hype. In my testing of various carriers’ networks across the U.S., I’ve never seen the 4 Gbps “ideal” download speeds Apple CEO Tim Cook referenced at the company’s iPhone event.At my house in Hollywood, download speeds are faster than what I usually see with AT&T’s 4G LTE network, which the carrier still to this day misleadingly calls 5G E, but not as speedy as the hype would have you believe. AT&T’s coverage map doesn’t distinguish between the slower low-band and the blazing fast, high-frequency millimeter-wave spectrum that comprises its 5G network, so while LA is blanketed with 5G, I can’t tell at a glance which kind. I reached out to AT&T to find out where exactly I could catch gigabit speeds with the iPhone 12. The company sent me two addresses within walking distance of my house.And that’s how I ended up in the parking lot of a Panda Express in the heart of Hollywood, arm outstretched with an iPhone 12 aimed in the direction of a 5G node. Here I finally saw gigabit speeds and AT&T’s 5G+ connectivity indicator, but still nowhere close to the 4 Gbps Cook referenced during the iPhone event. I ran several speed tests using Ookla’s SpeedTest app and consistently saw speeds in the 1.2-1.4 Gbps range. But stepping onto the sidewalk a few feet away from the Panda parking lot, speeds immediately dropped to 600 Mbps. Back at my house a few blocks away, speeds hovered around 130 Mbps.To take advantage of the fast speeds once I could finally tap into them, I stood in the parking lot and downloaded season six of Schitt’s Creek to watch offline on Netflix. It took one minute to download 14 episodes—not too shabby. I wracked my brain to think of what else I could accomplish with gigabit speeds while looking like an absolute weirdo with six phones on my person and came up with nothing. As I ventured away from the Panda Express with not even a carton of my favorite sugary kung pao chicken, I watched the 5G+ icon flip back to 5G, taking the fast speeds with it.But even if millimeter wave-based 5G could penetrate the walls of my house and deliver gigabit download speeds, it wouldn’t matter that much to me right now. I’ve been working from home with fiber internet for months. And the main reason I usually need ultra-fast connectivity while on the go is for work travel—a thing I’m not doing again for the foreseeable future. But envisioning a day when, just before boarding a flight, I can download movies, playlists, and books for offline entertainment in mere seconds (because I absolutely will never remember to do that at home days ahead of time) is truly thrilling.One irritating thing to note: Your current phone plan might not actually support 5G. I’ve had the same AT&T unlimited data plan for the last couple of years and just assumed that, given that it was the priciest of the carrier’s offerings, the plan would be 5G-compatible. Nope! I had to switch to an equivalent plan that cost exactly the same in order to activate 5G. If you buy an iPhone 12 and can’t seem to catch a 5G signal, check to make sure that you’re actually paying for a plan that includes it.Also of note: If you somehow find yourself always connected to a mmWave-based 5G network, pulling down gigabit speeds, your iPhone battery will probably die within hours. Fortunately, this will literally never happen. Remember the part where I had to hang out in a Panda Express parking lot to get an unfettered mmWave signal? Apart from that, I used the iPhone 12 heavily for several days without the best 5G has to offer, and even after  hours of speed tests, camera comparisons, music streaming, and the occasional (OK, often) mindless scroll through Instagram and Twitter, the 12 had plenty of life left. Apple also created a new 5G setting called Smart Data Mode, which will offload you to an LTE signal if you’re not doing anything that requires the faster speeds of 5G. This will save your battery, and it’s a good thing that it’s on by default. You can also choose for it to always be on either 5G or LTE by opening Settings, then tapping Cellular, Cellular Data Options, Voice & Data, then selecting which data setting you prefer.In our video rundown battery test, the iPhone 12 lasted more than 13 hours, which is a few hours shorter than rival flagships from Samsung and Google, but perfectly respectable.Like the other iPhones in this year’s lineup, the 12 has Apple’s MagSafe charging coil built into its back, which enables the phone to snap to Apple’s MagSafe charging puck (and other accessories). At first, I thought this was really cool: I like the little snap, so I never question if the phone is charging on its pad, and I appreciate being able to pick up the phone while it’s charging and continue to use it. But it also kind of seems like a solution in search of a problem.I’m not sure how many people even have wireless charging pucks for their iPhones—everyone I know still uses the Lightning cable and wall plug that used to come with a new iPhone in the box. (Now that that’s no longer the case, perhaps people will graduate to wireless charging.) The Lightning cable prevents you from plugging in anything while charging, but I would guess more people use Bluetooth earbuds or headphones than have any plans to buy a wireless charger.Apple’s MagSafe charger is also on the pricier side—$40—and while it comes with a USB-C cable, it doesn’t come with a wall plug. Do you know how many USB-C adapters I have? The one that came with my MacBook. Do you know how many USB-A plugs I have? Countless. I discover new ones every time I clean my house (which is weekly, tyvm). So to use a MagSafe charger and take advantage of its fast-charging capabilities (up to 15W), you’ll probably need to spend an extra $20 on a 20W USB-C power adapter. That’s $60. For a charger. On top of that, the puck and the iPhone get real warm when charging. If the phone gets too hot, it’ll stop charging at 80%.Look, I myself love a good charging solution. I’m currently testing a Mophie 3-in-1 charging dock for AirPods Pro, Apple Watch, and iPhone, and I absolutely love it. It’s $150, which is kind of bananas, but it’s the closest we’ve come to AirPower, which is what I actually want and know I can’t have. Maybe when the MagSafe Duo charger for watch and phone debuts, it’ll be a more convenient solution. (Perhaps a MagSafe Trio won’t be far behind?)I like it! But I could do without it.All of these features—redesign, Retina XDR display, 5G, A14 Bionic, MagSafe—extend across the iPhone 12 lineup. The biggest difference between the 12 and 12 Pro is, as expected, the camera array. The 12 sports a dual-lens set-up on the back with 12-megapixel wide- and ultra-wide cams, so it’s missing the telephoto lens you get with the Pro models. As you can see in the shots below, the 12 produces mostly solid shots, but the digital zoom is lacking, particularly in low-light scenarios.However, it does have Night Mode in both lenses—last year’s iPhone 11 had Night Mode in just the wide-angle cam—and the difference is notable. You have to play around with the background lighting to get a shot that isn’t grainy, the 12 holds its own with the 12 Pro, even in Portraits. Check out some comparison shots below.You’ll have to stay tuned for my iPhone 12 Pro review (coming later this week!) for a deep dive into the differences between the two phones’ cameras, but as a person who uses a telephoto lens far more often than the ultra-wide, I wish Apple had gone with a telephoto/wide-angle pairing for the 12's dual-lens array. The ultra-wide is great for dramatic shots, but the telephoto is more useful for daily life.I’ll be honest: When it comes to the iPhone 12 vs. 12 Pro, I prefer the Pro. Three camera lenses do make a difference. But you still get a whole lot of phone for $800 if you don’t want to splurge on the Pro model. If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone, the camera quality and performance will blow you away. More importantly, the iPhone 12 is a truly great iPhone that will continue to be good for years to come."
17,Pixel 5,https://gizmodo.com/google-is-bucking-trends-with-the-pixel-5-and-its-awes-1845386771,"Ever since Google bought a big chunk of HTC and began integrating its U.S. and Taiwan teams (the Pixel 3a was the first Pixel primarily designed in Taiwan), it’s felt like Google has been a bit confused about the Pixel’s direction. Two years ago we got a large Pixel with dual selfie cams and a fingerprint sensor in back, but then last year’s Pixel 4 featured one cam in front, two cams in back (including one with a zoom lens), and 3D facial recognition instead of a fingerprint reader.With the Pixel 5, we get a processor that’s a tier below what most flagships are rocking, an ultra-wide camera in back instead of zoom, and no XL version to complement the standard model with its relatively small 6-inch screen. And priced at just $700, the Pixel 5 also costs hundreds less than top-end phones from Samsung, Apple, and even OnePlus. Compared to the rest of the industry, Google is zagging where everyone else is zigging, subverting expectations, and bucking a bunch of  trends with almost reckless abandon. And you know what? It’s freaking working, because in a lot of ways, the Pixel 5 is the ultimate Google phone: It’s a good value and one of the most unique phones of the year.Compared to handsets from just a couple years ago, a phone with a 6-inch screen might not sound that small, but it is. The Pixel 5 is smaller than basically every phone released this last year aside, from the iPhone SE and the upcoming iPhone 12 Mini. In fact, despite having slightly more screen real estate thanks to its slimmer bezels, the Pixel 5 is actually smaller than the Pixel 3. In a post-OG Galaxy Note world where phones have been steadily growing ever larger for the better part of a decade, it takes some serious chutzpah to downsize.So even though I wish Google had made an XL version of the Pixel 5, the standard model’s dimensions are downright invigorating. As someone who deals with a lot of big-screen behemoths, it’s really nice to have a petite little phone that never feels heavy, bulky, or unwieldy. On the top edge of the Pixel 5, instead of going with a slim earpiece speaker like you get on practically every other phone, Google built a speaker into the Pixel 5's display, which vibrates the screen and produces noise when you make a call. The Pixel 5's vibrating screen also works with the phone’s bottom-firing speakers to produce a sort of pseudo-stereo audio. Overall quality is a bit lacking in bass, but booming lows are something that almost no phone can meaningfully pump out. Because it doesn’t need to use a traditional earpiece speaker, the Pixel 5 has a thin, unblemished bezel (well, aside from that hole-punch selfie cam), which wraps around the entire device and results in a  neat and sleek front facade.Google has even forgone the 3D face scanner it used on the Pixel 4, along with the fancy in-display fingerprint sensors so many premium phones have adopted, in favor of a good ‘ole digit reader in back. It’s fast, it’s simple, and in a time when stuff like Face ID and face unlock are basically useless when you’re wearing a mask, it’s nice to see that old-school biometric systems still have their merits.Strangely, perhaps the most interesting thing about the entire Pixel 5 is its back. Instead of glass or polycarbonate, the Pixel 5 technically has an aluminum body, though you’d never know it because Google has covered the Pixel 5's rear in “bio-resin.” It not only feels different than any other phone (and makes slapping a case on the phone somewhat unnecessary), it also makes the phone less slippery and allowed Google give the Pixel 5's signature Sorta Sage color more depth and richness than normal.But the back of the Pixel 5 is weird for two reasons. First, because of the bio-resin, which feels more like leather or paper than your average plastic. But the other reason is that most phone makers avoid using aluminum backs because metal panels generally don’t play nice with wireless charging, though that didn’t stop Google. So to make wireless charging work, Google made precise cuts in the Pixel 5's aluminum back to accommodate wireless charging coils, resulting in something that’s more durable than both traditional plastic and glass, with virtually none of the drawbacks. The Pixel 5 even supports reverse wireless charging (Google calls it Battery Share), so you can power up other devices that support Qi on the fly. How that’s for ingenuity?Furthermore, with the Pixel 5's extremely long battery life, using Battery Share is something that’s a joy to use. That’s because, despite its size, the Pixel 5's 4,000 mAh battery is actually the biggest battery Google has ever put in a Pixel. In our video rundown test, the Pixel 5 lasted 16 hours and 48 minutes. That’s the third longest time I’ve seen on a phone this year, behind the Moto Edge+ (17:18), and the Asus ROG Phone 3 (16:56). This is quite impressive because, historically, longevity has never been one of the Pixel line’s biggest strengths. But it definitely is now on the Pixel 5.Google’s counter-logical design thinking doesn’t stop when it comes to the phone’s exterior, either. Instead of using a Snapdragon 865 chip like a lot of other premium Android phones, the Pixel 5 features a chip from Qualcomm’s next rung down: the Snapdragon 765G. It’s a savvy move, because the Snapdragon 765G still offers support for all the major flavors of 5G and ample performance, while also lowering the Pixel 5's cost.With the Pixel 5's screen featuring a decent but not super high 2160 x 1080 resolution, much of the extra performance of a Snapdragon 865  probably would have been wasted. The Pixel 5 is more than snappy as is. Also, by cutting costs with its chip, it became easier for Google to incorporate other premium features like a rich OLED display, which also features a 90Hz refresh rate to help make games, websites, and animations look extra smooth. It’s not quite as good as 120Hz or 144Hz like you get some some more expensive phones, but it is noticeable and a worthy inclusion. Google even doubled up the Pixel 4's 64GB of base storage to 128GB on the Pixel 5, an upgrade I’m happy to take every time. But one of the most confounding decisions (at least for casual observers) that Google made with the Pixel 5 is to use the same Sony IMX363 sensor it used in the Pixel 4 and the Pixel 3 instead of picking out the latest and greatest camera sensor. In an industry where gadget makers are expected to push out yearly refreshes, sticking with the same camera sensor for three years in a row might seem bizarre, but once again, there’s a method to the madness. Instead of having to reinvent its image processing and camera algorithms every 12 months, Google has had a consistent platform that it’s been able to truly optimize, and the results speak for themselves.In bright light, the Pixel 5 produces pics with deep, saturated colors and more detail than you get on pretty much any other phone, regardless of price. And in darker environments, thanks to Night Sight (which now works on Portrait Mode shots), you get the best low-light camera quality around too. I also like that Google has leaned into its expertise with software to add three new video stabilization modes (locked, active, and cinematic pan), making the Pixel 5 a better tool to record special moments, both stills and video.That said, Google did ignore one major smartphone camera trend I really wish it hadn’t: only including two rear cams instead of three. I totally understand the reasoning behind going with an ultra-wide cam instead of a zoom cam on the Pixel 5, as it’s easier to give people more reach using software via Google’s Super Res Zoom than it is to increase a phone’s field of view. But if Google just included three rear cams—a wide angle, ultra-wide, and a telephoto—the Pixel 5 would stack up much better against its competition.Compared to the 5x optical zoom on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Super Res Zoom at 5x just can’t really hang. Now I admit that’s not a very fair comparison because the Note 20 Ultra costs almost twice the Pixel 5's price, but I’d still really love to see Google supplement Super Res Zoom with even just a 2x or 3x optical zoom to help capture sharper telephoto pics.Also, while Google’s strategy of sticking with the same image sensor for three years has worked up until now, I’m not sure how much longer that strategy can continue. Yes, the Pixel 5 manages to edge out the iPhone 11 and the latest Galaxy Note in most situations (especially low light), but that gap is closer than ever, and in bright light, Google definitely isn’t dunking on Apple and Samsung across the board. Other features like Portrait Mode with Night Sight don’t look as good as they should, and I can’t help but wonder if the Pixel 5's sensor is holding the phone back a bit in those situations. And let’s not forget, the iPhone 12 Pro Max with its advanced photography features is due out next month, which could shift that balance even more. However, not including a zoom cam is mostly a minor offense on a phone that only costs $700, and considering how many unwritten rules Google is straight up thrashing this time around, the Pixel 5 is kind of magnificent. It’s got great camera quality, more than sufficient performance, and a sneakily innovative design—not to mention all of the Pixel exclusive software features like Duplex, Call Screener, automatic captions, and, my personal favorite, the Pixel Recorder app. So while not offering a Pixel 5 model with a bigger screen means this phone might not be a great fit for everyone, for people who prefer a more compact device, the Pixel 5 is legitimately the best small Android phone around and a pretty good overall value. This year, Google said: Screw the playbook. The Pixel 5 is better for it."
18,Oneplus 8t,https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-8t-is-a-solid-phone-but-oneplus-needs-to-l-1845367964,"Over the last couple of years, OnePlus has sort of had the “budget flagship” phone segment to itself, offering well-built phones with top-notch specs for hundreds less than its traditional high-end competitors. However, with the price of premium phones having risen to $1,000 (or more), especially in 2020, many mainstream phone makers like Samsung and others have made a concerted effort to fill in the gap between their flagship devices and more affordable midrange fare.This puts OnePlus in a tricky position because, at $750, the new OnePlus 8T is facing stiffer competition than ever before. So even though the OP8T is no doubt a solid handset with a number of standout features, it’s not quite the slam dunk value we’re used to seeing from OnePlus.Like the OnePlus 8 that it’s replacing, the OP8T sports a glass-and-metal body available in two colors: aquamarine (seen here) and silver. You also still get OnePlus’ signature alert slider that lets you easily set the phone to vibrate or silent with the flick of finger, along with an optical fingerprint sensor built into its display. The only major bit of design that’s really changed is the OP8T’s rear camera module (we’ll get to that later), which sits off to the side and features a primary wide-angle cam, a new ultra-wide cam, a macro cam, and a monochrome sensor.The OP8T’s basic specs are pretty much the same too, with the phone powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage. And its 2400 x 1080 OLED screen looks just a rich and vibrant as before. However, on the flipside, the OP8T is also missing a lot of the same stuff the OP8 lacked, including a microSD card slot (which seems to have been permanently axed from all OnePlus phones along with headphone jacks) and wireless charging. So once again, we’re looking at a phone with strong performance but with a few common features stripped out compared to some of its rivals. OK, so what’s actually new on the OP8T?The first big upgrade is a new 120Hz 6.55-inch OLED display, which is up from 90Hz on the outgoing OP8. This puts the OP8T on the same playing field as the OP8 Pro and fancy Samsung Galaxy phones like the S20+ and Note 20 Ultra, while also being one of the biggest contributors to the OnePlus mission of making its phones feel smooth and fast. It really does make doing almost anything on the phone look better, and I expect that throughout the next couple years, 120Hz panels will become a standard feature on all phones above the $700 mark.As a handy new bonus, in conjunction with support for Android 11, OnePlus has also added an Always-On Display mode to the OP8T, which was one of the most commonly requested features from OnePlus users. And while AODs have become pretty common on phones nowadays (particularly phones with OLED displays), it’s nice being able to see stuff like the time and new notifications at a glance without unlocking your phone.Around back, the OP8T’s cameras have increased from three to four thanks to the addition of a 2-MP monochrome lens, which is supposed to help with color and depth info. It’s alongside a higher-res 5-MP macro cam, an even wider 123-degree ultra-wide cam, and a 48-MP main cam. Unfortunately, while having a more encompassing view for landscapes is nice, the OP8T’s overall image quality doesn’t seem to have improved that much. It’s not terrible by any means, and in bright light, the OP8T captures rich photos with relatively sharp details. But in the end, it’s still no match for something like the Pixel 5, with Google’s latest phone having a considerable edge in low light.Meanwhile, on the inside, OnePlus has given Oxygen OS (which is based on Android 11) a thoughtful revamp, once again cutting down unnecessary animations, and, more importantly, moving around a number of UI elements to make the phone easy to navigate with one hand. Oxygen OS’ new design takes a similar approach to Samsung’s OneUI by restricting most menus and tabs to the bottom two-thirds of the screen, so everything is easily within reach without having to adjust your grip or hunt for buttons in the top left or right corners. It’s a really nice upgrade to usability that doesn’t show up on a spec sheet, and with OnePlus still having one of the best native dark mode implementations on the market, there’s a lot to like about OnePlus’ take on Android.Finally, there’s the OP8T’s new 65-watt wired Warp Charge, which I believe is the fastest wired charging you can get on a phone officially on sale in North America. It’s like dumb fast. OnePlus claims Warp Charge can take the phone from 0 to 100% battery in 39 minutes, which is something that bore out in my testing, plus or minus a couple minutes. Now, for people who usually charge their phone overnight, this might not mean much in practice. But for others who only plug in when they absolutely have to, Warp Charge 65 lets you break the cycle and power up in short bursts at your convenience. And with battery life that lasted just shy of 14 hours on our video rundown test, the OP8T has enough juice to last all day and into the next morning, if that’s how you want to roll.OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 65 power brick also comes with a nice bonus, because even though the OP8T is the only device that can take advantage of all 65 watts of juice, OnePlus included the ability for the power brick to supply up to 45 watts of power to third-party devices. This means if you’re traveling (a quaint idea, I know), the OP8T’s brick works better as your one wired charging solution for pretty much any mobile device besides a large or medium-sized laptop.So all in all, the OP8T is a solid phone with a nice 120-Hz screen, great performance, good battery life, and extremely fast wired charging. But here comes the sad part, because at $750, all those high points just might not be enough. Compared to the OP8T, the new Galaxy S20 FE has the same processor, a similar 120-Hz display, equally strong battery life, support for  wireless charging, a microSD card slot, and 3x zoom camera instead of macro. And it costs $50 less. Oh, and the S20 FE has 5G support on all the big networks, unlike the OP8T, which only gets 5G on T-Mobile.Alternatively, while the $700 Pixel 5 is much smaller and has a slightly less powerful chipset, it has even better camera quality along with wireless charging, official IP-68 water resistance, and all those handy Pixel-specific software features. But the biggest argument against the OP8T might be the OP8 Pro, which has seen its price drop from $900 at launch to just $800. So for only $50 more than the OP8T, you get a 120-Hz display, a zoom camera (which I find is more useful than macro on an everyday basis), and wireless charging. The OP8T is a more than just a decent phone, but it’s stuck in between a bunch of even more enticing devices.In a way, all of the OP8T’s new competitors are validation for OnePlus’ original mission of providing high-end specs on phones with more affordable price tags. However, after having surpassed a number of older phones brands like HTC, and arguably both LG and Motorola in terms of importance, it also feels like OnePlus may be reaching a sort of inflection point. So while I still appreciate OnePlus’ devotion to smoothness and the OP8T itself, with OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei having left the company and OnePlus’ strategy of making budget flagships having become not quite as unique or convincing as it once was, it might be time for OnePlus to level up again."
19,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE,https://gizmodo.com/the-galaxy-s20-fe-is-the-more-affordable-samsung-phone-1845329837,"When Samsung chose the Galaxy S20 FE’s name (FE stands for Fan Edition), it did so because FE tested better in focus groups compared to other tags like “Lite” that normally get slapped on slightly cheaper budget flagship devices. But you know what? I’m kind of OK with that slice of corporate nonsense because it’s just two letters. And more importantly, for people who have been scared off by the $1,000+ price tags of Samsung’s other high-end phones, the S20 FE retains a lot of the premium features found in its more expensive siblings, all for just $700. That’s the same price as the 2016 Galaxy S7 at launch and $50 less than last year’s woefully underappreciated Galaxy S10e. So even though I’m not a huge fan of its name, I am a fan of the Galaxy S20 FE’s value.Compared to phones like the Galaxy S20 Ultra, the S20 FE is refreshingly simple. That said, you do get a wide range of color options including navy (seen here), lavender, mint, red, orange, and white. You also get a flat 6.5-inch OLED screen with 32-MP hole-punch selfie camera up front, triple cams in back, and a USB-C port down below—all in a body that’s about the same size as the Galaxy S20+. The S20 FE even comes with wireless charging with support for Wireless Powershare, so you can lend some extra juice to a friend in need or recharge a pair of Qi-compatible earbuds on the go. The only miss is that while some manufacturers are still equipping their more affordable handsets with a headphone jack, the S20 FE doesn’t have one, which means the next cheapest Samsung phone with an actual 3.5mm port is the Galaxy A71.Of course, to hit this price, Samsung has made a few concessions in terms of the S20 FE’s design and specs, but they’re ones I can live with. So instead of a QHD+ screen resolution, the S20 FE features an FHD+ 2400 x 1080 display. And while the S20 FE does support a 120HZ refresh rate that makes things look extra smooth, it’s not one of Samsung’s new VRR screens like you get on the Note 20 Ultra. Finally, in place of a glass rear panel, the S20 FE has what Samsung calls a “glasstic” back, which is a nice way of saying high-quality polycarbonate—plastic. It’s got a nice matte finish, but between being much less dense and conducting heat differently, there’s no mistaking it for real glass. There is an upside to this though, because compared to the Galaxy S20+, the S20 FE is noticeably lighter.Thankfully, Samsung didn’t make any compromises when it comes to the S20 FE’s processor, as it gets the same Snapdragon 865 chip used in its more expensive siblings—which means you don’t have to worry about getting hit with lag or stutter—along with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of base storage, and a microSD card slot. So despite its lower price, it’s nice having full flagship performance on the S20 FE. The S20 FE’s strong performance doesn’t stop there either, because it features a 4,500 mAh battery that’s just as big as what you get in the S20+ and Note 20 Ultra. The S20 FE’s battery life is fantastic. On our video rundown test, the S20 FE lasted just shy of 16 hours (15:52), which is way better than our 12-hour average and better than anything in this price range besides the OnePlus 8 (16:09).The one small wrinkle is that unlocked models of the S20 FE don’t have support for mmWave 5G (or AT&T’s special wifi calling protocol), just sub-6GHz 5G. So if you want a S20 FE that works properly on your network, you’ll have to buy one directly from your carrier, with Verizon’s special mmWave 5G-enabled S20 FE commanding a $50 premium over a standard model.The S20 FE sports a well-rounded trio of rear cameras, including a 12-MP main cam, a 12-MP ultra-wide cam, and an 8-MP telephoto cam with a 3x optical zoom. While the S20 FE’s cams exhibit a lot of the same characteristics seen on other Galaxy phones, like rich colors and solid exposure, it also has a lot of the same shortcomings, like a tendency to be a little over-aggressive when it comes to sharpening, and a low-light mode that’s pretty respectable, but not quite as good as Google’s Night Sight. The only con (and it’s a pretty minor one) I’ve found on the S20 FE is its in-screen optical fingerprint reader. It totally works and is generally pretty accurate, but I find it’s not quite as fast as what you get on a regular Galaxy S phone, and the light it needs to shoot out to read your digits can be a bit jarring at night.Look, the S20 FE isn’t quite as eye-catching as some of Samsung’s other more expensive phones, and I still kinda cringe at the notion that anyone would buy a second phone in less than a year simply because they are a fan. But if you long for the days when a good flagship phone cost around $700 instead of $1,000 or more, the S20 FE is a delight. It’s got a bright, colorful screen, a simple build with lots of color choices, great performance, and a solid assortment of cameras without anything even approaching a major flaw. The S20 FE has pretty much everything you really want without punishing your wallet, and that’s always a formula I can get behind."
20,Asus ROG Phone 3,https://gizmodo.com/you-might-not-like-it-but-the-rog-phone-3-is-what-peak-1845313015,"The ROG Phone 3 is big, it’s heavy, and it’s got more vents and RGB lighting than most people are probably comfortable seeing on a mobile device. But if you’re a gamer or you just want the absolute best performance you can get from an Android phone, like it or not, Asus’ unapologetically aggressive handset is your champion. From the moment you pick it up, the biggest difference between the ROG Phone 3 and more traditional smartphones is just how in your face it is—it’s like the Mountain Dew of phones. Its 6.59-inch 2340 x 1080 OLED screen is already quite large, and when you factor in a fair amount of bezel and dual front-facing speakers, the whole handset feels even bigger. In fact, weighing in at just under 8.5 ounces, the ROG Phone 3 is heavier than pretty much every phone on the market aside from funky folding or swiveling handsets like the Galaxy Z Fold 2 or LG Wing.But with that heft comes some pretty beastly components, including some of the loudest speakers I’ve tested on any phone in recent memory, and a screen that supports an industry-best 144Hz refresh rate. Now if we’re being honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the ROG Phone 3's 144Hz screen and the 120Hz displays Samsung has put on a number of its 2020 Galaxy phones (and there aren’t a ton of games that support 144Hz either), but for anyone coming from a phone stuck at 60Hz or even 90Hz, the difference is immediately noticeable. Everyday stuff like scrolling through websites looks much smoother, and in games, it helps eliminate some of the ghosting and blurry animations you see, especially during more intense combat.Meanwhile, along the top edge of the phone, Asus has included two touch sensors, which are actually split up into two Air Triggers on either side, providing a total of four customizable shoulder buttons for use while gaming. This is a feature I really appreciate, because I try to avoid lugging around add-ons like a separate controller or gamepad mount. As soon as you get those accessories, you begin compromising a phone’s portability. But with the ROG Phone, everything you need to game has already been built in, unless you really can’t do without things like physical joysticks (which I totally get).Despite all the brutishness, it’s clear Asus is still paying attention to gamers’ needs thanks to a design that augments the phone’s bottom USB-C port with two more on the side. These bonus ports are used for accessories like the included GameCool 3, which adds a passthrough USB-C port, a headphone jack, a kickstand, and even a fan to help the phone and your hands stay a little cooler. And by putting those USB-C ports on the side of the phone, it means you have access to those extra ports messing up your grip when holding the phone sideways. Pretty smart for a phone designed to play games where you cut down trees with a pickaxe. And in back, there’s Asus’s mean glowing eye logo, which I admit is a little much, but honestly, I kinda wish more phones have support for external RGB lights.But clearly the best thing about the ROG Phone 3 is its performance. In both traditional performance benchmarks like Web XPRT 2015 and Geekbench 5 and more gaming-focused tests like 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme, Asus’ phone churned out aces across the board, and often finished 5 to 10% ahead of similarly-priced flagship phones sporting the same Snapdragon 865 chip. On top of that, Asus also includes a whopping 512GB of base storage, which is more than enough to make me forget that the ROG Phone 3 doesn’t have a microSD card slot.The end result is a phone that always, and I do mean always, feels snappy, even before you squeeze the phone’s sides and enable Asus’ X-Mode, which frees up RAM and boosts processor performance to help ensure you aren’t hit with any lag. X-Mode also works with Asus’s Armoury Crate, which allows you to create custom profiles for specific games, so you can have different settings depending on the title. Honestly, it’s more customization than anyone really needs, but for those times when you want the ability to tweak things just how you like it, it’s a nice combo you don’t really get on other phones.And for a gaming phone, even the ROG Phone 3's cameras are pretty good—not quite as proficient as a Pixel 4 mind you, but respectable nonetheless. In well-lit daytime shots, the ROG Phone 3 produced sharp photos with bright colors that only missed slightly on finer details and color saturation. And in a nighttime shot of a spooky skeleton, the ROG Phone 3's auto low-light mode captured a surprisingly well-exposed shot that is actually a bit too bright. That said, in very dark situations, Google’s Night Sight still has a major advantage in low-light environments.Finally, with its massive 6,000 mAh battery, the ROG Phone 3's time of 16 hours and 56 minutes is the second best time ever on our video rundown test, only falling short of the original Galaxy Z Fold’s mark of 17:18.Look, I don’t blame anyone who wants to write the ROG Phone 3 off as a stunt device meant to attract gamers by dangling RGB lighting and see-through venting in their faces, because that’s definitely part of its schtick. But the ROG Phone 3 also backs up its aesthetic with the best performance I’ve seen on an Android phone this year, and with handy features like Asus’ AirTriggers and its side-mounted USB ports, the ROG Phone 3 also sports a thoughtful design that really does help people enjoy mobile gaming better. The ROG Phone 3 definitely ain’t for everyone, and even though some folks might just be buying one to flex on their friends, there’s no doubt this phone’s got game."
21,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2,https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-2-is-proof-that-you-should-skip-1845108484,"The original Galaxy Fold was the most important phone of 2019. It showed how flexible display tech could create a totally new type of device with the portability of a phone and the big screen and improved multitasking experience of a tablet. However, like a lot of first-gen products—especially something that ambitious—you really had to question if it was worth putting up with all of the Fold’s issues (of which there were many) to just experience something truly cutting edge.But now the Galaxy Z Fold2 is here with improvements that address nearly all of its predecessor’s faults, while also adding new features that make it an even better and more forward-thinking hybrid. And while its $2,000 price tag still makes me want to cry, the Galaxy Z Fold2 is a massive second-gen success.One of the most obvious upgrades on the Z Fold2 is its design. By sharpening up the sides of the phone while smoothing out its finish, the Z Fold2 feels significantly more solid and well-built. Samsung also redesigned the Z Fold2's hinge, so that the screens stay put regardless of how far they’re open, and by adding more brushes to the inside of the hinge and closing up the gaps on last year’s model, the Z Fold2 is much better equipped to deal with dirt. Samsung even borrowed the matte glass back from the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra for use on the Z Fold2, which makes the phone more appealing both visually and texturally. That said, it’s important to remember that the Z Fold2 still doesn’t have an official rating for dust or water resistance. We’re talking upgrades here, not magic.Samsung has also streamlined the Z Fold2's design by axing the original Fold’s large interior camera notch and replacing it with a simple punch-hole selfie cam. In fact, by moving from two interior selfie cams to just one, the Z Fold2 actually has one less camera overall compared to the first Fold, and I think the Z Fold2 is better for it.However, weighing in at 9.95 ounces, it’s actually a touch heavier than the original Fold and when compared to something like the Surface Duo, you can really see why Microsoft was so committed to making its take on a foldable phone exceedingly thin and light. So while the Z Fold2's heft isn’t a deal breaker, it’s something I’ll be looking for Samsung to reduce on future models.But by far, the Z Fold2's most important design win is its significantly larger 6.2-inch Cover Screen, which fully utilizes the phone’s front facade. So now with that extra space, you can finally use the Z Fold2's Cover Display to quickly check emails, view maps, or respond to texts. Sure, compared to most phones, typing on a screen this narrow still feels slightly cramped, but compared to how things were before, it’s practically a non-issue. This means you can finally use the Z Fold2's outside screen for short tasks, while leaving the phone’s flexible display for when you want that full big screen splendor.And what a magnificent experience it is, because in addition to increasing its total screen size from 7.3 to 7.6-inches, Samsung also added support for a 120Hz variable refresh rate. This allows the phone to adjust its refresh rate depending on the kind of content you’re watching, helping you save battery life when you’re looking at static photos, and pumping it up when you’re playing games. Samsung has even improved the Z Fold’s multitasking making it easier to use two apps at once, or even three if that’s what you need. And when combined with a peak brightness of over 650 nits, even the faint crease that runs down the middle of the screen, the Z Fold2's screen looks better than a lot of boring old glass-front displays.Now I realize that drooling about a 7.6-inch screen on a phone is like one step away from officially embracing grandpa status doing stuff like taking everyday photos with a tablet. But for so many different activities, bigger screens are just better. I can more enjoyably watch a movie in bed, or play games without squinting at tiny crosshairs. And because the Z Fold2 features an OLED screen, it downright awesome for reading e-books with a white text on a pure black background. It’s the dark mode dream. There’s one thing that drives me kind of crazy though: the Z Fold2's pre-installed “screen protector.” After the debacle that was the original Galaxy Fold’s launch, I thought there was no way that Samsung would allow  anything close to that happening again. But for some reason, the Z Fold2 comes with a screen protector that according to the warnings that come with the phone should “not be removed” because doing so “may cause product damage.” What the hell, is it a screen protector or part of the screen itself?Don’t get me wrong, I understand the need for an abundance of caution when it comes to a phone this expensive, but the problem is that because the screen protector feels worse than the naked flexible display on my Galaxy Z Flip, attract slightly more fingerprints, and has edges that over time might come loose, I imagine that at some point Galaxy Z Fold2 owners will be forced to remove the screen protector or send the phone out for service.  And if anything does happen to that screen protector, Samsung wants users to take their phone into service center, because us morons can’t be trusted to do it ourselves. Sigh.Elsewhere, the Z Fold2 has expectedly powerful specs including a Snapdragon 865+ processor (which includes support for 5G), 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, side-mounted fingerprint sensor, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging. Even its speakers sound louder and clearer, which means the only things you might be still be longing for are a headphone jack and a microSD card slot. The Z Fold2's battery has also gotten bigger at 4,500 mAh, which is good because between that 120Hz display and 5G, it needs all the juice it can get. On our video rundown test, the Z Fold2 with 120Hz mode turned on lasted just over 10 hours,  with 120Hz disabled, it fared much better with a time of 15:03. That’s still short of the 17+ hours I got from the original Fold, and I suspect  that enabling 120Hz causes YouTube to suck up more juice than it really should because in normal use, its battery life is prodigious. Often, even after a full day’s use, I would still have 40% or more battery before plugging in back in around midnight.Finally, with its triple rear cameras which include a 12-MP main cam, a 12-MP ultra-wide cam, and a 12-MP 2x telephoto cam, the Z Fold2 is a strong, well-rounded shooter. Now it’s true that compared to a Pixel 4, the Z Fold2 still loses when it comes to pure image quality (though it’s close). But considering that even the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra doesn’t consistently outperform Google’s best, that shouldn’t really be a surprise.For all the people who are wary of first-gen products (and rightfully so), the Z Fold2 is a shining example of why it makes sense to wait. It’s faster, it’s got a hugely refined design, and thanks to its improved and enhanced flexible display, the Z Fold2 is an even better replacement for a multitude of gadgets in your life. It’s a phone, it’s a tablet, it’s an e-reader, and with its gorgeous, perfectly-sized display, it’s an almost ideal comic viewing device too. That’s three, maybe four devices in one. It’s a futuristic visage of tech convergence that’s available today. And thanks to a stronger, more stable hinge, the Z Fold2 is also a part-time cameraman too, allowing you to record video of yourself simply by setting the phone down, tilting its rear camera up, and hitting record.The only thing Samsung didn’t really fix is the Z Fold2's price. $2,000 isn’t just expensive, it’s almost downright absurd, and I can’t fault anyone for turning a cheek or immediately banishing it from their mind due to its cost. For a lot of people, the typical single-screen slab is perfectly adequate. But for anyone who has dreamed about tech that allows phones to do more, the Z Fold2 is a pioneer of the post-phone era. The Z Fold2 offers an experience unlike anything else on the market, so while that price might not make any logical sense, somehow it’s still not completely outlandish. "
22,Microsoft Surface Duo,https://gizmodo.com/microsofts-surface-duo-is-a-revolution-in-the-making-1845007674,"Between its price, specs, and most notably its design, Microsoft’s Surface Duo is one of the most divisive phones in recent memory. But after getting the chance to use one, I can’t help but find the amount of vitriol, incredulity, and straight-up hate that gets lobbed the Surface Duo’s way incredibly perplexing.I mean, just think about it for a minute. While they’re not for everyone, when it comes to having two displays connected to a laptop, the advantages are obvious. You get more real estate for various apps, the ability to quickly drag files from one place to another, and powerful multitasking. But for some reason, as soon as you mention the idea of a dual-screen phone, that device becomes a demon, something to be shunned or mocked. This kind of sentiment feels wildly at odds during a time when people’s primary computer is a phone, not a laptop.That’s precisely where the Surface Duo comes in, because even when compared to previous dual-screen phones like the ZTE Axon M, LG G8X, and others, the Surface Duo feels like the first phone built and designed from the start to support dual displays. However, as the Surface Duo tries to make way for a new category of smartphone, there’s a definite learning curve for Microsoft as both a software developer and a first-time Android handset maker, and also for the user as they try to take advantage of the Surface Duo’s capabilities. It’s not easy, and at some points the $1,400 Surface Duo feels very experimental. But that’s kind of to be expected when a device is trying to start a revolution.For the Surface Duo, so much of the phone’s success is reliant on its design, which only becomes more impressive when you realize how much thought and consideration went into every aspect. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 (which is 16.8 mm thick when closed), the Surface Duo has an almost nonexistent gap between its two halves when folded shut. With each screen measuring just 4.8 mm thick (or 9.9 mm when closed), the Surface Duo seems impossibly thin, which is just what Microsoft wanted.Meanwhile, the exterior of the device is practically unblemished, aside from the Microsoft logo embedded within the Duo’s outside glass, a USB-C port along the bottom, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and the usual buttons for power and volume.But what you can’t see on the inside is just as critical, because unlike regular phones, the Surface Duo has duplicate sensors and accelerometers in both halves of the device, allowing the Duo to recognize which “posture” it’s in, so the phone can react properly to any of its various modes, whether it’s closed, propped up like a tent, sitting on a table like a mini-laptop, or rotated a full 360 degrees so that only one screen is in use.Furthermore, the Surface Duo feels balanced, almost like a proper chef’s knife, with Microsoft intentionally putting the Duo’s center of gravity toward the bottom of the hinge when it’s fully open. This means that simply by putting your thumb on the lower hinge at the base of the phone, the Duo rests gently in your hand just like a real book. It feels like the most natural thing in the world. And then there’s the hinge, which not only features a constant resistance which gives you confidence it can support itself in any position, but also allows for power and data to be transferred from one side of the phone to the other, without any threat of breaking or twisted cables.Thought’s even been put into the Duo’s dual 4:3 5.6-inch AMOLED displays. While they feel quite wide and somewhat cumbersome compared to the 18:9 or 21:9 screens on so many new phones, that extra width really comes in handy when it comes to general multitasking.However, all that thinness and sleekness does come with trade-offs. To keep the Surface Duo that slim, Microsoft had to axe support for NFC, wireless charging, expandable storage, and water resistance—all things you’d normally get on a phone in this price range. And with only a single camera positioned on the inside of the Duo, taking a photo is an unusually complicated process—but more on that in a bit.Despite the Duo being both tall and wide, its thinness transforms it into an incredibly futuristic, exquisitely crafted device. Microsoft made a point of going this thin for a reason, and it’s something that enhances the experience every time you use it. I just hope that going forward, Microsoft can retain these sleek dimensions (maybe with a small bump up in thickness) while adding back more standard features.Billed as the “Microsoft you love with the Android you know” by chief product officer Panos Panay, the Surface Duo’s software hits that mark right on the head. You get many of the familiar Android gestures mixed with the flat, unapologetically boxy UI used in Windows 10. However, to enhance the Duo, Microsoft has also tweaked some things to help evolve Android’s gesture language to better support dual-screen multitasking.In this way, Microsoft is sort of entering uncharted territory, which means both us and Microsoft (and its partnership with Google) are learning as we go. You can still do things like swipe up from the bottom to go home, but when it comes to swiping in from the sides to go back, that only works on one side. When in dual-screen mode, swiping in from the middle of the phone starting at the hinge is not only awkward, it’s hard to do. This means you have to learn where you can and can’t swipe depending how you’re using the Duo, and with so many modes, it can take some getting used to.Then there are completely new gestures like grabbing the small tab at the bottom of an app and dragging it to the hinge, which allows an app on one side of the phone to suddenly span both displays. Not only does this change the way an app looks and functions, it also gives app developers a new way of designing how an app works, with Microsoft giving apps like Outlook and Powerpoint an enhanced UI to better utilize the Duo’s dual screen nature. This really transforms the way you use apps that actually have this added level of support. The problem is that with the idea of dual-screen phones still so new, it’s going to take a while for app makers who aren’t Microsoft to adjust. Aside from a handful of apps like the Kindle app and photo editing app Mylio, only Microsoft’s first-party Android apps really have this type of functionality currently.There are other new things, like being able to simply flick apps from one side of the screen to another with the flick of your thumb. It’s so easy and intuitive, and compared to the dedicated pop-up menus for screen controls used on other dual-screen phones from LG and others, it’s much more elegant too. However, with the Duo being the first phone to really need these new gestures and controls, things don’t always work every time, or work as you would expect, which is where the aspect of the Duo’s learning curve comes in. It’s steeper than what you encounter on any other phone. Yet when you get it right, it’s really rewarding.To call the Surface Duo’s ability to multitask a strength would be an understatement, as it’s basically a completely new experience. That’s because what people consider multitasking on phones today isn’t really multitasking at all. Sure, you might have apps running in the background, but you’re never really doing two things at once. Everything is a series of actions. Say you’re reading a story and you see a juicy quote or a funny meme that you want to share.You highlight the text, copy it, swipe up to go home, tap on your messaging app of choice, paste it in, and hit send. That’s not multitasking, its a series of steps! Or maybe you use an app’s built-in share menu, which opens up a tray at the bottom of the phone while the rest of the screen goes dark and sits there unused. The closest  you can get to real multitasking on most single-screen phones is stuff like YouTube’s picture-in-picture feature, which lets you watch videos in a miniscule window while you do other stuff. But on the Surface Duo, you can have separate apps open at the same time, or launch two apps with a single press using Microsoft’s App Groups feature. And if you’re using one of Microsoft’s 365 apps or Edge, you can even drag and drop text, which feels like a dream come true. You can have Slack open on one screen while you scroll through emails on another, or pull ingredients from a recipe seamlessly into your weekly grocery list. The Surface Duo even has a sort of physicality to its multifunctionality, because, with its ability to transform into a mini laptop, it can prop itself up while you’re cooking, or turn into a mini-arcade. And if you simply want to live-tweet while you’re streaming a show on the other screen, the Surface Duo can do that too, better than anything else on the market. It’s multitasking unlike any  that’s come before Microsoft even gave the Duo the smarts to know that if you have one app open on the left and nothing on the right (or vice versa) clicking a link will automatically open a new app on the inactive display, so as to maximize all that screen. This opens up the potential for the Surface Duo to be a real creation device. I can be in the process of writing a story on one screen (on a phone, which I would normally never even try to do), while I use the other to pull in resources or links without ever having to close or dismiss my current working doc. Multitasking is the real power of the Surface Duo—even if you aren’t using both screens at once all the time at 100%. That’s OK. But for those times when you do need to use two apps side-by-side, just like having dual monitors at your desk, the increased productivity is undeniable.Strangely, one thing Microsoft didn’t include is the ability to mirror one display to the other, which would be nice for possibly sharing a video with someone else, or showing them what they look like in real time while posing for a photo. That said, this is one thing that many users have already asked for, and Microsoft is hoping to add in a future update.One of the quirks about the Surface Duo is while the phone costs significantly more than an expensive premium phone in 2020, its guts are a little underwhelming. With a Snapdragon 855 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of storage (or 256 GB if you pay for the upgrade), the Surface Duo’s specs are closer to what you’d get on a high-end phone in 2019. In fact, aside from having slightly less base storage (just 64 GB), those are exactly the same specs you got on a Google Pixel 4 That’s not to say the Surface Duo is hitting the streets with completely outdated specs, but there is a performance gap of around 15% to 25% in tests like WebXPRT 2015, Geekbench 5, and others between the Surface Duo and current 2020 flagship phones. And when you add in the small overhead required to power two screens instead of phones, you get a phone that usually feels snappy, but often isn’t as smooth or stutter-free as you might like.Now, some of this is sure to be addressed by patches and software optimizations that Microsoft will deliver down the line, as even prior to its official release, Microsoft pushed out an update that significantly improved stability and responsiveness. But there are bugs, quite a few in fact, and they aren’t hard to find.Even if you account for user error stemming from having to learn and internalize Microsoft’s new language for manipulating dual screen apps, there are still a lot of situations where the Surface Duo’s screen rotates seemingly at random (or doesn’t rotate at all), doesn’t respond to swipes, or causes apps to hang or crash. Sometimes, the Surface Duo’s wallpaper would simply disappear until the next time I restarted the phone, and while playing Gunbound, I even ran into a weird bug that caused my homescreen to merge with the game’s background, which caused shadowy app icons to show up inside the game.But perhaps the most frustrating bug I encountered was in the Kindle app, where the app’s special dual-screen UI that simulates a real book would work, then not work, then work again seemingly without any rhyme or reason. To me, most of these bugs were minor annoyances. I wish they weren’t there, but I’m willing to live with them to try out a phone with some aggressive aspirations. But at the same time, I can’t fault anyone who doesn’t want to encounter them at all, especially during those times when all you want to do is grab the Duo and unwind by reading a book.Look, there’s no getting around it, Surface Duo’s camera experience is simply the weakest part of the device. Now I will admit that by putting the Duo’s camera just above its right-side display, it’s relatively easy to use when taking selfies or making video calls. But for everything else, the Duo’s lone camera is often awkward to use and captures potentially disappointing photos—especially in low light.To start, before you even get to tap that shutter button you’ll need to open the phone all the way, open the Camera app so it’s in selfie mode, AND THEN rotate the Duo like you’re doing a backslide flip on a skateboard, so that the camera, which normally points toward you, now faces away. And during that last part, you have to hope that the Duo’s internal accelerometers recognize the motion, because there isn’t a dedicated button for telling the Camera app to switch from one side of the phone to the other.All told, it’s a pretty lengthy and cumbersome process, and while you do start to learn how to rotate the Duo to get it to do what you want, the Duo still misses from time to time. And if you’re someone who likes to snap quick pictures of a pet or child, this setup means you’re simply going to miss some shots that you would have been able to capture on another phone.But what’s even more concerning is the quality of the photos the Duo produces. Like most phones nowadays, in well-lit conditions, the Surface Duo is an adequate shooter, though it lacks the kind of sharpness and saturated colors you’d normally get from a premium phone. Without a dedicated zoom lens, trying to push in with the Duo’s 11-MP camera results in rather flat looking photos that become pixelated quite quickly. However, when the lights go down, the Surface Duo’s image quality degrades fast, resulting in soft, dark, and grainy photos. In a nighttime shot looking out at NYC, even without Night Sight enabled on a Pixel 4 XL, the Surface Duo struggled to gather enough light and produced a noisy image with little in the way of sharpness comparatively. With the Night Sight turned on, it really feels like the Surface Duo’s camera is years behind Google’s 2019 flagship. Results like this occurred regularly in low light, with Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 soundly trouncing the Surface Duo in a shootout of a skate park and a neighborhood book drop at night. The photos aren’t even close, and when you look at the Z Fold 2's photos and see the multiple light sources nearby, it’s kind of distressing.In fact, the Surface Duo’s low light photos are so bad, instead of comparing it to other premium phones, I ran another nighttime test, pitting the Duo against a $250 budget handset in the Moto G Power. The Duo lost that battle, too. In a head-to-head face-off capturing images of graffiti, a nearby path, and a random flower, the Duo couldn’t keep pace with the G Power, turning in pics that were generally darker, grainier, and less detailed than the Moto. The Surface Duo’s best performance was in the shot of the flower, where at best, it produced a photo that was slightly sharper, but had a worse exposure.As someone who back in April said it was too early to nitpick the Surface Duo’s cameras, now that I’ve had a chance to check out examples from an actual retail device instead of early pre-product teases, it’s official: The Duo’s camera just isn’t good. This is something Microsoft needs to address in future models if the Duo line has any dreams of seeing mainstream success. And while I love the sleekness that you get from not having any cameras on the exterior of the Duo, I just don’t think that’s a feasible tactic.For such a thin device with two screens to power and manage, the Surface Duo has surprisingly strong battery life. With just one screen active, the Surface Duo lasted 12 hours and 31 minutes on our video rundown test, just five minutes shy of the Pixel 4 XL’s mark of 12:36. And with both screens in use, while Duo took a small hit to longevity, for what effectively amounts to a 8.1-inch display, a time of 11 hours flat ain’t bad.The Surface Duo is an incredibly difficult device to review. On the one hand, it’s a dual-screen Android phone that people can simply go out and buy. But on the other, the Surface Duo is a gadget that’s trying to lead by example, showing other device-makers and users alike what’s possible on this new class of phone.That said, that $1,400 price tag almost immediately rules out most people, particularly anyone who still doubts the power and potential of having two screens on a phone or can’t deal with bugs. This Surface Duo is for people who have dreamed of having real multitasking on a phone, and are willing to put up with growing pains to experience that for themselves. There’s little excuse for a phone this expensive to have image quality this bad, which is why it’s so important for anyone considering the Duo to know what they’re getting into.At the same time, even with its flaws, the Surface Duo is already an incredibly powerful business phone. It’s almost perfectly designed to allow employees to do things like check emails while simultaneously viewing their calendar to make sure they aren’t about to miss a meeting. This goes double for any company that’s already invested in Microsoft’s 365 suite, whose mobile apps have been optimized for the Duo.But the biggest impact of the Surface Duo is serving as an example of why having two screens on a phone can be just as powerful as having two screens on a PC. Honestly, it’s kind of surprising it’s taken this long for something like the Surface Duo to appear. This is Microsoft trying to replicate what it did when it created a new category of devices with the original Surface. It’s not perfect, but the revolution is here."
23,Galaxy Note 20 Ultra,https://gizmodo.com/the-samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-is-a-super-phone-final-1844760597,"When Samsung released the Galaxy S20 Ultra at $1,400, it felt like Samsung was trying to push its super-premium phones into a whole new tier, a tier that would justify its obscene $1,400 price tag. However, even though the S20 Ultra had a giant 6.9-inch screen and a huge 10x lossless zoom, it lacked some of Samsung’s usual polish and simply didn’t offer enough to make me feel like all that money was worth it.But fast forward six months, and now the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has arrived sporting an even better screen with a variable 120Hz refresh rate, a much more refined design, speedier performance, enhanced productivity, and an upgraded S-Pen. Oh, and it’s actually slightly cheaper than the S20 Ultra. So after some careful retooling, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has become a fully armed and operational battle station, and it’s the true heir to the empire.Unlike the S20 Ultra which always felt sorta clunky, between its signature Mystic Bronze finish and new matte glass back, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra feels like the first-class device that Samsung has been trying to deliver. In fact, aside from its admittedly large camera bump, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s body and bezels are actually slightly thinner than the Galaxy S20 Ultra’s, so even though both phones have 6.9-inch screens, the Note 20 Ultra feels like the much more wieldy device. As for that camera bump, while it does stick out quite a bit, considering the number of buyers who instantly throw their phones into cases the moment they get it, it’s hard to complain about too much. Big camera modules are here, and they aren’t going away anytime soon. The Note 20 Ultra’s biggest upgrade is its new 120Hz variable refresh rate display. Every year, Samsung saves its best mobile screen for the Note, and this year Samsung is really flexing on its competition because there’s no other display like this on the market. During testing, the Note 20 Ultra’s display hit a peak brightness just short of 800 nits (with Samsung claiming the Note 20 Ultra is capable of up to 1000 nits in certain conditions), while also producing some of the most vivid, eye-catching colors around.And on top of all that, Samsung has upgraded the Note 20 Ultra’s 120Hz display to support variable refresh rates, so that instead of being locked to 60Hz or 120Hz as on the S20 Ultra, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s display can adjust its refresh rate dynamically depending on what’s on the screen. This lets the Note 20 Ultra conserve power when you’re doing less intensive things like viewing photos or typing an email, which is important because as a phone that supports full 5G connectivity, when you do connect to a next-gen cell network, having extra juice in the tank is always welcome. And when you’re watching movies or playing games, you can take full advantage of those high refresh rates to get super smooth looking video and graphics.On the inside, the Note 20 Ultra is also overflowing with an excess of specs and performance. Boasting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865+ processor, 12GB of RAM, 128GB of base storage (or 512GB if you upgrade), and a microSD card slot, Samsung’s hyper phone never feels like you’re taxing it, no matter how hard you try. Across the board, the Note 20 Ultra consistently posted top-tier benchmark numbers, including the highest score we’ve ever seen on Geekbench 5's Compute test (3,658). I also really appreciate that Samsung gave it the ability to connect to any Miracast-enabled TV while using DeX, which gives you yet another way to utilize all of the phone’s performance. For a phone that’s designed to cater toward power users, combined with Samsung’s usual wired DeX mode, this really elevates the Note 20 Ultra from being a really powerful phone into more of a laptop replacement, or at least something you can get real work done on in a pinch. Speaking of work, in addition to the Note 20 Ultra’s new screen having variable refresh rate (VRR), Samsung has also lowered its touch input latency down to just 9 milliseconds, just like what you get on the Tab S7+ or an iPad Pro. This makes note taking, sketching, or whatever else you use the S-Pen for feel incredibly smooth. And with five new Anywhere Actions for going Back, going Home, summon Recent Apps, using Smart Select, and turning on Screen Write, you could easily use a Note 20 Ultra to host a full Powerpoint presentation without ever needing to hook up a real computer. But that’s not all, because thanks to the ability to more easily annotate directly onto PDFs using the S-Pen, automatically sync the Samsung notes apps across multiple devices, and link the Note 20 Ultra to a Windows PC via the Your Phone app, using the Note 20 as a complementary work device is even easier now too.Meanwhile, around back, Samsung has remixed the camera components from the S20 Ultra for the Note 20 Ultra, so that this time you get a 108-MP main cam, a 12-MP ultra-wide cam, and a 12-MP telephoto with a 5x optical zoom. And instead of a 3D time-of-flight sensor, Samsung gave the Note 20 Ultra a new laser autofocus system. This might be one of the most clever adjustments Samsung made for the Note 20 Ultra, because by including one less camera ( especially one that was somewhat gimmicky), Samsung was able to lower the price of the phone’s components, while also giving you better more usable camera performance in the real world.Now admittedly, the Note 20 Ultra’s cameras aren’t without their flaws, because like a lot of Samsung phones, they have a tendency to go a little too hard on sharpening and can sometimes push white balance to skew too yellow, but overall, the Note 20 Ultra’s image quality is just a bit behind what you get from a Pixel 4, which is a respectable place to be. Details are generally sharp, shutter lag is almost non-existent (unless you turn on the phone’s full 108-MP resolution mode), and it’s Pro Video recording mode has even more features and settings for more advanced mobile videographers. And if you have a pair of Galaxy Buds Live, you can even use them as a remote mic while filming when paired with the Note 20 Ultra. Finally, while the Note 20 Ultra’s 4,500 mAh isn’t quite as large as what you get in a Galaxy S20 Ultra (5,000 mAh), thanks to its more energy-efficient processor and screen, it’s overall battery life of 14 hours and 23 minutes was just 20 shorter than the S20 Ultra (14:41). That’s better than an iPhone 11 Pro (13:00), and a Pixel 4 XL (12:36), but just a bit shorter than an iPhone 11 Pro Max (15:00)For a long time, I’ve been asking what the Galaxy Note line is supposed to be other than just a Galaxy S with a built-in stylus, and with the Note 20 Ultra, Samsung has finally responded. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a gorgeous screen with faster performance and even more productivity features than you get in the fanciest Galaxy S phone, along with way more productivity features and a price tag that’s $100 less. Frankly, the S-Pen is just a bonus, and when it comes to taking notes during meetings or just drawing silly captions on photos, I’m glad it’s still around. But even without it, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is still so much more thoughtful and refined than the S20 Ultra, or any other super premium phone. Yes, even at $1,300, this thing is still exceedingly expensive, but at long last, Samsung has finally made something truly worth of that “Ultra” tag."
24,Pixel 4a,https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-4a-review-the-best-budget-phone-of-2020-1844575872,"As smartphones continue to get more sophisticated and more expensive, there’s a question that becomes increasingly relevant: How much phone do you actually need? Features like a built-in stylus, a foldable screen, and wireless charging are certainly nice to have, especially when they’re built into the same device you use to text, shop, watch videos, or pay your bills. Those features are also luxuries. But on the Pixel 4a, it feels like Google is trying to make a statement about what should be considered essential smartphone tech. You get a single flat screen, a camera in the front, a camera in the back, a fingerprint reader, and a headphone jack for $350. If the Pixel 4a is supposed to be the essence of smartphone simplicity, I think Google nailed it.Now of course the pursuit of simplicity comes with an obvious trade-off: a lack of options. So unlike Google’s other phones, there’s no XL version of the Pixel 4a. There’s only one model, which features a 5.8-inch 2340 x 1080 OLED display. There aren’t any color options either, just matte black plastic, that’s it. I think the lack of other colors is sad considering hues used on Google’s other gadgets (like Purplish on the Pixel 3a) are some of the most interesting shades on the market, but for the majority of people who throw their phone in a case immediately after getting it, it’s not that big of a deal. Aside from a shadowy gray G on the back of the phone, the only thing that breaks up all the matte black plastic is the phone’s minty power button.But forget color, by going with a smaller display, Google has made a device that’s wonderfully compact, while relatively thin bezels and a punch-hole selfie cam help preserve as much screen real estate as possible. Look, there’s nothing wrong with a big ‘ole phablet, but after using the Pixel 4a for more than a week, its dimensions feel downright refreshing. Meanwhile, instead of trying to hide the phone’s fingerprint reader beneath its screen, Google opted for a rear fingerprint sensor smack dab in the middle of the phone’s back,  located right where your fingers naturally rest when you pick up the phone. It’s a fast and straightforward solution that just works, no high-tech trickery needed.I also really appreciate that Google included an OLED display, which is something you typically don’t find in phones this cheap. Colors are rich and vibrant, while its peak brightness of 670 nits is also quite impressive for a budget device. The only thing people might take issue with out of the box is that the Pixel 4a’s screen has a slightly warmer color temperature than most phones, but that’s easily adjusted in the phone’s display settings. And while the Pixel 4a doesn’t boast the world’s fastest phone performance, with a score of 231 on WebXPRT 2015, the 4a is more than fast enough for all but the most extreme power users, while still offering more speed than other budget phones like the TCL 10 (174) and Moto G Power (171).Another perk of the Pixel 4a not normally found on other budget phones is true stereo audio, which combines the phone’s bottom-mounted speaker with its earpiece to produce balanced and rich, but not terribly loud audio. And for people still rocking wired headphones, there’s a handy 3.5mm jack too.However, the Pixel 4a’s real standout feature is its camera, because even though it only has a single image sensor in back, it has practically the same kind of image quality you get from a standard Pixel 4, along with all of Google’s special photo modes including astrophotography, time-lapse, and most importantly, Night Sight. In short, the Pixel 4a has the best camera you can get on a smartphone for under $800. To test this, I compared shots from the $350 Pixel 4a with photos taken by the $450 OnePlus Nord, which features the same cameras used in the $800 OnePlus 8, and the $700 iPhone 11. Even in well-lit daytime shots that typically don’t pose much of a challenge for a modern smartphone, the Pixel 4a consistently out shot the OP Nord. In a head-to-head comparison between a shot of a some pink flowers, you can see where the OP Nord’s shot suffers from oversaturated colors, resulting in a softer image with funky looking textures. Then later, in a shot of a sunset, the Pixel 4a really flexed its skills by capturing a shot that’s just as rich and colorful as the OnePlus Nord’s, but without completely underexposing the lower half of the photo like the Nord did.Meanwhile, compared to the iPhone 11, while the Pixel 4a wasn’t nearly as dominant, it routinely kept pace with a phone twice its price, and often coming out ahead. For example, in shots of another flower and a local mural, while the iPhone 11's pics immediately jump out thanks to having slightly more vibrant colors, in both comparisons, if you zoom in a bit, you can see where the Pixel 4a did a better job of preserving details on the flower’s petals or  the texture on the mural’s brick wall.Finally, I moved on to even darker low-light situations, where Google’s Night Sight Mode truly shined. In a shot of some graffiti, the iPhone 11 did an impressive job of producing an image with lots of detail and proper exposure, but the iPhone 11 ultimately missed a bit on white balance compared to the Pixel 4a. However, when I captured a very challenging shot of a plushy lit only by a single candle, the Pixel 4a was nothing short of amazing as it captured the most details out of all three phones while also having a more well-exposed image, less grain, and richer and more accurate colors.As for the Pixel 4a’s battery life, while it didn’t quite live up to the 15 hour and 44 minute mark the Moto G Power turned in our streaming video rundown test, with a time a 13:55, the Pixel 4a was still firmly above average. Compared to other budget and mid-range phones, the Pixel 4a beat both the TCL 10L (11:52) and TCL 10 Pro (13:00), and also lasted longer than both of its more expensive siblings, the Pixel 4 (10:38) and Pixel 4 XL (12:36).In the end, my major gripe boils down to one somewhat forgivable omission. That’s because while I’d love to see the Pixel 4a feature a second ultra-wide or telephoto cam—especially when even cheaper like the Moto G Power and TCL 10L both come with dual cams—with Google clearly focusing on simplicity and opting for quality over quantity, the Pixel 4a’s single rear shooter has definitely proven its value. Instead, I really wish the Pixel 4a had some sort of water resistance because while Google says the phone has limited protection against dust and dirt, the Pixel 4a doesn’t have much to guard against moisture. Having an IP rating for water-resistance doesn’t make a phone impervious to water, but when it comes to normal spills and accidents, it does give you more peace of mind when it comes to the phone’s everyday durability.Still, the Pixel 4a feels like a wonderful example of restraint and while also following the legendary KISS principle: Keep it simple, stupid. The Pixel 4a is simple and elegant, and for just $350, it’s damn near impossible to find a better phone in this price range without turning to one of its spec-heavy Chinese rivals which rarely feature support for U.S. networks. If I had a teenage child who needed a phone, I’d buy them a Pixel 4a. Same goes for a grandparent looking for something new but still easy to use, particularly when you factor in all of the Google Assistant various smart features like Call Screener, Live Captions, and the new Crisis Alert check.  Heck, I’d argue a lot of people running around with flagship devices could happily switch to the Pixel 4a without missing much while also saving a bunch of money in the process. I’m not here to tell you how much phone you need, but if you want a good phone for a reasonable price that covers all the basics, the Pixel 4a is an excellent choice. "
25,Huawei p40,https://gizmodo.com/huawei-p40-pro-review-world-class-hardware-that-lacks-1844182785,"It’s a weird situation when the second largest smartphone maker in the world is treated as persona non grata, but that’s precisely what Huawei is facing when it comes to selling gadgets in the U.S. And based on the current political climate, there’s very little chance that will change between now and November. However, that doesn’t mean Huawei’s latest flagship phone—the P40 Pro—isn’t worth checking out. Because even though the P40 Pro isn’t officially sold in the U.S. and its lack of support for Google Mobile Services can be a real pain sometimes (more on that later), it also has world-class components and some of the best cameras you can get on a phone.Priced at 1,000 euros (around $1,100), the P40 Pro is actually the middle option among Huawei’s current flagship phone lineup, with the more expensive 1,400 euro ($1,600) P40 Pro+ offering a few extra luxury options including a 10x optical zoom cam, faster 40-watt wireless charging (versus 27-watt charging for the P40 Pro), and a special ceramic back. But aside from that, the two devices are quite similar, with the P40 Pro  actually boasting a slightly larger 6.58-inch screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, which is a first Huawei.From the moment you pick up the P40 Pro, it feels more like an expensive watch than a typical gadget. It has a noticeable heft and density that you don’t find in a lot of other phones, and it’s clear Huawei has paid a lot of attention to the P40 Pro’s finish with little accents like the red line on the power buttons and the corners of its chassis, which rise up and reach around to form what Huawei calls its quad-curve overflow display. It’s a really elegant look that also has a functional purpose, because by extending the sides of the P40 Pro’s screen almost halfway down the side of the phone, you get a really smooth, curvy surface when using Huawei’s gesture navigation, making swiping in from either side to go back or swiping up to home a treat every time you do it. And because the display’s edges are quite steep compared to other phones with rounded screens, the P40 Pro doesn’t suffer as much from distortion. In short, if you’re going to put a curvy screen on a phone, the P40 Pro is a great example of how to do it right.As for the screen itself, I think Huawei made a smart decision by splitting the difference between full HD and 4K and going with a 2640 x 1200 resolution, which means the phone doesn’t have to work as hard when playing games, but without having a resolution so low you can make out individual pixels. And with its OLED panel, the P40 Pro’s screen is both bright and wonderfully colorful.Meanwhile, on the inside, you get Huawei’s Kirin 990 chip, 8GB of RAM, and at least 128GB of storage, offering plenty of room for stashing pics and videos locally along with strong performance. You also have a speedy in-screen fingerprint sensor and even support for 5G too, but because the P40 Pro wasn’t intended for sale in the U.S., you can’t really use it on local 5G networks like those from Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile. Huawei even tossed in a few features you don’t really get on other flagship phones anymore including an IR blaster.Unfortunately, the P40 has a few weird quirks too. Because Huawei opted for an under-the-screen earpiece speaker for listening to calls, the phone only has a single mono speaker for normal playback duties. It’s not a big deal, but considering practically every other phone in this price range sports at least stereo audio, the P40 Pro’s lackluster speaker feels like a partial miss. Also, while the P40 Pro does have expandable storage, the phone uses special Huawei Nano memory cards, which means your standard microSD card won’t fit.But the real stars on the P40 Pro are its cameras. The main camera uses a huge 1/1.28-inch 50-MP sensor, with the phone also packing a 12-MP telephoto cam with a 5x optical zoom, a 40-MP ultra-wide cam, and a 3D time-of-flight sensor for good measure. In bright light, the P40 Pro delights with sharp, rich photos that match or sometimes exceed anything the Pixel 4 can capture. My only real gripe is that sometimes Huawei’s processing pushes exposure a bit too far so that in certain scenarios like my shot of a nearby mural, you lose a bit a detail like on the texture of the wall.But at night is when the Huawei’s camera really impresses. In a head-to-head shootout of a flower in low-light, while the P40 Pro didn’t produce the same, vivid shade of blue as the Pixel 4 XL did, it did capture an overall sharper photo. And when it comes to editing, it’s easier to adjust color than focus. However, the shot that impressed me the most was probably the P40 Pro’s shot of a fountain at night. Based on the photo, you’d have a hard time telling how dark it was in real life, and even so, the P40 Pro’s picture sports more details and is just generally sharper than the Pixel 4 XL’s pic. When it comes to photography, the P40 Pro is every bit of a match for Google’s best, and with that 5x optical zoom and a boatload of special modes and features, it’s got a better overall toolkit than the Pixel 4 too.Sadly, now we have to get to the P40 Pro’s biggest weakness, it’s lack of support for Google apps and Google Mobile Services. Not only does this mean you don’t have access to the Google Play Store (along with any content you may have purchased there), apps that rely on Google Mobile Services don’t work either. Right off the bat that eliminates a lot of really handy apps like YouTube, Drive, Photos, and Google Maps, but it also prohibits you from syncing a number of games that rely on Google Play to transfer profiles or store saved game info.Instead, your main source of new apps is Huawei’s App Gallery, which is a growing marketplace for apps designed to run on Huawei devices. But even there a lot of big third-party apps like Twitter, Whatsapp, Philips Hue, and others are missing. Now it’s true you can circumvent some of these restrictions by sideloading apps or using Huawei’s Phone Clone app to carry over apps from your old Android phone to the P40 Pro. This worked to bring Twitter over, but there are still a lot of omissions. Furthermore, while it is possible with a lot of effort and a not-insignificant amount of expertise to add Google Mobile Services to a Huawei phone, these loopholes don’t tend to last very long, which makes it feel like you are constantly running tech support on your daily driver.In fact, because our traditional video rundown test uses YouTube, I couldn’t even run a proper battery life test on the P40 Pro. So while I was more than happy with its typical everyday longevity, I’m not able to make the same sort of battery life comparisons I usually do. The mapping situation on Huawei phones is especially dire. Obviously you don’t have access to Apple Maps, and with Google Maps also removed from consideration (along with Waze and the rely on Google mapping info), there simply aren’t any great options left to choose from. Even TomTom, which is supposed to be Huawei’s new mapping provider, isn’t available in the App Gallery yet. For a lot of people, especially those of us in the U.S., this is a huge sticking point, because even though the P40 Pro’s hardware is great, the inability to run many of my most commonly used apps is a huge dealbreaker. It’s a sad state of affairs, because otherwise, the P40 Pro would pose a wonderful alternative to a Galaxy S20+ or an iPhone 11 Pro. I have no doubt that in the future the app selection in Huawei’s App Gallery will improve and Huawei might even at some point get removed from the Entity List, but right now, the lack of support for tons of popular apps means the P40 Pro sort of feels like a lost generation for people in the west."
26,TCL 10 Pro,https://gizmodo.com/tcl-10-pro-review-the-most-overlooked-deal-in-phones-1843706004,"TCL makes everything from air conditioners to soundbars to washing machines, but here in the U.S., unless people are talking about TCL’s cheap TVs, no one really cares. Look, I get it, TCL doesn’t have the same kind of draw or recognition as other electronics giants like Apple or Samsung. But at the same time, TCL does have a lot of experience when it comes to phones thanks to managing brands including Alcatel, Palm, and even the last few generations of Blackberry phones (until TCL and Blackberry parted ways earlier this year). And on the new $450 TCL 10 Pro, TCL is taking the same approach it’s used on its beloved cheap TVs, resulting in what might be the most feature-packed handset in its price range, and possibly one of the best phone deals you can get right now.Having said all that, I admit TCL hasn’t done itself any favors with the 10 Pro’s looks, because while the phone sports a premium-feeling design thanks to TCL’s use of metal and smooth, curvy glass, the phone ends up looking a lot like a  Galaxy S10 knock-off. For a $450 phone, that’s actually a compliment. When you take a closer look, you start to notice clever little design tweaks like the phone’s totally flush rear cameras and the smoky matte finish on the glass in back. (There’s also a dark green model that looks even better than our gray review unit.) And while some people have remarked that the 10 Pro’s metal sides can feel a bit sharp, I find that where the phone’s metal band meets its glass back creates an edge that makes the phone a bit easier to grip.But where the TCL 10 Pro really impresses are all the little components and features that you normally don’t get on a phone this cheap. Not only does the 10 Pro come with an in-display fingerprint reader, but it also features a built-in IR blaster (something you don’t even get on most $1,000 flagships today), a big 6.47-inch AMOLED display (which produces vivid colors and deep blacks), a microSD card slot, and even good ‘ole headphone jack. TCL even tossed in an old-school notification light and the ability to reverse charge other gadgets by simply plugging in a USB-C cable. Also, for anyone worried about protecting the phone, the 10 Pro comes with a clear plastic case in the box. The only things people might want that the 10 Pro doesn’t offer are Qi wireless charging and an official IP rating for water resistance, but considering the phone’s price, I think those are very reasonable omissions. On the inside, the 10 Pro’s specs look good too, with the phone sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 chip, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of base storage. Sure, these components won’t blow anyone away with sky high benchmark numbers, but in normal use, the phone is surprisingly smooth and doesn’t suffer from the kind of stutters and hiccups you often encounter on a lot of budget and mid-range devices. And thanks to its sizable 4,500 mAh battery, the 10 Pro performed admirably during our video rundown test, turning in a battery life of 13 hours flat. That’s 20 minutes more than what we got from the Pixel 4 XL (12:36) and the same as what we saw on the iPhone 11 Pro. Not bad at all.TCL has also kept the 10 Pro’s build of Android 10 relatively clean, which means switching over isn’t quite as jarring as it might be when compared to a lot of the more heavily-skinned Chinese handsets. I also have to give props to TCL for including handy little apps like Smart Key. It super easy to customize the 10 Pro’s programmable button, which sits on the left side of the device. Meanwhile, the only things you can really classify as bloat are the pre-installed Facebook and Netflix apps.Around back, the 10 Pro also sports a total of four cameras, which is more than what most phones twice its price get: there’s a big 64-MP main cam, a 16-MP ultra-wide cam, a 5-MP macro cam, and a 2-MP depth cam for helping out with bokeh and various portrait mode effects. Now I’m not going to say that the 10 Pro can match something like an iPhone or even a Pixel 3a in pure image quality, but compared to the $700 OnePlus 8, the 10 Pro more than holds its own. In both bright and low-light environments, the 10 Pro regularly captured photos that were brighter, sharper, and more colorful than the OnePlus 8. The 10 Pro’s only major issue is inconsistency with its white balance, which causes the phone to produce pics with overly warm color casts that accentuate yellow, orange, and red tones. Honestly, in a lot of ways, the 10 Pro’s biggest problem seems to be TCL’s inferiority complex, which makes it feel like the phone is trying extra hard to be noticed. You can see this in things like the automatic watermark on the 10 Pro’s camera app, which is turned on by default and something I failed to notice until after I had shot all my test photos. It’s been years since the whole “Shot on X phone” trend meant anything, and while you can disable the watermark in settings, it never should have been turned on in the first place.Furthermore, because of its experience making TV displays, TCL is trying to push its NXTVISION platform using a pre-installed app that allows you to change color modes, enhance standard def content for playback on the 10 Pro’s display, and a couple other visual enhancements. And while playing around with the settings in the NXTVISION app does have a subtle effect on your viewing experience, it’s not exactly the mind blowing upgrade people might be expecting. Instead, I wish TCL spent less time trying to push its corporate synergy and invested a bit more effort into things like allowing the phone’s earpiece to also double as a second speaker so that the phone could deliver richer stereo audio instead of the one-sided mono sound it actually has. Still, if you can get past the small amount of crowing and chest puffing, the 10 Pro is just a simple, well-built phone with a big bag of tools at a really good price, which is all people actually want from a good mid-range device. The sad thing is that even after all of this, a lot of people are still going to sleep on the TCL 10 Pro, which is a shame, because just like its cheap TV’s, this thing feels like a steal."
27,Motorala Edge,https://gizmodo.com/motorola-edge-review-the-best-battery-life-ever-but-1843166616,"On paper, Moto’s return to the flagship phone world with the $1,000 Edge+ seems like it’s got all the right stuff. For $200 less than a Galaxy S20+, you’re practically getting the same assortment of specs including a 6.7-inch OLED screen, Snapdragon 865 chip, 12GB of RAM (which is 4GB more than what you get from Samsung), and full 5G support. You also get handy bonuses like a headphone jack, a higher res 108-MP main camera, and a massive 5,000 mAh battery. However, after stepping away from the high-end phone market for the last couple years, it seems like Motorola has forgotten how to properly refine and polish a premium device. And when you consider that the Edge+ is a Verizon exclusive, I fear Moto has created a good phone with limited appeal.Let’s start with the good stuff first. When it comes to performance, the Edge+ is a beast. It’s 12GB of RAM is more than anyone really needs, even when multitasking between a bunch of apps and games, the Edge+ never seems strained. And on benchmark tests, the Edge+ routinely performed 5 to 10 percent better than the OnePlus 8 Pro, which is no small feat considering fast and fluid performance has been one of OnePlus’ calling cards for years. The Edge+ also comes with 256GB of storage standard, so there’s plenty of room to squirrel photos, videos, or anything else you might want away. Though the tradeoff there is that unlike the S20+, the Edge+ doesn’t have a microSD card slot.Meanwhile, the Edge+’s 90Hz display offers a good middle ground between standard 60Hz panels and the 120Hz screens used by Samsung, OnePlus, and others. That 90Hz refresh means everything you do looks just a little bit smoother, letting you appreciate little details like the animation of an app opening or the way text glides down the screen while browsing the web. Moto’s 6.7-inch OLED screen also produces colorful images under normal conditions, though its peak brightness of 495 nits could be better.On top of that, the Edge+’s 90Hz display is less power-hungry than its 120Hz brethren, which when combined with its huge 5,000 mAh battery resulted in it lasting 17 hours and 18 minutes in our battery test, which makes the Edge+ the longest-lasting phone we’ve ever tested. This thing’s got some serious runtime.The Edge+ is also somewhat forward-thinking with support for both Verizon’s existing mmWave 5G network and Verizon’s upcoming sub-6GHz rollout. I was even able to find a pocket of Verizon’s mmWave 5G network a few blocks from my home, letting me hit download speeds of over 500 Mbps, which is 10 times faster than traditional 4G LTE speeds. It’s kind of nice seeing new bubbles of 5G pop up recently, but mmWave 5G still has a hard time penetrating walls, so even if you have Verizon 5G in your area, it only really works outside. Those speeds aren’t quite as useful as they might seem.Motorola also says the Edge+’s dual speakers are the loudest of any phone ever, and while I can’t confirm if that’s true or not as I don’t have every phone ever sitting in front of me, they do certainly pack a punch. Unfortunately, what the Edge+ brings in volume is sort of canceled out by just decent audio quality, which tends to sound a bit hollow or shallow for my tastes. The Edge+ might be a touch louder, but Moto still isn’t really dunking on Samsung’s Galaxy S20+. That said, the Edge+ does have a headphone jack, which is something almost no other high-end phones have anymore (aside from the LG V60). And with the quarantine keeping me largely confined indoors, I’ve found quite that 3.5mm jack quite useful when paired with the wired closed-back headphones I usually wear at home, allowing me drown out distracting sounds in the background.So why am I not in love with this phone? The big issue with the Moto Edge+ is how it feels and functions during everyday use. If you swipe up from the bottom of the phone on the home screen, you’re more likely to open up the recent apps screen than the phone’s app drawer—something that feels especially strange as the Edge+ features a mostly stock Android UI. To avoid this, you have to make sure you don’t actually touch the very bottom of the screen, and instead start your swipe around the bottom row of app icons. But what makes the phone feel even more awkward is its design. Thanks to its large camera module in back, anytime you tap the phone while it’s resting on a flat surface, it tends to rock back and forth like an annoying table with uneven legs. If you shake the Edge+, you’ll also notice that the phone produces a rattle, which is a side effect caused by ball bearings in the phone’s optical image stabilization system. Moto claims the rattle won’t harm or damage the phone, which is nice I guess, but like a loose door handle on a new car, that noise doesn’t make you feel great about your shiny new purchase.Furthermore, the metal band that runs around the outside of the phone that joins the front and back glass sticks out like a ridge, which when combined with the bigger battery inside, leaves the Edge+ feeling significantly more clunky to hold and use than the Galaxy S20+. And while I didn’t have a ton of issues using Moto’s curvy “Endless Edge” screen which wraps halfway down the side of the phone, the extreme bends causes some issues when using a number of apps or simply browsing the web. On Gizmodo’s mobile site, parts of our top navigation bar flow down into the curve, which means if you want to browse over to Earther (which you should), you have to tap the very side of the screen. And even when there aren’t UI elements hanging over each side, the extra curvy display can cause some serious visual distortion. I also noticed some situations where the Edge+ would get stuck in landscape mode and refuse to switch back without excessive swiping and pawing at its screen. I’m still not sure why this happens, but it’s behavior when switching between landscape and portrait orientation is unlike almost any other Android phone I’ve used recently.Moto tries to utilize its Endless Edge screen by lighting up the sides of the phone when you get certain notifications (like a text message) or charge the phone, which is nice. But this is something Samsung has been doing for years, and aside from  letting you use the edge of the phone as virtual buttons while gaming, Moto doesn’t seem to have brought a lot of other innovation to the party.Now I would be remiss not to mention that you can disable the Endless Edge effect via a simple toggle in the phone’s display settings. In fact, the Edge+ will even turn off the Endless Edge automatically when it’s low on juice, to help extend its battery life. The problem is that if you’re buying a phone only to disable one of its highlight features,  what’s the point?Another frustrating screen issue is that when you look at the phone in the dark room with the brightness turned down, the phone suffers from black crush and a green tint that makes  the entire display look somewhat grainy. And if you turn the phone’s built-in dark mode on, when you look at the settings menu, you can easily see how the phone has trouble maintaining a consistent background color across its screen. These are all things you really shouldn’t have to deal with on something that’s supposed to be a high-end device.But what might frustrate some folks even more is that Moto won’t commit to supporting the Edge+ with major software updates beyond Android 11. Moto says “We will support with software updates as frequently and for as long as we feel it benefits our consumers. While we don’t have an absolute commitment to numbers of upgrades, edge consumers can expect security updates every other month and an upgrade to Android 11 OS this year. Additionally, we’re looking to the Play Store updates to bring new features and address consumer concerns faster.” That’s not a bad commitment for a cheaper phone, but for any flagship phone, two major software updates should be the bare minimum. No excuses.As for its cameras, the Edge+ delivers some of the most up and down performance I’ve seen on a phone in a while. In bright light, the Edge+ largely delivers, boasting sharp, high-res photos that don’t leave much room for complaining. And if you’re someone who really enjoys pixel peeping, you can enable the Edge+’s full 108-MP sensor to capture pics with massive resolution. Otherwise, the Edge+ uses pixel binning to increase quality, leaving you with 25-MP photos by default, which is still twice the resolution of most of its competitors.If you look close though, you will notice that the Edge+’s colors aren’t as saturated and don’t pop like what you’d get from a Galaxy S20+. I also prefer daytime photos taken by the Pixel 4, as Google tends to do a better job nailing white balance and contrast. Even so, it’s clear Moto has made a lot of progress when it comes to camera quality.Unfortunately, in low light situations, the Edge+ gets weird. Without its dedicated Night Vision mode turned on, the Edge+ shot some very lackluster pics. In a head-to-head against the OnePlus 8 Pro, both phones were blurry and lacked a lot of detail to the point where it became a contest to decide which pic looked worse. Basically, if it’s dark out and you don’t turn the phone’s Night Vision mode on, you’re at risk of capturing a disappointing photo. When you do get around to enabling Night Vision, which not coincidentally the phone will routinely prompt you to do, image quality significantly improves. In a shot of a nearby mural, the Edge+ easily kept pace with the S20+, with the two phones only capturing minor differences in white balance. And when I pitted the Edge+ against the Pixel 4 XL in a candlelight only photo, while the Pixel 4 XL still came out on top, the Edge+ wasn’t that far behind. Motorola says it put a lot of work into the Edge+’s HDR processing, and it shows, with a number of its phones showing strong dynamic range while capturing more detail in the shadows.The Edge+ is a maddening device because underneath all these minor issues, there is a solid phone waiting for some tweaks. However, the bigger problem for Moto is that if you just want a fast, powerful phone with decent cameras and a 90Hz screen, the OnePlus 8 is also available on Verizon for $300 less. The main things you lose on out are a headphone jack and a 3x telephoto zoom. And if you aren’t thirsty for performance, the Pixel 4 can be had for even less than that. That makes the Edge+ a hard sell.On the flip side, when it comes to high-end phones, the Galaxy S20+ remains without a doubt the best premium Android phone. Its screen is better and it supports a 120Hz refresh rate. Its cameras are also better, particularly in low light. Most importantly, it has the kind of refinement you expect on a high-end handset. You can touch and feel where that extra $200 went.All this leaves the Edge+ in an awkward spot. In some respects, it’s hard to blame Motorola for releasing a $1,000 device when spending time outside or on-the-go is something people can’t really do. There’s no way Moto could have predicted covid-19 a year or two ago when it probably started designing this phone. But at the same time, if you’re going to make a lot of noise about getting back in the premium phone game, you have to go hard, and make sure it can hang with the best. And even with a price tag that’s $200 less than its biggest rival, the Edge+ lack of polish makes it hard to get excited about. "
28,Apple Iphone SE,https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-se-review-this-is-the-iphone-to-buy-right-1843119180,"Rumors of a cheaper, smaller iPhone swirled for years before Apple actually announced the $400 second-gen iPhone SE this month, so it’s likely that the company has long been planning to release a successor to its popular pint-sized iPhone. But the iPhone SE is so much a gadget of this specific moment in time that, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think Apple rushed its release. The SE looks like an iPhone 8, complete with tiny 4.7-inch display, giant bezels, and a home button with Touch ID. But inside is Apple’s A13 Bionic processor, lifted straight from the iPhone 11 lineup, which makes everything about the SE faster and smarter. Even the cameras, which are the same ones used in the iPhone 8, get an upgrade due to the processor.I don’t consider the new iPhone to be a true SE successor, because it’s not a truly tiny phone. Those days are gone, and they’re not coming back. But the second-gen SE is better than I anticipated, and the best iPhone for most people right now.Things are weird right now. When I received an iPhone SE review unit, I realized I couldn’t test its cameras the way I normally would—low-lit nights out with friends, crowded beach days, or scenic LA hikes. I had to shoot around my apartment, on my balcony, and on the street in front of my building (with a mask on, while remaining six feet from others). I didn’t expect to be all that impressed with the SE’s photos. After all, the newest iPhone is using the 3-year-old iPhone 8's 12-megapixel rear camera lens and its 7-megapixel front-facing one, an iFixIt teardown confirmed. But that A13 Bionic processor is kinda magical. Its image signal processor and neural engine, paired with iOS 13, are enough to overcome many of the hardware shortfalls (different sensors, no telephoto or ultra-wide-angle rear lenses, and no depth-sensing lens on the front) to create images that are often on par with what you’d see from the iPhone 11 Pro Max—which, at $700 more than the SE, is Apple’s priciest iPhone.I compared the SE to the Max (the only 11 model I have on hand due to quarantine) and was pleasantly surprised, particularly with the cheaper phone’s portraits. The smart HDR also makes backlit shots more detailed.But the SE lacks a dedicated Night Mode or the Pro’s Deep Fusion feature, and in low light, color and detail are lost. The SE’s 5x digital zoom falls short of the 11 Pro Max’s 2x optical and 10x digital zoom. As you can see in the shots below, the SE is very good at most things, particularly for its low price, but if you want an amazing camera for nighttime and telephoto shots, you’ll need to spend more. Much more.The fact that the SE can hold its own against the 11 Pro Max in a variety of scenarios is impressive. When you look around at the $400 smartphone landscape, very few cheap phones’ images rival a flagship’s. In fact, the only one I can think of is Google’s Pixel 3a, which is also a great budget phone, but I’m not sure how many people are still trying to decide between iPhone and Android. With the world what it is, I realized that Touch ID, which has come to seem outdated to me, is incredibly useful now that Face ID doesn’t work when I’m wearing a mask.Touch ID is faster than I remember it being, though I haven’t used it since I upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus to an iPhone XS. I appreciated being able to pull my phone out at a grocery store or my corner bodega to use Apple Pay without having to type in my passcode to authenticate the transaction. Will I appreciate this when I no longer have to cover my face in public? Maybe not.What I really want is a 4.7-inch iPhone that is almost entirely screen, with an in-display fingerprint sensor as a backup unlocking method and wildly good cameras—an iPhone 12 Pro Mini, if you will. And ideally, I’d get all that for $400. Clearly, that’s not gonna happen. After a few days, the SE’s thick bezels didn’t bother me much. But the SE’s screen size felt cramped to me, even after a week. I wanted the expansive display I’ve grown used to on the XS and 11 Pro. If you’re upgrading from an iPhone 8 (or an older phone, the like the 6s or 7), the screen size won’t bother you.And for $400, you do get a ton of features that make those bezels worth the trade-off. When it comes to performance, the SE felt every bit as fast as my daily driver, the iPhone XS, which has a 2018-era A12 Bionic chip. The SE’s A13 Bionic powers the great photos you saw above, but also some pretty neat augmented reality apps and ultra-smooth gaming. The SE’s glass design also enables wireless charging, which is rare in a sub-$500 phone. (You don’t get that with the Pixel 3a.) Anecdotally, the SE’s battery life lasted a full, 16-hour day (and then some) in my week of testing. I watched YouTube videos, sent Slack messages, streamed music while working out, and Instagrammed more than a healthy person probably should—hey, quarantine ain’t easy. In our video rundown test, the iPhone SE lasted a little over 9 hours, which is in line with the iPhone 8 before it. If you need a longer-lasting iPhone, the Pro models are the ones to buy. The $700 iPhone 11 is also a solid, if more expensive, alternative and lasted 12 hours in our testing. So for $300 more you get better battery life, a bigger screen, dual lenses instead of the triple-lens system on the Pro models, but also Night mode and Deep Fusion for Pro-level quality photos. The problem, besides being $300 more, is the 6.1-inch 11 is massive, and that will make a huge difference for many people. Would I choose the iPhone SE over the 11, the 11 Pro, or whichever $1,000 iPhone comes out this fall? No, but that’s more due to the demands of my job than the SE’s failings. Its price and features are perfectly designed for this uncertain time, when  people are focused more on staying healthy and keeping their jobs and homes than balling out on flagship phones. Living without a smartphone is basically nonnegotiable the year of our lord 2020, so if you need a new device and you’re watching your wallet, the iPhone SE is the budget phone to beat."
29,Oneplus 8,https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-8-review-this-is-the-android-phone-for-most-pe-1842857418,"When OnePlus first started selling phones back in 2014, it positioned its devices as flagship killers, offering similar specs and performance as high-end phones from Samsung, Google, and others, but for half the price. Later, as OnePlus grew and matured, even though its phones may not have offered quite the same level of savings, OnePlus began challenging the big brands with things like faster updates, cleaner, more streamlined builds of Android, and high refresh rate displays. Now skip ahead to today, where thanks to the decline and disappearance of longtime industry mainstays like LG and HTC—often at the hands of OnePlus—and the arrival of the new OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro, it feels like the once plucky contender with a chip on its shoulder is finally ready to take its place on the main stage. OnePlus, welcome to primetime.That said, there is an important downside to all this, because after graduating from being a small volume phone maker that catered to nerds and enthusiasts, the $900 OnePlus 8 Pro is tied with the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren as the most expensive OnePlus phone ever. And while the standard OnePlus 8 Pro offers a bit of relief with a starting price of $700, that’s still a noticeable jump up from last year’s $600 OnePlus 7T, which was one of the best all-around smartphone values of 2019.Still, what you get for the money feels like a great deal, especially compared to the Galaxy S20 where the cheapest model starts at $1,000, and goes all the way up to $1,400 for the S20 Ultra. Both the OP8 and OP8 Pro feature the same base guts including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, plus an in-screen optical fingerprint sensor. And for an extra $100, you can bump up the specs on either phone to 12GB of memory and 256GB of on-board storage. Both phones also sport very similar glass sandwich designs with rounded corners, metal bands around the sides, and sloped, curvy screens, which are actually a bit curvier than what you get on a Galaxy S20. OnePlus has also shifted away from the motorized pop-up selfie cams it used last year in favor of a 16-MP punch-hole selfie camera in the top left corner.And then there’s the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro’s new colors, which are easily the company’s best selection of colorways yet. The standard OP8 is available in Glacial Green and Interstellar Glow, which features an iridescent finish that shifts from orange to purple, while the OP8 Pro comes in black, green, and an enchanting Ultramarine Blue, which might be my favorite of the bunch.From there, things start to diverge, with the OnePlus 8 featuring a 6.55-inch 2400 x 1080 display with a 90Hz refresh rate, a 4,300 mAh battery, and three rear cameras: a 48-MP main cam, a 16-MP ultra-wide cam, and a 2-MP macro cam. Meanwhile, the OP8 Pro has gotten a number of important upgrades including a 6.78-inch 3168 x 1440 with an even faster 120Hz refresh rate (just like the Galaxy S20 line), larger 4,510 mAh battery, and four rear cameras: a 48-MP main cam  (with a new Sony IMX 680 sensor), an 8-MP telephoto camera with a 3x lossless zoom, a 48-MP ultra-wide cam, and what OnePlus is calling a color filter camera (more on that later).But one of the most surprising changes is that after years of dinging OnePlus for only offering wired charging on its phones, the OnePlus 8 Pro now supports Qi wireless charging that has been tuned specifically for use with the company’s new Warp Charge 30 wireless charger. That means not only can you drop the OP8 Pro on any normal wireless charging pad in a pinch, but when combined with OnePlus’ stand, you get some of the fastest wireless charging speeds on the market.OnePlus says that by using a low voltage combined with multiple charging pumps, it can achieve a charging efficiency of around 97 perfect, which is significantly better than the 75 to 85 percent efficiency you’d get from a regular Qi charging pad. All told, this results in some damn fast wireless charging that  added 46 percent extra battery (from 10 to 56 percent) after 30 minutes. However, when it comes to pure recharging speeds, wired still reigns supreme because with the same 30 minute charging window, OnePlus’s included Warp Charge 30 power brick added 66 percent charge (from 10 to 76 percent). Regardless, even though OnePlus took a little longer to jump on the wireless charging trend than some other phone makers, I’m quite satisfied with how things have turned on the OP8 Pro.The speed and fluidity of OnePlus phones has been one of the company’s biggest strengths, which is something the OP8 and OP8 Pro showcase in full force. Between a number of OS optimizations and either 90Hz or 120HZ screens (which are a real delight btw), both phones are a joy to use. Everything feels incredibly snappy, and combined with OnePlus being one of the faster phones makers when it comes to pushing out new software updates, OnePlus phones deliver the best Android experience of any phone not made by Google.The OP8 Pro’s 120Hz display, in particular, is a real treat. It looks just as good as what you get on the S20+ (which has a similar-sized 6.7-inch screen, but for $100 more). It’s bright, smooth, and when combined with the sped up animations in Oxygen OS and an upgraded 240Hz touch sampling rate, it’s hard not to love the OP8 Pro’s 120Hz screen. Furthermore, with 8GB or 12GB of RAM to work with and a Snapdragon 865 chip, both phones offer an abundance of pep, regardless of if you’re gaming or simply switching between social media or all the video calls you might be dropping in on.I’m also a big fan of OnePlus’ new adaptive wallpapers, which automatically adjust to suit your environment and lighting conditions, and even works with the phone’s night mode to help prevent unnecessary blue light from messing with your sleep patterns.The one new software feature that for this go around that OnePlus didn’t really nail is its new motion smoothing video option, which seeks to upgrade 24 or 30 fps videos into footage that can better take advantage of the phones’ high refresh rate screens. But in my experience on both YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, I found the effect largely hit or miss. And because there’s not a great way to quickly toggle motion smooth on or off without diving into the phones’ settings menus, I ended up just turning it off and leaving it that way.Previously, one of the biggest things holding OnePlus back from truly contending with other top-tier Android phones makers was its camera quality. Camera performance was never bad enough to be a deal-breaker, but it wasn’t exactly a selling point either. And with its two latest phones, OnePlus has taken a big step closer to matching its competition, while also throwing some weird superfluous extras in there too.In daytime conditions, both phones performed well, capturing sharp pics with bright colors and only small differences in things like white balance and color saturation, despite the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro featuring two different 48-MP main sensors. But as with most high-end phones today, the real test comes in low-light, where both the Galaxy S20+ and especially the Pixel 4 still have a noticeable advantage.In one weird head-to-head shot of a church, the standard OnePlus 8 flubbed its white balance badly, resulting in an extremely yellow shot that would get rejected by almost anyone. Though in the OP8's defense, that was the only time I noticed it messed up that bad.When I tried shooting an empty street late at night, things were much closer, with the OP8 Pro edging out the vanilla OP8 picture thanks to a slightly brighter exposure that revealed more details in the shadows. However, if you compare both of the OnePlus 8's shots to a Galaxy S20+, it’s clear there’s still room for improvement.And in really low-light situations, the Pixel 4 XL’s Night Sight still reigns supreme after capturing a night time shot of a flower with significantly more detail, even if its longer exposure meant there was some added blurriness near the center of the frame.Sadly, the bonus cameras on both phones—the macro on the OP8 and the color filter camera on the OP8 Pro—ended up feeling really gimmicky. The macro camera on the OP8 is hard to focus and depending on your subject, if you try to get really close, the size of the phone blocks a lot of your light. Meanwhile, because the color filter camera on the OP8 Pro only has four filters to choose from, it doesn’t add much to your overall toolkit, so until OnePlus adds some more, the feature is pretty forgettable.One of the big upsides of OnePlus’ many tweaks and optimizations is that the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro really sip power when doing things like watching videos— something that allowed both phones to turn in some of the longest battery lives we’ve ever seen on our battery rundown test. The standard OnePlus 8 posted a time of 16 hours and 9 minutes, while the OnePlus 8 Pro fared even better at 16 hours and 45 minutes. Both times are way better than the 12:36 we got from the Pixel 4 XL, and even topped the 15:56 we saw from the Galaxy S20+.However, in real life if you’re connected to 5G or you have 90Hz or 120Hz mode turned on, you’re looking at at least two to three hours less of real-world runtime, especially if you enable 120Hz mode at the OnePlus 8 Pro’s max QHD+ resolution.As always, both phones will be available directly from OnePlus as unlocked devices. But for spring 2020, Verizon is joining T-Mobile as one of the two carriers that will sell the standard OnePlus 8 (but not the OnePlus 8 Pro) in retail stores. However, in order to simply get on store shelves, OnePlus had to make a few changes. So while the unlocked OP8 doesn’t have an official rating for dust or water resistance, both the T-Mobile and Verizon models will feature an IP68 rating. On top of that, while all versions of the OP8 and OP8 Pro support sub-6GHz 5G, the Verizon OP8 will also support mmWave 5G (which is the only kind of 5G Verizon’s network supports right now). This is important to know because if you try to bring an unlocked OP8 to Verizon on your own, it won’t have access to 5G, which may be something to consider down the road as 5G becomes more widely available. Unfortunately, due to the cost of getting the OP8 IP certified and adding support for mmWave 5G, the Verizon OP8 will cost $100 more than the unlocked model at $800. While the two phones are separated in price by $200, both have definitely earned their place as some of the best phones on the market. At $700, the standard OnePlus is a worthy followup to the OP7T and fills a gap in the market left after Samsung failed to make a Galaxy S20e. It’s a great blend of performance and specs, offering a large and vivid 90Hz OLED display in addition to flagship specs and a sleeker, more curvy design. For everyone who has been scared off by Samsung’s $1,000+ Galaxy S20s, this is the Android phone to get. As for the OnePlus 8 Pro, it feels like a budget S20+ in the best way possible. For $300 less, you get the same processor, a gorgeous 6.78-inch 120Hz display (that unlike the S20, can do 120Hz at its max resolution), super-fast wireless charging, and some pretty solid rear cameras. The main things you don’t get are full 5G support and the confidence of an official IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. So while OnePlus 8 offers the best value of the two, the extra 3x telephoto cam on the OnePlus 8 Pro and wireless charging support would have me wanting to upgrade.But more importantly, for a company that seems like it’s finally ready to compete on the same playing field as Samsung and Google, while it’s not an all-out win, these two new phones prove that OnePlus can hang."
30,LG Dual Screen V60,https://gizmodo.com/lgs-dual-screen-v60-is-so-charming-i-dont-mind-its-fla-1842701144,"Life is getting weirder and scarier, and we’re clinging to what we can for happiness. In some of us, that comfort is found in gadgets, and my current comfort gadget is the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. It is so damn cool it makes me forget what’s going on outside, just for a few seconds. Yet as hard as it was to leave this safe haven and step into the brave, not-so-new form factor of the dual-screen LG V60 ThinQ 5G, I’m glad I did. This is a deeply, deeply flawed phone, but it’s packed with the kind of charm that will leave a gadget lover bedazzled.It was enchanting to find productivity so easy and comfortable to pull off, and when I stopped working, it was a delight to play games with a second-screen controller. Even more seductive is the price. $900 gets you both of these screens, and while it may not look as svelte as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, it’s also less than half the price. That doesn’t come without some sacrifices, though.Yes, it’s a bit clunky-looking in the included Dual Screen case, not to mention the notable added weight — the V60 and its case both sport tall, 6.8-inch OLED displays with FHD+ (2460 x 1080) resolutions — but if you’re the type that likes a big phone, the case isn’t the deal-breaker, it’s the star. Besides, you can always leave the case in your bag when we’re all allowed to commute again and snap it on for some quick work or gaming during your commute.At home I found the quirky design to be quite liberating. I was able to easily do research, take notes, and even procrastinate while laying in bed or on the couch. I was very pleased with the work I got done and enthralled with how casually I was able to do it. When a notification came in, I was able to respond to it and get right back to my workflow quickly and easily.At one point, I was at my desk using my laptop with a second monitor when my neck started to hurt. I was writing in two Word documents and browsing the web on the other display, but I closed the laptop, opened up the V60 ThinQ, and in a few taps I was lying in bed doing the same exact thing.Unfortunately, the V60 doesn’t support dual app instances for productivity apps like ZTE’s ill-fated 2017 foldable, the Axon M. You can duplicate messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Telegram, but I had to figure out a workaround for Microsoft’s Office suite. Using the standalone Word app and the new Office 365 all-in-one app, I was able to edit two documents side by side via Android’s native multiwindow function. All the while I had Chrome open on the top screen. I finished my work for the day doing research and taking notes this way for at least an hour.The two-screen design is also more ergonomically pleasing to hold than a tablet. I tried to do the same thing with my iPad Mini, which is roughly the same size as the unfolded V60, but it just couldn’t measure up. The Mini can’t support multitasking with three apps in as usable a way, nor can it run multiple instances of an app. The hinged mechanism of the V60’s second screen also makes it easier to hold because you can bend it, tent it, set it down like a laptop, or even remove it entirely.You will have to get used to a certain level of glitchiness in the dual-screen OS, though, which I did. A beat or two (or sometimes three) of lag was something I came to expect when reorienting the two screens from portrait to landscape or multitasking between them. Animations aren’t always super smooth when multitasking either, and this is where it could’ve really helped to have 12 or 16GB of RAM like most 2020 flagships, rather than the 8GB that LG chose. Still, these were rough edges I was mostly unbothered by after the first day.Enough about work—this thing is also a blast to play games on. Any mobile game that supports controllers will automatically recognize LG’s Game Pad software on the second screen. Crucially, you can also build a gamepad for any game that doesn’t have controller support.It was so satisfying to finally have a controller on my favorite guilty pleasure Gods of Boom (find me at ThisGameStealsMoney) which, like many, resists natively supporting controllers. Setting it up wonked out the game a couple times as I built my controller, but once it was done the gamepad worked flawlessly.The display doesn’t have a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, just the regular 60Hz, but you do have the latest flagship-level Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 running the show, so things run pretty smoothly otherwise. With the FHD+ resolution, text in games can look a bit smudgy, and the lines not so clean, but the overall experience with controller support could mitigate this bit for many.When you’re not using the second display as a gamepad, it’d be nice to watch videos or do some web browsing on the other screen without it automatically pausing the game. Especially with games that make you watch ads, I’d really love to use that second screen to do anything other than give that ad my undivided attention, but alas, short of putting the phone down, I cannot.And how about that camera? Well, it’s not the greatest when it comes to phone photography, but in optimal situations, it can take some decent shots. With a 64-MP main camera, a 13-MP wide-angle, and a ToF (time of flight) sensor for depth information, the V60 can deliver some impressively detailed and accurate shots. But as lighting dwindles, so too does this strong photographic veneer.Color and detail capture are exquisite in daytime. There’s an option to capture in full 64-MP resolution and, at first, I was constantly checking back to make sure I didn’t have this enabled because the default 16-MP photos were coming out so crisp. The camera focuses quickly and adeptly in photo and video capture, so snapping gorgeous pics was pretty effortless, even with a moving subject.I hate my sister’s dogs (except for that angel, Izzy) but I took pictures of them that I truly love.Without a telephoto lens, there’s not much difference when it comes to detail capture in 2x zoom shots versus photos from the iPhone 11 Pro or Pixel 4 which both have 2x optical zoom. At 2x, details are still sharp on the V60, but colors get a tad colder and focus accuracy dips just enough to be somewhat of a nuisance. Get up to 5x zoom on the V60 or iPhone and expect similarly grainy shots, whereas the Pixel 4 maintains its composure better. None of these match up to the 3x, 5x, or even 10x zoom we’ve seen on the Huawei P40 or Galaxy S20’s, though.The V60 does well with color accuracy on both the wide-angle and regular cameras, but it could do a better job of capturing colder tones. This becomes more pronounced in lower-light situations, where the colors can sometimes look greenish, purple-y, or overly warm. Sometimes that wasn’t an issue, though. I’d say about one out of every three came out fine.Dynamic range isn’t the best either. Bright areas can get blown out a bit, as it did in a couple sunset shots I snapped. The V60 also tends to prioritize focus on the brighter part of an image, so tapping to focus on your subject is almost always needed in these lower light situations.Night View, LG’s dedicated night mode on the V60, doesn’t do much better. You can, very rarely, come away with a neat-looking shot, but it can’t pull off the magic iPhones and Pixels do. Even when it gets close there’s often too much trouble with focus, ruining the shot entirely. Don’t expect to capture great photos of the starry night sky with this one. It’s unfortunate to see LG and Samsung still lagging so far behind here, and LG’s making a strong case for last place among the four.As for selfies, the 10-MP front-facing lens doesn’t capture very flattering shots, either. While portrait mode does an alright job of blur application, skin tones come out very yellow and washed out.I ran into the same trouble when shooting videos—even in 8K. In daylight, details looked good and colors did too, albeit a bit cold, but dim the lighting and the quality drops with it. In daytime, even without the super steady mode enabled, it avoids the harsh image jitter we’ve seen in Samsung’s S20’s and is closer to the iPhone 11 Pro’s stabilization, though still a step or two behind.Super steady polishes things up just a smidge more, but it isn’t at the iPhone’s level in terms of mitigating human error while limiting its own computational image aberrations. Get into lower-light situations and you’ll see the iPhone’s video advantages double in every aspect—color, detail, stabilization, the works. 8K on the LG doesn’t look half as good as 4K on the iPhone 11 Pro, and comparing apples to apples, 1080p video is the same story.There is 5G support on the V60 for all three major carriers, but guess who doesn’t have any kind of 5G service where they live? That’s right, me—and probably you, too. Verizon and AT&T’s 5G networks offer particularly sparse coverage, but if you happen to be in T-Mobile’s range, you can get moderately faster connections than you do with LTE. It’s still far short of life-changing at this point, though.With a beefy 5,000 mAh battery, I was able to last about a day and half without charging, on average, but could get a full two days on particularly light usage. Considering this, and the commendable 21 hours (second screen detached), it turned in on our standard battery drain test, it’s a pretty safe bet you’ll get a solid day’s use out of the V60. Running our battery drain test with both screens in use cut this down significantly, to about 12 hours. It’s not likely you’ll be using both screens consistently for 100% of your day, though, so even with mixed usage, I’d expect a full day of battery life.Oh, and you still have to use that silly, easy-to-lose, MagSafe-esque adapter to charge the V60 when it’s in the Dual Screen case. So it’s a good thing I haven’t had to charge it much.I rarely do work on my phone and hate when I have to, but if that were important to me, the V60 ThinQ would be a contender. It’s the one device that actually didn’t send me into immediate laptop withdrawal when I  used it for work. The gaming aspect is another good reason to consider the V60, as the second screen is the simplest way to use a controller on any mobile game, supported or not. It’s not the best camera for every situation, so if a phone’s camera is an important feature for you, you should look elsewhere. But if multitasking is your thing, the V60 ThinQ offers powerful productivity features at less than half the price of anything comparable like Samsung’s array of folding phones.It was a fun little ride taking the V60 ThinQ for a spin, but as someone who loathes big phones, I can’t wait to pop my SIM back in my Z Flip. The V60’s a big phone even without the case attached. And then you pop that on and you’re basically carrying around a folded tablet that’s a better replacement for an iPad or a Kindle Fire than an iPhone or Pixel. It’s a fun device to use, but unless you’re really set on having a tablet that you can fold in half, there’s probably a better use of your $900."
31,Galaxy S20,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-review-a-great-phone-in-a-weird-tim-1842519910,"Samsung’s Galaxy S20 is the company’s most affordable flagship, which isn’t saying much: The 6.2-inch smartphone costs $1,000. It is a very good phone with a very good—dare I say the very best—display of almost any phone on the market (the only better panels being the S20's larger siblings, the S20+ and S20 Ultra). In normal times, I’d say the Galaxy S20 is obviously worth $1,000. These are not normal times. It feels a little bizarre to recommend a $1,000 smartphone when people can’t leave their homes, when unemployment is at record highs, when the last thing anyone cares about is a camera or a processor. But if you need a new phone, and you can find a deal through your carrier, the Galaxy S20 is the Android phone worth buying.The Galaxy S20 just feels good, which is a weird thing to say, but it’s true. It’s narrow but tall, with a slightly rounded display that extends nearly to the edge. If you have smaller hands, like I do, the S20's almost-normal size makes it easier to do basic tasks with just a thumb than it is on larger phones like the absolutely gigantic S20+ (6.7 inches) and S20 Ultra (6.9 inches). I think those phones are far too big.You might prefer the more expansive displays on those larger phones, but the S20's panel is still incredibly stunning, even when I had to settle for the lower full-HD+ resolution to take advantage of the buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate. (Samsung doesn’t support that at the full wide quad-HD resolution, unfortunately.) Scrolling through webpages was a joy, which I cringe to say but is actually true. And I played endless rounds of Asphalt 9, so immersed in the beautiful display (along with my BMW’s racing prowess and my own drifting skills) that I burned almost an entire hour after intending to race only San Francisco.The S20 is also (sort of) future-proofed with a built-in 5G modem. However, the smallest Samsung flagship is only compatible with the low-band sub-6GHz 5G spectrum, which so far has only been widely deployed by T-Mobile. AT&T and Verizon’s 5G networks are built on millimeter-wave spectrum, which offers much faster speeds than you get with low-band but also requires you to stand outside directly beneath a 5G node and angle your phone in the air in such a way as to catch a signal. You can get gigabit speeds when you do that, sure, but it’s not really conducive living your actual life. Using the Galaxy S20, I averaged download speeds of 85 Mbps on T-Mobile’s 5G network—that sounds pitiful, but compared to the 33 Mbps I saw with an iPhone XS on AT&T’s “5GE” network, it’s moderately fast. But true 5G will require a mix of high-, mid-, and low-band spectrum, and the fact that the S20 can’t take advantage of all those spectrums and those ultra-fast speeds is a disadvantage.Like the S20+ and S20 Ultra, the base S20 packs in Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 865 processor, 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, with a microSD slot to expand your storage. There is no headphone jack, for those of you clinging to a world in which smartphone makers care about your wired headphones. (They do not. I’m sorry.)The S20's 4,000 mAh battery sounds beefy, but results in average battery life—15:16 on our video rundown test, which is better than the S20 Ultra (14:41) but not as long-lasting as the S20+ with its 4,500 mAh battery (15:56).The battery difference isn’t quite negligible but for $200 less you get the same exact cameras in the S20 that you do in the S20+: a triple-lens rear camera with a 12-MP wide-angle, 12-MP ultra-wide, and 64-MP telephoto lens with 3x hybrid optical zoom. I tested the S20's zoom with a photograph of the Hollywood sign from a vantage point in nearby Beachwood Canyon. Compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max, the S20's zoom resulted in a smoother image—the iPhone’s zoom captured more true-to-life color, but the sharper details have artifacts that the S20's zoom removes.I also tested the zoom in the S20's Night Mode, comparing it to the Pixel 4's excellent Night Sight and Super Res Zoom in a photograph of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The Pixel was the clear winner in that match-up, though its zoom wasn’t able to get as close to the observatory—the S20's closer angle didn’t result in a better photo because the observatory is pixelated.The S20's Night Mode fared better without zoom in a photo of a Hollywood Regency-style building, though the Pixel 4 once again captured a better shot with more vivid greens in both the building itself and the surrounding trees.I also don’t love the S20's Love Focus (Samsung’s version of Portrait Mode), which I tested in a shot of myself compared to the Pixel 4 and iPhone 11 Pro Max. The iPhone’s image color is more natural, as it usually is, while the S20 gets way too close to my face, despite being positioned in the same exact spot as the other two phones.Another issue I had with the S20's camera was its lag. Switching between various modes in the camera preview occasionally took forever, which isn’t ideal when you’re trying to capture a moment on the fly. Overall, the S20's cameras are fine, though features like Night Hyperlapse and Single Take are gimmicky (and also now available on the S10 and Note 10 with a software update, so there’s no need to upgrade). Samsung has made its flagships’ cameras bloated with features without taking the time to refine the ones people actually use, like Night Mode and Live Focus.The S20 is a good phone despite the shortcomings compared to its pricier siblings. Yet it’s tough to recommend anyone spend $1,000 on anything in the midst of [gestures at literally everything], and I feel slightly tone-deaf suggesting that anyone spend any amount of money on anything during this crisis. But when this passes, and you need to buy a new phone, the S20 is beautiful, fast, and will last you awhile."
32,Galaxy S20 ,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-review-the-best-new-high-end-andro-1842394621,"After checking out the Galaxy S20 Ultra, it’s difficult to forget it’s brawny build, avalanche of specs, and the impressive reach of Samsung’s Space Zoom. Unfortunately, at $1,400, it’s also a bit too expensive to love. At that price, the S20 Ultra has to be head and shoulders better than every other phone on the market, and it just isn’t. But perhaps the best argument against the S20 Ultra is the existence of the S20+, because for 15 percent less money, the S20+ delivers 95 percent of what you get from its more expensive sibling. So if you’re looking for a high-end Android phone with tons of bells and whistles, the S20+ is the one to get.Starting with its build, the Galaxy S20+’s 6.7-inch screen isn’t that much smaller than the 6.9-inch panel on the S20 Ultra, so you’re not really missing out on much when it comes to your overall viewing experience. And because the S20+’s camera module isn’t a huge, boxy thing that sticks out like a ravenous overbite, it’s lighter, sleeker, and much more suited to one-handed operation too.As for its display, the S20+ still has support for a 120Hz refresh rate (but only at FHD+ resolution, mind you), which when combined with an excellent peak brightness of 729 nits and incredibly vivid colors, there’s absolutely no compromise in image quality. In fact, the only phone in recent history with a display that comes anywhere near matching the S20+’s screen is the Oppo Find X2, which isn’t officially available in the U.S. and costs around $1,350. Also, like the standard S20 and S20 Ultra, the S20+  features slightly less rounded sides, which reduces distortion around the edge of the screen while still providing an extremely comfortable and polished in-hand feel (and IP68 water-resistance).The S20+ doesn’t fall short on specs either, boasting the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip, 12GB of RAM, 128GB of base storage (or 512GB if you go for the optional upgrade), and microSD card slot you get on the S20 Ultra. The only thing you’re really missing is the built-in headphone jack found on last year’s Galaxy S10. Although since 3.5mm jacks are becoming an increasingly rare feature, it’s not like the S20 is really losing ground there either.I also want to call special attention to the 12GB of RAM in the S20+. Putting that much memory in a phone might seem as silly as Scrooge McDuck trying to swim through a pool of coins (which would be physically impossible btw), but after using the S20 Ultra and now the S20+, I’ve really grown to appreciate having access to that much RAM. That’s because by clicking on the icon of an app in Android’s recent apps list, you can select up to three different apps that the phone will always keep running in the background for instant multitasking, something that even works with more resource-intensive things like games and editing apps. So despite the incredibly powerful A-series chips Apple uses in iPhones and iPads, I’d argue the S20+’s mountain of RAM makes it faster in the real world, with tests like this helping support that hypothesis.Next we come to cameras, which is the really the only main point of difference between the S20+ and S20 Ultra. As someone who uses a phone’s zoom camera way more than its ultra-wide cam, I sometimes find myself longing for the 10x lossless zoom from the S20 Ultra. However, even with just a 3x lossless zoom (which doesn’t even use a true optical zoom to achieve that reach), the Galaxy S20+ compares quite favorably to the Pixel 4's 2x telephoto camera and Google Super Res Zoom, with the S20+ often producing the better looking zoom pic.In a shot of New York City at 3x, the S20+’s photo is slightly sharper, resulting in crisper text on various signs (see below), while the Pixel 4 XL using its 2x optical zoom lens and digital Super Res Zoom processing to get to that full 3x produced an image that looks just a tiny bit softer, darker, and fuzzier.And in more typical shots, while the S20+ doesn’t earn a clean sweep over the Pixel 4 or iPhone 11, thanks to its slightly cheaper price tag, the S20+’s few photo shortcomings—like sometimes making certain textures look a bit too smooth or too yellow—are much more forgivable. Like previous Galaxy phones, the S20+ tends to overemphasize yellows and sometimes struggles with white balance—especially at night—which is something you can see in head-to-head comparison of a shot I took of a tree sitting underneath a streetlight. That said, thanks to brighter, more vivid colors, the S20+ produced a more appealing pic of some nearby graffiti than both the iPhone 11 and Pixel 4.Meanwhile, when things are really dark and you need to use the S20+ dedicated Night Mode, the S20+ produced a surprisingly bright and relatively detailed image of a basketball court that almost looks like it shot at sunset instead of midnight, which was when I actually snapped the pic. That said, both the S20+ and iPhone 11's shot go heavy on the yellows and browns with the iPhone’s shot almost looking like Apple automatically applied some kind of sepia filter, both of which stand in contrast to the Pixel 4's much clearer Night Sight shot. Google still has the best night mode around.And just like the S20 Ultra, the S20+ has 8K video capture, Samsung’s new multi-photo Single Take feature, and even a time-of-flight sensor on back for more accurately measuring the size and distance of nearby objects. And when it comes to battery life, the S20+ fared the best out of all the S20s on our video rundown test, lasting nearly 16 hours (15:56 to be exact) on a single charge. That’s better than the S20 Ultra and the standard S20's time of 14:41 and 15:16 respectively. Though it’s important to note that if you do enable Samsung’s 120Hz mode, that tends to knock off three to four hours of runtime. Considering that S20+’s impressive longevity, that isn’t really an issue. Then, when it comes time to recharge, the S20+ supports 25-watt wired charging (which is the same as the S20 Ultra unless you spend extra to buy a separate 45-watt charger), along with 15-watt Qi wireless charging and 9-watt reverse wireless charging, with the latter remaining one of the most underappreciated features on phones.Also, while 5G support shouldn’t be your top deciding factor when it comes to buying a phone right now (carriers still have a lot of work to do to build out coverage), it’s important to note that that unlike the standard S20 (which currently only supports sub-6GHz 5G), the S20+ supports all three major 5G bands used in the U.S. So even if you don’t live in an area that has 5G coverage right now, the S20+ is already prepared for when you will, which makes it slightly more future proof than the vanilla S20.Look, I still wish the S20+ (and the S20 Ultra for that matter) was slightly cheaper, and for people who like a smaller phone, the standard S20's design and dimensions are sublime. In a more sensible world, the $1,200 S20+ would only cost $100 more than the standard S20 ($1,000), and the S20 Ultra would cost $1,200 instead of $1,400. Regardless, the S20+ is a superb device with the best value and blend of specs and features out of the S20 family. And among Android phones, the S20+ is the real high-end handset to beat. Just remember, if you’re thinking about getting one, try to find a deal or trade-in to make that sticker shock just a bit more tolerable."
33,Samsung S20 Ultra,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-review-glorious-excess-with-a-1841946457,"Let’s skip past all the hemming and hawing. Between its huge 6.9-inch 120Hz screen, beastly specs, 5G support, 108-MP main camera, Space Zoom lens, and 8K video capture, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is an absolute powerhouse. It has practically any feature you could ever want (aside from a headphone jack), and unless you’re a stylus die-hard, the  S20 Ultra makes the $1,100 Note 10+ seem like a quaint mid-range device. And if price wasn’t a factor, I’d have a hard time choosing any phone available today over the Galaxy S20 Ultra.But a world without price tags simply isn’t a place where normal people live. Ultimately, how you feel about the S20 Ultra is intrinsically linked to how willing you are to part with $1,400. For a lot of people, that’s a month’s rent or nice vacation, and a frighteningly steep jump up from the $1,000 flagship phones that were already making people’s wallets weep. So the only way to really get a feel for what this phone can do is to take a deep dive down to see if the S20 Ultra can really justify its price.Look, there’s no getting around it, at 6.57 by 2.99 by 0.35 inches and weighing 7.83 ounces the S20 Ultra is a damn big phone. But Samsung puts that room to good use, and in fact, the S20 Ultra is slightly narrower than the Note 10+ (6.39 by 3.04 by 0.31 inches, 6.91 ounces). What makes the S20 Ultra feel so bulky is its thickness and weight. Now I admit, a few hundredths of an inch and less than an ounce of added heft don’t sound like much, but those things do make a difference when you’re trying to reach across the phone to hit a letter while typing—especially if your hands are on the smaller side.At the same time, phones have continued to get larger every year since the original Galaxy Note broke past the 5-inch barrier in back in 2011, so I’d have to be somewhat shortsighted to declare that even at 6.9-inches, the S20 Ultra is officially “too big.” And when you consider the spectacular image quality the S20 Ultra’s screen offers, it’s damn near impossible to argue that bigger isn’t better, even if its size and weight sometimes makes the phone feel cumbersome.The rest of the S20 Ultra’s design is actually surprisingly utilitarian. The massive camera module around back calls attention to the S20 Ultra’s quad cam arrangement and provides a place for Samsung to install its periscope zoom, but it ain’t pretty. Samsung also slimmed down the S20 Ultra’s even further and reduced the curvature of its rounded glass, which should be a welcome change for all the people who’ve been hating on the sloped screens found on previous Galaxy phones.So while the Galaxy S20 Ultra is very practical, it doesn’t look as expensive as it costs, which is kind of a shame. Going back to the Galaxy S8, Samsung made one of the prettiest phones of all time, and while the S20 Ultra shares the same DNA, with just two rather drab colors to choose from (black or gray), Samsung’s glass and aluminum design has gone from being a slick, well-tailored suit to something closer to a pair of work overalls. A very slippery and shiny pair of overalls, but overalls nonetheless.When it comes to the S20 Ultra’s screen itself, after Samsung saw its best phones last year get one-upped by handsets with 90HZ displays like the OnePlus 7 Pro, Pixel 4, and others, this year, Samsung is flexing on the smartphone industry by introducing new 120Hz OLED screens on the S20 line. To me, Samsung’s jump up to a 120Hz refresh rate offers an even better sweet spot between the 60Hz panels found on regular phones and the overly-thirsty 300Hz or 360Hz displays we’re starting to see over in the PC world. It’s difficult to properly describe the increased smoothness and fluidity a high refresh rate display offers in words, but if you just take a couple seconds to toggle on the option in the phone, your eyes might almost cry with delight.The one downside is that 120Hz mode is only available when the phone is set to FHD+ resolution or lower instead of its max QHD+ 3200 x 1440 capacity. Samsung says it implemented this limit to help balance the phone’s power draw with its display performance, which makes sense, but I can’t help but wish there was an optimized mode like you get on the Pixel 4 that can dynamically switch the S20 Ultra’s refresh rate depending on content without lowering the phone’s resolution.But regardless of which resolution or refresh rate you use, the S20 Ultra’s 6.9-inch display is enchantingly pleasing. Its peak brightness of 707 nits is excellent, and especially in Vivid mode, everything pops with splashes of rich, punchy colors. For years, Samsung has demonstrated that it makes the best mobile displays in the world, and that’s definitely still true on the S20 Ultra.Moving on to sound, the S20 Ultra’s speakers use a familiar setup featuring a big speaker on the bottom of the phone and the earpiece above the display to deliver powerful stereo sound. The S20 Ultra has no trouble filling a medium-sized room with music, but audio quality doesn’t seem to have changed much from the Galaxy S10 or Note 10.There’s a weird notion that’s been floating around the net that somehow a phone that has more RAM than a typical laptop is stupid. But it’s not, it’s fantastic. Getting annoyed about a phone having too much RAM is like being upset that your Ferrari’s top speed is too high. The S20 Ultra is really expensive, and it ought to have specs to reflect that. And while it’s true that apps like Facebook and Twitter don’t exactly tax phones that much, there are a number of situations where having a ton of RAM is genuinely useful.With 12GB of RAM, you rarely have to reload apps, which means you can switch between tasks with the greatest of haste. And for anyone who plays more demanding mobile games like PUBG Mobile or Call of Duty Mobile, having all that RAM is a massive time saver that allows you to keep multiple memory-heavy games going in the background with essentially no impact on the phone’s overall performance.And when you combine that RAM with a Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 865 chip, 128GB of storage (or 512GB if you pay for the upgrade), a microSD slot, and support for all three flavors of 5G used in the U.S. (sub 6Ghz, 2.5Ghz, and mmWave), you get a blazing fast 5G-ready phone that works on any carrier. In fact, when it comes to 5G performance, you’re more limited by the networks than what the phone can do. While testing out mmWave 5G on Verizon, I saw speeds between 500 Mbps to well over 1.2 Mbps in New York City, though only outside and in limited areas like around Bryant Park and MSG, as Verizon’s 5G service is relatively spotty.When I swapped in a T-Mobile SIM to try out another 5G network, I got a very different experience due to T-Mo’s use of sub-6GHz 5G, with speeds ranging from 60 Mbps to over 100 Mbps. But unlike Verizon, I was able to get that relatively consistently throughout the city, and even inside our office on the 28th floor of our building. Is the S20 Ultra a bit excessive? Sure, But for $1,400 it damn well better be, and despite thoughts to the contrary, it is possible to use nearly all of the phones prodigious performance, especially if you’re one of the few people that takes advantage of Samsung’s DeX mode, which is still available on the new S20s.Packing a 108-MP main camera, a 48-MP telephoto camera, a 12-MP ultra-wide-angle camera and a 40-MP selfie cam (not to mention a bonus 3D time-of-flight cam), the Galaxy S20 Ultra might have the most pixel rich assortment of smartphone cameras ever.When shooting normally, the S20 Ultra uses it huge 108-MP sensor to create sharp detailed images, and a nine to one pixel binning technique so that even in low-light, you still get bright, colorful images without needing to switch over to night mode. This is one of the S20's biggest strengths, because quite often, you may not have the time or luxury to sit there and hold the phone still for three or four seconds like you have to when using night mode. In a comparison against a Pixel 4 XL in a darkened theatre, the S20 Ultra’s pic was noticeably sharper, captured way more fine details like on the brickwork in the background, and was less grainy to boot. (See the images below.) Samsung had been losing ground to Google and then Apple last year with the iPhone 11 Pro when it came to pure image quality. And while the S20 Ultra hasn’t leaped ahead of its competitors in every situation, at least the S20 Ultra can keep pace and earn a win depending on the scene.In another comparison against the iPhone 11, the S20 Ultra took a shot of some street art boasting the vivid, almost overly saturated colors Samsung phones tend to prefer, while also capturing slightly more detail of the texture on the wall. Then, in a different shot of a giant pile of matcha up against a Pixel 4, the S20 Ultra captured a nice bright pic with better exposure than what I got from the Pixel 4. However, I will say the Pixel 4 did a slightly better job with white balance and capturing the dark grassy green of the matcha powder compared to the slightly yellow tint you see in the S20 Ultra’s pic.I was also pleasantly surprised by how much better the S20 Ultra’s Night Mode is, as it turned a rather dark shot in Central Park into a serene low-light landscape. Compared to both the iPhone 11 and Pixel 4, Samsung largely matched its competitors in terms of sharpness and detail, though the S20 Ultra’s pic does succumb to Samsung’s tendency to go heavy on yellow, especially in when it’s dark out.However, the S20 Ultra’s camera isn’t without its struggles. Sometimes, it’s autofocus takes longer to lock on than you’d expect, and in one Night Mode shot, the S20 Ultra produced a pic that went way overboard on the yellow tones for no real good reason that I can see. To its credit, Samsung says it will continue to improve and adjust the S20 Ultra’s camera, so hopefully things get better before the phone officially launches in a week on March 6th. Stay tuned for updates.When it comes to busting out the S20 Ultra’s 48-MP Spaaaaaace Zoom, there’s a lot of fun to be had and even a bit of silliness. To reach its claimed 100x zoom potential, Samsung combines a 4x optical zoom with some fancy processing to create a 10x “lossless” zoom, and from 1x to 10x, the results speak for themselves. Images are sharp and detailed even when the phone is handheld, and way better than you get from an iPhone 11 Pro or a Pixel 4, which are both limited to paltry 2x optical zooms.However, when going from 10x to its full 100x zoom, Samsung is simply using digital zoom to crop in and make things look larger without actually enhancing image quality in a meaningful way. So as you go above 10x, clarity and sharpness start to deteriorate. I would say zooming to 25x or 30x is still usable if you don’t mind some fuzziness, but the further you go above 30x, the more your photo starts to look like an impressionist painting. And at 100x you might as well call yourself Claude Monet. For anything above 20x or so, you’re also going to need a tripod, or else you’ll spend so much time trying to hold the camera steady, you might miss your shot completely. And even if you do have a tripod, touching the phone to press the shutter button introduces even more blur into the photo, so it’s best to set a timer instead.As for the S20 Ultra’s numerous other camera features like Single Shot mode, improved Super Steady Video, and Live Focus photos and videos, while many of them may feel somewhat niche or gimmicky on their own, when you combine everything together, you get the most robust smartphone photo and video toolkit on any handset available right now. And then there’s 8K video recording mode, which is a nice option to have, but since no one really owns 8K displays or watches native 8K content, 8K video is better used as a supplement to 4K content, allowing you to crop in for a tight shot when needed.And while I’m typically not someone who takes a lot of selfies, I’ve got to give credit to the S20 Ultra’s 40-MP front-facing cam. On previous Galaxy S phones, selfies often made people’s face look a little soft, their skin a little too smooth, as if the phone’s beautification slider was never fully turned off. But on the Galaxy S20 Ultra, things look super crisp, and you’re going to see everyone’s flaws and blemishes in full detail, to the point where you might go back to turning beauty mode on ever so slightly.With a massive screen and 5G connectivity to consider, it’s a damn good thing the S20 Ultra comes with a giant 5,000 mAh battery. On our video rundown test, the S20 Ultra boasts strong battery life, lasting 14 hours and 41 minutes on a single charge, which is just barely down from the 15:09 we got saw on the S10+ last year. That gives you confidence that as 5G becomes more widely available and starts sucking up extra juice, the S20 Ultra will still have more than enough juice to last a full day and then some.One important thing to note though is that if you do opt to turn on the S20 Ultra’s 120Hz mode (and you really should), I found that decreases the S20 Ultra’s battery life by an hour or two depending on usage. If you’re sitting there scrolling through Instagram feeds or similar things for multiple hours straight, you may suck up a little more juice than normal. But even with 120Hz mode on, I never ended a day with less than 15 or 20 percent battery, even with the phone getting heavy use from 7AM to midnight.On the charging side, the S20 Ultra is the first phone to support certified USB Fast Charging which is nice to see as various groups attempt to consolidate the wide array of fast charging techniques. The phone comes with a 25-watt charger in the box, which was able to take the phone from 5 percent charge to 31 percent charge in just 15 minutes, which should be enough to last nearly another half a day. And if you really want, the S20 Ultra does support up to 45-watt fast charging, though it’s not really a must-have, as it’s only marginally faster than regular using the included 25-watt power adapter.And like we got on last year’s Galaxy, the S20 supports Qi wireless charging at up to 15-watts, and reverse wireless charging at up to 9-watts, which are both faster than you get from most phones with this capability. (Other phones with reverse wireless charging tend to cap out at just 5-watts.)On top of everything, the S20 Ultra comes with some other improvements like Samsung’s Quick Share tool for more easily sending and receiving files wireless with other Galaxy phones. Unfortunately, because this feature is only available on the S20 line for now, and I don’t have another S20 with Quick Share or Samsung’s new Bluetooth Music Share to really test those features in-depth just yet.Seriously, there’s very little to dislike about the S20 Ultra. It has blazing performance, the best screen on a phone I’ve seen yet, strong battery life, and thanks to full support for the three main types of 5G, it’s as future proof as you can get at the moment (though admittedly with where 5G is at right now, that only goes so far).There are definitely things that might not sit well for some, like the phone’s massive screen, thick, heavy body, and somewhat plain styling, but how you feel about those will vary from person to person. The S20 Ultra is Samsung doing what Samsung does best, putting class-leading hardware on devices before anyone else. And if Samsung can address some of the quirks with its camera, the S20 Ultra will fully prove it deserves to hang around with other top-tier smartphone cams.In the end, the only major sticking point about the S20 Ultra is its price. After seeing Samsung list it at $1,400, I feared that Samsung may have priced the S20 Ultra (along with the rest of the S20 family) into a corner after even after spending a lot of time with that phone, the fear remains. The S20 Ultra is overpowered, it’s a phone of glorious excess, but if you don’t want to drop $1,400 on an S20 Ultra (or any other super-premium phone), that’s an eminently logical response. The S20 Ultra is really expensive, and even if you crave one, don’t feel bad about buying something else. "
34,Samsung Z Flip,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-a-foldable-worth-caring-a-1841823463,"With all the hazards and issues found on previous foldable phones, it’d be hard to blame anyone for writing off flexible screen tech completely. But that sentiment might be a bit premature, because with the Galaxy Z Flip, Samsung has made the first foldable phone  worth caring about.Honestly, the biggest compliment I can give the Z Flip is that it feels a lot like a traditional smartphone, but with the ability to bend the screen in half and end calls by slamming the phone shut, which is really goddamn satisfying. Now I admit the part about functioning as a normal phone might not sound like much, especially for something that costs $1,400, but it really is a massive improvement, enough for me to say that the Z Flip feels like a more refined, second-gen take on foldable tech.That’s because with previous bendy phones like the Galaxy Fold, Huawei Mate X, and the new Moto Razr, it seemed like you had to give them a white glove treatment while standing inside a hermetically sealed room just to prevent particles from getting inside or the screen from falling apart. But with the Z Flip, there’s a sort of understated confidence. When closed, it’s a compact package that lets you stash it practically anywhere (even in tiny clutches and many of the impractically small pockets they put on women’s pants), while also being quite comfortable to hold.And when it’s open, the Z Flip expands to reveal a 6.7-inch 2636 x 1080 FHD+ screen with a 10-MP punch-hole selfie cam (which Samsung claims is a first for a phone with a bendy screen). Considering the phone is essentially a 3.5-inch by 2.9-inch rectangle when folded, it’s pretty impressive how much screen real estate you can get out of such a small package. For comparison’s sake, the Galaxy S20 Ultra—which has a massive 6.9-inch display—is basically the same size as the Z Flip with its screen fully deployed—but you can’t fold the S20 Ultra in half for better portability. Around the edge of the phone, there’s a plastic bezel that helps protect the Z Flip from damaging its display when you slam it shut, while also ensuring that if any small particles do get caught inside, they won’t grind on the Z Flip’s display. And on the right side, there’s a speedy fingerprint sensor built into the phone’s lock button and a volume rocker, which both work well. I just wish they were positioned a bit lower on the phone for easier use while the phone is unfolded.As for the Galaxy Z Flip’s ultra-thin glass screen, it’s sort of like two steps forward, but one step back. That’s because while it feels a lot like a traditional glass screen, as we’ve seen in teardown videos, for some reason Samsung also put a plastic film on top of the glass, which is what your fingers are actually touching. Sadly, this means the even though the entire display feels stronger and more substantial, it’s still prone to dings from things like keys, pens, or even your fingernails if you press hard enough. And while the crease from the Galaxy Fold has returned, it’s not quite as obvious when the screen is on, particularly when seen from normal viewing angles. But it’s there and you can feel it too, though I find it’s not really an issue as I don’t really touch the middle of the screen that much, even when scrolling through things like Twitter feeds, websites, and more. Also, it’s important to go into the Z Flip’s settings and turn Finger Sensor gestures on, which allows you to open the notification shade by swiping down on the fingerprint reader. Otherwise, the Z Flip’s extra tall 21:9 aspect ratio can make it difficult to reach the top of the screen with one hand.Meanwhile, on the outside, the Z Flip sports a tiny 1.1-inch cover screen which you can use to check notifications, view calendar alerts, or change music. Alternatively, you can use the Z Flip’s cover screen as the world’s smallest viewfinder when taking selfies, but the screen is so small, sometimes it’s a challenge to even fit your entire head in the display. I’m sort of conflicted. I feel like I would have liked a larger display, but at the same time, in a world where apps and social media are constantly begging for your attention, seeing fewer notifications isn’t necessarily a bad thing. And on top of that, forcing people to use the Z Flip’s main display to do anything meaningful simply means you get to open and close the phone more often, which is always a treat.Most of those issues aren’t really a big deal, as the Z Flip’s design protects the display when closed, but you’re going to want to refrain from letting people or pets dig their claws in there. The Z Flip also isn’t really water-resistant, because while Samsung did coat the phone’s internals with a hydrophobic coating, that’s more to protect against mist or moisture than a full dunk in the sink. Samsung also put tiny brushes inside the Z Flip’s beefy hinge, to prevent dirt and dust from getting inside, but only time will tell how well that’ll work. So in the end, while the Z Flip is definitely more durable than previous foldable phones—particularly its body, screen, and hinge—it’s not quite a chuckable as a traditional glass sandwich handset (which aren’t very chuckable to begin with).Thankfully, the Z Flip’s specs are solid (and way better than the mid-range components you get on the Moto Razr), because while you don’t get a headphone jack or a microSD card slot (both becoming harder and harder to find on flagship phones anyway), you do get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ chip, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage to make up for the Flip’s lack of expandability.Battery life is also surprisingly decent, as the Z Flip lasted 13 hours and 29 minutes on our video rundown test, which is an hour longer than what we got from the Pixel 4 XL (12:36), about the same as the OnePlus 7 Pro (13:36), but still short of the Galaxy S10+ (15:09). You also get both wireless and reverse wireless charging, though the latter is slightly less useful than on other phones considering the Z Flip only has a 3,300 mAh battery. The one curiosity to me though is that the Z Flip only uses its earpiece for calls unlike practically every other recent Galaxy phone. That means you only get mono sound from the Flip’s bottom-mounted speaker.When it comes to snapping pics, the Z Flip’s rear 12-MP main cam and 12-MP ultra-wide camera are practically the same as what you get on a Galaxy S10, but with slightly better image processing. Pics generally look good, but you’re not getting the new and improved cams with bigger sensors Samsung installed on the new Galaxy S20 line. And as with previous Galaxy phones, the Z Flip tends to capture pics with an overly yellow color cast compared to other phones. Phones such as the Pixel 4 offer better white balance. Also, while not having a telephoto cam isn’t a deal-breaker, it’s still kind of a bummer that the Z Flip didn’t get one.However, despite shortcomings like the lack of real water resistance and a screen that’s sturdy but still not as durable as real glass, the Z Flip is a triumph. It’s impressive to see how much things have improved since the Galaxy Fold. By eliminating the panel gaps and squishy screen on the Fold, Samsung has transformed the Z Flip into something you’re not scared to carry around. Its smaller dimensions are a delight to hold, and nifty tricks like being able to open the phone 90 degrees to turn the phone into its own little tripod while taking pics are more useful than you might imagine.That makes the Z Flip’s biggest hurdle its price (and availability). But as the original Razr proved more than 15 years ago, there’s plenty of room in the world for a more lifestyle-focused phone with above-average specs. And compared to the new Razr, the Z Flip has it beat in nearly every single way. Cost, specs, battery life, cameras, and durability. The Z Flip is here to correct the mistakes of previous foldables, to the point that you might even consider buying one. Which is exactly what I did.Now I’m not saying anyone should spend $1,400 on a phone. I bought one because I was morbidly curious and wanted to test how the Z Flip and Samsung’s ultra-thin glass holds up over time. But after having one for just shy of a week, the big takeaway is that the Z Flip proves foldable phones are much more than a fad."
35,LG G8X,https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g8x-dual-screen-phone-gives-you-the-most-screen-for-1839459490,"Back in 2011, the original Samsung Galaxy Note confirmed people had an insatiable appetite for big screens. And just in the last couple years, we’ve gotten phones with extra long screens, transforming screens, flexible screens, and even wraparound screens. But now with the G8X Dual Screen, LG is hoping to top them all by giving us more display (or should I say displays) for way less money. Ok, so what are we looking at here? On its own, the LG G8X is a pretty standard Android phone with specs that fall between what you get on a Pixel 4 XL and a Samsung Galaxy S10+. We’re talking a Snapdragon 855 chip with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, 4,000 mAh battery, microSD card expandability, and a 2,340 by 1,080 6.4-inch OLED screen. It’s a pretty respectable package, and when you throw in some nice bonuses like a headphone jack, in-display fingerprint sensor, an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, and Qi wireless charging, the G8X easily qualifies itself as a solid high-end (though not exactly flagship-level) smartphone.But where things get really interesting is that bundled along with the phone is LG’s Dual Screen accessory, which adds an identical 6.4-inch OLED screen that’s attached to a nifty folding cover. Technically, LG’s Dual Screen accessory adds two screens, because in addition to that big interior screen, there’s a tiny cover screen on the outside that lets you quickly check the time or recent notifications. And the total asking price for both the phone and the Dual Screen accessory? Just $700.Forget talk of aggressive pricing, that’s practically theft in today’s market. Two 6.4-inch displays gives you more screen real estate than what you get from the $2,000 Galaxy Fold (since you can’t use the Fold’s interior and exterior screens at the same time), but for way less than half the price. If there was a stat like WAR in baseball for phones called screens above replacement, then the LG G8X Dual Screen is basically Mike Trout.Now I admit, there’s a lot of people out there that don’t want or need that much screen, and that’s fine. But for power users, gamers, or anyone who really likes to multitask, the LG G8X is almost downright delightful. Business types can use both screens at the same time to check their calendar while writing an email. Meanwhile, social media mavens can watch a show and live tweet all on the same device—no extra gadgets needed. (Or have apps like Twitter and Instagram open at the same time, if need be.) But personally, my favorite use of the LG’s dual screens is to help wind down before going to sleep by watching sports or YouTube and banging out daily quests in one of the too many mobile games I play.And to support all the various ways of using the G8X Dual Screen, LG has equipped the phone with gesture controls (three-finger swipe) and a simple floating button for switching apps between screens, with additional shortcuts for turning the second screen off, or dimming the main screen. Also, because the Dual Screen accessory has a relatively stiff hinge, you can set the phone up like a 2-in-1, complete with tent and presentation modes.LG didn’t stop there though, because, for serious mobile gamers, the Dual Screen can also serve as a configurable controller. By default, LG has provided a basic layout that works for most RPGs and action games, and in this mode, the Dual Screen communicates with the phone over Bluetooth, so a lot of games will detect the Dual Screen as a native gamepad. However, if you want to get creative, you also have the ability to create custom layouts with individually mapped functions, which is great for shooters or other titles that often rely on onscreen virtual controls.Combined, if you factor in the Dual Screen’s programmable gamepad support and general use, LG says that practically every app on the Play Store works on the G8X’s second screen in some fashion. That said, not everything works as expected. For example, you can’t watch YouTube and YouTube TV at the same time, because the second you press play on one app, the other pauses itself. Additionally, even if you do find two video players that can play simultaneously (like YouTube and Vimeo), you can’t select which audio you want to listen to, it’s both or nothing.Unfortunately, a lot of these issues are out of LG’s control, as Android itself has limits on how many apps can be in focus at the same time. And if you wanted to try to outsmart Android by plugging in headphones for one app, while listening to another using the G8X’s stereo speakers, that won’t work either. And for people who might have multiple Instagram or Twitter accounts, there isn’t a great way to have multiple versions of the same app running on each screen too, which is a bit of a bummer. Right now, Android isn’t fully prepared for tech like this.When it comes to the rest of the phone, the G8X features a high-res 32-MP selfie camera in front, along with two cams in back: a 12-MP main cam, and a 13-MP ultra-wide cam with a 136-degree field of view that offers some of the widest shots you can get from any phone. And with helpful modes like 4K time-lapse, automatic scene tuning, and a built-in steady cam feature, the G8X has a lot of photo-related tricks up its sleeves.Although the G8X lacks a dedicated telephoto cam and doesn’t have the overall photo prowess of some of its competitors. It can’t quite keep up with some of the smartphone cameras on the market. In almost every picture from head-to-head shoutout against the Pixel 4, the G8X’s pics weren’t quite as rich, detailed, or sharp as what I got from Google’s phone. It’s close, but G8X was always just slightly behind.The G8X Dual Screen can also be awkward at times. With a 6.4-inch screen, the G8X is already pretty big, but when you add a second display and a plastic frame to hold everything together, the G8X can turn into a real handful. The G8X also suffers from sub-optimal button layout, because when the phone is fully open, the Dual Screen’s hinge makes it difficult to use the phone’s volume rocker.But what’s even more annoying is that because the Dual Screen connects to the G8X via its USB-C port, you need to use a special adapter to recharge the phone, unless you want to detach the phone from the second screen or use a wireless charging pad every time. The dongle attaches to the end of a normal USB-C cable and acts much like the MagSafe connector on old MacBooks (remember those?), but for frequent travelers or people who prefer wired charging, it can get kind of tiring trying to keep track of where you left that tiny adapter.Also, despite Android 10 being released in early September, almost three months later, the G8X is launching with the older Android 9 Pie. Worse, right now, LG doesn’t have a timeline for when Android 10 might be available. With LG’s history of slow OS updates, I wouldn’t bank of getting anything soon.To make all this possible, LG cut a couple of corners as well. When I said earlier that the G8X’s second screen is identical to the first, I wasn’t kidding, because if you’ll notice, the second screen has a notch despite not actually having a camera behind that notch. For LG, it was simply easier and more cost-effective to source two of the exact same panel, instead of making a second 6.4-inch screen without a notch.And for some reason, the G8X doesn’t support face unlock of any kind, which seems like a major omission. Ideally, you’d want the phone to unlock automatically when you open it up. However, because there’s no face unlock, you have to use the in-display fingerprint reader (or rely on smart unlock), which means using the phone doesn’t feel as smooth as it could be.Thankfully, for those of you worried about the G8X’s battery life (especially when connected to a second screen), things are actually pretty good. On our standard video rundown test, the G8X on its own lasted 14 hours and 17 minutes. When combined, even though the Dual Screen doesn’t have its own battery, LG says running both displays at once only sucks up an extra 20 to 25 percent of the phone’s juice. This may have been a bit too optimistic on LG’s part, but not entirely outlandish, because after enabling the second screen and repeating our rundown test with two videos playing, the G8X Dual Screen managed to last 8 hours and 23 minutes, which ain’t bad at all.While I wish LG gave the G8X a more up to date version of Android and that I didn’t need to worry about special power adapters, I just can’t ignore how much value this phone offers. In some, ways, you might even think of the G8X’s Dual Screen accessory as the ultimate phone case. Not only does it protect the phone, it adds a ton of utility. The LG G8X isn’t for everyone, but if you simply want the most screen for your money, the G8X Dual Screen deserves a serious look (or two)."
36,Pixel 4,https://gizmodo.com/the-pixel-4-wins-by-being-more-human-1839213111,"Some phones look to impress with an abundance of tech, while others promise simplicity and a tightly knit ecosystem. But when it comes to Pixel phones, Google leans on its expertise in software. Last year, it felt like things finally came together on the Pixel 3 thanks to features like Night Sight, Call Screen, Now Playing song identification, and more. But for the new Pixel 4, Google has put a twist on its typical software-first approach by creating a smartphone that responds to you less like a computer and more like a human. Google’s drive to make interacting with gadgets feel more natural and intuitive is something you can see across its entire portfolio of gadgets, from smart speakers that support conversational speech recognition to a map app that can warn you about traffic jams before you even get in your car. But on the Pixel 4, Google has taken that directive to a whole new level.The best example of this is the Pixel 4's Motion sense, which uses tiny radar chips (called Soli) embedded into the phone’s top bezel to detect nearby objects. At its most basic level, the Pixel 4 uses Soli to detect if anyone is nearby (up to 0.6 meters away), so it can do things like disable the phone’s always-on display to help save battery life when no one’s around. This might sound like a very simplistic use case, but that’s mostly because it mimics natural human behavior. After all, if you were talking to someone and they walked out of the room in the middle of a conversation, you wouldn’t keep babbling away unless you had some way of knowing they were still paying attention, would you?Then moving one level up is the Pixel 4's ability to sense a nearby hand. It uses this to wake up the phone’s 3D dot projector, so that the Pixel 4 can recognize your face and unlock the phone just a bit faster. It also uses this ability to reduce the phone’s ringer volume after you reach to answer a call. The phone has gotten your attention, so there’s no need to continue making a scene. Only an asshole would keep yelling in your face after they’ve made their point.Finally, there’s Soli’s gesture recognition, which currently is limited to detecting broad swipes of your hand above or in front of the phone, allowing you to skip songs, silence calls, or snooze alarms. But even with this small number of supported actions, it drastically changes the way you use the device. Listening to music and suddenly Lil Pump comes on? Just slap the air above the Pixel 4 and delight as “Esskeeit” gets nexted into oblivion where it belongs.It’s like the Pixel 4 understands the kneejerk response that is “Nah” like a good friend managing your playlist. And if you have the phone sitting in a charging stand or mounted to the dash on your car, things work even better, allowing you to dismiss annoying alarms or songs without ever really having to think about it. That said, while Google’s Motion Sense accuracy isn’t perfect, in my experience, the Pixel 4's hand tracking and swipe detection worked 9 out of 10 times. It makes similar gesture recognition systems like LG’s Air Motions seem like they’re playing JV ball.The Pixel 4's sense of humanity even extends to features like Live Captions (which can be toggled on and off from an icon in the phone’s volume controls) and the Recorder app’s Live Transcribe feature, which are incredible examples of natural language recognition. It doesn’t matter if you’re listening to a podcast, watching a documentary on Netflix, or recording an interview, the Pixel 4 can understand spoken word almost as well as a regular person. For someone who’s been trained to carry a dedicated audio recorder for recording interviews, the Pixel 4's Recorder app is a revelation.Though when you do need some outside help, the new version of the Google Assistant is ready and waiting. Thanks to improved contextual language recognition, after asking about today’s weather, you can simply follow that up by asking, “How about the rest of the week?” to get a longer forecast, instead of having to rephrase the entire question. The Google Assistant is also better at retrieving things like concert dates or finding the right pic from your recent photos. And in case your hands are busy elsewhere, you can even ask the Google Assistant to open specific apps or toggle settings like Bluetooth on or off. (Note: This is something everyone’s least favorite digital assistant Bixby has been able to do for years.)In some ways, even the Pixel 4's design feels more human. For a device that’s made out of metal and glass, it doesn’t feel like that at all. The Pixel 4's glass back features a lovely soft-touch finish that resists fingerprints and the coldness of normal glass. The phone feels more like leather—or dare I say—human skin. Meanwhile, the matte finish on the band around the outside of the phone feels closer to unglazed ceramic than metal, which gives the phone a somewhat earthy, organic texture.Also, regardless of which Pixel 4 you choose—either the standard 5.7-inch model or the 6.3 Pixel 4 XL—you get a lovely 90Hz screen that makes pretty much everything look smoother. By default, the Pixel 4's 90Hz refresh rate doesn’t apply to every single app (though you can force 90Hz all the time via a hidden developer setting). Most videos still top out at 60 FPS, which means you wouldn’t see a benefit either way. But thanks to its 90Hz screen, even little things like swiping up to open the app drawer feels snappier. It also adds newfound joy to timewasters like Candy Crush or more intense games like Dota Underlords.And then there’s the Pixel 4's camera. Not only is there a handy new drop-down that makes tweaking settings like flash, timers, and video modes easier to access, Google has also incorporated Google Lens right into the Pixel 4's viewfinder, so there’s no need to flip between apps. If you see something and want to know more, just press and hold on the object and the phone will dig up everything it can, or read the text on something so you can copy and paste it that info somewhere else.That last part feels like a dream because for so long, the frustration of a computer not recognizing text made by another computer simply because that info came from a camera instead of a digital file didn’t really make sense. You know what it says, the computer that printed displayed or printed out the text knows what it says, but because the format was wrong, that thing suddenly gets lost in translation. And this is all before we talk about the Pixel’s new 16-MP 2x telephoto camera (alongside its 12-MP main cam), new camera modes, and improved image quality. Starting with standard HDR+ shots, the Pixel 4 continues to impress, pumping out photos with excellent details, rich colors, and wide dynamic range compared to both the iPhone 11 and Galaxy Note 10. But for me, the bright spot is Google’s new dual exposure controls, which allow you to independently adjust the brightness of the foreground and background in your pics. For years, I’ve been hoping Google would add manual photo controls to the Pixel’s camera. However, after talking to Marc Levoy earlier this year—the head of Google’s computational photography team—I learned that because of the way Google’s HDR+ stacks multiple images on top of each other, simply adding dials for traditional settings like shutter speed and ISO doesn’t really make sense. That makes dual exposure controls the next best thing, allowing Pixel 4 owners to take advantage of HDR+, while also giving you the freedom and control to tweak images as you see fit. As for the Pixel 4's new 2x optical zoom lens, I pitted it against the reigning kind of smartphone zoom in the Huawei P30 Pro to see how optical zoom plus Google’s Super Res Zoom really holds up. On its own, it’s really impressive what Google can do, using digital enhancement in tandem with a dedicated zoom lens to shoot images with a 5x zoom. However, when compared side-by-side against the P30 Pro’s true 5x optical zoom, it’s clear that really good optics still can’t be beaten.My one major disappointment with the Pixel 4 is that in the five days I’ve had the phone, I haven’t been able to test its new astrophotography mode. In theory, enabling Night Sight and then pointing the phone at the night sky should automatically trigger the phone’s astrophotography mode. However, because it’s been cloudy and I deal with a lot of light pollution from a big city, I get nothing. That means, depending on where you are, you may need to go out of your way to take advantage of this feature. However, as great as all of the Pixel 4's new software and second camera are, I really wish Google paid more attention to the rest of the phone’s hardware. There’s no getting around this, Pixel 4's lack of an ultra-wide-angle camera feels like a major oversight. Not only does it put the Pixel 4 a step behind its biggest competitors in the iPhone 11 and Galaxy S10, but also on unequal footing compared to flagship phones from LG, OnePlus, Huawei, Motorola and more, which all released phones with triple rear camera modules in 2019. There’s really no excuse.The Pixel 4 also suffers from mediocre battery life, particularly the standard Pixel 4 and its 2,800 mAh battery. With a time of 10 hours and 38 minutes on our video rundown test, the standard Pixel 4's battery life is two hours shorter than the average battery life of every phone I’ve tested in 2019. That 10:38 number is closer to mid-range phones like the Moto G7 than it is to similarly priced competitors like the Galaxy S10 (14:45) or the OnePlus 7 Pro (13:36). Thankfully, the Pixel 4 XL fares slightly better with a time of 12:36, though that’s still not really a number worth bragging about. Now I must add that for a typical user, both phones are certainly capable of lasting throughout a full day’s use. But this also means that anyone who even remotely labels themselves a power user or is someone that gets anxious about running out of juice, the Pixel 4 XL is your only choice. Sorry small phone fans.In fact, the Pixel 4's general specs don’t fare well against its competitors. That’s because while the Pixel 4 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor like almost every ether Android flagship in 2019, it only gets 6GB of RAM (2GB less than a base Galaxy S10) and a base 64GB of storage (compared to GS10's 128GB of base storage). Furthermore, storage can only be upgraded to a total of 128GB, while companies like Samsung, Apple, and others offer configs with 512GB or more, which feels even worse when you remember the Pixel 4 doesn’t support microSD expandability.While some might say this specs race isn’t all that important, it actually affects other areas of the phone, like the Pixel’s video recording. Unlike pretty much every other high-end phone, the Pixel 4 can only record 4K video at 30 FPS, not 60 FPS, which Google claims is to help prevent videos from taking up too much space on the phone. But if there was more storage to go around, support for 4K 60 FPS video wouldn’t be a problem in the first place. Still, despite all of its shortcomings, the Pixel 4 is an amazing and sometimes even a jaw-dropping phone. Between features like Live Transcribe and Google Lens integration,  the Pixel 4 is smarter, more thoughtful, and more human than any other phone on the market. And if you’re not someone who typically gets bogged down with specs, I’d argue the Pixel 4 is the best pocket computer—or should I say pocket companion—to buy right now."
37,Sony Xperia 1,https://gizmodo.com/the-sony-xperia-1-is-the-most-underappreciated-phone-of-1838780003,"It feels like 2019 has been all about moving towards phones with fancy features like bezel-free screens, foldable displays, or nifty in-display fingerprint readers. But the Xperia 1 has none of these things. With its sizable forehead, extra tall 21:9 display, and a row of buttons and sensors running down its right side, the Xperia 1 looks lanky, maybe even a bit ungainly, like a teenager that just hit a growth spurt. Because of its slightly awkward appearance (and limited sales partners in the U.S.), a lot of people will never give this phone a chance. It’s a shame because the Xperia 1 might be the most underappreciated phone of 2019. Look, it’s no secret that Sony’s phone sales have struggled over the last few years, with Sony Mobile having lost more money than the entire Playstation division made as recently as Q2 2018. And while Sony’s Mobile has managed to slow the bleeding over the last few months, the only way to really dig itself out of the hole was to make some major changes. So after getting new leadership, Sony revamped its entire design process, and instead of doing everything in-house, Sony Mobile looked to some of Sony’s other hardware divisions like the company’s TV and mirrorless camera businesses to help give the Xperia 1 (and its mid-range sibling, the Xperia 10) a boost. And it worked, kind of.Using tech from its TV division, Sony created the world’s first 4K HDR OLED smartphone display, and it looks gorgeous, particularly if you’re the kind of person that watches a lot Netflix or other high-quality streaming video on the go. With its 21:9 display, you can watch blockbuster movies in their full native aspect ratio, instead of getting a cropped view or letterboxing at the top and bottom of the screen. On the other hand, if you watch a lot of YouTube or other services that largely feature 16:9 or 18:9 content, you’ll often have to deal with vertical black bars on either side framing your videos, so there’s definitely a trade-off.Meanwhile, to make its extra-tall display a bit more manageable, Sony created something called Side Sense, which features hidden touch sensors built into the frame surrounding the Xperia 1's display. So instead of trying to stretch your fingers to the top of the screen to open the notification tray, you can simply double-tap the side of the phone (on either side) to open up a list of your more commonly used apps and shortcuts for things like notifications, battery mode, multi-window mode, and more. That said, there is a learning curve when it comes to getting accustomed to Side Sense, and even now, I don’t always trigger the Side Sense menu on the first go.From Sony’s camera division, the Xperia 1 borrowed the Eye AF tracking system from the company’s high-end mirrorless cameras, which allows the phone to automatically detect and lock in on a person’s eye so that you never have to worry about your subject looking blurry or out of focus. This is something you can’t get on any other phone, and for people who love taking portrait shots, I’d argue Eye AF is way more important than any of the simulated bokeh or shallow depth of field effects that people seem to love so much. You also get your choice of three rear cameras consisting of a 12-MP main cam, a 12-MP 2x telephoto camera, and a 12-MP ultra-wide cam, and Sony’s signature dedicated shutter button (which is a personal favorite of mine). And for mobile video fanatics, Sony has created its Cinema Pro video recording app, which leans on expertise from Sony’s line of Cine Alta pro-grade video cams, giving you manual control over almost any setting you could ever want. From there you can easily adjust things like white balance, focus, frame rate (23.96 or 29.97 fps), and more, while also giving yourself readouts on things like audio levels and free storage space. And while I wouldn’t quite call this app a full pro-grade replacement for a “real” camera (we’re still talking about a phone), the Cinema Pro app is a great option for people hoping to shoot high-quality videos on a super pocketable device.And I can’t forget to mention to Dynamic Vibration system on the Xperia 1 (which was first introduced on the Xperia XZ2), which analyzes audio from games, music, and movies in real-time to give the phone a very noticeable rumble. It’s not a game-changer, but it’s a ton of fun and I often find myself missing it on other devices.However, despite all this innovation, the Xperia 1 still has a number of issues. On top of having a smallish 3,300 mAh battery, having to push pixels to a 4K display means the Xperia 1's battery life is average at best. On our video rundown test, the Xperia 1 lasted 10 hours and 33 minutes, which is significantly shorter than most (if not all) of its biggest competitors including the Galaxy S10+ (15:09), OnePlus 7 Pro (13:36), and others. The Xperia 1 also doesn’t have wireless charging or a headphone jack, both of which seem like major omissions on a phone that launched at $950 (though you can find it for around $850 or less now). The lack of a headphone jack feels particularly egregious, as Sony could have used that port to let people monitor audio or plug in a mic for even better video capture. I’m also not a huge fan of the Xperia 1's side-mounted fingerprint sensor. Generally it fine, but in my experience, it’s just not quite as accurate as a normal rear-mounted sensor or even the new in-display sensors found on many of the Xperia 1's rivals.But perhaps the most disappointing thing about the Xperia 1 is that for a phone with this much camera pedigree, its image quality seems like it should be better. In head-to-head comparisons against the Galaxy S10, Note 10, and Pixel 3, the Xperia 1's photos often lacked a tiny bit of detail or color saturation I saw in pics from those other phones.Part of the issue is that Sony still caters to what pro photographers typically want, often hedging on pictures by slightly underexposing the image (in order to preserve highlights) or using a flatter color profile (to avoid oversaturation), assuming that people will edit the Xperia 1's photos and fix these things before sharing. But that’s not really how people treat smartphone photos nowadays, and while an Instagram filter covers a lot of this stuff up, and with some tweaking you can produce some great looking pics, it feels that like with the Xperia 1, you have to work harder to get them.All this shoehorns the Xperia 1 into a pretty tight niche. You have to be a big mobile movie buff or an aspiring camera enthusiast who doesn’t mind putting in extra effort when capturing pics or videos to really get the best results. But still, the idea of sourcing the best features and components from some of Sony’s other divisions makes a ton of sense. That said, I find myself wishing we got more contributions from the PlayStation team. The Xperia 1 is certainly unique and definitely underrated, but it’s not the mass market handset that Sony Mobile’s bottom line wishes it was. Yet as a new approach to its smartphone business, the Xperia 1 holds a lot of promise for future devices too."
38,Oneplus 7t,https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-7t-review-a-refreshing-reset-of-expectations-1838479053,"From its humble start making “flagship killers” in 2014, OnePlus has become one of the fastest-growing smartphone makers, ranking in the top five globally and overtaking brands like Sony, HTC, and even LG—the same companies OnePlus once sought to take down. However, as OnePlus has grown, so too has the price of its phones, from $300 for the original OnePlus One to almost $700 for the OnePlus 7 Pro. With the new OnePlus 7T, OnePlus is using its latest handset as a chance to reset expectations when it comes to how we judge good performance and value.Starting at $600 (and on sale October 18th), the OnePlus 7T is actually $70 cheaper than the OnePlus 7 Pro we got earlier this spring. Despite its more affordable price tag, the OP7T still has the most important feature from its predecessor: a screen with a wonderfully smooth 90Hz refresh rate. After using phones like the Razer Phone 2, Asus ROG Phone, and both the OP7 Pro and OP7T, while the overall effect can be subtle, having a higher than normal refresh rate really does add a sense of fluidity that makes using the phone feel more polished and stable. And when you combine that with the OP7T’s vibrant OLED panel, you get an entrancing viewing experience that’s hard to give up when switching back to handsets with standard 60Hz screens.Meanwhile, on the inside, the OP7T features a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ chip that offers 10 to 15 percent better performance for both CPU and GPU. That might not sound like much—to the point you may not notice if you’re just browsing the web or checking in on social media—but in gaming, that extra performance does help you avoid some extra jank or lag than you might have encountered otherwise. And considering Samsung’s latest $1,000 flagship—the Galaxy Note 10—only comes with a vanilla Snapdragon 855 chip, the OP7T’s ample performance is a welcome bonus.However, because of the 7T’s slightly lower price, OnePlus did have to make a few adjustments for some of the phone’s other features. Though for a lot of people, many of OnePlus’ changes could be viewed less as trade-offs, and more like sidegrades that function as a refreshing throwback to a time when phones were just a bit simpler. So instead of the 6.67-inch 3120 x 1440 screen One Plus gave the 7 Pro, the 7T has a 6.55-inch display with a 2400 x 1080 resolution, which is a bit easier to handle for people with smaller hands. The OP7T also has a flat display instead of the curvy 3D glass panel used on the OP7 Pro, which should be a boon to the slice of people that believe phones with sloping displays are harder to use. The OP7T also has a notch for its selfie cam instead of a motorized pop-up, which admittedly isn’t quite as exciting, but does make you feel better about the phone’s lifetime durability. Sadly, after axing the headphone jack on its phones earlier this spring, it seems the days of getting 3.5mm jacks on OnePlus phones are gone for good, as the 7T’s only port is a USB-C connection on the bottom. That’s kind of a shame because if the OP7T had a headphone jack and a removable plastic back, the OP7T would almost be a perfect phone for Android diehards who still reminisce about the glory days of phones like the Galaxy S5. The OP7T’s other major upgrade is the addition of a 16-MP 117-degree ultra-wide camera alongside its 48-MP main cam and 12-MP 2x telephoto cam, which brings triple cameras to the non-pro OnePlus 7 for the first time. With triple rear cameras modules becoming standard equipment for practically every high-end phone this year, it’s nice to see a phone that cost almost half as much hop on that trend as well. OnePlus even added a Super Stabilization mode to the new ultra-wide camera that combines optical and electronic image stabilization to capture smoother, more shake-free videos.That said, while the OP7T image quality is pretty good and more than competent for anyone’s whose main portal for photography is Instagram, in a head-to-head photo comparison between the 7T and true flagship phones like the Note 10, OnePlus still sits a tier behind  Samsung, Google, and Apple.In typical situations like taking pictures of apples at a grocery store or of what I had for dinner, the OP7T’s photos consistently lacked sharpness compared to its more expensive competition, while also going overboard on color saturation. Meanwhile, when I took a picture of a nearby street mural, the OP7T fell just short on things like details and white balance. And with its Nightscape mode turned on, the OP7T had trouble topping Google’s Night Sight on the Pixel 3, producing a darker, yellower final image.Thankfully, the OP7T’s battery is strong, lasting 14 hours and 30 minutes on our video rundown test. That’s almost an hour longer than the OP7 Pro (13:36) and the standard Note 10 (13:46), but still half an hour shy of the Note 10+’s time of 15:05. OnePlus has even upgraded the OP7T’s charging speeds, so that from a completely dead battery, I was able to get a 39 percent charge after 15 minutes, and 73 percent after just half an hour.As for the rest of the phone, OnePlus has kept important features like its handy alert slider, in-display fingerprint reader (which is actually a touch faster than before) and Oxygen OS, which remains super clean and easy to use, and is also one of, if not the first Android skins to get the update to Android 10.While the OnePlus 7T may not be as flashy as some of its competitors or even some of OnePlus’ other handsets, it nails almost all of a phone’s most important features while still packing in a few big-ticket items like its 90Hz screen, in-display fingerprint reader, and triple rear cameras. It’s a simple phone with an almost nostalgic approach. Sure, $600 is double what the original OnePlus cost at launch, but even after all these years, OnePlus is still delivering on its guiding mission of offering big specs at half the price (or close enough) of today’s flagship devices."
39,iPhone 11 pro,https://gizmodo.com/try-to-hate-the-iphone-11-pro-1838252691,"The iPhone 11 Pro is a beautiful phone. There I said it! The matte glass back is elegant. The OLED display is slightly brighter than I expected, which is clever. The trypophobia-inducing camera bump is sleeker than it looks in photos, and the ability to zoom in and out is pretty cool. The iPhone 11 Pro is a little faster. These are all gentle little upgrades from the iPhone XS, and they’re nice. They are, unfortunately for some, all you get. Still, I want this phone because it’s just a little bit nicer than the phone I’ve got. It’s a tired argument to point out how iPhone innovation has stalled. Ten years ago, these little pocket computers were transforming our lives on an annual basis with new features and design upgrades. These days, we’re squinting at specs and doing math to figure out if upgrading to the latest device makes sense for the near future. The one big new thing for all smartphones, 5G, won’t even matter to most people for another year or two or more. And while some Android phone manufacturers are getting creative with new features, most people are now waiting longer to upgrade, giving the major players less motivation to reinvent their devices completely. That seems to be exactly how Apple decided to build the iPhone 11 Pro: surely better but not yet transformative.My problem is that I don’t want to care. I like my iPhone XS just fine. The iPhone 11 Pro isn’t all that radically different, but it is better. It looks better. It feels better. When I use it, I feel good. I don’t care that it can’t support 5G. I don’t mind that Apple left off a bunch of rumored features. I find myself marveling over the little, better things. The matte glass back really does feel luxurious. The display is crisp. The new camera system rocks. I wonder what I could do with this slightly better A13 Bionic processor. I like the iPhone 11 Pro, and given the choice, I would buy it over the more pedestrian but still excellent iPhone 11. Then again, I am falling in line with Apple’s very smart marketing.It would be convenient—and save me a bunch of money—if I could just say that I hate the iPhone 11 Pro. Not the case. I want the damn thing, not because it has a million new mind-boggling tricks but because the few new things are impressive and make the whole experience better. I’m part of the Apple Upgrade Program, so it’s relatively easy for me to trade in my XS for a Pro. I still wouldn’t recommend that folks with an X-series phone upgrade to the 11 Pro. But I dare you not to hate what Apple’s done with its latest masterpiece.Now that my demons are on full display, let’s talk about what makes the iPhone 11 Pro special: the camera. And some other things but mostly the camera.The iPhone 11 Pro is the first and only iPhone to sport three cameras on the back. The setup includes the Wide and Telephoto cameras seen on the iPhone XS as well as a new Ultra Wide camera. This gives the iPhone 11 Pro the ability to zoom in and out. The inclusion of the third camera is also a big differentiator between the Pro and the basic iPhone 11, which only has the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras. (This means the cheaper iPhone 11 does not have an optical zoom in.) It also feels like a bit of a trick. The optical zoom-in has made the second camera on an iPhone feel special since its first appearance in 2016. So if you’re deciding between the regular 11 and the 11 Pro, consider that you’re paying for the telephoto camera more than anything.All the cameras are better, though. This was immediately obvious to me when I started taking photos with the iPhone 11 Pro and compared them to the same shots from the iPhone XS, Google Pixel 3, and Samsung Galaxy S10. The iPhone 11 Pro photos were sharper, more vibrant, and more accurate than those of the competitors. In fact, the difference between the XS and the Pro was so significant, I felt like a dumbass for buying the XS based on the belief that its camera was better than the one on the iPhone X. It was, but by contrast, the iPhone 11 Pro camera feels like a completely new and amazing thing. The biggest deal, to me, is Night mode. It’s mind-blowing, and it’s only available on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. Basically, Night Mode allows you to take photos in near darkness. The option is triggered automatically in the camera app, so you don’t have to bother remembering to turn it on. A little moon icon in the corner of the camera app appears and tells you how long the exposure will last, and then, when you take the photo, you’re given a little countdown that reminds you to keep the camera still. Even if you do wiggle a little, the iPhone will pick a keyframe for sharpness and fill in the details with a composite of additional frames. Given the darkness, you’d expect the finished result to be grainy or blurred, but it’s clear and sharp if a little tinted. I compared Night mode to Google’s similar Night Shift feature on the Pixel 3, and for lack of a better cliché, the difference is like day and night. Apple’s new low light magic can snap useable photos in near darkness, and the results are dramatically different than the same photo from the Pixel 3 camera, which tended to over brighten photos taken in very dim environments creating an unnatural, washed-out look with inaccurate colors. In my tests, Night Mode makes the iPhone XS and Samsung Galaxy S10 cameras look like jokes in low light. I should reiterate, however, that Night mode is available on both the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro. Again, the addition of the telephoto camera and more optical zoom capabilities is what you get by going Pro.The Telephoto camera does feel essential to me. Pressing and holding any of the zoom options in the camera app also brings up a wheel that lets you toggle between a bunch of different focal lengths for more precise zooming. This makes framing photos more intentional, but it’s evident that the Ultra Wide camera introduces some pretty weird distortion, some of which almost looks like a fish-eye lens produced them. I’d also point out that using the focus wheel itself could be smoother, as the sensitivity feels slightly off and it’s easy to notice when the app switches between the three cameras. Regardless, I can already tell that these new zoom options will change the way I take photos with my phone.More than anything, though, the quality of photos taken with iPhone 11 Pro is supreme. Thanks to the new A13 Bionic processor, the phone takes computational photographic magic tricks to a new level.  This is most apparent in the sharpness of the photos. Apple has mercifully fixed the smoothing issue that people complained about on the iPhone XS camera—the one that made details look super soft if you looked closely.Meanwhile, the new iPhone handles difficult lighting situations, like literally shooting straight into the Sun, with remarkable results. Later this year, Apple says it will release a new feature called Deep Fusion that uses machine learning and neural networks to make photos even sharper and more lifelike. This will be available on both the iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 Pro which, again, are two very similar phones in terms of significant features.You can probably see by now that I’m feeling conflicted about the little differences between the $700 iPhone 11 and the $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro. Based on my inventory, there are only five fundamental difference between the two devices. The third camera is one of them. Then, there’s the OLED display on the Pro versus the LCD on the 11—that’s two. The third is the dumb little fact that the iPhone 11 Pro comes with an 18-watt charging brick in the box, whereas you’ll have to pay $30 to get that for the cheaper iPhone 11. Fourth is the better battery life on the iPhone Pro. Battery life is better on all the devices, but Apple says there’s are four more hours of battery on the iPhone 11 Pro than on the iPhone XS. (Five for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.) We struggled to kill these devices in our battery tests. Our iPhone 11 Pro stayed alive well over an hour longer than what Apple’s specs state. Our iPhone 11 Pro Max last an additional hour and change.The fifth thing is what gets me. It’s the design, and it is gorgeous. From the front, the iPhone 11 Pro looks just like the iPhone XS and the iPhone X before it. The notch is still there, and the bezels on the sides are still kind of big compared to, say, a Samsung Galaxy S10. However, the new Pro model is very slightly thicker and wider than its predecessors. The lock button is also slightly lower on the right side of the device, likely to accommodate the new camera bump. I’m tempted to call it a big bump, but it’s remarkable how well Apple has integrated it into the device’s design. In a way, it’s a smaller bump than what’s on my tired XS, because it doesn’t stick out as much. It blends into the glass on the back. That matte back glass is also lovely as hell. It’s annoying how much I like it. The glossy glass back on my iPhone XS always seemed fine, and now I can’t believe how aggressively it attracts fingerprints. The iPhone 11 Pro, by contrast, has that silky smooth matte finish as well as a new oleophobic coating that keeps fingerprints at bay. Apple also says that the new glass is the toughest glass it’s ever put in an iPhone. I learned all too quickly, however, that it’s still not all that tough. In less than a week, I managed to scuff up the front of our iPhone 11 Pro Max review unit. The scratches definitely came from a rivet on my jeans, the same rivet that has scratched the front of my iPhone XS and my Google Pixel 3. It’s an awfully aggressive rivet, but it still stinks that iPhone glass can scratch so easily. It’s also my fault for never using a screen protector. (They bug me!)The more time I spent with the iPhone 11 Pro, the more I dreaded going back to my XS. The more time I spent with the iPhone 11, the more I wished I were using the iPhone 11 Pro. The cheaper iPhone 11 is excellent and offers almost all of the same features as the iPhone 11 Pro. The iPhone 11 Pro, however, looks and feels like the superior device that it is. That premium feeling will cost you at least 300 more dollars, but if you’re someone who really wants to own the best things, that feeling might be worth it. If you’re someone who thinks that the new “pro” moniker on this iPhone means you can do your job better, you’re hallucinating. You do get that one extra camera on the iPhone 11 Pro, but there’s nothing specific to professional smartphoning going on here. Apple did have a demo that showed how the iPhone 11 Pro could record simultaneously on more than one camera, giving videographers the ability to get multiple shots with one device. This feature is also coming to the iPhone 11, XS, and XR. The iPhone 11 Pro is just the fanciest iPhone you can buy right now. Even if it doesn’t turn you into a Hollywood director overnight, you will feel good using the iPhone Pro.  Apple is selling a feeling, after all.The problem is, I’m kind of buying it. While I haven’t made up my mind about upgrading from my (scratched) iPhone XS, I’m sure I’d go for the iPhone 11 Pro if I did decide to get a new device. Cosmetic damage aside, I also don’t need a new device. But I want an iPhone 11 Pro. Even if you don’t want it, you’re going to have a hard time not loving it."
40,iPhone 11,https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-11-is-a-legitimately-great-phone-1838271614,"The iPhone 11 is good. Some of its most touted features might feel more like gimmicks, and I definitely miss a few features limited to the pricier Pro. Still, with its brilliant camera and a handful of other new bits, this is a phone you can upgrade to with little of the usual guilt.This year Apple did away with the confusing branding that marked the last two generations of phones. There’s no oblique letters or weird Arabic versus Roman numeral situation. There’s the iPhone 11, which starts at $700, the slightly smaller $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro, and the slightly larger $1,100 iPhone 11 Pro Max. The primary difference is the two Pros have larger batteries, a 50mm “zoom” lens, and much better displays. The cool features Apple talked about at its event last week, including “slofies,” the A13 Bionic processor, Night mode, improved image capture, ultra-wideband, and an ultrawide lens, are present across all three devices. So if you’re considering an upgrade for slofies or better night photography, you can save $300 to $400 and just get the iPhone 11. Apple refusing, for the most part, to hamstring the most affordable iPhone in its 2019 refresh is a wonderful thing.Apple still holds it back, though. In some cases it’s minor—the phone’s glossy glass is slippery and more prone to fingerprints than the matte oleophobic back of the Pro, and the bezels are a hair bigger. But other differences are not so minor. In our battery test, in which we set the brightness of the display to 200 nits and stream a YouTube video until the phone dies, the iPhone 11 gets over 12 hours. Impressive compared to the 9 hours the iPhone 8 got and decent versus the just under 12 hours the XR lasted. But the Pro lasted over 13 hours, and the Pro Max lasted over 15 hours. Apparently, battery life is a Pro kind of thing.The Pros both have higher-quality displays, too. The 11's LCD is very, very good for an LCD and in our testing hit a respectable 550 nits indoors—just barely brighter than the Pros. Outdoors it suffered though. It was nearly 150 nits dimmer than both Pros when tested in direct sunlight.Worse, it’s kind of fuzzy. The iPhone 11's 6.1-inch LCD  has a 1,792 by 828 resolution and 326 pixels per inch. That leaves everything feeling a lot less clean compared to the 458 pixels per inch in the Pro’s 5.8-inch 2,436 by 1,125 display or the Pro Max’s 6.5-inch 2,688 by 1,242 display. It’s especially noticeable where the bezel meets the display. With the Pros, there’s a very crisp delineation between the bezel and the display. With the iPhone 11, there’s a very slight gradient.As for the features found across all the new iPhones. Some of those new features feel a little less critical than others. A new ultra-wideband radio should make Airdropping files faster, but it only works with other devices that have a compatible (right now, that’s mainly just the new iPhone). The Ultra Wide camera feels distinctly like a gimmick too. I want you to take a moment and sort through the last dozen or so photos you took. Recall the moments before you hit the shutter button. Did you feel the need to step back and get more of the subject in frame? Or did you feel the need to step forward? If you’re like me, you tend to zoom in, not out. I don’t need to zoom out from a 26mm f/2.0 lens to a 13mm f/2.4 lens.Particularly because that Ultra Wide camera has issues with low light. Shooting in the shadows during the golden hour seemed to dramatically affect the quality of images from the Ultra Wide camera versus the Wide one.My more significant issue with the Ultra Wide camera is that it’s just ridiculously distorted compared to the Wide camera. The edges of the frame curve with the lens. It requires you to fix the distortion in photo editing software or to embrace it fully.Embracing the distortion does mean you can pull off some really dramatic and artsy shots, like the ones below of a neon sign or the shot of my dog sniffing the sun. I ultimately found myself thinking of the ultra-wide-angle as something more akin to filters in Portrait mode. It’s cool, and it gives me neat flexibility, but it’s unnecessary most of the time.Night mode, on the other hand, is a revelation. Apple is very late to using computational photography to improve images taken in dark settings. Google beat it by nearly a year, and Samsung introduced a dedicated night mode with the Galaxy S10 this past March. With the new A13 Bionic chip, Apple can lean heavily on the phone’s CPU to crunch numbers in photos.Mostly, Night mode works like magic, but there are caveats. The mode only works with the Wide camera. So there won’t be any ultra-dramatic ultra-wide shots. Also, your subject can’t move around, and you have to hold the phone pretty still for one to two seconds (it depends on how low the light is). You have to wait for the phone to process the images too. So there’s a slight gap between tapping the shutter button and getting your picture.The A13 Bionic CPU and a new, improved front camera also mean better selfies and slightly faster Face ID. It will be responsible for powering the new Deep Fusion mode, which combines a series of photos to make one super sharp photo, that’s expected later this year too. Plus slofies, the silliest new feature in a phone. Slofies are just as easy to shoot as a slow-motion video with the rear camera—and just as subject to proper lighting. Don’t try and pull off a slofie in a dark bar, or you’ll be as disappointed as I was. Slofies in good light are fun, and I’ve no doubt the creators (teens) of Tik Tok will find new and spectacularly delightful uses for the feature.Oddly enough, the part of the camera that impressed me the most was also one of the least widely touted features: the dynamic range. Dynamic range is critical to a good photo. Better dynamic range means way more details in really bright and really dark areas of your photos.The feature was most noticeable when I was shooting the sunset. I could see all the details in the shadows and still get a bright sun and sky. Apple’s been steadily improving the dynamic range in its camera module, and the difference between photos shot on the 11 and my two-year-old iPhone X are so dramatic I have a powerful desire to upgrade.In fact, I probably will. I’m not crazy about the size of the phone—I just find it too large and uncomfortable to use with one hand. That, plus better battery life and more flexibility in the rear cameras, has me eyeing the Pro over the iPhone 11. Apple could benefit from producing an iPhone 11 you can hold in your hands without being a giant. But the low price and delightful array of vibrant colors make the 11 a damn fine option versus the Pro. If you don’t have last year’s iPhone, and you’re looking to upgrade, you won’t be disappointed. This is a superb phone."
41,Galaxy Note 10,https://gizmodo.com/galaxy-note-10-review-a-smaller-note-makes-for-better-1838063003,"When Samsung announced the arrival of two versions of its latest Galaxy Note—the 6.3-inch Note 10 and the 6.8-inch Note 10+—it signaled a small departure from previous years. In spirit, the Galaxy Note 10+ is the true successor to Samsung’s iconic big-screen phone line, while the standard Note 10 seems like something Samsung’s bean counters dreamed up as a way of broadening the market for the company’s latest high-end phone. However, aside from simply having a smaller screen, the Note 10 also lacks a few specs and features found on its bigger sibling. This forces us to ask if Samsung’s recent attempt to adapt the Galaxy Note for people with smaller hands has also watered down a phone that is typically defined by an excess of power and features.The answer: In short, no. Despite having slightly less impressive features, the normal Galaxy Note 10 retains almost everything that makes the Note 10+ one of the most well-rounded, accommodating handsets on the market.OK, so what’s actually different between the Note 10 and Note 10+? In addition to having a smaller 6.3-inch OLED screen, the Note 10's display also comes with a lower max resolution of 2280 x 1080 as opposed to the 3040 x 1440 display you get on the Note 10+. When you put the two side-by-side and look real close, it’s possible to discern a slight decrease in sharpness and pixel density. That said, if you pull your nose back a bit, those differences largely disappear, and what you’re left with is still one of the most vibrant and best-looking smartphone screens on the market. And because Samsung moved the Note 10's 10-MP punch-hole selfie cam to the middle from the corner like you get on a Galaxy S10, the front cam tends to disappear within the phone’s notification bar more easily.Inside, the Note 10's Snapdragon 855 chip offers expectedly top-notch performance, though because Samsung opted not to include a microSD card slot on the standard Note 10, the new 256GB of base storage becomes even more important. And while 256GB is probably more space than most people need—even the sort of power users that tend to gravitate towards Samsung’s Galaxy Notes—not getting expandable storage on any Note still stings a bit.As for the Note 10's 8GB of RAM (versus 12GB for the Note 10+), that discrepancy is harder to discern, as it always seemed the Note 10 plus had ample memory to keep tons of software suspended in the background without needing to reload apps constantly.And finally, there come the Note 10's rear cameras, which are comprised of a 12-MP main cam, 12-MP 2x telephoto cam, and a 16-MP ultra-wide-angle cam. This is the same setup found on both the Galaxy S10 and the Note 10+, with the only thing missing from the standard Note 10 being the 10+’s 3D time-of-flight camera.But out of all the things the Note 10 lacks compared to the Note 10+, the time-of-flight sensor is by far the easiest to forgive. The Note 10 can still use Samsung’s new Live Focus video mode with almost no difference in quality, which means the only thing you can’t do is use Samsung’s Quick Measure app to approximate the size of nearby objects. Not really a huge loss.When it comes to regular photos, the number of different cameras and focal lengths gives you a ton of flexibility to capture pretty much any scene. Sure, in absolute terms, Google’s Night Sight Mode on the Pixel 3 is slightly more adept at taking low-light shots than Samsung’s Bright Night option, but the results are often quite close, and it’s clear the Note 10's image quality is still top tier.Finally, the Note 10 has a smaller 3,500 mAh battery compared to the 4,300 mAh power pack in the Note 10+. Though that difference in capacity doesn’t translate into quite as big a gap in battery life as the numbers might suggest. In our video rundown test, the Note 10 lasted 13 hours and 46 minutes compared to the Note 10+’s time of 15:05. As for the rest of the phone, between features like its in-display fingerprint reader, hidden rear mic (which allows the phone to isolate noise better when you zoom in while recording a video), and Samsung’s dazzling new Aura Glow finish, the Note 10 always feels like it’s up for a challenge, regardless if you’re gaming or just trying to get some work done. I must admit, though, I feel like some of the Note 10's other new abilities like its Air Actions (which allow you to change camera modes by waving the S Pen around) and AR Doodle (which lets you draw augmented reality sketches in the air) are fun for a short time, but ultimately feel kind of gimmicky. And of course, there’s the built-in S Pen, which remains a unique feature in the smartphone world. You can use it to make gifs, help translate text into other languages, sketch, and now on the Note 10, convert handwritten notes into digital text that can be exported to a number of formats including PDFS, Word docs, and more. If you want a stylus but with a phone that’s not quite as unwieldy as the 6.8-inch Note 10+, well that’s pretty much exactly why the standard Note 10 exists. Really, aside from some minor differences in specs and Samsung axing the headphone jack for 2019's Galaxy Note, it’s hard to find a lot of fault with Note 10. In fact, right now, at $950, the standard Note 10 costs $50 less than a comparable Galaxy S10+, which offers nearly an extra 1.5 hours of battery life, but at the expense of not having an S Pen. So unless having a microSD card slot and a headphone jack are deal-breakers, the newer Note 10 is actually a better deal. Just be careful to pay attention to price changes, because with the S10+ having gone on sale back in the spring, it may get hit with a round of discounts sooner. But still, just because it doesn’t have a massive display or the fancy time-of-flight sensor found on its bigger and slightly more exciting sibling, the standard Note 10 is still embodies the best qualities of Samsung’s power-user phone line while also being a bit easier to handle. "
42,Galaxy Note 10,https://gizmodo.com/the-galaxy-note-10-is-damn-near-perfect-1837443425,"When a phone retails at $1,100, it can’t just be good, it has to be superb. It needs to deliver features you don’t get on other phones, maintain excellence across all the standard metrics, and be able to handle pretty much any situation, whether it’s work, play, or just a bit of movie watching. And while there are a few things I wish Samsung had included on its latest big-screen flagship, the Galaxy Note 10+ is damn near perfect.One of the most impressive things about the Note 10+ is that despite being practically the same size (6.39 x 3.04 x 0.31 inches) as last year’s Galaxy Note 9 (6.37 x 3.01 x 0.35 inches), Samsung managed to streamline its design, allowing for a big jump up in screen size from 6.4-inches to 6.8-inches. It’s an astonishing feat. However, for those worried about being overwhelmed by a phone this big, for the first time in Note history, Samsung made a smaller version of its flagship phone in the standard Note 10, which has a 6.3-inch screen with a lower max resolution of 2280 x 1080 (versus 3040 x 1440 for the Note 10+). We’re expecting to a standard Note 10 in for review shortly, so check back soon if you’re interested in the new, smaller model. For 2019, nearly everywhere you look, you can see thoughtful little design tweaks that elevate the Note 10+ above other big-screen competitors. On the top edge of the phone, Samsung added a couple of small holes so that the Note 10's stereo speakers have more room to breathe, allowing for more balanced audio. Meanwhile, around back, Samsung created an almost imperceptible slit at the base of the Note 10+’s camera module, which is what makes the phone’s Zoom-in Audio feature possible (more on that later). And like any good flagship phone these days, the Note 10 features an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.Samsung even streamlined the Note 10's buttons by removing the dedicated Bixby button Samsung included on Galaxy phones the past couple years. By default, the lock button (which is now called the “side key”) summons Bixby with a double press, but it can be customized to be a standard power button, or set to summon an app of your choice. And by moving the lock button over the left side of the phone, the right side is now just a clean strip of glass and aluminum. That said, long-time Note fans will have to get used to the lock button being on the left, which is jarring at first but easily overcome.And while I normally don’t do this, I have to give special attention to the Note 10's signature Aura Glow color scheme. By adopting a process used when fabricating its processors, Samsung created a downright enchanting finish. Depending on your surroundings, the Note 10 can be all the colors of the rainbow, shifting from its neutral silver finish to blue, red, green, and more—like a chameleon paint job from the early 2000s on steroids. It’s definitely striking, but admittedly may not be everyone’s style.As for the Note 10+’s screen, I just can’t get enough. Everything you put on it just looks fantastic. To very little surprise, DisplayMate says its screen features “textbook calibration accuracy and performance that is visually indistinguishable from perfect.” One of my few gripes with the Note 10+ is that Samsung didn’t include support for higher refresh rates. We already know it is capable of making that kind of tech, as Samsung made the 90Hz screen featured on the OnePlus 7 Pro, and after seeing the smoothness and fluidity high refresh rate screens can offer, I think it’s something every high-end phone should have in the future. Then again, if upping the refresh rate from 60Hz to 90Hz came at the expense of color saturation or accuracy, that’s a tough choice to make, so I’m not all that upset. There’s always next year. Also, to provide a more balanced, Zen-like appearance, Samsung moved the Note 10's punch-hole selfie cam to the middle of the screen. At first, I thought this might be more distracting than the corner placement Samsung used on the Galaxy S10, but by shrinking the size of the camera hole, Samsung was able to reduce the overall height of the notification bar, which prevents the punch-hole from becoming a nuisance. If literally the only thing you care about is having a big, uninterrupted screen, the OnePlus 7 Pro might still be a better option, but for everyone else, the Note 10+ wins.And while Samsung’s in-screen fingerprint sensor doesn’t affect display quality, one of the most pleasant surprises with the Note 10+ is how much faster its fingerprint recognition is compared to the Galaxy S10. The S10's in-screen fingerprint reader was a good replacement for rear-mounted options, but whatever Samsung did to the Note 10's sensor had made it noticeably superior.When Samsung first announced the Note 10 was going to have a Snapdragon 855 chip instead of the Snapdragon 855 Plus, I was a bit disappointed. But seeing as how one of the few other phones slated to feature the 855 Plus—the Asus ROG Phone 2— still isn’t out, it’s hard to be that mad. Besides, everywhere else, the Note 10+ is absolutely stacked, featuring 12GB of RAM (which is especially handy for anyone planning on using Samsung’s DeX desktop mode), with storage doubling from 128GB to 256GB for 2019. If that’s not enough, there’s a 512GB storage option, plus a microSD card slot (which is one of the main features the standard Note 10 doesn’t have).In short, the Note 10+ simply flies. Throughout my time with the phone, I didn’t notice a single hitch or bout of lag, while on benchmarks, the Note 10+ posted the highest WebXPRT (which measures web browsing speeds) scores I’ve seen yet. The Note 10+ also posted similar graphics scores to the OnePlus 7 Pro, with the Note 10+ hitting 7,751 on 3D Mark’s Slingshot Unlimited graphics test, compared to the OP7 Pro’s score of 7,697.As always, the Note line’s most iconic feature remains a unicorn even among the most sophisticated phones. However, I admit that in today’s world where pretty much every phone has solid a touchscreen, a lot of people might not see the need for a stylus. But for those who do, the S-Pen is a huge boon for productivity, with Samsung’s handwriting-to-text conversion feature being easily the most important new addition to this year’s Note. If you’re like me and prefer to write notes or reminders by hand instead of typing them into a computer, being able to convert an entire meeting’s worth of handwritten info into plain text that can be exported to a Word doc, PDF or email is a massive time saver. And even with my awful handwriting, the Note 10+ was consistently accurate.This feature isn’t perfect because during the conversion process, the Note 10+ adds a lot of unnecessary line breaks that means you might have to go back and reformat the final text, but that’s a minor inconvenience compared to having to transcribe your notes all over again. In fact, now that the new S-Pen text conversion exists, I find myself wishing it had better integration with other apps, so I could more easily respond to texts and messages using the S-Pen, instead of relying on the somewhat less adept handwriting recognition in the default Samsung keyboard.The other new S-Pen abilities include Air Actions, which let you change between camera modes and settings by waving the S-Pen around like a wand, and AR Doodle. From my experience, Air Actions performed as expected, but since these gestures are currently limited to use in the camera app, I don’t find them all that useful. Sure, you can take a picture by clicking the button the S-Pen, but you could do that on last year’s Note 9 too.It’s sort of a similar situation for AR Doodle, which lets you draw shapes and creations in 3D space, like a more mobile version of Google’s Tilt Brush. I’m not the kind of person who gets a lot of joy from drawing fake mustaches on people’s faces, so while it might be fun for a bit, I largely forgot about it after a couple uses.One of the most welcome additions to the Note 10 is a third 16-MP ultra-wide-angle camera alongside the phone’s 12-MP main cam and 12-MP 2x telephoto cam. This gives the Note 10+ tons of flexibility that Apple and Google’s current flagships can’t match, at least not yet.Overall image quality is strong across the board. Google still has an advantage in low-light thanks to Night Sight, but the Note 10+ excels in bright light, often outshooting its biggest competitors. The best example of this is a photo I grabbed of some clouds at sunset. While the colors in the iPhone XS’ shot appeared muted, and the Pixel 3's pic was underexposed, the Note 10+’s photo was vivid and instantly engaging.On top of all this, the Note 10+ also has a time-of-flight sensor that can be used to enhance the camera’s depth effects, though any improvements over what you get from the Galaxy S10 are hard to pick out. I  appreciate that the time-of-flight camera can also be used with Samsung’s Quick Measure app to size up nearby objects. Samsung’s Live Focus Video benefits the most from the Note 10+’s time-of-flight sensor, as it allows you to adjust bokeh and depth of field in the middle of recording, which is nice, but it’s also not something most people will use daily.That makes Samsung’s Zoom-in Audio the Note 10's most interesting new camera feature, partly because it works without needing to turn on any special modes or playing with the settings, so that you can highlight and isolate noises from whatever you’re pointing the camera at. With a 4,300 mAh battery, the Note 10+ has the biggest battery on any Note to date. This is a welcome improvement, as it ensures the Note 10+ can deliver all-day longevity, even for the sort of power users that gravitate towards super-premium phones. In typical use, I often finished a day with 40 percent battery remaining. In our battery rundown test, the Note 10+ lasted 15 hours and five minutes at its default 2280 x 1080 resolution (or 13:25 when the phone is set to its full 3040 x 1440 resolution), with puts its in elite territory alongside phones like the Galaxy S10+ (15:09) and the Huawei P30 Pro (15:24).When it comes to recharging, the Note 10 has gotten a boost thanks to support for up to 45-watt wired charging and 15-watt Qi wireless charging. Sadly, the accessories you need to get the Note 10's max charging speeds don’t come included, as the wired power adapter that comes with a phone is just a 25-watt charger.I wish Samsung had at least included the 45-watt charger, as people buying a phone this expensive shouldn’t have to shell out more for a second charger. That said, the standard 25-watt is actually pretty damn quick, as it’s able to take the Note 10 from 5 percent battery to 40 percent in just 15 minutes. Not bad.Officially, Samsung says the Note 10 works best with Samsung charging accessories. However, since the Note 10+ uses industry standards such as USB-PD and Qi wireless charging to get those peak speeds, you can use compliant high-wattage third-party chargers if you don’t want to shell out extra. And you should, because when I connected the Note 10+ to a 60-watt Apple power adapter, I was able to go from 5 percent to just under 55 percent in the same 15 minutes.Somewhat annoyingly, some of the Note 10's other advanced features such as its 3D scanning app and the Play Galaxy Link App aren’t available yet. I’ve reached out to Samsung for info on when these will be available, so check back soon more updates.In the end, while no phone is utterly impeccable, the Note 10+ comes incredibly close. It’s got big power, big specs, and the biggest, most glorious display you can get right now. Sure, the lack of a 90Hz screen and a headphone jack might make this phone non-starter for some, the S-Pen’s Air Actions are a solution in search of a problem, and Samsung’s low-light mode isn’t quite as good as Google’s Night Sight.But these quibbles are just tiny knocks against what is otherwise the most flexible and well-equipped phone on the market. Between its built-in stylus and productivity potential, the Note 10+ doesn’t really have a competitor that delivers anywhere near the same experience. This makes the Note 10+’s biggest hurdle its high price tag. But if you can swing it (or find a deal), the Note 10+ is still the closest thing we have to the true everything phone. "
43,Galaxy A50,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-a50-review-the-new-budget-smartphone-to-1836488108,"At this point, everyone is at least aware of Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S phones like the Galaxy S10 and S10+, and its slightly less expensive sibling, the $750 Galaxy S10e. However, as soon as you look beyond those for something even more affordable, Samsung’s portfolio gets messy real quick.Between Samsung’s various budget and mid-range offerings, there are a dizzying number of phones that all kind of seem the same. To make things even more confusing, depending on what carrier you’re on, the same phone might have two different names as we see with T-Mobile’s Galaxy J7 Star and Verizon’s Galaxy J7 V 2nd Gen. With $350 Galaxy A50, Samsung is clearing out the clutter and going after some of the best budget and mid-range handsets on the market. With a retail price of $350, the Galaxy A50 slots neatly between the $300 Moto G7 and the $400 Pixel 3a. It also incorporates a couple of features the other two don’t have, like dual rear cameras and an in-display fingerprint reader. From the outside, the Galaxy A50 looks quite similar to the Moto G7. Both phones have selfie cams that sit on a central notch that dips into their screens, big, mostly bezel-less displays, and smooth rounded backs. However, when you look closer, you begin to notice that everything looks and feels a bit more polished on the Galaxy A50. The A50's bezels are slimmer, its chin is smaller, and despite being practically the same size, Samsung crammed a 6.4-inch 2340 x 1080 OLED screen onto the Galaxy A50, while the Moto G7 has to make do with a 6.2-inch 2270 x 1080 LCD. So not only is the A50's screen bigger, it’s brighter and more colorful too. Both phones come with headphone jacks and microSD card slots for expandable storage. But in back, the A50 features a  25-MP primary camera, along with an 8-MP 123-degree wide-angle camera and a bonus 5-MP depth-sensing camera to help with portrait-style shots. That’s a nice improvement over the single cams found on pretty much every other phone in this price range. And while the A50's back is plastic instead of glass like you get on the G7, Samsung officially calls that material “glasstic” (I’m not kidding), and it’s damn hard to tell the difference.In terms of photography, the Galaxy A50 consistently topped the G7 too, thanks to generally better sharpness, color saturation, and particularly, low-light performance. Really, in almost every way, the A50 is just a better device than the Moto G7. However, when put up against the Pixel 3a, the Galaxy A50 falls short. Even though it has one less camera in back, the Pixel 3a’s photo quality is way better, producing shots with better details and clarity than any other phone in this price range. Take, for example, a shot of some flowers taken by both phones (See the gallery below). While the A50's shot is bright and vivid, its color saturation overwhelms details like the wrinkles on the flowers’ petals. And in low-light, the Pixel 3a delivers better sensitivity, resulting in a brighter, more well-exposed pic. Because the A50 doesn’t have a dedicated night mode, turning on the Pixel 3a’s Night Sight makes the gap in image quality between the two phones even more extreme. It’s a similar story for performance, where on benchmarks like WebXPRT 2015, Geekbench 4, and 3DMark, the A50 and Moto G7 turned in comparable results. On Geekbench 4, the Galaxy A50 (5,536) edged out the Moto G7 (4,624), which echoes real-world performance where the G7 suffers from more lag and UI stutter than the A50. The Pixel 3a is the smoothest of the bunch thanks to its Snapdragon 670 chip (versus the Exynos 9610 in the A50). It scores significantly better in 3DMark’s slingshot Unlimited test (the Pixel 3a hit 2,581, which is 50 percent higher than the A50's score of 1,682). And when it comes to battery life, with a time of 12 hours and 17 minutes on our video rundown test, the Galaxy A50's 4,000 mAh battery absolutely crushed the G7's mark of 9:29. Meanwhile, the Pixel 3a fared just barely worse at 11:51, while the larger Pixel 3a XL was a tiny bit better with a time of 12:43. This hierarchy even extends to features like the speaker (or speakers) on each phone, because while the Moto G7 and Galaxy A50 have mono speakers, the Pixel 3a offers true stereo sound. (Though I should point out that unlike the other two, the Pixel 3a doesn’t have an SD card slot.)The A50's only real issue is its in-display fingerprint sensor. I want to give Samsung credit for putting such a techy feature on a budget device, but in my experience, using it can be a bit hit or miss. Typically, it had no issue reading my digits, but occasionally, it took three or four taps to unlock the phone. And even after re-registering my prints multiple times, I couldn’t fix the issue. The most important factor in determining which one of these devices to buy is price. The $350 Galaxy A50 is better in practically every way than the $300 Moto G7, but it costs $50 more. Then there’s the Pixel 3a. At $400, it’s more of a mid-range device. On the other hand, it has stereo speakers, superior performance, and the best camera of the lot.Though if you can find deals like this one from B&H that has the Galaxy A50 for $280, Samsung’s new budget handset is an easy pick. But more importantly, it seems like Samsung is putting more effort into its affordable phones. With the price of modern flagship phones pushing $1,000 or more, increased competition in the budget/mid-range segments is something celebrate. "
44,Nubia Red Magic 3,https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-best-gaming-phone-yet-1836042872,"Less than two years ago, gaming phones weren’t even a thing. But now, they are an entire category unto themselves. Asus made one, Xiaomi made one (with another on the way), and Razer made two. And while there are some people that continue to question why they are even necessary, it’s important to note that the superb 90Hz screen on the OnePlus 7 Pro is almost certainly a response to the high refresh rate screens that first debuted on various gaming phones. These phones influence the broader category of phones. But in the case of the Nubia Red Magic 3 that might not be a great thing. I’m not sure I’ll want to see it’s built-in fan in next year’s OnePlus. Still, its features like that (and an excellent price)that make this the best gaming phone yet.Seriously, the Red Magic 3 has pretty much everything you could ever want in a gaming phone. It’s got a huge 6.65-inch screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, stereo speakers, the latest Snapdragon 855 chip from Qualcomm, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and, of course, an RGB light strip around back. It even has a red and black color scheme that delivers that classic gamer aesthetic, and while its triangular accents on the back are a bit aggressive, they aren’t overly so.Like the Razer Phone 2, the Red Magic 3 has powerful stereo speakers, but to make the phone even more pleasant to hold while gaming, Nubia gave its gaming phone curvy sides and rounded corners so that it doesn’t jab your palms like Razer’s handset does. And while the Red Magic 3 still has bezels above and below its screen, they’re smaller than what’s on the Razer Phone 2 and also quite proportional, which gives the whole device a satisfying a balanced look and feel, which is good because this thing is heavy.Between its 6.65-inch AMOLED 2,340 by 1,080 screen, and its thick metal back, the Red Magic 3 is an absolute unit. When viewed side-by-side next to the Galaxy Note 9 or a OnePlus 66 Pro, the Red Magic 3 is noticeably larger than both. But that thick body comes with its benefits, because it means the Red Magic 3 has room for a SIM tray with an extra microSD card slot, a headphone jack, and Nubia’s hidden party trick, a built-in active cooling fan like you’d get on a gaming PC.At first, putting a fan in a phone seems like a silly idea. But when you think about it some more, you start to wonder why not. Heat is the enemy of performance, and anyone who’s played PUBG Mobile has almost certainly noticed how warm a phone can get after just a couple rounds. But putting a fan in a phone only makes sense if that fan actually helps cool the device. So to test its effectiveness, I performed two stress tests that involved running 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme graphics test 10 times in a row to simulate a demanding gaming session; once with no help from the fans, and once with the fan turned on full blast. And you know what? Sadly, it seems that fan is more style than function.After 10 runs of Slingshot Extreme without the fan, the Red Magic 3 posted a score of 5,051, compared to a score of 5,255 with the phone’s fan set on full blast. That’s an increase of just under 5-percent, which isn’t nothing, but not quite enough to really crow about. (The Red Magic 3 posted a score of 6,354 when run after a cold boot.) However, during additional testing, I noticed that having the fan turned when you first fire up some games does help prevent your  hands from getting sweaty. So at least you know when you hear that tiny hand dryer spin up, you’re getting everything you can out of Red Magic 3 while gaming.The Red Magic 3's built-in fan isn’t its only gaming feature though, as Nubia gave the phone a dedicated gaming mode complete with its own hardware switch. At first, I thought the red slider on the side of the phone was a mute switch or an alert toggle like you get an iPhone or OnePlus phone. But no, flipping that switch activates a dedicated UI that puts all your gaming apps front and center while also giving you a handful of special features and live system info. With the Reg Magic’s gaming mode turned on, you can see the temperature inside the phone, the clock speed of your CPU and GPU, and even the speed of your data connection.There are nifty shortcuts for taking screenshots, blocking incoming messages, toggling the fan on and off, and something called 4D Shock, which basically adds a rumble effect to select games. Unfortunately, right now the list of supported titles stands at just four: PUBG Mobile, Knives Out, Asphalt 9, and QQ Speed. But my favorite gaming feature of them all is Nubia’s touch button controls, which lets you customize the Red Magic’s two side-mounted touchpads so you can use them as shoulder buttons. It’s perfect for battle royale games like Fortnite and PUBG, and because the touch controls can be adjusted for whatever your playing, there’s no limit to the possibilities.However, all of these tools and features do take some getting used to, as booting straight into game mode can be overwhelming at first. There are also a ton of different settings for the Red Magic 3's rear RGB light strip, which can be accessed from the phone’s game mode, or customized in the standard Android settings menu.The Red Magic 3's software is my biggest gripe, because while the phone does come with Android 9, I ran into a couple of situations where the phone froze or got hung up temporarily. None of these situations were more than minor inconveniences and were typically fixed by closing an app and restarting it. But still, issues like that shouldn’t happen at all. On top of that, despite getting a new system update at the end of June, the phone is still running on Google’s Android security patch from March. At least the Red Magic’s battery life is strong. With a time of 13 hours and 15 minutes on our rundown test, the Red Magic 3 crushed the Razer Phone 2's time of 9:45, and also topped the ROG Phone’s time of 12:57.As for the Red Magic 3's 48-MP camera, despite having just a single lens (which is actually somewhat refreshing in today’s world of double, triple, and quadruple camera phones), its image quality is decent. In bright light, the Red Magic 3's pics looked sharp (though not as colorful as those from competitors) and at night, it even grabbed a shot with better white balance than what I got from a Galaxy S10. But overall, the Red Magic’s camera is clear step down from what you’d get on a flagship phone from Apple, Samsung, or Google. That’s OK! It’s not really the main focus of the phone anyways.But here’s the real shocker, the Red Magic 3 costs just $480. That’s more than $300 less than the Razer Phone 2 and $400 less than Asus ROG Phone for better specs, longer battery life, more colorful lights, and a wide array of gaming features. And if that’s not enough, there’s a higher spec model with 12GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and a camo paint job, plus Nubia’s optional controller accessory and optional desktop dock. I wish Nubia put a bit more polish on the Red Magic’s software and spent more time providing timely security updates. Yet for mobile gaming fanatics looking for a big phone at a great price, the Red Magic 3 can’t be denied. "
45,Asus Zenfone 6,https://gizmodo.com/this-is-a-flipping-cool-500-phone-1835631539,"Almost as quickly as notches appeared on phones, phone makers started looking for even more aggressive ways to hide a selfie cam including things like punch holes and hidden pop-ups. But even among the rare handsets with motorized cameras, the Asus Zenfone 6 stands alone. This thing is powerful, affordable, and unlike most of its competitors, it has personality.That’s because, in addition to letting the phone’s rear cam transform into a selfie cam at a moment’s notice, the camera’s innovative powered hinge also lets you capture every angle in between. In a way, it’s almost like having a phone that’s mounted to one of those fancy slider rigs used in  video shoots. Using a handy software slider, you can angle the camera from side-to-side, or switch to a 125-degree ultra-wide angle lens if you need a bigger view. The only thing it can’t do is zoom, but then again, I suppose you’ve got your legs for that.But manual camera controls are just the start, as Asus also added some nifty features that take advantage of the Zenfone 6 camera’s adjustability. The first is a special panorama mode that automatically swings the camera up to a full 180, capturing every angle along the way before stitching everything into a single extra-wide image. But perhaps even more impressive is the Zenfone’s motion tracking feature, that takes advantage of the camera’s motorized hinge to follow a selected subject, and hopefully keep them in frame. Granted, both of the features are somewhat specialized, but for vloggers or mobile video fanatics, the Zenfone 6 still offers a list of camera features that you can’t really get on other devices. Also, for a phone not made by Google, Samsung, or Huawei, the Zenfone’s image quality ain’t bad. In a shot of some happy cows, the Zenfone 6 captured a bright, colorful photo that anyone would be happy to post on Instagram. Though, if you zoom in a bit, you can see that Asus’ image processing has resulted in some over sharpening. Next, in a handful of head-to-head comparisons, the Zenfone 6 mostly kept pace with the Galaxy S10+ when snapping a pic of Buddha in a dimly lit restaurant. Even though the Galaxy S10+ did edge out the Zenfone 6 thanks to a slightly brighter exposure and finer details on the brick in back, the Zenfone wasn’t that far behind.In shootout to snap some freshly steamed dumplings, the Zenfone 6 once again mostly kept up with the Pixel 3, though Google’s HDR+ processing did give the Pixel’s pic an advantage in color saturation. However, the one area where Asus can’t quite compete is in very low light situations. That’s because while Asus did give the Zenfone 6 a dedicated night mode, it can’t really touch what Google is doing with Night Sight. Just check out the two pictures of a local street mural with and without each phone’s respective night mode turned on to see what I mean. However, as fun and novel as the Zenfone’s camera is, it wouldn’t be enough to save the device if everything else was garbage. Thankfully, that’s not the case, because despite sporting a price tag of around $500, the  Zenfone 6 has flagship-level specs including a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, 8GB of RAM, up to 256GB of storage, a built-in microSD card slot, and a headphone jack. That’s the same as what you get on a Samsung Galaxy S10, though the S10+ does come in a config with 512GB of storage if you need it. Asus has even kept a very light touch on Android 9, offering near stock version of Google’s mobile OS. Oh, and the 5,000 mAh battery in the Zenfone 6 is just ridiculous. On our video rundown test, it lasted 15 hours and 9 minutes. This puts Zenfone 6 on the same level as much more expensive phones like the Huawei P30 Pro (15:24) and the Galaxy S10+ (15:09), and with Asus’ newly implemented 18-watt quick-charging, you’ll be able to juice it back up faster too. Other differences between the Zenfone 6 and the Galaxy S10 include a rear capacitive touch fingerprint sensor instead of one that’s built into its screen, and a dedicated voice assistant button that by default summons Google instead of Bixby—which is a switch that probably won’t upset anyone. You even get stereo sound thanks to the Zenfone’s use of a bottom-firing speaker that works in conjunction with the thin speaker grille located above the display.The Zenfone 6 is missing a few staples you tend to get on more expensive phones though, such as support for wireless charging and water-resistance. On a phone in this price range, the lack of wireless charging is sad, but somewhat understandable, while the lack of wireless charging is almost certainly due to the powered motor that allow the phone’s camera to tilt up and down.But since the Zenfone 6's camera is also what allows it to not have any distractions taking away from its big, 6.4-inch screen, it might be worthwhile compromise, particularly if you aren’t a big fan of taking selfie.  With a peak brightness of 577 nits, the Zenfone 6 has no issues with outdoor visibility, but because Asus opted for an LCD panel instead of OLED, colors aren’t quite as rich or vibrant as what you’d see on a OnePlus 7 or Galaxy S10. But here’s the big question: How long is that motorized camera going to survive. Honestly, I have no idea. Asus claims the Zenfone 6's camera has a reinforced motors with 13 gears, which should give the phone some much-needed toughness. And when you set up the camera to also unlock the phone using face recognition, the speed at which the camera comes to attention is actually pretty impressive. But in manual mode, tilting the camera isn’t really what I’d call smooth, and the whole time you use it, you can feel those motors whirring away inside. That means depending on who you ask, the Zenfone’s popup cam is a whimsical call back to something like a motorized Erector sets, or a haunting reminder of the phone’s fragility.So even though I spent a good chunk of my time with the Zenfone 6 worrying if its motorized camera was about to conk out, I still can’t help but appreciate what Asus had created. Compared to other phones in this price range like the Moto Z4 or the OnePlus 6T, the Zenfone 6 offers better specs, better battery life, and something else you don’t find in a lot of phones: personality. The harder choice is trying to choose between the cheaper $400 Pixel 3a and its flagship-class cameras, or the novel camera and brawny components of the Zenfone 6. In many ways, the Zenfone 6 is a better value, but at the same time I know not everyone can handle a phone this funky. "
46,Moto Z4,https://gizmodo.com/the-moto-z4-is-a-solid-mid-range-contender-but-it-migh-1835321416,"While Samsung, Apple, Huawei, and others continue to push out $1,000 phones, Motorola has run in the other direction and completely abandoned the flagship market. That’s a pretty serious about-face from just two years ago when Motorola released the $750 Moto Z2 Force, especially when you consider that the most expensive phone Motorola makes now is the $500 Moto Z4.However, even with Motorola’s more modest ambitions, the company still hopes to deliver on a mid-range device with more premium aspirations. Compared to our current favorite budget phone—the $300 Moto G7—the Moto Z4 offers some significant upgrades including a 6.39-inch OLED screen, some high-megapixel cameras in front and back, the biggest battery Motorola has ever put in a Z-series phone, and of course, the return of the all-important headphone jack. Hell, the Z4 even has an in-display fingerprint reader which up til now, was a feature found almost exclusively on high-end handsetsAll told the Z4 ticks a lot of boxes and avoids any major flaws (aside from one potentially frustrating feature), and yet even though I kind of like the phone, I’m having a hard time feeling much more than that. But let’s start with the good stuff.For a $500 phone, the Moto Z4’s OLED screen looks great. Colors appear rich, and with a peak brightness just shy of 600 nits (589 nits to be exact), the Z4’s luminance is on the same level as many flagship devices. And while the Z4 does have a notch, it’s about as unobtrusive as a notch can be, and considering any current solution that would allow for an all-screen display would easily push the Z4’s price north of $500, I’m not bothered. And because the Z4’s bezels are slimmer than what you get on Pixel 3a or 3a XL, you get more usable screen area, because while the phones are approximately the same size, the Pixel 3a XL’s screen tops out at 6 inches. Inside, the Z4 comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That last part is a big deal because it’s double what you get from a Pixel 3a, and that’s before you tack any additional storage via the phone’s microSD card slot—a feature the Pixel 3 doesn’t have.Despite its Snapdragon 675 chip being a couple steps down from the Snapdragon 855 processor you find in a lot of high-end phones, the Z4 still feels quite snappy, particularly if most of your time is spent browsing the web or checking social media. On WebXPRT 2015, which evaluates web browsing performance, the Z4’s score of 258 was just 10 percent lower than the LG G8’s score of 284 (though the Galaxy S10's score was much higher at 361). The only time the Z4’s performance was ever really an issue was when playing more demanding games like PUBG Mobile or Auto Chess, where you tend to run into a big of lag depending on game settings.Motorola even managed to cram stereo speakers on the Z4, and while audio quality is just OK, it beats the mono speakers you often find on phones in this price range. And then there’s the Z4’s headphone jack, which has finally returned after nearly four years when Motorola axed the jack on the original Moto Z. The simple fact that Motorola finally relented under the pressure of consumer complaints is kind of shocking, and in a world where companies rarely bring back features after killing them off the first time, some might even say it’s courageous. Either way, it’s a welcome return. I also have to give a special shout out to Motorola for giving the Z4 a 3,600 mAh battery (the biggest battery ever in a Moto Z phone), as it let the Z4 last 13 hours and 49 minutes on our battery test. That’s an hour longer than the Pixel 3a XL (12:43) and two hours longer than the regular Pixel 3a (11:51), though the OnePlus 6T still tops them all with a time of 14:37.As for the Z4’s cameras, Motorola gave the phone high-resolution shooters on both sides with a 25-MP selfie cam up front, and a 48-MP camera in the back. Both cameras use a technique called pixel binning, which combines four adjacent into one big pixel to deliver better low light sensitivity. Strangely, while there is a setting you can adjust to get the selfie cam’s full 25-MP instead of the effective 6-MP pics it takes by default, there doesn’t seem to be an option to shoot full 48-MP shots with the rear cam. In normal conditions, the Z4 has very little difficulty snapping Insta-worthy pics with bright colors and sharp focus, though when compared to pics from a Pixel 3a, you’ll notice that the Pixel has an edge in detail. A good example of this difference is the extra level of detail you can see on the bricks on the New York Public Library in the Pixel 3a’s shot below. And in another shot of a nearby street mural, the Z4’s shot appears overexposed and lacks the same level of detail, contrast, and dynamic range as what I got from the Pixel 3a.When nighttime rolls around, Motorola also gave the Moto Z4 Night Vision mode, because nowadays, every phone basically needs to have a special low-light shooting mode. Unfortunately, while the Z4’s Night Vision does a decent job of turning up the brightness when it’s dark, using Night Vision also tends to result in a loss of sharpness, something you can see in both the shot of an outdoor restaurant taken at night, and the shot of a croquette taken indoors with the lights turned down. I like that Moto stepped up to give customers more tools to deal with challenging low-light shots, but considering the Pixel 3a basically has the same camera as its more expensive sibling, it’s tough to beat what remains the best smartphone camera in this price range.Finally, we come to the Z4’s frustrating features. Even as a fan of in-display fingerprint sensors, the one you get on the Z4 can be a bit of a headache. Out of all the phones I’ve tried with similar tech, the optical fingerprint reader buried underneath the Z4’s screen is the least reliable. Sometimes it works perfectly fine, while other times it takes three or four taps to unlock the thing, with fingerprint recognition appearing to struggle slightly more when used outside in super bright environments. And there’s the Z4’s modularity. Even after Motorola’s three-year commitment, the Z4 still has a strip of pogo pins on its back that lets you connect one of Motorola’s 16 or so attachments. With the Z4’s retail price $100 more than a Pixel 3a (or $20 more than a Pixel 3a XL), it sort of feels like you need to at least have one mod in mind to extract the Z4’s full value. But out of Motorola entire list of mods, there’s only two or three that I like: the Moto GamePad, the JBL SoundBoost 2, and maybe the Polaroid Insta-Share Printer (assuming shareable retro photos are your kind of thing). That’s about it.At $200, the Moto Insta-Share Printer and Hasselblad camera mod are too expensive to love, and even back when it was released, the Hasselblad mod’s pictures always looked a bit soft. You’re much better off sticking with the Z4’s primary camera unless you want that extra zoom. And while at one point there was a wireless charging shell for Motorola’s Z phones, that seems to have gone out of production.The one possible exception is the Moto 5G mod. But not because of what it can do now, but potentially what it could do in the future. Based on the current state of 5G deployment, there’s very little reason for 99.9 percent of people to buy a 5G phone in 2019. But in a year or two when 5G coverage becomes much more widespread, the ability to add 5G capability to the Z4 for $200 could save you the expense of having to buy a whole new phone. But that’s a big “could” because right now, the 5G Moto mod only works on Verizon, and there’s no word if or when other carriers might put out their own 5G mod. On top of that, only Moto Z4s purchased through Verizon will have support for the 5G mod at launch. Motorola is planning on adding that capability to unlocked Z4s in the future, but haven’t said when that will happen yet.But the most challenging thing the Z4 has to contend with are the other phones on either end of its price bracket. Even without competition from affordable Chinese handsets like the Xiaomi Mi 9, Nubia Red Magic 3 and others, for my money, I still prefer the $400 Pixel 3a or OnePlus 6T over the Moto Z4. The Pixel 3a costs less, has a better camera, and true stock Android 9 instead of Moto’s near stock implementation, while the OnePlus 6T looks better, lasts longer, and has way better performance. I like the Moto Z4, and if one of its mods catches your eye, you might too. But at this point, I wonder if after four years of support for its mod platform, maybe it’s time for a reboot or a new approach to add some extra excitement to Moto’s Z-series phones. "
47,Oneplus 7 pro,https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-7-pro-review-stunning-all-screen-design-thats-1834738811,"For years, OnePlus has been nipping at the heels of smartphone giants like Samsung and Huawei with stripped down phones boasting big specs, solid designs, and not much else. And for a lot of people that was totally fine, as it allowed OnePlus to offer up top-notch performance for hundreds less than its competition.But on the OnePlus 7 Pro, we’re looking at a whole new equilibrium. Starting at $670, not only is the OnePlus 7 Pro easily the most expensive OnePlus phone yet, but it’s also the most luxurious. Between new features like a pop-up selfie cam, a stunning display without any notches or cutouts, triple rear cameras, and that higher price tag, the whole David vs. Goliath narrative of OnePlus trying to take down other flagships doesn’t really hold up anymore. So is the price hike worth it, after OnePlus worked so hard to carve out its place in the mid-range?In short, yes. Absolutely. While OnePlus has moved up in price, the rise of baby flagships like the Galaxy S10e, iPhone XR, Honor View 20, and others have emerged to create a new $700 battleground to fight over. This is a war to win over people who remember the days of when high-end phones cost closer to $600 or $650 rather than $1,000, but also for people who simply don’t want to drop that much dough on a phone. And out of all of its similarly priced competitors, the OnePlus 7 Pro is the handset I’d throw my money down on.From the moment you see it, the OnePlus 7 Pro dazzles. In front, it has a huge 6.7-inch 3120 x 1440 display supplied by Samsung, that in addition to blasting out rich, vibrant colors, has also been tweaked to support a 90Hz refresh rate. This makes the OnePlus 7 Pro’s screen one of the smoothest looking displays on the market. Now, just doing mundane things like scrolling through menus or flipping between apps are small joys, as you watch things flick past your eyes in pure, fluid motion.But then, as your eyes get accustomed to all that, you realize the OnePlus 7 Pro doesn’t have any notches, punch holes, or other distractions to take away from that lovely display. This feeling is almost enough to transport you into the future to a time when no phones have cutouts anymore, and it makes you wonder why anyone ever put up with anything less. OP 7 pro’s screen even has a stronger blue light filter to really cut down on sleep-preventing rays messing with your head at night. All told, the OnePlus 7 Pro’s screen is so good, it alone nearly justifies the $100 bump in price compared to the OnePlus 6T. But of course, OnePlus didn’t stop there.Wedged just above the display is a thin sliver of an earpiece, which works in tandem with the phone’s bottom-mounted speaker to deliver true stereo sound, something no OnePlus phone has ever had before. OnePlus also upped its already-speedy 22.5-watt Dash Charge power adapter to 30-watts, and then changed its name to Warp Charge to drive home the point. We’re talking about the ability to bring the phone from dead to 50 percent in just 15 to 20 minutes. And with a big 4,000 mAh power pack and battery life that lasted 13 hours and 36 minutes in our rundown test (15 minutes longer than the Galaxy S10e’s time of 13:20), it feels like you’re never more than a heartbeat away from having enough juice to last the rest of the day.That said, I find OnePlus’ refusal to add wireless charging to the OnePlus 7 Pro downright infuriating. On previous phones, the extra cost needed to add wireless charging made that decision somewhat understandable. Meanwhile, OnePlus says the even the speeds of today’s fastest wireless chargers still fall short of its wired Warp Charge brick, and they are right. But wireless charging has never really been about speed, it’s about convenience, and on a phone priced around $700 with the word “Pro” in its name, wireless charging is something I still think the OnePlus 7 Pro should have. If it did, this phone would be damn near untouchable in this price range.I’m less bothered by the OnePlus 7 Pro not having an official IP rating for water and dust-resistance. OnePlus claims the OP7 Pro should be more than fine if it gets hit with some rain or even a splash or two. I just wish they would do a better job of explaining how good its water-resistance really is, and maybe even backing that up in its warranty. I also have to give a shout out to the blue version of the OnePlus 7 Pro (which the company calls Nebula Blue). Its glass back uses multiple layers that absorb light in different ways, giving the phone a frosted appearance that sucks you in like an icy black hole. So even though Huawei still has the best selection of colorways in the smartphone world, the OnePlus 7 Pro in blue is the singular most enchanting color option so far this year.  OnePlus didn’t skimp on the little things and addresses complaints about its previous phones by equipping the OP7 Pro with a beefier vibration motor. The phone adds a handy built-in screen recorder so you can natively save videos of whatever you’re doing on your phone, a feature Google still hasn’t added to stock Android. OnePlus  increased the size and speed of the phone’s in-screen optical fingerprint reader, so there’s practically no difference between it and the  captive touch sensors found on last-gen phonesIn back, the OnePlus 7 Pro now sports triple cameras with its primary sensor boasting a whopping 48-MP resolution in addition to a 16-MP ultra-wide angle camera and an 8-MP telephoto cam with a 3x zoom. This setup adds a whole new dimension to the OP7 Pro’s photo toolkit, which is great for all those times you don’t want to drag a big camera around. However, compared to big dogs like the Pixel 3, Galaxy S10 and S10e (which has the same cameras as the S10 minus the third telephoto cam), OnePlus still can’t deliver the same kind of image quality you get from the big smartphone giants.In a side-by-side food shot comparison, I found that the OnePlus 7 Pro fell a bit short on sharpness, contrast, and color saturation to both the Pixel 3 and Galaxy S10. It’s not something to be mad about considering the latter two phones’ higher price tags, but the difference is there, even if you might not be able to see it when people upload their pics to Instagram.The more significant issue for the OnePlus 7 is when it comes to low light. Without its Nightscape mode turned on, photos taken in darker environments come out looking soft and grainy compared to its flagship competition. This is one of those situations where Samsung’s and Google’s expertise with HDR and AI photo tuning comes into play.That said, thanks to OnePlus’ Nightscape mode, the OP7 Pro can catch up a bit in certain scenarios, and it nearly matched what I got from a Pixel 3 when I shot a tough nighttime cityscape. Sometimes, it even seemed like OnePlus’ Nightscape mode was a tiny bit too good at increasing the brightness of low-light photos, as evidenced by a pic of some local graffiti that borders on being blown out despite being shot at night.I also really like the OP7 Pro’s 3x telephoto lens, as it gives you more reach than anything aside from the Huawei P30 Pro. Its 3x optical magnification feels like a nice sweet spot for smartphone zooms, and with a bit less resolution to work with, photos still came out looking quite crisp.However, when it comes to selfies, longtime OnePlus fans may take issue with the OP7 Pro’s pop-up cam, not because it shoots a bad picture (it doesn’t), but because it feels like the biggest departure from OnePlus’ previous “essentials only” philosophy. But that camera is part of making the phone’s all-screen display work, and if you’re someone like me who typically refrains from shooting too many selfies, I think it’s a smart compromise.And if you prefer using face recognition instead of your finger to unlock your phone, that still works too, and when it’s enabled, you get the treat of seeing and hearing that small motorized camera pop its head up every time you want to get into your phone. The whole process is a bit slower than something like Apple’s Face ID but not annoyingly so. OnePlus even installed a tricky feature that automatically retracts the pop-up camera anytime the phone detects that it’s falling. (You can see this in action by extending the pop-up camera and then throwing the phone in the air, but don’t cry to me if you drop it.) At the same time, OnePlus claims that selfie camera should survive at least 300,000 cycles, which translates to about 150 uses a day for five years. For a lot of people, this pop-up cam might be a dealbreaker, but for how it improves the screen by eliminating the need for a notch, I think it’s worth it. Finally, as you’d come to expect on a OnePlus phone, the OP7 Pro delivers excellent performance thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and support for snappy UFS 3.0 storage, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of base storage. And if that’s not enough, there are more well-equipped configs with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $700, and one with a 12GB of RAM for $750. OnePlus even added a liquid cooling system to keep performance as consistent as possible, along with a new RAM Boost mode for all the gamers out there. I’m just a bit bummed that the only way to get the blue model is to upgrade to the 8GB/256GB model.Dollar for dollar, the OnePlus 7 Pro is easily one of the best smartphone values available right now, which is downright impressive considering this phone has a richer list of features and specs than anything OnePlus has ever made before. The only other phone that even comes close is the new Pixel 3a, which manages to deliver the same fantastic camera experience as the regular Pixel 3, but with a price that starts at just $400. But when I  think about the OnePlus 7 Pro’s beautiful all-screen display, its triple rear cams, and stylish new design, there are a lot of things that keep pulling me back in. For the OnePlus 7 Pro, instead of trying to be a flagship killer, OnePlus took a different tack, aimed right at the new segment of baby flagships, and beat the big boys at their own game."
48,Pixel 3a,https://gizmodo.com/the-400-google-pixel-3a-completely-redefines-great-ban-1834573047,"Last year, the Pixel 3 proved that it’s possible to use software to create a thoughtful phone that’s just as powerful, and sometimes easier to use than competitors crammed full of the latest high-end components. But for a phone that started at $800, it would have been nice to get a few extra bonus features like reverse wireless charging or an extra camera or two in back. With the Pixel 3a, Google has crammed all the nifty pixel software and AI-enhanced features into a phone that costs half the price. And in the process,  Google made the best value phone on the market.With the Pixel 3a starting at just $400 (or $480 for the Pixel 3a XL), the first thing you wonder about is what kind of sacrifices Google had to make to get the price that low. From the outside, those differences are hard to spot, as the Pixel 3a retains the Pixel 3's trademark design, right down to the phone’s two-tone back, brightly colored power button, and soft-touch finish. It’s really only after you hold the 3a and a regular Pixel 3 side-by-side that you notice that it’s constructed out of polycarbonate (plastic) instead of glass, which gives it an ever-so-slightly warmer, less slippery feel, along with a little less heft as well. Meanwhile, for the Pixel 3a XL (which is what I tested for this review), the big difference between Google’s new mid-range handset and a standard Pixel 3 XL is the lack of a notch. In its place, the Pixel 3a XL features larger bezels around its 6-inch display (instead of 6.3-inches on the Pixel 3 XL). Google also moved one of the Pixel 3's front-facing speakers to the bottom of the phone, which gives the 3a XL a bit of a chin, but thankfully, that new bottom-mounted speaker has been paired with the earpiece up top so that the phone still delivers stereo sound. On the Pixel 3a XL, Google also cut the phone’s resolution from the Pixel 3 XL’s 2960 x 1440 down to 2160 x 1080, which means if you look closely, you will notice a small reduction in the sharpness of text and photos. But that’s really nitpicking, and since the Pixel 3a screen still features an OLED display, it doesn’t lack any of the rich and vibrant colors we got on the original Pixel 3's screen. As for its guts, the biggest change for the Pixel 3a is the use of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 processor as opposed to a Snapdragon 845 chip, but once again, unless you’re really trying to stress the system, it’s hard to pick out any big dips in everyday performance. If you look closely, occasionally you’ll see a tiny bit of stutter or lag when flipping between apps or scrolling through menus, while games like PUBG Mobile don’t run quite as smoothly as they might on a phone with a beefier chip. On a $400 phone, these kinds of hiccups are pretty inoffensive. The Pixel 3a’s 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage are  in line with what you’d expect from a handset in this price range. And when it comes to battery life, the 3,000 mAh battery in the Pixel 3a lasted an admirable 11 hours and 51 minutes on our video rundown test, while the 3,700 mAh hour battery in the Pixel 3a XL fared even better at 12:43. For the Pixel 3a, that’s half an hour longer than what we got from a regular Pixel 3 XL (11:24), and almost a full hour for the Pixel 3a XL. Critically, Google hasn’t messed with the Pixel 3a’s rear camera, which features the same camera sensor and optics found on a standard Pixel 3. However, you do lose out on the secondary wide-angle selfie cam found on the front of a standard Pixel 3. And while the 3a doesn’t have Google’s dedicated Pixel Visual Core chip to help handle image processing, Google customized the 3a’s photo pipeline to ensure that the 3a won’t lose out in a head-to-head shoot out against a regular Pixel 3. That’s a pretty big claim, but after comparing a number of photos shot by both phones, Google totally delivered. A $400 phone has never had a camera this good.Across almost every situation and environment, the Pixel 3a produced the same color rich HDR+ pics I got from a standard Pixel 3, while also retaining all of the Pixel 3's special shooting modes such as Super Res Zoom, Photo Booth mode (which now has a cute new kiss detection feature), and most importantly, Night Sight. Google even added a new Timelapse feature to the Pixel 3a (which is also heading to older Pixel phones) that lets you turn long recordings into significantly shorter clips with options for 5x, 10x, 30x or even 120x speeds.To test this out, I used the Timelapse mode to capture the fading light from sunset as it washed over some nearby mountains and fields, condensing a five-minute clip into a short 15-second movie. Creating the timelapse couldn’t have been simpler, all I had to do was select the speed of the timelapse and then hit record. Now to be clear, timelapse modes on phones aren’t exactly a groundbreaking feature, but the final clip is crisp and smooth, with the only thing distracting from the sped up movement of the clouds being the cloud of insects that show up as little black dots that dart across the frame. My big regret is really that I wish I had had more time to grab a longer recording. For stock Android fans who still long for Google’s old Nexus phones, your champion is here. With a plastic back, a built-in headphone jack, and pure Android experience, the Pixel 3a feels like the true spiritual successor to the Nexus 5. The only thing you don’t get is a removable battery, which is something almost no phones have anymore. My only real concern about the Pixel 3a is whether it will suffer from the same sort of quality control issues and bugs that plagued the early days of the Pixel 3. Not only does the $400 Pixel 3a fill a big gap in the budget/mid-range market, I’d argue that anyone who was previously thinking about getting a $300 Moto G7 should seriously consider spending a bit more for a Pixel 3a. And while the Pixel 3a doesn’t have the pure compute power to match something like the OnePlus 6T, between Google’s HDR+ photography, the availability of day one updates and bonuses like Duplex and unlimited picture storage in Google Photos, the Pixel 3a might be an even better value that’s also friendlier to use. In the end, while Google made a handful of compromises to create the Pixel 3a, every change makes sense and feels thoughtfully considered. When you factor in the Pixel 3a’s much more affordable price tag, all those trade-offs are totally worth it. For a $400 phone, the Pixel 3a is a triumph. It looks like a Pixel, it feels like a Pixel, and it damn sure snaps pics like a Pixel."
49,HuaweiP30 pro,https://gizmodo.com/huawei-rewrote-the-rules-for-smartphone-cameras-with-th-1834494431,"Despite how you might feel about its rumored ties to the Chinese government (or lack thereof), Huawei has undeniably made some of the most technologically advanced phones of the last three years. Huawei released the first handset with triple rear cameras and reverse wireless charging, while also beating its biggest rivals Apple and Samsung to the market with phones featuring in-screen fingerprint sensors and dedicated neural processing units. But for Huawei’s latest flagship phone—the P30 Pro—Huawei was faced with a difficult challenge. Traditionally, Huawei P-series phones have pushed camera innovation. But after leveraging AI to help tune camera settings and putting three cameras on the back of its phones, what else was there left to improve? Sure, Huawei could have kept increasing the number of cameras on its phone like we’ve seen on the Nokia 9, but in some ways, that feels a bit too obvious. So instead, Huawei chose to completely re-engineer the way camera sensors work to achieve better low-light performance. Then Huawei tacked on an unprecedented 5x optical zoom lens just for kicks.You see, inside almost every modern digital camera, there’s an image sensor with a Bayer filter, featuring a repeating four pixel grid that uses two green pixels, one red pixel, and one blue pixel to capture light and color. It’s a fundamental system employed by practically every camera company not named FujiFilm, but it’s not perfect. For the P30 Pro, Huawei changed up the formula by replacing the green color filters in a Bayer filter with yellow ones, with the reasoning being that yellow is a lighter color than green, which allows more light to pass through the filter and hit the sensor behind it. More light means brighter images, which when you’re out and about snapping pics in low light is precisely what you want.However, while that might sound like a simple switch, it’s really an enormous amount of work. Once you change the way a camera’s color filter functions, you need to redesign its image processor (the thing that interprets the data the camera’s sensor captures), how those images are shown on a display, all of the camera’s various photo modes, and a bunch of other stuff. So has all of Huawei’s effort paid off?Actually, yeah. With its new sensor, the P30 Pro on auto mode can more or less match the excellent low light capabilities of Google’s Night Sight processing, without any extra tuning or special settings. That also means less hassle too, because now you don’t have to pause and hold the camera steady for four or five seconds as you do for with most dedicated Night Modes. Just tap the shutter, try not to shake your hands for a beat, and that’s it. When you compare shots from the P30 Pro to phones like the Galaxy S10 or Pixel 3, the difference is obvious. For example, in a nighttime shot at a nearby park, while a photo captured by the Galaxy S10+ looks alright because the S10 needed to set the shutter speed at 1/9th of a second, even with the phone’s optical image stabilization, objects in the S10's pic appear significantly blurrier. Meanwhile, a face-off between the P30 Pro on auto and the Pixel 3 without Night Sight turned on shows how much of a head start Huawei’s new sensor really provides. If I didn’t know better, someone could have easily fooled me by saying the P30 Pro’s shot of this scooter on auto mode was taken on a sunny afternoon, and not almost midnight, which is when I snapped the pic. And even after I enabled Night Sight on the Pixel 3, the P30 Pro’s picture still featured sharper details and captured an image that looked more accurate to what I saw with my eyes. While the Pixel 3’s Night Sight mode did a good job of removing the heavy color cast that came from nearby streetlights, the P30 Pro’s photo is superior in almost every other way. Of course, Huawei has its own dedicated Night Mode as well, which adds an extra level of detail to challenging low light shots. Though I found that because the P30 Pro’s auto mode was so good, I didn’t feel the need to use it nearly as much, compared to the Pixel 3, which basically necessitates the use of Night Sight when the lights go down. That said, Huawei’s new sensor isn’t perfect, because while it has dramatically improved the P30's Pro’s low-light performance, it seems to have slightly negatively impacted the P30's Pro’s bright light shooting. When compared to both the Galaxy S10 and Pixel 3, a daytime shot of some flowers from the P30 Pro had way more blown out highlights and more muted colors in the surrounding greenery. I suspect this is something Huawei can improve over time, as this could be an effect of Huawei having to re-design its camera stack to accommodate that new sensor, but at least right now, there is a trade-off. Also, I should mention that Huawei only uses its custom RYYB sensor on the main camera, not the P30 Pro’s 20-MP ultra-wide camera or its 8-MP telephoto cam. It’s an understandable move, though it can be a bit jarring when switching between lenses, especially if you’re shooting video. Now, if the only thing Huawei had done was upgrade the P30 Pro’s main camera sensor, that would have been enough. But it didn’t, because for the P30 Pro’s telephoto camera, Huawei added a new system with a 5x optical zoom, what Huawei claims is a 10x lossless zoom, and a bonkers digital zoom that goes all the way up to a 50x magnification. This level of magnification blows past competing phones, which for the past few years, have been stuck with 2x or 3x zooms. The problem for phones is that unlike a normal camera lenses, there’s almost no room to fit all the glass and optics needed to deliver a really long zoom. So to solve the problem, Huawei installed a mirror similar to a periscope to lets the phone bend light down into the phone’s body, which lets Huawei use the length of the P30 Pro to squeeze in optics, instead of its thickness. Frankly, this is a development I love, because until now, big camera zooms were something you only found on proper standalone cameras. But with the 5x/10x zoom on the P30 Pro, you get so much flexibility to get closer to the action. To test this out, I took the P30 Pro and some of its rivals to Madison Square Park and then tried to snap pics of the Empire State Building from almost 10 blocks away. And the results? Well, they speak for themselves.At 5x and 10x zoom, the P30 Pro delivered fantastically sharp images, though as you get closer to 50x, it starts suffering from the issues inherent with digital enhancement. But the real eye-opener is how much more reach the P30 Pro’s telephoto cam offers compared to the 2x zoom you get on a Galaxy S10+. It’s quite a shock.OK, enough about cameras, what’s the rest of the P30 Pro like to use? At this point, it shouldn’t be a surprise, but the P30 Pro is a premium device from top to bottom. The P30 Pro is stuffed with all sort of techy solutions such as both wireless and reverse wireless Qi charging, IP68 dust and water-resistance, 15-watt fast-charging (and reverse wired charging as well), and the best color options you can get from any smartphone maker today. The P30 Pro even has an IR blaster, which is a feature almost every other phone maker has dropped from their flagship devices.And with a seriously big 4,200 mAh battery, the P30 Pro offers ridiculous longevity. On our video rundown test, the P30 Pro lasted 15 hours and 24 minutes, the second longest runtime we’ve seen yet, behind only the Samsung Galaxy Fold’s time of 17:06.However, if I can nitpick a bit, I’m still frustrated that Huawei didn’t make room for a 3.5mm jack on the P30 Pro, as that’s a feature you do get on the vanilla P30. Aside from the unnecessary bloatware, Huawei’s EMUI 9.1 skin continues to be a relatively inoffensive take on Android, but at the same time, its somewhat cartoony look and occasionally overly simplistic UI is hard to love. And while the P30 Pro’s 6.5-inch OLED screen is impressively bright and colorful, it does suffer slightly from having less overall resolution than you get on a Galaxy S10. It’s not a dealbreaker, but with a screen that big on a phone that costs close to $1,000, if you have good eyesight, you can sometimes notice when text and images don’t look quite as sharp as they could.But the P30's real downside is that it’s not really officially supported in the U.S. While you can get an unlocked P30 Pro from third-party retailers like B&H for just $900 ($100 less than the most similarly equipped Galaxy S10+), the P30 Pro isn’t compatible with CDMA networks like Verizon and Sprint. And if you ever run into a situation where you need customer support, you can’t expect the same kind of care you might get from an Apple or Samsung device.But the impact of what Huawei has done on the P30 Pro is undeniable. If you frequently shoot photos in bars, restaurants, or similarly challenging environments, the P30 Pro’s low light capabilities are quite convincing. Meanwhile, that 5x optical zoom periscope breaks through to new levels of magnification for smartphone cameras. Also because some of the tech used in the P30 Pro’s zoom system comes from Corephotnics, a company recently acquired by Samsung for $155 million, you better believe that 5x zoom is something we’ll be seeing on a lot more phones in the future. For the P30 Pro, Huawei set out to push the boundaries of smartphone photography, and on not one but two counts, it did."
50,Samsung Galaxy Fold,https://gizmodo.com/the-samsung-galaxy-fold-is-a-flawed-start-to-something-1834238492,"In a lot of ways, doing a traditional review of the $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Fold is pointless. Anyone who buys one isn’t doing so because it’s a good value or a sound purchasing decision. It’s not. They’re buying one because it’s new,  innovative, and exciting. Besides, pre-orders for the Galaxy Fold have already sold out, so even if you want one, it’s probably too late. And yet, for a product with many flaws, even in its current state, the Galaxy Fold presents a vision that makes a ton of sense, and it’s one of only a handful of gadgets that you can call a game changer and mean it.The Fold is truly an outrageous gadget. Weighing in at 9.3 ounces and measuring just over 17 millimeters thick, the Galaxy Fold is almost twice as heavy and more than double the thickness of a standard Galaxy S10.Sure, it might fit in your pocket, but you’re never going to forget it’s there, and if your pants are loose or you forgot to wear a belt, you’re going to be at risk of randomly dropping trou throughout the day. You can’t stash the Fold in a breast pocket either without looking like you’re trying to smuggle a bar of gold out of Fort Knox.But the real sticking point for most people is Fold’s $2,000 price tag. For the same money, you could almost buy four OnePlus 6Ts, a phone that can generally do the same stuff the Galaxy Fold can. Or you could buy everyone in a family of five plus weird Uncle Jerry their own Nintendo Switch, and still have some cash left over.On the flip side, the Galaxy Fold is a spec monster boasting six cameras, 12GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and two displays: a 4.6-inch “cover screen” on the outside, and a flexible 7.3-inch screen on the inside. Compare that to an iPhone XS Max which has a screen that tops out at just 6.5-inches and costs $1,450 when kitted out with the same 512GB of storage. Suddenly, the Galaxy Fold’s price doesn’t seem quite as preposterous. And that’s before you consider the Fold comes with a pair of Galaxy Buds and a Kevlar-like case included. Then there’s the Fold’s 4,380 mAh battery that delivers incredible longevity on a charge: Using its big folding screen, on our video rundown test, the Galaxy Fold lasted 17 hours and 6 minutes, which is the longest runtime we’ve ever seen on a phone.Aside from all the trouble people have wrapping their heads around Galaxy Fold’s price, the other main question I get about the Galaxy Fold is: What the hell are you supposed to do with a screen that big? It’s a fair question, especially considering apps like Twitter, Instagram, and others don’t function any differently on the Fold than they do on other phones. Things just look bigger, similar to what you’d get if you were using a tablet. Phrased like that, the screen’s an underwhelming gimmick.But if you’ll allow me to generalize for a bit, you know who loves tablets? Grandparents. For them, the bigger screen makes it easier to tap icons and read text, while the ability to fold the thing in half means you can take the Fold places a tablet might not usually go. Forget that abstraction, though, because that’s not what I love about the Galaxy Fold. To me, the Fold’s big, bendy screen means it can consolidate multiple devices into a single gadget. It’s tech simplification at its finest.Instead of using a tablet to read comic books, the Galaxy Fold delivers an experience that’s just as good or maybe better. Same goes for ebooks. By installing the Kindle app and setting the background color to black, I can turn the Fold into a high-quality reading device. That’s two entire devices I no longer have to worry about again. How’s that for savings?That big screen is useful for everyday stuff too, whether it’s watching videos on the train, looking for nearby attractions in Google Maps, or playing mobile games like PUBG or Auto Chess. With that much real estate, getting a wider view of all your units is more engaging, and hitting headshots is legitimately easier too. And if you like watching stuff while you work out, the Galaxy Fold’s screen is nearly as big and a lot damn sharper than any screen built into an exercise machine not made by Peloton.When you put all of these functions together and then add the ability to multitask by having three or more apps all open at once, while other handsets have tried in the past, the Galaxy Fold feels like the first real phone for power users.The way the Fold goes about all of this is also pretty slick. Using what Samsung calls App Continuity, the Fold can switch seamlessly between apps on the cover screen and apps on the inside display. Just flick the Fold open, and that’s it. Not every single app works perfectly, but Samsung has worked with Google to make sure all the first-party Samsung apps and essential Google apps work as expected. And despite full support for flexible screens built into Android (which isn’t scheduled to arrive until Android Q), even less popular apps usually don’t run into problems. One of the few exceptions to this is YouTube. Instead of being able to crop in to fill the screen or stick with the video’s native aspect ratio, YouTube videos almost always default to  16:9. In landscape, this leaves letterboxes at the top and bottom, which are fine, but not ideal. The bigger problem is that no matter which way you hold it, there will always be a cutout for the Galaxy Fold’s cameras. What makes this even stranger, is that this doesn’t happen in YouTube TV or other video players.Speaking of cameras, the Galaxy Fold’s six shooters are probably a bit much. I know why Samsung does it, as the cameras on the front and inside are mostly reserved for taking selfies and face unlock. But at the same time, I would be totally happy if there weren’t any cameras on the inside of the Fold at all—though with the sheer number of selfies people take nowadays, that’s probably not going to happen. At the very least, positioning the two inside cameras vertically (in portrait mode) instead of horizontally would let Samsung hide the cameras inside the letterboxed portion of the screen. As for the Fold’s triple rear cameras, they appear to be the same sensors and optics you get on a standard S10. There’s a 12-MP primary lens, a 12-MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 16-MP ultra-wide angle lens. There are no real surprises here. All of them are quite sharp, but in a pure image quality face-off, Samsung’s cameras are still often edged out by what you can get from a Pixel 3. However, since the Fold has two extra lenses that the Pixel 3 can’t match, the comparison is basically even.By almost any metric, the Galaxy Fold’s early days have been troubled. Samsung should have told reviewers not to peel off the Fold’s polymer layer. The Galaxy Fold box reviewers received is different from standard retail packaging, which contains explicit instructions not to go digging your fingernails into the Fold’s delicate gadgetry. Regardless, you can’t go back in time, so those stumbles are things Samsung has to live with. To Samsung’s credit, the company recently issued a statement saying it’s delaying the Galaxy Fold’s launch to address early concerns about the phone’s durability. The first thing most people point out about the Galaxy Fold is its crease. You can see it, you can feel it, and it can be distracting, but after using the Fold almost non-stop for a week, the crease is really just the Fold’s fourth or fifth biggest problem.To me, the Fold’s greatest shortcoming is the size of its 4.6-inch cover screen. It’s just too small. It’s fine for quickly scrolling through texts or emails, but the second you start typing a reply, the frustration begins. Due to the cover screen’s extra tall aspect ratio, there’s not much room for a keyboard, which makes things feel exceedingly cramped. Furthermore, when you think back on how much work Samsung has done to eliminate bezels on previous Galaxy phones, the cover screen appears even more awkward. With that much-wasted space around the outside, the cover screen looks like a guy wearing a t-shirt three sizes too small. Then there are the obvious concerns about the Fold’s durability. Samsung says its flexible screen should be able to handle thousands of bends, but the real answer right now is that we just don’t know. One reviewer encountered issues after something got stuck under the Fold’s screen and caused the display to malfunction, while at least one other Fold bugged out for seemingly no reason. That said, even though our review unit is a European model, the Fold has functioned without issue since we received it, and that includes surviving a two-foot fall onto hardwood without a case. Still, considering the Galaxy Fold’s price, any bugs or defects feel even worse than they might on a regularly priced device.I also have questions about a potential point of weakness on the Galaxy Fold: the intersections at the top and bottom of the flexible screen where the display meets the hinge. There’s a small gap that seems like a possible vector where the Fold might collect small debris that could eventually cause some damage. Or maybe I’m just overly cautious. Once again, we don’t know.There’s also the Fold’s overall weight and thickness. It’s manageable, but not ideal. It’s something Samsung will almost assuredly improve in future generations, but if anyone said the Fold’s size was a deal breaker right now, it’s completely understandable. The Fold’s flexible screen is still a work in progress too. Samsung’s flexible displays don’t quite live up to the industry-leading screens found on other phones equipped with Samsung display. The Fold’s screen is without a doubt bright and vibrant, but with a 2,152 by 1,536 resolution that has to span 7.3 inches of screen, the Galaxy Fold’s pixel density is almost 30-percent lower than what you get on an S10+. That means if you pixel peep, you can sometimes see text that doesn’t look as sharp as it would on a typical high-end phone.The Fold also suffers from a slight wobble or unevenness while scrolling, where the left side the screen moves just barely ahead of the right side. It’s very subtle and something most people probably wouldn’t notice unless it was pointed out to them, but it’s there.All told, Samsung has work to do for the second-gen Fold. As daunting as they may sound, none of these problems stopped me from enjoying the hell out of the Fold. It’s thick, but it also feels substantial. The magnets hidden inside the screens deliver a reassuring snap every time you close the phone, while that big screen makes everything on it more enjoyable. In almost all every scenario, the answer is no. Are you someone searching for an affordable phone? Then don’t buy the Galaxy Fold. Do you want something durable? Don’t buy the Fold. (Unlike the IP68 rating for water and dust resistance that’s become standard on almost every flagship handset, the Galaxy Fold has nothing.) Do you not see the point of having a huge screen on a phone? The Galaxy Fold is not for you. Do you hate reading instructions, researching a device, or testing out something experimental? Then definitely don’t get the Galaxy Fold. The Galaxy Fold is undoubtedly an impressive piece of tech, but it hasn’t been perfected, and to expect immaculate performance out the gate is a bit unrealistic. If the Galaxy Fold doesn’t interest you, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. Don’t buy one. This might sound damning, but that’s the way things go for revolutionary gadgets. The original iPhone opened eyes and minds, but the iPhone 3G was actually the one you wanted to buy. It was a similar situation for the first Surface. The blueprint for an entirely new class of laptop was there, but the keyboard and the OS didn’t really feel complete until the Surface Pro 3. And that’s probably how it will go for the Galaxy Fold.If you’re intrigued by the idea of a big bendy screen that still fits in a pocket or clutch but are scared of first-gen tech, just wait. In a couple of years when the Galaxy Fold 2 or 3 comes out, many of Samsung’s growing pains could be distant memories. Right now, the Galaxy Fold is for people who can handle some rough edges in exchange for trying out a gadget that’s unlike anything else on the market. With a price this high and ambitions this big, a lot of people are positioning the Galaxy Fold as the phone of tomorrow. But that’s only partially correct. The Galaxy Fold isn’t the future, it’s just one branch of it. The Galaxy Fold can coexist with traditional phones, it’s not a bendy screen assassin, at least not yet. However, despite all of its caveats, there’s one thing I found telling. Anytime I had to put the Fold down to run a test or perform some other hands-off activity, more than any other phone in recent memory, I couldn’t wait to ditch my daily driver so that I could use the Galaxy Fold again. The Galaxy Fold won’t strike everyone the same way, but for the people who get it, it hits really hard. The Galaxy Fold is a device that’s hard to appreciate until it’s actually in your hands, and while Samsung has work to do, even this early,  folding is believing. "
51,LG G8,https://gizmodo.com/lg-g8-review-sleek-in-the-streets-wannabe-tech-wizard-1833906996,"It’s been a while since I’ve used a phone with such wildly different personalities living in the same device, but here were are. On the outside, the LG G8 features a fantastically sleek and minimalist design as good or better than other phones on the market. But on the inside, the G8 dreams of being a technological wizard, combining high-end specs and components with some truly out there features that even LG’s biggest rivals don’t have. It’s a story of a model with futuristic good looks, but with the mind of a mad scientist. And while the former tends to win out, I can’t help but appreciate the latter’s ambition.The word sleek doesn’t even really do the G8 justice. From its subtly rounded sides where glass gives way to metal with just the slightest suggestion of a seam, to its completely flush cameras in back, the G8 feels polished and refined in a way that makes phones with camera bumps look like unfinished prototypes. There’s practically not a single sharp edge on the entire device, with the biggest things breaking up the G8's silky facade being the buttons on either side of the device. In a lot of ways, the G8's design reminds me of the Essential Phone’s chassis, which I mean as a compliment, as that was the best thing about that entire device.But LG didn’t stop there, because to drive home the G8's minimalist vibes, LG got rid of the G8's earpiece and replaced it with something the company is calling Crystal Sound tech. Basically, that means instead of a tiny speaker up top, the G8 uses piezoelectric motors that vibrate the phone’s lovely 6.1-inch OLED screen, essentially turning the display itself into a speaker. It’s a neat trick that makes audio seem to emanate from the top half of the phone (both front and back), while a standard speaker on the bottom of the device helps out to deliver full stereo audio.While it sounds a bit silly, it works and even produces a lot of volume. That said, the G8's audio does tend to sound a bit flat, although considering the kind of sound that comes out of most smartphone speakers, it’s hard to get real worked up about that. The G8's Crystal Sound tech also comes with a side bonus that when talking on the phone normally with the device pressed up against the side of your face, the vibrating screen functions similarly to bone-conducting headphones. You might have to move the phone around a bit to get that aspect of Crystal Sound’s abilities to work right for you, but In loud or crowded environments, that means hearing someone on the other end of the line while using the G8 can be a bit easier compared to other phones. Now I know making and receiving calls is no longer the primary role of smartphones, but for people who do talk on their phones a lot, it’s a nice little extra.And unlike some of its other competition, the G8 doesn’t include a punch-hole selfie cam or an in-display fingerprint reader, which is honestly kind of refreshing. Instead, you get a notch up top (which can be masked to hide the cutout if you like), and a fingerprint sensor on the back. Simple and easy. Meanwhile on the inside, the G8 sports Android 9, a blazing fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip, and 6GB of RAM, with LG also doubling the phone’s base storage for 2019 to 128GB. LG also didn’t skimp on what are quickly becoming legacy extras either, which means you get a microSD card slot for extra storage and a headphone jack.The G8's battery life is also praiseworthy, as it lasted 12 hours and 21 minutes in our video rundown test. While that is about an hour short of the Galaxy S10's time of 13:21, it would still take some serious effort to drain the G8 in less than a day, and it’s a huge step up from the dismal 9:05 we saw on last year’s G7. All told, between its design, battery life, and core components, there’s no doubt the G8 offers a premium experience.It’s a similar situation for the G8's cameras. In bright light, there are only small differences between the G8 and other flagship devices like the Galaxy S10 or Pixel 3. Sometimes, if you’re pixel peeping, you’ll notice that a shot from a Pixel 3 will contain a tiny bit more detail, while in others, there will be some differences in white balance, but that’s about it.In low-light though, that gap widens a bit, because even though the G8 has its own version of Night Sight called Night View mode, it’s not nearly as powerful as Google’s solution. The one added benefit to LG’s Night View is that unlike Night Sight, it offers a slider tool that lets you adjust how strong its low-light processing gets. However, even when I turned the slider up to 75 percent and took two shots back-to-back (one with Night View on, and one with it off), it’s clear the G8's low-light magic has a lower ceiling.In back, the G8 can also shoot portrait style videos in addition to regular portrait photos, including the power to adjust the depth of field mid-recording. But in my experience, the effect was often hit or miss. Sometimes backgrounds would look soft and blurry as you’d expect, while other times, it seemed like the effect didn’t work at all.To me, the biggest shortcoming of the G8 photo taking capabilities is actually that it only comes with two cameras in the back instead of three. Triple rear cameras are quickly becoming a standard feature for flagship phones. Huawei and Samsung are already doing this, and it’s looking like Apple will hop on the triple camera trend later this year.But what’s really annoying is that LG knows this too, since LG also put three rear cams on a phone last year with the LG V40. That puts the G8 in a bit of an awkward position, because while the G-series is still one of LG’s tentpole phones, it feels like it’s been forced to take a backseat to LG’s V-series handsets, which has eked out a slightly higher position within LG’s smartphone hierarchy.OK, now we come to the G8's wizardly features: its built-in palm recognition and Air Motion gesture controls. Both features are powered by LG’s “Z Camera,” which uses a 3D time-of-flight depth camera to do things like read the blood vessels in your hand, or track gestures you make in the air in front of the phone.The G8's palm recognition is relatively straightforward. You just hold our your hand above the phone’s front-facing camera, and the phone unlocks. Unfortunately, the speed of the G8's palm unlock even when it detects things correctly on the first try (which isn’t always the case), is still slower than face recognition and fingerprint recognition (both standalone and in-display readers). And if you take into account the relatively limited area where the phone can properly read your palm, even a numeric passcode or swipe pattern is typically faster as well.Then there are LG’s Air Motion Gestures. With them, you can dangle your hand in front or above the phone and open apps by sliding your hand left or right, capture screenshots by pinching your fingers together, adjust the volume of music or movies by twisting your hand left and right, and more. Unfortunately, the learning curve is quite steep, because even after nearly of week of using it, activating the feature and completing tasks never felt entirely smooth.But the bigger problem is that while you can customize Air Motion to open any two apps of your choice, that’s not enough. For me, I found the best use of Air Motion to be when I was sitting at my desk with the G8 facing me, propped up on a wireless charger. Positioned that way, I could somewhat easily open a music app, adjust volume, and play a song all without actually touching the phone. But what I really wanted to do was open the notification tray, snooze or dismiss alerts, and scroll through websites, all of which are beyond Air Motion at the moment.I don’t want to harp on these features too much, because it’s first-gen tech and LG says it’s looking to refine and improve its gesture recognition abilities in the future. Though at this point, some people might call out that Samsung tried something like this before with Air Gestures on the Galaxy S4, a feature Samsung quickly abandoned on later Galaxy devices. But like Air Gestures, Air Motion isn’t a failure because the idea is bad, it’s more because the tech and its possible uses still aren’t mature enough. In both cases, it’s a situation of an interesting concept with incomplete execution. Right now, Air Motion doesn’t add a ton of value to the G8, but given a little time, if Air Motion could be expanded into a more comprehensive control scheme that lets you full manipulate device without actually needing to touch it, suddenly the idea doesn’t seem too silly.However, I can’t but help wonder how much cheaper the G8 could have been had LG skipped its tricky Z Camera altogether. Because its palm recognition hasn’t been perfected, it feels like the G8 is crying out for a “Lite” version that offers the same specs and general design, but with the Z Camera stripped out to help reduce the phone’s price even more. To make matters worse, the G8's pricing is kind of all over the place, with T-Mobile offering the phone for as little as $620, while Verizon, AT&T, and Sprint have the phone’s full price listed between $820 and $840. (At launch, some carriers seem to be dangling a $200 rebate with some possible fine print trickery to help knock down that price, while T-Mobile is essentially eating the rebate and dropping the list price of the phone by $200.)In the $800 range, the G8 has a hard time matching up with the Pixel 3 or the Galaxy S10 feature for feature. But if you knock $200 off, it’s another story. Given the choice between a $620 G8 and even a $750 Galaxy S10e, I’d have a hard time shelling out an extra $130 for Samsung’s alternative. At that price, the G8 also becomes a welcome upgrade to something like the $580 OnePlus 6T. In a world where the G8 is the device that sits on the high side of the mid-range market, I like it a lot. But when it tries to take on more sophisticated devices closer to the $1,000 mark, despite its good looks, the G8's oddball antics don’t give it enough to compete."
52,Sony Xperia 10,https://gizmodo.com/sony-xperia-10-review-my-adventure-with-an-extremely-l-1833843807,"Smartphones screens have been getting taller (or wider depending on how you hold them) for a little while now. But Sony has taken that idea to a whole new level with these lanky devices: the Xperia 10 and Xperia 10 Plus (not to mention the forthcoming Xperia 1). Priced at $350 and $430, the new Xperia 10 duo represents Sony’s latest entry into the budget and mid-range market, and while Sony’s extra long 21:9 screens might only seem like a small step up from the 18:9 or 19:9 displays found on other handsets, it seriously impacts the way you actually use the device. Here’s is my attempt to embrace the lank.The first big thing you notice about the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus is the way they handle. Those long and narrow screens give both models— but especially the standard Xperia 10—a feeling very similar to small phones like the iPhone SE or previous Xperia Compacts, but without sacrificing on screen size. Compared to something like the Moto G7 with its 19:9 display, it’s almost like trying to make one of those tomato roses with a paring or chef’s knife, while with other phones, all you get is a machete.On top of that, Sony slimmed down the Xperia bezels so that you only get a thin strip of glass and metal surrounding three sides of the device, countered by a sizeable forehead up top for the phones’ 8-MP selfie cams. However, because of the Xperia 10's lengthy dimensions, a new problem arises in that suddenly, it’s not so easy to reach the top of the screen so you can see your notifications.Thankfully Sony does offer a solution with its included Side Sense bar, which is a little tab that lives on the left or right side of the screen (or both if you want), that can be doubled tapped to pull up a list of commonly used apps, a few quick settings icons, and dedicated buttons to activate one-handed mode or pull down the notification tray. That means there’s no need to fumble and stretch your hand to the far corners of the phone’s screen. However, I wish Sony had taken a lesson from Samsung and LG phones, which make phones that allow you to pull down the notification tray by swiping down on the phones fingerprint sensor.That’s because with a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, anytime you’re holding an Xperia 10, at least one finger sort of naturally rests in that area, which would have made it easy to check in on any recent calls or messages with a simple swipe. That said, there’s a potentially bigger issue when it comes to what’s going on above and below that side-mounted finger reader.On the Xperia 10, the lock button and the volume rocker sit nearly flush against the side of the phone. It makes searching for the phone’s controls by touch more difficult than I’d like, and while I did get used to them after a while, there’s a longer-than-normal period of adjustment.However, by far the best thing about the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus’ 6-inch and 6.5-inch screens is the way they let you watch true widescreen content without any cropping or letterboxes. While it’s true most content on the web is still 16:9, there’s actually a surprising number of titles, particularly movies, on streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime video available with full 21:9 playback. And while this won’t happen every time you pull up a video, when things are all working together, I can see appeal of pushing screens to their lanky limits. Sony is even working with game makers to add support for 21:9 screens, though since only one game—Marvel Strike Force— has made that move, it’s a non-starter right now.As you’d expect from their extra-wide screens, the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus can record video in 21:9 as well. It’s a nice nod to synergy, but that capability is muted somewhat due to the Xperia 10's overall image quality, which isn’t much better than what you get from the Moto G7, which is an issue considering the G7 costs $50 to $130 less.In bright light, the Xperia 10 typically matched shots from the Moto G7. However, further testing revealed an issue with the Xperia 10's white balance when shooting in sunny conditions that caused pictures to look overly yellow, as if a light sepia-toned vintage filter had been applied. What’s stranger is that this effect only occurred on the Xperia 10, not the 10 Plus, and while there is a color temperature slider built into Sony’s camera app that can help fix this issue, you shouldn’t need to do that at all. I’ve reached out to Sony about the issue, and I will post an update when we hear back.In other situations, the Xperia 10 showed much better low-light photography compared to the Moto G7, and if you’re someone who tends to snap a lot of pics at night or in bars or restaurants, the Xperia 10's low-light image quality represents its biggest advantage over the Moto G7. Meanwhile, on the Xperia 10 Plus, Sony includes a secondary 2x zoom lens that works as intended to give the phone a little extra reach. It’s a nice bonus, and something not found on the G7, but that’s about it.When it comes to performance, the standard Xperia 10 suffers a bit due to its Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor. In Geekbench 4, the Xperia 10 (4,049) scored almost 20 percent lower than the Xperia 10 Plus (4,945) and its Snapdragon 636 CPU, and nearly 15 percent worse than the Moto G7 (4,624). While that might not sound like a huge difference, it’s something you can feel during everyday use, particularly if you rapidly switch between a lot of apps or play more resource hungry games.And to make matters worse, both the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus don’t have very good battery lives. On our video rundown test, the Xperia 10 lasted 8 hours and 39 minutes, while the Xperia 10 Plus only fared slightly better at 9 hours and 18 minutes. Critically, both of those times are worse than the Moto G7's time of 9:29, which again, is troublesome considering that the G7 is cheaper than both.All this leaves me feeling somewhat disappointed. While I initially thought their lanky screens were a gimmick, they ended up being a draw that kept bringing me back. Not only does the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus’ sleek dimensions make them great to hold, Sony’s metallic chassis reminded me how nice it is to have a phone that features something besides glass on the back. And with an easily removable SIM tray featuring a microSD card slot, a handy headphone jack up top, and stereo speakers on the Xperia 10 Plus, Sony’s latest low-cost handsets come pretty well equipped. The Xperia 10s even feature a nice, clean build of Android 9 too, so there’s no bloat or stupid gunk to worry about.But with higher price tags, lackluster performance for the Xperia 10, and subpar battery life for both, the Moto G7 remains the much better value. This sort of relegates the Xperia 10 Plus to serving as a mid-range alternative mostly for people who want better low-light photography, while the standard Xperia 10 gets left out in the cold. Though with some sites like Best Buy offering up to $100 on the Xperia 10 (with immediate activation), assuming you can snag a deal, I wouldn’t write either off completely, just so long as you don’t pay full price. But after getting to know and appreciate this lanky screen duo, I was just hoping for more."
53,Moto g7,https://gizmodo.com/the-moto-g7-is-so-close-to-budget-perfection-1833663097,"For years Motorola has had a stranglehold on the budget phone market, especially in the U.S where phone buyers don’t have quite the same access to all the low-cost handsets available overseas. It’s gotten to the point where it’s as if you could just change the headline on previous reviews, update a few numbers and specs and call it a day.Now no one is going to do that, it would be lazy, but the sentiment still rings true. And after spending some time with the Moto G7, while I do wish Motorola added just one more feature to make its latest $300 just a bit more exciting, the G7 still feels like one of the best values of any phone on the market.For 2019, it seems Motorola’s idea was simply to give the G7 more of everything. At 6.2-inches, the G7's LCD has gotten a sizable increase from the 5.7-inch display featured on last year’s G6. The screen is bright too, able to hit nearly 600 nits on our tests, which makes images look rich and vivid even viewed outdoors. And by moving the phone’s fingerprint to the back of the device while also slimming down its bezels, the G7's screen to body ratio got a nice bump to just short of 82 percent.Same goes for its components, because in addition to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chip, Motorola also increased the phone’s RAM from 3GB to 4GB, while doubling its base storage to 64GB. That’s the same amount of storage you get from an iPhone XS, a phone that costs more than three times the price of the Moto G7. And when it comes to performance, even though the G7 isn’t a mobile gaming powerhouse, unless you’re a big-time PUBG Mobile or Fortnite fanatic, the G7 has enough power to handle most gaming or multitasking duties without much lag.Thankfully, Motorola didn’t get rid of any important ports either, which means you still get a USB-C port for data and charging, a microSD card slot for expandable storage, and a 3.5mm jack for anyone who hasn’t embraced the Bluetooth headphone trend.Holding everything together is the same glass-paneled front and back that you get on every other phone nowadays. However, despite the G7 being a tenth of an inch wider and taller than last year’s model, because it’s still relatively light and a tiny bit thinner than before, the phone never feels cumbersome even in my smallish hands. There is one design choice that feels a bit pedestrian though: that notch. Between the tiny hole for the 8-MP selfie cam and the relatively thick hump surrounding it, the top of the G7 kind of reminds me of a cyclops with a unibrow wearing eyeliner. While I wouldn’t call it offensive, it’s not exactly an endearing look either.On our unlocked review unit, the G7 also sports a wonderfully lightweight build of Android 9 Pie, with practically zero extraneous software and only a light touch from Motorola for things like its Moto Actions. That means you get still support for Motorola’s long-standing gesture controls, which let you hold the phone while making a chopping motion to activate the flashlight, twist the phone with your wrist to launch the camera, or even use the side-mounted volume controls to change tracks when the screen is off. I also have to give a shout out to Moto’s One Button Nav, which in my opinion, is a slightly better implementation of gesture controls than the standard “pill-button” nav in stock Android 9, mostly because it’s smaller and performs all of the standard Android navigation features with a single button. (However, if you prefer Android’s three-button nav bar, that’s still an option as well.)Around back, Motorola included a familiar dual camera module consisting of a 12-MP main camera and a secondary 5-MP depth sensor that assists with things like portrait shots. In bright light, the Moto G7 is an even better shooter than the slightly more expensive $350 Sony Xperia 10, particularly when it comes to accurate white balance and preserving details in highlights. One of the starkest differences came in a head-to-head shoot-off of a statue of Honest Abe in the late afternoon, where the Moto G7 captured an image that was better exposed, colorful, and avoided the awful yellow color cast that plagued the Xperia 10's shot. (Check out the slideshow below.)In low-light, the competition was a lot closer, with the Moto G7 suffering from excess noise in certain shots, and a general lack of sharpness in others. It’s a real shame because it feels like the G7's low-light photography hasn’t improved much since last year, and all things considered, it’s the one real knock I have against the phone as a whole.Motorola also gave the G7 some fun extra camera modes like Spot Color, which lets you preserve a single color in the shot while turning everything else to black and white, and a built-in cinemagraph mode that lets you turn videos into quick, eternally looping gifs. And while neither mode nails the effect 100 percent, both are more than capable of delivering a bit of quick fun.There is one area Motorola didn’t go bigger on the G7: its battery. Featuring a 3,000 mAh power pack that’s the same size as what you got in the Moto G6, the G7 doesn’t offer much in the way of increased longevity. On our battery rundown test, the G7 lasted just 9 hours and 29 minutes, which is an hour and a half short of our 2018 battery life average. And while that figure includes times from some premium, high-end phones, it still feels like Moto could have done a little better.For people who want longer battery life and better low-light photography, I can’t fault you for wanting to reach for more. But when you consider everything the Moto G7 offers for $300, it’s hard not to appreciate how it fares against similarly priced competition, not to mention how much value it packs compared to today’s $1,000 handsets.Sure, a Galaxy S10 or iPhone XS will give you a better overall experience, but are those phones more than three times as good as the Moto G7? That’s a much closer call. Either way, the Moto G7 is a success because it doesn’t make you feel bad about buying a budget phone. I just wish Motorola had given the G7 something unique to make the phone feel a bit more distinguished."
54,Samsung Galaxy S10 e,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-cheaper-smaller-just-righ-1833149084,"It wasn’t long ago when premium smartphones cost around $700. But after suffering through several release cycles littered with $1,000 flagships, it’s clear those days aren’t coming back. To fill in the gap, phone makers have started putting out streamlined, slightly more affordable versions of the flagship devices, typically with a handful of more luxurious features removed to help lower the price.Apple hopped on the trend with the iPhone XR, while several other big handset producers have put out “Lite” or “Fit” versions of phones like the Mate 20 and LG G7. Now, Samsung is giving its hand a try at making a cheaper flagship with the $750 S10e, and when compared to similar phones, it might be the best stripped down flagship yet.The main differences between the S10e and the standard S10 are a smaller 5.8-inch screen with a slightly lower 2280 x 1080 resolution (compared to a 6.1 or 6.4-inch screen for the S10 and S10+, with a 3040 x 1440 resolution), the lack of an in-screen fingerprint sensor, and just two rear cameras (wide and ultra-wide) instead of the triple rear camera module on the S10 featuring a 2x telephoto lens not found on the S10e.But the more important part is that unlike the iPhone XR, which Apple gave an LCD screen instead of the OLED panel found on the iPhone XS and XS Max, the S10E has the same dynamic AMOLED screen tech found on the S10 and S10+, which means you get the same super vibrant colors and blue-light reducing filters too.The S10e also features the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of base storage found on the S10 and S10+, which is a welcome inclusion, as that means you won’t suffer any speed or performance reductions just by choosing the least expensive S10 model. The S10e also comes with a microSD card slot in case you want to add extra storage, but if you prefer paying extra for more on-board storage, the highest you can go is a version with 256GB of internal storage for $850, as opposed to the S10 and S10+, which can be configured with up to 512GB or 1TB of storage, respectively.The biggest departure for the S10e is its lack of an in-screen fingerprint reader. Instead, the S10e sports a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that’s built into its power button, rather than the rear-mounted sensors Samsung used on the Galaxy S8 and S9.Aside from the split in features, there are a couple of other minor nuances that don’t show up on specs sheets. The first being the shape of the S10e’s flat screen. In back, the S10e sports the same curvy glass Samsung has used on past Galaxy devices, but in front, the S10e’s display doesn’t have the rounded edges that Samsung has used on every Galaxy since the S7 (or S6 Edge depending on how you’re counting). This one change has several effects. While you still get Samsung’s Apps Edge tab for managing icons and contacts, the flat screen features less distortion around the outside of the display. And because the S10e’s screen doesn’t have tapered edges, its body sports a boxier shape and a more substantial feeling frame. So for anyone who has spent the last few years hating on Samsung’s curvy screens, your champion is here.Another less noticeable change on the S10e is its vibration motor. Even with the S10e’s vibration slider pushed to the max, haptic feedback from the S10e only feels about half as strong as the S10+. For many, this might not be a big deal, but it’s something to consider. Also, despite not having a second selfie cam in front like you get on the Galaxy S10+, the S10e can still shoot wide-angle selfie and portrait mode shots, with the latter being the product of simulated depth-of-field effects instead of through hardware.The final difference to be aware of is that while the S10e sports a smaller 3,100 mAh battery than both the S10 and S10+, its actual battery life is still quite respectable. In our video rundown test, the S10e lasted 13 hours and 20 minutes, which is better than every phone we tested last year aside from the Mate 20 (15:15) and Mate 20 Pro (14:06), and the OnePlus 6T (14:37). However, that time is still a bit short of the Galaxy S10's time of 15:09.Honestly, aside from having one less camera to play around with, the S10e doesn’t feel short-changed compared the standard S10 and S10+. Its display still looks stunning, its performance is excellent and feels noticeably faster than any other Android phone, and its cameras are still excellent though the Pixel 3 does have a slight lead when it comes to pure image quality. I wish Samsung had opted to include the 2x telephoto lens instead of the ultra-wide angle lens, as I find that having that extra reach is often more useful than having a wider field of view, though that’s more of a personal preference.And for people who simply favor smaller phones, the S10e is the natural choice. Not only is it generally easier to use one-handed, the S10e’s thicker metal sides make it feel a bit beefier, and potentially slightly better suited to living a life case-free.The main difference in usability comes down to where you touch the phone when you want to unlock it. But in a lot of ways, in-screen fingerprint readers are a perfect example of a luxury feature. The ultrasonic sensor built-into the S10's screen doesn’t unlock any faster, and might even be a touch slower than the side-mounted capacitive sensor on the S10e, so really its just a matter of becoming accustomed to one location over the other. And unlike some side-mounted fingerprint sensors like the one on the Razer Phone 2, Samsung gave the S10e a small indent that makes it easier to locate the power button by feel alone.For anyone even slightly concerned about blowing their budget, the S10e is the easy choice. It delivers nearly the same premium smartphone experience you get on the standard S10, but for $150 less (or $250 in the case of the S10+). The only real reason to upgrade is if you are the sort of person who lives on their phone, and would get more use out of a larger screen and bigger battery. But in terms of pure value, the S10e is not only the best deal out of the new Galaxy S10 trio, it also puts other “affordable” flagships to shame. Even when compared to the standard Pixel 3, which still costs $800, the $750 S10e offers a compelling way to save $50 while still getting a super premium handset.With the S10e, you don’t have to compromise on display quality, performance, or build, which is something you can’t quite say about the iPhone XR. I just sort of wish we didn’t live in a world where $750 is merely the bottom of the price range for a modern flagship smartphone."
55,Samsung S10,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-an-android-champ-to-get-exci-1833080698,"If the Pixel 3 was Google’s crowning achievement for showing how good a software-first approach to phone design can be, then the Galaxy S10 is a tribute to the hardware gods. Between a new take on the tired notched selfie cam, a redesigned rear camera setup with three different lenses, and incredible battery life, the Galaxy S10 feels like a celebration of smartphone tech sophistication.It’s impressive how much Samsung crammed inside Galaxy S10, particularly the S10+. Despite having practically the same-sized 6.4-inch screen as the Galaxy Note 9, the S10+ sports a slightly larger 4,100 mAh battery (versus 4,000 mAh for the Note 9), an extra camera sensor in front and back, and reverse wireless charging (Samsung calls this wireless power share) in a body that’s actually 10 percent thinner. Now, I’m not someone who typically cares about the difference between 7.8 and 8.8 millimeters, but when they’re in your hand, you definitely notice. For a phone packing this many new features, at 6.1 ounces, the S10+ is surprisingly light too.Everything about the S10's aesthetics is on point. Samsung’s new Infinity-O punch-hole selfie cameras are a sleeker, less distracting version of last year’s notches. Samsung also tweaked the aluminum chassis that holds the phone together, so that it’s more comfortable to grip. Even Samsung’s prismatic color options live up to their name, especially the prismatic white colorway, which shifts from electric purple to hot pink to pale blue depending on the light. And since Samsung replaced the rear fingerprint with an ultrasonic scanner buried beneath the display, there are fewer distracting features around back.The most attractive thing about the S10 is its screen. For 2019, Samsung is calling the S10's screen a dynamic AMOLED display, a component that the screen testing experts at DisplayMate gave their highest grade yet. And while all those numbers and ratings are important, simply looking at the stunningly brilliant colors the S10's screen puts out is proof enough, the S10's display is the best on the market. It supports HDR10+ content, with a display that can push at over 1,200 nits in certain circumstances, as well as HDR10+ video recording. Combine that with top-notch photo capture, and the S10 has the uncanny ability to make all your homegrown content pop on screen better than anything the iPhone XS or Pixel 3 can manage.In some ways, it’s a subversive trick, because it tends to make content appear more vibrant when viewed on the S10's screen than it might appear on other devices. On the flipside, the S10's screen also features improved blue light filters, which do a better job of cutting down on the slice of colors that can help make it harder to fall asleep.To avoid the notch, Samsung had to eliminate the iris recognition sensors used on the past two generations of Galaxy phones. You can still unlock the phone with your face if you want, but to authenticate more sensitive actions like online payments, you’ll need to rely on the S10's in-screen ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, which Samsung claims is the world’s first FIDO-certified biometric sensor.This is a trade I’m willing to make, as I prefer a more deliberate touch of a finger to confirm a purchase, as opposed to something like Face ID. And with the speed and reliability of the S10's in-screen sensor, there’s essentially no downside. Really, the only time the S10's ultrasonic scanner ever missed was when I tried to unlock the phone while its screen was completely off and didn’t have the little fingerprint icon to tell you where to touch. But that’s an issue that resolved itself after about a day of getting used to the phone, and now I kinda prefer the stealthy nature of being able to unlock the S10 without needing any overt cues.As for those new rear cameras, Samsung added an ultra-wide lens to the S10's toolkit. It’s a move we’ve seen before on the LG V40 and Huawei Mate 20, and it cements triple rear cameras as something every high-end phone should have. All three are quite sharp, although the ultra-wide angle does suffer from slight distortion around the edges, owing to its 123-degree field of view. But the real impact of that wide-angle lens is how it supplements the other two cams, because now with three cameras of varying focal lengths, the S10 is better equipped than before to handle any picturesque moment life throws at you.A great example of this happened while I was in Barcelona for MWC. While I was on the way to what seemed like an endless number of phone launches, I was able to step aside for just a minute to take three shots of the palatial Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya using all three lenses. In less than 10 seconds, I had close-up details of the museum from afar, a shot that captured the view as I saw it, and a third pic that captured the expansive surroundings. That’s a series of shots Google and Apple’s best phones can’t capture right now, and it highlights how an extra sensor that might seem superfluous can record a tranquil moment, even amidst an otherwise hectic schedule.That said, if image quality is the only thing you care about, in certain situations, the S10's cameras fall short of what the Pixel 3 can deliver. In a side-by-side shootout between the S10+, Pixel 3, and iPhone XS Max, the Pixel 3 did the best job of capturing details on the crane in the background and the texture of the road in front. And unlike the iPhone XS, neither the S10+ nor Pixel 3 went overboard on the blue light seeping through the fountain in the center.Samsung also updated the phone’s scene optimizer, which intelligently detects various objects and environments to help optimize camera settings. Now, the S10 can recognize the difference between a cat and a dog, a shoe and a car, or automatically turn on the phone’s Bright Night setting in very dark situations. The issue for the S10 is that unless the phone detects these things on its own, you can’t activate those photo tweaks yourself. This poses a problem for Bright Night mode, because even in low-light situations, unless it’s really dark, you won’t get any help.Often, that’s not a huge deal, because, with the main cam featuring a max aperture of f/1.5, the S10 naturally gathers more light than the f/1.8 aperture rear cam on the Pixel 3. But when I set up a candlelit shot to test this out, while the S10 outperformed the Pixel 3 without any special modes turned on, I couldn’t do a direct comparison between Samsung’s Bright Night mode and Google’s Night Sight feature until I moved my one candle to the opposite side of the room. So after getting everything situated again, I tried once more and found that with Bright Night and Night Mode activated, well, let’s just say that Google’s Night Sight is the real deal.Even though Night Sight has been out for six months, and its effects shouldn’t surprise me anymore, Google’s computational photography still finds ways to amaze. And now that Samsung has upgraded to triple rear cams, it feels like the biggest way it can improve photography on future Galaxy phones is to step up its image processing even more. Though all three of the S10's cameras are solid, there’s still a little room for improvement.Packing a Qualcomm 855 chipset, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage standard, the S10 posted benchmarks 15 to 25 percent higher than even the fastest last-gen Android handsets. That bump might not be something everyone notices on its own, but working in tandem with Samsung’s One UI skin for Android 9, the S10 feels significantly speeder and more responsive than the S9. One UI also includes handy interface improvements that make buttons and icons easier to reach one-handed and useful additions like pop-up notifications that produce little bubbles on the phone’s home screen when someone sends you a text.Finally, I’d be messing up big time if I didn’t mention how stupidly good, the S10’s battery life is. On our rundown test, the standard Galaxy S10 lasted 14 hours and 45 minutes, while the S10+ lasted 15 hours and 9 minutes. Seriously. That’s even better than the 14:09 we got from the Galaxy Note 9, and way longer than the Pixel 3's time of 10:50. In the real world, the S10’s longevity is even more profound. During MWC, I used the S10+ as my main device, and between constantly using the phone to check Slack, looking up directions, shooting photos, checking notes and everything else I need to do, covering trade shows is one of the most taxing roles I could ask a phone to perform.But even with all that, the S10+ lasted almost two full days on a single charge. After hitting 60 percent before falling asleep on the first day, the S10 finally conked out at about 10:30 the next night. Sure, it wasn’t a full 48 hours, but with even without any special battery saving modes turned on, going a night without plugging in isn’t the death sentence that it used to be. Unless you are intentionally trying to kill the phone, single day battery simply feels like its no longer a concern. No more carrying two phones, a charging case, or extra battery packs. The S10's battery life gives you freedom.So what are you supposed to with all that extra juice? Well, make sure all your other gadgets are topped off, of course. While the S10's wireless PowerShare feature transfers juice at around 5-watts (or slightly higher depending on the device being charged), which is sort of the bare minimum for wireless charging speeds, the feature is more about utility than recharging things as fast as possible. It’s perfect for helping out a friend’s less energetic handset, but wireless PowerShare’s best use might be as a substitute wireless charging pad while traveling. With it, you don’t need to bring the cradle for the Galaxy Watch or other smartwatch with Qi support when you leave home for a couple of days. Flip the phone over, tap the PowerShare icon in the quick settings menu, and that’s it. Just remember that when it’s not plugged in, wireless PowerShare won’t work if the phone has less than 30 percent battery left.I was hard on Samsung at the end of last year, but with good reason. As good as the S9 is, as the world’s biggest smartphone producer, I felt like Samsung could do even better. And with the Galaxy S10, Samsung has delivered. Even when compared to the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the Galaxy S10 has a better screen, sharper cameras, slicker design, and even longer battery life—all without needing to sacrifice the phone’s headphone jack.The biggest thing stopping anyone from picking up the S10 is price, because starting at $900 for the regular S10, that’s a lot of money to throw down on a phone. But when you compare that to the Pixel 3 which hasn’t gotten a price drop and still costs $800 for less sophisticated hardware, and the $1,000 iPhone XS, the Galaxy S10 comes the closest to making all those dollars worth it.Update 3/11/19: Added battery life results for the standard Galaxy S10.

56,Honor View 20,https://gizmodo.com/this-gorgeous-punch-hole-phone-will-fool-you-into-think-1832361323,"Late last year, Samsung put an end to the notch era with the Galaxy A8S. Sadly, that device is currently only available in Asia, which largely puts it out of reach for people living on this side of the Pacific. But just recently, Honor followed up Samsung’s phone with its own punch-hole wielding bezel-less handset. And after spending some time with the new $650 View 20, it feels like Honor has come up with a sanely-priced phone that performs as good as it looks.Now before we get to the View 20's features, I need to give some props to the phone’s aesthetics. Between Honor and its parent company Huawei, the View 20 joins the Mate 20 Pro and a number of P-series phones as one of the most striking devices on the market. Which makes sense. As we’ve noted before, carriers have been discouraged by the US government to work with Huawei over numerous allegations of espionage, fraud, and theft. So the company has to make phones pretty enough that you’ll want to buy them regardless of Huawei’s press.In front, its 25-MP punch-hole selfie makes it the second phone in the world to sport this feature, while in back there’s a mesmerizing V-shaped hologram that dances in the light. It’s the kind of visual flair that compels nearly every person that sees it to stop, gawk, and eventually comment on it.Honor says the effect is born from nanolithography in a process similar to what’s used on a lot of credit cards but claims the View 20 is the first time the technique has been applied to a phone. Elsewhere, the View 20's general size (6.18 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches) and curvy glass back make it feel a lot like a Galaxy S9+, though because the View 20 features smaller bezels, the phone’s screen is just a touch larger at 6.4-inches (versus 6.3-inches for the S9+).As for the screen itself, the punch hole for the 25-MP selfie cam feels ever so slightly less intrusive than a notch, probably because of its placement in the top left corner, and if it really bugs you, there’s still an option to mask the punchout with a black border. I’m not going to say the hole punch screens are a true revolution, but for such a simple evolution, it does feel like a step in the right direction.The View 20's display also features vibrant, sometimes eye-searing colors that make the icons in Honor’s Magic UI 2 look a little cartoony, but since the phone’s theme and color profile can be easily customized, there’s not much to get worked up about. The phone also offers sufficient brightness of around 500 nits, though because it’s an LCD panel, you don’t get the same kind of contrast or black levels like you would on a more expensive OLED phone.The View 20's third and final standout feature is its 48-MP rear camera. It’s based on Sony’s IMX 586 sensor, and frankly, it’s sharp as hell. Without going too in-depth about Bayer filters and pixel grids, what makes the View 20's adaptation so nice is that depending on what you need, the View 20 can switch between shooting standard 12-MP pics, or full on 48-MP shots just by enabling the phone’s AI Ultra Clarity mode. While the latter has some limitations like requiring a decent amount of light and a preference for more sedentary subjects, it’s really nice having the option to extract max res from the camera sensor on demand.More generally, the Honor View 20's camera delights with shots that are well exposed (if sometimes bordering on being slightly overexposed). Low light images, even when taken with night mode turned off, sometimes look better than similar shots from a Pixel 3—the de facto low light camera leader. The main View 20 camera quirk to watch out for is Honor’s AI photo tuning, which can go overboard on color saturation when shooting pictures of things like food, flowers or certain landscapes.To the right of the View 20's main camera, there’s a second sensor module that, in addition to helping out with various depth-of-field effects, also features a stereo 3D time-of-flight camera. That means the View 20 has to power to more accurately gauge how far away various objects are away from the phone. Yet while that sounds pretty neat, in practice, actual applications of the phone’s 3D camera are much more limited.Back at CES, Honor demoed the View 20's ability to use the 3D camera as a way to play games, so you can use your whole body to control a skiing game, or play Fruit Ninja with your arms instead of relying on touch controls. The whole effect is similar to what developers can do with an Xbox Kinect, though just like the Kinect, there aren’t a lot of titles that can actually take advantage of the feature, and to even use it, you kind of need a stand to prop up the View 20 just right.Aside from games, the View 20 uses its time-of-flight sensor to more accurately identify food, measure their size, and come up with an expected calorie count, which in my experience worked reasonably well on simple things like fruit or even a number of baked goods. But on trickier things, the phone was much more hit-or-miss. Regardless, if I was really trying to lose weight, I wouldn’t rely solely on the View 20 anyways, that’s the beginning of gadget-based mind trap.You can also use the time-of-flight camera in conjunction with the phone’s beauty mode in order to more proportionally slim down your appearance in photos without needing to become an expert in Photoshop. Honor’s slimming function even worked on a cardboard cutout of everyone’s favorite wolf of Wall Street. Not even Leo is perfect.As for the rest of the phone, fans of wired audio will be enthused to know View 20 comes with a headphone jack. However, some of that excitement may be countered by the View 20's lack of wireless charging, it’s somewhat weak bottom-mounted mono speaker, and no official rating for water-resistance. Huawei says the View 20 should generally be immune to rain or a light splash or two. But if the handset takes a real dunk and dies, you won’t have anyone to complain to.At almost exactly 12 hours (12:01), the View 20 also offers some serious battery life. That said, I should mention that the average battery life of all the phones we tested in 2018 comes out to around 11 hours and 15 minutes, which suggests that phones with bad battery life are slowly becoming a less serious concern.In a lot of ways, the View 20 is stripped-down take on Huawei’s super premium Mate 20 Pro. It’s got the same Kirin 980 processor as the Mate 20, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 128GB of base storage, and styling as eye-catching as anything else on the market. But for the View 20, Honor removed luxury extras like reverse wireless charging, an in-screen fingerprint reader, and face recognition in order to bring the phone’s starting price down to 570 euros (or around 650 freedom bucks). That’s a combination good enough to give my favorite mid-range phone—the OnePlus 6T—some decent competition.Unfortunately, things aren’t all happy holograms and fancy front-facing cams for the View 20, because as with a handful of other Honor phones, even without diving into the ongoing security concerns regarding its parent company, there are a few caveats that need to be mentioned. Even though the View 20 is a good phone on paper, Honor hasn’t made an official commitment to bring the phone to the U.S., and even if it does, the phone will almost certainly be limited to GSM carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile.But if you do live in an area where the View 20 is an option, or you don’t mind buying one from an overseas retailer, the View 20 is a stunningly good-looking device and surprisingly sharp picture taker. And for a lot of people who don’t want to drop a grand on a phone that can still make peoples heads snap, that’s a pretty respectable formula.Runs Magic UI 2 based on Android 9 • Kirin 980 processor • 6GB/8GB of RAM • 128GB/256GB of storage • 6.4-inch 2310 x 1080 LCD touchscreen • 25-MP selfie cam • 48-MP rear cam • 4,000 mAh battery • USB-C 3.1 port • headphone jack • available in sapphire blue, phantom blue, phantom red, and black."
57,Asus ROG,https://gizmodo.com/asus-rog-phone-is-the-dumb-fun-rgb-handset-gamers-deser-1831204325,"A lot of people still aren’t convinced gaming phones are something that should even exist. But if there was one phone that might be able to sway peoples’ opinions, it’d be Asus’ Republic of Gamer (or ROG) Phone. In fact, based on some recent corporate shuffling, Asus is so emboldened by the ROG phone that the company is shifting its mobile strategy to focus even more on mobile gaming and high-end users. That’s an ambitious bet, but after playing around with ROG Phone, I have to admit there is a little sparkle to this mobile battle bus. Sure, the phone features an overly edgy design that caters to an increasingly played out gamer aesthetic. But on the ROG Phone, Asus goes so hard with all the gunmetal and orange, it’s honestly kind of impressive. In front, there are two stereo speakers adorned with shiny copper grilles, while around back, there’s a pseudo circuit board thing going complemented by another tangerine grille (this time for air circulation) and a hexagonal fingerprint reader and camera module. And to top everything off, Asus’ angry ROG logo is dead center and sports, you guessed it, customizable RGB lighting. Truly, this is a masterclass showcase of gamer design. *kisses fingers*But behind its aggressive facade, there’s actually a lot to like about the ROG Phone’s chassis. Down below, there’s a USB 3.1 Type-C port and a 3.5mm jack, but if you look around to the side, there’s a tiny silicone plug that hides two more USB-C ports. Actually, it’s more like one and a half USB-C ports, because if you look closely, you’ll see that one of the ports is colored orange. That’s your warning that it’s not meant to be used as normal, but only in tandem with Asus’ assortment of ROG Phone accessories (more on those later). However, that still leaves a second full USB-C at your disposal, which is something I wouldn’t mind seeing on more phones in general.And if you look even closer at the ROG Phone’s sides, you’ll see three small symbols (two on the right and one on the left) that are actually touch sensitive buttons that be customized for gaming. The way it works is that by going into the phone’s Game Genie settings (yes, that’s really what it’s called), you can drag little circles over a mobile game’s traditional on-screen controls and set them so that can be triggered by the ROG Phone’s touch-sensitive AirTriggers. While it’s not a perfect fix for on-screen buttons, it does instantly give you a better way to play titles like Fortnite or PUBG Mobile.Meanwhile, the ROG Phone’s UI sports a heavily themed look that apes its exterior design, with the Game Center app serving as your portal to control things like the phone’s rear RGB light, various game profiles, performance mode (Asus calls it X Mode), and more.You can even see the phone’s memory usage and the clock speed of your CPU and GPU, which might normally seem out of place on a mobile device. But on the ROG Phone, it makes perfect sense, because if you want speed, the ROG Phone has got it.Featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip (which Asus claims was specially selected to deliver optimal performance), 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (or 512GB if you upgrade), the ROG Phone is a mobile powerhouse. On Geekbench 4 and 3DMark, it delivered five to ten percent higher numbers on benchmarks compared to other flagship phones, and easily matched the kind of performance we saw from the Razer Phone 2. And while the ROG Phone’s vibrant 6-inch AMOLED display doesn’t offer the same 120Hz refresh rate found on Razer’s competitor, its color pop-more than the Razer’s LCD display, and Asus’ 90Hz screen (which is actually the refresh rate the Razer Phone 2 is set to out of the box) still makes games look a tiny bit smoother than normal.What might be even better than the ROG Phone’s horsepower is its battery life. Thanks to a big 4,000 mAh battery, the ROG Phone lasted 12 hours and 57 minutes our on rundown test, which puts it in the same range as the iPhone XS Max (13:07) and only about an hour behind the Galaxy Note 9 (14:11).Ok, so how bout those accessories? Well they are plentiful and quite varied, and are one of the ROG Phone’s main advantages over the Razer Phone 2. Included in the box, the ROG Phone comes with a nifty little fan add-on that attaches to the phone’s side-mounted USB-C port. Sadly, it’s ability to keep the phone cool is kind of hit or miss, but even when it isn’t properly moving air around, it also features a pass through USB port and an extra headphone jack. This means when you’re holding the phone in landscape mode—as you often do while gaming—the sides of the phone are clear of cords and cables.My favorite ROG Phone Accessory is probably the $230 Mobile Desktop Dock. Not only does it prop the phone up for use as a mini display, it also includes a ton of ports so you can hook the ROG Phone up to a mouse, keyboard, and an external monitor so you can game in style and with enhanced precision. Ain’t no one going to out snipe you again. And if $230 feels a little steep, there’s also a smaller Pro Dock that has a few less ports but does essentially the same thing.However, the one accessory that didn’t quite live up to expectations is Asus’ batshit $400 TwinView Dock. From the outside, it sort of looks like a controller add-on, but when you open it up, there’s actually a second 6-inch screen that connects to the ROG Phone. Sadly, even though it looks like it should, the TwinView Dock doesn’t turn the ROG Phone into a futuristic Nintendo DS, since almost no apps can actually use the second screen in a meaningful way. I was hoping that in games like PubG, you’d be able to use the lower screen as a control pad, leaving the top display clear for playing the actual game. But aside from a handful of titles, that’s not really possible. Basically, that means the best you can do is put two different games or videos on each screen, which sounds better in theory than it functions in real life. And because multitasking on Android is still somewhat limited, when you go to play one game, the other gets suspended. So you can’t even really play two games at the same time, no matter how hard you try.As a regular phone, one bright spot of Asus’ gaming handset is that thanks to the company’s experience making handsets, the ROG Phone is actually a pretty decent picture taker. In front, there’s a 8-MP selfie cam, while the back offers a 12-MP main camera with a 8-MP secondary shooter for snapping wide-angle pics. Compared to the Razer Phone 2, the ROG Phone generally captures slightly more detailed and vibrant photos. And in the one shot of some noodles where the ROG Phone’s came out slightly underexposed, Asus’ gaming phone suffered from way less noise and captured things like the texture on the bowl and garnishes more accurately. For a phone targeted at gamers, it would have been so easy to cut corners on the ROG Phone’s camera quality. But Asus didn’t, and instead of being just OK—while still not quite on the level of a Pixel 3 or Galaxy S9—it turns out that the ROG Phone ain’t half bad.In the end, the most divisive thing about the ROG Phone is its $900 starting price. That’s not to say that Asus’ gaming phone doesn’t have the specs or features to back that up, it does, well at least as much as any phone that cost close to $1,000 can. But anything this niche and this expensive is always going to be a tough sell.But when compared to the Razer Phone 2, the ROG Phone is better in almost every way. It’s got superior cameras, longer battery life, and nifty AirTriggers, and its collection of admittedly pricey accessories allow you to flex your mobile gaming muscle in a way Razer’s competitor doesn’t. And with outrageous styling and RGB lighting, the ROG Phone is unapologetic embrace of GaMeR LiFe, for better or worse.

58,Nokia 7.1,https://gizmodo.com/nokia-7-1-review-solid-budget-simplicity-1830529419,"Earlier this year, Huawei passed Apple to become the second largest smartphone maker in the world. That marks a big shift in the handset power rankings, but there’s one phone company that’s arguably made even bigger strides, and unlike Huawei, it’s a company you’ve almost certainly heard of before: NokiaWell kind of. Behind the recognizable name brand, modern Nokia phones have only existed for about two years after startup HMD Global bought the Nokia name back from Microsoft and returned the company to its Finnish roots. And in that short time, Nokia has already rocketed back into the top 10 for global phone market share, and thanks to devices like the Nokia 7.1, it’s not hard to see why.For just $350, the Nokia 7.1 ticks all the proper checkboxes for stuff you want and need on an inexpensive handset. Its Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 provides more than adequate performance, it comes with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (the same as a base Pixel 3), and you even get a microSD card slot and a headphone jack, which are features most new premium phones have abandoned. The one spec the 7.1 lacks that I wish it had is some form of water-resistance. Though to be fair, almost none of the 7.1's main competitors have official IP protection ratings either.And despite its affordable price tag, the Nokia 7.1 never feels cheap. Sure, its design is basically a glass brick with a strip of aluminum running around its sides, but little touches like diamond cut edges featuring accent colors that contrast with the Nokia’s midnight blue or stainless steel paint jobs add a bit of class. Even the 7.1's build has a sense of heft and solidity that you don’t quite get from other top-notch budget phones like the Moto G6.In front, the Nokia’s bright FHD+ screen even supports HDR 10, which means some content from services like YouTube, Netflix, and others looks better when played on the 7.1 compared to similarly priced competitors. And in cases when there’s no HDR-certified content, Nokia also includes a handy video feature that upconverts standard-definition content so that it looks a bit more vibrant.The one annoying thing about the 7.1's screen is that unlike most notched phones nowadays, there’s no option to hide the cutout, even if you go in and turn on the phone’s developer options. Thankfully, if you really can’t stand the way notches look, you can still combat that issue by using apps like this one.Around back, the 7.1 offers a 12-MP main camera, with a second 5-MP shooter for handling depth of field effects and portrait mode duties. And while you won’t be surprised to learn that the 7.1's camera can’t quite match what you get from a Pixel 3, Nokia’s budget phone still holds its ground quite well. I was especially impressed with the 7.1's daylight shots, including pictures of a fully loaded Christmas tree that came out quite close to a comparison pic taken by a Pixel 3.And on the inside, the Nokia 7.1 is part of Google’s Android One program, which means you get a clean, bloat-free version of Android, including updates and security patches managed by Google itself. Unfortunately, the Nokia 7.1 is still running Android 8 despite claims that an update to Pie was supposed to arrive before the end of October. I’ve reached out to Nokia to get a better idea of when an update might be available.Honestly, after checking out the whole device, there isn’t that much to complain about. But there are still a few things that could be improved, most notably the 7.1's battery life. On our rundown test, the 7.1 only managed a shade of 9 hours, which isn’t bad, but still less than the 10 hours most new phones deliver.The other potential issue is that unlike the Moto G6, the Nokia 7.1 is only available as an unlocked model from retailers like Amazon or Best Buy, and it doesn’t support CDMA networks like Verizon or Sprint. That means this phone is a non-starter for a fair number of people, and having fewer options to pay for the phone via a monthly plan could make it a tough sell for people looking to cut down on the upfront cost of a new device.But for those looking for a simple phone at the right price (and a hint of premium style), Nokia’s 7.1 embodies many of the same qualities that made the brand’s feature phones from the late 90s and early 2000s so memorable. It’s a solid, minimalist phone with pretty much every feature you need, and with a price tag of $350, even before any discounts, the Nokia 7.1 feels like a steal.Android 8.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 • 4GB of RAM • 64GB of storage • 5.8-inch 2280 x 1080 LCD screen • 8-MP front cam • 12-MP rear cam with 5-MP secondary cam • rear fingerprint reader • USB-C (2.0) port • 3.5mm port • microSD card slot • 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac wi-fi • Bluetooth 5.0 • 3,060 mAh battery • 5.89 x 2.80 x 0.31 inches • 5.64 ounces • available in gloss midnight blue and gloss steel"
59,Palm Ultra Tiny,https://gizmodo.com/palms-ultra-tiny-phone-is-an-absolute-snack-1830528949,"There’s just something about this phone. From the moment I laid eyes on this thing, it just kind of made me happy. It’s small and adorable like a newborn puppy, and despite how petite it appears it photos, it looks and feels even smaller in person. And I’m not the only one that had this reaction. When I brought it into the office, people crowded around marveled. One person cooed at it, another said, “it’s perfect,” while a third remarked that this is the exact sort of thing they’d wished someone would make for years.From a crowd of tech bloggers, even I was taken aback with its reception. Size alone isn’t what makes this handset remarkable. In part what makes the device exciting is that it’s the rebirth of Palm, the same company that made big ‘ole PDAs and the ill-fated Palm Pre. Maybe more interestingly, Palm’s new phone also envisions an entirely different way of using and living with tech.For something so small, it’s pretty mysterious, and I’m actually not even entirely sure what to call it. The company that makes it is Palm, but what about the device itself? Is it just Phone with a capital P, or is it the Palm Palm as its comical listing on Verizon’s website suggests? For now, I’ve been going with Baby Phone or the just the mononymous Palm, because like Grimes, Wario, and Rasputin, this gadget is cool enough to need only a single name.Now let’s talk about size. I don’t mean its actual dimensions—which are about the same as a credit card—but the reason behind why it’s so tiny. Recently, a lot of companies have been pushing the idea of digital wellness, with Google and Apple adding features to Android and iOS that help you track how much time you spend on your phone. That’s all fine, but in some ways, buying an $800 phone and then putting restrictions on it is like buying an Aston Martin and never driving it faster than 55 mph.So instead of spending a lot of money on a phone that constantly tempts you, why not get something small and nimble that can still handle traditional smartphone duties, but doesn’t also ruin your life. That’s the real inspiration behind the Palm’s pint-sized body and mini display. You’re supposed to pull it out, check the screen real quick, and then put it away.The Palm is a more straightforward way to fight smartphone addiction, and while it does quite well at replacing your regular phone, it has some quirks and a few sore spots you should know about. I’m going to break things down The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly style.First comes the good stuff. Unlike a dumb feature phone or other gadgets that attempt to fight Internet-driven FOMO, the Palm runs a full mobile OS (Android 8) with a custom home screen/app launcher designed to be easy to use on a tiny display. That means it supports all your favorite apps, and launching them is as simple as scrolling through a relatively compact grid of app icons and tapping on the one you want.Sure, things like text and quick settings icons look small, and if you’re someone who thinks about bifocals a lot, this may not be the device for you. But for everyone else, screen readability and UI navigation aren’t actually that bad. There’s even an old-school capacitive touch button below the screen that can be tapped once to go back, tapped twice to go home, or long-pressed to open up all your recent apps.On top of that, the Palm was designed to be used hands-free, by leveraging voice controls and the Google Assistant to do things like reply to texts or search for directions. If you feel weird about talking out loud to your devices, using the baby phone like this does take some getting used to, but it works.The phone even has a simple 2D face unlock system, so you don’t need to hit tiny number buttons every time you want to unlock your phone. And instead of squeezing the sides of the phone or long-pressing its home button, you can summon the Google Assistant just by holding down the power button, which is the phone’s lone physical control.Then there’s the baby phone’s build, which feels surprisingly solid. I really can’t help but admire how nice it is for a phone this small, especially since it can be stowed away almost anywhere. It utterly disappears into pockets, and you shouldn’t run into any issues sliding it into even the smallest of clutches. You can even stash it in your jeans’ coin pocket, or jam it down your sock if you’re so inclined. So, of course, it also feels puny in your hands like no other smartphone does.The baby phone’s screen is also exceedingly bright, hitting 808 nits on our light meter, which is higher than any phone I’ve tested in the last 18 months. And despite weighing barely more than two ounces, it still offers an IP68 rating, so it’ll survive a quick dip in water.Now onto the bad. Like most new smartphones, the baby phone doesn’t have a headphone jack or microSD card storage. However, due to its diminutive size, the excuse about not having enough room inside actually holds up. Same goes for the Palm’s lack of wireless charging, though, it would be kind of neat if the baby phone were a truly wire-free device.As for its camera, the Palm sports a 12-MP cam in the back and an 8-MP selfie cam up front. In bright light, these cameras are serviceable, though as you’d expect, the Palm’s pics don’t quite deliver the quality of what you’d get from a Pixel 3. Then again, with a retail price of $350, I’m not that bothered. But when things get dark, the Palm’s cameras struggle quite a bit more.Finally, while I wouldn’t exactly call the Palm’s performance or battery life bad, it fits best in this section. Browsing around between apps is usually quite snappy, but equipped with just a Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 chipset, it’s sort of ridiculous to ask for more. That said, you can still play things like Super Mario Run or Pokémon GO just fine, but in absolute numbers, the baby phone’s benchmarks are some of the lowest I’ve seen in a while.As for battery life, on our rundown test, it lasted a laughable three hours and six minutes, which is a quarter of what you get on a lot of flagship devices. But our test is performed by streaming video continuously over wifi, which goes against the entire idea of the phone, so it shouldn’t be a surprise that those numbers look bad. And if you play even the most casual of games like a match-three puzzler, you can crush the baby phone’s battery in 90 minutes or less.But if you actually try to embrace Palm’s internet-addiction fighting ways by just checking your phone a couple of times an hour, streaming music a little bit, and limiting it to other practical purposes, it’s quite possible for its battery to last all day. Instead of being a true con, the Palm’s battery life is almost a pro, because it punishes you for sliding back into abusive habits. Palm’s baby phone can help you improve your digital wellbeing, but only if you let it.For those still concerned about longevity, Plam even equipped its device with something called Life Mode, which helps preserve battery life while also cutting down on distractions. In this mode, when you lock your screen, the phone goes into a super Do Not Disturb of sorts. And as long as your screen stays dark, you won’t get any calls, texts or notifications. Then, when you want to check in on the world, you can unlock your phone and get a quick recap to fill you in.All told, the negatives above aren’t that bad, but just when you thought it was safe, comes Palm’s ugly side. The first nasty omission is that the Palm only sports 802.11 a/b/g/n wifi, which means that the phone can’t see any 5GHz 802.11 ac networks.But the Palm’s second and biggest deal-breaker for many is that the Palm is a Verizon exclusive, which leaves 65 percent of potential U.S. buyers out in the cold. And while the phone is technically an unlocked device, the pinhole for the Palm’s SIM tray is so small it’s damn near impossible to remove, and there’s a good chance you might damage the tray if you try to force it. And as if to discourage any additional attempts to remove the SIM tray, the Palm doesn’t come bundled with its own ejector like most phones nowadays. And even if you do manage to crack open that SIM tray, the baby phone is missing a number of LTE bands that would allow it to work fully on other networks.To make matters worse, because this phone is billed as a companion device, Verizon won’t sell you a baby phone unless you already have a primary device (even though the Palm works just fine on its own and doesn’t actually need a second device to connect to cell service or wi-fi). And if that wasn’t enough, on top of the Palm’s $350 price tag, you’ll also need to fork over $10 a month for data and the luxury of using Verizon’s Number Share service, which allows you to use the same phone number across multiple devices instead of having to juggle a second set of digits. Number Share also lets the Palm sync texts with your primary phone, so you don’t miss any messages, but only if you use Verizon’s texting app.Now don’t get me wrong, I can totally see the appeal this thing being used to compliment a larger and more powerful handset. You have one phone for work and business, and the Palm for everything else. Going out for a fancy dinner and don’t want to be loaded down with tech? The baby phone is an easy choice. Or how about going for a run? The Palm is a better option for making sure you are reachable and for streaming music than many wearables, even the ones with built-in LTE.But not allowing the Palm to operate as a standalone phone is a tragedy. It would be a great handset for kids, and its battery life might mean teens would actually stay off their phone for fear of running out of juice. And what about all the people that just want a phone that’s small, cute, and simple. Forcing people to buy two phones when all they really want is one seems incredibly dumb.The Palm is one of the best examples yet of how you can stay connected without letting it drive you crazy. It can go practically anywhere, and it has just enough to make sure you don’t feel deprived. At first, I thought this tiny little phone was a snack. But you know what, that’s not quite right. It’s more like a full meal in a bite-sized package. And even with all the big shiny phones that came out this year, this little baby phone with child-like specs is easily one of my favorites. It’s a shame that some of the business decisions behind it mean that more people won’t be able to see it for the treat is truly is.Runs Android 8.0 • 3.3-inch 1280 x 720 LCD display (445 PPI) • Snapdragon 435 processor • 3GB of RAM • 32GB of storage • 802.11 a/b/g/n wi-fi • 8-MP front cam • 12-MP rear cam • IP68 water-resistance • Bluetooth 4.2 • 800 mAh battery • 3.80 x 1.99 x 0.39 inches • 2.13 ounces • available in titanium or gold • supports LTE bands 2/4/5/13/17/66[Update 10:55 AM] Added more information regarding the Palm’s SIM tray and the phone’s carrier exclusivity."
60,Huawei Mate 20 pro,https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-20-pro-is-a-technical-marvel-1830346004,"If we judged the new Mate 20 and Mate 20 Pro like Olympic figure skaters, they’d no doubt earn 10s across the board for technical merit. That’s because even though they don’t have a built-in stylus, Huawei’s new flagship phone duo offers almost every other feature you could want, and I don’t just mean the easy shit.We’re talking full-on 3D face-scanning, a fingerprint sensor built into the screen, three cameras in the back (including one with a 3x zoom on the Mate 20 Pro), and even reverse wireless charging that can be used to top off your other gadgets. And with even more striking color options, a sleeker chassis, and class-leading specs, the Mate 20 earns high marks for artistry and execution too.I mean, just look at them. Especially when clad in Huawei’s signature twilight paint job, it’s not hard to imagine the Mate 20 out on the ice pulling off double axels and triple toe loops. Huawei even paid attention to little details both inside and out when it comes to things like the phones’ brightly colored power buttons, or all the improvements in Huawei’s EMUI 9 skin for Android. Unlike the Galaxy Note 9, EMUI is based on the latest version of Android 9 Pie and includes tweaks to help cut down on menu bloat, handy options like a built-in dark theme, and multiple ways to customize your UI.That said, it’s a little disheartening to see apps like Booking.com and eBay pre-installed out of the box, especially on phones that start at around $1,000. I also noticed that when trying to search for key features like Huawei’s Performance Mode, I wasn’t able to find it by using the search bar in the settings menu. So despite Huawei’s efforts to streamline the endless options in a phone and make things easier to find, there’s still a room for refinement left in Huawei’s routine.As for the various Mate 20 models, the Mate 20 Pro is the more luxurious of the two. Even though it offers a slightly smaller 6.39-inch screen (versus 6.5 inches for the standard Mate 20), the panel is OLED rather than LCD and slightly higher resolution, which results in sharper and more vibrant pictures and images. In a vacuum, both screens look good, but side-by-side, the difference is obvious.But more importantly, the Mate 20 Pro is the one loaded up with tech. It’s got more base RAM, an in-screen fingerprint reader that feels even snappier than what you get in a OnePlus 6T, and a useful notch that includes a 3D infrared dot projector that scans your face in much the same way Apple’s Face ID. For people worried about security, this is a significant upgrade over the simpler 2D face recognition found on almost every other Android phone.And it’s not all sparkly sequins and shiny tech either because the Mate 20 duo also sports an IP68 rating for dust and water-resistance and Huawei’s new Kirin 980 processor and even built-in IR blasters for people who like being able to use their phone as a TV remote. It’s the second time Huawei has pulled this stunt, but I still find it annoying that only the standard Mate 20 offers a headphone jack.Both Mate 20s also offer outstanding endurance, with the standard model posting a battery life of 15 hours and 15 minutes on our rundown test. That’s a full hour better than a Galaxy Note 9 (14:11). And while its more expensive sibling didn’t fare quite that well, thanks to an even larger 4,200 mAh battery, the Mate 20 Pro has enough juice to offset its higher-res screen and more power-hungry components and still pump out a superb time of 14:06.In normal usage, this means both phones will almost always have an excess of energy, so Huawei figured out a way to make those reserves useful by including reverse wireless charging too. And while finding the sweet spot to charge up other devices like wireless earbuds or even other phones can be a little finicky, this feature is something I’d love to see on more phones in the future. It’s so easy. Just go in the battery settings, hit the toggle for reverse charging, and them slam a Qi-compatible device onto the Mate 20's back. No wires required.But the highlight features in Huawei’s long program are its triple camera in the back. For this review, I spent most of my time using the Mate 20 Pro, as the standard Mate 20 features an almost identical setup and similar image quality to what you get from the P20 Pro Huawei released earlier this spring. But the Mate 20 Pro steps things up with a new wide angle lens for all your big, open landscape shooting needs, the same 40-MP main camera as before, and a new 8-MP cam with a 3x zoom.Just going by image quality alone, the Mate 20 Pro is almost certainly the Pixel 3's biggest photo rival. But when you add in the capabilities of those extra lenses and sensors on top of all of Huawei’s software tricks, the Mate 20 Pro has the biggest and most robust photo toolkit of any phone on the market. The number of photo modes alone is staggering, with Huawei offering options for things like light painting, timelapse, document scanning, and more. There’s even an underwater mode designed for use with a special waterproof case, so you can snap pics while swimming. And if it wasn’t for Google’s newly released Night Sight mode, Huawei’s night mode would boast the most impressive low-light capabilities on the market.When it comes to the Mate 20 Pro’s claimed 3x zoom though, I discovered something peculiar. According to its specs, the zoom lens features an 8-MP sensor, but when you hit the 3x button in the camera app and snap a pic, the resolution of the resulting image is 3648 x 2736, which is effectively 10 megapixels, and the same size as the pics you get from the phone’s main cam. This makes you wonder how much data the Mate 20 Pro’s 3x zoom lens is actually gathering, and how much info the phone is getting from the other lenses on back. What’s even stranger is that the wide angle lens doesn’t seem to suffer from this, as images captured by it are 5120 x 3840, which matches up with its 20-MP listed spec.It’s possible that much of the heavy lifting is shared between the 40-MP main camera and the 8-MP zoom sensor, and that Huawei is using some sort of computational photography to hit that 3x zoom, but at this point, it’s pretty safe to say that the Mate 20 Pro’s zoom isn’t purely optical in nature. I’ve reached out to Huawei for more info on Mate 20 Pro’s zoom camera, and will update the review if I hear back.But perhaps the biggest issue with the Mate 20 Pro’s picture taking is when Huawei’s AI photo tuning gets overly aggressive. It’s distracting enough when you see colors pop in and out as Huawei’s machine learning algorithms detect things like food or flowers, but in a shot I took of some apples, Huawei’s Master AI made them look damn near radioactive next to a shot captured by a Pixel 3. Thankfully, you can dismiss these enhancements if things look wonky, or disable Master AI entirely using the toggle in the setting menus. I wouldn’t do that, though, because when it works, pics snapped by the Mate 20 Pro defy their humble smartphone origins. It’s that good.Really, after checking out the Mate 20 and Mate 20, that goodness permeates both devices. Even with all their innovative tech, you don’t run into bugs or errors that you might expect from something this cutting edge. The Mate 20's biggest downside is price, which starts at around $1,000 for the standard version, and goes up to $1,200 for the Mate 20 Pro.However, like some of the most memorable figure skating moments, there’s one last wrinkle when it comes to the judging. That’s because after questions concerning Huawei’s security and trustworthiness by organizations including the FBI and CIA made earlier this year, Huawei didn’t make a U.S. specific variant of the Mate 20 like it has for its previous three Mate-series phones. Technically, you can still buy the phone through retailers like Amazon, but only as an unlocked international model, which means the phone may not support carrier-specific features like RCS or wifi calling.So for many Americans, instead of the Mate 20 being a welcome and even more technically advanced alternative to the Apple and Samsung duopoly, the phone will probably end up with a DQ. That’s a feeling that stings like a cheap shot to the knee because the Mate 20 is a seriously good phone, but one that us here in the U.S. won’t be able to fully appreciate."
61,OnePlus 6t,https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6t-review-the-no-bullshit-best-deal-in-smartph-1830066240,"Since its inception, OnePlus has danced around the fringes of the smartphone market, catering to nerds and enthusiasts with spec-laden devices for reasonable prices. And unlike the Apples and the Samsungs of the world, OnePlus has thrived even though it really only makes one product a year, typically released in the spring and then refreshed in the fall. And while the OnePlus 6T is the expected remix to the OnePlus 6 I checked out earlier this year, it represents a big step forward for OnePlus as a major player in the phone game and for people who just want a damn good handset.Previously, in order to attract new customers, OnePlus was largely reliant on word of mouth and efforts like collabs with streetwear brands to drive unlocked phone sales through its website. And that’s fine when a company is still in startup mode, but in the U.S. where just 12 percent or so of smartphones are purchased as unlocked devices, that strategy puts some serious limits on a phone’s reach. But starting with the 6T, OnePlus has partnered with T-Mobile to make its phones available for purchase in brick-and-mortar carrier stores for the first time ever. And on top of that, OnePlus also worked with Verizon to offer full compatibility with Big Red’s network, which is another OnePlus first.This one-two combo means that now, customers on carriers that collectively hold over 85 percent of the U.S.’ wireless market can turn to a OnePlus phone as a real option for their next phone, a big improvement from past years when OnePlus devices were strictly limited to GSM networks. And with the 6T now available from T-Mobile, potential buyers can purchase the phone with monthly payments instead all at once—which for better or worse is simply how things are done in the States—thereby lowering the barrier to entry even more.Meanwhile, on the tech side, while the 6T features essentially the same glass-backed design OnePlus debuted six months ago, the phone sports some clever new tricks, most notably of which is a new in-screen fingerprint reader. Yup, that’s right, before smartphone giants like Samsung, LG, or Apple figured out how to properly marry screens and fingerprint sensors, OnePlus (along with the help of its parent company BBK Electronics) is the first company to bring this feature to the U.S. in a meaningful way.That means now you can have a front-facing fingerprint reader without needing sacrifice on screen size, and when combined with a new and more compact teardrop-shaped notch up top and only the slightest of chins down bottom, there’s even more of the OnePlus 6T’s 6.4-inch AMOLED screen to enjoy. And with a claimed unlock time of 0.34 seconds, OnePlus says its integrated optical fingerprint reader is just as fast as the capacitive touch sensors used on the back of the OnePlus 6.The way it works is that beneath the screen, there’s a tiny camera that looks up at your finger, and any anytime you want to unlock your phone, it fires a green light at your digits to ensure the most accurate reading possible. In practice, things are even simpler. All you have to tap your finger on the scanner, and voila, you’re in. However, there are a couple things do have an impact on how fast the whole process really feels.To spice things up, OnePlus added three different animations to the unlock process, so there’s no doubt when that optical fingerprint reader is working. However, somewhat contrary to what you might think, you don’t actually need to hold your finger down until the end of the animation, which often takes longer than what the phone actually needs to ID your print, something that can make it seem like in-screen scanner is slower than it actually is. At the same time, I did run into a few situations where I pulled my finger away a bit too quickly, so there’s is still a bit of an adjustment, even if it’s mostly a mental one. Anecdotally, I found the in-screen fingerprint reader is less tolerant of off-angle taps, and like all fingerprint readers, OnePlus’ optical scanner can still be a bit finicky, sometimes require a long dead-center press instead of a quick tap to let you in.Unfortunately, there is a downside to the 6T’s in-screen fingerprint reader, because due to the placement of the optical sensor beneath the bottom section of the display, that left basically no room for a headphone jack. So instead of trying to move that port somewhere else, OnePlus said screw it. At this point, it’s hard to get too mad about that decision, as it’s clear that’s where the smartphone industry is heading, but since OnePlus along with Samsung was one of the few companies that previously hadn’t yet axed the headphone jack, it’s sorta sad to see more gadget maker say goodnight to our once beloved port.As for the rest of the 6T’s specs, you still get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip and your choice of 6GB or 8GB of RAM. But the real bonus is that for the same $550 starting price as the old OnePlus 6, the 6T’s base storage has been increased from 64GB to 128GB, with an optional 256GB model available for $630. The OP6T’s battery has also received a sizable bump up from 3,300 mAh to 3,700, and the difference in longevity is quite noticeable. On our rundown test, the standard OP6 managed a solid 13 hours and 3 minutes, but on the 6T, we got an even better 14:37. That’s pretty damn good considering that despite having a bigger 4,000 mAh battery (though with a higher-res screen) the Galaxy Note 9 only lasted 14:11 on the same test.Elsewhere, the 6T’s other major improvements include enhanced portrait and selfie modes, along with a new Night Mode specifically designed to improve dynamic range and general image quality in low-light scenarios. However, in head-to-head testing against a Pixel 3, while OnePlus’ Night Mode did a solid job of cutting down on noise, I found it also oversharpened photos to the point where some bright lights pop out a little too much, while hard lines have halo artifacts around them. Night mode is a nice extra tool to have for when things get real dark, but it’s not exactly a game changer.As for normal photos, OnePlus has also hopped on the trend of using AI to identify objects and accordingly adjust the settings, except that on the OP6T, there’s no pop up or icon that tells you when it’s happening. OnePlus prefers a less intrusive approaching to AI photo tuning, which is generally fine, but it can result in situations where your pics suddenly look rich and more vivid when the AI kicks in. As a whole, while the OnePlus 6T can’t quite match the kind of pics you’d get from a Pixel 3, it comes damn close, and even in a few situations, even topped Google’s proprietary HDR magic.Lastly, while talking about software typically isn’t very interesting, I feel like it’s important to note how far OnePlus’ Oxygen OS has come. After years of streamlining, making animations feel smooth, and focusing on app management that’s based more on actual usage instead of simply how much RAM an app takes up, Oxygen OS sometimes feels like an even better version of Android than what you’d get on a Pixel. It’s super snappy, there’s no bloat, and you get bonuses like a built-in dark theme, UI customizations, and the choice of three different navigation setups (the three button Android nav, the Android 9 Pie “pill,” and full on gestures) that you don’t get from Google’s stock OS.In the end, while in absolute terms a Pixel 3 or Galaxy S9+ might be a better overall phone than a OnePlus 6T, are those phone’s really worth $300 more? Or how about a whopping $500 in the case of something like an iPhone XS? Sure, for some folks, the OnePlus 6T’s lack of wireless charging, a microSD card slot, and official water-resistance might be downers.But for all the people who say they want something fast and reliable for a decent price, the OnePlus 6T is your phone. It’s got excellent battery life, flagship specs, and a neat in-screen fingerprint reader Americans can’t really get on anything else yet. And now, thanks to wider availability and better carrier support, the OnePlus 6T needs to be a serious consideration for anyone looking to sidestep the onslaught of $1,000 phones. While its original motto always felt a bit trite, five years after its start, OnePlus’ latest phone is closer to being a flagship killer than ever before.Oxygen OS (based on Android 9 pie) • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 • 6GB/8GB of RAM • 128GB/256GB of storage • in-screen optical fingerprint sensor • 6.4-inch 2340 x 1080 AMOLED display • 16-MP front camera • dual 20-MP rear cameras • USB 2.0 Type-C port • dual nano sim tray • 3,700 mAh battery, bottom-firing speaker • 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.32 inches • 6.52 ounces • compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon • available in mirror black and midnight black"
62,Red Hydrogen,https://gizmodo.com/the-red-hydrogen-one-is-a-phone-made-for-an-alternate-r-1830015204,"Jim Jannard is an interesting guy. After starting a one-man business selling motorcycle parts, he decided to pivot into goggles and eyewear. Fast forward about 25 years, and Oakley had become one of the biggest sunglass brands in the world. Then in 2007, after selling Oakley for $2.1 billion, Jannard turned to his other company, and that same year, Red shipped its first 4K cinema-grade digital camera. Both companies are highly successful ventures by any definition, so for his third pivot, Jannard thought he would set his sights even higher and make a smartphone unlike anything else on the market. But this time, I think Jim may have gone a little too far because instead of making something you might want to buy, the Red Hydrogen One, with its ambitious 3D display, feels like a phone that teleported from a different dimension.Crafted from a scalloped aluminum frame and Kevlar panels (a titanium-clad model coming soon), the Hydrogen One looks like a tank and feels even heavier. It has ribbed grooves running down its back and sides that you can grate cheese on, and in back there’s a red jewel surrounded by engraved metal that reads Red Media Machine. All this combines to deliver a kind of rarefied durability, and it’s the first time in a long while I feel like there’s a phone that will never need a case to stay safe. In short, the Hydrogen One is the complete antithesis to the modern glass sandwich smartphone.But the outlandishness doesn’t stop there, because in addition to a USB-C port for data and charging, the Hydrogen One features a (gasp) headphone jack and a microSD card tray that you can pull out with your fingernail, rather than relying on one of those tiny tray ejector pins that instantly disappears the second you get a new phone. And on its sides, in addition to separate buttons for volume up and down, there’s a lock button on the right with a built-in fingerprint reader and a dedicated camera button—very fitting for a phone made by Red.All of this is just preamble to the Hydrogen One’s highlight feature: its 4View display. So what does 4View stand for? I’m not totally sure and Red’s website doesn’t exactly spell it out either. But what 4View supposedly delivers is pretty out there. 4View is what Red claims to be the “world’s first holographic screen,” and its components include all the hottest buzzwords. It’s powered by nanotechnology via a unique Lightfield screen which promises immersive 3D images without the need for glasses. (For those that want to know more about how 4View actually works, check out this interview with one of the creators of the tech here.)Sadly, those fancy words and added depth don’t come across in normal pictures or videos, which means it’s something that can only be experienced in person. And to me, the Hydrogen One’s display is really just a slightly better version of what you’d get on a new Nintendo 3DS. And it’s true, even without glasses, images do seem to leap off the screen and hover in mid-air, but it’s not the sort of revolutionary display I was expecting to see after over a year of hype.In my opinion, still images using the technology look better than videos, with photos featuring things with hard lines like a sculpture or tree doing the best job of making 4View really pop. But there are still a lot of issues. While in normal 2D mode, the Hydrogen One’s 5.7 4View display is relatively high-res at 2560 x 1440. But when you turn 3D on, you can immediately see that the screen’s resolution is significantly reduced to the point where you can see individual pixels. On top of that, nothing ever looks that sharp, and there’s always a faint rainbow color cast lurking in the background that makes things look more dreamy than real. But I might just be a little jaded, so to get a better sense of what others might think, check out our video to see fellow GMG staffers and their first experience with 4View (check out the video above).Red knows its 4View display alone wasn’t going to be enough to sell this phone because outside of other Hydrogen One owners sharing pics with each other via the Holopix app or a few other tools, there’s a limited bucket of 3D content to check out. The Hydrogen Network app offers 20 or so movie snippets that you can watch, while the Red Leia Loft app tacks on support for games like but that’s about it. (Oh, AT&T is also giving people who buy a Hydrogen One from them free 4View versions of Ready Player One and Fantastic Beasts). So to help flesh out available 4View content, Red made sure that the Hydrogen One can not only show 3D, it can capture 3D too.Using the dual cameras in front and back, the Hydrogen can shoot both 3D stills and video, though there are limitations. For the front-facing cams, you can only shoot 3D in portrait orientation, which isn’t actually a big deal. But in back, you are limited to just landscape shots, which is more annoying. Some issues might stem from the tech still being early in its development cycle, such as 4View video recording turning off in the middle of a clip because the phone thinks it’s too bright outside. But even if you can ignore those problems, the Hydrogen’s One’s standard image quality doesn’t impress.In almost ideal conditions at a well-lit bakery, the Hydrogen One’s camera produced a shot that looked dull, lifeless, and just generally worse than what I got from a Pixel 3. Next, when I shot a picture of some pumpkins, the Hydrogen One struggled with dynamic range, as seen in its blown-out highlights and underexposed details in the shadows. And at night, things got really bad, with the Hydrogen One producing seriously blurry and noisy images repeatedly in multiple locations. Even the phone’s camera app features an awkward UI. To capture 3D pics, you need to hit the 2D button to switch between shooting modes, and to switch into video mode, you need to hit the camera button. It doesn’t really make a lot of sense, and it’s definitely not intuitive. There’s also seemingly no option to show grid lines to help with composition, and while I do appreciate that Red included the ability to display a histogram, that might be the nicest thing I can say about the phone’s camera.I suppose that after seeing first-time phone makers like Essential and Razer struggle to nail image quality out of the gate, I shouldn’t be surprised. But given Red’s heritage, I was expecting a much better showing.Theoretically, all this could be solved through the Hydrogen One’s modular add-on system, which promises to someday let the phone connect to the company’s super expensive cameras, or attach a standalone sensor and third-party lenses from camera makers including Nikon, Canon, Sony, Leica, and others. But those mods don’t exist yet, and there’s no telling when they’ll arrive.Where things start to get truly ugly though is that for a phone that costs $1,300, its specs are outdated from day one. It’s got a Snapdragon 835 chip from last year, and while 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage are nice, it’s still running Android 8.1, and Red says Android 9 won’t arrive until sometime in 2019. (Currently, its security patch dates back to July, so hopefully, Red addresses that before it goes on sale November 2.) Its LCD display also isn’t very colorful and doesn’t sport the contrast ratios you’d get from a more modern OLED panel. Even the Hydrogen One’s massive 4,500 mAh hour battery is held back by inefficient components, because with a run time of 11:51, Red’s phone lasts an hour or two less than an iPhone XS Max (13:07) or a Galaxy Note 9 (14:11), and is only marginally better than a Pixel 3 XL (11:24).Ultimately, the Hydrogen One is a very beefy handset with dated internals, no water-resistance or wireless charging, a splashy screen that’s only a bit better than a Nintendo 3DS, and overall image quality that puts Red’s own name to shame. If that doesn’t sound like a phone conjured up in an alternate reality, I don’t know what does. And while there’s still a chance Red can redeem the Hydrogen One and its tech in the future, it’s going to be a long time until a lot of people not named Jim Jannard will really want to own this phone.Android 8.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 • 6GB of RAM • 128GB of storage • microSD card slot • 2560 x 1440 5.7-inch LCD display • dual 8-MP front cams • dual 12-MP rear cams • Bluetooth 5.0 • USB-C • 3.5mm jack • 4,500 mAh battery 6.48 x 3.37 x 0.39 inches• 9.27 ounces• available from AT&T and Verizon • aluminum version comes in black and gray, titanium model coming soon"
63,iPhone XR,https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xr-is-apples-new-real-big-deal-1829912968,"Apple does not typically do budget devices, but as they go, the iPhone XR comes pretty close. While hardly cheap (a budget phone should be under $400, not $750!), it represents a calculated attempt at creating a more affordable device that isn’t a tremendous compromise. Something powerful enough that you can enjoy the perks of having the latest tech, without having to spend top dollar. And that’s an extremely big deal, especially if spending $1000 on a phone feels like too much for you.If you’re trying to choose between the $750 XR and the XS and XS Max, which start at $1,000 and $1,100 respectively, you’ll find that there aren’t too many differences on paper. They all use the same Face ID that we loved from last year’s X. They all have a big notch and edge-to-edge displays. They’re running on the same A12 processor (you can read our take on that here). But the XR is much cheaper than the XS, and cutting the cost required quite a few compromises. The sides are aluminum instead of steel and it’s rated to IP67 instead of IP68—which means it’s good for up to 30 minutes of immersion in 1 meter of water instead of 2 meters. It’s also sized oddly, finding itself smack in middle between the XS and XS Max instead of being larger or smaller than both. Yet the biggest two differences are the display and the cameras. The XR uses a cheaper LCD display instead of the vibrant OLED found in the XS, and it has only one camera on the back instead of two.Those are some notably major cost-cutting measures for a $750 phone. Consider that if you’re willing to ditch Apple, there are some loaded phones for a lot less: OnePlus makes a great $550 phone that includes dual rear cameras, an OLED display, and a current generation chipset! But Apple has always done “inexpensive” devices differently than the rest. In some cases, cheaper devices mean older models, like the iPhone 7 or the MacBook Air, that just stay in circulation way past their prime. In others, they are new underpowered devices, like the iPhone SE or 5c, featuring appallingly outmoded hardware. In both cases, the compromises have been painful enough to make the devices at least somewhat unappealing. With the iPhone XR, Apple has gotten its take on an affordable device right.The first thing you’ll notice on most iPhone XRs is the color. The XR is the first phone Apple’s produced in a playful color palate in a while. Besides the traditional white and black, there’s also a lovely red, coral, yellow, and blue. The colors are eye-catching, though the aluminum sides don’t match the vibrant glass backs. Consequently, the phone can look a little cheap, especially next to the stainless steel sides on the XS. But if you’re like me you’ll find yourself shoving it into a case at the earliest opportunity to protect all that glass and easily scratchable aluminum. And that means your eyes will be immediately drawn to the display.Just like the XS and Max, the XR has a notch, and as with those phones, it gives it a sense of ostentatious luxury. At a glance, this phone looks expensive. The True Depth camera embedded in the notch gives the phone the ability to use Face ID which is just a hair faster than the Face ID introduced in last year’s iPhone X. If you’ve been reluctant to upgrade because you prefer Touch ID, you’ll need to come to terms with that on your own. Touch ID is gone. This phone, and likely all iPhones going forward, will rely on your face to unlock, and I for one am entirely okay with that. (You can use an old-fashioned passcode if you don’t like your phone looking at you.)I’ve been using a 5.8-inch iPhone X for the last year and have never thought that display to be too small, but next to the XR it feels minuscule. The 6.1-inch display packed into the XR chassis splits the difference between the enormous 6.5-inch display in the Max and the 5.8-inch display in the XS and X. The 8 Plus’s 5.5-inch display is also dwarfed by the XR’s despite having a larger body overall. However you might feel about the notch, you’ll find it difficult to look at an 8 Plus or older iPhone and not think they look positively lame next to the expansive display on the XR.Now about that compromise. The XR display is not nearly as good as the display found in the XS or Max. Those devices use an OLED display with rich blacks and enviable contrast. The XR uses an LCD display, which can’t get nearly as black—so images look a little washed out in comparison and when watching content with black bars on the side, the notch sticks out in a way it doesn’t on iPhones with an OLED display.Its 1792 x 828 resolution is much lower resolution than both the XS and last year’s 8 Plus, but you probably won’t notice that. What you will notice is the pixel density. The iPhone XR stoops to 326 ppi—the same as the iPhone 8. The XS, by comparison, has a pixel density of 458ppi, while the iPhone 8 Plus has a density of 401ppi. What this means is that you can see the pixels of the XR’s LCD more easily than you might other phones. The pixels are evident if you’re looking for them— you’ll need a macro lens, magnifying glass or excellent close-range visual acuity, but they’re there!Surprisingly less obvious is the size of the damn thing. At 5.94 inches by 2.98 inches by .33 inches, the XR rests squarely between the XS (5.64 inches by 2.79 inches by 0.30 inches) and the XS Max (6.24 inches by 3.07 inches by 0.30 inches). It’s smaller than the Max, as well as the identically-sized iPhone 8 Plus. Meanwhile, it’s a little larger than the XS.To get more specific, it’s about a third of an inch taller than the XS, and a third of an inch shorter than the XS Max. It’s also .19 inches wider than the XS, and 0.07 inches narrower than the Max. Those differences feel small, but they’re surprisingly crucial for a lot of potential buyers. You’ll absolutely notice the size if you’re used to smaller phones like the XS, SE, or even the standard 8.Personally, I was put off by the size of the XR immediately, but after a long weekend with the device, I’ve found myself much less annoyed. Would I like a smaller budget phone that doesn’t compromise speed or display quality? Absolutely! Do I find the XR unusable in my teeny tiny hands? Nope! As with the Max, Apple has included a feature, deep in the Accessibility settings, that lets you drag the top of the phone down towards the middle of the display so you can access the absolutely vital systems drop down. It takes a little getting used to, and you’ll screw up activating it the first few times, but by the end of the weekend, I found myself to be something of a pro with the feature.If size is a major consideration for you, I’d encourage you to go into a store and hold the XR in your hand—it’s the only real way to know if it’s too big for you and your back pocket.The last time Apple made a serious attempt at a budget phone it was the iPhone SE—a device with great hardware design but a processor at least a year older than the other phones made by Apple. This time around, Apple is not asking users to compromise speed for price, and the XR has the same zippy A12 processor as the XS and XS Max.In day-to-day use app use, like web browsing and checking your email, you won’t notice a difference between what it can do compared to the pricier phones or versus the A11 in last year’s iPhones. One exception is battery life. The A12 has worked wonders on the battery life of the phones that contain it. We saw this with the XS, which lasted about an hour and ten minutes longer than the X in our tests, and we see it again with the XR which lasted quite a bit longer than the 8 Plus, despite the 8 Plus having a larger battery.In our test, in which we set the brightness to 200 nits, turn off all radios except the wifi, and stream a video on YouTube until the phone powers down, the iPhone 8 Plus lasted a measly 9 hours and 10 minutes and the iPhone XR lasted an impressive 11 hours and 59 minutes. For comparison, the iPhone XS Max (3174 mAh) lasted 13 hours and 7 minutes, and the XS (2658 mAh) lasted 11 hours and 11 minutes.The other noticeable change the A12 delivers is in camera performance. It lets the XR pull off tricks with a single lens that last year’s iPhone 8 (the only single lens phone from Apple in 2017) could not. This processor actually lets the XR properly compete with the 8 Plus, a phone with twice the number of cameras on the back.And yes, one of the most important things about phones these days is the camera. From messaging to social media, it’s just so central to much of what we do with our phones. The XR uses software and the A12 processor to, for the most part, deliver photo performance comparable to the 8 Plus. It has a wider lens (26mm versus 28mm) so it captures more of the world in a snap, but the images are sharp and vibrant (though, as with the XS, the Smart HDR feature can sometimes be too aggressive and result in smoothing effects critics have derided as unnatural beautification).If you notice I keep comparing the XR to the 8 Plus and not the XS or XS Max—that’s because there’s just a $50 price difference between the $700 8 Plus and the $750 XR. It feels like the more apt phone to draw comparisons to—especially when we talk cameras. Because the XR actually uses the exact same wide-angle lens and sensor as the XS and XS Max. The only difference, camera-wise, between the XR and Apple’s flagship phones is it lacks a telephoto lens.So when I went on a long walk through Red Hook over the weekend, I left the XS and Max at home and carried just the XR and 8 Plus. I found myself not actually missing the telephoto lens (a 56mm equivalent) I from the XS. Sure it would have been more handy for snapping a shot of a sign well out of reach, but when taking pictures of a flower, my attempts at a macro shot with the XR were sharper and clearer than the 8 Plus despite the 40 miles-per-hour wind whipping my hand and the flowers all around.The XR also caught more details of the waves in this shot of the Upper Bay. And note the clouds—where you can again see more details thanks to the superior dynamic range of the XR. It simply caught more of the real world in a photo and translated it to the display.The improved dynamic range helped in this photo of a street sign at night too. The red hand in the photo below is just a big orange blob when shot with the 8 Plus, but you can see each individual bulb with the XR.But while the camera quality is impressive, there is one major shortcoming—the XR has the full Portrait Mode on the front cameras, but not on the back. Portrait Mode allows the phone’s cameras to mimic the creamy bokeh found in larger standalone cameras giving you a nice blurry background that better highlights your subject. On smartphones, this typically requires two cameras placed by one another. Any iPhone with Face ID can do it on the front—making for attractive selfies. As two cameras are required phones like the 7 and 8 have been unable to do it. Only the 7 Plus, 8 Plus, X, XS, and XS Max could accomplish portrait photos with their dual rear cameras.But despite having a single rear camera the XR uses software and the sheer number-crunching power of the A12 processor to accomplish a similar effect, with two big caveats. One is that it will only do three of the portrait lighting modes: Natural, Studio, and Contour. The Stage Light and Stage Light Mono modes won’t work—which means no all black background for portraits shot with the rear camera. But the second caveat has the potential to be the bigger one—the rear Portrait Mode only works with human faces. Teddy Ruxpin, Funko dolls, and my roommate’s cat do not count. A pop up will appear noting a human face needs to be in the frame for Portrait Mode to work.At first, this felt like it could be a deal breaker, but I’ve always found using Portrait Mode with the rear camera to be a challenge. You have to have just the right amount of light and distance so snapping a quick pic of your cat is usually out of the question. Not having the pressure of pulling off a clutch portrait snap is kind of nice—even if I miss the flexibility it allows.As we’ve said numerous times in this review, compared to the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is full of compromises. If you want a brand new cutting-edge iPhone for under $1,000 you’ll have to sacrifice some of your rear portrait shots. And you’ll have to sacrifice the prettier display. Yet at this point, for most people, I think the sacrifices are acceptable. If you are a nerdy gadget lover, these are limitations that will seem disappointing. I assure you that in practice they are not.The iPhone XR is really good, just as the XS, XS Max, X, 8, 8 Plus, and even the 7 and 7 Plus are. The improvements we’re seeing year to year are nice, but they’re rarely the kind of improvements that would motivate a person to go drop $750 or more on a phone.In that respect, the iPhone XR isn’t a required upgrade to people owning the 8 or 8 Plus. It isn’t even required if you own the 7 or 7 Plus. But the upgrades are very, very good, and you’ll find yourself smiling as you appreciate the photos it takes, or as you relish the fact your phone can last through not just a cross-country flight, but the awful delays on both ends of the flight too.The XR is good enough that I don’t miss the XS. Apple undercut itself, and we’re all better off for it."
64,The Razer Phone 2,https://gizmodo.com/the-razer-phone-2s-biggest-upgrade-is-being-better-at-e-1829897210,"When Razer birthed a new category of phone last year, the company offered gamers two features that weren’t typically found on your average handset: a big 4,000 mAh battery and a fantastic 120Hz display that made games look and feel extra smooth. But now that the rest of the smartphone world has started to care more about gaming, aside from its screen and new obligatory RGB lighting, how does Razer take the idea of a gaming handset even further on the new Razer Phone 2?The answer is by enhancing the phone so that it’s just as proficient at everyday tasks like watching movies, taking pictures, or handling the rigors of everyday life as it is at gaming. That’s because while the first Razer phone put a neat spin on what people could get from a handset, it often felt like a single-minded device rather than something you’d want to carry around all the time.So for its second go, Razer kept that 5.7-inch 120Hz screen while nearly doubling its brightness from a mediocre 350 nits to 615 nits. This matches (or exceeds) the  brightness you’d get on a Galaxy Note 9 (616 nits) or iPhone XS (547 nits) and makes it much easier to see the phone’s screen, especially in direct sunlight. Next, Razer added IP67 water-resistance to make sure the phone wouldn’t conk out any time it got a slight whiff of moisture. And even with the additional  seals used to keep water out, the Razer Phone 2's speakers are now even more powerful, and easily some of the loudest speakers on any smartphone out right now.Around back, Razer also swapped out the previous-gen phone’s metal back for glass, something that made the addition of Qi wireless charging possible. And of course, it’d be a mistake not to mention the new RGB light hidden beneath the Razer logo in back. It can pulse and breath a rainbow of colors just like other Chroma-powered gaming accessories, and as an added nod to functionality, the RGB lights can also blink different colors based on incoming notifications. Sadly, you don’t get to customize which colors blink for certain apps, so Snapchat is always yellow, Gmail is always red and so. But at least it’s a nice way to stealthily kept tabs on the internets even when the phone is turned upside down on a table.But by far Razer’s biggest upgrade for the Phone 2 is its new camera modules. Poor image quality tends to be an issue for numerous smartphone startups like Essential, and last year Razer found out the hard way that delivering a premium camera experience ain’t easy. And despite numerous post-launch updates, the original Razer phone often suffered from blurry out of focus images.So, on the Razer Phone 2, the company put dual sensors on front and back so you can snap portrait-style shots that everyone seems to love nowadays, while the rear also gets a bonus 2x zoom lens. Then you tack on improved auto HDR processing, better focus, and new optical image stabilization, and the results are a significantly improved camera experience.However, just so we’re clear, even with all the upgrades the Razer Phone 2's photos still aren’t quite as good as top-tier smartphone cams like the Pixel 3, as seen clearly in a quick side-by-side comparison. While the Razer Phone 2's pics are quite sharp, there’s a clear difference between it and the Pixel 3 when it comes to exposure and color saturation. And when conditions get dark, the Razer Phone 2 often produces a lot of noise. But for most, a lot of these shortcomings could easily be covered up by a filter or a quick edit in your favorite photo sharing app. What really matters is that the Razer Phone 2's cameras aren’t liabilities anymore.When it’s time to game—Razer, like every other Android phone this fall—has upgraded to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, while retaining a healthy 8GB of RAM, microSd card slot, and your choice of 64GB or 128GB of storage depending on which model you choose. (The base mirror black model comes with 64GB, while the satin black model features 128GB).There’s also a new vapor chamber heat sink that helps cool and distribute thermals better, and based on our benchmarks, there is a small, but noticeable effect. The Razer Phone 2 often scored 5 percent higher than other Snapdragon 845 devices on Geekbench 4 and 3DMark, a lead that it  held even after multiple runs. However, even with a more efficient processor and a big 4,000 mAh battery, the Razer Phone 2's battery life only increased by about half an hour over last year’s model to 9:45 on our rundown test. In the whole scheme of things, that’s just average.Finally, to help manage your games, Razer created the new Cortex app which features a Game Booster tab that lets you tweak settings including resolution, anti-aliasing, screen refresh rate and more on a per game basis. It’s nice when you know you want the full 120Hz for games like Need For Speed No Limits or Alto’s Odyssey, but maybe not so much on slower-paced titles like Plague Inc.Cortex also serves as a discovery tool for finding new games, though that means you will run into the occasional pop up ad. But my biggest gripe about the Cortex app is that it’s broken down into three categories (Featured, 120Hz games, and Razer Partners), with the 120Hz section only having enough space to show four apps at a time. Currently, the number of games that supports Razer’s boosted refresh rates is closer to 30, but it’s hard to know which ones are which because there’s no way to dig deeper. Those 120Hz games should be front and center instead of restricted to a small handful, as Razer’s screen is still the most defining component on the device.The Razer Phone 2 isn’t for everyone, and that’s OK. You need to love big phones, enjoy the  dumb fun that is RGB lighting, and critically, be able to appreciate the impact of that 120Hz display. But thanks to extra work on its speaker, screen, and cameras, the Razer Phone 2 is a much more accommodating and well-rounded device to live with, so long as you can stomach that $800 asking price, Razer’s second effort is something that’s better for both normies and gamers.Android 8.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 • 8GB of RAM • 64/129GB of storage • microSD card slot • 5.7-inch 2560 x 1440 120Hz LCD screen • IP67 water-resistance • USB-C port • Qi wireless charging • bundled 3.5mm jack • 8-MP selfie cam • dual 12-MP rear cams (with 2x zoom) • Bluetooth 5.0 • 4,000 mAh battery • available in gloss black or satin black"
65,Oppo FindX,https://gizmodo.com/this-gorgeous-all-screen-phone-shows-how-the-notch-dies-1829737051,"When you look at the design of Apple, Samsung, and Google’s latest phones, there’s very little to distinguish this year’s crop from 2017’s has-beens. Meanwhile, outside of the big three, every other phone maker seemed content to jump on the notched screen bandwagon and settle for similarly iterative aesthetics. And just when it seemed like 2018 was going to be a truly boring year for phones, Oppo went and made the Find X, a device that simultaneously shows smartphone creativity isn’t dead and buries the idea that there’s no way to avoid those stupid screen cutouts.From top to bottom, the Find X is a vision of elegant simplicity. Its tapered glass sides look and feel great, while the thin black outline that runs along the outside of the display highlights all that unblemished screen real estate like a nice frame on an even better painting. Even on the back, Oppo strives for subtle sophistication with subdued pops of color hidden beneath smokey glass. The only indication of the Find X’s deeper nerd appeal is a slim, crescent-shaped sliver of plastic where the camera would normally be.All these things work together to ensure that there’s nothing to distract you from the Find X’s screen, which is exactly what you want. Featuring a vivid AMOLED panel with a 2340 x 1080 resolution spread across 6.42-inches, the Find X offers one of the most immersive viewing experiences on smartphone yet. The only minor quibble, and I do mean minor, is that the Find X’s peak brightness of 425 nits is 20 to 30 percent dimmer than what you’d get on a new Samsung Galaxy or iPhone. When indoors or in the shade, this isn’t an issue, but if you spend a lot of time staring at your phone outside, it’s not ideal.To get the real fireworks going, all you need to do is unlock the phone or open the camera app to make the Find X’s motorized camera pop open like the secret entrance to a Bond villain’s hideout. Not only does the hidden camera fulfill its traditional picture-taking duties, because the Find X doesn’t have an onboard fingerprint sensor, it also functions as a face scanner so you don’t have to enter your pin 50 times a day.Now some folks might get annoyed at the half second or so it takes the Find X’s cam to rise up from its hidey hole. But between the wonderfully techy noise of the tiny motor whirring about inside that sounds like the powered CD trays from desktops of yesteryear and the sheer majesty of watching the phone transform on command, every time I needed to use its cameras, the Find X put a smile on my face. Sometimes, it truly is the small things that make you happy.Unfortunately, even with all this geeky goodness, a respectable battery life just shy of 12 hours and specs that include a Snapdragon 845, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (along with an upcoming model with a world’s first 10GB of memory), the Find X’s still has a number of flaws. It’s not officially sold in the U.S., so depending on where you get one, the phone may not have important stuff like the Google Play Store pre-installed, which means you’ll need to sideload the APK file yourself.Oppo’s Color OS is also a bit behind the times since it’s based on Android 8.1 rather than Android 9. But the more frustrating part is that phone comes with an entire folder full of bloatware, and by default, its notifications aren’t set to show anything useful, so you need to go and customize your preferences for each app one by one. Also, for the $925 or so you’ll need to fork over to a third-party reseller just to buy one, the Find X’s lack of wireless charging, microSD card slot and any sort of water resistance are glaring omissions.And remember what I said earlier about the screen sometimes being hard to see outdoors? Well, the Find X’s issues go even further than that because I feel like for people that are even moderately adventurous, this phone is probably a hard pass. Not only have multiple people demonstrated that the Find X’s chassis is more prone to bending than your typical handset, it’s also not very smart, because if you accidentally try to unlock the while it’s in your pocket, the motorized camera will pop out and struggle in frustration for a few seconds before giving up.When the camera is open, you can also lightly shake the phone and hear the pop up slider rattle a bit in its housing. And even though there are cases that work with the Find X, I’d be dubious about any of them being able to provide sufficient protection in the event that the phone gets dropped on its camera. All these things exactly don’t bode well for the Find X’s long-term durability, so here’s hoping they can be refined and improved on future iterations.The image quality from Find X’s cameras are also just OK. The phone never had any trouble recognizing my face when unlocking the phone, but despite offering a whopping 25-MP cam in front and 16-MP and 20-MP cams in back, overall image quality definitely falls short of other devices in this price range.In a head-to-head photo shootout against a Galaxy Note 9 and S9+, the Find X was always a couple steps behind. And while I wouldn’t go so far as to call the Find X’s pictures disappointing, they just consistently lacked that extra level of sharpness and color saturation from pics produced by its competitors.But even with all this, I want to be clear: Flaws and all, the Find X is a captivating device. Oppo could have played it safe and churned out something that may have been more practical or affordable, but it didn’t. Instead, Oppo took a chance, and in a year when people waged countless internet battles over notches versus bezels, the Find X did its own thing. It delivered the all-screen dream. Now, Oppo has something innovative and unique to build upon. And even when you consider that Samsung could debut a bendable screen phone before the end of the year, there’s no question the Oppo Find is one of the most important smartphones of the year.Color OS running Android 8.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 • 8GB of RAM • 128GB of storage • 6.42-inch 2340 x 1080 AMOLED display • 25-MP front-facing pop up cam • 16-MP rear cam • 20-MP secondary cam with 2x zoom • USB-C • 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac wi-fi • Bluetooth 5.0 • 3,730 mAh battery • 6.17 x 2.92 x 037 inches • 6.56 ounces • GSM only"
66,Pixel 3,https://gizmodo.com/google-pixel-3-review-the-other-way-to-make-a-killer-p-1829749807,"The history of smartphone improvement has largely relied on companies cramming faster or more powerful components into the now ubiquitous glass slabs we carry around. But the Pixel 3 is something else. Instead of focusing on things like a brighter screen, tons of RAM, or multiple rear cameras, almost all of the Pixel 3's advantages come from a software-first mindset. This results in a smarter, more intuitive experience that feels very different from the hardware-driven approaches employed by many of Google’s competitors. And while this isn’t Google’s first attempt at something like this, this third Pixel (we evaluated both it and the Pixel 3 XL) is the device that really pulls all of Google’s efforts together and makes it feel special.For those unfamiliar with the latest version of Android 9 Pie, Google’s mobile OS is what ties everything together. Clean and unfettered by add-ons or extra BS, Android on the Pixel 3 feels fast and snappy unlike anything else, though it’s difficult to say if that is simply the result of speedier animations or superior software optimization. Then you add on things like Google’s Living Wallpapers (which are endlessly entertaining), features from previous Pixels like Google’s Now Playing song ID feature, and the new stuff like Call Screen. You end up with one of, if not the most considered out-of-the-box smartphones experiences, no customizing required. In fact, Google’s Call Screen feature, which lets the Google Assistant intercept phone spam, may be the most important development since caller ID.But nowhere is Google’s software prowess more evident than with the Pixel 3's cameras, which largely eschew the current trend of cramming as many sensors and lenses onto a phone as possible in favor of sophisticated computational photography. For the rear camera, this means that in everyday situations, the Pixel 3's lone 12-MP camera often has an edge over Apple’s iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy in terms of colors and sharpness. And when it comes to things like cityscapes, Google’s HDR+ mode is especially engaging as it merges multiple frames and exposures together to produce shots with more detail in bright spots and richer colors and shady areas, often defying what you think is possible from a smartphone camera.There’s also the new Top Shot feature that uses machine learning to pick out bad shots where someone is blinking and suggest something better. And while it is a somewhat niche ability, when it works and you figure out how to tell that it’s on (make sure the Motion toggle is turned on), Top Shot plus Google’s gif-like Motion photos, burst mode, Photobooth mode, and AR-powered Playground mode means that there’s always fun to be had when taking pictures. (More on Top Shot way below.)I also love the Pixel 3's front cameras, which take the phone’s HDR processing and combines with it a second 8-MP camera to marry the best of what software and hardware can offer. That’s because as long as you’re not afraid of letting blemishes show, the Pixel 3's selfies are mystifyingly sharp in a way that often makes images from other $1,000 phones look bad. And when you want to snap a group selfie instead of a personal one, the Pixel 2's second cam lets you capture the same shockingly detailed images with a wide-angle field of view.As for the Pixel 3's general design, aside from the Pixel 3 XL’s unmistakable notch (which I’ve taken to calling “the bathtub”), the physical dimensions of both the 5.5-inch Pixel 3 and 6.3-inch Pixel 3s have changed so little that Google’s new official cases fit just as well on last year’s phones. Instead, Google worked on improving the Pixel’s build by adding new IP68 water-resistance, moving the volume rocker to the right to create a completely unblemished left side, and installing a new one-piece glass back.It not only increases durability when compared to the metal and glass construction of the Pixel 2, but the micro-etched soft-touch finishon its bottom two-thirds is something that begs you not to put a case on the phone. Google even paid attention to little details like painting the inside of the phone’s USB-C port black and adding a splash of color to the Clearly White and Not Pink models’ power button. (Also, if you want to be accurate, Not Pink should really be called Sometimes Pink.)Inside, the Pixel 3 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, which puts it on the same playing field as every other high-end Android phone. However, the Pixel 3's 4GB of RAM and 64GB or 128GB storage feel a bit skimpy for a phone that starts at $800. That isn’t to say the phone needs more memory, but when it comes to value, not having extra RAM, or a microSD card slot for the option to tack on even more storage feels bad for a flagship device. Thankfully, Google didn’t ax the phone’s dual front-facing speakers, which are way louder than before, and when combined with Google’s Pixel Stand wireless charger, lets the Pixel 3 double as a mini smart speaker/home hub combo.That said, in terms of usefulness, one of the standard Pixel 3's biggest upgrades is a larger 2,915 mAh battery that lasted 10 hours and 50 minutes on our rundown test, a big jump up from the paltry 8:59 the Pixel 2 managed last year. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said of the Pixel 3 XL whose 3,430 mAh battery is actually slightly smaller than what you get in a Pixel 2 XL, which resulted in the Pixel 3 XL’s longevity increasing by less than 10 minutes to 11 hours and 24 minutes.And even though I’ve had the Pixel 3 for less than a week, the phone has made a lasting impression. Google’s dedication to software excellence is something that I’d say has finally surpassed the iPhone when it comes to being the simplest, most no-nonsense handset, particularly for the less technically inclined crowd. More often than not, the Pixel 3 is thoughtful, and presents you with the tools and info you want, and streamlines the process so that accessing them isn’t a hassle. However, I’d be remiss not to mention the downsides of Google’s game plan.The first and most obvious case are features like Top Shot mode. The Pixel’s software makes it hard to tell if the feature is working because it’s linked to the camera’s seemingly unrelated Motion setting, which can be set to off, auto, and on, with auto and on potentially giving you different results. But the settings complications don’t end there, because controls for major features like HDR+ aren’t shown by default. That means out of the box, you can’t actually turn on the phone’s HDR+ enhanced mode, which is very different from standard HDR+, and to even see the option in the main camera UI, you need to go into the camera’s advanced settings and enable the HDR+ control. Since the Pixel’s HDR+ is the best and most important part of its picture taking process, it shouldn’t be this difficult to turn on.But the true plight of a software-first mindset is that it can often feel like the user experience is never fully complete. Currently, the Pixel 3 is missing Duplex, Google’s AI-powered phone reception feature that can book appointments or make reservations over the phone on its own, as well as Night Sight mode, which is a special setting dedicated to capturing challenging low-light pictures. It’s unclear when they will be available. These are two major things Google teased at the Pixel 3's launch event, and in the case of Night Sight mode, it’s an even bigger bummer, because as is, the Pixel 3 often struggles in very low-light situations.And then there’s the Pixel 3's big what if: How much better could the Pixel 3 be if Google cared a little more about both hardware and software? On the standard Pixel 3, its bezels look oversized and slightly wasteful compared to even 18-month old phones like the Galaxy S8, while the bathtub notch and big chin on the Pixel 3 XL appear even clunkier. Also how about those cameras.With the inclusion of a new dual-cam system in front, Google clearly understands the value of having multiple cameras, and yet the camera in back doesn’t get any extra help. That’s frustrating because even though the Pixel’s Super Res Zoom feature is fine, it’s still not as good as a real 2x optical lens. There’s also a small concern regarding quality control because after turning them on for the first time, I noticed that the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL’s OLED screens featured noticeably different color temperatures, which only gets worse the more off-center you are.Google says some variation between displays is a normal part of the manufacturing process, which is true. But this is the second year in a row this has happened with Pixel devices. I can’t remember ever seeing such a big discrepancy when it comes to the displays on flagship Apple and Samsung handsets.However, don’t let these things distract you from what Google has accomplished. The Pixel 3 more than any phone before shows an almost Nintendo-like philosophy where it’s not the device’s specs or hardware that matter most, but the overall user experience. And on the Pixel 3, Google has taken its software and made it king, solving problems and preventing others with intelligence and good design.Android 9.0 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 • 4GB of RAM • 64GB or 128GB of storage • 5.5-inch FH+ OLED Display/6.3-inch QHD+ OLED display • dual 8-MP front cams • 12.2-MP rear cam • IP68 water resistance • Qi wireless charging • dual front-facing speakers • Bluetooth 5.0 • USB 3.1 Type-C port • 2.915 mAh battery/3,430 mAh battery • 5.7 x 2.7 x 0.3-inches/6.2 x 3.0 x 0.3-inches - 148 grams/184 grams • available in just black, clearly white, not pink"
67,LG 5,https://gizmodo.com/lgs-5-camera-phone-offers-a-snapshot-of-the-incredible-1829488124,"If the new LG V40 was a person, it would almost certainly be an AV nerd. On the outside, it’s dressed in a rather drab, but not offensive outfit. Inside, it’s got some serious camera talent.By building on the success of the Huawei P20 Pro, LG’s latest flagship has upped the number of cameras you can cram into a single phone from four to five, with a dual 8-MP/5-MP selfie cam setup in front, and a trio of cameras in the back. It’s kind of funny because it seems like just yesterday, people were balking at phones with dual rear cams since they went mainstream on phones like the LG G5, Huawei P9 and iPhone 7 Plus. But in the space of a year the speed of innovation has really picked up, and with devices like Nokia’s rumored penta-cam device potentially coming soon, we’re basically living through a camera stacking arms race, and I’m all about it. Thanks to all this camera trickery, the V40 delivers one of the most well-rounded audiovisual toolkits on the market. Do you want depth of field effects on both sides of the phone? You got it. How about three different fields of view for capturing all sorts of scenes? No problem. Maybe even a tool to make your own cinemagraphs? The V40 has that too. And to make sure all of the V40’s lenses play nicely with each other, LG even tinkered with its camera software to ensure you don’t forget how useful all that glass is, and maybe even teach you how to use them a little better.In back, those three digital eyes include a 12-MP f/1.5 main cam, a 16-MP f/1.9 super wide-angle cam, and a 12-MP f/2.4 telephoto cam with a 2x zoom. That means there’s a lens for almost every situation, and they are all quite sharp.In a head-to-head shootout against a Galaxy Note 9, which is LG’s biggest rival in terms of price, features, and hometown bragging rights, the V40’s shot of a bowl of beef noodle soup was just as good, if not a tiny bit better than what the Samsung captured. (You can see all these image comparisons in a gallery below.) There are minor differences in color, which is to be expected from phones made by different companies, and if you zoom in to pixel peep, the V40’s shot actually looks a little sharper and features better details on the meat. Next, when I tested out the V40’s new 2x zoom at a recent CS:Go tournament, while the Note 9’s shot did a better cutting down the scene’s excessive blue color cast, the V40 wasn’t far off. And when I snapped a quick pic of a happy little turtle, the V40 was once again quite close, featuring detailed textures on the rock and reptile, though the V40’s shot overall does appear slightly overexposed.Finally, in low-light, the V40 once again kept up with the Note 9. However, if you look zoom in close and look at the candle and the silverware, you can see where the Note 9 has a small advantage in detail and noise reduction. To be clear, while I think the Note 9 offers just a little more when it comes to image quality, the V40 ain’t no slouch either.But we’re not done yet, because there’s still the V40’s super wide-angle camera to consider—something the Note 9 doesn’t even have—which lets you capture expansive view of buildings or sports events that you might otherwise miss. And then there’s the tweaking LG has done to the V40’s camera app. Now, if you want to get a preview of what each lens is seeing, you can just long-press on the three icons at the top of the screen to get a live view of each camera’s field of view. And if you still can’t decide which lens is best from that, you can simply turn on Triple Shot and have the V40 take a picture with all three lenses in a (somewhat) quick succession. Unfortunately, because you can’t really pick your focus area in triple shot like you can normally, the feature is mostly best used as a guide to help compose more pics later. There’s also the V40’s new Cine Shot mode, which lets you turn videos into endlessly looping movie, or what aficionados tend to call cinemagraphs. All you have to do is take a quick three-second video, highlight the specific section of the scene you want to keep in motion by painting over it with your finger, and that’s it, you’re done. Sometimes, there are issues where the motion looks jumpy or the gif doesn’t loop perfectly, but even so, turning the process of making your own cinemagraphs from sometimes that could take multiple hours into one that takes less than 15 seconds is a lot of fun. That said, I do wish there were a few more options in Cine Shot like being able to set the video capture to something longer than three seconds.And on top of all the new stuff, there’s still all of LG’s previous camera features to consider, like its AI Cam mode that can recognize various objects and scene and then use that info to automatically adjust picture settings, a new version of Google Lens that works in real-time instead of requiring you snap a picture first, and fancy tricks like LG’s Cine Video that lets you smoothly zoom onto a specific subject like real videographer.Cameras aside, the V40’s general specs are pretty solid too. It comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a microSD card slot, water resistance, wireless charging, and a fingerprint sensor. It even has a headphone jack— something you only seem to find on budget devices and phones from South Korea nowadays—which works in tandem with a built-in 32-bit quad DAC to deliver some seriously nice sounding wired audio.The V40’s big 6.4-inch OLED display is also quite bright (it hit 598 nits on our equipment, higher than both the Note 9 and iPhone XS), and doesn’t show any weird tinting or banding that we’ve seen on some of LG’s previous screens. And despite having an average-sized 3,300 mAh battery, the V40 did just fine on our rundown test with a time 10 hours and 42 minutes. Sure, that’s noticeably shorter than an iPhone XS Max (13:07) or a Note 9 (14:11), but its only half an hour shy of a standard iPhone XS (11:11).However, what isn’t so nice is that out of the box, the V40 features Android 8.1 instead of Android 9, and LG isn’t saying when an update might arrive. LG is also weirdly trying to push how thin and light the V40 is compared some other big name phones. I thought we were past this. At 5.96 ounces, the V40 does weigh about an ounce less than phones with similar size displays, but I’m kind of struggling to care. I’ve never thought once that a phone is too heavy to use, but maybe that’s just me.Meanwhile, the V40’s design is quite plain, sporting the same glass sandwich design found on every handset made in the last 18 months. LG even avoided turning the V40’s notch into a little face by positioning the two selfie cams next to each other instead of putting the earpiece in the middle. It’s like LG was trying to avoid giving this phone a personality of any kind. As for the notch itself, LG’s default UI does a good job of blurring the line between the cutout and screen, but if you don’t mind showing off the notch there are some fun multi-colored borders you can use instead. The V40 also retains the dedicated Google Assistant button LG debuted on the G7, though after using it again six months later, I still question how useful it really is.My biggest issue with the V40, though, is its price. Listed at around $950 (depending on where you buy it), it feels like LG may have set its sights a bit too high. Yes, all those cameras are cool and each one has its use, and its specs are fine for a flagship, but when it comes to making its price feel justified, I think the V40 falls a little short. Give me another 2GB of RAM, more built-in storage, or hell, even a stylus, because even though it has more cameras than a $1,000 Galaxy Note 9, Samsung’s big, expensive handset feels like a better value. And for this much money, a premium handset absolutely needs to look as cool as all the tech it has stuffed inside. Sadly, the V40 doesn’t quite get there either.But if you don’t mind trying to find a way to get a sweeter deal, like waiting a few months for the price to drop, or opting for the V40’s surprisingly good pre-order bundle which includes a free DJI Osmo Mobile 2 and a 256GB microSD card, the payoff could be worth it. For all the people who say the most important thing about their next phone is getting a better camera, between the V40’s five cameras and all of its nifty camera tricks, LG’s latest phone has that covered. And if you don’t go for the V40, just know that LG’s multi-cam madness will probably be coming soon to every other high-end handset too.Android 8.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 • 6.4-inch 3120 x 1440 OLED display • HDR 10 support • 6GB of RAM • 64GB of storage • microSD card slot • triple rear cameras (12-MP f/1.5 main cam, 16-MP f/1.9 107 degree wide-angle cam, 12-MP f/2.4 2x zoom cam) • dual selfie cams (8-MP f/1.9 main cam, 12-MP f/2.4 45 degree wide-angle cam) • 3,300 mAh battery, USB-C port • 3.5mm port • wireless charging • 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac wi-fi • Bluetooth 5.0 • NFC • IP68 dust/water resistance • 32-bit quad dac • 6.25 x 2.98 x 0.3-inches • 5.96 ounces • available in black or Moroccan blue"
68,iPhone XS,https://gizmodo.com/the-iphone-xs-is-forever-1829305262,"I’m sick of buying iPhones. For the past decade, I’ve been buying them and loving them and breaking them and losing them and replacing them and, when September comes along, upgrading them. Last year, it cost me over $1,200 to get an iPhone X, and against my better judgment, I’m very seriously considering spending even more money to get the iPhone XS. But it’s not because the iPhone XS is wildly better. It’s not. I want to buy the iPhone XS (prices start at $1,000) so that I can stop buying iPhones for a while. This thing feels future-proof, and yes, I’m aware of how dumb that sounds. However, when you consider the sheer horsepower of the new A12 Bionic processor paired with a better camera system, the improved guts should let me handle my day-to-day phoning with a little bit more ease. On top of that, some tweaks to the original iPhone X design also promise to make the iPhone XS more durable. Oh, and there’s also the iPhone XS Max which is the basically the exact same phone as the iPhone XS, except it’s bigger and more expensive (prices start at $1,100). This all amounts to a pretty boring iPhone update. It’s an “S” year, so we should have expected some spec bumps and small tweaks. The thing is, if you’re someone who likes to keep your device for more than a year or two, the iPhone XS is damn fine investment. If you’re upgrading from an iPhone 7 or 8, the iPhone XS will feel like a revelation. If you already own an iPhone X, well, you already own a great phone. The iPhone XS is better, and I’ll bet you a buffalo head nickel it will have a longer lifespan. That’s what I’m most excited about.A few years ago, former Gizmodo editor Brian Barrett wrote a post about how iPads are forever. Apple wasn’t selling as many as it used to, because Apple had made the iPad so good that people didn’t need to upgrade. And now I wonder if that’s what’s happening with the iPhone. The devices are more expensive, but they also seem more lasting. Is the iPhone XS the first iPhone you’ll want to keep for five years? I think it is.Following tradition, Apple didn’t change much about the design of the iPhone XS. It looks like an iPhone X! However, there are a few seemingly minor differences that make it a better device.Let’s start with the size. Again, the iPhone XS is just like the iPhone X. Both devices have a 5.8-inch OLED display and are 7.7mm-thick. That’s slightly thicker than the iPhone 7, which is 7.1mm-thick, and the iPhone 8, which is 7.3mm-thick. Like the iPhone X, the iPhone XS footprint is slightly taller and slightly wider than an iPhone 8. For the iPhone XS Max, all those numbers edge up. The device itself is almost exactly the same size as an iPhone 8 Plus, but the iPhone XS Max is a full ounce heavier than the Plus at 7.34 ounces. So the Max is big, but if you’ve been using a Plus, it won’t feel much different in your hand or take up more room in your pocket. The 6.4-inch display will feel expansive, though. Using it feels a little different, too, because Apple simply stretched iOS out to fit the bigger canvas. In other words, you’re seeing what you would normally see on a Plus screen except it’s stretched out. While you can’t necessarily see it like you see a difference in size, the iPhone XS glass is new. Apple says the device has the “most durable glass ever on a smartphone.” This is an interesting claim, especially since a ton of people said that the iPhone X was “Apple’s most fragile handset ever.” We didn’t do any drop or scratch tests with the new device, and the reports from those that did seem mixed, so far. However, as someone who babied an iPhone X for a year but still ended up with a screen full of scratches and a network of cracks on the back glass, any improvements to the device’s durability are very welcome.Another difference that you can see is the addition of two new antenna lines. That’s because the iPhone XS includes 4x4 MIMO technology for faster LTE transmission. (The iPhone X and iPhone 8 had 2x2 MIMO.) The iPhone XS also supports QAM and LAA radio technologies for better connectivity. What this alphabet soup of standards adds up to is zippier uploads and downloads. In our tests, the iPhone XS smoked the iPhone X, delivering speeds that were two- to three-times faster on the Verizon network.As it’s an “S” iPhone, the iPhone XS is all about the guts. What I found particularly interesting, however, is that the improvements inside the iPhone XS aren’t necessarily obvious. This is certainly true of the processor, which seems like it’s designed to be extremely powerful and support apps that have not yet been built. I also think it’s partially true for the camera, because you might have to learn new ways to take photos in order to appreciate some of the coolest features. But before we dive too deep into those two things—which are the headline upgrades on the iPhone XS—a quick note about Face ID. The Face ID hardware is the same, but Apple says it tweaked the algorithms to make it faster. And indeed, it is faster. This was actually the first thing I noticed when I started testing the iPhone XS. It seemed to unlock immediately, and I loved it, because it always felt like I needed to stare at the iPhone X for a couple seconds before it unlocked. In a side-by-side test, the iPhone XS unlocks a full beat faster than the iPhone X. I guess over the course of my life, those extra seconds add up.Faster is sort of the overarching theme of what the iPhone XS does. Apple says  the A12 Bionic’s CPU is up to 15 percent faster than the A11 Bionic, and the GPU is up to 50 percent faster. Our synthetic benchmark tests did show a solid improvement, although our day-to-day testing suggested something even more interesting. The A12 Bionic seems like V12 engine running on six cylinders. Right now, you’re only tapping into a fraction of the chip’s power, and even that feels delightfully powerful compared to earlier iPhones. Star Walk 2 is buttery smooth on the iPhone XS, while it has a tendency to lag on the iPhone X. Fortnite loads about 15 seconds faster on the iPhone XS than on the iPhone X and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds only utilizes half as much of the GPU on the iPhone XS than it does on the iPhone X. That means it should be prepared for a future of better graphics, perhaps one that the developers haven’t even dreamed up yet. Apple’s new A12 Bionic chip feels like more chip than I need right now, which is not a bad thing. It seems like it’s designed not only to better handle the apps of right now but also encourage developers to push its limits with the apps of tomorrow. It also does all of this without sacrificing battery life. Both the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max performed as advertised with over 11 hours and over 13 hours of video playback, respectively. These all very good things, if you’re like me and thinking about investing $1,000 in a new phone and want that phone to last you a few years. And then there’s that camera module. It’s neither inside nor outside the phone, which is still a little bit annoying if you want your phone to sit flat on a tabletop without a case. But that’s not the point. The iPhone XS camera is better than the iPhone X camera. Central to the better camera system is a bigger sensor. Apple said the wide-angle camera comes with pixels that are 32-percent larger than those on the iPhone X. You really can see what a difference that extra sensor size makes when taking low-light photos, too. This street scene in Brooklyn looks fine in a photo taken with the iPhone X. The details of the road and cars show up under the street lights, but the illuminated restaurant sign behind it is blown out. When you look at the same shot taken with the iPhone XS, there’s simply more there, including the letters on the sign.There’s more to this than a bigger sensor. The A12 Bionic also plays a big role in enabling the camera to capture and process a lot of information very quickly. This is what makes the new Smart HDR feature possible, and I’d argue that we can see the letters on that sign because of Smart HDR, which Apple says combines the best features of several different exposures to increase the dynamic range of photos. Several of us at Gizmodo tested the limits of Smart HDR, and we agreed that it’s good at keeping image highlights from seeming quite so blown out. It won’t rescue photos taken in too much darkness, but it will allow you to see more details when taking images in overly bright environments or taking images that have big blotches of brightness, like our restaurant sign above. The iPhone XS is also just generally better at dealing with highlights and shadows than other iPhones are, but its performance isn’t flawless. This is most obvious in situations with more challenging lighting, like the backlit building with the dinosaur painting below. This is a tricky shot. The photo taken with the iPhone 8 Plus (left) basically shits the bed, blowing out the sky and failing to produce much detail of the brick building. The photo taken with the iPhone X (center) does a better job but looks washed out. The photo taken with the iPhone XS Max (right) reproduces textures on the building in a very realistic way, although it does lose some of the details in the bright clouds. It’s the best photo out of the three, but it’s still not perfect.Another tough situation that the iPhone XS handles well is very high contrast images, especially those with extreme bright spots like the reflections in the photos below. Check out this image of a shining copper still. Its textured exterior is a big part of what makes it interesting, but the photo taken with the iPhone X fails to preserve that texture. It’s just blown out in certain spots.You might not even notice that you’re losing detail until you see the exact same photo taken with the iPhone XS. Instead of the highlights getting blown out and turning into a glossy mess, this image preserves the delicate textures:Honestly, most of the photos I took with the iPhone XS look good. Which is to say, the camera is definitely good enough for most people. The new Portrait Mode and its adjustable depth of field is especially great. This feature allows you to adjust the look of the bokeh in Portrait Mode shots, after they’ve been captured. You can make the background behind the focal point completely crisp or you can make it super blurry using a new little slider that’s labelled with f-stops in the Camera app’s edit mode. You’re not actually changing the f-stop, since it’s a software trick. Nevertheless, it gives you some more flexibility with photo editing. The effect looks a little fake if you overdo it, in my opinion, but it’s something I like about the new camera.Portrait Mode is better in general. In the past, I’ve typically dealt with a lot of weird artifacts and glitches with Portrait Mode in the past, usually to do with some shortcoming in distinguishing the subject of the portrait from the background. It’s hard to say how  better the iPhone XS at dealing with these challenges, but the fact that you can now adjust the bokeh effect is a useful tool in this respect. For example, if the edges of a subject  in a Portrait Mode photo look too blurry or even just not quite right, the magical little slider can tone down the bokeh effect and make the image look more realistic. It’s also handy if you simply want some options for tweaking these kinds of photos, options that simply do not exist with other iPhones. The f-stop slider feature is not available when trying to edit Portrait Mode photos on older iPhone models.Oh, and if you’re hungry for more examples of what the iPhone XS can do, here’s a whole gallery of them. All of these photos are unedited except for some basic cropping.Let me be blunt with you. I want to buy the iPhone XS, but I’m not sure that I will right now. At the very least, I’m going to wait a few weeks to read more about the durability issues and to test out the iPhone XR. But it feels like I want to buy an iPhone XS and then not even think about buying an iPhone until after the 2020 presidential elections. That’s because the promise of longevity is what make the iPhone XS feel special. There’s nothing new about the design, which is fine with me because the design is terrific. Performance-wise, the iPhone XS is just marginally better than the iPhone X. It is tremendously better than the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 7, however, the iPhone XS also promises to remain excellent for several years to come. At least that’s how it feels.A couple weeks ago, I wrote a blog about which iPhone XS you should buy and recommended the 256GB iPhone XS in space grey on Verizon. My review unit was the exact same model except it came in the new gold color. I liked the gold! And I’d also stand behind my original recommendation. The smaller iPhone XS with the mid-range storage is probably the best phone for most people. It’s the one I’ll buy, if I finally decide to buy one. And if you really want the jumbo dude, go ahead and get the iPhone XS Max. I hope you love it.The fact of the matter is that I want to love this new iPhone. I want to spend years of my life with this new iPhone. I want this new iPhone to last forever. Because wouldn’t that be the best? You spend a grand on one phone, and you don’t have to spend any more grands again. That’s not going to happen any time soon, but at least, the iPhone XS feels like it will stick around."
69,Galaxy Note 9,https://gizmodo.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-9-is-the-best-big-phone-1828348138,"Since the beginning, the big honking screens on Galaxy Note phones have been their most memorable characteristic. But as the rest of the smartphone world caught onto the jumbo display trend and screen sizes from various makers started to converge around six-inch displays, the throne on which Samsung’s Note phones lorded over lesser devices just didn’t have the same kind of sway. So now, the question is: What’s the purpose of a big ass flagship handset in 2018, especially one that starts at pearl-clutching price of $1,000?The answer is to give you everything. It’s as if on the Note 9, Samsung took the ridiculous excess of a stretch Ferrari limo, added back in the performance that prancing horse logo is supposed to deliver, and then went over everything with the kind of attention normally reserved for overly-tweezed Michelin star meals. So instead of getting what would otherwise be an S9+ with an S-Pen jammed up its butt, the Note 9 represents a top-to-bottom improvement on how much you can cram in a phone and what it can do.The Note 9 now sports a 6.4-inch display (0.2-inches larger than the S9+) that manages to look even more vibrant and colorful than any other phone screen on the market, which is quite impressive since Samsung is already the manufacturer responsible for the displays in its Galaxy phones and the iPhone X. Meanwhile on the inside, Samsung provides 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage standard, with the option of upgrading to an even higher-specced model with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for around $1,250 (depending on where you buy it). That means better multitasking due to less closing of background apps, and the freedom to download and install whatever you want without fear of running out of room. Add in a microSD card slot that can handle another 512GB or more, and you’re looking at a phone that can hold north a 1TB. Yes, this is way more than anyone actually needs, but when you’re paying this much, there’s no reason to skimp.Samsung also paid attention to little things like Note 9's thermal management, and installed carbon fiber heat spreaders that are three times larger than the ones in the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8. That means in addition to letting the Note 9's Snapdragon 845 processor run more freely, resulting in slightly higher scores in Geekbench 4 (9,012 for the Note 9 vs 8,414 for S9+), the Note 9 can also sustain that performance for longer periods of time.So after running my initial benchmarks, I tested this by taking the Note 9 and a Galaxy S9+ out for spin involving a few rounds of Fortnite, repeated runs of 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme graphics test, and downloading a few torrents, all back to back. Basically, anything I could to stress out the phone and turn up the heat. Then, I ran Geekbench one more time to see how much each phone’s performance had been impacted. The Note 9 fell a bit down to 8,053 (a drop of around 10 percent), while the Galaxy S9+ suffered significantly more, with its score falling over 25 percent to 6,171. That said, it seems graphics performance doesn’t benefit quite as much from the Note 9's improved thermal management, because when I ran 3DMark Slingshot Extreme Unlimited one more time, both phones posted nearly equivalent marks of 4,974 for the Note 9, and 4,923 for the S9+, down from 5,021 and 5,033 respectively.I do wish Samsung had done something, anything to change up the Note 9's design. Aside from a selection of new colors including ocean blue and lavender purple (which is essentially the same as the lilac paint job seen on the Galaxy S9), the main difference between the Note 9 and last year’s model is an almost imperceptible increase in heft.Physically, the Note 9's 12-MP dual rear cameras are also more or less unchanged, though Samsung says it has rebuilt the phone’s image processing from the ground up, while also adding two new features to the phone’s camera app. The first is Samsung’s scene optimizer, which like we’ve seen on previous Huawei and LG phones, uses image recognition to detect objects in your shot, before adjusting the camera settings accordingly. At this point, the idea of using machine learning to help achieve optimal results isn’t exactly new, but the practice  does help improve the quality of some of the most frequently snapped types of pics. However, to all those people who continue to swear up and down about how the Pixel 2 is clearly the best smartphone camera, just stop it, it’s not. Between the iPhone X, the Pixel 2, the Huawei P20 Pro and the Galaxy Note 9, there isn’t a single smartphone that beats out its competition 100 percent of the time, or depending on the match up, even 75 percent of the time. I will say, that with Google’s advanced HDR+ processing, the Pixel 2 tends to has a slight advantage over Note 9 in bright, daytime situations. However, in low light, I ran into multiple situations where the Note 9 out shot a Pixel 2 XL.Take for example a shot of a nearby church in which the Note 9's pic is superior across the board with richer colors, less noise, sharper details, and better exposure. And with those spotlights pointing up on the sides, this scene wasn’t really all that dark. In another photo of a diner shut down for the night, the Note 9 once again captured a significantly better looking image, with much less grain and clearer objects, especially as you look into the background. In both situations, the Note 9's scene optimizer correctly identified that it was a nighttime pic, which when combined with the phone’s wider max aperture of f/1.5 resulted in wins for Samsung.But what impressed me the most was when I tried to take a shot in the rain. This time, both phones captured fantastic looking shots that if I had seen them more than a year ago, I would have been floored to learn they came from phone cameras. Picking between the two is basically a toss up. The Pixel 2 XL did a better job of preserving the texture on the concrete parking garage in the back, while the Note 9 did more to eliminate the heavy yellow tint in the center of the frame, and something the Pixel 2 can’t match is the 2x optical zoom on the Note 9's second rear camera. However, the Note 9 wasn’t always impeccable. Note the second to last image in the slide show above. You can see  how the Note 9 absolutely missed on both white balance and at recognizing a piece of cake.Flaw detection, noting when an image is bad and telling you to try the shot again, is a nice bonus, but I think Samsung could have taken the feature even further. Right now, the Note 9 can tell if a picture is blurry, the lens is smudged, the photo is backlit, or if someone blinked while taking the picture, and then alert you that you might want to try again to avoid ending up with an unsatisfactory pic. But what I’d really like to see is for the phone to take that info, and then adjust its camera settings like it does with scene optimizer so the Note 9 could increase  shutter speed to cancel out motion blur, or turn on the flash to  prevent backlighting from making your subject look underexposed. Flaw detection is an interesting trick, but after using it, I’m already seeing how it could be so much better. When it comes to the Note 9's other signature feature—the S-Pen—Samsung thankfully hasn’t forgotten to include its usual assortment of Air Command abilities. It has all sorts of functions including built-in translation, one of the simplest methods of making gifs on a phone, and a myriad of ways to make sketching on pretty much anything a blast. But Samsung didn’t stop there, because now the S-Pen comes with Bluetooth low-energy so it can be used like a tiny remote. In the Note 9's settings, the S-Pen’s button can be configured to open a number of apps, while also performing additional contextual functions like long-pressing to switch between front and rear cameras when taking pictures, or a quick press to simply snap a pic without needing to actually touch the phone. And while it might sound like a small thing, I really like the S-Pen’s ability to pause music or YouTube videos with a single press, just because now, switching between working and relaxing, when necessary, is that much faster. And for high-powered business types, the ability to control Powerpoint slides using the S-Pen is another helpful skills. No more relying on other people’s unfamiliar equipment or a second person to make sure your presentation goes smoothly—you’ve already got what you need.This brings me to the Note 9's Dex mode—the mode that lets you connect the phone to a monitor and use like a PC. It has been refined and is now even easier to setup. Unlike previous attempts at turning a phone into desktop on the S8 and S9, the Note 9 only needs a simple USB-C to HDMI adapter to take advantage of a nearby external monitor. Officially, Samsung says its $50 dongle and older Dex pads are the only fully supported ways to do this, but technically any adapter should work. From there, you just need to connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, and then all of a sudden, you have a full desktop environment to play around with. If you ask me though, Dex mode is actually the best way to clown on people in Fortnite, particularly other mobile players who are forced to fight back using sad, unresponsive touchscreen controls (though to do this, you will need an adapter with more ports that lets you hook up wired peripherals). And while Huawei’s P20 Pro offers similar desktop functionality via a USB-C to HDMI adapter, Dex mode’s better UI is truly the closest any company has ever come to achieving the dream of having a phone that can transform into a real computer at a moment’s notice. And even though I know it would probably result in a massive waste of money, I kind of wish Samsung would make a laptop dock for the Note 9 like HP did for the Elite x3 or Motorola for the weird and wonderful Atrix.Ok, so this is all fun and great, but what about the Note 9's battery life? I admit, I may have sandbagged a bit, but I wanted to save the best part for last, because the Note 9's battery life is incredible. With a time of 14 hours and 11 minutes on our rundown test, the Note 9 is the second longest-lasting phone we’ve ever tested, behind only the Asus Zenfone 4 Max— which was a handset designed with only one goal in mind: longevity. Last year, Samsung went with a battery on the Note 8 that was actually 200 mAh smaller than what you got on an S8+. But for 2018, Samsung increased the size of the Note 9's battery by almost 15 percent when compared to the S9+, and it’s made quite a difference.Unfortunately, this also reminds me of the Note 9's biggest flaw: the lack of Android 9 Pie. With the timing of Google’s new OS getting released a few days ahead of the Note 9's debut, I was hoping it meant Samsung’s had worked with Google to get the newest version of Android running on the Note. But instead we get Android 8.1. What a bummer, because aside from handy new additions in Pie like App Actions, better volume controls, and more, the idea of Android 9's Adaptive Battery letting the Note 9 last even longer per charge is tantalizing proposition. And based on the schedule for when the Note 8 got Android 8 Oreo, it’ll be at least a few months before the Note 9 gets Android 9.The one thing I still need more time with is Bixby, because while Samsung showed how its voice assistant has been improved with better natural language recognition and the ability to buy tickets or book a restaurant without needing a specific app, less than a week isn’t enough to see how much smarter it’s gotten. So what does $1,000 really get you? Here goes: The Note 9 boasts the biggest, most captivating screen, blazing performance, top-tier photography, and some of the best battery life you can get in a phone. Then you pile on things like the S-Pen, Dex mode, massive optional storage, more RAM than an average laptop, and important supporting components like a headphone jack, wireless charging, IP68 water resistance, and more, and what you get is big phone that’s at the top of its class. Nothing else out right now has as many tools, tricks or feature as what Samsung smashed into the Note 9. And while its price tag means this isn’t a device for everyone, for the people who want to push the limits of what a phone can really do, the Note 9 is here to give them that opportunity.Android 8.1 Oreo • 6.4-inch 2960 x 1440 Super AMOLED display • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor • 6GB of RAM/128GB of storage (upgradable to 8GB/512GB) • microSD card slot • 8-MP front camera • dual 12-MP rear cameras with a 2x zoom • IP68 water resistance • Qi wireless charging • 4,000 mAh battery • USB 3.1 Type-C port • headphone jack • Bluetooth 5.0 • 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac wifi • 6.37 x 3.01 x 0.35-inches • 7.09 ounces • available in ocean blue and lavender purple in the US, midnight black and copper available internationally"
70,Xperia XZ2,https://gizmodo.com/finally-a-perfect-phone-for-small-hands-1827851267,"Whether it’s because you’ve got small hands, prefer a more pocketable device, or simply don’t care about having a giant display, when it comes to truly small phones, there just aren’t a lot of options. Your choices are essentially the iPhone SE, the standard Pixel 2, and this: the Xperia XZ2 Compact. However, with Apple not having bothered to update the SE in more than two years, and the Pixel 2 having been cursed with a half-assed design that makes it seem like the neglected member of Google’s 2017 offerings, even those handsets have issues. I know small phones aren’t super popular, but it’s almost comical at how little effort companies put into making a modestly-sized devices with competent specs.Thankfully, the XZ2 Compact is the exception to all that, because by taking all the important stuff from the standard XZ2 including its Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, 19-MP rear cam, and microSD card slot, and then putting it inside a petite body with a finger-friendly 5-inch screen, the XZ2 Compact offers the same flagship performance found in other big names handsets and solid camera quality with way less bulk. Sony even made sure to retain the XZ2’s dedicated two-step camera button and dual front facing speakers,  both of which could have been easily axed to save on space or price.Seriously, with so many phones today sporting screens 6-inches or bigger, even I  forget just how nice it is to have a device that doesn’t feel like a burden. The XZ2 Compact is just so chuckable. It basically disappears into bags, and even for people who like their jeans on the embarrassing side of tight. It’s never an issue trying to slip this thing into a pocket. And when you hold it, it feels even better thanks to its curvy, rounded plastic back that makes the phone feel like a well worn ocean pebble while also offering a nice departure from the glass sandwich think seemingly every other phone maker is pushing nowadays. That said, there are a handful of features that didn’t make it on the XZ2 Compact, most notably the ridiculously strong vibration engine from the standard XZ2, which turns everything from a round of Clash Royale to an episode of the Joy of Painting into a hand-rumbling extravaganza. The Compact also lacks wireless charging, has a smaller battery, and while quite diminutive from top to bottom, it’s definitely not slim, as it measures a full half-inch thick.Out of all of these, the smaller battery is probably the change with the biggest impact, because with the 3,180 mAh power pack  in the standard XZ2, it lasted a proficient 10 hours and 42 minutes on our battery rundown test. Meanwhile, the XZ2 Compact’s 2,870 mAh battery lasted a less impressive 8 hours and 45 minutes. That’s not quite short enough to be a deal breaker, as the Pixel 2 didn’t fare that much better with a time of  8:59, but overall longevity is the XZ2’s most glaring shortcoming.And what about pictures? It’s a key feature for a phone—even a small one. And the XZ2 Compact shoots  pretty solid ones. In a head-to-head face off against a Galaxy S9+, the XZ2 Compact produced pics that on occasion sported even richer and more saturated colors, which is really quite impressive. However, in other situations, despite having a higher-resolution 19 megapixel rear camera, details weren’t quite as sharp as I was hoping, and when you zoom into 100 percent, pics from the XZ2 Compact often featured more artifacts and noise than photos taken by the S9+. Yet while I’d still give the overall to Samsung’s phone, it’s hard to be disappointed with what the XZ2 Compact captured either.And finally we get to the XZ2’s secret weapon: its price. At just $600, the XZ2 Compact feels like one of the last bastions of sanity in a world where flagship devices start at $750 and go up quickly from there. Suddenly, a lot of those earlier issues like mediocre battery life and no wireless charging aren’t nearly as annoying. It all makes this phone not only a great pick for people seeking out a smaller a device, but also a damn good value in its own right. And as one last bonus, the Compact also features support for CDMA networks and is even certified for use on Verizon (something its bigger sibling can’t claim). For all the small phone fans out there, Sony’s XZ2 Compact is as good as it gets.Android 8.0  • 5-inch 18:9 2160 x 1080 LCD HDR display • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor •  4GB of RAM • 64GB of storage • microSD card slot • 2870 mAh battery • USB 3.1 Type-C with Qualcomm Quickcharge 3.0 • 5-MP front camera • 19-MP rear camera • dual front-facing stereo speakers • IP65/68 water-resistance • 5.3 x 2.6 x 0.5 inches • 5.9 ounces • available in black, silver, moss green, and coral pink"
71,Alcatel 1X,https://gizmodo.com/the-cost-of-buying-a-100-phone-1827541118,"No one gets a cheap phone because they want to have a sub-par experience filled with stuttering and lagging apps. People get cheap phones because they’re cheap, and usually work just enough to justify the low price point. Take the Alcatel 1X, for example. It’s neither novel nor intriguing. It’s not trying to impress you. Hell, it runs on an operating system designed explicitly for underpowered devices. But it’s $100, and that sure is cheap. Whether you can stomach how cheap it feels is another thing entirely.Right off the bat, the Alcatel 1X looks like the world’s most generic smartphone. On the front is its 5.3-inch 480p display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, giving you more real estate when doing anything unrelated to watching videos. The display’s glass is surprisingly difficult to scroll on, but the rough suede-like finish on the rear of the 1X is surprisingly appealing, even if the fingerprints left on the back after a particularly humid summer day are kind of gross. The rear fingerprint reader was a disappointment more often than not; its poor performance means unlocking the phone with a PIN is easier than using the hit-or-miss biometric tool.It uses a 3.5mm headphone jack and Micro-USB port, which is no doubt a cost-saving measure anyone purchasing the 1X probably won’t mind. The rear 8-megapixel camera and front-facing 5-megapixel camera (which includes a convenient front-facing LED) is predictably sluggish, and the somewhat unresponsive touchscreen means you’ll have more luck snapping a photo with the volume buttons rather than the on-screen shutter button. Please, don’t photograph anything important with this.The 1X’s 1.3GHz Mediatek quad-core processor, made specifically for budget phones, means you shouldn’t expect much in terms of raw power. There’s a surprising amount of stuttering scrolling and dropped frames in apps and games, and Alcatel’s light skinning of the UI doesn’t help. Since it’s lacking in the graphics department, games like Riptide GP2 will run (poorly), while a game like PUBG will let you go through the entire download and update process before telling you your phone is too slow to actually enjoy what it has in store.The hardware leaves a lot to be desired, but the lightweight operating system is brand spankin’ new. It runs the Android Oreo Go edition, which is meant for devices available outside the U.S., primarily for developing countries where people are more likely to purchase inexpensive smartphones compared to the more popular (and pricey) ones from companies like Apple, Google, or Samsung that cost many hundreds of dollars. With a smaller footprint that allows for more internal storage, Android Go recognizes that every megabyte counts, which is why Google created “Go” apps designed to take advantage of the device’s limitations.Still, the Go apps are more like HTML5-based webapps, and apps like Maps are missing key features like turn-by-turn directions, the perfect example of what you lose with a super-budget phone. But as mentioned, many apps not optimized for Android Go run in spectacularly poor fashion on the 1X. And it would be nice to know whether an app can run on the device before you download it rather than afterward.The Alcatel 1X is a cheap smartphone, plain and simple. There are neither bells nor whistles to be had. Even something like eSIM support, a theoretically perfect addition to what one might use as a burner phone abroad, is missing. With an inconsistent fingerprint sensor, low-resolution display, and sluggish camera, the 1X is exactly what you’d expect to get out of a $100 smartphone, and that’s disappointing. Cheap smartphones have come a long way, and for another $150, you can get a smartphone like the Moto G6, a damn good phone worth the extra coin. Of course, if you’re eyeing a $100 phone, spending more may not be an option. And in that case, the Alcatel 1X gets the job done—it has apps, it lets you get online, it has a camera. It makes phone calls! It’s a smartphone at its most basic, and hey, that’s better than nothing."
72,HTC U12+,https://gizmodo.com/i-really-hope-htc-doesnt-go-out-like-this-1827380446,"After years of declining sales, unloading $1 billion worth of patents and personnel to Google, and just recently slashing 25 percent of its global workforce, when it comes to HTC, I got one big question: So what’s left? Sure, HTC may have been able insulate its promising Vive VR business by spinning that department off into a separate company. But as for HTC itself, if all the company has left in the tank is its upcoming crypto phone and this, the new U12+, things aren’t looking good. Initially, when I heard about the U12+, I was optimistic. HTC’s previous flagship phone was one of the biggest sleepers of 2017 thanks to its unique design, the huge 3930 mAh battery in the larger U11+, and a camera that was just as good, if not sometimes better than those found on Samsung’s and Apple’s handsets. And for 2018, it seemed like HTC was going to lean into its innovative side-mounted pressure sensors so you could control even more features with a simple squeeze of your hand.And it some respects, that focus totally paid off, because now in addition to simply squeezing the phone to summon the Google Assistant or whatever else you want, you can also double tap the sides of the phone to go back, squeeze and hold to call up any app of your choosing, or simply grip the phone to prevent it from dimming or rotating the screen without your approval.On top of that, you can even customize what squeezing the phone does contextually within individual apps, so when using the camera app for example, you can squeeze the phone to snap a picture, or squeeze and hold to switch between the phone’s front and rear facing cameras. And because almost all of these functions can be tweaked and adjusted to your liking, the U12+ feels like it has an endless possibilities for  customization. It’s a phone tweaker’s dream. Unfortunately, what HTC forgot to do was increase the sensitivity of the U12+’s pressure sensors, because even when set to their lowest level, actually getting the phone to recognize a squeeze is uncomfortable, and if you squeeze the phone a lot, it might even be a little painful. The phone’s metal sides don’t have any give, so  in order for the handset to recognize your  squeeze, you essentially have to bruise your fingers.But perhaps the U12+’s biggest offense is what HTC did to the phone’s lock and volume “buttons.” That’s because they aren’t actually buttons at all, they’re little bits of raised metal with even more built-in touch sensors. And unlike the Touch ID home “buttons” found on older iPhones, HTC hasn’t really attempted to use high-quality haptics to fool your fingers into thinking they are real. Sure, the “buttons” vibrate when you press them, but they still feel dead, and like the rest of the phone’s squeeze controls, you have to press them harder than you think you should when you want them to work. I really don’t get it, and when you consider the phone’s curvy, almost fluid-like glass back, I think it’s a tragedy that HTC didn’t go all the way and axe the U12+’s buttons entirely in favor of full on touch controls. In a world where phone makers are already trying to eliminate everything on a phone that’s not a screen or camera, that would actually be a bold step into our inevitable all-touch future. Meanwhile, on the inside, the phone’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip, 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and microSD card slot delivers the kind of performance you’d expect from an $800 phone. However, its battery does not. For some reason, after putting a huge 3,950 mAh battery in the U11+, which featured a screen with the same 6-inch dimensions and 2880 x 1440 resolution as the U12+, HTC curiously opted to go with a smaller 3500 mAh this time instead. That means on our rundown test, the U12+ lasted just 8 hours and 1 minute, the shortest time we’ve seen on any phone in 2018, regardless of price, and between three and four hours (or more) shorter than many of its flagship competitors including the Galaxy S9+(12:27) , the Huawei P20 Pro (11:36), or OnePlus 6 (13:03).However, one of the U12+’s redeeming features is its cameras, which have been doubled to include dual 8-MP cams up the front and dual 12-MP cams in back. That means you can shoot portrait mode photos regardless of which side of the phone you’re using, which is nice, but what’s even more impressive is that once again, HTC has managed to keep pace with its mainstream competitors. In daylight, not only did the U12+ capture a challenging shot of a flower in the fading light of a sunset with more accurate white balance, it also refrained from pushing color saturation and sharpness too far like you see in a comparison pic shot by a Galaxy S9+.And in low-light, while the U12+’s pic does look slightly grainier than the S9+’s pic, it doesn’t have any of the greenish cast on the yellow warning track at the bottom of the shot, there’s better detail on the pavers in the road, and clean, bright colors throughout. The S9+’s only other advantage is very slightly better range as seen by more details in the rafters at the top of the building.So in the end, what we’re left with is an incredibly frustrating phone. Aside from its slick transparent glass back, it looks almost exactly the same as last year’s device, and yet, its cameras are even better. Unfortunately, the U12+ has taken a step back in battery life, and while its enhanced pressure sensors  offer even more control and customizability, the performance and execution of HTC’s touch and squeeze functions just isn’t there.But what worries me even more is that with HTC in such trouble financially, it’s possible that the U12+ could be the last flagship phone HTC ever makes. And for a company that’s created a number of all-time great handsets like the T-Mobile G1 (or the HTC Dream as its known outside the U.S.), which was the first phone sold that ran Android, or the legendary HTC One M7, which may have been the best phone of its generation, the death of HTC is a pretty depressing thought. And despite its flaws, the U12+ shows that HTC didn’t sell all of its best ideas to Google. There’s still potential left in what remains of HTC, but if things don’t start improving soon, all of HTC’s greatest hits may remain strictly in the past.Android 8.0 • 6-inch 2880 x 1440 LCD display • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor • 6GB of RAM • 64GB or 128GB of storage • microSD card slot • stereo speakers • dual 8-MP front cameras • dual 12-MP rear cameras • IP-68 water resistance • USB 3.1 Type-C port • no headphone jack • 6.17 x 2.91 x 0.34-inches • 6.63 ounces"
73,Blackberry Key 2,https://gizmodo.com/the-blackberry-key2-makes-me-wish-physical-keyboards-we-1827156967,"Chances are that if you’re reading this, there’s one smartphone feature you care more about than anything else. That’s because even with the Key2’s sleeker, more refined design, an interesting choice of components, and its questionable BlackBerry heritage, this handset has one thing you simply don’t get on phones anymore: a good ‘ole physical keyboard. And I’ve got to admit that even though I’m much more accustomed to the touch-based keyboards found on every other device nowadays, the Blackberry Key2's keyboard is fantastic.And while that might sound kind of obvious, you got to remember, the Key2 basically has no competition in the physical keyboard space. That means TCL, which bought the rights to make BlackBerry phones back in 2016, could have slacked off, knowing that people who want tactile keys would have no choice but to turn to one of TCL’s reborn  devices. But they didn’t! Instead, the Key2 sports a keyboard with a slightly more grippy matte finish, and a new Speed key that gives you even more ways to customize the device.So now, on top of having a total of 52 shortcuts (short and long presses for each letter key) that can be assigned to specific apps, the Speed key lets you create custom functions like texting a specific person, toggling Bluetooth on or off, or even opening an Incognito tab in Chrome. All told, that’s a staggering level of customization, and that’s not even considering the convenience key on the side of the device, which can also be programmed to suit your needs.As for the keyboard itself, the keys are even clickier and sturdier than before, and they even have a built-in backlight so you can hammer out texts and emails in the dark. When navigating the phone, you can also use the keyboard as a giant touchpad, swiping left and right when you’re hunting for a specific app, or scrolling up and down when browsing the news. Even the Key2’s space bar pulls double duty by serving as the phone’s fingerprint reader, and it’s just as fast as any of the dedicated sensors found on computing devices. With everything TCL has crammed into this one feature, the Key2’s keyboard is much more than a set of old-fashioned buttons, it’s the heart of the device.Okay, enough about the keyboard, how’s the rest of the phone? Really, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The Key2’s 6GB of RAM, 64GB (or 128GB) of storage, and microSD card are good for business types who frequently need to switch between apps or store files on their device. However, the Key2’s Snapdragon 660 processor only offers about half the raw performance you’d get from a something with a Snapdragon 845 chip, although that’s kind of to be expected since the Key2 costs a more reasonable $650. On Web XPRT 2015, which measures browser performance, the Key2 hit just 181, while Snapdragon 845 devices like the Galaxy S9 and OnePlus 6 were up in the 280s. And in terms of overall speed, the Key2 scored 5,613 for multi-core performance in Geekbench 4, versus 8,414 and 9,109 for the S9 and OP6, respectively. So don’t expect this phone to age as well as more expensive premium devices.Then there’s the Key2’s LCD screen, which at just 4.5-inches across and featuring an unusual 1620 x 1080 resolution, seems like something you’d get on a phone five years ago. With a peak brightness of 458 nits, it doesn’t lack luminance, but overall screen real estate is the compromise you make for that physical keyboard. Now sometimes, when you’re composing an email or sending a text, that doesn’t matter since that space would just be used for a touch keyboard instead. But when  watching videos, you often end up with letterboxes on top and bottom that makes the display feel even smaller than it is.Thankfully, with a sizable 3,500 mAh battery, what the Key2 lacks in pure speed or a pretty screen, it makes up for in longevity. It had a time of 11 hours and 17 minutes on our rundown test, which is the same as what we got from the Pixel 2 XL, and only slightly behind the Huawei P20 Pro’s 11:36. And for those not ready to make the jump to the world of wireless audio, fear not, because the Key2 still has a headphone jack along with a standard USB-C port on bottom.And for the more mature among us worried about security, Blackberry’s DTEK app has you covered. Not only is there a new Secure Folder than can be a password or fingerprint protected place for stashing sensitive apps or files (no one can borrow your phone and just scroll through your Instagram), the DTEK app also monitors the type of permissions other apps request, including how often they ask. So if Facebook is trying to use your camera or microphone in the background, the DTEK app will catch it, so that you can revoke access and protect your privacy with a couple quick taps.Now here comes the bad news. While the Key2 is the first BlackBerry to feature dual rear cameras, the quality of pictures they capture can vary from fine to funky depending on lighting conditions. In bright light, the Key2 shoots passable pics that don’t really offend, but you can still see things like blown out highlights in a picture I took of a bunch radishes, or a general softness and less vibrant colors in a shot of a statue of Gandhi.But when the lights go down, that’s when the Key2 starts to struggle. Even with ample outdoor lighting, in a face-off against a OnePlus 6, the Key2’s photo lacks the rich colors captured by the OP6, has noticeably less dynamic range, and more grain. And that’s compared to a phone that costs $100 less than the Key2. In even darker conditions, the differences are quite shocking. The shot from the OnePlus 6 looks like an actual photo, while the Key2’s pic starts to stray into impressionist painting territory. It’s dark, there’s almost nothing approaching what I’d call sharp, and some objects even start to blend into each other. Suffice to say, if you’re someone who likes snapping pics in poorly lit places like restaurants or bars, the Key2’s low-light camera performance could be a deal breaker. But hey, at least those dual cams give you a portrait mode right?That camera performance means your typical hypebeast or Insta-addict better stay away. Yet in a world already overcrowded with phones sporting glass sandwich designs, it’s so nice to have something that feels different! The Key2’s aluminum chassis is both sleek and stylish (and noticeably slimmer than last year’s KeyOne), while the soft-touch textured plastic in back is a joy to touch. Combine that with more than solid battery life, good enough performance, and a reasonable price, and the Key2 feels like it’s a phone for more than just the physical keyboard die-hards out there. While the era of the tactile smartphone keyboard is clearly over, the Key2 makes a great case for why it’s too soon for that feature to completely disappear.

74,Motorola S,https://gizmodo.com/motorola-s-making-the-cheap-smartphone-even-harder-to-r-1826916725,"Apple and Samsung would have you believe quality smartphones should cost the many hundreds of dollars you must sacrifice to obtain their rarefied devices. But in recent years, the march of time has made that notion obsolete. In 2012, a $200 device was nearly unusable. But now? Sharp screens are cheap, and fast processors are even cheaper. Inexpensive smartphones have been pretty good for years! And so, the $250 Motorola G6 is the latest in the company’s line of devices serving as a harbinger of the inevitable: Pretty good might be good enough for everyone. Sure, it’s missing a few niceties, and looks like a generic slab of plastic, but those faults are easy to ignore for under $300. Did I mention it has a headphone jack?The Lenovo-owned Motorola has been working to make more affordable Android smartphones a compelling option, and has done pretty well so far. There are definitely cheaper phones on the market, even from Motorola itself. The company makes the budget E4 and E4 Plus, priced well below the G6’s $250 price tag. The Moto G line of smartphones represents the company’s mid-range tier, which means you can expect a slightly bigger and better device, but nothing like the company’s flagship Moto Z line, which features a much faster processor and supports the company’s Moto Mod phone add-ons. Still, $250 is $250, and you get what you pay for. So let’s run through the trade offs you’ll be faced with if you decide to go cheap.The G6, running a near-stock Android 8.0, has an all-glass body made of Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3. Unfortunately it feels more like plastic with a few coats of gloss on top. It’s slippery, and prone to collecting an unsightly amount of fingerprints. Its thin power button and volume rocker aren’t as tactile as they need to be, and make it difficult to tell when you’ve actually pressed them. Its home button is an oblong capacitive fingerprint sensor that supports left and right swiping to go back and access recent apps, respectively. It’s got a pair of rear cameras, one 12-megapixel and one 5-megapixel, though the latter is used in service of photo effects like a hit-or-miss portrait mode (that can’t properly blur around my bald head for some reason) and selective color effects. It’s an expensive gimmick to have, one I’d rather replace with a lens capable of optical zoom. But hey, everyone loves portrait mode, I guess. There’s also an 8-megapixel front-facing camera for your standard-fare selfie. The camera app supports an assortment of features like filters and Google Lens. But your photos won’t make any great impressions, and so-so low-light performance means your images will be grainier than you’d like. It’s also pretty sluggish to start, and the slight delay from tapping the shutter button is too long for my liking.  There’s no wireless charging support, nor is there NFC. Wireless charging might be a luxury, but removing connectivity options like NFC, used to pair with accessories, share data with people, and pay for things using your smartphone seems like a mistake.Also don’t expect any serious waterproofing. The G6 opts for a “water repellent nano-coating” to protect it from random splash damage. But it won’t help after a few minutes submerged.Yes, you can play PUBG (on the lowest graphical setting) and whatever other game captures your fancy, but don’t expect any stunning visuals. Also, expect a scorching hot phone after a few minutes of stalking opponents through the woods. Games designed to run at the more common 16:9 aspect ratio suffer from justification to the left of the display, leaving a small black bar where the extra real estate is.It sounds like I’m ripping on it, but those gripes are compared to much pricier phones! The G6 is actually pretty good at being a decent smartphone, especially for the price. A good screen, enough room for apps and photos, and USB-C support add up to a smartphone that seeks to excel at what people care about most, and focuses on the fundamentals before adding (or not adding) on extras. There’s 32GB of built-in storage to work with and some breathing room thanks to a microSD card slot. There’s a USB-C port, along with a headphone jack, two popular interfaces your thousand-dollar iOS device doesn’t have (and desperately needs). It’s got a 5.7-inch 2220 x 1080  display (that gives it an 18:9 aspect ratio), and Snapdragon 450 processor.Instead of adding a garish skin or suite of custom icons, the G6's customization comes in the form of its Moto Actions app. The gesturing feature lets you activate often used features—like turning on the flashlight, opening the camera app, or silencing your phone—by flicking your wrist or flipping your phone upside down. Since the company introduced the feature in its beloved Moto X, it’s been my favorite thing about the company’s devices. I’m not saying the G6 should be your next smartphone. If you’ve got the cash, get yourself something with more oomph in the processing department. But the Motorola G6 is the perfect smartphone for those existing in a liminal space, who would rather avoid using a cripplingly slow device until their ship comes in. Break your iPhone? Don’t pay for another one when a new device is around the corner. Get a G6. Did your mom drop her flip phone in the ocean during her vacation? Send her a G6 instead of flowers. Your butterfingers teenager need a smartphone? Until they’re done sweating from all that puberty, give them a G6. It’s good enough that they won’t sweat the stuff cut to make it cheap."
75,Xperia XZ2,https://gizmodo.com/the-xperia-xz2-is-the-best-phone-sony-has-made-in-years-1827049055,"The Sony that many people think of, the electronics giant that made the Walkman, the Discman, the Trinitron, all those Vaios, and even the first water-resistant phone back in 2013, it doesn’t really exist anymore. Sure, the Playstation 4 is doing great and Sony’s mirrorless cameras are some of the best on the market, but many of Sony’s other gadgets like Blu-ray players, TVs, and especially phones have been on the decline. And when Sony’s new CEO Kenichiro Yoshida talked to investors in late May, he said the future of Sony rests upon three main categories: services, semiconductors, and robotics/AI.That message implies Sony could soon be on its way out of consumer tech, which would be a real tragedy from a gadget standpoint, but also a loss because after years of lackluster phones and an overly aggressive release cycle, Sony Mobile is finally turning things around, and the new Xperia XZ2 is proof.Without completely abandoning the boxy, minimalist styling of previous Xperia phones, by shaving down its bezels and going with a new 5.7-inch 18:9 LCD display, the XZ2 looks relatively modern while avoiding features like a notch at the top. And around back, the phone feels even better, because the rear glass panel sports a subtle curve that stems from Sony’s new Ambient Flow design philosophy, which lets the XZ2 nestle in your hand as if it was always meant to be there.Sony has even switched up the placement of the phone’s fingerprint sensor, which now rests on the phone’s back instead of its side like on previous Xperias. Unfortunately, its new home almost smack dab in the middle is so low down, that even after a couple weeks of using it, I still found myself trying to unlock the phone by touching the rear 19-MP camera instead of the actual fingerprint reader.Below the screen, a small speaker slit works with the phone’s earpiece to deliver true stereo speakers with impressive quality and ample volume, even if max output is slightly less than what you get from a Galaxy S9 Plus. But what might be the best part of the phone is Sony’s new haptic vibration engine that feels less like the weak ass buzz you get from typical phones, and more like the rumble you feel on a Playstation 4 controller. Obviously, it works when your playing games to add an extra level of immersions, but it also works anytime you watch a video or listen to music, and can be adjusted from a little wiggle to a full-on attempt to shake the shit out of your hands.And on the inside, the XZ2 has all the important flagship phone areas covered. It’s got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 CPU, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a microSD card slot, a USB-C port for charging and data transfer and even support for Qi wireless charging. Sony also made sure to include a decent-sized 3,180 mAh battery, which let the XZ2 last 10 hours and 42 minutes on our rundown test, far better than the 9 hours I got wit the LG G7, though not quite as good as the Pixel 2 XL’s 11:17 or the S9 Plus’ 12:27. Really, the only feature the XZ2 is missing is a headphone jack, though with Samsung, LG, and OnePlus seemingly the only phonemakers refusing to fully embrace our Bluetooth audio future hell, it’s hard to fault Sony too much for not including a 3.5mm port. Sony even kept the XZ2’s dedicated two-step shutter button, which remains an absolute joy to use for anyone like me who often longs for the tactile controls found on real cameras. And then there’s the XZ2’s camera quality in general. Despite Sony being the company that manufactures the lion’s share of camera sensors found in today’s smartphones, recent Xperias often had a hard time keeping up with image quality from phones made by Samsung and others. But the XZ2 is different, because on top of sporting a 19-MP rear camera that’s higher resolution than the typical 12-MP cams used in competing phones, the XZ2 is the first phone that supports 4K HDR video capture, and like the Galaxy S9, the XZ2 also has a 960 fps slow-mo.More importantly, in a side-by-side photo comparison, the XZ2 was never far behind the Galaxy S9 Plus, and on a few occasions, produced pics with more accurate colors. Take for example a photo taken at a swanky outdoor working space where the XZ2 avoided the overly yellow color cast captured by the S9 Plus, or another shot in low-light at a local restaurant that made the food simply look more appetizing.However, during my testing, I noticed that the XZ2 also tends to amp up red tones, even past the already the saturated hues produced by Samsung’s cameras, a quirk that was most obvious when I snapped a pic of some strawberries at a farmers’ market. And in more challenging situations like a pic shot at sunset, the S9 Plus’ better metering and dynamic range did more justice to the swirl of colors in the sky. In fact, my biggest pet peeve with the XZ2 is the way it doesn’t fully show details in the camera’s viewfinder until you press down on the shutter. It’s kind of like the texture pop-in you sometimes see when playing video games on a console, as if the photo is so sharp, the phone can’t display everything in full detail until you just before you snap a pic.But those are really only minor quirks for a phone that at $800, cost $40 less than a Galaxy S9 Plus. And even though it’s not as sleek or pretty as Samsung’s device, and its LCD screen lacks the vivid colors of the S9's OLED display, there’s something attractive about the way the XZ2 feels like its found it’s niche. When I first talked to Don Mesa, VP of Sony Mobile’s US division, he said the XZ2 “feels like a reset,” and it shows. The XZ2 demonstrates that Sony has finally latched onto important trends of modern smartphone design, but without chasing things like notches that often make it hard to differentiate a lot of recently released phones. The XZ2 still has its own style, its own rumble-powered shimmy, and with Sony paying more attention to things like software updates (the XZ2 is even part of Google’s Android P Beta program) and photo processing, it’d be a damn shame for Sony to give up on phones now. And while I didn’t get a chance to fully review the XZ2’s smaller sibling, the XZ2 Compact, it’s important to mention that Sony is pretty much the only phone maker that still cares about making small phones with high-end components. If there was an award for the most improved smartphone maker of 2018, it would have to go to Sony and the Xperia XZ2.Android 8.1 • 5.7-inch 18:9 2160 x 1080 LCD display •  Snapdragon 845 • 4GB of RAM • 64GB of storage • microSD card slot • 3180 mAh battery • IP68 water-resistance • 19-MP rear cam • 5-MP front camera • Qi wireless charging • available in black, silver, green, and pink"
76,Oneplus 6,https://gizmodo.com/oneplus-6-review-the-best-android-phone-that-wont-dest-1826158898,"The OnePlus 6 might be the most boring phone the company has ever made. Don’t get me wrong, that’s not meant as an insult, but more as a reflection on how far the company has come since the original OnePlus One. Because even though OnePlus’ latest device might not carry with it the same excitement as some of the company’s previous phones, as a total package, the OP6 is arguably even more important in today’s world of $1,000 handsets. Oh and it’s also OnePlus’ best phone yet.  Back in 2014, the company’s first phone was targeted at spec-obsessed phone nerds who wanted a more affordable device that still had top-of-the-line components, but without the superfluous features or software bloat that you got on the Samsung, LG, and HTC devices of the era. Despite a few technical issues such as  yellow-tinted screens and people’s annoyance with the invite system, the OnePlus One was a wild success. It was a hard-edged phone whose backside was literally covered in sandpaper, while also delivering high-end components and the freedom for phone nerds to tinker around with the handset’s inner workings. However, as the company  matured, so too have its devices. That once signature sandstone back eventually gave way to metal on the OnePlus 3, before getting replaced by glass on the new OnePlus 6, which mirrors a lot of other phones out right now. Then, at the top of the OP6’s big 6.3-inch display, there’s a notch, another feature that’s very on trend. At this point, notches aren’t cutting edge anymore, they are just a relatively simple tactic for delivering what everyone seems to want: more screen.Now, not everyone is onboard with these moves, especially among some of the more die-hard fanatics who aren’t really big fans of change. But that’s to be expected as OnePlus seeks a bigger piece of the mainstream pie. OnePlus has hired supermodels to explain its fast charging battery tech, partnered with Disney and fashion brands like Collette for special limited edition phones, and hosted pop up stores around the globe just to get its phones in the hands of a bigger audience.But all those stunts are just distractions, because  the OnePlus 6 is a damn good phone. It’s FHD+ OLED screen is impressively vibrant, with brightness hitting 638 nits. That’s better than the Galaxy S9+ (605 nits) and the Huawei P20 Pro (565 nits). It’s performance is as good as any other flagship Android phone, with the OP6 sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip, 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage standard.  And all of this comes from a phone that starts at just $530. That’s  $200 less than a Galaxy S9, $270 less than a Pixel 2 XL, and $420 less than a Galaxy Note 8. So yes, even though the OnePlus 6 is significantly more expensive than the OG OnePlus One, which cost $300 when it debuted, it still represents a considerable bargain compared to today’s premium phones. Also, thanks in large part to the improved energy efficiency of that Snapdragon 845 chip, the OnePlus 6’s battery life improved to 13 hours and 3 minutes, despite having the same 3,300 mAh battery as the OnePlus 5T (it got only 11 hours and 22 minutes). So even though the spring phone release season is still ongoing, that 13 hour battery mark is the longest we’ve seen, both this year and all-time.On the inside, OnePlus’ Oxygen OS is the closest thing to stock Android you can get without having a Pixel or a new Nokia phone. Oxygen OS feels fast, its transitions are silky without a hint of jitter, and it even improves on some things Google has in store for the next version of Android. Not only does Oxygen have a built-in dark mode, which supports delicious black backgrounds that take full advantage of the OP6’s AMOLED screen, its optional gesture controls are even slicker. Unlike the half-hearted “pill” in Android P that still takes up room at the bottom of the screen, OnePlus’ gestures completely eliminate any sort of on screen nav buttons. Navigation is as simple as swiping up from the bottom center edge to go home, swiping up and holding to view recent apps, and swiping up on the left or right sides to go back. It’s simple, it’s elegant, and after using it even for a short time, it’s hard going back to an old-school nav bar.At the same time, those savings mean the OnePlus 6 doesn’t have every bell and whistle. Like the OP5T, the OP6 sports face unlock that’s quite speedy, but not as secure as Samsung’s iris recognition in the Galaxy S9 or the facial scanning tech in Apple’s FaceID. The OnePlus 6 also doesn’t have stereo speakers or wireless charging, the latter of which I find especially annoying because there’s no metal on the back of the OP6 to screw with inductive charging.OnePlus also says the OP6 should be able to withstand a quick splash of water, except the phone doesn’t have an official IP rating, so if the phone does comes in contact with water, there are no guarantees it’ll survive. This is one thing I think OnePlus really need to address. OnePlus isn’t really a startup anymore. With revenue of $1.4 billion in 2017, it’s past time the company got its stuff certified so it can truly stand behind its products. And as you often find with a lot of foreign phones, the OnePlus doesn’t  support CDMA networks, which means this phone isn’t really an option for people on Verizon or Sprint.As for the OP6’s cameras, OnePlus has reduced the secondary 20-MP cam’s role to only helping out with depth of field effects like in the phone’s portrait mode. It’s a bit sad, because on the OP5, the second cam gave you a little extra zoom, while on the OP5T, it was dedicated to shooting more challenging low-light pics. But what the OP6 lacks in versatility, it makes up for in overall image quality. In fact after a number of side-by-side comparison testing various conditions including bright light, low light and the phone’s portrait mode, I was thoroughly impressed by the OP6’s ability to keep up with the Galaxy S9+. Even though sometimes the 6’s pics weren’t always as sharp or as brightly lit, the differences were often so minimal, it’s really hard to complain.But in the end, that’s kind of OnePlus’ entire purpose. The OnePlus 6 isn’t as feature rich as the Pixel 2 XL, the Galaxy S9+, or even the LG G7,  which are its closest competitors in terms of specs. But starting at $530, it also costs just two-thirds the price, and the things that it can do, it does really well. The performance, battery life and camera aren’t just good, they’re great, and there really isn’t another phone priced between $400 and $700 that I’d rather buy. So while that grouping might sound like an arbitrary division, that’s precisely the range people are looking at after balking at the increased prices of so many recent flagship phones. The OnePlus 6 may not be the wildest or most ambitious phone OnePlus has ever made, but it does strike a fantastic balance between what you need, and what you have to shell out to get it.

77,LG G7,https://gizmodo.com/lgs-g7-thinq-is-too-clever-for-its-own-good-1825818482,"In Fight Club, there’s a scene when after meeting Tyler Durden for the first time, the narrator cracks a joke about how the people you meet on airplanes are single-serving friends. And then, before even giving his seatmate a chance to respond, he launches into an explanation of his witty turn-of-phrase. But before he can finish, Durden dryly retorts  “Oh no, I get it. It’s very clever. How’s that working out for you?”That sentiment pretty accurately describes how I feel about the LG G7 ThinQ. On its latest flagship phone, the company devoted so much time to honing and equipping the G7 with neat little features, it seems like LG lost sight of the bigger picture. Notched displays and cameras with AI-powered object recognition can be fun party tricks, but ultimately, they aren’t groundbreaking ideas. It’s unfortunate  because after spending some time with the G7, the phone has grown on me. But at the same time, the G7 still has a number of flaws, and until LG reckons with the ongoing identity crisis that sank its last two G-series handsets, its phones won’t have the kind of impact they could, and should have.Let’s start with that silly ThinQ branding. Ostensibly, the idea is to unite all of LG’s premium products from dishwashers to air conditions to phones under a single AI-assisted platform. But as far as I can tell, the only assistant on the G7 is the one made by Google, so I’m not sure what all those smarts are actually doing. Instead, LG decided to enhance the Google Assistant with a dedicated button on the phone’s left edge, which sadly can’t be reprogrammed for other uses, though it can be disabled. LG also added handful a unique Google Assistant commands for the G7, which are mostly used for saying things like “Hey Google, open the camera with AI Cam.”But before you actually go ahead and do that, you might want to reconsider, because  when I tested the dual 16-MP rear cams on our pre-production G7 review unit, actually letting LG’s AI cam take control wasn’t always the best idea. Sometimes, like when I took a shot during the day of San Francisco’s North Beach, the AI cam did a fine job of detecting the scenery and adjusting the settings to create a more pleasing shot. Compared to standard auto, the AI cam’s pic features better white balance, more saturated colors, and a nice blue sky without going overboard.However, when a snapped a pic at night of a church on Nob Hill in San Francisco, the AI cam missed badly, producing a blurry mess of a shot, with a heavy orange tint, and a general lack of detail. And this wasn’t just a one-time anomaly either, because in subsequent low-light shots, the G7’s AI cam continued to produce lackluster results.The G7’s AI cam isn’t the phone’s only photo trick. The phone also uses pixel binning, which takes groups of four pixels on the camera’s sensor and combines them into one giant pixel, giving the G7 increased low-light sensitivity. It might sound kind of complicated, but it’s something a number of companies have tried on phones since as far back as the HTC One M7 from 2013. Sadly, all that trickery doesn’t actually result in better photos. In comparing low-light shots between the G7 and Galaxy S9+, Samsung’s superior optics gave it the edge.In the low-light pic above of some extra fatty  tuna, the S9+’s increased resolution, and much better details beat out what I got from the G7. In the LG’s pic, the mound of wasabi and the garnish have almost no discernible texture, and very little of the pic is anything approaching sharp. The G7’s only real advantage is slightly better white balance, which is something easily fixed with a bit of editing. As for the G7’s other assorted tricks, its 6.1-inch LCD display impresses by actually delivered on its 1000-nit brightness claim. And that mark isn’t just relegated to when you have a small section of white on an otherwise dark image, as I measured it on a completely white screen. In fact, with brightness that topped out at 1017 nits, the G7’s screen was over 400-nits brighter than the 605 nits I saw on the Galaxy S9+. Unfortunately, the only way I could get the G7 to pump out that much light was by shining a high-powered flashlight directly at its front-facing ambient light sensor. In more typical conditions outdoors in direct sunlight, I found that the G7’s often hesitated to actually get that bright, and was screen frequently harder to view than a Galaxy S9. Then there’s the G7’s screen notch, which LG calls a second screen as if it were some weird homage to the LG V10 and LG V20.  LG, just be honest and call it what it is. I like there are a number of options for hiding or masking the cutout, in case you’re someone that’s still not down with the trend. But the strangest decision LG made on the entire device was to reduce the phone’s battery capacity from the 3,500 mAh power pack you got on the LG G6, to just 3,000 mAh on the LG G7. That means instead of battery life going up by almost two hours like we’ve seen on some other recent phones, the G7’s longevity only increased by about 45 minutes compared to the previous generation, a difference due almost entirely to the G7’s more energy efficient Snapdragon 845 processor. So in the end, the G7’s total runtime only hit 8 hours and 54 minutes, which would have been pretty good two years ago, but with phones like the Pixel 2 XL (11:17), Huawei P20 Pro (11:36), and Galaxy S9+ (12:27) all hitting 11 hours or more, a sub 9-hour score just doesn’t cut it.What’s even worse is that in exchange for that smaller battery, LG used the extra room to create a cavity inside the phones for bigger speakers and better bass. And you know what? LG totally succeeded, because the G7 is loud as hell for a phone. When you turn the volume up all the way, you can even feel the whole back of the phone vibrate thanks to a cavity that helps amplify low-notes like you get in a real speaker cabinet. But once again, there’s a downside, because the G7 doesn’t have stereo speakers like pretty much every other flagship phone nowadays, so overall audio quality is simply good, not great. The one saving grace for the G7 is that with its built-in 32-bit hi-fi DAC and new DTS:X headphone tech which provides virtual surround sound effects, plugging wired headphones into the G7 sounds even better. Attention audiophiles, this is your phone.The G7 is a puzzling phone. LG spent a lot of time trying to get tricky, while somehow overlooking important shortcomings in other areas. The G7 has a nice build, and that Moroccan Blue glass back is simply stunning in the right light. But its AI cam is wonky, its battery is undersized, and its second screen is really just a notch. Though ultimately, none of this may actually matter, because all those pros and cons really depends on pricing. Currently, neither LG nor carriers have announced what the G7 will cost. If it’s anywhere near $720 (the current price of a Galaxy S9), the G7 is sunk. But if it’s more like $650 (or less ideally), then maybe the G7 can survive with all its flaws, as a quirky clever phone that has something even better trapped inside.Android 8 Oreo • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 • 4GB of RAM • 64GB of storage • 6.1-inch QHD+ LCD display • microSD card slot • dual 16-MP rear cameras • 8-MP front camera • IP68 water resistance • built-in 32-bit DAC • DTS-X headphone • USB 3.1 Type-C port • 3,000 mAh battery • 6.03 x 2.83 x 0.31-inches • 5.71 ounces • available in four colors (gray, blue, raspberry • black)"
78,Huaweis P20 pro,https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-triple-camera-p20-pro-is-too-cool-for-america-1825647834,"Despite having sold its phones here for years, 2018 was supposed to be Huawei’s big coming out party in the U.S. At CES, I sat through a presentation about how Huawei was expanding into home wifi and had even signed Wonder Woman herself as the company’s new brand ambassador.But then AT&T, Verizon, and Best Buy all backed out of or canceled deals to carry the company’s phones in retail stores; all while Huawei faced even greater pressure from U.S. intelligence. That left Huawei’s latest flagship phone—the P20 Pro—in a weird place, because instead of potentially being the first P-series phone to get sold in America,  we’re left watching it thrive overseas with no hopes of a stateside release. And that’s a damn shame, because with a gorgeous design and an innovative triple camera setup, the P20 Pro is actually a pretty great device.Even just looking at the specs, you can see where Huawei made a lot of smart decisions. Featuring a Kirin 970 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage as standard. (There’s no microSD expandability, but who really cares these days.) Meanwhile the dual SIM tray is a boon for frequent travelers. But P20 Pro’s real treat is its giant 4,000 mAh battery. On our battery rundown test, the P20 Pro lasted 11 hours and 36 minutes. That’s better than even the Pixel 2 XL (11:17), though  still slightly short of the S9+’s time of 12:27, which remains the best time we’ve recorded yet this year. Then there are other little things like the IR blaster embedded in the top edge of the device, which is feature that used to be quite common, but almost every phone maker has long abandoned. And as you’d expect from a phone of this caliber and price, you get IP67 water-resistance and some pleasantly powerful stereo speakers. That said, the P20 Pro still has two big sticking points: the lack of a headphone jack and wireless charging. Being forced to use USB audio is something you can mull over yourself, you can either deal with it or you can’t. But no wireless charging is a strange omission considering the phone’s 900 euro price tag, which translates to around $1,100. Unlike last year’s P10, whose metal back made it difficult for the phone to play nice with wireless charging tech, the P20’s back is a big sheet of glass. For a phone this expensive, there’s really no excuse. Perhaps Huawei’s plan was to dazzle users with one of sparkling colors. With an entrancing color shift from green to purple, Huawei’s signature Twilight paint job looks like nothing else out there. But even in the standard blue of our review unit, the P20 Pro is just as sharp. Now I know some people might take issue with Huawei’s use of a notch, but there really isn’t anything to complain about. Out of the box, the cut out for the P20 Pro 20-MP front-facing camera is pretty obvious. But if you’re not a fan, there’s an option in the display settings to mask the notch with black bars on either side. This gives you the ability to see your notifications and time, date, and battery like you would normally, but without having something protruding into the screen, and in my opinion, it’s the best blend of form and function.But enough with all the dilly dallying, how bout those cameras? Sporting a 20-MP black-and-white camera, a massive 40-MP RGB camera, and a 8-MP camera with a 3X zoom, Huawei’s world-first camera arrangement has something for everyone. Using the monochrome cam, even on something as simple as a black and white photo, the P20 Pro easily out shot the Galaxy S9 in gray scale mode. Frankly, it’s not even  close, as the P20 Pro’s captured much better details and sharper edges versus the complete oversaturation seen in the S9’s pic. And these abilities aren’t relegated just to black-and-white shots either.When using the 40-MP RGB camera, which is what the phone relies on most of the time, the P20 Pro uses the monochrome camera to help capture fine details, while the 40-MP camera concentrates on colors and everything else. On top of that, the P20 Pro’s 40-MP sensor uses a quad bayer filter which creates groups of four pixels and essentially combines them into one giant pixel, which lets the camera soak up a ton of light. So in the end, the phone spits out pictures that are just 10-MP in resolution, which are just slightly smaller than the 12-MP rear cameras in Pixel 2 XL and Galaxy S9, but not by much. And what you get in exchange for the loss in overall resolution is totally worth it.Just take a look at how the S9 and P20 Pro snapped a pic of some plums. The S9’s shot isn’t bad, but the P20 Pro’s pic has it beat it almost every single way: sharpness, color, detail, you name it. The most obvious example is when you zoom in to look at the labels on the fruit. The barcode and lettering in the S9’s photo looks a little fuzzy, while in the P20 Pro’s pic, lines are bold and crisp. Now I must point out that the P20 Pro’s pic is probably a little oversharpened, but it still beats the S9’s version hands down.And in low-light things get even better, because that quad bayer arrangement lets the P20 Pro hang with the S9, despite having a smaller f/1.7 aperture compared to the S9’s industry-leading f/1.5 iris. But then, Huawei went the extra step and created an incredible low-light mode that captures four-second  long-exposure shots that can be taken even while hand held. That’s right, no tripod needed. Now normally, this would cause streaks all over the place (and if people move around too fast, you still get a little motion blur), but on the P20 Pro, you get a sort of specialized nighttime HDR shots that often look shockingly good. Finally, there’s that 8-MP camera with a 3x optical zoom, which is 1x more than what you get on the iPhone X or Galaxy S9. So when you need that little extra reach, like say when you’re at a ballgame or concert, the P20 Pro has got you covered there too.However, the P20 Pro’s cameras aren’t without their flaws. Like the Mate 10 Pro. the P20 Pro has the ability to use object recognition to identify things like dogs, plants, and food, or scenes like landscape and blue sky, and then use that info to fine tune the camera settings for optimal results. The problem is that it seems in the six moths since Huawei’s last iteration, the company may have pushed its algorithms a little too far. For example, when I snapped very typical shot of some flowers, the P20 Pro pumped up saturation of greens and yellows to an absurd degree, to the point where the pic almost looks neon. You can also kind of see in the clock photo above, where the blue-sky mode does a little bit too good of a job making those blues stand out. Thankfully, disabling the auto-tuning is as simple as hitting the little “x” next to the object recognition tag in the camera app.But here’s the real tragedy, Huawei isn’t selling the P20 Pro in the states, and based on pressure from seemingly everly level of the government, there’s almost no chance that will change. In fact, just four months in, it seems Huawei may have already decided to reconsider is expansion into the US, in favor of refocusing its efforts on more welcoming markets like Europe and Asia. That means like all those fancy cheeses made in France and elsewhere, or genuine Kobe beef from Japan, the Huawei P20 Pro is a delicacy only available overseas. That’s pretty depressing, because this is an exciting, innovative phone that gives Apple, Samsung, and Google’s best some actual competition. And the worst part about all this, is that we really only have ourselves to blame.EMUI 8.1 running on Android Oreo 8.1 • Kirin 970 processor  • 6GB of RAM • 128GB of storage • 6.1-inch 18:9 2240 x 1080 OLED display • 4,000 mAh battery • 24-MP front cam • rear 20-MP monochrome cam • rear 40-MP RGB cam • 8-MP telephoto cam with 3x optical zoom •USB 3.1 Type-C port • NFC •  6.10 x 2.91 x 0.31 inches • 6.35 ounces"
79,Samsung  galaxy S9,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review-the-best-android-phone-dont-n-1823575944,"Let’s not beat around the bush, the exterior of the Samsung Galaxy S9 is essentially a carbon copy of the S8. Yet, even with all that sameness, Samsung’s balanced no-notch design seems more considered than before. It doesn’t feel needy like a lot of the new iPhone X copycat handsets I saw at MWC. And what makes the S9 even better is that Samsung’s flagship comes with  the best guts you can get in an Android phone right now. I can’t help it, I’m a little bit in love.So let’s start with the easy stuff. The S9's screen is simply the best in the business. Not only has peak brightness improved to 605 nits (that’s more than 10 percent brighter than the 540 nits I got from the Note 8's display), colors are vibrant, images are sharp, and when it comes to other phones, I just don’t really want to look at them anymore. The only thing that really comes close is the display on the iPhone X, which as it happens, is also made by Samsung. Then there’s the S9's new stereo speakers, which are the first ones Samsung has put on any Galaxy phone. Like other handsets, it splits audio between the bottom-firing speaker and the earpiece. The latter functions a bit like a tweeter, offering up richer highs while helping balance out the mids, so that the bottom speakers can focus more on pushing out a not insignificant amount of bass. This means these speakers, while still not comparable to headphones or standalone speakers, actually sound pretty good.On the inside, as the first phone sporting Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 845 processor, the S9 is setting a new standard for what great performance Android should be. Everything just feels snappier, from launching apps to flipping through different pages on the home screen, to the point where I was wondering if Samsung did some sneaky stuff like speed up the S9's UI animations. But after seeing the benchmark numbers posted by the S9+, it’s clear there wasn’t really a need.Across both compute and graphics tests, the S9 performed 25 percent better than last year’s top marks. On Geekbench 4, the S9+ hit 8,414, versus the Huawei Mate 10 Pro’s score of 6,766 or the OnePlus 5T’s score of 6,752. Meanwhile, on 3DMark’s Slingshot Unlimited graphics test, the S9 scored 6,497, compared to 5,143 for the OP5T. And if you’re like me who often finds themselves living and working off your phone, the speed at which the S9 switches between even the most cumbersome of apps is downright delightful. The S9+’s new chip has also had a serious impact on battery life too. Despite having a 3,500 mAh battery which is the same size as the power pack in last year’s S8+, the S9+ lasted more than an hour and a half longer en route to an impressive time of 12 hours and 27 minutes on our rundown test. Going strictly by the numbers, that’s better than every phone I reviewed last year, aside from the Asus Zenfone 4 Max’s time of 16:13. But that phone’s only talent is its ridiculous longevity.The S9 actually has lots of other nice traits besides long battery life. Like Intelligent Scan. It’s Samsung’s response to Apple’s FaceID on the iPhone X. It’s also clever, if not really all that new. Basically, Samsung took the face unlock and iris recognition tech from last year’s S8, which could be used independently but not at the same time, and made it so that both functions worked together on the new S9. Now, if for whatever reason face unlock doesn’t work, the S9 then automatically gives your irises a go, before letting you into your phone. Over the better part of a week and half, I never had any real troubles with it, though it still isn’t quite as smooth as the iPhone X’s implementation and its sophisticated IR projector. It’s more likely to be spoofed with a mask or really high quality photo and the fact that Samsung itself won’t let you use Intelligent Scan with Samsung Pay or it’s Secure Folder says something about much it trusts the feature. To me, it’s a bonus, but not anything to brag about. Now onto that S9's new rear camera. For 2018, Samsung is trying to beat the rest by putting the first-ever adjustable aperture camera on a smartphone. Technically, it’s really a neat feat, letting the camera switch between a super wide f/1.5 for when you really need every last bit of light, and f/2.4 which lets you stop down and better control how many photons are hitting the camera’s sensor in bright daytime shots. However, unless you’re someone who is constantly fiddling with manual camera settings in pro-mode, the differences between the two apertures are hard to discern.In the right conditions and when the subject isn’t too far away, sometimes you can notice a difference in depth of field, which is the distance between the nearest and farthest things that appears to be in focus. But in auto mode, the S9 will just choose the whatever setting works best, and it’s almost always right. So most people won’t notice when the camera’s aperture changes.That said, don’t assume the S9's camera has failed to improve. It’s better. In well-lit scenes, the S9 can totally hang with the Pixel 2, even with Google’s often praised extra-special HDR processing. When I took a sample shot of lower Manhattan using both phones (see above), the biggest difference between the two  pictures was how the movement changed between the two sets of pics. The photos were essentially the same. So then I went back at night and took the exact same shot. That’s when the S9+ pulled ahead. With both handsets on auto (including HDR), Samsung’s version was clearly the winner. Say what you want about the powers of computational photography, that tech has it’s limits, and there’s still no substitute for high quality optics. With a f/1.8 aperture, the Pixel 2 XL just wasn’t able to pull in as much light, which resulted in a noticeably grainier and softer shot than what the S9+ produced. In fact, I was so shocked that after getting home and checking out both pics on my desktop monitor, I set up another head-to-head photo test to make sure everything was set up correctly.And in this intentionally poorly-lit face-off, the S9+ impressed even more. Between the Pixel 2 XL and the S9+, their shots look wildly different. Samsung’s new camera is a goddamn low-light champ.Later, I went back to shooting more traditional pics, and I do have to say that the Pixel 2 does have a slight edge in color saturation over the S9, but the difference isn’t anywhere close to the phones’ low-light discrepancies. The takeaway? Starting now, if I have to choose one phone to shoot something, the S9 is my pick. Additionally, the larger version of Samsung’s new flagship (the S9+) also sports a secondary 12-megapixel camera with a 2x zoom that we first saw on the Galaxy Note 8. It’s not a must have feature, but being able to push in just a bit closer makes me feel a little more OK when I decide to leave my real camera at home. The S9 can shoot slow-mo at up to 960 fps now too. For a short time, this feature had me trying to turn every little thing into a time-slowed video, and when it works, it’s pretty fun. You just have to know the limits, because 960 fps is basically the same as shooting with a shutter speed of 1/960th of a second, which means only well-lit stuff ends up looking good.Even Bixby, Samsung’s digital Assistant, which yes, still has its own button on the left, has gotten in one some of that sweet, sweet camera action. Now you can use it to try on makeup, or guesstimate how many calories are in a piece of food. And to my surprise, both of these features are good enough to give you a decent idea of what you’re working with. I just wouldn’t call them scientific. Yet for me, the best of these enhancements is Bixby’s translation feature, which lets you point the camera at foreign words before the S9 overlays understandable text on top without much of a wait. It’s not perfect, but it did help me make a more informed lunch purchase while stuck in the Barcelona airport.Only the S9 isn’t all speed and incredible battery life and camera performance. We need to talk about the one area where Samsung is obviously chasing the pack: AR Emojis. By using the S9's front camera, you can create little avatars based on your face that you can dress up, change their hair, or create shareable gifs that capture your reactions. But it’s just a gimmick. They kind of look like Nintendo Miis in a cartoony sort of way, and the clothing choices are super limited and dorky looking.For anyone wondering if AR Emoji’s better than Animoji’s? I don’t know, and I don’t really care, they are just different. Trying to decide between phones based solely on their ability to perform AR trickery is absurd.AR Emojis aside, this phone sounds great! But is the S9 worth upgrading to? If you’ve been using the same phone for two years or more, definitely. However for people who own an S8, the decision isn’t quite as clear. For the past year, I’ve spent most of my smartphone time spent switching between a regular S8 and a Pixel 2 XL. And as much as I like the S9's improvements, spending $720 or more after just 12 months is hard to justify (though I maintain the same could be said of almost anyone thinking about a one-year upgrade). You’ve got to really want it.And if you really want it the S9  has the most tricks in its bag. You get almost all of the nifty features Google includes in Android, along with optional dual cams, a smarter, more helpful iteration of Bixby, and a new generation of silicon that makes the phone feel snappy as fuck. There’s a lot of things I like about the Pixel 2 XL, but after spending prolonged time with the Galaxy S9+, I’m really struggling to find any major reasons to go back to it. I don’t particularly care that Intelligent Scan isn’t as secure as FaceID, and I admit that AR Emojis kind of suck too. However, the S9+’s superb battery life, class-leading low-light photography and  the best display ever made easily cancel that stuff out. It’s clear, Samsung is back out in front.Note: This review was tested using only the S9+, I will report back after I have a chance to check out the standard S9 as well.Runs Android 8 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor • 6GB of RAM (4GB on the regular S9) • 64GB of RAM  • 6.2-inch 2960 x 1440 AMOLED display • 8-MP front cam • 12-MP f/1.5-f/2.4 main rear cam, secondary 12-MP cam with 2x zoom • max slow-mo at 960 fps at 720p • stereo speakers • microSD card slot • headphone jack • IP68 certified • 6.22 x 2.91 x 0.33-inches • 6.67 ounces • available in black, lilac purple and coral blue (titanium gray is no available in the US at the moment)"
80,Essential Phone,https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-finally-makes-sense-1823185128,"The Essential Phone was supposed to be the one. Envisioned by Andy Rubin, the father of Android itself, and expertly crafted from a luxurious combo of ceramic, titanium, and Gorilla Glass, the PH-1 had the kind of pedigree you rarely see from a startup, let alone one that was trying to put out its first phone. But when you look back, aided by the gift of hindsight, it’s clear there was no way Essential could have ever delivered on the hype, especially after a launch plagued by repeated delays, difficulty delivering orders, and unfinished software. And with a price of $700 at launch, when I said the PH-1 was too expensive to have a camera that bad, that wasn’t an opinion, it was fact.But now, six months later, things have changed. After multiple price drops have brought it down to $500 and ample time to update its software, the PH-1 is, essentially, a different phone now. In the time following its launch, our PH-1 review unit spent much of its time sitting in a drawer. In the fall, Essential was quickly forgotten due to phones like the iPhone X, Google’s second Pixel, and the return of the original big-ass phablet after a two year hiatus. The PH-1 wasn’t really in the same class as those other flagships, to the point that using it as a comparison device didn’t make much sense. But when I pulled it out about a week ago, I couldn’t help but think that the Essential still looks like a dime.Even when viewed side by side with the iPhone X, the PH-1 makes Apple’s ridiculously priced phone look clunky. There’s no awkward camera hump protruding from its back or even a logo to take away from its clean, elegant lines. And in front, the cutout for the PH-1 8-MP selfie cam is both more stylish and less distracting than the iPhone X’s bloated notch—all while delivering a higher screen-to-body ratio than Apple’s handset too. There’s no doubt Essential nailed the design, and I appreciate it more now than I did before.Inside, the PH-1's UI is also spotless, running an unadulterated version of stock Android, which unfortunately remains on Android 7.1 instead of Android 8 Oreo. But the real test is in the phone’s camera app. At launch, on top of delivering soft images with a noticeable lack of detail, the phone often struggled to focus or even snap pics back-to-back in a timely manner. However, over the course of several repeated camera updates, Essential has made some marked improvements. Shutter response is faster, though you’ll still run into a bit of lag every now and then, and focusing speeds are quicker too.But the most important change is an overall improvement to image quality. After digging up a shot I took with the PH-1 at launch, I went and grabbed the exact same shot now that the phone has had six months of tinkering done to its camera. Even just a passing glance shows how much better the phone has gotten, but when you zoom into 100 percent, it’s obvious. Everything looks sharper and more detailed. Now you can see the texture on the concrete wall, and even colors look more vibrant. And the PH-1 doesn’t look good just when compared to itself either.In bright light, the PH-1 held its own against a photo captured by a OnePlus 5T. Sure, there are small differences in exposure and white balance, but if you look close, you might even say the OP5T’s pic looks a little soft compared the PH-1. Finally, Essential is putting out pics the can stand up to equally priced competition. However, I do have to point out, this only holds true in well-lit conditions. In low-light, the PH-1 still labors. When I snapped a pic of a nearby plush in my living room with the lights turned down, I was shocked to see how different each phone’s low light pic looked.And all of this brings us back to pricing. While the phone still has it flaws, at $500, a lot of its quirks, such as its lack of a microSD card slot, wireless charging or any sort of water-resistance, are much more forgivable. So has Essential totally redeemed itself? Definitely, or at least as much as it could in the face of the hyperbolic promises it originally had about revolutionizing the industry.It’s not perfect, but it now it finally feels like Essential has something to build on. With a gorgeous body that is somehow more impressive than before, a tidy UI, improved software, and a price that makes sense, the PH-1 has carved out its niche. And even though we can’t quite figure out what’s going on with its new color options, those look good too."
81,Honor S,https://gizmodo.com/honor-s-mid-range-phone-is-trying-to-save-us-from-the-1822838663,"For the last few years, $600, $650, or maybe even $700 was all you needed to get a brand new top-of-the—line phone. But in 2018, a lot of people are going to tasked with a difficult choice: shell out another $200 or $300 to hit the increased price tags flagships are now demanding, or settle for something a bit more affordable. And at first, this proposition might sound like another frustrating aspect of an increasingly crazy product cycle, but it doesn’t actually have to be that way. That’s because there are mid-range phones like the $500 OnePlus 5T and this new Honor View 10, that can make that second option feel less like a compromise and more like a good way to stop getting screwed.A quick glance down the spec list reveals that all the most important stuff is there: from the View 10’s extra-tall 5.99-inch 18:9 LCD display, to the built-in front-mounted fingerprint reader, sturdy aluminum build, and  the handy headphone jack down below. Even the amount of memory and storage you get are quite impressive, as the View 10 comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage standard, with the latter being double what you’d get on a standard OnePlus 5T or the pricey $900 Galaxy Note 8. And in case you still need more room for apps and photos, the second slot in the dual SIM tray supports microSD cards too.In fact, the View 10’s biggest flaws are minor omissions, like its lack of wireless charging and water-resistance, and the unfortunate limitation of not having CMDA network compatibility, which means this phone isn’t an option for people on Verizon or Sprint. The other really frustrating thing is that despite being announced at the end of 2017, we’re still waiting on official US pricing and availability. It almost certainly has nothing to do with the espionage concerns leveled at Honor’s parent company Huawei. Huawei has run into major difficulties when trying to partner with US carriers to sell its latest flagship, but  Honor has always relied on direct-to-consumer sales.My only other quibble with the View 10 is the way Huawei’s EMUI 8 skin looks. It’s one of the most radical departures from stock Android available today, with its rounded notifications cards, lack of an app drawer and iOS-style Share menus. Thankfully, all these things can be customized in the phone’s settings, including the overall look and feel of the UI via the Theme app. I just wish I didn’t have to spend so much time fiddling with everything out of the box. Then there are other things like Honor’s claim of enhanced AI that are meant to improve how the phone functions. It’s a feature borrowed straight from Huawei’s latest flagship, the Mate 10 Pro. However, in real life, the effects of the phone’s extra smarts are often quite hard to discern. Honor claims that machine learning algorithms will automatically tune your phone for better battery life and make sure performance still feels snappy a year or more down the road, but it never does so in a way where you notice it happening, which often leaves you wondering if it’s actually happening.The two exceptions to this is a custom version of Microsoft’s Translator app, which uses the Honor 10’s Kirin 970’s neural processing unit to deliver on-the-fly exchanges using either, written, spoken or even text captured in a picture. In my short time I spent testing it by spitting admittedly poorly pronounced Chinese at the Honor 10, it almost always came back with the correct response. However, once again, when compared side-by-side with other big translating apps from Google and others, it was hard to tell how much heavy lifting the View 10’s AI was really doing. On the other hand, the View 10’s AI-enhanced camera makes it easy to tell when the phone’s silicon smarts are helping. Using image recognition, the phone can identify a handful of different subjects like cats, dogs, plants, food and more. And when it does, it’ll pop up a little corresponding icon in the bottom of the phone’s camera UI, while using that knowledge to automatically adjust camera settings to get the best pic possible. When it works, it really does feel a bit like magic. In a side-by-side shot between the View 10 and the OnePlus 5T, after correctly determining I was taking a photo of a plant, or what’s better know as my lazy attempt to use tech to grow basil indoors, the View 10 produced a shot with better white balance and  more detail in the shadows for a more pleasing image overall. It’s not a night and day improvement, but it is noticeable.But when not assisted by AI smarts, I found colors from the View 10 were often more muted than those from the OP5T. And in low-light, things weren’t even close, as evidence by a dimly shot of everyone’s favorite cuddly sci-fi birds in the slideshow below. Though, to be honest, that’s not entirely unexpected as the OnePlus’ secondary camera was designed specifically to improve low-light photography. The View 10 tries to counters with a second rear cam of its own that sports a 2x zoom lens, similar to what you’d get on the iPhone X or Galaxy Note 8. It’s not anything I’d call essential, but it does give you a little more creative freedom when it comes to shooting stuff far away.Honor even caps everything off with a relatively large 3,750 mAh battery, which did a fine job in our rundown test as it kept the View 10 going for just over 10 hours (10:04 to be exact). That time compares pretty favorably to results from the Note 8 (10:13) and the iPhone x (9:56), though it’s still an hour short of the Pixel 2 XL (11:17), OP5T (11:22), and its more expensive sibling, the Mate 10 Pro (11:13), which were three of the longest lasting phones I tested last year. Is the Honor View 10 as sleek or tech-laden as the Galaxy Note 8 or iPhone X? No, and it’s not really that close. But as those phones continue to push the price of flagship devices even higher, they are also leaving a lot of people simply looking for a good device behind. And the Honor View 10 is just that, a solid phone with good specs, tons of storage, and some nice bonuses such as dual rear cams, a headphone jack and a bit a AI smarts. Now here’s hoping Honor stops sandbagging its US release, so that people can have even another good option for resisting the rise of the super premium smartphone. Not everyone wants a OnePlus 5T.

82,ZTE S,https://gizmodo.com/zte-s-ambitious-dual-screen-phone-shouldnt-exist-1820933104,"I really wanted to like the ZTE Axon M the first time I tried it. With the trend of smartphone screens getting bigger and longer, surely a phone sporting two screens instead of one would be even better right? Not only can you flip open the phone and multitask across the Axon M’s dual 5.2-inch displays, but with just a couple taps, you can combine the two screens into a giant 10.4-inch display. You can even close the displays halfway and turn the thing into a tent and use it as a mini presentation device, perfect for showing off all your crummy photos to friends and family. On top of that, the nature of the Axon M’s folding screen forced ZTE to work with Google to figure out how to make apps work across multiple screen sizes and ratios, which paves the way for the inevitable wave of phones with full on bendy screens. I applaud ZTE’s ambition for actually trying to sell this thing, but after a week of using it every day I’m sure that the $725 Axon M is a device that should have never left the concept lab.Out of the box, the first thing you notice about the Axon M is just how hefty this thing is. It measures just under half an inch thick and weighs more than half a pound—we’re talking serious brick-like stats here. But that isn’t the phone’s only ergonomic issue, as its entire right side is dominated by a big, bulky hinge. All of its physical controls, including the volume rocker and power button/fingerprint sensor, are on the other side. That might be nice for lefties, but it’s bad for everyone else. Furthermore, the Axon M’s fingerprint sensor is pretty hit or miss, often forcing me to enter my PIN instead. The most annoying thing is that when the fingerprint reader doesn’t work,  you need to press and hold down on the lock screen to access the PIN entry. What the hell was wrong with swipe to unlock? This is just being different for no good reason, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to turn it off. The best thing about the Axon M’s design is ZTE’s quick launch button, located on the lower left side of the phone, which by default is set to open video apps like YouTube or DirectTV, but can be easily reprogrammed to summon any app on your phone. It’s nice nod to customizability that even big names like Samsung and Google could learn from.But all of these things are just distractions that take away from the Axon M’s highlight feature: Its dual 5.2-inch full HD screens. Even after a hundred times, it’s still kind of exciting to flip  the phone open and see your screen real estate instantly double. And the panels themselves aren’t half bad either, featuring decent contrast and peak brightness north of 400 nits. And if you don’t want to use them as one giant 10.4-inch screen, you can always hit the M button down by the standard Android navs button to select mirrored, multi-tasking, or tent mode too.That said, there are also plenty of limitations to the Axon M’s dual screens. Mirror mode (which copies whatever is on the main display onto the second screen) is the only special mode that works when Axon M isn’t fully open. Also, when you’re multi-tasking, you can’t do stuff like play two games at the same time, because only one screen can be active. Anything happening on the other side gets paused. But the most disappointing thing is that when you combine the phone’s two 16:9 displays,  you end up with a square. That means anytime you’re watching a video, there are gigantic letter boxes on the top and bottom. It’s a huge waste of space, and despite what you may think, the bezel that runs down the middle  never gets easier to ignore.The rest of the components on the Axon M don’t earn much praise either. On our battery rundown test, it lasted 7 hours and 34 minutes, which is the shortest time we’ve seen this year, and even worse than the LG G6’s mark of 7:58. And that was in the Axon M’s traditional single screen mode. With both displays running, you’re looking at about half that.As for photos, since there’s a screen on either side of the phone, ZTE only put a single 20-MP camera on the Axon M. So instead of switching between front and rear camera, you just flip the phone depending on which direction you want to shoot. Unfortunately, that ends up being a lot more confusing than it sounds, especially when the screens don’t automatically switch based on your grip. But the real embarrassment comes from the Axon M’s low-light photos. The 20-MP camera simply doesn’t catch enough light, and even with night mode turned on, pics are significantly darker than what you get from similarly priced phones. Just check out that nighttime cityscape for a clear example.Look, I appreciate that ZTE really went for it, especially in a year when the hottest trend has been making screens a tiny bit wider and bezels a tiny bit smaller.

83,Razer Phone,https://gizmodo.com/razers-powerhouse-phone-for-gamers-is-delightfully-diff-1820817305,"While its original mission was to make high-end gaming mice, Razer’s line of products has grown over the years to include everything from keyboards and fitness bands to entire desktops, laptops, and pretty much anything else the company could put RGB lighting in. However, up until now, there was one glaring hole in Razer’s otherwise comprehensive lineup: phones. After all, more people spend time playing Candy Crush and Clash of Clans than even the most popular AAA PC titles. The problem  is that when a $200 Moto G5 can play Super Mario Run just as well as a $1000 iPhone X, WTF is a gaming phone even supposed to be?When you say “gaming phone,” the first things that come to mind are devices like the deeply flawed Nokia N-Gage or the much less clunky, but still wrong Sony Xperia Play, which combined traditional smartphone design with a built-in controller. But even the best of these devices never delivered the mobile gaming experience people wanted. So for its first phone, Razer did something a bit sneaky and made a handset for phone nerds instead of your average gamer.Now before you get all up in arms about me splitting hairs or asking what I’m talking about, think about it. Companies have tried making Game Boys crossed with mobile phones before to very little success. But by going after enthusiasts, Razer has a chance to stand out from the Apples, Samsungs, and LGs of the world, which are all making the same rounded, bezel-less pebbles with only very minor differences. On top of that, there’s actually a ton of overlap between what hardcore phone nerds value in a phone and the kind of things gamers want. Strong performance? Definitely, the $700 Razer Phone has the same Snapdragon 835 chip every other high-end Android phone is packing, along with 8GB of RAM, twice what you get in a Galaxy S8. A great screen? Sure, the Razer Phone’s display even features a refresh that goes up 120 Hz (more on that below). And then you top it all off with ridiculously loud speakers, a clean, but customizable take on Android thanks to Nova Launcher Prime (which is installed by default), and a large battery that provides the kind of longevity that even people who think all consoles are Nintendos can appreciate.As for the rest of the phone, the Razer  looks a lot like the Nextbit Robin, which the company acquired earlier this year and may have been the best looking phone of 2016. Razer supersized it with a burly aluminum body, boxy sides, and a big 5.7-inch screen. The result is something that has a dense, refreshingly brick-like feel. Even the bezels on top and bottom are big. But they aren’t wasted space, because in addition to holding the 8-megapixel selfie cam and tiny notification light, they also hide some of the richest and most powerful speakers any company has ever put in a phone. The Razer Phone actually sounds better than most small Bluetooth speakers and about as good as a Google Home or Amazon Echo. In fact, when I turned the volume up to max, it exposed the low quality audio in Clash Royale as it produced a myriad of crackles and pops, something I never heard when using other phones simply because they couldn’t get loud enough. While listening to music with the EQ in the Dolby Atmos app set to the appropriate mode, the Razer Phone pumped out surprisingly rich tunes. Unlike pretty much every other phone, the Razer  even has a bit of low-end kick, and it’s one of the few handsets from which I occasionally prefer using the speakers to plugging in headphones. This is a good thing, because one of the few important features Razer didn’t include on its handset is a headphone jack.It’s kind of a strange choice because even though Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan said that removing headphone jack made it possible to put in a bigger battery and improve thermal control for better performance., that still doesn’t solve the problem of what I’m supposed to when I want to recharge the phone while playing a game with headphones plugged in. As for battery life, the Razer Phone does quite well.  Over the course of the week, I had no problem getting a full-day’s use from the phone, even with multiple hours spent gaming. And in our battery rundown test, the Razer Phone lasted 9 hours and 19 minutes, which is  20 minutes longer than the standard Pixel 2 (8:59), but still behind the 10:21 mark set by the Galaxy Note 8. However, that test was run with its screen set to 90 Hz (which is how it comes out of the box), and higher than the 60 Hz you get from Samsung’s device. The Razer Phone is also the first phone to have Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 tech, even though the feature was officially revealed almost a year ago. This lets the Razer Phone go from zero to 36 percent battery in just half an hour, which is better than the 30 percent refill I got from the Galaxy Note 8 in the same time. That’s particularly impressive because the Razer Phone’s 4,000 mAh battery is 20 percent larger than the 3,300 battery in the Note 8.Then there’s the Razer Phone’s screen. Even though it’s not the brightest display ever, topping out at around 350 nits, what it lacks in luminance it makes up for with its variable 120 Hz refresh rate. Everything looks silky smooth, even little stuff like swiping down to open the notification tray or swiping up to see the app drawer. I’ll even admit that while testing the phone, I spent a good 10 minutes just flipping between pages on the home screen, mesmerized as app icons flowed fluidly across the display. The extra-high refresh rate also comes into play for gaming, because even though most apps are capped at 30 or 60 fps, Razer is working with developers like Nexon and Respawn to bring full 120 fps support to apps such as Titanfall Assault and others. And after spending a few minutes checking out the handful of apps that do take advantage of the tech, I found myself wishing every app could look this good.But don’t let my gushing be the only thing you hear because this phone is far from perfect. Aside from the lack of a headphone jack, my issues with the Razer phone come down to two small problems and one big one. First is the the side-mounted fingerprint reader. I like that it doesn’t take up space on the front of the phone, but its flush design makes it difficult to find by feel and a bit finicky to actually press. On our review unit, I also noticed that the plastic adhesive grille covering the top speaker has started to bubble and peel away from phone, which has me questioning the device’s durability. But the potential dealbreaker is the camera. Even after the first firmware update which was supposed to improve photo quality, everything still looks soft. In essentially ideal lighting, when I did a side-by-side photo shootout between the Razer Phone and the Galaxy Note 8, I struggled to find the focus in the Razer Phone’s pic. Meanwhile, the Note 8’s photo looks crisp, has richer colors, and simply captures a more appetizing shot than the Razer Phone. In other pics, I also noticed that the Razer Phone’s dynamic range fell behind that of the Note 8 too, which meant contrast was often lacking. Razer says  that more updates are coming to help bolster camera performance, but currently, its dual 12-megapixel rear cameras just don’t live up to the phone’s $700 price tag.Still, for its first foray into smartphones, the Razer Phone is a solid effort that zigs when every other phone is zagging. It’s almost offensively angular, it packs a mountain of RAM, and it sports an LCD display after even Apple has switched to AMOLED. And to top it all off, the Razer Phone’s 120 Hz display makes movies, games, and even the UI look smoother than any other phone on the market. It’s not perfect, but there’s a ton of potential, and even with the flaws on its first attempt, the Razer Phone deserves some credit for being delightfully different.Android 7.1.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor • 8GB of RAM • 64GB of storage • microSD card slot • 5.7-inch QHD IGZO LCD display with 120 Hz refresh rate • dual 12-MP rear cameras • 8-MP front camera • dual stereo speakers,802.11 a/b/g/n/ac wi-fi • Bluetooth 4.2 • Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 • 4,000 mAh battery • 6.24 x 3.06 x 0.31-inches • 6.94 ounces"
84,Oneplus 5t,https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5t-is-very-a-damn-good-phone-for-a-reasonab-1820596179,"The price of high-end smartphones has gotten out of control. The iPhone X starts at $1000, while Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8 retails at $950, and as much as I like nice things, ponying up that much for a phone is kind of ridiculous. Do we really need a notch that lets you turn your face into an animated pile of poop, or a stylus that won’t make your shitty stick figures look any better? But don’t fret, because it’s still possible to get a very good phone for a decent price. Starting at $500, or just $20 more than the  OnePlus 5 it’s replacing, the OnePlus 5T isn’t going to wow you with its looks. But I definitely wouldn’t call it ugly either. Instead of doing the glass sandwich thing that seems to be all the rage nowadays, the OP5 is one of the last phones still rocking aluminum in back. But that doesn’t mean OnePlus hasn’t been keeping up with the trends, because the OP5T has been upgraded with a 6-inch extra wide 18:9 screen that offers up almost 15 percent more screen real estate  in a body that’s practically the same size as before. Also, because the display is AMOLED and not LCD like you get on even cheaper budget phones, blacks are blacker, and colors are more colorfulThe OP5T also sports facial recognition, but not like the kind you get on the iPhone X, because you know, that’s expensive. Instead, OnePlus uses the 16-MP selfie camera that’s already on the front of phone to detect patterns in your face. Unfortunately, this also means it’s not very secure, as I managed to unlock the phone with a photo of my face, but it is fast.  When I first set facial recognition up, I wasn’t even sure if it was working because it would instantly open up the home screen after I pressed the lock button. It was only when I went out of my way to angle the phone away from my head that I realized the the the OP5T was recognizing my face and skipping the lock screen, in the blink of an eye. If you’re looking for better protection, you’ll be much better off sticking with the fingerprint reader, which has been moved to the back of the phone now that the front is all display. The last big change is how the OP5T’s dual rear cameras are set up. The old OP5 used its two cameras to offer a 1.6x zoom, which was nice for shooting concert or ballgames and stuff. But that kind of enhancement felt a bit weak compared to all the phones with true 2x zooms, and frankly the quality of the OP5 zoom shots were just OK. So on the the OP5T, the second 20-MP camera is now a dedicated lowlight shooter, which activates automatically at around 10 lux (which is about the same as a room lit by a candle). And you know what, it actually works. In a shot of my sad little fruit bowl, lit only by a few strategically placed candles, the OP5T’s pic looks sharper, noticeably less grainy, and has warmer, richer colors. It’s not a huge difference, but for people who spend of lot of time taking photos in bars or of food in poorly lit restaurants, it’s a nice bonus. But it’s not a win across the board. The camera’s good, but in other head-to-head comparisons, the OP5T didn’t consistently out shoot the S8's sharpness and detail. The OnePlus 5T also has the same Snapdragon 835 processor that’s in the Galaxy S8, Pixel 2 and pretty much every other flagship Android phone. Except on the OP5T, you get 6GB or 8GB of RAM (depending on the configuration), which means you can have way more apps running in the background before Android’s memory management starts to shut things down.How ‘bout battery life? OnePlus has you covered there too. On our battery rundown test, the OP5T lasted 11 hours and 22 minutes, barely longer than the Pixel 2 XL (11:17) and a healthy margin ahead of the Galaxy S8 (9:18). You even get handy small touches like the OnePlus’ volume slider, which is basically a better version of the iPhone’s mute switch, a dual sim tray, and neat software additions like the parallel apps feature which lets you install multiple versions of the same app. (It’s the perfect thing for keeping all your Instagram accounts properly separated.) And of course, OnePlus has smartly kept the headphone jack. No dongles needed here.Now I would have liked to see OnePlus try to include a microSD card slot and wireless charging. OnePlus says it’s Dash Charge should make up for the latter, and it’s true, you can recharge your phone’s battery up to about 50 percent in just 20 minutes or so. But wireless charging isn’t about speed, it’s about convenience. Out of the box, the OP5T won’t be running Android 8 Oreo either. Though you won’t have to wait too long to get it, since OnePlus is prepping an update for sometime in early 2018. It’s not ideal, but still, these are things I can live with, especially since the wireless charging would almost surely add to the price.The OP5T also doesn’t have an official rating for water-resistance either, which could be a deal breaker for some. However, the company says this is more due to the cost and time required to get the phone tested and certified, and that the OP5T can actually survive a quick dip in the sink without trouble. But if your phone does get dunked and doesn’t survive, there’s no warranty to fall back on. So even though I’ve been personally assured the OP5T should survive, I’m not quite willing to risk the possibility that it won’t, and you shouldn’t either.But in a time when it feels like the smartphone industry has gone crazy about fancy features, the OnePlus 5T is return to sanity. It’s not super pretty or especially sleek, but for $500, it’s a damn fine phone. And it just might  be the best value around.OxygenOS based on Android 7.1 • 6-inch 18:9 aspect ratio full HD AMOLED display • Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor • 6GB of RAM • 64GB of storage • 16-MP f/1.7 + 20-MP f/1.7 dual rear cams • 16-MP f/2.0 front cam • USB 2.0 Type-C port • 3.5mm audio jack • 3,300 mAh battery • dual sim tray • no microSD slot or wireless charging"
85,Huaweis Mate 10 Pro,https://gizmodo.com/huaweis-mate-10-pro-is-a-valiant-attempt-to-slay-the-ip-1820480251,"A few months ago, Huawei passed Apple to become the second largest smartphone maker in the world, (Samsung’s number one). Yet you don’t see Huawei ads on TV in the United States, and its phones are seldom sold in any of the big carrier stores. Even when they are, they are often hidden behind a bigger brands like on the Nexus 6P. Shit, most Americans can’t even say the name of the company properly (it’s hwah-way, btw). The company isn’t a known entity in the US, but that won’t stop it from releasing new phones. Its latest flagship handset, the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, comes complete with its own homegrown silicon that Huawei claims should make its smartphone the most intelligent.  It isn’t.With its new Kirin 970 processor, our Mate 10 Pro review unit with 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage is definitely fast, and with a body constructed out of glass on front and back and held together by a polished strip of aluminum, the phone feels quite luxurious too. But after using it every day for more than a week, I’m still struggling to figure out how the phone’s AI, machine learning and built-in neural processing unit elevate it above a Pixel 2, iPhone X or any other “smart” phone.Part of the problem is that certain aspects of Huawei’s programming  can only have a measurable impact months down the line. Huawei claims algorithms baked into the Mate 10 Pro should let you avoid the typical three to six-month post purchase slowdown. Maybe it will!There’s also Huawei’s partnership with Microsoft to provide a custom version of the Microsoft Translator app. It should be powered, in part, by the Mate 10 Pro’s Neural Processing Unit. You take a picture of some text or simply speak into the phone, and the app spits out a translation for you likety split. But the app doesn’t always get it right, and compared to using something like Google Translate, it’s still unclear if the Mate 10 Pro’s NPU gives a real advantage. Huawei also went the extra mile by including support for machine learning platforms such as Facebook’s Caffe 2 and Google’s Tensor Flowlite machine learning platforms, alongside their own AI framework. But that potential can only be realized after people have had time to develop apps designed to utilize the Mate 10 Pro’s NPU. Which they haven’t, so it’s just another bet on a future that may, or may not pay off. At least all the AI and neural processing works in the camera app. The camera can identify 13 different scenes or objects including flowers, plants, beach, food, nighttime, text, cats and dogs, and then automatically adjust the camera’s settings to help you capture the best picture possible. You know it’s working, because when the phone detects a subject it knows how to enhance, a corresponding icon will pop up in the camera’s UI.Those little tweaks can make a big difference too. In a side by side comparison between the Mate 10 Pro and the iPhone X, Huawei’s AI-powered camera added some real drama to an otherwise typical shot of a cold rainy night in NYC. The iPhone X’s photo more or less captured what I saw, but the Mate 10 Pro’s photo captured what I wanted to see. The sky in the Mate’s photo had less of the hazy redness you see in the iPhone’s pic, the various streetlights and decorations are sharper and less blown out, even the street looks wetter. Now some may say this blurs the line between accuracy and interpretation, but given the choice, I’d pick the Mate 10 Pro’s photo every time.However, other times, like when I snapped a pic of the Empire State Building, the AI failed to recognize anything it could enhance, even though it seemed like it should. Apparently it wasn’t dark enough to classify as a nightscape, and the backdrop wasn’t right for activating the phone’s Blue Sky mode. But it’s November in New York, it’s going to look gray and dreary like this for the next four months, which means the camera’s AI is useless if it can’t adjust. To that end, Huawei says its constantly feeding more images through its machine learning software and hopes to update the its phones with new AI modes over time. But it could be slow going.That said, even when the AI doesn’t step in an help out, the phone still has solid hardware to fall back on. It’s the first phone  featuring two cameras with f/1.6 aperture lenses (the LG V30’s main cam is f/1.6, but its wide-angle camera is not), and the combo 12 megapixel RGB sensor and 20 megapixel monochrome sensor still work together so you can adjust depth of field from super shallow all the way to infinity. The results are quite good too, often keeping pace with Portrait mode shots from the iPhone X. Although as seen in the NYC shots above, photos from the Mate 10 Pro tend to come out slightly underexposed compared to pics from Apple’s $1,000 phone.So if the Mate 10 Pro’s AI smarts, outside of photography, aren’t all they’re cracked up to be, what is it like as a “normal” smartphone? Quite nice! The big 5.9-inch 18:9 OLED screen is vibrant and bordered on top and bottom by some deliciously thin bezels. There’s also a fingerprint sensor around back, and IP67 water-resistance to make sure the phone can survive a quick dip or two. And it lasted 11 hours and 13 minutes on our battery rundown test, which is practically the same as the Pixel 2 XL (11:17), and noticeably better than the Galaxy Note 8 (10:21) and iPhone X (9:56).Huawei has even included a handful of nifty tricks, like the Mate 10 Pro’s ability to function as a (Android-based) desktop PC just by hooking it up to an external display using a USB-C or USB-C to DisplayPort cable. From there, all you have to do is pair a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and off you go. There’s even a secret mode that lets you sign into different accounts on your phone depending on which finger you use to unlock it. There’s still one big bummer. Want a headphone jack? Sorry, that’s only available on the standard Mate 10, which by the way also has a higher resolution display. That’s crap. The Pro should have everything the base model has and more. Let people who want to save money figure out what kind of compromises they are willing to make.Which brings us to price. Huawei says this phone is definitely coming to the US, but hasn’t announced anything official yet. Based on the timeline for last year’s Mate 9, I’m expecting Huawei to make a splash with a US debut at CES 2018 in early January. And if it arrives costing around $800 like its Euro pricing would imply, we’re looking at a pretty nice alternative to other 6-inch phones like the LG V30, Pixel 2 XL or even the Galaxy Note 8. But any more and Huawei is really pushing it, because until the phone gets smarter, the AI hasn’t demonstrated a ton of value.EMUI 8 running Android 8 • Kirin 970 CPU • 4GB RAM • 64GB storage • microSD card slot • 18:9 6-inch 2160 x 1080 OLED display • 12-MP RGB/20-MP monochrome rear camera with f/1.6 aperture • 8-MP f/2.0  front cam • 5.9 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches • 6.56 ounces • colors: brown, black, champagneAI camera modes: blue sky, flower, plant, beach, sunrise/sunset, performance, food, text, nightscape snow, cat, dog, portrait."
86,iPhone X,https://gizmodo.com/i-hate-how-much-i-love-the-iphone-x-1820086867,"I’m a total gadget nerd, and it’s been five years since a new smartphone made me nod to myself with the understanding that, “Yes, I need that thing more than I need air.” But the buzz around the iPhone X has had me a little more hyped than usual. Not just because the iPhone finally ditched the bezels and got an OLED display—Samsung’s Galaxy S8 lost its bezels in March—but because the iPhone X is the line’s first significant overhaul since god knows when. I should know better than to fall for the hype, but after spending nearly a week with the device,  I’ve actually convinced myself that spending $1,000 on a phone seems like a good idea. If you hate me for saying that, that’s okay, I hate me too.The display is clearly the first thing you notice, and if not for the famed notch, it would merely be as impressive as a Samsung Galaxy S8 or Note 8. The colors aren’t as vibrant as what you’ll find on a Samsung phone—Samsung phones tend to oversaturate the colors—but as someone who prefers accuracy over eye-bleeding pop, I really like how naturally the iPhone renders colors.But let me just say: I love the distinctive notch. Some consider it an eyesore, but for me, that notch screams the phone’s ostentation in a deeply satisfying way. It gives the whole 5.8-inch display a sense of space that simply isn’t found on competing phones. In fact, its display is actually larger than the 5.5-inch screen on the physically larger iPhone 8 Plus. Where the screen curves around the front camera module, it feels a little like Apple has somehow cheated and rewarded the phone with more visual real estate than it deserves—at least while you’re on the home screen or in apps specifically updated to work with the iPhone X’s unique display. In other apps, the iPhone X feels a little small, with the a black band at the top and bottom of the display confining what was once expansive feeling.The big display doesn’t dramatically affect battery life too much. I never found myself wanting more power throughout the day, and I even went into day two with regular use. In our battery rundown test, in which we stream a YouTube video over wi-fi until the phone dies, the iPhone X managed a little less than 10 hours, which is perfectly average battery life when compared to all the phones Gizmodo’s tested this year, and thanks to its ability to charge quickly and wirelessly, it’s never an issue to rejuice it.What surprised me most about the phone is how I don’t miss Touch ID or the home button.  Since the first rumors cropped up that Touch ID might not make it to Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone, I’ve obsessed over the shift from the fingerprint tech. How could they possibly do it! It became a reality, and like many people, I was  aghast that the technology would be forever replaced by Face ID. Instead of pressing your finger to a home button, you now glance at the phone and quickly swipe up with your thumb.Over the last few days, I’ve spent hours fiddling with the front-facing “TrueDepth” setup that makes the Face ID magic possible. It’s by far the most technologically innovative aspect of the phone. It uses a combination of a camera, IR lasers, and IR scanner to create a 3D map of your face. The camera allows you to create animoji, and gives apps like Snapchat access to your facial map so they can toss realistic-looking masks on your face.But the killer feature is obviously Face ID. I look at the phone, and it opens instantly. From there it works like an even fancier version of Touch ID. When I went to sign into Twitter, it recognized my face and  logged me in. When I ordered a midnight burger off Seamless, and used Apple Pay, it scanned my face before asking me to press the power button to confirm the purchase.While at first there were some hiccups, the TrueDepth camera has learned my face since I picked the phone up from Apple on Monday. And now it doesn’t hesitate when I try to use it in the dark, or while wearing sludgey makeup, or huddled on a bench at the dog park in the morning with my hoody pulled down low. This camera gets me, and I don’t even have to hold it up directly in front of my face. As long as the camera is pointed in my face’s direction, and I’m looking at it, the phone will open.The rear cameras on the iPhone X can’t do anything that cool. They’re still very nice, but if you’re trying to decide between the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus or the iPhone X, it won’t be the rear cameras that sway you.The reason you buy the iPhone X is because of that too luxurious design, and that audaciously hedonistic display, and that super cool depth-sensing selfie camera. This phone isn’t remaking the way we think about phones in as grand a manner as the original iPhone, or even the iPhone 4. While Face ID could be the future of biometric tech on phones, that future won’t shift your world view as dramatically as the move from passcodes to biometrics in the first place. The iPhone X isn’t a leap into a new world of phone design, it’s just a showcase for what a really expensive luxury phone should look and feel like. I don’t need the $1,000 iPhone X, but after spending the last few days with it, boy do I want to go buy one."
87,HTC U11,https://gizmodo.com/htcs-new-midrange-phone-proves-the-company-isnt-dead-ye-1820053080,"Even though Google recently purchased a billion dollars of personnel and intellectual property from HTC, the Taiwanese smartphone maker isn’t dead yet. In fact, today HTC announced two new phones: the new U11 Plus and the U11 Life. Unfortunately, folks here in the States are only going to have access to the latter, as the 6-inch U11 Plus with its larger 18:9 display and bigger battery is destined only for Asian and European markets. But maybe that’s OK, because with a price tag of just $350, the U11 Life might be the more enticing of the two. That’s because as the prices of flagship phones continue to rise, the phones in the middle are going to be the ones that put the burden on the iPhone Xs and Galaxy Note 8s of the world to prove that they are worth spending three or four times more on something that might be only marginally better. And in a lot of cases, more and more people are finding that they can function just fine with something that costs well under $600.In a lot of ways, the U11 Life is almost the perfect mid-range handset. You still get the same curvy body and squeezable sides found on HTC ‘s more expensive flagship, which sports IP67 water resistance, but with a smaller 5.2-inch full HD display (instead of the 5.5-inch QHD panel that comes on the standard U11). The difference this time is that the back is made from acrylic instead of glass, which still feels tough and just as slippery as before, although if you press hard, you’ll notice a slight flex it’s more expensive sibling doesn’t have.In front, the Life features some pretty sizable bezels above and the below the screen, though the presence of a chin-mounted fingerprint sensor/home button and two additional capacitive touch controls makes you feel a bit better about all the extra space. Meanwhile, on the inside, the U11 Life has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 CPU, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and microSD expandability. The one thing that’s missing though is a headphone jack, which is bad enough on an expensive flagship phone, but even worse HTC attempts to remedy this by including a pair of its USB-C USonic headphones in the box. And while I would still like a 3.5mm jack too, HTC’s earbuds sound fantastic. Not only do these buds have built-in noise canceling, which is a relief for city-dwellers like me trying to escape the ever-present sounds of traffic, subways, or construction, they totally eliminated the clicking and clacking I heard from my coworkers typing next to me in our office. The U11 Life even works together with the buds to create a personalized audio profile to further enhance your listening experience, which let HTC’s pack-in earbuds (which the company values at around $40) deliver fuller, richer audio than the $140 B&O H3 earbuds I usually use. The downside is that if you scrounge up a USB-C to 3.5mm dongle and swap in another set of headphones, all that extra sound enhancement goes away. Another sad thing about the U11 Life, is that it forgoes HTC’s legacy of powerful stereo speakers by going with a single speaker mounted on the bottom of the phone that puts out just mediocre sound.As for the Life’s photo prowess, it surprised me with  pics that are definitely above average for something in this price range. When compared side-by-side with a similarly priced phone like the $400 Moto X4, as expected, both phones performed admirably in the daytime. However, for people looking for a tiny bit more detail, the Life’s 16-megapixel rear camera does have a slight advantage over the 12-megapixel cam in the Moto x4. But the real differences appeared when I used both phones to shoot some spooky Halloween decorations. Sure, the HTC’s photo is more under-exposed than the Moto X4’s, but the U11 Life’s is noticeably less noisy, features better color saturation, and is generally sharper that its competition.In a time when phone prices are getting increased to ludicrous levels, the U11 Life is refreshingly simple. It’s got all the standard features you’d expect on a modern phone like a fingerprint sensor and water-resistance, along with a few bonuses thanks to its included noise canceling earbuds and Edge Sense pressure controls. I just wish HTC had made room for a headphone jack.

88,Pixel 2,https://gizmodo.com/pixel-2-review-google-sticks-to-what-it-does-best-1819557944,"When Google released the Pixel last year, it was taking a stand. No longer would Google hardware be tainted with the brands and logos of other companies, even if behind the scenes, Google still needed help from those same companies to actually build its phones. And despite designs that were almost offensively ugly, a lack of standard flagship features such as water-resistance and expandable storage, and massive supply chain problems that made it hard to actually buy one months after its initial release, there were bright spots like the Pixel’s excellent HDR photo mode and an untainted Android experience.But now, 12 months down the road and with $1 billion of newly acquired tech and personnel, it’s imperative for Google to take the next steps in maturing as a device maker if it wants to makes those bets on homegrown hardware actually pay off.And at first glance, it seems like Google is delivering. Both the 5-inch Pixel 2 and 6-inch Pixel 2 XL come with IP67 water-resistance, colorful OLED screens, Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and 4GB of RAM, which is pretty much identical to what you get from every other high-end Android phone. Around back, both phones also sport a new, matte finish, with care taken to ensure that even the little circle on the fingerprint reader gets a matching texture, while still retaining what has, for better or worse, become Google’s signature rear glass window. It’s a more fined take on the original Pixels ham-fisted design that’s kind of attractive in its simplicity. But after that, things start to fall apart. Little details like the reversed camera locations on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL and the varying treatments on the Google logo chip away at the pair’s cohesive family resemblance. And then you flip the two around, it becomes a story of two very different phones. The bezels on the standard 5-inch Pixel 2 are massive, and easily the biggest on any flagship phone released in 2017 aside from the iPhone 8. On top of that, the Pixel 2 lacks the curvier glass edges of its larger sibling, which when combined with its 16:9 aspect ratio (versus the 18:9 screen on the Pixel 2 XL), gives the standard Pixel 2 a clunkier, chunkier appearance that looks dated from day one. What’s even worse is that the standard Pixel 2’s 2,750 mAh battery delivers significantly less battery life than the 3,520 mAh battery on the larger Pixel 2 XL. On our battery rundown test, the Pixel 2 lasted just 8 hours and 59 minutes, almost 15 minutes short of the Galaxy S8’s time of 9:12 and more than two hours short of the Pixel 2 XL’s mark of 11:17. This is real shame, because based on size alone, the standard Pixel 2 is easily a better fit for my hands and other people who prefer smaller phones. However, the disparities between it and the Pixel XL 2 makes the larger phone the much better buy even when you consider the latter’s $200 higher price tag.By comparison, the Pixel 2 XL looks like it has been hitting the gym. It’s slimmer bezels and higher screen-to-body-ratio makes it looks leaner. However, even the 2 XL isn’t without its problems. When viewed off-axis, the Pixel 2 XL’s POLED screen has a noticeable blue tint, which is something you don’t see on the standard Pixel 2 and when viewed head on, images on the Pixel XL 2 can sometimes have a slight greenish hue too.I’m annoyed by Google’s decision to eliminate the headphone jack from the Pixel 2’s list of features. Even with the wireless connectivity and the inclusion of a 3.5mm dongle in the box, I think it’s still too soon for phone makers to be axing the headphone jack. On the flipside, the return of front-facing stereo speakers is welcome addition, and I’m glad that at least one company is keeping the legacy of HTC alive (especially since HTC can’t seem to get it together).So if their design isn’t anything special, what do the Pixel 2s have to offer? The software. Without any skins, bloat or other alterations to Android getting in the way, the Pixel 2 puts the full force of Google’s smart programming in your hand. Whether it’s Google Photos silently editing and creating custom albums based on the photos you shoot, or at-a-glance notifications providing helpful updates on the weather, your commute, or other timely info, the pure Android Oreo 8.0 that you only get on Pixel devices is the closest thing we’ve seen to a smart OS.New for this year is a revamped home screen layout which puts a Google search bar at the bottom of the screen (and critically closer to your fingers). And if you’re too lazy to type, now you can simply squeeze the side of the phone to summon the Google Assistant and voice your queries instead. Google calls this feature Active Edge and while it’s a bit of gimmick, it’s also a nice alternative to having to call out vocally to Google every time.That said, I have to knock Google for restricting the Active Edge to Google Assistant. It’s pretty much the same tactic that got people riled up when Samsung added a dedicated Bixby button to the side of the Galaxy S8. So let me be clear: Google did a great thing when it added a new way for people to interact with their phones, and then it did a bad thing by locking it down instead of making it into a customizable feature.It’s not the first phone you squeeze to control (that’s the HTC U11), but the Pixel 2 is the first phone with Google Lens, which can analyze pictures you’ve taken and tell you whether the flower you just shot is a peony or a garden cosmos. And while it doesn’t work every time, or might not always be precise as you’d like (e.g. when it identifies a Ferrari 458 as just a “supercar”), when it gets things right, it’s downright impressive.Speaking of photos, the Pixel 2’s 12-megapixel rear camera still does wonders considering it’s f/1.8 aperture and single camera setup isn’t exactly the fanciest system. In both bright light and normal low-light conditions, the Pixel 2 is every bit of a match for the Galaxy S8 and iPhone 8, and sometimes, thanks to its superb HDR+ mode, the Pixel 2 is better. Take for example the above shots of some lovely autumn pumpkins. While the S8’s photo is good, and hardly worth complaining about, the Pixel 2 did even better, capturing richer oranges and more details on their gnarled stems. Or check out this shot of some delicious Cantonese chicken. While the iPhone 8’s pic might look more well exposed at first, things like the teapot and rice bowl in background are blown out, something the Pixel 2 manages to avoid.The one area where the Pixel 2 starts to lag is in extreme low-light environments, such as scenes lit only by candlelight. It’s here where the Pixel 2’s hardware hits it limit, which results in softer, less detailed, and often noisier photos than what you’d get from its competitors.This camera lacks in low light, but usually it’s good enough you don’t have to think about the photos you’re taking, and, in a way, that’s really emblematic of what seems to be Google’s overall approach to its homegrown hardware. Like a microwave or a washing machine, the idea that a device’s specs and hardware get out of the way and take a back seat to whatever you’re actually trying to get done. Then Google’s software can step in quietly to give you a helping hand when it can, which is surprisingly often). Hell, the most interesting new feature on the Pixel 2, the Active Edge pressure sensor, is something you can’t even see, you just have to squeeze and know that the phone will respond. I just wish Google hadn’t punted on the standard Pixel 2’s design and battery life so hard. The second-gen Pixel XL is kind of handsome in a simple, stoic way, especially on that black and white model with the orange power button. Meanwhile, the regular Pixel 2 feels like it got neglected. Either way, you’re not buying this phone for its build or its style, you’re getting it because you think Google’s software has the answers. And more often than any of its competitors, it does.

89,Asus Zenfone 4 Max,https://gizmodo.com/this-cheap-smartphone-has-a-ridiculous-battery-and-it-1819196297,"Battery life is the number one concern when people think about buying a new smartphone, to the point that if a phone had nearly double the longevity of even the most expensive flagship handsets, it would be easy to overlook some of its faults. But at some point deficiencies start to drag down the novelty of having a really big  battery, which is precisely the problem with the Asus ZenFone 4 Max. This thing has one of the biggest batteries you can find in a smartphone—and it’s only $200! Yet budget components take all the fun out of it. I don’t feel like I ask for much when it comes to budget phones: I’m mainly looking for a solid build and quality components new enough to not make the handset feel dated. At first glance, the $200 ZenFone 4 Max seems to fit the bill. It’s got a mostly aluminum build with a big 5.5-inch screen, a built-in fingerprint sensor and even dual cameras in back, a feature that’s all the rage among phone makers nowadays. Asus also gave the ZenFone 4 Max a card tray with room for two nano SIMs and a microSD card, so you don’t have to choose between easy multi-country cell service and expandable storage.You even get capacitive touch buttons for Back and Recent apps, which would normally seem a bit weird in an Android ecosystem that’s slowly trying to kill off anything that isn’t onscreen nav buttons. However, considering all the room next to the ZenFone 4 Max’s front home button/fingerprint reader, I’ll take those touch buttons as a welcome addition. But there are other a number of features on the ZenFone 4 Max that feel off on a phone in 2017. Asus’ use of a micro USB port instead of USB-C is simply not OK, and saddling a display this big with a 1280 x 720 resolution is almost criminal. Say what you want about optimal pixel density, but when I hold the phone reasonable distance a from my face (one to one and a half feet), I shouldn’t be able to see how the screen’s big pixels make text and pictures look rough and jagged. Then there’s the ZenFone 4's clunky skin for Android Nougat (last year’s build of Android), which with its huge icons, pastel color palette and massive text looks like it was made for children or octogenarians—I can’t figure out which. (Thankfully you can partially address my last two complaints using the phone’s included theme app and adjust the font size setting.)And there’s the matter of the ZenFone 4 Max’s dual rear cameras. In bright light, the main 13-MP camera is fine, but at night you start to run into a lot of issues with noise, graininess, and a general lack of sharpness. But what really annoys me is the secondary 5-MP wide angle cam. In pretty much anything other than well-lit outdoor environments, its performance is disappointing. Shots come out very underexposed to the point where it’s hard to make out one object from another, and then you add in some significant fisheye distortion and you’d often left with a pic that’s not good enough to share anywhere. If you’re not going to make the second camera worth using, don’t put it on the phone at all.I should also mention the ZenFone 4 Max’s performance. Even on most budget phones today, there’s enough processing power to keep most people happy. However, when I can literally count up to three Mississippi between tapping the shutter and being able to take a second HDR photo, it makes me feel like I should just put the phone down and be like “Don’t worry, I’ll wait.”But this phone exists because of the giant battery, not because of an ugly display or bad cameras. Thanks to a whopping 5,000 mAh capacity, the ZenFone 4 Max lasted 16 hours and 13 minutes on our battery test, which is way longer than what we saw from the Samsung Galaxy S8 (9:12) and Galaxy Note 8 (10:21), and double the longevity of the LG G6 (7:28) and Moto Z2 Force (8:42). And since it’s actually pretty hard to kill the ZenFone Max 4 in a single day, Asus thoughtfully included a reverse charging feature (and a cable), so you can use the phone’s excess juice to recharge other devices like a camera or someone else’s less resilient handset. The only problem is that if those other devices use something besides micro USB port for charging, you’re going to have to carry around extra adapters. (That’s another reason Asus should have gone with USB-C). And for those who might think a phone with a battery this big would take a while to recharge, you’re partially right. If you use something other than the included charger, it’s a crapshoot. When I connected the ZenFone 4 Max to my work laptop for recharging, power transfer was as fast as molasses. However, when plugged into the wall, the ZenFone 4 Max went from 25 percent charge to 44 percent in 30 minutes, which might not sound quite as impressive as the Note 8's recharge rate, which went from 25 percent to 55 percent in the same time. But when you consider that the ZenFone 4 Max’s battery is 40 percent larger than the Note 8's 3500 mAh power pack, you realize that’s actually pretty good.So now we’re back to our original dilemma: how much is amazing battery life worth to you? If it wasn’t for the ZenFone 4 Max’s ridiculous longevity, its other flaws would have ruled it out completely. And even when you factor that 5,000 mAh battery back in, there’s at least three other phones in this price range I’d rather have. The Moto G5 Plus has a smaller screen, but its got way better performance, and it’s compatible with every major carrier, while the ZTE Blade V8 Pro and Honor 6X are both more well rounded handsets that do a better job of making you care about budget phones with dual cameras. The ZenFone 4 Max’s battery life might be extraordinary, but the rest of the phone is anything but.Android 7.1 • 5.5-inch 1280 x 720 LCD screen • Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 CPU •  Adreno 505 GPU • 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage • built-in fingerprint sensor • 8-MP front camera • 13-MP main rear camera/5-MP 120-degree wide angle secondary rear camera • 802.11b/g/n wi-fi • Bluetooth 4.1 • dual SIM+microSD card slots • micro USB port • headphone jack • 5,000 mAh battery with reverse charging • no water-resistance"
90,iPhone 8,https://gizmodo.com/one-week-with-the-iphone-8-1818736319,"This year, Apple broke from tradition and introduced two totally new iPhones: the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X. What’s up with that? As cool as the iPhone X looks, the iPhone 8 is still a fantastic device. That in mind, you’re probably reading this review to answer a two-part question: Should I buy an iPhone 8 now, or should I wait a couple months for the iPhone X? Here’s my answer: It’s complicated.The iPhone X and its edge-to-edge screen was the star of the show a couple weeks ago, but that hype shouldn’t belie the fact that the slightly redesigned iPhone 8 is an impressive piece of hardware that offers most of the same features—for a lot less money. And after spending a week with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, I realize that the cheaper phones are going to be perfect for a ton of people. If you saw an iPhone 8 on the street, you’d probably think it was an iPhone 7. The phone’s overall design is the same, but on the outside, you’ll notice that the iPhone 8 has a glass back instead of a metal one. It almost just looks like it’s been painted with a glossy lacquer, like nail polish. The differences between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 8 are otherwise less visible. According to Apple, the iPhone 8 is built with “the most durable glass ever in a smartphone.” (Some stress tests suggest that the improvement is marginal, and the iPhone 8 glass can still scratch and shatter.) The Retina display itself also features something called True Tone technology which adjusts the screen’s white balance in different environments. This feature is very noticeable when looking at the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 7 side-by-side, and I believe it is easier on the eyes.The iPhone 8 camera is improved with a bigger 12-megapixel camera as well as a better flash and better optical image stabilization. The iPhone 8 Plus has a new software feature in beta called Portrait Lighting, a gimmick in my opinion, but a fun one. The processor—and this is neat—is a new six-core A11 Bionic chip that’s optimized for photography and augmented reality apps. Finally, the iPhone 8 has Qi wireless charging.Most people use their phones for a lot of simple things and a handful of complex ones. You probably text a lot, check your email, and make actual phone calls. (Quick note: Apple has admitted that there’s a problem with crackling noise when taking calls through the earpiece, but a fix is on the way.) You probably use fairly basic apps for stuff like social media, banking, or reading the news. You take photos and the occasional video. And you might play some games that require some heavy-lifting on the processor’s part.If you’re currently using an iPhone 7 or any recent flagship Android, you probably won’t notice much of a difference in how the iPhone 8 handles these day-to-day tasks. But at certain times of day, usually when I was playing Sim City, it’s obvious that the A11 Bionic processor in the iPhone 8 is a snarling beast of a chip. The Sim City app itself loads twice as fast on the iPhone 8 than it does on my old iPhone 7. The gameplay is also smooth on the newer device, whereas I’m used to annoying stutters when moving around my sad, fictional metropolis on an iPhone 7. What’s really new is augmented reality, and this is where the A11 Bionic processor should really matter. Tinkering around with the limited number of AR games currently in the App Store is fun as hell on the iPhone 8. The Machines, that game we saw on stage at the iPhone event, is brilliantly complex and realistic. It transformed my living room into a futuristic battlefield almost instantaneously, and the gameplay was just as smooth as my old standby, Sim City, on the iPhone 8. Similarly, Monster Park, Giphy, and Ikea Place all offered the best AR experiences I’ve ever had with no lag at all.The only thing is, these AR games performed pretty well on my iPhone 7 as well. This is likely due, in part, to Apple building great software in iOS 11 to offer great AR games on as many devices as possible, regardless of their specs. Generally, though, Apple says that the improved performance in the A11 Bionic chip will make AR apps more stable and render richer details. And the new A11 Bionic chip (left) did smoke the A10 Fusion chip (right) in our benchmark tests.Another barely noticeable upgrade on the iPhone 8 is the camera. Like the iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 features a 12-megapixel, f/1.8 aperture camera. The specs for both models are identical on Apple’s website. In fact, the only difference in the specs for the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus is the addition of the Portrait Lighting mode—which is still in beta, by the way—for the iPhone 8 Plus. However, the teardown from iFixit shows that Apple does include a slightly larger sensor in the iPhone 8 series. This means deeper pixels and richer colors as well as better low light performance. The teardown also revealed four magnets in the camera that go towards improved optical image stabilization. Otherwise, the new camera leans on the A11 Bionic chip for better image processing.While it’s nice that Apple did some hardware and software upgrades for the iPhone 8 camera, most people probably won’t notice the difference in their photos. I took a series of identical shots with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 in a variety of settings (sunny day, cloudy day, low light, total darkness), and even as someone trained to spot improved image quality, I have to squint and turn my head to see the difference between the two generations of iPhone cameras. The difference does exist. But boy, oh boy, is it specific to certain situations. All of the photos below were taken at the same time with both the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 7 cameras. In brief, the iPhone 8 does indeed produce richer colors in certain situations. The new camera also performs slightly better in low light conditions. And that new flash is a lot better. If we’re just talking about image quality difference between the last generation of iPhone and this one—I can’t see them. I can slightly see some improvements in the flash, but the flash is the component of the camera I use the least, so I don’t really care. You ready for this? You’re about to read a series of words I didn’t think I would write. And I’m humbled to be writing them.The best thing about the iPhone 8 is… wireless charging. In fact, I would argue that it’s almost worth the price of an upgrade for lazy bums like me. I should also add that I expected to be thoroughly unimpressed by the newfound ability to slap an iPhone on a wireless charging pad and top up the battery. Android phones have done this for years! It’s not that hard to plug in a charger! Wireless charging is, however, incredibly convenient, if you’ve got the right set up.My charging habits are pretty routine, which is largely why I thought wireless charging would be a moot feature. I plug in my phone at bed time. I unplug it in the morning. If it gets low, I plug it in at my office. Now that overnight charge is easy: plug in the phone, unplug it when I wake up. Have I reached for my phone in the middle of the night and forgotten that it’s plugged in and knocked a glass of water onto the floor causing shattering and chaos. Yes, I have. But for the most part, that’s not the issue. Having a wireless charging pad at my office is a game changer. I can plop my iPhone on the pad while I’m at my desk, grab it to run to a meeting, come back, plop, repeat until charged.By now, it should be obvious that I like the iPhone 8. I like it slightly more than my iPhone 7, and I like it a lot more than my old iPhone 6. So here’s the rundown of what I’d do if I were you and considering buying a new iPhone.If you want the iPhone X, wait six weeks and buy it. Good luck with that, too, because there will almost surely be shortages. It will also cost you at least $1,000.If you have an iPhone 7, and you like it—and it works—you don’t need the iPhone 8. You might want it, and if you can’t help yourself, you might buy the iPhone 8. But you don’t need it. Aside from wireless charging, your old iPhone 7 does everything almost as well as the iPhone 8. Wait for the iPhone 9 or whatever Apple’s going to release next year.If you have an iPhone 6 or older, you should want the iPhone 8. The new design, improved camera, more powerful processor, as well as the addition of wireless charging will rock your world. Depending on how long you’ve had your old device and how much your battery has crapped out, the improved battery life will change your life, too. The iPhone 8 clocked almost 13 hours of video playback in our tests, and iPhone 8 Plus got slightly more. More than anything, though, the iPhone 8 is a good way to future proof your phone life for a couple years. Better devices will obviously hit the market, but the iPhone 8 is as good as they get right now. At least it is for the next six weeks, when the iPhone X starts to ship."
91,Galaxy Note 8,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-bigger-badder-but-i-sti-1799759566,"Forgive me for passing up the chance to beat the exploding battery joke into the ground. Let’s get straight to the point: Samsung’s once dominant flagship phablet is back after a two year hiatus. Sporting a stunning extra-widescreen 18.5:9 display, the new Galaxy Note 8 is bigger and more engaging than ever before, and it packs a larger power pack than any Note besides the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7 too. But a lot has changed since 2015—especially when you consider that starting at $930, the new Note 8 is now more expensive than ever. That means there are two questions it needs to answer: Does the Galaxy Note 8 still make sense in 2017, and can it possibly be worth damn near $1,000?At first glance, the answer might be no. The Note 8’s 6.3-inch 2960 x 1440 super AMOLED display is insignificantly larger than the 6.2-inch screen on the S8 Plus (though that bezel-less design remains strikingly pretty), and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, 64GB of storage and built-in microSD card reader aren’t any different either. Aside from slightly boxier corners, the Note 8’s luscious glass and aluminum body is pretty much the same too. You even get the same annoying Bixby Button below the volume rocker, which still can’t be remapped to something useful.The one small improvement is that Samsung has upped the Note 8's RAM from 4GB to 6GB, which is  nice nod to the Galaxy Note’s traditional fan base of power users. However, on a day-to-day basis, it’s an improvement that isn’t always that noticeable (despite benchmarks that put the Note 8 a tiny bit ahead of its smaller siblings). That means the decision really hedges on Samsung’s signature S Pen stylus and the company’s first-ever dual camera module.Now I’ll be the first person to say that after years of improvements to mobile operating systems, we’ve gotten to a point where UIs are properly designed for touch-based navigation. Across both iOS and Android, there’s never a time when you’re screaming out for a mouse or something more precise. Which, for me, softens the allure of a stylus. But after over a week using the Note 8, the S Pen is starting to win me over. There’s just so much you can do, whether it’s jotting down notes without even unlocking the phone, or using the new full sentence translation feature to make up for my shoddy Mandarin reading comprehension. But strangely, the best part about the S Pen is the multiple methods it has for goofing off by making your own homegrown gifs.Option one is to whip out the S Pen, hit Smart Select and put a rectangle over any video you can see on the screen. Boom. gif made. Option two, the Live Messages feature, is new for 2017. Live Messages lets you make animated drawings on a background color of your choosing or even on top of pictures you’ve taken. It’s a virtual meme-making machine, and a joyful addition to a phone that’s so often seen in the hands of no-fun allowed corporate execs.  But that’s still only answering half the question of why you should get a Note 8 over the cheaper S8.The other part of the equation are Samsung’s new dual rear cams, which pairs the S8 and S8 Plus’ camera with a second 12-megapixel sensor with doubles the focal length. It’s a camera set up we’ve already seen in last year’s iPhone 7 Plus. The little special sauce Samsung adds to the mix is the presence of optical image stabilization on both cameras. This is a welcome improvement, because as things get farther away, camera shake tends to becomes a much bigger nuisance. Unfortunately, even with this new addition, the Note 8’s camera performance isn’t flawless.The first issue is that like on the iPhone 7 Plus, you don’t actually have full control over which lens you’re using. Sometimes in low-light environments, hitting the 2x button to zoom results in digital enhancement instead of optical. That means you are just cropping in and getting a lower resolution final image, instead of using the lens with double the focal length. At least it’s not a problem unique to the Note 8. Sometimes when the Note 8 opted for digital zoom instead of optical, the iPhone didn’t. While other times, the situation was reversed. And the really frustrating part is that neither phone offers an override for when you might know better than the silicon nanny holding your hand. Yet even in ideal conditions, the Note 8 didn’t always nail it. Take, for example, photos I got when I tried to snap a picture of New York’s favorite large adult son at a recent Yankee’s game. At first I was absolutely thrilled that the Note 8’s zoom let me get up close and personal like not many phone cameras can. But when looking at pics side-by-side  from the Note 8 and the iPhone 7 Plus, things were close, but the iPhone’s pic was  sharper and less blown out.But when you put a little effort in, the Note 8 can still absolutely dazzle. I was blown away by a shot I took of the nighttime New York skyline with Samsung’s new camera module. I’ve taken this exact shot with a budget DSLR and not gotten something this good. Not only did it let me get everything out of that zoom lens, its photo is sharper, less noisy, and way more colorful than the best I could get from the iPhone 7 Plus.On top of all that, Samsung has a new live focus mode that lets you adjust depth of field similar to how you might on a big DSLR or mirrorless camera. That lets you choose between backgrounds with the creamy blurriness  portrait shooters love, or sharpness all the way from front to back depending on what you’re going for. And you still get the super saturated colors and razor sharp focus that Samsung’s cameras have become known for.Camera and stylus aside, there are a few other little Samsung surprises like the new app pair feature, which lets you create  combos that launch two apps in multi-window mode with a single touch—perfect for anyone who’s ever wanted to find an address from an email or text while keeping an eye on the map. And despite a battery that’s actually smaller in capacity than the one in the S8 Plus (3,300 mAh versus 3,500 mAh), the Note 8’s time of 10 hours and 21 minutes on our rundown test was only  20 minutes shorter than the S8 Plus’s 10:44. With stuff like this, the Galaxy Note 8 is starting to make a pretty good case, but I’m still not sure.The Galaxy Note 8 is supposed to be a phone of excess. It’s supposed to have all the most outrageous tech while simultaneously pushing boundaries that other companies wouldn’t dream about touching. Yet its screen is only marginally bigger than the S8 Plus’ and it doesn’t look that much different either. And even though I like many of the S Pen’s new features like Live Messages and full sentence translation, they really aren’t much more than a collection of handy software tricks. Samsung’s new dual camera module  isn’t even a clear-cut winner against last year’s iPhone 7 Plus, not to mention whatever new handsets Apple is planning on announcing next week. So despite sporting best-in-class components from its screen to its stylus, Samsung’s phablet still seems a bit tame. The only thing about the Note 8 that’s really excessive these days is its price.Now, I’m not saying people shouldn’t get one, that would be ridiculous! I just mean that you really need to find a deal if you want to feel like you’re getting your money’s worth. Carriers are already hocking buy one get one promos that would make getting two Note 8’s feel like stealing. Samsung is even offering its own pre-order bonuses with your choice of either a Gear 360 or a 128GB microSD card and a wireless charger. But shelling out a full $930 or more is foolish. The Note 8 is a great device (especially that screen) and I think Samsung has rightfully regained its spot back on top of the Android dogpile. But for a phone that this expensive, I still want more.Android Nougat 7.1.1 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor • 6GB of RAM •64GB of storage • microSD card slot • 6.3-inch 2960 x 1440 super AMOLED display • headphone jack • USB-C • wireless charging • fingerprint sensor • iris sensor  • face scanner • f/1.7 12-MP main rear camera with OIS • f/2.4 12-MP secondary camera with 2x zoom and OIS • 8-MP front camera • 3,300 mAh battery."
92,Essential Phone,https://gizmodo.com/the-essential-phone-is-too-expensive-to-have-a-camera-t-1798408448,"In August 2017, Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, and his disciples at Essential Products descended onto this mortal plane to grace us with the PH-1—a device that seeks to right the wrongs of modern smartphone design. Almost monolithic in appearance, the PH-1, or the Essential Phone as it’s more commonly known, is forged from a combination of titanium and ceramic meant to withstand the rigors of daily living without needing to be shrouded in ugly plastic cases. OK, let’s get real, there’s a lot of hype behind the phone, but is all that hot air really warranted? Ummm, no.But it is pretty striking! Just look at the way the PH-1’s LCD screen curves around the front-facing camera. It’s the essence of form following function and its impressive 85 percent screen-to-body ratio tops even that of the Galaxy S8. The PH-1’s good looks are pretty subtle though.  “I messed around with the Essential Phone for three minutes and I wasn’t that impressed,” said Gizmodo editor-in-chief Kelly Bourdet. “But then I picked my iPhone 7 back up and thought, ‘What is this piece of shit?’” Yet looks can only take you so far.The problem with simplicity is that unless you absolutely nail the execution, the end result can feel lackluster. The display is a good example. I appreciate that the PH-1’s LCD screen is exceedingly bright with a peak output of around 700 nits, that’s brighter than even the best AMOLED-equipped phones, including the Galaxy S8—which tend to top out at around 550 nits. But the Essential Phone’s display isn’t quite as colorful, and its black levels aren’t that great either. Anytime you watch  videos in a dark room, you’re going to have to put up with annoying dark gray borders because the display can’t get as black as the bezels. On top of that, outside of the PH-1’s home screen, the phone doesn’t always take advantage of its extra widescreen 19:10 aspect ratio, which leaves more awkward, unbalanced black bars around any video you watch. And unlike other phones with exaggerated displays like the LG G6 and Galaxy S8, the Essential Phone won’t automatically adjust content to fit or let you force videos to fill up the screen.The phone is missing a lot of pieces in service of minimalism: There’s no headphone jack, microSD card slot, wireless charging, or water-resistance. Without these features, the phone is more frustrating to use on a daily basis, not less. For all of Rubin’s talk about improving smartphone design, the PH-1 doesn’t really deliver, and its single bottom-mounted speaker sounds pretty mediocre too. I do want to give Rubin and Co. props for stepping up the materials game with titanium and ceramic. However, nothing is invincible and even minor drops will still leave marks.One thing I’m happy to report though, is that the Essential Phone has pretty solid battery life. Initially, I was a little worried that the PH-1’s 3040 mAh battery was too small to keep its 5.7-inch screen up and running for that long. But my concerns were unfounded. Its standby power efficiency is excellent, as it routinely lost just 2 or 3 percent battery charge overnight. And on our battery  rundown test, the Essential Phone’s time of 9:39 was almost half an hour better than the Galaxy S8’s time of 9:12.And all this is coming from a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip, 4GB of RAM and a 128GB of storage, which is more than enough to deliver a swift and responsive smartphone experience. You also get a delicious bloat-free version of stock Android 7.1, as one would expect from the original creator of Google’s ubiquitous mobile OS. Furthermore, the company says upgrades to Android 8 Oreo are due out soon, which if true, will be more than most Android phone makers can say.There’s one place, however, where Essential really drops the ball and it’s infuriating: the camera. I’m beginning to lose track of how many camera updates Essential has sent out over the last week. Out of the box, the PH-1 didn’t even have the ability to take HDR photo, which was later remedied by Essential’s first over-the-air hotfix. But now, three or four updates later, taking pictures with the PH-1 is still agonizing.Image quality is generally fine in bright light, though pics from the Essential Phone still show a lack of sharpness and dynamic range when viewed side-by-side next to shots from the Galaxy S8. And at night, the PH-1 is terribly inconsistent, often capturing a series of dark, blurry and unusable messes. Even on the rare occasions where everything goes right, photos from the PH-1 are still  behind what you get from everything else in this price range.This is especially annoying as the PH-1 has two 13-megapixel cameras versus the S8’s lone 12-MP shooter. And its not like you are getting an optical zoom lens or fancy depth of field effects as with dual cam phones like the iPhone 7 Plus or Huawei P10. In fact, there’s barely any customizable settings at all. Aside from the mode dial that lets you choose between auto, monochrome and slow-mo modes and the row of icons on top for toggling things like HDR and flash, the only other settings you can change are for toggling the shutter sound and location recording on or off. There’s no manual settings to adjust, filters or extra shooting modes that every other flagship phone offers. And if you like shooting in HDR, every time you open up the camera app, you have to enable it again, because your settings don’t get saved. And changing pretty much any setting takes a few seconds, so don’t even think about launching the camera and taking pics with any sort of haste. But the absolute last straw is the Essential Phone’s painful shooting speeds. You tap once to shoot, get nothing, tap a second time, realize you still haven’t taken a shot, tap again to no end, check out the spinning circle in the bottom right wasting your time, try again just in case, and then several seconds later you can hit the shutter button one last time in case you’re really feeling lucky. There were even a few times where a warning message popped up saying “Failed to take photo. Please try again.”  All I want is to take two pics back to back! And simple as that seems, it’s just not reliable. Taking photos with the PH-1 is some of the least confident photography I’ve experienced, which is crazy, because a good camera is one of the most important features on a phone.When reached for comment about the camera performance issues, an Essential Products spokesperson said, “There is another OTA coming soon that should address reports of camera laggyness and image quality.” If there are dramatic changes, we’ll update this review.The PH-1 was never going to be the revolutionary product Essential Products promised. But it could have been a stylish new flavor to help balance out the two-note duopoly that we get from Apple and Samsung. I can only hope that Essential continues to iterate on its camera software and fix the PH-1’s broken photography. Otherwise, the Essential Phone might just end up as a case where  beauty isn’t much more than skin deep. Android 7.1 • 5.7-inch 1440p LCD display • Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor • 4GB of RAM • 128GB storage • rear fingerprint reader • dual 13-MP rear cameras • 8-MP front camera • 1 x USB-C port • 3040 mAh battery  Update 8/30/17 9:23pm ET: After requiring Essential phone customers to provide their drivers’ licenses over email to verify their shipping addresses—and then accidentally sharing that information with other customers—Rubin has issued an apology and explanation of why the company issued an invasive request for private data,  the Verge reported.“Yesterday, we made an error in our customer care function that resulted in personal information from approximately 70 customers being shared with a small group of other customers,” Rubin wrote. “We have disabled the misconfigured account and have taken steps internally to add safeguards against this happening again in the future. We sincerely apologize for our error and will be offering the impacted customers one year of LifeLock.”"
93,Moto Z2,https://gizmodo.com/moto-z2-force-review-motorola-s-new-phone-makes-a-grea-1797444201,"Every once and while you run across a gadget that would be perfect if only it wasn’t missing one tiny feature. That sucks, and often there’s nothing you can do about it because there’s no way for multi-billion dollar companies to anticipate your need for a cattle prod or tiny projector that attaches to your phone. But what if there was? What if you could just switch out modules on a phone with a snap and always have the perfect device for the perfect occasion. That’s supposed to be the new Moto Z2 Force’s promise.A year after releasing its first modular phone, Motorola is now the only company keeping the idea of interchangeable add-ons alive (with the exception of the bizarre new RED Phone), and it’s the only thing going for a phone that’s otherwise simply solid and inoffensive. The problem is most mods aren’t actually that useful. Even with upwards of 20 different mods to choose from, there’s only two or three mods you actually want to buy — which makes the whole proposition of add-ons feel pretty pointless. Particularly when you consider the price. Depending on what carrier you’re on, the Z2 Force will run you somewhere between $720 and $810. That’s the same, if not more than a Galaxy S8 or iPhone 7, which is a pretty big ask for a phone that just delivers mods instead of the same level of features.Particularly as those mods are all pretty pricey. If you want to add wireless charging, better speakers and a bigger battery to the Z2 Force, you’re looking at two to three mods totaling around $200. Then let’s say you toss in a $20 Style Shell to spice up its aesthetics and suddenly you’re juggling a handful of mods, slamming them on and off like a thousand hand slap from E. Honda in Street Fighter II. And they’re not even that cool!The cooler mods, like the Moto 360 Camera or the Moto Gamepad, work as advertised, but are more expensive and feel more limited than a traditional standalone accessory. Moto Mods are really just a big family of add-ons that don’t play nice with other devices. Sure, it’s nice to be able to bang something on the back and instantly have a new gimmick to play with, but is Bluetooth really that hard to use?The price of mods also makes the biggest thorn in the $750 Z2 Force’s side its more affordable sibling, the Moto Z2 Play. The $408 Z2 Play doesn’t have dual rear cameras, or a fancy 1440p AMOLED screen or a snappy Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, but you still get full support for the Moto Z2 Force’s most appealing features: namely mods and the gesture-enabled fingerprint reader. You’ll also get an actual headphone jack. That’s twice the value for half the price!Though it’s not nearly as slim as the Z2 Force. The Z2 Force’s skinny dimensions pose a problem when it comes to battery life. That because Motorola is sticking with a single model instead of two models as with the original Z—one with a super thin design and one with a thick waist and a bigger battery. Motorola chose thinness over battery capacity. At 2,750 mAh, the Z2 Force’s battery is 10 to 20 percent smaller than batteries in competing phones such as the 3,000 mAh battery in the Galaxy S8 or the 3,300 power pack in the OnePlus 5.Besides a sliced down battery the Z2 Force also axed the headphone jack. Moto does include a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter dongle in the box, but that’ll be a sad consolation to anyone who simply wants to recharge their phone while privately listening to music (and with all those mods you might buy it’s also one more thing to carry around). You don’t get any sort of legitimate waterproofing either. Motorola claims the Z2 Force should be able to survive a spill or two, but drop it in a sink, and it’ll be time to say hello to a new phone. And if you want wireless charging, you’ll need to shell out $40 for a special Moto Style Shell or $115 for the Incipio offGrid PowerPack, which includes on a 2,200 mAh battery pack in addition to both Qi and PMA inductive charging.That’s crucial as the similarly prices Samsung S8 has wireless charging built in. It’s also more attractive. Looks wise, the Z2 Force is more Ford Fusion than Ford GT. It’s not what you’d call ugly, but it’s nowhere near the curvy, precision-crafted feel of the S8. There are rough edges where the display meets the phone’s metal frame, an ungainly chin on bottom for the fingerprint sensor and the love-it-or-hate-it appearance of the exposed Moto Mod connector around back.There’s also a rough feeling film across the front of the display. The Z2 Force’s one concession to everyday usability is this “ShatterShield” screen, which, according to Motorola,  was designed to withstand the kind of drops and shocks that would otherwise scatter spiderwebs across the front of your phone. This film, over a plastic display panel (instead of glass panels found in other phones at this price range) makes the Z2 Force’s screen susceptible to being scuffed by your keys or other soft metals. And unlike previous Shattershield screen phones, you can’t even replace the protective film at a local carrier or Best Buy. So if you’re really that worried about keeping your phone pristine and intact, you’re still going to have to swaddle that shit in a case.Putting a case on the Z2 Force almost feels like it’s defeating the purpose of the mods, but at least you’ll get to still use the Z2 Force’s other big feature: Two new 12-megapixel rear cameras. Like the iPhone 7 Plus and the Huawei Mate 9 and P10, the Z2 Force’s dual rear cams enhance portrait photos through shallow depth of field so you can put sharp focus on faces  while potentially distracting elements remain out of focus and blend into the background. The one difference between the Z2 Force and the iPhone 7 Plus is that you don’t get a 2x optical zoom. The problem with the Z2 Force’s neat camera tricks, is that it doesn’t always work quite right. Sometimes, when using the Z2 Force’s depth mode, the soft blur on details in the background crept into the middle of the frame.Thankfully, when it comes to standard photography, the Z2 Force delivers great image quality.  Though, if I can nitpick (and I will), I did notice that in low light, the Z2 Force’s colors weren’t as accurate as what I saw in pics from the Galaxy S8. I also found that that the Z2 Force’s dynamic range, which is the difference between the brightest spot on the picture and the darkest wasn’t quite as good a S8's, which caused some areas to look blown out.And those little flaws hurt this phone badly when comparing it to other flagships. It might have the specs and a decent camera, but when you put everything together, this phone still feels far behind phones like the iPhone 7, the Samsung S8. The mods can’t save it either. With the wealth of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected accessories available today, the argument for modularity is more tenuous than ever before, and without that advantage, there isn’t really anything the Z2 Force can do better than its competition. If you need mods grab the Moto Z2 Play. Otherwise there are bigger and nicer phones you can spend your $800 on.UPDATE: Based on information from Motorola, a previous version of the review mentioned that the ShatterShield screen’s protective film could be replaced. However, a spokesperson from Motorola has informed us that due to the small number of owners who took advantage of this service on previous phones, the option to replace the protective film has been discontinued.

94,Oneplus 5,https://gizmodo.com/the-oneplus-5-is-the-new-android-iphone-ripoff-in-a-ver-1796239952,"The OnePlus employees seemed a little annoyed when I asked how they felt about people comparing its new device to an iPhone. Sure, both phones feature dual camera designs. Yes, the OnePlus 5 has curves that look a lot like an Apple product. Ugh, fine, it’s a really good phone, too. What’s the big deal?Here at Gizmodo, we’re longtime OnePlus fans. From the time the little startup released the impressively excellent and cheap OnePlus 1 back in 2014, we’ve been consistently impressed with the company’s ability to compete with hardware from Apple and Samsung, and to do so with only a staff of a few hundred people. There have been bumps along the road, like hardware shortages and an embarrassing misstep with a USB-C cable that damaged non-OnePlus devices. But still, there’s a good reason we called the OnePlus 3 “the best cheap phone you can buy.” The OnePlus 5 is the company’s slightly more expensive follow up, and the phone holds up to the OnePlus promise to be a “flagship killer.” (Fun fact: there is no OnePlus 4, because the number 4 is bad luck in China.)I honestly think the OnePlus guys were faking their annoyance, when they brushed off my iPhone remark. Shouldn’t a tiny company like OnePlus being favorably compared to Apple, the world’s richest company, be a bit of a coup? Companies have tried to be iPhone inspired before, perhaps most notably in 2015 when HTC released an iPhone clone that simply didn’t work that well. However, the OnePlus 5 might even work better than an iPhone. It’s also proof that the OnePlus business model is winning. The Shenzen-based manufacturer only makes one thing: Android flagship phones. It sells these unlocked phones on the internet for around $500, a couple hundred bucks cheaper than the newest devices from competitors like Apple and Samsung. And with the latest model, announced today, OnePlus can confidently say that its device rivals those competitors in every way.The OnePlus 5 is slim, light, and fast. The phone’s octo-core Snapdragon 835 processor is the same one featured in the new Samsung Galaxy S8, and the dual camera design features both a 16-megapixel Sony sensor and a 20-megapixel Sony telephoto camera that enables a bokeh-tastic portrait mode. The iPhone 7 Plus offers 12-megapixels for its portrait mode which also uses two lenses and some software tricks to add the illusion of depth of field. (OnePlus claims its new setup is “the highest resolution dual camera system available on any smartphone.”) You also get up to 8-gigabytes of RAM and 128-gigabytes of storage with a OnePlus 5. The display is gorgeous. The ceramic fingerprint sensor on the front is terrifically fast. The 3,300 mAh battery can drink up a day’s charge in 30 minutes. It’s a really nice phone!It’s also an Android phone, which is probably a deal-breaker for Apple aficionados. If you’re okay with straying away from the Cupertino crowd, though, you’re going to have a blast with what OnePlus has done to Android. Unlike the heavy-handed skins from original hardware manufacturers (OEMs) like Samsung or HTC, the so-called OxygenOS that comes on the OnePlus 5 actually looks a lot like stock Android, and the company promises that it’s delightfully free of bloatware. OnePlus just added a few features that are popular on other Android phones. There’s even a reading mode that’s supposed to make the phone screen look like a black-and-white Kindle—although the feature is more of a black-and-tan effect. There’s a screenshot mode that will capture an entire page, so you don’t have to scroll down and take multiple screenshots. There’s a night mode that automatically adjusts the display’s colors when the sun goes down. There’s even something called “Secure Box” that lets you store sensitive files behind a pin code or fingerprint.Fun features are one thing, but none of that matters if the phone doesn’t perform. Here’s the thing: the OnePlus 5 performs. For day-to-day operations like sending texts, surfing the web, or checking email, the device is tremendously fast. More processor-heavy tasks like playing games take time, but the performance isn’t any worse than any other flagship. SimCity, for instance, loaded at nearly the exact same speed on the OnePlus 5 as it did on an iPhone 7. The new OnePlus fingerprint reader, however, is noticeably faster than an iPhone’s. Almost too fast.Now about that dual-lens camera. It is, indeed, pretty slick. It also seems like OnePlus realizes that all flagship phones are basically good and fast enough. The camera is one area that can help a smartphone differentiate itself from all the other black slabs of glass out there. So the company didn’t just build a facsimile of the dual camera setup on the iPhone 7 Plus. It actually built a better one with beefier sensors and slicker software. In fact, one of my favorite new things on the OnePlus camera isn’t the “Portrait Mode” that gives you a DSLR-style depth effect. It’s actually a new “Pro Mode” that features a histogram, a level, and full control over other settings like ISO, white balance, and shutter speed without downloading an extra app. All that said, the regular camera mode works great, too.Yet there’s a downside to any OnePlus phone. It is unavoidable. There’s only one. If you don’t like the size, too bad. Every OnePlus iteration is a take it or leave it proposition, since OnePlus only offers a single design. (The OnePlus 5 does come in two colors and configurations, but the design is otherwise the same.) Me, I think the OnePlus 5 and it’s 5.5-inch display is too big, although it does look gorgeous. My favorite phone is the 4.7-inch iPhone, so there’s that bias. However, the OnePlus 5 is noticeably wider than a Samsung Galaxy S8+, and even if you have long thumbs, you’ll struggle to hit the upper lefthand corner of the screen without moving your hand or using the other one. For what it’s worth, though, the OnePlus 5 is slightly thinner than the S8+ as well as the iPhone.The other bummer about OnePlus is you can only buy the devices online. That means, if you want to hold the phone in your hand, you’re almost certainly going to have to buy one. OnePlus is doing some pop-up shops in the United States for the first time, so if you live near a big city, you might be able to check one out before buying. There’s a shop in New York City opening today, in fact. But if you live in rural Tennessee, where I grew up, that won’t be much of a help.The OnePlus 5 is inevitably a tradeoff. You can buy the phone online and hope you like it. Every model is unlocked, features a dual SIM, and works anywhere in the world thanks to support for 34 GSM network bands. The 64-gigabyte model costs $480, and the 128-gigabyte model costs $540. Once again, that’s hundreds of dollars less than a Galaxy S8 or an iPhone 7 Plus. Sure, you can’t go to a shiny white store and play with the device before you buy it, but that privilege isn’t really worth the extra money anyways. So if you want an extremely capable phone with one of the best cameras on the market, give the OnePlus 5 a try. If you’ve been thinking about ditching your iOS device but want a phone that feels familiar, the OnePlus 5 is a great choice. If you like saving money and owning nice things, heck, buy the OnePlus 5. If you hate it, you can always send it back."
95,Blackberry KeyOne,https://gizmodo.com/um-kim-kardashian-i-think-i-found-your-new-blackberry-1794903770,"Pardon me dear readers. Normally this space is reserved for missives to you, but I am positive you do not care about the BlackBerry KeyOne, a new phone from BlackBerry Mobile. Besides Kim Kardashian, very few people have cared about BlackBerry phones in recent years. That’s why today I’m going to take a moment to reach out to Kim. The girl’s been a wreck since her ancient Bold 9900 died last year, and I really think she needs to know there’s a new, actually kind of excellent, BlackBerry device.Dear Kim, light of my existence, harborer of my heart, and port in the storm of life:I know how upset you were last year when your ancient Bold 9900 finally died. Our mutual friend Chrissy Teigen sent you condolence flowers. You were one of, like, twelve people still loyal to BlackBerry. Which the company acknowledged by sending you a BlackBerry Priv. But the BlackBerry Priv is a garbage phone. We wouldn’t wish it on our worst enemy. (Besides, you have other ways of publicly humiliating your nemeses.) But rejoice, dearest Kim, because the new BlackBerry KeyOne is not a garbage phone. In fact, for the very small number of people like you, it’s a solid device.I know girl. I was shocked as hell too.The last few months have been rough for you, what with the robbery and Kanye being Kanye—not to mention Kendall’s unfortunate involvement with that bad Pepsi ad and the Fyre Festival. (Honestly, the last six months have been rough for all of us.) But in spite of everything that may be going on in the world—or in your world—this phone is good news! Even if it’s kind of a weird BlackBerry. It’s not produced by BlackBerry (formerly known as RIM), but by BlackBerry Mobile, a new brand licensed to Chinese TV maker TCL. The KeyOne is the Blackberry brand’s latest attempt to stay relevant in a world of Apple iPhones and Samsung Galaxies. It runs on Android (Android 7.1 Nougat, to be exact), which means that unlike your old Bold, you can use the Kimoji keyboard app and play your game. But it’s still a BlackBerry, so there’s a keyboard, and unlike the Priv, which had a mushy slide-out keyboard, the KeyOne’s keyboard is built into the device, solid as hell, and kind of perfect if a person is like you, Kim, and misses having a nice physical keyboard.The keyboard on the KeyOne even has a few tricks. There’s a fingerprint sensor built right into the space bar. That’s totally better than the trend of putting it on the back of the phone, and the sensor allows you to approve Google Play purchases with a touch, so North won’t be able to make those accidental in-app purchases that Kanye hates so much. The best part of the keyboard might be that you can assign shortcuts to each individual key. I set the “I” key to launch Instagram. This was great, except for when I was in the text app. The keys do not launch apps or function as speed dial buttons when in text apps. But the keyboard does function as a trackpad in a pinch. This made it much easier for me to scroll through photos from the Met Gala.But girl, there is a trade-off when your BlackBerry has a great keyboard. It means the screen is small compared to the screen on everyone else’s fancy flagship phone. Scrolling on the keyboard is just easier than scrolling using the display. If you’ve been jealous of the Samsung Galaxy S8's 5.5 inch display or even the Apple iPhone 7's 4.8 inch display, then the KeyOne’s 4.5 inch screen is a bummer. But thanks to the phone’s design the display also has a very square 3:2 aspect ratio. That’s awful for watching movies, but practically perfect for making sure a photo will be fire on Instagram.  And that’s very easy because BlackBerry gets you girl, and while it couldn’t afford to put a professional photographer into every single phone, it did put a 12 megapixel camera on the back. The camera, which uses the same sensor as the Google Pixel, takes great photos, which rival shots taken on a Samsung or Apple phone. The front camera is a lower-resolution 8 megapixel affair. But don’t worry Kim my darling, it can still handle your daily selfies.Yet let’s be real about something Kim, the KeyOne is not gonna win any fashion awards. The phone is thicker and heavier than an iPhone 7 or Galaxy S8. It feels solid and durable in a way those phones do not, but don’t throw this at Khloe’s head. That would be considered assault with a deadly weapon. Besides the battery life is too nice for you to just be using the phone as a BlackBerry-shaped bludgeoning device. I easily got through two full days of regular use without reaching for the USB-C charger, and because it uses Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0, the phone juices up super fast. If BlackBerry Mobile starts hounding you about this phone, Kim, its PR reps will probably talk up the included BlackBerry Hub and the DTEK security apps. Even though you of all people could probably benefit from a more secure phone, I don’t think you’ll care that much about these features. The BlackBerry Hub is just a giant inbox for all of your messaging accounts (Instagram, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter), and although that sounds nice in theory, it can be overwhelming if you get a lot of notifications. My advice is to not even bother with that stuff and just enjoy the Android experience.Most people are still going to make fun of you for rocking a brand that hasn’t been relevant since George Bush was in office. That’s okay, Kim! BlackBerry has been so lame the last few years that I get it if you’re a little reticent to carry around its latest hefty brick. But this phone, with its capacitive physical keyboard was designed for you (and BlackBerry’s other primary demographic, aging lawyers who still use WordPerfect). The $550 BlackBerry KeyOne is an attempt at making a phone the rest of us would want to use, and it’s so solidly built, with a great camera, and excellent battery life, that I’m almost wooed myself. This is the closest to a winner that BlackBerry’s built in years. Love,Christina"
96,Samsung Galaxy S8,https://gizmodo.com/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-the-prettiest-phone-wins-1794526975,"With the exploding Note 7 battery fiasco, Samsung inadvertently did something that’s increasingly difficult these days:  It made smartphones interesting for a flickering moment. Super interesting in fact. Besides the intriguing mournful saga of the Note 7, whose embarrassing recall cost the company billions, Samsung also set up a dramatic release narrative for  the Galaxy S8. This wasn’t just another smartphone—this was a make-or-break device charged with saving a company in the throes of an existential crisis. A smartphone that screams at the void—yikes!With the stakes high, Samsung has delivered a device that legitimately stands out from the rest. The Galaxy S8 is a good enough phone that Samsung can likely leave that Note 7 drama behind. (Though, you know, we’re still waiting to see what unfortunate cataclysm will befall the S8 now.) Ultimately, what makes the S8 a winner isn’t any of the assistant smart features that manufacturers have been pushing hard over the last few years—in fact Samsung’s entrant here, Bixby, falls short. The S8 wins with an industry-leading hardware design that challenges the iPhone’s aesthetic supremacy.If you buy the Galaxy S8, you’re buying it because it’s the most beautiful phone available. While it falls short of being completely bezel-less, it might as well be. Though LG released a similarly bezel-less device earlier this year, it suffered from an excess of simplicity. Samsung is way ahead of most competitors you would realistically consider, like the Google Pixel, and the iPhone 7, which are both encased in unsightly prisons of bezel.The design is a huge leap forward for Samsung, which has been inching in this direction for years with its edge display devices. This thing is practically all display on the front, and Samsung even got rid of its physical home button. The phone’s gently rounded edges and curves create the effect of a display that’s simply floating in the air or hovering just above your hand. There are no jarring interruptions to the minimal design. It feels like you’re looking at a phone from the future, rather than a tired rehash of a winning design from the past—unsurprisingly, Apple is reportedly considering a similar look for its forthcoming iPhone.The S8 comes in two display sizes—a 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 ($750), and the 6.2-inch S8+ ($850). I tested the S8+, but the only difference between the two devices is size and price. Those display sizes make it difficult to compare them to other devices. Both S8s have an 18.5:9 aspect ratio, as opposed the more traditional 16:9 shape. Consequently the S8+ is a little thicker and taller than the iPhone 7 Plus, as well as very slightly narrower. Nitpicking aside, they’re basically the same size:There’s been some debate about the merits of the new 18.5:9 aspect ratio (LG, again, did something similar this year, too). Most of the content you will view on websites, Netflix, Hulu, and so on is 16:9  so it fills up the entirety of devices like the iPhone. Meanwhile, watch the same content on the S8, and the picture will be surrounded by black bars. It feels wasteful, but, as you see in the image above, it isn’t the end of the world.Compared to the other phones you might consider buying these days, the S8's OLED is noticeably brighter and more vivid. Your photos will pop on this display.Besides the hardware design, the other fresh addition in the S8 is Bixby, Samsung’s newly acquired digital assistant tech that’s meant to compete with Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, and Amazon’s Alexa. At launch, Bixby will not support voice commands, though Samsung promises that feature will land this spring. I promised myself I wasn’t going to nail Samsung for shipping unfinished product (despite what happened the last time Samsung did). In the end I don’t need to. Most voice assistants are dumb as hell, including Google Assistant, which is also built into the S8, but Bixby’s bad enough that adding voice support wouldn’t even make a difference. Many of Bixby’s features seem amazing at first glance. Like the hardware button Samsung has built onto the side of the phone. It wakes Bixby up with a touch instead of a shout. There is nothing I hate more than invoking assistants by name. OK Google—tell me I sound like an asshole! Push the button, and Bixby’s Google Now-like dashboard display pops up, showing your appointments, the weather, and information from supported apps like Samsung Health and CNN.In practice, the additional hardware button just causes confusion. I frequently hit it instead of the volume down button, pulling up the assistant instead of taking a photo or reducing the loudness of my music. Worse, one morning when the S8's alarm clock woke me up ungodly early, I dumbly fumbled around for my phone and instead of waking the phone up to turn off my alarms, I pressed the Bixby button was presented with all the meetings I had planned for the day, as if Bixby’s sole purpose was to remind me that my every waking hour will be toil and suffering.The assistant’s potentially most impressive feature is Bixby Vision, which allows you to use the phone’s camera to search by image. This kind of technology has existed from years—Amazon introduced an impressive feature called Flow three years ago. So it’s incredible how bad this feature is.When you tap the little Bixby Vision button in the S8's camera app, the tool takes a moment to process what you’re looking at, and then presents you with the option to use the image to do a general search, a shopping search, or in the event that it identifies wine or text, to treat the visual information accordingly.The only Bixby Vision tool that works with any level of consistency is the shopping tool, which identified a Monster energy drink (SUGAR FREE!) and a Neil deGrasse Tyson book correctly. When I pointed it at very expensive over-ear headphones headphones, it tried to sell me moderately priced earbuds, which fair enough, I don’t need to spend $900 on headphones.The more general image search capability is a joke, and feels like a failure. The only image it was able to identify correctly is an old photograph by German documentary photographer August Sander. Sure, this is just a Pinterest search, but I’m having trouble figuring out what the hell the point of this is.As for the wine and text tools—they need serious work. The only time Bixby identified a wine bottle, I wasn’t pointing it at wine. The text tool has a hard job, and tends to interpret everything but the cleanest Helvetica typography as a garbled mess.Beyond the frustrating assistant, Samsung’s software is actually really nicely refined. TouchWiz, the company’s proprietary spin on Android, is no longer the unattractive horrorshow it was for years—mostly because Samsung has increasingly stayed out of Google’s way.  Some of Samsung’s software additions are quite useful, like the Apps Edge drawer, which slides out a customizable collection of your favorite apps with a swipe from the right edge of the display.Samsung’s camera is good enough for your snaps and ‘grams. There’s no dual camera like you’re finding on some other devices, but at least it comes with some built-in Snapchat Lens-like filters—Cool?Less cool is Samsung moving the fingerprint scanner to the back of the phone to the side of the camera was a mistake. It’s not placement on the back so much, which was likely necessary to make that beautiful bezel-less front. It’s that the sensor is off center so it lacks the intuitive feel of fingerprint sensors that are smack in the middle, as in the case of the Google Pixel and LG G6. What’s more, Samsung has gone and put the freaking camera exactly where your brain wants the sensor to be. Instagram your fried chicken dinner at your own risk. In the end, the Galaxy S8 handily smokes the Android competition as the top phone you can buy. It’s prettier and slicker than the Pixel, and though Bixby feels a little unfinished for the moment, you can still use Google Assistant. The S8 also measures up favorably with the iPhone 7, and whether you choose one or the other probably comes down to something as simple as whether you want Samsung’s forward-thinking ideas or Apple’s refined simplicity. Or maybe you want a headphone jack—the S8 has one!As for whether you should upgrade, well, that’s another question entirely. How busted is your current phone? Is it broken and you need a new one? The S8 is a great option. Is your phone less than two years old and humming along fine? Wait until next year. What’s truly interesting about the S8 is just how compelling a phone can be on the merits of its great design alone. Bixby is basically rubbish, and yet the phone is a winner. Perhaps it shouldn’t be all that surprising: Top flagship phones with beefy specs are going to perform very well without fail these days. They all have good cameras and day-long battery life and processors that can chop through huge mobile games. It’s so challenging to make a device stand out that manufacturers are employing all manner of gimmicks, like voice assistants and modular accessories, to see if they can’t make their devices standout. None of those technologies improve your life quite as much as a design that plays into our crudest superficiality; I stare at my phone all goddamn day—I want to look at something pretty."
