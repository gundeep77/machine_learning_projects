0,Google Pixel 6,"Google Pixel 6 review: finally, a premium smartphone from Google","With the Pixel 6, Google has taken a slightly different approach to its previous range of smartphones – instead of the 'cute' and 'quirky' designs of previous Pixel flagships, the Google Pixel 6 is premium through-and-through, with expensive materials and a polished design.This could be seen as the first phone from Google that can truly go up against the likes of Samsung, Apple and Huawei at the very top end of the premium smartphone spectrum, where handsets cost a substantial chunk of money and look every bit as expensive and as packed with power as they are.This comes after last year's Pixel 5, which was almost at the other end of the spectrum, offering middle of the road specs at a discounted price, making it difficult to distinguish the Pixel 5 from the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 4a, all of which were very good phones, but none were competition for Samsung's premium flagship.That has all changed now, though, and in this Google Pixel 6 review, we'll take you through everything you need to know about the phone, from the quality of that famous Pixel camera, to what you can expect from the battery life. That should help you figure out whether or not this is the best phone for you.Here's what you get in the Google Pixel 6 box:The Pixel 6 will be released on the 28th of October 2021 and can be yours for £599 in the UK and $699 in the US – you can buy it directly and SIM-free from the Google Store, as well as from third-party retailers. In the UK, it's also available on a variety of pay monthly contract details from the likes of O2, Vodafone, EE and Three.That's a pretty good price, considering the decidedly less premium Google Pixel 5 was the same price at launch. You're getting a lot more for your money here.It's also significantly cheaper than the Google Pixel 6 Pro, which starts at $899 in the US, £849 in the UK and AU$1,299 in Australia.The Pixel 6 comes sporting a 6.4-inch screen, which is much larger than the displays of previous Pixel phones, which were quite compact in comparison.The AMOLED, HDR10+ screen runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz and a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels – it's fluid, sharp, bright and difficult to find fault with. A single punch hole notch for the selfie camera sits up in the top left-hand corner, while the bezels are nice and thin all the way around the screen.As for the rest of the design, the aluminium metal body of previous Pixel phones has gone – now we get a much more traditional metal frame with glass-back design. Google does keep things slightly playful with a two-tone colourway, available in either black/grey, pink/coral, or mint/green. I like these colour options as they differentiate the Pixel from other more traditionally coloured smartphones.Perhaps the most contentious part of the new design is the large camera bump on the back, which sits a good 3mm proud of the case. It's not the most attractive design, and can also make it awkward to slip the phone into a pocket (the camera bump often gets caught on things). It also makes the phone top-heavy and unbalanced.However, it does stretch the entire width of the phone case, so it doesn't rock when put on a flat surface.It's certainly not a major issue, but it is an odd design choice.The phone is officially IP68-rated, which means it's able to survive being submerged in water at a depth of 1.5 metres (nearly 5 feet) for up to 30 minutes, which gives you some extra peace of mind.There's no headphone jack here, just a USB-C port.Ever since the first Pixel, these phones have shone in terms of photo-taking – not in the raw specs, but in the quality of the image processing that Google is able to apply through its software. That continues with the Pixel 6 and this year, it features Google Tensor, a new custom-built chip that helps speed up image processing.The 50MP+12MP camera setup in operation here is a huge leap forward from the configuration we saw in the Pixel 5, especially in terms of megapixels.The main camera is a 50MP sensor with an f/1.9 aperture. It features omnidirectional phase detection autofocus, laser autofocus, and optical image stabilisatoin.The ultrawide camera features a 12MP sensor, f/2.2 aperture, and 114-degree field of view.Photos are again excellent, with sharpness, colour reproduction, detail and dynamic range all impressing. Cameras on other phones have more lenses and more tricks – and Google's competitors are definitely catching up – but Pixel photography remains the high bar for images that look great and are effortless to take.As with previous models, the Night Sight mode can do wonders for dark photos (if you can keep your phone still for a second or two) – Google claims that the main image sensor captures 150-percent more light than the Pixel 5, bringing vivid colour and greater accuracy to photos. Unless you're trying to shoot in the pitch darkness though, your low light shots will come out with plenty of detail and colour, especially when it comes to close-up photos – it's very impressive – although our only complaint would be that it makes some shots look unnaturally bright.Google has also added a few new tricks in the form of 'Motion Mode' which aims to make everyday shots more epic with action shots and long exposures. Previously this type of photography has been difficult to do on smartphones, so it's exciting to see Google experiment here.Motion mode has two settings; Action Pan, which focuses on the moving subject and adds a creative blur to the background, and Long Exposure, which adds a creative blur to the moving subjects in the scene.Think gushing waterfalls, car headlight trails, and bikes speeding past.Unfortunately, these features weren't added to our review unit quite yet – we'll update this review once we've tried them out. You can read our Pixel 6 Pro review to see them in action.Google's clever software now also features Face Unblur which helps to clearly capture faces even in the toughest conditions, as well as 'Real Tone', and it means portraits taken on the Pixel 6 should reflect all skin tones more accurately.In terms of front cameras, the Pixel 6 has an 8-megapixel sensor with a ƒ/2.0 aperture and an 84-degree wide field of view.The Pixel 6 supports 5G and runs on Google new Tensor processor, which is paired with an ample 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage (with no memory card expansion slot).Google claims Tensor gives up to 80-percent faster performance than Pixel 5, so apps load quicker and gaming is more responsive.The Pixel 6 has achieved an average Geekbench 5 score of 2837 – which is good, but not as good as other flagship phones.From gaming to photo editing to email, we didn't notice any lag or stutter from the Pixel 6 during our time testing it.The Pixel 6 display and stereo speakers work well for watching shows and movies, and although the screen isn't huge, it's perfectly fine as a media player. You get all the Google apps preinstalled of course, plus a couple of useful Pixel exclusives – including a Recorder tool that can transcribe spoken text in real-time for you (useful if you need to record an interview, phone call or lecture, for example).The Pixel 6 offers fast 30W charging and 21W wireless charging – that's fast. You can get up to 50-percent battery in just 30 min.We haven't run any scientific battery tests, but the 4614 mAh battery comfortably lasted all day, every day throughout our review period.But, besides the cameras, the clean software has always been one of the best reasons to buy a Pixel phone, and nothing has changed this time around. You're guaranteed to get Android updates before anyone else for the next couple of years, and there isn't anything in the way of bloatware or unnecessary apps.Android 12 is one of the biggest updates to Android in years, and one of the most prominent changes is how Android looks. Google calls this 'Material UI' and it sees the system adapt the colours to match the colours in your phone background – everything from the icons, to messages, to the calculator app are changed.There are also a number of new and very useful widgets to play around with like the various clock faces and conversation widgets. All of the new design features make the phone quicker and more straightforward to use.Google has aimed high with the Pixel 6 and it's a big improvement over the Pixel 5 – you now get a more premium design, faster CPU, improved camera, and plenty of new software features. Perhaps best of all, it's available for the same price as last year's phone.There's certainly a lot to like about the Pixel 6 and only a few small things to complain about. The main issue is the large camera bump on the back of the phone – it not only looks awkward but it makes for some iffy ergonomics as well. It's also a shame that this device has grown and there's no longer a compact size option from Google.But they're easy things to look past – the reasons you would buy this Pixel phone continue to be the reasons you would buy any Pixel phone: primarily, speedy Android updates for the next few years, a bloat-free software experience with some nice Google-y tweaks, and a camera that's going to outperform most of the others on the market at the moment.One of the best phones for most people is still the iPhone 13, with a 6.1-inch screen, or the iPhone 13 Mini which has an even smaller screen at just 5.4-inches. They've not got the same long and thin design but they're still both pretty compact. The battery life is better than previous iPhones, they look great, have fantastic camera systems, pack in 5G, and the screens are beauties.Not a fan of iOS? Not everyone is, even though sometimes it may seem like they are. If you’re only looking at Android phones then the OnePlus 9 could be a good choice. It's around the same size, with a 6.55-inch screen, housed in a slim and lightweight handset. It’s a very impressive phone all around, and it's around the same price, too.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/google-pixel-6-review
1,Google Pixel 6 Pro,Google Pixel 6 Pro review: a sleek and sophisticated smartphone to rival the flagships,"T3’s official Google Pixel 6 Pro review is here. It was a hotly anticipated handset and right from the get-go, this phone boasts specs and features that will rival some of the best phones on the market.Last year’s Google Pixel 5 arrived on our shores as a one-man band but proved to be a winner thanks to its excellent camera and clean software. So of course, we expected big things from the Google Pixel 6, and this time around Google has treated us to two versions of the phone.The Google Pixel 6 Pro is the pricier, classier sibling to the Pixel 6. Google has taken a whole new direction here, and it has worked brilliantly. It’s sure to be one of the best Android phones this year and will go up against the likes of the Samsung S21 Plus and the OnePlus 9 Pro when it comes to its screen, camera and extra features.What’s more, is that this is the very first phone running Android 12. So this Google Pixel 6 Pro review won't just cover everything you need to know about the phone, but you can find out more about the tech giant’s new operating system as well.Let’s get to it, here’s the full Google Pixel 6 Pro review, starting with the unboxing video.The Google Pixel 6 Pro is a high-end smartphone at a high-end price. You’ll be able to buy it from the 28th October 2021 for $899 in the US, £849 in the UK and AU$1,299 in Australia.That’s significantly more expensive than the Google Pixel 6 which will only set you back $599 / £599 / AU$999.So other than the price tag, how is it different to the Google Pixel 6? While they might look similar, but the Google Pixel 6 Pro is actually a much more advanced piece of kit.Firstly, its 6.7inch QHD+ display is bigger and has a higher resolution, the Pixel 6 has a FHD+ 6.4inch screen instead. Because of that, the Google Pixel 6 Pro is a much larger handset. Under the hood, you’ll also get a bigger battery and more RAM.Perhaps one of the biggest differences between the two is the camera system. They both use the same 50MP wide camera and 12MP ultrawide camera, but the Pro version of the phone packs in a third lens, the 48MP telephoto camera. The Google Pixel 6 Pro also has an 11.1MP front camera, as opposed to the 8MP selfie snapper on the Pixel 6.Sharp, sophisticated and sleek are the three words I would use to describe the Google Pixel 6 Pro. The straight edges and rectangular design paired with the curved display make this phone feel like it’s geared towards a more mature and serious audience, it’s not the playful handset previous generations of the phone once were.Both phones in the Google Pixel 6 series have a unique new camera design on the back that hasn’t been seen before on a smartphone. Instead of the usual square or rounded module tucked into the top left corner, it now stretches across the whole width of the handset. It still sticks out but solves the problem of the phone rocking when you try to use it on a flat surface. If anything it props the phone up at an angle which makes it more comfortable to use. My only problem with the new design is that it did get caught quite a lot sliding it in and out of my pocket.Measuring 163.9 x 75.9 x 8.9 mm, it's worth knowing that this is a very big phone. It was too big for my small hands, but at 210g it’s actually not too heavy. The curved display makes it easier to grip so anyone with hands bigger than mine will have no problems using it. The build quality is just as reliable as you would expect from Google, with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus on both sides and IP68 dust and water resistance so it’ll survive splashes of rain.You can buy the Google Pixel 6 Pro in one of three smart colours: Stormy Black, Cloudy White and Sorta Sunny. I got my hands on the Stormy Black colourway, but it’s more grey than black. The two-tone design is light grey above the camera module and a darker grey below.If I were to nitpick about the new design, I’d have to mention that the sharp edges of the camera module are very prone to getting stubborn dust caught in the grooves. It was quite difficult to clean it out.Around the frame, there isn’t much to say because there isn't much there. There’s a USB-C port on the bottom and the SIM card slot on the left. On the right, there’s the power button followed by the volume rocker. The buttons are placed in that order, which took a bit of getting used to because I’m so used to the power button sitting below the volume controls on literally every other phone.To unlock the phone, there’s an in-display fingerprint sensor. It wasn’t the most reliable and it didn’t always register my fingerprint every time. It was also placed a little too far up the screen so I had to extend my thumb to use it.Stretching across the front of the phone, the edge-to-edge curved 6.7inch OLED screen has a resolution of QHD+ (1440 x 3120). It is stunning. Crisp and detailed with bright, vibrant colours the Google Pixel 6 Pro really gives you a premium experience on the display. Whether you’re editing photos, watching videos or even messaging, it will blow you away with just how beautiful it looks.HDR support means watching TV shows and movies is a pleasure too, boosting the contrast so you can see everything even in the brightest and darkest areas of the screen.All of that together with the 120Hz refresh rate made for incredibly smooth scrolling, swiping and tapping - when you open up a mobile game, you'll really be able to tell the difference but you can even see the benefits just browsing through the menus.Because it uses LTPO technology, the phone will automatically adapt the refresh rate according to what you’re doing. It stays at 60Hz by default and gets increased to 120Hz for some tasks while decreasing it to as low as 10Hz for others. That should help to conserve the battery.The camera system is made up of a 50MP wide camera, a 12MP ultrawide camera and a 48MP telephoto camera, as well as an 11.1MP front camera.Shots came out looking colourful, detailed and bright. When you zoom into the shot, there's loads of intricate detail that I couldn’t see from where I took the photo. I was also really impressed with how well the camera balanced the light and dark areas of the image. Granted, the colours are a little over the top. Despite being highly saturated they don't look too unrealistic. Take a look at the gallery below for some examples of shots taken on the Google Pixel 6 Pro.The camera packs a 4x optical zoom, but you can go even further with the 20x SuperRes digital zoom which is surprisingly usable, producing clear shots with enough detail to see what the human eye can't.While you'd expect to find an ultrawide mode on the rear camera, you don't always get it on the front camera. There is one on the Google Pixel 6 Pro which is great for taking group selfies and making sure everyone fits in the shot.Even at night you'll be able to take decent photos thanks to the Night Sight mode. It does a great job at brightening up shots in low lighting conditions, you can see the difference it makes below.A feature that's more unique to the Google Pixel 6 series is the Motion Mode. It adds a blur to moving objects in a shot to create more professional-looking photos, There's a choice of two settings, you can use either Action Pan or Long Exposure. Take a look at the examples below to see Motion Mode in action.Ever taken a fantastic shot, but then you look at it and a stranger in the background has accidentally photobombed it, ruining the photo? The Magic Eraser tool fixes that, you can use it to remove both people and objects.When I tried it out with one of my old photos (not taken on the Google Pixel 6 Pro) it did a great job at removing all the people from the shot without a trace. For the most part, it’ll automatically pick up the objects you might want to remove. Admittedly it will sometimes miss parts out like the dog on a lead in this photo, in which case you can select them for yourself. This is a really useful feature, especially for those who post a lot on social media.The camera system is incredible and easily matches up to some of the best phones you can buy. What makes it even better is just how many AI-based camera modes and features there are to improve the look of your photos.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 1,029Multi-Core Score: 2,790Powering the phone is the Google Tensor Titan M2 processor, designed purely for Pixel. Alongside that, there’s 12GB of RAM and a choice of either 128GB or 256GB of in-built storage.The Google Pixel 6 Pro is very responsive and everything feels instantaneous whether that’s loading apps or flicking through various open windows at once. Having said that, I wouldn’t necessarily use it for more demanding mobile games like Fortnite because it did heat up and suffer from a small amount of lag.Outside of gaming, you don’t have to wait for anything, even when you’re using the more complex AI-based features on the phone. That's where this handset really thrives.I ran the Geekbench 5 benchmarking test on the Google Pixel 6 Pro and it achieved scores of 1,029 in single-core and 2,790 in multi-core. While that is much faster than the Google Pixel 5, it’s still not as good as other flagship phones. I’d compare those scores to mid-range devices like the OnePlus Nord 2.One area that really impressed me was the battery life, it seemed to last well over a day of using it. I wasn’t on it constantly but I replied to a few messages, scrolled through Instagram, streamed music and did a bit of online shopping without needing to even consider the battery life. That’ll be thanks to the Adaptive Battery which uses AI to learn which apps are your favourite and stops the phone from wasting power on the ones you don’t really use.To test out the battery even more accurately I downloaded and played a couple of Netflix episodes on full brightness and left it running for two hours. In that time, the battery only dropped by about 12% which suggests it would have lasted nearly 17 hours of video playback in total - that’s impressive by any standards.The Google Pixel 6 Pro also supports 30W fast charging, although you won’t get the adaptor included in the box, just the USB-C cable. Fortunately, I already had my own so I could test it out. Using that, it took less than an hour and a half to recharge the phone from empty to 100%.As we have come to expect, the Google Pixel 6 series debuted the newest version of Android - Android 12, and what an OS it is. It’s even more genius than it was before.Firstly, let's talk about how it looks because aesthetically, there have been some significant upgrades. Once you’ve chosen your wallpaper, the system will adapt the colours of the whole user interface to match it, so the icons and apps like the calculator or camera will all match the colours you’ve chosen. It’s a simple change but it's brilliant. You can see what it looks like in the picture below.There are also new widgets to play around with like the various clock faces and conversation widgets. All of the new design features make the phone quicker and more straightforward to use. You can access all of your favourite apps and your notifications in a heartbeat through the home screen.Android 12 and the Google Pixel 6 series both use AI to make your life easier in many different ways. One of the big focus points here is voice control.Of course, there's quick and easy access to Google Assistant. You can ask for the day's news headlines or control your smart home without needing to touch the phone at all, just use the wake words 'Hey Google' or 'Ok Google'.What's great is that you can actually perform some actions without even using the wake words, like if your phone rings you can simply say ‘answer’ or to switch off an alarm say ‘snooze’  - the latter makes oversleeping easier than ever, that’s for sure.Voice typing has been improved for this new generation, it’s not 100% right all of the time but it has gotten very good. To voice type in a written conversation, you just need to say ‘Hey Google, type’ and when you’re done just say ‘send’. You can literally have full conversations over text without tapping the phone screen once.Another major feature to talk about is Live Translate. It’s game-changing technology that will make travelling abroad and communicating with people worldwide a million times easier. You can use it in a few ways.The first is through the messaging app where you can translate incoming messages to your language and send one back in theirs. The second is for when you’re watching videos or reading text on the web, you can get live captions to translate it as you go.Where it gets really good though is on the camera. You just point the camera at the foreign language and it will translate it in front of you, so reading menus or road signs abroad has literally never been easier.Finally, there’s the interpreter mode which can translate each language in a spoken conversation there and then. I tried these features out with a language I know well and it seemed to work quite well each time, even if it's not completely accurate you'll still get the gist. I’m impressed. It’s made me want to jet off on holiday to test it out in a real-world setting.To sum everything up, the Google Pixel 6 Pro is an impressive smartphone that can definitely compete with the flagships, and one of the best things about it is that the brain of the operation is Android 12.While it’s not the fastest smartphone out there, this phone has tonnes of incredible AI-based features like the Adaptive Battery and Interpreter Mode. You'll also get a stunning display, although admittedly it will be far too big for some people.Like you’d expect from a Pixel, the camera is excellent. There are loads of different features and modes to play around with which make this it a great choice for anyone who likes to snap professional-looking photos on a regular basis.So who should buy this phone? The Google Pixel 6 Pro is a serious handset, it doesn’t play around with fun colours or soft curves. Instead, it’s angular and sharp with a heavy focus on quality and delivering outstanding, innovative features. That’s why it’s clearly more suited to more mature adults than younger ones. It'll be a good choice for those who want to feel as sophisticated as the Google Pixel 6 Pro looks.If money is no object then the best Android phone you can buy is still the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra because it is an amazing piece of technology across the board - whether that's the stunning 6.8-inch 120Hz WQHD+ screen, the powerful flagship-grade hardware or the feature-packed camera system. It is a very pricey phone though.For those who prefer iOS, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is the best choice of phone with a big screen because it has a 120Hz Pro Motion display as well as top-tier performance and an incredible camera system. It has a really long-lasting battery life, too.Not interested in having such a big screen? Or not so keen on spending this much? The Samsung Galaxy S21 is the best phone for Android fans while the Apple iPhone 12 is the best iOS phone for most people.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/google-pixel-6-pro-review
2,Sony Xperia 5 III,Sony Xperia 5 III review: a compact smartphone competing against the flagships,"Any Sony Xperia 5 III review has to start off by pointing out that this phone packs flagship-level specs into a very small handset. It’s refreshing to use a phone purely one-handed, and that’s why it was always going to be one of the best Android phones you can buy.Sony sure knows their stuff when it comes to creating some of the best smartphones in the world and they have just as much success selling some of the best compact cameras - so naturally, they combine those talents wherever they can. Their smartphone cameras are known for having detailed functionality and lots of camera modes to try out.The Sony Xperia 5 III is no different, and it pairs that in-depth camera system with high-end hardware under the hood. You don’t lose out just because you wanted a smaller phone.In this Sony Xperia 5 III review, I’ll cover everything you need to know about the phone from its design and display to the cameras and its performance and battery.Available to buy now from Amazon, the Sony Xperia 5 III costs $999 in the US and £899 in the UK, which works out to be around AU$1,300 in Australia.While the design and build of the Sony Xperia 5 IIIi is almost identical to the Sony Xperia 5 II there have been a few upgrades to the phone.The first is in performance, the Sony Xperia 5 III sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, up from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 that was in there before, so it should be more powerful. There’s also a bigger 4,500mAh battery and wireless charging, as well as faster wired charging.The camera has changed as well, what used to be a 12MP telephoto lens with a 70mm focal length is now a 12MP periscope camera with a focal length of 70-105mm. Other than that the camera is the same 12MP ultra-wide lens and 12MP wide-angle lens. The camera also now features the AI super-resolution zoom technology.One other improvement worth mentioning is in the speaker system which is now 40% louder.What makes the Sony Xperia 5 III different to other similarly-priced smartphones is its size. It takes all of the best parts of the Sony Xperia 1 III and packs them into a more compact handset that measures just 157 x 68 x 8.2 mm and weighs only 168g. It’s great because it fits comfortably in your hand and in most pockets.Available to buy in a glossy black or green, you don't compromise on style either. The Sony Xperia III looks smart and in terms of the build quality, you feel like you’re in safe hands here as well. With Corning Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and back it should withstand a few knocks. It also has IP65/686 water resistance and dust protection. One downfall is that the phone is quite slippy to hold but that will easily be solved by putting on a case.The rear cameras are loaded into a long rounded module and it doesn’t protrude too far from the back of the phone. There are a number of buttons to get to grips with including the volume rocker, the power button which doubles up as a fingerprint sensor, the Google Assistant button and the camera shutter button. It would be nice if these were more spread out as they’re all along the right-hand side of the frame which does make things confusing.When you do successfully locate the fingerprint sensor unlocking the phone is very quick, it's much more reliable and easy to use than in-display sensors. Similarly, the camera shutter button made it much easier to snap a shot with precision and control.Now onto the display: you get a 6.1inch 21:9 CinemaWide screen with FHD+ (2520 x 1080) resolution and HDR OLED technology. The tall and narrow display fits perfectly in your hand and when you turn it around it's perfect for watching TV shows and movies. The quality of the screen won't blow you away but it is crisp and clear enough to play Netflix in decent quality.The Sony Xperia III has a refresh rate of 120Hz which means it not only looks good but it feels silky smooth to use as well, whether you’re playing mobile games or flicking through Instagram.There’s also a small LED light in the top right corner of the screen to show when you’ve received a new notification.A triple-lens camera sits on the back of the Sony Xperia 5 III, it’s made up of a 12MP ultrawide camera, a 12MP wide-angle lens and a 12MP periscope lens. On the front, there’s an 8MP selfie snapper.When using the automatic settings, photos came out looking bright and precise with plenty of detail. From the example shots in the gallery below, you can also see that colour accuracy and reproduction is certainly flagship-level. One thing it did seem to struggle with was contrast, there were times where there wasn't a great balance between light and dark areas of the shot.Using the dual periscope lens, the optical zoom goes up to 4.4x. To go even further there’s a 12.5x digital zoom and AI super-resolution zoom to polish up the photo. In use, it does do a good job at sharpening up the image although the result is still too grainy to use for anything like social media.One thing the Sony Xperia 5 III camera does really well is focusing on the subject even at extended focal lengths, and even if they are moving. When it comes to people or animals, it focuses on their eyes and tracks them that way. It's very accurate and effective which makes taking in-focus shots much easier.As you expect from a Sony Xperia smartphone, the Photography Pro camera app has lots of different settings and modes to experiment with. Shooting Mode has a dial to select what type of shot you’re going to take including P (Programme Auto), S (Shutter Speed Priority) and M (Manual Exposure). If you’re not too sure about selecting your own camera settings and would rather just point and shoot, then there’s also a Basic and Auto mode.The Sony Xperia 5 III is a very powerful handset despite being so small. That's thanks to the high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 CPU that sits under the hood. You also get 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage which can be expanded using the MicroSD card slot.Using it was a breeze, apps opened up instantly and I didn't have any problems with excessive loading times. You’ll be able to use this for everything and anything, even more demanding mobile games like Call of Duty. To put it through its paces I used Geekbench 5’s benchmarking test where it scored 1,127 in single-core and 3,363 in multi-core. That's not far off other flagship phones like the OnePlus 9 Pro or the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus.The 4,500mAh battery is solidly okay. It seemed to easily last me the day of casual use, flicking through social media and watching a YouTube video here and there. I did need to charge it at the end of the day though.I ran a local video on full brightness over two hours and in that time the battery dropped by 12% so you’re looking at getting about 10 hours of video playback from it all in all. That’s nowhere near some flagship phones which can reach up to 20 hours.With the 30W charger included in the box, you can recharge from empty to 100% in just over 2 hours. You’ll want to leave it be because it did heat up a little when it was plugged in. You can also charge it wirelessly.Behind it all sits Android 11, lightly adjusted with Sony’s own take on it. As you would expect, it all feels sleek and intuitive with detailed menus. Admittedly it’s not quite as aesthetically pleasing as Samsung’s version of Android 11 or even pure Android. Everything looks sharp but it all feels much smaller and more grown-up than you get elsewhere.When you start up the phone for the first time, there are loads of apps you can choose to have pre-installed. That includes everything you’d expect from an Android phone like Google Photos, Google Maps and Google Meet. There's also a choice of games like Astro Shooter EX as well as streaming services like Netflix and Tidal.The Sony Xperia 5 III is a smartphone with a very clearcut purpose, to pack high-end hardware into a compact phone. And it does that very well.You can easily use this phone one-handed, and while the screen might be a fair amount smaller than you'd get elsewhere, it is still fine to use for watching videos on your commute or reading through the news.The focus here is on quality and that seeps down into every part of the phone, whether you’re talking about the speedy 5G processor, the sleek but sturdy design or the excellent snapper with loads of customisation. The only area where it slightly disappointed me was the battery life which could definitely be improved.If you want a powerful but compact phone and you don't mind paying a premium price for it, then this is the best one out there right now. It’d be hard not to recommend the Sony Xperia 5 III.The best small phone for most people is still the iPhone 12 Mini which has an even smaller screen at just 5.4inches. It’s not got the same long and thin design but it’s very compact. The battery life is average but even so, it looks great, has a fantastic camera system, packs in 5G and the screen is a beauty.Not a fan of iOS? Not everyone is, even though sometimes it may seem like they are. If you’re only looking at Android phones then the OnePlus 9 could be a good choice. Granted it is bigger than the Sony Xperia 5 III but the 6.55inch screen is housed in a slim and lightweight handset. It’s a very impressive phone all around.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/sony-xperia-5-iii-review
3,Apple iPhone 12,Apple iPhone 12 review: excellent in almost every way,"In this iPhone 12 review, I'll cover everything you need to know about this smartphone in 2021 after it's had a few software upgrades.In October 2021, the iPhone 12 was pushed out of the limelight by the brand new iPhone 13 which has naturally stolen the title of best iPhone for most people. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't consider the iPhone 12, because actually, you'll be able to get some great deals on it now.Out of the four 12-series of phones released back in 2020, the iPhone 12 is by far the most popular model because of its slightly more reasonable price tag. That doesn't mean it skimps on screen size though, with a 6.1inch display you'll still get plenty to work with.Compared to the iPhone 11, which came out in 2019 (and is still available now), there's a solid range of improvements across the device: an OLED screen replaces the LCD, and brings a noticeably higher resolution at the same size; the body is smaller and lighter; the cameras have a number of tweaks; and you've got an upgraded processor plus 5G wireless capability.However, the iPhone 12 also had a price rise compared to the launch price of the iPhone 11, which tempers the feeling of value from those improvements, and comes during a tough economic period. Here in 2021, we're often seeing it for around 20% cheaper than it was at launch, which helps a lot and that should go down even more now that iPhone 13 is available. So here's your extremely in-depth verdict on the iPhone 12, and just how impactful all these new features are, and how they balance with its price.Spoilers: it's one of the best phones you can buy in terms of its quality and performance, but its price means it's still out of reach of being among the best cheap phones, and that's a shame.Lastly, if you buy an iPhone 12 be sure to protect it with one of the best iPhone 12 cases – Apple's made its phones much tougher, but they're certainly not accident-proof yet.The iPhone 12 was released on October 23rd 2020, and its official price starts from £799/$799/AU$1,349. That includes 64GB of storage, which is… fine. It's a bit tight in a world where popular games can be 3GB easily, and when the device is your primary photo/video storage (though Apple's iCloud system is very good for this). The Google Pixel 5 starts significantly cheaper than this, but comes with 128GB, as an example of where the competition is at.You can step up to a model with 128GB, though, for a modest fee. For £849/$859/AU$1,429, you get the extra storage, which is what we'd suggest people do, particularly if you're paying monthly, since you'd barely notice the difference, and you give yourself a good amount of extra space.You can go bigger still, to a 256GB version. That'll cost you £949/$949/AU$1,599. Anything bigger than that and you're officially a 'pro' by Apple's standards – meaning you'll need to buy the iPhone 12 Pro.The price for this iPhone has risen when compared to the launch of the equivalent iPhone 11, as we've mentioned. That launched at £729/$699/AU$1,199, and actually represented a price drop from the iPhone XR that it, in turn, replaced.I can't say I'm a fan of seeing the price swing the other way here, and that's been a major factor between this getting full marks and the score it has – the complex relationship between the improvements and value will be a key part of my verdict at the end.However, while Apple still sells the iPhone 12 at that same price officially, there are lots of major discounts at retailers in the UK in particular, where you can now regularly get the cheapest iPhone 12 for under £700, so it's now much better value overall. You can see the current prices on both SIM-free and contract deals at the top of this review.It's worth noting that Apple has removed the headphones and charging adapter from the box in the iPhone 12 – it comes with only a Lightning-to-USB-C cable. It'll work with any adapter that has a USB-C plug, and Apple sells one for £19/$19.All of Apple's new phones from late 2020 feature a new design, which most closely resembles the design of the iPad Air (2020) and latest iPad Pros, and which many have compared to the iPhone 5-era devices, with flat sides, and severe corners.The new design doesn't feel like it's a blast from the past, though – just a new spin on the style Apple has always aimed for from the iPhone: a black oblong framed with a dash of colour or material.The iPhone 12's aluminium side frame and glass back come in five colours: black, white, red, green and blue. Unlike, say, the iPad Air where the colours tend to stick with all being quite pastel, here they run an interesting range. The black and white are as expected. The red is really vibrant, particularly on the glossy glass back, with the more matt metal sides toning down just a notch. The green is soft – pale and almost ice cream-y. The blue is deep and luxurious, like a velvet sofa in some influencer's video.It's the blue I had for this review, and I love it, especially in combination with the new design and the way the colour peeks around the edge of the whole front of the device.The iPhone 12 is significantly smaller than the iPhone 11, despite having the same-size screen. Removing the curves of the case and thinning the bezel around the screen's edge means that this phone is effectively the size of the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro – and is identical in size to the iPhone 12 Pro, in fact.Flat sides and smaller borders mean the screen is much easier to reach across with one hand, which is an improvement by any standard, though it's still a lot of height to reach to, especially for those with smaller hands. But that's just all phones these days… except the iPhone 12 Mini, of course.Holding and reaching around the phone is totally comfortable – the corners between the front/back and the sides might be a right angle, but the actual corners have been rounded slightly, so it feels no harsher on the hands than the old curved design.Basically, I think the new design is superior in every way – aesthetically, ergonomically and functionally. It's arguably the best-looking iPhone so far, which is a hotly contested category – for me, only the iPhone 12 Pro beats it, in fact.There's still the iPhone notch at the top, with Face ID security built in. This hasn't developed the sudden ability to work perfectly with masks, so I was surprised not to see fingerprint security make a comeback here as well, given that the new iPad Air has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that would be perfect. (Apple doesn't use under-screen fingerprint sensors, despite them appearing in lots of Android phones.)Apple has added a new mask-friendly feature for Apple Watch users, though: if you're wearing your Apple Watch and you try to use Face ID to unlock your phone while wearing a mask, your phone will use your Apple Watch to authenticate you instead. So it's not really scanning your face at all, but rather it's saying ""Well, I'm right next to the Watch, and that says it's connected to the right person, so I'll unlock"". This doesn't enable Apple Pay or really sensitive material, but it's very useful… as long as you have an Apple Watch too.Face ID continues to work extremely well for non-masked usage however, and though some still really hate the size and shape of the famous notch, I'm fine with it. I suspect Apple sees it as a recognisable design trait of the iPhone, like the Home button used to be, and it doesn't get in the way of 16:9 videos, so it's fine, really.Apple is using its new 'Ceramic Shield' glass on the front, which it says is four times tougher than other devices, so is more likely to survive drops. Now, here's a quick engineering lesson: toughness sounds like a generic term for glass strength, but it isn't. It means a material's ability to withstand impact without fracturing. The iPhone is less likely to shatter when dropped.This does not make it more scratch proof. Resistance to abrasions is known as hardness in glass. Diamond and sapphire are two of the hardest materials on the planet, which is why the iPhone camera lenses are sapphire – because you really don't want a scratch on them.Apple hasn't said anything about the new glass being harder, just tougher. Some people with iPhone 12s have noticed scratches, which makes them doubt the glass' quality. But that's a separate issue. I tell you this so that 1) you understand what's being promised, and why a scratched screen doesn't contradict this; and 2) so that you don't start rubbing your phone up against your keys assuming it'll be fine.Some people have dropped the new iPhones already, accidentally or to test them, and they have shown great drop resistance – more than you might expect from previous models. But whether a phone shatters or not is as much at the whims of fate as anything else, so don't be any less careful.The last new physical feature of the iPhone 12 is MagSafe: a ring of magnets on the back of the iPhone, hidden under the rear glass.This is for attaching accessories, including a new MagSafe wireless charger, which uses the magnets to align the wireless charger perfectly, meaning higher power delivery – 15W from Apple's new charger that you can buy.This is an interesting idea with some clearly useful applications, but one that I'm not blown away by, even in mid-2021, many months after launch. I've tried the MagSafe charger, which is effectively a replacement for plugging in the Lightning cable. Because of the magnets, the MagSafe charger doesn't stay on the table when you lift the phone, like other wireless chargers. This is useful in that it means you can continue charging while using the phone; but it takes away that little 'grab-and-go' advantage of other wireless chargers (which will still work, to be clear, but at slower speeds).The MagSafe charger also should have come with a 2m cable instead of a 1m one – getting a longer cables are one of the big reasons to buy yourself a new one. The MagSafe charger also doesn't come with a power adapter – it's just a USB-C plug on the other end. To charge at 15W, it needs to specifically use Apple's new 20W adapter, so that's an extra purchase.And it's also heavy! It makes the phone considerably heavier to hold, which a simple Lightning cable doesn't.Between all of this, I just don't see a major advantage for the simple MagSafe charger over using Lightning right new, given that Lightning is also more efficient. There are reasons to choose it, sure, I just don't see it as a clear upgrade.However, that's not all MagSafe does. The strength of magnets means it can be used to hold all kinds of accessories on – it's built into Apple's new cases for the iPhone 12, which can then hold a little card wallet you pop on and off at will.But, again, I have some caveats. I don't really like Apple's new silicon cases, which are actively slippery – more so than the phones themselves. This is quite a flaw for a case. Apple is making leather cases with MagSafe too, but if you use the MagSafe charger, Apple warns that it may mark the leather where it connects, which… yep, also kind of a flaw. And the magnetic card wallet isn't ideal if you keep your phone in your jeans pocket, because it sticks out the back and may well be knocked clean off when you slip the phone in there.However! The magnets are strong enough to mount the iPhone, so there are some interesting stands with MagSafe built in that could be really perfect – a Scosche charging car holder where you press the iPhone on and yoink it off seems great. A Belkin stand that can hold the iPhone to face you, either horizontally or vertically, on your desk while it charges also looks pretty useful.Aside from the design, the screen is the biggest upgrade from iPhone 11 to iPhone 12, and again it's a knockout. Instead of the LCD panel in its predecessor, the iPhone 12 has a beautiful OLED display that's also higher resolution, so you get a boost in a whole range of areas. In fact, it's nearly identical to the screen in the iPhone 12 Pro, and feels it.The screen is now 1170x2532, making it 460 pixels per inch – it's impossible to see individual pixels without glueing it to the end of your nose. It supports the P3 wide colour gamut, so everything is as vibrant and realistic as possible (and the camera takes photos with these wide colours, so you see the results regularly).It's also an HDR screen, which is primarily of use when watching HDR movies from Netflix, Disney+, iTunes etc. The iPhone supports Dolby Vision HDR, which is a more advanced form of HDR, and is delivered by all those services I just mentioned.When an HDR video demands it, the screen can peak its brightness as high as 1,200 nits, which is extremely impressive. Very few TVs can achieve this, and that includes flagship OLED TVs. Combined with the precision of OLED's self-emissive pixels, there's genuinely stunning contrast and realism here, whether that's more stylised blockbusters or just watching nature documentaries with the most true-to-life colours around.Compared to the lower-res LCD screen of the iPhone 11, it's a noticeable leap, and is a justifiable reason on its own to move to iPhone 12 for anyone with any LCD iPhone. However, there are some downsides: the OLED screen picks up more of a colour cast when viewed at an angle than the iPhone 11's LCD did; and OLED can be prone to image retention. I don't think the first downside here is an issue to worry about – the thing about phones is you largely look at the them dead-on.The second element also shouldn't be a dealbreaker, especially since OLED is now the standard on all phones at this level – it's just that if you have apps you use a lot with elements that don't move much, you might notice those elements 'ghosting' (being faintly visible) at times. I've seen this on older OLED phones, including the iPhone X – but obviously it's taken several years to get there. Just a warning.I said that the screen is almost identical to the iPhone 12 Pro's – they're the same resolution, and have the same HDR peak brightness. However, the typical brightness of the iPhone 12 is 625 nits (the same as the iPhone 11, and perfectly respectable) while the iPhone 12 has a typical brightness of 800 nits, which will make it more visible in bright sunlight. For the average buyer, this difference isn't all that impactful, actually – 625 nits is a really good level for normal use, and indoors it'll often dim itself to match the ambient light anyway.The iPhone 12 includes Apple's True Tone technology as well, which tweaks the colour balance of the screen depending on the lighting of the room you're in, to make your eyes more comfortable. We've all had the experience of being in our warm yellow indoor light and looking at a blue-tinted screen than feels harsh – Apple changes it so white on the iPhone's screen matches what white looks like in the room you're in, so it's more natural to read the screen. This has been around for years on most iPhones, so it's not new here, but it's a great feature for potential switchers to know about.For all of our waxing on about the new screen, there is one feature missing compared to other phones, though: a 90Hz or 120Hz screen. The iPhone's screen shows a new image 60 times per second (aka 60Hz), which has been the norm for phones and computers for a very long time.However, recently, Android phones in particular have started including screens that refresh 90 times per second, or 120 times per second. The advantage of these is that it makes motion look smoother and clearer – there's not much of a practical benefit on phones outside of gaming, but it's absolutely nicer. Once you try a high-refresh screen, going back feels a bit low-rent.It's not just Android flagships that have these screens – everything from the Pixel 5 (which is cheaper than the iPhone 12), to the OnePlus 8 Pro (which is a similar price to the iPhone) have them – so at this point, it's noticeable that the iPhone 12 is missing out.Missing out isn't a huge deal in the broader sense. As I mentioned, there isn't a major practical benefit to 90Hz or 120Hz, though it might sway some gaming fans. And there is a significant downside that possibly guided Apple here, which is that it's a big drain on battery life – some phones see a nearly 10% reduction with high refresh rates turned on.However, Apple has raised the price of the iPhone 12 compared to the iPhone 11, and has put it firmly in the territory where not having this kind of feature looks weaker as a question of value.As I mentioned, I don't think it's a dealbreaker – it's just a bit of a shame not to have the option given the price increase.The speakers on the iPhone 12 are excellent – Apple's been really stepping up the game here for the last few years, and it's surprising how clear and rich they are just for listening to music and podcasts on a whim.When watching a movie in landscape, they give a really impressive stereo effect too – sound moves not only across the screen, but also to the side of you, totally convincingly. It's very impressive, though admittedly most people will watch with headphones anyway.When it comes to camera specs, there isn't a huge amount of difference from the iPhone 11. The iPhone 12 Pro has some additional changes, but the new features here are small tweaks, not huge leaps forward.There are two rear cameras: one ultra-wide lens, and one wide-angle (which is the 'normal' lens type on phones), both with 12-megapixel sensors. The ultra-wide lens is roughly a 0.5x zoom compared to the wide – or, if you like, the wide is like a 2x zoom compared to the ultra-wide.The wide lens has a larger aperture this year (f/1.6 instead of f/1.8), which is great for low-light and Night mode shots especially, but also helps with crispness and colour vibrancy in any shot.The other differences are that the ultra-wide lens now has lens correction applied automatically so that its shots feature less distortion (though you can turn this off if you want the distorted look), and that Night mode is now possible on the ultra-wide lens and (more importantly) the front-facing camera.Being able to take Night mode selfies is a really nice addition, though is a little less of a slam dunk than taking them on the rear camera, since it's harder to hold the phone still and get a good angle of yourself. In my experience, Night mode selfies give you the best colours and overall look to a photo, plus flexibility over the angle and composition; the front flash (which is extremely bright thanks to that HDR screen) gives more detail for face-focused shots, but only illuminates the face, so isn't such an overall image improvement.Behind the scenes, Apple is doing more work thanks to the new processor. A new generation of smart HDR can identify different scenes and elements in photos to get everything exposed to its best, for example.The result of all this is a small but noticeable improvement over the iPhone 11, and one of the best dual-lens camera system on the market. Image detail is superb, colour vibrancy is excellent while still being natural, and exposure is handled deftly. The iPhone 12 makes it child's play to take beautiful shots.The iPhone 12's Smart HDR is demonstrated here. See how the shadowed leaf on the right and the petals in full sun both have lots of detail. [Click the image to see a 100% version]The iPhone's 12's Portrait mode in action. You can see its strengths and weaknesses here – the focus difference between the head and body is impressive and convincing, but the fur around the silhouette has been cut off a bit, as have the whiskers on the left. [Click the image for a 100% version]This landscape looks it could be a painting, with those uniform colours and even contrast. And, if you view this at 100%, you'll see that the detail looks quite painterly in places once Apple's processing has had its way. [Click the image for a 100% version]A shot to show detail. The iPhone's grasp of light and shadow makes this look truly three-dimensional, and zooming to 100% reveals every crack – very impressive.

This comparison shows the improvement in Smart HDR – the sky is equally well-exposed on both, but the grass, background and graffiti'd post are so much brighter and clearer on the 12.iPhone 12 on the left; iPhone 11 on the right. This is a mid-level light comparison– the iPhone 12 offers more true-to-life colours, while the iPhone 11 is a little cooler and flatter.As compared to last year's iPhones, the iPhone 12 just offers that extra step of conviction when it comes to colour and contrast – its photos aren't so much better they're transformative, but they're noticeable in medium or lower light, particularly, or contrasty scenes.They're easily as good as the best Android cameras, including the Galaxy S20 and Pixel 5, though we should note that the latter of these in particular is much cheaper than the iPhone. I prefer the iPhones to the highly saturated pics that Samsung produces (since you can always boost the saturation on these if you want).My only issues with the camera are that it's 'just' a dual-lens system at a flagship-type price. The iPhone 12 Pro has a third lens (a telephoto, for portraits), and given where the iPhone 12 fits into the overall market for price, it feels like this should have one as well. It would make this phone capable of even better Portrait mode shots of anything (its Portrait mode only works on people and pets, and pet hair is imperfectly handled, though it's certainly not bad).There is one more new feature to talk about, and that's Dolby Vision HDR video. The iPhone 12 (and 12 Pro) are the first cameras of any kind to 'shoot' in Dolby Vision – actually, they technically shoot in HLG HDR, which is converted to Dolby Vision, for those interested in such details.Dolby Vision is a form of HDR that adjusts the dynamic range on a scene-by-scene basis, optimising things depending on exactly what you've shot. If you have a new HDR TV, there's a good chance it supports Dolby Vision (unless it's a Samsung). Quite simply, this technology means videos recorded on iPhone can have a depth and realism that few cameras can match. They look fantastic… though so did the iPhone 11's videos and their 'Extended Dynamic Range', I have to say.Apple is touting this feature a lot, because it's a huge step forward, and unique to the new iPhones, so that's fair enough. But while videos on the iPhone 12 do look absolutely incredible (especially because Apple's video stabilisation is superb too), actually showing other people your videos at full quality is not that easy.If you want to AirPlay your video to an Apple TV or compatible TV, and if that setup supports Dolby Vision, you can view the video at full quality that way. But if you share your video online, the iPhone will automatically export a version at the quality/HDR level matching what the service tells the iPhone it can support. In theory, this is great – you start with the highest-quality version of your video, and the iPhone will create from that the best version that YouTube/Vimeo/Twitter etc can handle.But a video service may tell the iPhone the wrong info, meaning the conversion doesn't look right once a video has been uploaded – this has already resulted in problems with HDR videos from iPhone 12 looking washed out on Facebook/Instagram.So, Dolby Vision video is an extremely cool feature that looks fantastic in the places where you can take full advantage of it, but for most people, it's probably a bit too cutting edge to be a real selling point.If anything is the headphone feature of iPhone 12, it's 5G support. It's Apple's first phone with 5G, and it comes at a good time, when 5G is arriving in a lot of cities (in a limited capacity), but isn't so widespread that Apple looks late to the party.The 5G support that's here is comprehensive: in the US, every type of 5G is supported, including mmWave, which is where the truly hilarious speeds can come in, rather than just the mind-blowingly fast speeds. Elsewhere, there's no mmWave support (in most countries, including the UK, there are no current mmWave network plans), but again the phone will work on any 5G network as seamlessly as it will 4G or 3G.I took it for a 5G speed test, and hit 500Mbps. I was able to download a nearly 2GB film in a little over two minutes (which slower than that speed suggests, but one of the interesting things with internet that fast is that you don't know whether your downloads will be limited by the place you're downloading from).Even just regular web browsing is so quick that it feels weird – no waiting for images and text to pop in as a page loads. You hit go and the whole thing just appears at once. This is next-gen stuff, isn't it?Well, yes… and no. Here's the thing: I then switched 5G off, and standing in the exact same spot I ran a speed test on 4G. I got 250Mbps. That is, admittedly, only half as fast. But on the other hand, it's 250Mbps! That's 10 times faster than the average UK wired broadband.The way that 5G is being rolled out in many places, it's basically being added on as part of major upgrades of existing infrastructure, so where you get incredible 5G speeds, you'll often get incredible 4G speeds, raising the question of whether the 5G technology was really what we needed to make major improvements happen. (5G does have big benefits beyond pure bandwidth, but those will only really be of use when there's a real, continuous network of it.)And the 5G rollout has also proven to be a bit odd, and slower than originally expected (though this year hasn't exactly gone as planned in general, so that's fair enough). I had to head to a pretty random residential area in one corner of my city to try it. The city centre is not covered, nor is my neighbourhood.5G does also prove to be fairly battery hungry – those two minutes to download a film ate 3% of my battery. Apple has introduced 5G with an interesting default option: the iPhone will monitor how intensive your internet needs are when you begin a task, and will use 4G for simpler stuff, or will open the 5G floodgates for anything big. The idea is to help avoid 5G having a major battery impact. You can just switch to using 5G as the default, or you can turn 5G off and stick with 4G only.I've been kind of hard on 5G here, because I want to make sure you know what you're getting: a phone with the potential for incredible connection speeds, if you're in one of the few areas where 5G is active. The important part is that the iPhone is future-proofed for when 5G is more widespread – right now, it's great when you can make use of it, but it's not going to transform things instantly for everyone in the same way that the screen is an immediate and excellent upgrade.5G isn't the only speed upgrade in the iPhone 12. The new Apple A14 processor that powers it is around 20% faster than the A13 chip in the iPhone 11, and around 40% faster than the A12 in the iPhone XS and iPhone XR.Is there a leap in what you notice from iPhone 11 to iPhone 12? No, not especially. From iPhone XR to iPhone 12? A little bit. From iPhone 8 or earlier? Yep, it's a nice improvement.The main point of the advances in the A14 chip aren't so much the speed, because opening apps and moving around iOS are already really slick – there are lots of other things the chip does that are important.It's lower power than ever, balancing out some of 5G's drain; it can do more with photos enabling a bunch of the new camera features we mentioned; and it's comfortably future proofed to make sure the iPhone 12 can run whatever upgrades Apple has planned for years. That it's also more powerful than most laptops (and every other phone on the planet) is just bragging rights.We usually hope for year-on-year improvements to iPhone battery life, but compared to the iPhone 11, you're not really getting one here.Apple lists it and the 11 as having the same amount of battery life for watching video, though we actually saw especially strong battery life from it in our video test: watching an HDR movie on Netflix for two hours, with the brightness at maximum and the speaker volume at a third of full, reduced battery life by 14%. That was noticeably better than an iPhone 11 we ran the same rest on simultaneously, though the iPhone 11 wasn't brand new, so we can't call it an apples-to-apples comparison.The iPhone 12 is perfectly solid for battery life, but not excellent. With light use you can make it through two days – with typical lockdown use, expect to recharge it every night. If you use 5G regularly, that will also bring things down a little.The gist is: the battery life is fine. It's just not an advance, and it's pretty average compared to similarly priced phones.One small note about power: Apple doesn't officially include any word on reverse wireless charging, which many phone do these days. I don't mind that – it's a nice feature, but I've never personally found myself in need of it, even as someone who travels for work for days at a time (or, at least, used to). However, some people think they've uncovered that reverse charging may be included but hidden, ready for some future accessory – we'll see.The iPhone 12 is the iPhone most people should get right now – it gives you a stunning new design, a fantastic new screen compared to the iPhone 11, excellent cameras with a few new tricks, plus 5G and the world's fastest phone processor for future-proofing.The cost is the only real stumbling block – at full price, it has stepped just over the line where we can safely say it represents unquestionably great value. It's wandered back into flagship price territory, really, but it doesn't offer the triple-lens camera system we'd expect at that level, or the extra storage.However, with the 20% or so discounts we're seeing, it comes back to the upper-mid-range level that it's more comfortable at, and our few objections definitely soften. As a phone, I love it – it's so slick, it's beautiful, and everything works so damn well.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/iphone-12-review
4,DJI Osmo OM5 Gimbal,DJI Osmo OM5 Gimbal review: smarter selfies,"The DJI Osmo OM5 is the latest version of DJI’s phone gimbal system. If you want to shoot video on your phone, you need a gimbal. This motor-controlled holder keeps your phone steady as you bounce around. The OM5 creates smooth, gently panning video that looks much, much better than handheld. There isn’t a lot here to persuade owners of previous DJI OM models to upgrade, though, unless they have an urgent need for the selfie-stick style extension that puts the phone at a longer distance from you. But for those who haven’t used a gimbal before, it is an eye-opening experience, making your videos much smoother, easier to watch, and just nicer, while also adding a range of new features and shooting modes.The OM5 looks like a prop gun from a 1970s Sci-Fi movie, with a rounded plastic handle with several thumb controls and a fold-out phone holder. At the end of the phone holder is a magnetic plate that the phone attaches to. To use this, you attach a spring-loaded clamp to your phone which has a matching magnetic plate attached. Bring this near the one on the end of the OM5 gimbal arm and the two snap together, holding the phone in place.It sounds a bit like a mad scientist creation, but it works, and it is strong enough to hold heavy phones. I tested it with a Samsung Note 20 and a Samsung Fold 3, and both were held firmly and tightly in place during our tests (although, to be fair, DJI does produce a list of approved devices for the OM5, which does not include the Fold 3). That’s good, but personally, I would like to have a backup strap or cable in place just in case the magnets aren’t strong enough to prevent my $1800 phone from falling off when I am waving it around, especially when using the extension rod.Previous versions of the Osmo gimbal also included a magnetic plate that would stick to the phone or a phone case, but this is now only available as an extra-cost add-on. DJI told me that this was because they found that people preferred the spring-loaded clamp, as it doesn't need to be permanently attached to the phone.I did find, however, that these heavy phones strained the gimbal. Sometimes, the motors would produce an ominous buzzing sound while moving, and I did have occasional errors where the motors overheated and stopped working for a while.The major addition to this new version is the aforementioned extension rod; a selfie-style telescoping stick between the handle and the cell phone holder. This can extend up to about 8.4 inches in six sections. It can be used as a selfie stick by extending the rod, then switch to the front-facing camera. Because the extension rod has the entire gimbal assembly at the end, the stabilization still works, although it is not as effective as hand movements tend to get amplified by the length of the rod, and there is only so much that the gimbal can do to correct for them.It has other uses than taking selfies, though. With the control over the pan and tilt of the phone even when extended, you can shoot high shots without having to stand on a ladder. It certainly makes the phone a more useful camera.You can’t really use the extension rod for low shots. When I tried, the gimbal wasn’t able to move the phone to properly orient it to shoot low-angle video due to the limitations of how far the gimbal can move the phone.The gimbal is controlled through a combination of the physical controls on the handle and the DJI Mimo app.DJI Osmo OM5 phone mountThe OM5 requires some practice to use effectively. Getting your phone mounted on the gimbal with the clamp is fairly simple but works best without a phone case. Once the phone is in place, you turn the gimbal on by pressing and holding the mode button. The gimbal then runs through a short calibration routine, where it moves the phone to figure out where it is. The joystick control is used to pan and tilt the phone while the gimbal corrects for handshakes and small movements.Next to the joystick are two smaller buttons: the switch and the record buttons. The function of the record button is fairly obvious, starting a video or taking a photo depending on the capture mode. The switch button has a couple of functions: press it once and it switches between front and back cameras. Press it twice and it rotates the phone from portrait to landscape mode. In addition, a slide control on the side of the handle controls the zoom of the camera.Above the zoom slider is the Mode button. press it once to check the battery, twice to put the device into standby mode, and four times to change modes. If you press and hold while the gimbal is turned on, it turns off.There is also a trigger control on the front of the handle which activates the ActionTrack feature. This will detect a moving object in the frame (a face or an animal) and track it, panning and tilting the camera to keep it in the frame. Press the trigger twice and you activate the gimbal lock, which keeps the camera facing in the same direction however you move.Other functions are controlled through the DJI Mimo app. You can set the gimbal to track and follow an object on the screen, lock the tilt so that the camera can only pan and not tilt up and down or FPV mode, where it will keep it steady and pointing ahead as you walk. You can also control the speed of the reactions of the gimbal and enable special shooting modes.These special modes include Hyperlapse, where the camera takes a photo every few seconds and combines them into a video, producing a feeling of speeding along a path. Dynamic Zoom creates what film people call a dolly zoom, where you combine zooming in with moving the camera away to create a dramatic look There is also a useful panorama mode, which automatically rotates the camera, takes three photos, and combines them into a single shot.In addition, Story mode guides you through taking a series of short videos, then edits them together around a specific theme, complete with music and motion graphics. These fall into the cute rather than the useful category, though.DJI Osmo OM5 foldedI was generally impressed with the performance of the OSMO OM5, which did an excellent job of making the video look smoother and more attractive. The Active Track feature also worked well: press the trigger once and the app identifies a moving object in the frame (such as a face or a dog) and pans the phone around to keep the object in the frame. It isn’t perfect, though, and if the person (or dog) moves too fast, it can lose track and you have to find it again by panning the camera and pressing the trigger once more.The photo features are also useful, and occasionally amusing, options. The Panorama photo mode takes a series of photos (either three horizontally in a row or a grid of nine) then stitches them together. The Clone Me mode is also fun: it takes three shots with a time gap between so you can move from spot to spot and then stitches them together into a wide shot. So, you can be in the same photo three times. Both of these produced impressive and amusing results.The extension rod is definitely a cool feature. It allows you to put the camera higher and lower than before, as well as the standard selfie shot. However, it does struggle, especially with larger phones like the Note 20 Ultra I used in testing. That’s a lot of mass to move around when compensating for movements, and the motors did occasionally produce a bee-like buzzing sound that was recorded by the phone. The motors did also overheat a couple of times, producing an error message and halting the gimbal until they cooled off.The DJI Mimo app is also a little rough around the edges. I downloaded the latest version from the DJI site (version 1.6.4) which worked pretty well, but I did get the odd error message or notification in Chinese, especially when using the special shooting modes.Some of these special modes are also compromised by some odd choices. The Dynamic Zoom, for instance, uses a digital zoom, where the program zooms in on the video by cropping it down rather than using the zoom lens on the phone. This reduces the quality of the video significantly and by the end, when it has zoomed in a fair way, it looks like it was shot with a cheap old camcorder. That’s frustrating when the phone we tested with has a very decent zoom lens that isn't used.It is also lacking some pro features that I would like to see. You can’t, for instance, program a move into the device that it can repeat on request, which would make it great for special effects work. You can program a time-lapse that pans or tilts, though, moving over a period of between a few seconds and 24 hours.But it isn’t perfect. It takes some time to learn how to use, and while the extension rod is cool, it exaggerates some movements, which makes the video look worse. If you are an OM4 user, there really isn’t enough here to justify an upgrade, but if you are sick of shaky cell phone videos and want to make your travel movies look better, it is a great choice that won’t weigh you down.The DJI Osmo OM5 is an excellent gimbal and improves the quality of the videos that you shoot with your phone. It is also pretty cheap. For $159/£139, you get the gimbal, carrying bag, mini tripod, and clamp to attach it to most phones. It folds down to a compact package that will fit into a small bag or camera case.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/dji-osmo-om5
5,iPhone 13 Pro Max,iPhone 13 Pro Max review: the ultimate iPhone,"The iPhone 13 Pro Max review in a nutshell: with a higher-res screen and the longest battery life of any iPhone, it’s arguably the best phone of Apple’s iPhone 13 line-up. However, the only difference from the smaller iPhone 13 Pro is screen size and battery, so it’s only worth paying the extra for the Max if you really prioritize those things.Otherwise, it has all of the new additions that the iPhone 13 Pro boasts, from the upgraded triple-lens camera system to the 120Hz ProMotion screen, to the most powerful phone processor ever.And that’s building on what was already so great about the iPhone 12 Pro Max – including the gorgeous stainless frame, Apple ProRaw photo support, and the incredible Dolby Vision HDR screen.It’s a great beast of a phone, ticking off almost all the things people wanted from the iPhone Pro Max this year, and improving all of the basics along the way. If you want a giant phone that’s a super-premium experience in every way, this is it.The iPhone 13 Pro Max was released on 24 September 2021.The price for the cheapest version (relatively speaking) is £1,049/$1,099/AU$1,849, which comes with 128GB of storage.You can upgrade to 256GB of storage for £1,149/$1,199/AU$2,019, 512GB for £1,349/$1,399/AU$2,369 or – for the first time – a colossal 1TB of storage for £1,549/$1,599/AU$2,719.No surprise, this is the most expensive model in Apple’s iPhone range, especially in the larger sizes, but if you’re planning to take a lot of high-quality photos and video with it, maybe it’s exactly what you’ve been waiting for.The new features for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, like all good things, come in threes. There's a huge update to the rear camera array, a spectacular new screen with ProMotion that brings 120Hz refresh to the iPhone for the first time, and a bigger battery for longer usage.The camera upgrade is significant, even if on the surface it looks like the same triple camera set up as before. All three cameras are brand new. There's a larger sensor and wider aperture on the main camera, the ultra-wide now offers macro focusing down to 2cm (plus a wider aperture) and the telephoto lens is longer, with an equivalent of 77mm. All three also allow for night mode shooting.The Super Retina XDR display is brighter than before and features Apple's ProMotion technology. This allows for a variable refresh rate from as little as 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz, depending on the current need.Battery life has benefited from the variable refresh rate and the new A15 Bionic processor, but also thanks to a larger capacity battery. This now offers a 2.5-hour improvement on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, giving users up to 28 hours of video playback.There's no big design change for the iPhone 13 range, so the 13 Pro Max looks very similar to the previous model. There are giveaways though. On the front, the camera notch is not as wide – a reduction of 20%. It is still the same height though, so it doesn't actually give you more screen space. It just means a little more room for battery, Wi-Fi, data and network icons.That screen is still protected by the ceramic shield, which is designed to be more durable and protect against drops and knocks. The phone has an IP68 water resistance, which means that it is rated for submersion at depths over one meter for 30 minutes. As on the previous models, the sidebands are surgical grade stainless steel, and have been color-matched to this year's four color options.In addition to the Graphite, gold and silver versions, there is a new Sierra blue model, replacing last year's Pacific blue. This is a much lighter blue, almost silvery in color. This year's gold also feels a little lighter, giving it a more subtle and classy feel.On the rear, the camera positioning remains the same but the raised section and lenses are more pronounced. The difference is millimeters, but when the phones are put back to back, you can see the difference. Thankfully the cases for the iPhone 13 Pro Max allow for this and once on, you would never know it was any different.Of course, if you do opt for one of the leather or silicone Apple cases for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, you won't see much of the body color, aside from the small area underneath the clear camera array. With a phone of this size and expense, I would definitely recommend keeping it in a sturdy case for extra protection.The sheer size of the iPhone 13 Pro Max has pros and cons. On the one hand, it's rather large to fit in a pocket and the expanse of the screen makes it impossible to operate fully with one hand. On the other hand, the payoff is that incredible screen. Watching any content on it instantly looks better than on a smaller device.The display on the iPhone 13 Pro Max is 6.7 inches, and that is large. Accordingly, it has a high resolution of 1284x2778, which works out as a razor-sharp 458 pixels per inch.Like last year’s model, it supports Dolby Vision HDR, and hits peak brightness of 1,200 nits for HDR content, which is excellent – even the majority of high-end TVs don’t deliver that much brightness.But this year’s 13 Pro models are also brighter when it comes to general use, too. Previously, the Pro models maxed at 800 nits of brightness for regular use, but they can now hit 1,000 nits in bright light, so that what’s on the screen is more visible.The headline feature on the screen, of course, is support for refresh rates up to 120Hz – all previous iPhones were 60Hz. Refreshing the screen twice as often means anything moving on it looks smoother and clearer – so that can be animations, but also when you’re scrolling through lists or webpages, you can actually see what’s going past, instead of it being a blurry smear.This tech can hammer battery life, but Apple uses it smartly, thanks to tech it calls ProMotion. Basically, the iPhone dynamically shifts how often it refreshes the screen depending on what’s happening. Scrolling? It’ll ramp up to 120Hz. Watching a video? It’ll drop to 60Hz or 30Hz to match the video. If you’re just reading still pages of an ebook, it can drop to 10Hz to save battery.I'd never felt that the iPhone's screen needed a greater refresh rate, until I tried the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Now going back to the 12 Pro Max feels really juddery in comparison. Basic browsing through photos and websites instantly looks smoother and gives the whole OS a more premium feel.The real benefit of course comes in gaming. I tried out the new Catalyst Black game, which is due out this December. This team-based battle arena game makes use of the 120Hz fresh rate and playing it on both the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the iPhone 13 (which doesn't have the high refresh rate), you can notice the difference in movement.There are a number of games that already support 120Hz playing, including many of the Apple Arcade titles. I expect many more existing games will update to make use of the technology in the coming months.Unlike last year, where the iPhone 12 Pro Max had the best camera on any of the iPhone models, this time it merely has the joint best camera, because it and the 6.1-inch iPhone 13 Pro are totally equal in this department. The one advantage the Pro Max has is that the new massive camera bump doesn’t seem quite as massive here, since the entire phone is equally massive.So you’ve got a triple-cam setup on the rear, with a 12MP f/1.8 ultra-wide (120°) camera, a 12MP f/1.5 wide-angle camera, and a 12MP f/2.8 3x telephoto lens. This means you’ve got a total zoom range of 6x, because the wide-angle is 0.5x to the wide-angle, and the telephoto is 3x.This is largely the same setup as last year, except they’re actually all very different. The wide and ultra-wide both have larger apertures to let in more light, and while the telephoto has a smaller aperture, that’s because it’s a longer zoom than Apple’s ever used before.The sensors on all of them are new too, and capture more light – and when you combine that with the wider apertures and image stabilization on all three lenses (including ultra-advanced sensor-shift stabilization on the wide-angle) they promise a major boost in low-light performance – Apple says they can capture fully 50% more light. And, in fact, Night mode is now available on all three lenses for the first time.And the lenses have a final trick: the ultra-wide lens can be used for macro photography with a focal distance of 2cm, which is a first for iPhones.Unlike non-Pro iPhones, you have a LiDAR sensor in the camera setup, which is used to help to autofocus in low light, so you can actually get focused and shot before the moment passes.On top of all this, Apple has stepped up its image processing game again, with a new chip in the A15 processor that focuses on noise reduction and tone mapping, and provides the next generation of Apple’s great Smart HDR processing for high-contrast scenes.Part of that is the addition of a new ‘Photographic Styles’ feature, which effectively lets you choose a slightly different processing preset when you shoot. It’s not like applying a filter to a picture that’s already been taken – the iPhone is adjusting how it handles things like color and contrast during shooting, so that you can choose a preset with more color saturation, say, but it won’t make skin tones look fake. The presets are Standard, Vibrant, Rich Contrast, Warm, and Cool.And, of course, the Pro iPhones include Apple’s ProRaw shooting option, so you can shoot in a format that gives the editing flexibility of raw photos, but without losing the Apple core image processing on noise reduction and tone handling that small sensors like these really need.With direct comparison shots on both the iPhone 13 Pro Max and the 12 Pro Max, it's possible to see the improvements in the cameras. Fine detail reveals less noise in standard shots across all three lenses. The night mode has also been tweaked to give a truer representation of the scene – leaving the image darker overall.The important thing about the iPhone 13 Pro Max camera array is that it gives the photographer the choice of how to capture an image. Using the ultra-wide, wide and telephoto lenses leads to very different results as you can see below. Each one looks great in its own right though.Having the option to shoot in ProRaw is a big pull of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, as it means that you can get the very best out of an image. However, the results of Apple's own processing in the HEIC format files are so good that I rarely found myself using it.The front camera hasn’t had quite as much love as the rear camera, alas. It’s still a 12MP sensor with f/2.2 lens, but it benefits from all the new processing options, including Photographic Styles.Night mode: iPhone 12 Pro Max (left), iPhone 13 Pro Max (right)Ultra-wide-angle camera: iPhone 12 Pro Max (left), iPhone 13 Pro Max (right)Even in nighttime mode, the Portrait setting allows you to take really natural shots – this one using the wide lens.When it comes to video, there are two huge new additions, but for the most part, things are the same as the iPhone 12 Pro. You can record video at up to 4K 60fps in Dolby Vision HDR, or 1080p 240fps. All video naturally benefits from the cameras letting in more light, which is the main quality improvement here.However, there are two brand-new things these phones can do. Well, three, but one isn’t available at launch.First is the fact that you can also record video in Macro mode, which is a very cool option to have.The really big one is Cinematic Mode, though. The simple way to explain this is that it’s like Portrait Mode for video, in that you can choose something to be in focus, and a fake depth-of-field blur is applied to the rest, giving you that rich cinematic look.But that’s only the surface of what it does, because it also uses AI smarts to track what’s happening while you record, and will smoothly shift the focus automatically when it thinks it needs to, kind of like a focus puller would on a film. So if someone turns away from the camera to look at someone else, it will shift the focus from the first person to the second, for example.But you don’t have to rely on its smarts. After the video is recorded, you can still choose what should be in focus, and you can manually shift the focus throughout the scene, long after you stopped shooting. You can also choose how deep the focus should be, so you can go super blurry, or a little more measured.The only downside to Cinematic Mode is that, while it still records in Dolby Vision HDR, the resolution is limited to 1080p rather than 4K.While I can't see many pro videographers making use of the Cinematic mode, it definitely has appeal for more casual filmmakers and even film students working on a low budget. The effects are really impressive, especially if you take the time to adjust the focus changes in the edit afterward. The ability to make these changes is also coming to iMovie, which will be really handy too.The final of the three new features is ProRes support. ProRes is an existing format for high-quality video editing, used in some pro cameras and editing suites. Apple is planning to bring it to iPhone 13 Pro, though we don’t exactly know what that will mean, other than that it’ll be a higher-quality option. ProRes is really a family of formats, so what we get – if not a new format that’s semi-related – remains to be seen. In any case, it’ll probably be what justifies buying a 1TB iPhone: ProRes video is large.The iPhone 13 Pro Max uses Apple’s new A15 Bionic processor, which is the most powerful chip in any phone to date. And while the iPhone 13 and iPad mini (6th Gen) also use the A15, it is specifically the version in the Pro and Pro max that’s the most powerful of all.Here, you get more RAM (useful for features such as ProRaw or ProRes recording), and a 5-core GPU.The more powerful GPU is great for keeping things totally smooth on the ProMotion screen, and for making sure that any games that want to function at really high framerates to take advantage of it can do so.General operation here is seamless and fast, even when using iMovie and Garage Band, which are memory intensive. Using Geekbench, the iPhone 13 Pro Max delivered a multi-core score that was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 12 Pro Max.Apple has improved the 5G on its latest phones, though mostly to enable better worldwide support. You’ve still got support for up to mmWave speeds in the US, and standard 5G elsewhere.Using T-Mobile's Ultra Capacity 5G – which is it's name for the mmWave 5G band – I was able to get download speeds of almost 500Mbps and upload speeds of over 40Mbps. This makes anything from video calls to movie streaming a breeze and feels like you're on Wi-Fi.Of course, battery is one area where the Pro Max stands out above the other models. A bigger body means more space for battery capacity, and based on Apple’s quoted figures, you should get 20-25% more life from the Pro Max than the regular iPhone 13 Pro, and potentially around 50% more than the iPhone 13.While I never had any issue with the battery life on the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the 13 Pro Max does seem to be offering even more usage time. I took the phone out for some fairly heavy photography testing and then continued using it the following day. It was only after 48 hours that the phone suggested switching to low power mode, as the battery had gone under 20%.Basically, if longevity is your major priority, then the Pro Max is definitively the iPhone 13 model you should go for, as long as you’re happy with its bulky size.The iPhone 13 Pro Max is an extremely impressive phone. It delivers in every area, from the excellent camera array to the 120Hz screen and the long-life battery. If having the very best in all these areas is important, then this is the phone for you.In previous models, the Pro Max has offered camera improvements over the Pro version – from sensor-shift technology to longer lenses. That's not the case this year and it vastly benefits the Pro model. It's a sensible decision and one I pushed for in the past but it will be interesting to see if it affects sales of the Pro Max. I know I'd be more tempted to go for the Pro this year.Having another phone that's almost as good though doesn't take away from the fact that the iPhone 13 Pro Max is the best there is. And for that reason, it deserves its five-star score.If you're happy with a slightly smaller screen and a couple of hours less battery life, you should definitely consider the iPhone 13 Pro. This year, there is less difference between the iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, so the battery and screen sizes are the only differences. With prices starting from $999/£949 for the 13 Pro, it's also $100/£100 cheaper.If you are looking for a large-screen phone for photography, there are also a few Android phones worth considering. The Samsung S21 Ultra boasts a slightly larger 6.8-inch 120Hz screen and adds a second longer telephoto camera to the mix. Also, the Oppo Find X2 Pro has a 6.7-inch 120Hz screen and a triple camera array with a periscope 5x optical lens.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/iphone-13-pro-max
6,iPhone 13,iPhone 13 review: a phone for everyone,"In this iPhone 13 review, we’re looking at what will likely be the most popular model in the new iPhone range, although there are two more advanced models above it. It promises the perfect balance of features and price, and naturally, it also looks and feels great in the hand.There’s a good reason why the iPhone 12 has topped our best phone guide since its launch, and the iPhone 13 is a worthy replacement, delivering smart and genuinely useful upgrades where they’re most wanted.You’ve got even better cameras, especially in dimmer light; more battery life; more storage; a brighter screen that’s more visible in sunlight; a faster and more efficient processor… all of these mean that the experience of using the iPhone day-in, day-out is excellent.Apple hasn’t tried to throw in some whizzy new feature or design just for the sake of it – it’s focused on making sure the iPhone delights you where it can, and doesn’t disappoint where it shouldn’t.The iPhone 13 was released on 24 September 2021.If you buy SIM-free, the price starts from £779/$799/AU$1,349 for the 128GB version. This is an excellent starting size, and I doubt most people will feel the need to go larger than this. Heavy users may find that they hit the limit of this size, especially if you download a lot of games or want to record a ton of video, but most users likely won’t have a problem.If you do need to go for a bigger capacity, though, you can get a 256GB version for £879/$899/AU$1,519, or go for a hefty 512GB for £1,079/$1,099/AU$1,869.The iPhone 13’s upgrades are subtle this year but when you add them all up they amount to a significant change over the iPhone 12. On the camera side, there are new sensors on both of the rear cameras and the new Cinematic mode for shallow focus video. The latest A15 Bionic chip features a 6-core CPU and a 4-core graphics processor. The 16-core Neutral Engine is also brand new and is designed to better handle photography tasks.On top of that, there’s a bigger battery, which along with the more efficient processor, helps to provide longer battery life. The Super Retina XDR screen is brighter and there are more 5G bands for greater 5G coverage.At a quick glance, it would be difficult to differentiate the iPhone 13 from the iPhone 12. It has the same flat edges and an almost identical bezel. Seeing as the iPhone 12 was possibly the best-looking phone to date though, that’s no bad thing.Despite not having the stainless-steel bands of the Pro models and having a glossy rather than matte glass back, the iPhone 13 still feels like a premium device. It certainly doesn’t have the plasticky feel of many Android devices.The plus side of not having the steel bands of the Pro model and using aluminum instead is that it’s lighter than the Pro – it weighs 173g, while the iPhone 13 Pro weighs 203g, and you’d be amazed how much you notice that 30g difference. The iPhone 13, like the iPhone 12 before it, is just easier to hold and shift around in your hand than the Pro version.This year’s range comes in a choice of five colors: pink, blue, midnight (black), starlight (white) and (Product)Red. The model I tested was finished in pink but rather than being garish, this light pastel shade looks grown-up, and the sides could almost be mistaken for rose gold.While the color choice is nice, if you’re going to be putting a case on your iPhone – which, let’s face it, most of us are – you are unlikely to see it, aside from when you remove your SIM card or the small window you can see under the camera bump. The range of silicon and leather Apple cases for the iPhone match all the available colors and give more options, such as the clover green, a more vibrant pink pomelo, and marigold orange. Apple offers a clear case, too, if you want your original color to show through.The diagonal mounting of the dual cameras is also more pleasing to the eye and feels more balanced than the previous vertical alignment. The camera bump is larger but is disguised by the fact that the outer bump is completely see-through.On the front, the camera notch is clearly smaller, at least in width. This seems to have been achieved by making the speaker grill longer and thinner, and moving it to the very top of the sensors in the notch rather than dividing them. The result is that the battery, Wi-Fi and network signal are fractionally larger and don’t seem as squidged in. It doesn’t seem to have any other advantages and while I’d rather it wasn’t there at all, it doesn’t really offend me either.Many users were hoping that this model would make the switch to USB-C charging, as the iPad Air, iPad mini and MacBook have in recent releases. However, that wasn’t to be for this year and the iPhone 13 keeps the Lightning connector, which does at least mean those old chargers and accessories will still work. Those of us who remember the pain of switching from Firewire to USB on the iPods or 30-pin to Lightning on the iPhone will be pleased not to have to refresh a collection of leads built up over many years.Having used all sizes of iPhone over the years, I have to say that the iPhone 13 is the perfect size for me. While I love the screen size of the Pro Max models and the pocketability of the iPhone mini, the 6.1-inch display is big enough for video and web browsing, while you can still hold the phone comfortably and type with one hand. And while my thumb can’t reach the top of the display, the new lower address bar in Safari means even that is manageable.The iPhone 13’s screen is very similar to the iPhone 12’s, in that it’s a 6.1-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1170x2532. That makes it a razor-sharp 460 pixels per inch, and it’s borderline impossible to make out individual pixels.It still supports features such as the P3 wide color gamut and True Tone, and there’s Dolby Vision HDR, with the display boosting its maximum brightness to a TV-beating 1,200 nits when watching HDR movies.The only real change in the display this year is the brightness during general use when outdoors – it can now boost itself to 800 nits of maximum brightness, which is a big increase from the 625 nits that the iPhone 12 managed.The difference in this display compared to the iPhone 12 is subtle, but when you compare identical images and videos it’s possible to see a little more brightness from the iPhone 13. That’s no criticism though. Like the iPhone 12, this screen looks stunning, with deep blacks and rich, lifelike colors. Watching shows like Earth at Night on Apple TV – which has both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound – is crisper and more lifelike than on most TVs.The contrast of the screen is as good outdoors as it is inside, and remains easy to view even in bright sunny conditions thanks to that extra brightness, which helps what’s on the screen to punch through reflections.Sure, the lack of ProMotion technology here means that the refresh rate is limited to 60Hz, and you can see a difference compared to phones that have high-refresh rates, but unless you’re planning on lots of gaming on this phone, you probably won’t miss it in any real ways. I’m sure future versions of the standard iPhone will eventually get 120Hz, but not having it here isn’t a deal-breaker.The speakers provide ample volume for a true movie experience in your hand. Putting the phone in landscape orientation will give you the true stereo effect, with that slim new top speaker balancing the grills at the base of the phone. This provides an impressively wide soundscape while placing any narration right in the center of the screen. There’s plenty of bass as well as detailed mids and high end – in Billie Eilish’s I didn’t change my number, you can feel that bass drum pedal and almost picture the stick hitting the high hat.The rear camera system in the iPhone 13 isn’t very different from the iPhone 12 or even the iPhone 11 when you look at the headline features: a dual-camera setup, with one wide-angle lens and one ultra-wide lens, both with a 12MP sensor.But the performance here is noticeable improvement over the iPhone 12 in a lot of situations, and a big step up from the iPhone 11 (which was not exactly a slouch in the ol’ camera department).It’s all about how the cameras work: the sensors let in more light this time, which means they can capture more realistic colours and sharper details, and can take clearer low-light shots.Adding to the low-light improvement is the new sensor-shift image stabilization, which means that the iPhone can use a slower shutter speed for low-light shots, because when your hand shakes subtly during the photo, the phone actually moves the sensor in the opposite direction to cancel it out, avoiding any smearing.Apple has also upgraded its image processing and added a new ‘Photographic Styles’ feature. These basically allow you to choose different presets for how the iPhone processes the image – you can shot them more to your taste without applying a filter after. Filters are dumb, and work on the whole photo equally – Photographic Styles are smarter, with different parts of the shots being handled differently, so they can do things like make colors bolder without changing skin tones.The choices are Standard, Vibrant, Rich Contrast, Warm, and Cool. So, if you’re actually a fan of the way Samsung’s cameras produce more saturated colours than Apple’s, now you can have the iPhone shoot more like that instead.The images from the iPhone 13 have reduced the amount of noise compared to the iPhone 12. This is likely a result of that larger aperture and sensor, but also some improved processing.The exposure is also a little better balanced. The shadows give more detail while highlights remain well controlled. Thanks to the Smart HDR 4, it manages to do this while keeping a very natural look to the image.Night mode provides a slightly darker-looking image than we saw from the iPhone 12. This looks more natural, keeping that nighttime feel, rather than making it look more like daylight.The combination of wide and ultra-wide lenses on the iPhone 13 cover most bases, with the ultra-wide providing some really dynamic landscapes and portraits. However, those looking for more classic portraits will miss having a longer lens, like on the 13 Pro.Ultra-wide-angle camera: iPhone 12 (left), iPhone 13 (right)Night mode: iPhone 12 (left), iPhone 13 (right)The images that come out of the iPhone 13 are impressive in any light. This dusk shot shows excellent exposure and detailThe iPhone 13 handles exposure extremely well and allows you to create great shots in any light.When it comes to video, you’ve got the ability to record in 4K at up to 60fps with Dolby Vision HDR, or if you drop to 1080p you can record in slo-mo at up to 240fps (enabling an 8x slowdown).The overall quality of the video is impressive from the iPhone 13, especially in its 4K mode. Thanks to the new sensor-shift stabilization, it’s possible to get a really smooth panning shot by hand and by with a long press on the zoom value, you can use the dial to gently zoom in and out, rather than just jumping between lenses.When shooting in the slower 24 and 30 fps modes, you do see some rolling shutter when panning fast over hard vertical lines, such as door frames. However, when set to 60fps this doesn’t show. Instead, the slight delay of the stabilization is noticeable.There’s also a whole new way to record video: Cinematic Mode. This is like a Portrait Mode for video, in that it enables you to create a fake depth-of-field with your subject in sharp focus, making things look very premium and, yes, cinematic.But it’s much, much smarter than that. While you’re recording, the iPhone can detect when the focus should change – to someone who’s just walked into shot, say, or to an object that someone turned to look at – and does this automatically and smoothly, giving it a look as if a professional camera operator is controlling it.Even better is that after you’ve finished recording, you can actually then change the focal point of the videos if you want, including shifting it around multiple times during a single piece of video. You can also choose how deep the focus should be, just like when editing Portrait Mode still photos.I’ve been playing around with the Cinematic mode for a couple of days and while it does work pretty well, it can struggle in low light and has a tendency to hunt in certain situations. This is especially the case for busier dark scenes.Being able to edit the focus changes once you’ve finished taking the shot is incredible and something that I’m sure every director wishes they could do with their camera. You can control the overall level of blur (by changing the f-stop effect from f/2 all the way to f/16), and the focus shifts, manually. You can even delete focus changes that were made while recording. In the coming months, both iMovie and Final Cut Pro X will allow you to change the focus in the software too.It’s possible here because the bokeh, or blur, you are seeing in the image isn’t a result of the lens, it’s essentially an effect that is added to the file, as in portrait mode. Even with these wider aperture lenses, the iPhone will keep most of the scene in focus, from a couple of meters to infinity. Because of this, the raw image and the blur effect can be saved and edited separately.Cinematic mode is available from the front camera, the rear main camera and the 77mm telephoto camera on the 13 Pro and Pro Max. You can’t use the ultra-wide-angle camera or choose the wider view from the front camera. It is also only available in 1080P at 30fps and not 4K – though it does use Dolby Vision.While it’s unlikely to be used by professional filmmakers (ProRes is likely to have a bigger impact), it is a great tool for those budding amateurs looking to create better-looking movies. I would recommend ignoring the automatic focus changes and manual adjustments while recording and simply do it all in the edit. If it does change when you want it to, it’s simply a bonus. Otherwise, you can add them exactly where you want them after and without risking noisy thuds in the audio as you tap on the screen.The iPhone 13 is powered by Apple’s newest phone processor: the A15. There’s no huge leap forward in how fast it feels in general use compared to the A14 in the iPhone 12, but that doesn’t matter at all, since there was no lack of speed already.Even with larger apps such as Garage Band and iMovie, there’s no sign of any delays on the iPhone 13. Every operation is fast and smooth making it effortless to use. Geekbench scores also back up the iPhone 13’s performance, with a 19% increase in the multicore CPU score over the iPhone 12.New iOS 15 features blend in nicely too. Even the Focus modes which can seem a little overwhelming to set up are quickly integrated into your workflow, thanks to the one-off prompts, asking if you want certain notifications in your current focus and offering location-based activations. I can now activate work mode, just by sitting at my desk.The A15 is also more efficient for battery use, and is faster for smart background tasks, such as the processing required for the improved photo quality, or everything that Cinematic Mode is doing.The iPhone 13 now includes better support for worldwide 5G coverage, and remains capable of ridiculously fast download speeds where it’s supported.Here in the US, the iPhone 12 benefits from the faster mmWave 5G, which can deliver data speeds up to 2Gbps. As this band is yet to be utilized outside of the US, iPhones sold in other regions don’t support this bandwidth.T-Mobile has labeled its mmWave 5G as Ultra Capacity and a small UC appears next to your 5G icon when it’s being used. With a full four bars of 5G UC signal here in Chicago, I was able to get download speeds of around 450Mbps and uploads of over 40Mbps. That’s actually faster than my internet provider can give me over Wi-Fi, so it’s really impressive.The biggest performance change is the improved battery life, helped partly by the A15’s efficiency, and partly by a bigger battery unit.Apple rates this iPhone as being able to last for 19 hours of video playback, which is up from 17 hours in the iPhone 12, or 16 in the iPhone 11. Even better is that it says it should manage 15 hours of streamed video, whereas the iPhone 12 could only manage 11, or 10 from the iPhone 11.After a full day of testing with the phone and a night on standby, the phone still had around 40% battery left. For standard use, you could just charge it every other day and still avoid running out of battery.The sum of the iPhone 13’s updates and improvements over the iPhone 12 do add up and the result is a much-improved handset. Just about every element of this phone has had a tweak in one way or another, making it all the better. And that you also get double the amount of storage on the base model and it more than justifies the $100/£100 price difference.Everything the iPhone 13 does, it does well. It’s a solid reliable smartphone with some clever photo and video features that comes in at a price point that is competitive. For those that want the very best, the iPhone 13 Pro range has that under control. For everyone else, the iPhone 13 is the phone to buy.If you’re upgrading from an iPhone that’s several years older, your big choice here might be between the iPhone 13 and iPhone 12. We’ve talked a lot about the comparisons between them, and the iPhone 12 has come down in price, with the iPhone 13 sitting slightly above it. I’d suggest that if you’re the kind who keeps phones for several years, and you can spare the extra cash, it’s worth getting the 13, with all of its extra quality-of-life improvements. But the iPhone 12 is still a very premium phone, and remains a great buy – here’s our full iPhone 12 review.If you’re more the kind who likes to have cutting-edge stuff, then probably the iPhone 13 Pro is the big competition for you. That delivers even more battery life, an additional 3x zoom camera lens, and an even brighter screen that supports 120Hz refresh rates. It’s the most swish and premium option, for a bunch more money. The 13 Pro is better, since it give you more… but I think most people will be happy with what the 13 offers, and a bit of cash saved.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/apple-iphone-13
7,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G review: the best folding phone for most people,"Considering buying a foldable phone? This Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G review is the right place to be - it’s arguably the best folding phone for most people because it’s much more affordable than any other foldable device out there right now.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G was unveiled at the Galaxy Unpacked event in August 2021 alongside Samsung's top-of-the-line folding phone, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G, as well as the Galaxy Watch4 series and the Galaxy Buds 2.Unlike a lot of other attempts to corner the market, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G is a flip phone that looks like it could actually work for the average person. I recently got my hands on one and actually, I think it’s great. It’s sure to be one of the best foldable phones you can buy in 2021.Here I’ll take you through everything I thought about the phone in this Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G review from its design and build right through to the hardware and software.First, watch this video overview where I’ll take you through everything you need to know about both of Samsung’s Galaxy Z 3 series folding phones.You can pick up the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G now with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $999 in the US, £949 in the UK and AU$1,499 in Australia. You can also buy it with 256GB of storage for about $1,049 / £999 / AU$1,599.Although it’s still quite expensive, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G is now the same price as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus so it's much cheaper than other clamshell folding phones like the Motorola Razr. At launch, it was about £350 cheaper than the original Galaxy Z Flip which is sure to make this a much more convincing piece of kit.Most smartphones look more or less identical. They are often samey slabs of glass that don’t really have much to set them apart physically, other than maybe a camera notch here and a curved screen there. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G is definitely not one of those. It looks completely different and I think it’s a really good looking phone.When it’s folded up, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G will fit in the palm of your hand. Unfolded, the phone feels very slender and it looks just like a regular smartphone, so you get the best of both worlds.Naturally, when you fold it up it does feel quite thick. Measuring 72.2 x 86.4 x 17.1 - 15.9mm, it does add some bulk to your pocket but it’ll still be small enough to fit into it in the first place. At 183g, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G weighs the same as a regular smartphone which makes it just as comfortable to use and hold.You can buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G in 7 glossy colours including lavender, cream, black and green to name a few. The coloured phones have a two-tone design where the body meets the cover screen. It looks quite cool, and you’re sure to have people ask “what’s that?” when you pull it out in public.Not only does it look a bit different but it’s actually practical as well. The cover screen has some really handy uses and you get everything you're used to having on your phone from the main screen as well. I’m enjoying seeing a shakeup in the phone world now that Samsung has made it feel more plausible.To unlock the handset, you can choose between the usual pin, pattern and password. There’s also the choice of facial recognition and the fingerprint scanner which is located on the power button. Personally, I found the scanner was placed a little too far up to where my thumb sits which meant I kept missing it. Ultimately that meant that I didn’t manage to unlock my phone every time I went to touch it.One of the biggest changes in this year’s Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G is the build quality. Like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G, this is one of Samsung’s toughest phones yet. It’s made from a durable Armor Aluminium, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus and it has the highest IPX8 rating which means it’ll survive being dunked in water. When I tried it out, the hinge felt firm to open and close and it clicks into place when folded out. The overall build does feel strong and premium as well.On the original Galaxy Z Flip, the cover screen was only 1.1 inches which was just too small. It meant you couldn’t do much on it and it could only display one notification at a time. Now, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G has a screen that is quadruple the size, so it can fit up to 4 notifications on it at once. That’s not all it can do though.You’ll be able to customise what you see on the cover screen by adding widgets that you swipe through to check out the weather, access Samsung Pay, control your music, set your alarms and so much more. It feels surprisingly natural to use, you soon get used to checking your messages from there to save time on opening up the phone.The large 6.7inch Full HD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X display inside has an adaptive refresh rate of 120Hz which makes it feel buttery smooth to scroll and swipe on. Mobile games feel slick and browsing the web feels effortless.As you would expect from Samsung, the screen looks seriously crisp with bright colours, although because it is so long video doesn’t fit neatly onto it horizontally instead leaving you with two black strips on either side of the content. In saying that, for reading articles or shopping, that extra length is really useful.The crease on the screen doesn’t dramatically change the experience of using the main display. That’s not to say you can’t see it at all though because when the screen is white, tilted or when light reflects off it, it becomes very obvious and can sometimes warp images a little. One other problem was that the screen wasn’t always completely responsive near the crease and sometimes missed my tap, this wasn’t a major problem though.Running on Android 11 with Samsung's One UI, the overall experience when the main screen is folded out flat is just as you’d expect from a Samsung phone. It’s intuitive, user friendly and there’s easy access to Google’s suite of apps. There have been a few software upgrades this time around to suit the folding nature of the phone.When the phone is partially folded, the Flex Panel shifts your app content to the top half and places settings like the volume on the bottom half. I tried it out across a few different apps and it’s especially useful for streaming video. For instance, you can watch a video from YouTube on the top half and adjust the volume or switch on subtitles below. You can also split the screen and have multiple windows open at once, like if you wanted to continue watching the video while you do a bit of online shopping.The phone is powered by the most recent Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 CPU which means it should be faster than the original Z Flip which had a 7nm chip. In use, larger apps like games seemed to load very quickly and I didn’t notice any lag in mobile games although it did sometimes heat up a little when you’ve got it hard at work.On Geekbench 5, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G scored 1,103 in single-core and 3,494 in multi-core which is just as good as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. Finally, a flip phone that you can rely on for speed and efficiency. Not only is it fast but this phone is future-proofed as well with 5G connectivity so you’ll get the fastest internet speeds possible if you live in an area that supports it.The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G has a 3,300mAh battery inside, that's a lot smaller than most smartphones I see but it still managed to last the majority of the day before it needed to be charged again. I ran a video on it over two hours on full brightness and in that time, the battery level dropped by 14% which suggests the phone would have lasted over 14 hours in total. While that’s not the best battery life there is, it is pretty good.Recharging the phone again from empty to 100% took just over an hour which is good going as well, although it's worth knowing that there's no adaptor in the box, you just get the cable.Full disclosure, the camera tech isn’t the most impressive you’ll see on a smartphone at this price. In fact, it’s far from the quality you'd get from the best phones you can buy. There’s a 10MP hole punch style camera on the main screen and on the back there’s a 12MP wide-angle camera as well as a 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens.All in all the camera was quite hit and miss depending on the point of focus and the lighting conditions. It’s not just as easy as snapping the shot. Some of my point-and-shoot photos using the rear cameras came out looking great, while others, even on the sunniest day came out lacking sharpness and without much in the way of detail. At times, it struggled to balance contrasting areas of the shot as well. Similarly, colours looked vibrant and accurate for the most part, but without the right lighting, they could look dulled out at times.While the camera system is unlikely to blow you away, there are a few really useful features you should know about. Firstly, Flex Panel works here as well. With the screen partially folded you can have the preview placed on the top panel with the camera settings on the bottom, which means you can keep the camera steady while adjusting the settings and switching between the different modes.You can also change where everything sits on the screen, like if you wanted the settings on the top half and the preview on the bottom half. If you want to see everything in more detail the Capture View can take up the whole screen as well.The other cool camera feature to highlight is that you can actually take shots without unfolding the phone at all, you just double press the power key. Although the screen will be too small to see much on, it’ll still be great for snapping quick selfies on the go. You won’t ever miss a photo opportunity again.While the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G won’t be for everyone, this is a device that proves folding phones can actually work for the masses - I really like it and would actually buy it as my next phone.Samsung has done a really great job at making this accessible and convenient. They’ve managed to combine style and standout features with well thought out software, and it all comes under a price tag that doesn’t make your eyes water so much.The one major downside is the simplicity of the camera system because at this sort of price you would expect the camera to be seriously accomplished as opposed to just quite good, folding phone or not. Despite that, I would still consider buying this phone myself because frankly, it’s a pretty cool piece of kit.As far as clamshell-style folding phones go, you literally won’t find a phone better than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G. There are other options to consider, of course, like the Motorola Razr but it is very pricey and not quite as effective. The cameras, chipset, and battery life aren’t quite at the same level as you get here.If you want a larger phablet display then Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is the one really worth buying but you could also consider the Huawei Mate Xs which has a foldable display on the outside as opposed to on the inside to reveal an 8inch OLED screen.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-5g-review

5G: YesThis Xiaomi 11T Pro review in a nutshell: What you get here is a handset that easily competes with the best Android phones - it has plenty of power, a decent camera and a big battery as well as super-fast charging. Despite that, there isn't anything about it that will really make you go ""wow"".Xiaomi has taken some leaps in the phone world this year, in fact, it’s now ahead of Apple in terms of market share and it sits just behind Samsung at the very top.Now Xiaomi is looking for its next smartphone success story, the Chinese company recently launched their new T series of smartphones and included in that was the Xiaomi 11T Pro. It offers high-end specs at a mid-range price, even though it does sit towards the pricier end of that.So how does it stack up against the very best phones you can buy? Long story short, it’s not anything special but it is a great phone for those who want speed and fantastic battery life. Find out more in this Xiaomi 11T Pro review where I'll cover everything you need to know about this smartphone.Unlike previous generations, Xiaomi has done away with the Mi branding, naming it simply the Xiaomi 11T series. It's made up of the Xiaomi 11T which is one of the best cheap phones this year, as well as this phone, the Xiaomi 11T Pro which is a step above in terms of specs and it has a  higher price tag to match.So how are they different? Well for starters, the Xiaomi 11T Pro boasts a more powerful chipset, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 as opposed to the 11T’s MediaTek Dimensity 1200-Ultra. You won’t get Xiaomi HyperCharge with the cheaper phone either as the 11T only offers 67W charging as opposed to the Xiaomi 11T Pro’s 120W, although they do both have a 5,000mAh battery.Both handsets have Full HD+ 6.67inch displays with a 120Hz refresh rate. You'll find similar cameras as well although you do get the benefit of 8K video from the Xiaomi 11T Pro which you don’t get with the 11T. Another benefit of the pricier piece of kit is the fact that the sound is produced by Harmon Kardon so you’ll be better off watching videos or playing music on that phone.Available to pre-order from the 24th September in the UK, the Xiaomi Mi 11T Pro will set you back £599 for the phone with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, you’re looking at paying £699. We expect the phone will be available in Australia as well later this year, it's unlikely to be sold in the US.You can buy the Xiaomi 11T Pro in a few different colours: Celestial Blue, Meteorite Grey or Moonlight White. I saw the Grey version which has a shiny brushed metal finish on the back, it looks pretty smart although the mirrored effect does mean that you get fingerprint marks on the back of the phone almost every time you touch it. If that's likely to annoy you, a case will solve that problem and luckily there's one included in the box.In picking up the Xiaomi 11T Pro for the first time, I was struck by its size. This is a chunky phone weighing 204g and measuring 164.1 x 76.9 x 8.8mm. It doesn’t feel as slim and compact as others which is a problem for me as I have small hands. Another design niggle is the camera notch which sticks out a fair amount making it annoying to use flat on a table, and it catches when you slide it into a tight pocket.On the front, it has the usual hole-punch style camera in the middle at the top, while the screen is framed by a slim black bezel (although I have seen slimmer). To unlock the display, there’s a side-mounted fingerprint scanner on the power button which works well and is well-placed for where your thumb naturally sits on the frame. You do get the choice to use facial recognition as well. Wired headphone users should upgrade to Bluetooth buds if they’re keen to buy this phone as there’s no 3.5mm headphone jack here.The large 6.67inch FHD+ display has a resolution of 2400x1080p and 1000 nits peak brightness. While that’s nothing special on a phone at this price, it is definitely good enough and combined with the HDR10+ support makes this phone fantastic for streaming video.It's seriously smooth to use as well, thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate, every scroll and swipe feels effortless. You’ll be able to really make the most of that in mobile games, and everything else from scrolling the web to tapping through online shops will feel just as satisfying. The previous generation of the phone, the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro actually had an even higher refresh rate but, to be honest, the fact that Xiaomi has downgraded this time around doesn’t really make that much difference.The rear camera system is made up of a 108MP wide-angle camera, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera and a 5MP telemacro camera. For selfies, there’s a 16MP front camera.All in all, the camera system is very good. You get bright, colourful shots with a good balance between light and dark areas. When you zoom into the photo you'll see it doesn't pick up quite as much detail as you’d get elsewhere. It hardly compares to phones like the iPhone 12 Pro, however considering the Xiaomi 11T Pro is a fraction of the price, you can still manage to get some really nice snaps.The camera performed best at landscapes and cityscapes but doesn't fare quite as well when it comes to macro shots up close to the subject where the intricate detail of the photo is most important.Unlike the other phone in the T series, you can film video in resolutions up to 8K here. It looks good in comparison to the video you can take on other smartphones at this price, you’ll be able to rely on it to take clear video without graininess although it was a little shaky even when I filmed sat down to reduce camera shake.Under the hood, you’ll find the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor which is paired with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, if you’re looking to spend less then you could opt for 128GB of storage instead. It’s worth bearing in mind that there’s no Micro SD card slot to expand the memory capacity though.All that processing power means that this phone is fast and efficient to use, it’ll cope with mobile games and you’ll easily be able to get work done on it as well with loads of different apps open at once. You won’t get quite the level of speed as you do from the most premium flagship devices but it performs similarly to phones like the OnePlus 9 or the Oppo Find X3 Pro. On Geekbench 5, it scored 1,044 in single-core and 3,595 in multi-core which is definitely up there with the better performing handsets.Alongside speedy overall performance, this phone has both 5G and Wi-Fi 6 so you’ll be able to make the most out of the quickest internet speeds as well. That's if you live somewhere that supports it and you have a compatible broadband router, of course.Packing a 5,000mAh battery, the Xiaomi 11T Pro seemed to last ages, I used it on and off for a whole workday and managed to get home with some battery left over. To test it out more accurately, I played a video on full brightness over two hours and noted down how much the battery level dropped. In that time the battery went down by 12% which suggests that it would have lasted almost 17 hours in total which is huge!Thanks to the 120W charger included in the box, the phone took around half an hour to recharge from empty to 100% - you'll never be left without time to give your phone a quick charge again.The Xiaomi 11T Pro uses the MIUI 12.5 operating system which is based on Android 11. It’s colourful, bright and simple although admittedly the icons are a little childlike. Starting it up for the first time, there are a few apps pre-installed that you might feel compelled to delete like AliExpress or WPS Office, yet in saying that you do also get your Google apps ready to go which is very useful. This OS does include a few handy extra features as well, like Raise to Wake and an Always-On function which will show you the date, time, battery and your notifications.Harmon Kardon tuned the dual speakers on the Xiaomi 11T Pro, and it has Dolby Atmos, so a major plus point here is the quality of the audio. Loud, clear and accurate you’ll easily get away with watching TV shows and movies on this phone although naturally, you’ll want to hook up a separate speaker or headphones if you want to listen to music as you do still get slightly distorted sound at the highest levels.The Xiaomi 11T Pro is a phone for those who care about having a speedy handset with a huge screen, and a battery that will last a full day and then some. You even get a decent three-lens camera system that can take some great shots, and seriously fast charging as well.All of those perks combined make this a great phone for commuters and business users in particular. I wouldn’t recommend this for anyone with small hands or who want a slim, compact phone because it is very hard to use one-handed, but it’ll be a good choice for just about anyone else.If it’s a big screen you’re after, the OnePlus 9 Pro is the best premium Android phone you can buy right now. It has a 6.7inch QHD+ display that will absolutely knock your socks off, it’s stunning. That’s packed into a device with a fantastic camera and a stylish design, but it is a little bit more expensive than the Xiaomi 11T Pro.On a smaller budget? The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is the perfect phone for photography and it costs a fraction of the price of the Xiaomi 11T Pro. Despite its price, it still manages to pack in a 120Hz FHD+ display, water-resistance and a long-lasting 4,500mAh battery - although the performance isn’t quite going to compare.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-11t-pro
9,Xiaomi 11T,Xiaomi 11T review: an image-focused performer,"The latest Xiaomi phone launch delivered three new models to the range, including the Xiaomi 11T. The T designation usually provides a slightly downscaled or mid-range version of the phone, but this can sometime mean that you can get a product that’s almost as good as the flagship for less cash. That seems to be the case with the Xiaomi 11T. While there are some notable changes from the Mi 11 – including now losing the Mi in the name on all models – this is still an impressive phone, making it a contender for our best cheap smartphone list.Instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, the Xiaomi 11T uses a MediaTek 1200-Ultra chip. It still offers a three-camera array on the rear, including a 108MP main lens, though the ultra-wide and front camera are low resolution. The screen is also smaller and less resolute but is still an AMOLED with 120Hz refresh rate.The question here is not whether this model is better, but whether you really notice the differences and if they are worth the difference in price.The Xiaomi 11T, along with the Xiaomi 11T Pro and Xiaomi 11T Lite were launched on September 15, 2021. The phone is priced £499 in the UK for the 8GB RAM model with 128GB storage and £549 for the 256GB version. The phone is not officially available in the US but, like previous models, will be made available through importers. I suspect the price will sit around the $500 mark when it appears.The under-screen fingerprint sensor drew some criticism in the Mi 11, so I imagine many users will be happy that this has returned to a button – as it was in the Mi 10T. However, this function can sometimes be too good. I found a few times that I accidentally unlocked the phone again while putting it in my pocket (as I gripped around the button), which caused a range of searches and almost posted a few Tweets. In time I’m sure I’d learn to move my index finger but it’s a learning process – and one of the occasions when I really missed Face ID.The front display lacks the curved screen of the Mi 11, instead offering a flat 6.67-inch AMOLED display. This has an FHD+ (2400x1080) resolution, which is significantly lower than the 3200x1440 on the Mi 11. At 800 nits standard, or 1000 nits peak, it’s also not quite as bright. The plus side here is that it still has a 120Hz refresh rate and adaptive sync (though only between 60Hz and 120Hz).The screen also offers an always on function that can display the date, time, battery life and show notification icons. This is really handy as it avoids having to press a button to check the time or what has caused the latest ding or vibrate.The rear of the phone is much more familiar. It retains the curved design and comes in a choice of three colors: Meteorite Gray, Moonlight White and Celestial Blue. The model I received was the Meteorite Gray, which has a shiny finish that you can see you face in (should you wish to take a selfie this way). The downside is that it shows up fingerprints and smudges easily. It also tends to slide off any surface that isn’t completely flat. I’ve watched the phone slowly slide off my notepad multiple times.The camera array is now in a longer form, with the three lenses stacked vertically, while the sensors and LED flash sit to their right. There’s still a significant bump here, though no more than on, say, the iPhone 12 Pro. The bump is two-stage though – with a small rise for the whole array and a second rise for the main camera lens area.The supplied see-through rubber case solves the sliding issue and minimizes how much the camera bump stands out, but it also makes the phone feel much bulkier, and I preferred its handling without the case.The curved back panel helps make the Xiaomi 11T feel smaller than it is, and its balance makes it pretty easy to operate with one hand. This is impressive for a phone with such a large screen. My hand naturally landed on the power on button, which thanks to the in-built fingerprint sensor in the button, automatically unlocked the device.Well controlled HDR in affectThe front facing camera has been centered on the Xiaomi 11T and sits as a rather large punch hole in the display. As this sits among the array of notifications, signal bars and battery life though, when the screen is on you soon forget it’s there. This camera is a 16MP unit with an f/2.45 aperture – another step down from the 20MP f/2.2 model on the Mi 11.The images look nice enough, though the wide-angle nature of the lens does give some distortion, especially in the vertical direction at close range. With an arm fully stretched this isn’t an issue.Though the rear cameras have also seen a downgrade, the important features are still here – namely the 108MP main camera and the 2x tele macro. The 108MP main camera uses a 9-in-1 pixel arrangement to create a 12MP image (3000 x 4000 pixels) for general use but by selecting the 108MP mode, it will retain the full 9000 x 12000-pixel image. This can be a useful feature if you need to crop in but on most occasions, you are better using it in the 12MP mode, not least because the image will look better, with less haloing and compression visible.The 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens gives a handy 120-degree field of view for those big landscapes, group shots or, in my case, attempts to capture the whole of Wrigley Field in one image. There’s a little distortion at the edges but nothing severe.The third camera is the same 5MP telemacro as featured on the Mi 11. It provides a 2x magnification and focuses down to 1.18 inches (3cm). The results are impressive at this distance, allowing you to get creative – though you do need lots of light, otherwise the images can get very noisy. I used this camera to scan in a negative on a light box and it worked pretty well.There are a wide range of features in the camera app to help you create better photos and video. I really like the Pro setting, which lets you manually set everything, from the white balance to the focus. A ‘More’ option reveals options such as night mode, time lapse, panorama and video functions such as VLOG, dual video and a bunch of movie effects, that include magic zoom and time freeze. Some of these options must be downloaded before use but offer both useful and fun creative options. The night mode does a great job at brightening a scene and while some options feel a bit cheesy, there’s a lot to work with.There’s no 8K video option on the Xiaomi 11T but it will shoot in 4K at 30fps or 1080P at 60fps. Plus, if you choose the slow-motion option, you can do up to 960fps in 720P.One nice improvement on the Xiaomi 11T is the battery. This is a 5000mAh unit (rather than a 4600mAh) so it lasts longer. I found that with regular use it could last up to two days, and if you turn on some of the battery saver functions in the menu, it can be much longer still. Though not as long as it claims – with just 4% left and less than an hour before it was due to die, I turned on the battery saver that promised another 18 hours. The battery was out in less than five.Thanks to the 65W charger that comes in the box, it charges quicker too. Even using a travel adaptor to plug the supplied euro-style plug into a 110V US socket, I went from zero to 100% in less than 35 minutes. It’s a simple thing but the graphics while it’s charging look pretty cool too, with a stream of electricity shown coming from the charging point to the percentage charged value on the display.Perhaps the most interesting feature of the Xiaomi 11T is the MediaTek processor. It’s the only one of the three new 11T models to use MediaTek as opposed to Qualcomm Snapdragon processors (the 11T Pro uses the Snapdragon 888 while the 11T Lite uses the 778G).The MediaTek Dimensity 1200 is a 5G chip that offers eight cores and up to 3GHz clock speeds. It lacks the Snapdragon 888’s ability to support 8K video and higher refresh rates on QHD displays, which is why the resolution is lower and 8k video is missing here. It’s also slower more battery intensive, hence the larger battery.In addition to 5G, the Xiaomi 11T also offers Bluetooth 5.2 and Wi-Fi 6 connections. There’s NFC and an IR beam for remote functions and a dual SIM slot to allow for two lines (in some regions).In use, the Xiaomi 11T feels nippy without any signs of lag. There are still some issues here associated with the MIUI skin that runs on top of Android, but MIUI 12.5 is definitely an improvement and allows you to uninstall and disable those Mi apps that you don’t want to use.Though it’s not quite the phone that the Mi 11 is, the Xiaomi 11T is a great performing device that is more than enough for most users. It also includes a couple of really nice features that elevate it from your standard mid-priced smartphone – namely the camera array and fast charge.You really can create some nice images and video with ease on this phone, and there’s tons of options to play with. Also, knowing that you can charge it up in such a short time really gets rid of that battery anxiety.If you want top performance the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra provides that but if you need a phone that is reliable and offers some creative abilities, the Xiaomi 11T is well worth considering.Perhaps the Xiaomi 11T’s biggest competitors are the other Xiaomi models. Right now, the slight superior Mi 11 is discounted to £599 – just £100 more than the 11T, which for the added features is probably worth it.The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE also comes in for a similar price to the 11T. This offers a comparible display, with 120Hz refresh and a solid triple camera array on the rear. It alos uses the Snapdragon 865 processor.Following the launch of Apple’s new iPhone 13, the iPhone 11 is now selling for under £500, or if you’re happy with a smaller screen, the iPhone 12 mini is just £579. Side by side on specs, neither of these devices can stand up to the Xiaomi 11T, but they are great phones in their own right with excellent camera systems.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-11t-review-an-image-focused-performer
10,Motorola Edge 20 Pro,Motorola Edge 20 Pro review: a phone on the edge of interesting,"This Motorola Edge 20 Pro review could be a good place to start if you're on the hunt for a phone that comes at a more palatable price than the most premium flagships. Some of the best phones you can buy sit within the mid-range market, and this one doesn't look out of place.While it won’t be topping T3’s guide to the best Android phones you can buy, it does deserve a spot there. Motorola has pulled out all the stops with this one - packing a high-end chipset, a high-quality display and fantastic battery life - but admittedly there's nothing that makes it really stand out against the crowd.Originally named the Edge because of the 'endless edge' on its curved screen, Motorola surprisingly did away with that this time around, opting for a flat display instead. I couldn’t tell you what the thinking behind that was. Anyway, let's get to it. Here's the full Motorola Edge 20 Pro review.Launched back at the end of July, the Motorola Edge 20 Pro is available to buy now and will set you back £649.99 in the UK and AU$899 in Australia - it’s Motorola’s flagship device for 2021.It’s not yet on sale in America but we expect to see the phone hit the shelves later in the year. Take a look at the widgets on this page to see the most recent prices from across the web.Alongside the Motorola Edge 20 Pro, two other phones were announced: the cheaper mid-range Motorola Edge 20 and the even more affordable Motorola Edge 20 Lite. While all three have large 6.7inch screens, 5G and Wi-Fi 6 - if you want the best performance, design and camera system then stick to the Motorola Edge 20 Pro.If you only really care about the screen and you’re willing to make some sacrifices elsewhere then the Motorola Edge 20 actually features the same 144Hz HDR10+ OLED display as the Pro version of the phone.The camera system is largely the same as well, there is one lens that is different though. On the Edge 20, you don't get the Pro’s periscope telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. Instead, it has a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. There's also a smaller battery in the cheaper model of the phone, and a more basic chipset.Straight out of the box, you can tell the Motorola Edge 20 Pro sits at the top of their range of smartphones. Available in Midnight Blue or Blue Vegan Leather, it’s got an air of class to it that most Motorola phones lack. I got my hands on the Midnight Blue version which has a matte reflective finish.Weighing just 190g it’s very light but it measures 163 x 76 x 7.99 mm which is massive - that makes it a little tricky to use one-handed, especially with hands as small as mine.Both the front and back are made with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 so while it’s going to be a relatively sturdy phone, it’s not the toughest you can get. Unlike other recent flagship phones, the Motorola Edge 20 Pro is only IP52 which means it isn’t fully waterproof either. You’ll have to be careful not to have any accidents with this handset.The back of the phone features a three-lens camera module, it does stick out a fair amount so it won't sit flat on the table and it’s actually a little bit annoying to use if you’re not holding it.The power button on the frame doubles up as a fingerprint sensor to unlock the display. It generally worked well but it was placed too far up the phone to where your thumb naturally sits which meant I kept missing it. If that starts to drive you up the wall you do get the choice to use facial recognition to unlock the phone as well.Above the fingerprint scanner, there are two volume controls and on the opposite edge is a tiny dedicated Google Assistant button which is a pretty handy little feature to have. There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack here though so if you’re still using wired headphones, it’s time to upgrade.The edge to edge 6.7inch OLED display looks excellent, it's only interrupted by the discreet hole punch style camera. With FHD+ resolution of 2400 x 1080p, the screen is sharp, bright and colourful. Because it has a refresh rate of 144Hz, scrolling and swiping through the user interface feels silky smooth and flicking through web pages is just as satisfying, yet it's mobile games that benefit the most, everything is just so fluid and slick. I'm not entirely sure why Motorola went above and beyond with 144Hz over the usual 120Hz but I can't deny it feels fantastic.Watching video was a pleasure as well thanks to the HDR10+ support which enhances the colour and contrast to boost your overall viewing experience. All in all the display is one of the best I’ve ever seen on a Motorola phone and I don’t actually have anything bad to say about it.Motorola claims that this is their most powerful camera system yet. It's made up of a 108MP main camera, a 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens and an 8MP 5x telephoto lens, as well as a 32MP selfie snapper on the front.Even on a gloomy day, the camera system did quite a good job at picking up plenty of detail although admittedly it did struggle to boost darker areas of the shot, and sometimes colours came out looking pretty bland.  This wasn't so much of an issue on a sunny day though.Point-and-shoot photos looked alright on the whole. But when it came to macro shots up close, they fell a little flat. In low light, you can't expect to take impressive shots either. When I took some Night Vision photos, they all came out lacking sharpness.The high-res optical zoom produces usable, clear shots at 5x zoom and it can go right up to a 50x Super Zoom. While you might use up to 10x zoom, I'm not sure I see the point in the 50x zoom even if it does show you more than the human eye can see. The shots come out too grainy to use for anything.Under the hood, the Motorola Edge 20 Pro packs in the high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 chipset - it’s not the absolute best Qualcomm CPU out there but it’s still very good going. Paired with 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage it's sure to do well. There's plenty of space for apps and files, but if you need more then there is a MicroSD card slot to expand it.I had tonnes of apps open at once and the Motorola Edge 20 Pro took it all in its stride. There are faster phones out there yet this is certainly up there with some of the top dogs. You’ll definitely get away with using this for gaming as well.To test out the phone's performance more quantitatively I used Geekbench 5’s benchmark test, the Motorola Edge 20 Pro managed to score 973 in single-core and 3,116 in multi-core. That’s not far off other similarly priced handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G and it’s actually better than some much more pricey phones including the Oppo Find X3 Pro. Motorola has pulled it out of the bag with this one.With both 5G and Wi-Fi 6 support, you're guaranteed the fastest internet speeds if your area and broadband router allow for it. If not, then at least you're set up for the future.Powering the phone is a 4,500mAh battery, it lasted the whole day and then some. In fact, it still had juice left at the end of the day. I watched videos, scrolled through social media and played a game here and there. When I ran a video on full brightness over the space of two hours, the battery level dropped by 12% which suggests it would have lasted almost 17 hours of playback in total. That’s comparable to some of the most expensive flagship phones you can buy.In the box, the phone comes with a 30W charger which only took about an hour and 15 minutes to charge the phone from empty to 100%. Unlike with more expensive handsets, there’s no wireless charging here, unfortunately.Android 11 is the brains of the operation and Motorola’s version of it is one of the best there is. Clearly laid out with easy access to Google’s suite of apps, it looks smart and simple without being overly colourful or childish. What’s more, is that the handy gesture controls make the phone even more efficient to use. You can twist your wrist twice to open the camera, touch the screen with three fingers to take a screenshot or to enable Do Not Disturb just flip the phone over - these can all be switched on or off according to what you want and need.The Motorola Edge 20 Pro is compatible with Motorola’s Ready For technology which lets you project the phone’s display onto a PC or desktop. It comes with the Ready For cable included in the box, although you can do it wirelessly as well. You’ll even be able to hook up a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard to it. In everyday terms, that means you can check your emails, edit documents, display photos or watch videos on a much bigger screen. I’m not sure it’ll replace a laptop but it's still another handy feature worth knowing about.The Motorola Edge 20 Pro might be Motorola’s flagship handset for 2021 but it doesn’t have all of the bells and whistles you can get elsewhere.Despite that, the fast performance and long-lasting battery do make it a pretty convincing piece of kit. Plus if you’re someone who enjoys playing mobile games, then the massive display and 144Hz refresh rate are sure to make it an enjoyable experience.I wouldn’t say that this is by any means the perfect mid-range phone, and it’s definitely towards the pricier end of mid-range, but the Motorola Edge 20 Pro pleasantly surprised me with how well it performs across the board.For a similar price, you can get your hands on a much more stylish phone like the OnePlus 9. Not only does it look the part but it plays the part too, it performed ever-so-slightly better than the Motorola Edge 20 Pro. It’s a lovely combination of speed and beauty.As things stand, the best phone for most people is still the iPhone 12, it costs just a little bit more than the Motorola Edge 20 Pro but packs in loads of power and it has a really fantastic camera system. The screen is only 60Hz though, something to bear in mind if you play a lot of mobile games.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/motorola-edge-20-pro-review
11,OnePlus Nord,OnePlus Nord review: the ultimate mid-ranger,"From the get-go, I can tell you that this OnePlus Nord review is a love letter to the mid-range phone. Times are changing and you really don't need to spend loads of cash on a high-end flagship smartphone. Screens, chipsets and camera lenses are getting cheaper which ultimately means the mid-range market is able to thrive.At the end of the day, what's the point in spending over the odds on one of the very best smartphones if they're only just faster and take only slightly better photos than something that costs half the price? Even Apple has a mid-range handset now in the form of the iPhone SE 2020.The recent release of the OnePlus Nord 2 means the original Nord is now cheaper than it's ever been before. The newer generation switches up the camera, puts some extra force behind its processor and has packed in a better battery - so what is it that you care more about, value or performance?And, while the OnePlus flagships like the OnePlus 8 Pro or the more recent OnePlus 9 Pro are still their crowning glory, branching out into the competitive world of mid-range smartphones is a no-brainer for the brand, joining Google, Apple and Samsung in the segment that's now busier than ever.Our comprehensive OnePlus Nord review should all of the burning questions you have about the handset – how it performs in daily use, what kind of quality photos you can expect from it, how it feels in the hand, how long the battery lasts, and importantly how it stacks up against some of the best Android phones.Anyone thinking of buying the OnePlus Nord in 2021 will find this review helpful, it should hopefully make that choice easier. If you're looking to spend even less on a phone, they've just released an even cheaper model, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G which is definitely worth considering as well.The OnePlus Nord has also won the Best Value Phone award at the T3 Awards 2021, so if you're considering it then be sure to read up on why the judges thought it was so good. Later this year we're expecting to see the OnePlus Nord 2 make an appearance so watch this space, there could be a new champion on the horizon.With a mid-range phone like this, the question is where to cut the corners to save on price, but the OnePlus Nord definitely isn't holding back when it comes to the screen. The 6.44-inch, 1080 x 2400 pixel AMOLED display on show here is superb to look at and use – bright, clear, and thanks to its 90Hz refresh rate, very fluid in everything that it does.OnePlus says it's worked on a host of tweaks and optimizations in the background to ensure a quality visual experience, and that's exactly what you get whether you're flicking through photos, websites, or Netflix episodes. You can also customise the display in a host of ways, with night and reading modes available, plus a colour temperature setting.As far as design goes, we're impressed with what OnePlus has done here as well. Besides the screen it's a premium-feeling phone, lightweight and thin, with a plain but stylish aesthetic. There's a bright Blue Marble colour, which is the one we tested, as well as a more muted Grey Onyx option, but they both score highly in terms of their look and feel – and a mention too for the traditional OnePlus mute switch that's on the side of the phone, a feature we wish that more manufacturers would decide to adopt.Only if you held this up next to a £1,000 smartphone and looked closely would you be able to spot any differences in the style or build quality. What you don't get is IP68 waterproofing (though a few light splashes and rain showers should be fine), or a headphone jack – it's the USB-C port or wireless for headphones. There's a fingerprint sensor built into the display, which works better than most we've tried in the past.Cameras are another area where mid-range phones have really caught up in recent years. The quad-lens 48MP+8MP+2MP+5MP on the back of the Nord does a fine job in most conditions, and can usually get decent shots in the dark too – though the night mode that OnePlus calls Nightscape tends to make for some rather weird brightening effects, even if it means that certain parts of the image become more visible.Details are well captured, even in lighter and darker areas, colours are well balanced, and shutter speed is fast too – we'd have no qualms about using the OnePlus Nord as our everyday camera. The ultrawide lens is helpful for fitting more in a scene, and you get an ultrawide mode around the front as well, with the 32MP+8MP front-facing selfie cam (OnePlus says this should put an end to the selfie stick, but we're not so sure).Admittedly photo quality isn't quite up to the very best phones on the market at the moment, especially at night, though it's closer than you might think. This is one area where it's still worth investing some extra money on a flagship if you want the very best pictures and video – there's no telephoto lens here either, so no optical zoom. For social media and casual use though, the OnePlus Nord can more than hold its own.As always, it's difficult to be definitive about battery life on a review unit, as our time with them is short and brand new batteries always perform well. With intermittent, occasional use – less than you would normally use a phone in 24 hours – we were seeing drops of around 40 percent per day in the level of the 4,115mAh battery. Two hours of video streaming, meanwhile, knocked the battery down from 100 percent to 78 percent. That suggests you'll have plenty left in the tank at the end of each day with the OnePlus Nord, and that it'll last for 10 solid hours of movie watching.The Snapdragon 765G processor from Qualcomm is running the show here – not quite the best chipset inside an Android phone this year (that'll be the Snapdragon 865), but close enough for most people. We found performance speedy and responsive all round, from jumping between apps to jumping between browser tabs, and the only difference you might find compared to the Snapdragon 865 is an extra second or two on loading screens.In general use we had no issues at all: streaming video, playing demanding games, editing photos... the OnePlus Nord handles it all with aplomb. With the entry-level £379 model you get 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which again should be more than enough for the majority of users, and if your budget can stretch to £469 then you can get hold of the model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.You're getting some very decent specs here for your money, and there's 5G on board too, which is just about becoming standard as we move through 2020. The Geekbench scores of 605 (single-core) and 1894 (multi-core) show you are taking a hit in the performance department compared with the very best phones on the market, but in day-to-day use we don't think you're going to have any complaints.OnePlus OxygenOS is on board, running on top of Android 10, and it's been one of our favourite Android variants for a while now. The visuals are eye-catching without being showy, the additional settings (like lock screen customisations) are thoughtfully done, and bloatware is kept to a minimum (all the traditional Google apps are present and correct).How has OnePlus got the price of the Nord so low? There are compromises here, they're just not that easy to spot. The OnePlus 8 (starting price £599), for example, has a (slightly) faster processor and a (slightly) bigger screen than the Nord, and its display supports HDR10+ playback, so your movies and shows will look a little better. The OnePlus 8 also has Wi-Fi 6, two speakers rather than one, and a bigger battery, though the Nord beats it in terms of camera sensors on the front and back.None of these are dealbreakers for most people, but it shows the sort of subtle tweaks that OnePlus has made with the Nord to get it to a more affordable level. We'd say the OnePlus Nord is the better value for money phone, and in the bang for buck department it would rank higher than most of the handsets we've come across in the last couple of years. Yes, better screens and better cameras are out there on the smartphone scene, but you'll have to pay a lot more money to get them.As we've said, there are a lot of phones in this price bracket now, but we're struggling to think of one that we'd recommend ahead of the OnePlus Nord for £379 (8GB/128GB) or £469 (12GB/256GB) . Maybe that will change with the arrival of the Pixel 4a from Google, but for now, the combination of features, power and style that OnePlus has put together here is a definite winner.Don't let our five-star rating trick you into thinking that this is a flawless phone – you can find handsets with better cameras and faster processors and waterproofing – but for the money you spend this is a really impressive combination of hardware and software. The mid-range continues to be the most compelling part of the smartphone market, and that has to be good news for anyone wanting to buy a phone that won't break the bank.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-nord
12,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G review: the most convincing folding phone yet,"To sum up this Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G review: without a doubt, this is the best foldable phone to date, and it finally looks like a device you would plausibly consider buying.At Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked event in August 2021 two brand new Galaxy phones were unveiled, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G and the more affordable Z Flip 3.I managed to get my hands on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G. Straight off the bat, it was clear that the smartphone heavyweight is getting closer to making folding phones less of a gimmick and more serious contenders for the best phones you can buy, especially when it comes to gaming and productivity.In this Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G review, I’ll cover everything you need to know about the phone from its design and build, to its two displays and how well it performs against other smartphones. You can also find out about the camera system as well as all of the updated software Samsung has packed into its high-end folding phone.Let’s kick things off with a video overview covering what the 2021 Galaxy Z series has to offer.One factor that makes the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G more convincing than ever is its price tag. You can buy it with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $1,799 in the US, £1,599 in the UK or AU$2,499 in Australia. For the handset with 512GB of storage, you'll be looking at spending about $1,899 / £1,699 / AU$2,649. It goes on sale in the US and the UK from the 27th August 2021, and the 10th September in Australia. Reserve your new phone from Samsung Unpacked hereIt's about $200 / £200 cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 was at launch which makes it more accessible from the word go. Granted, this phone is still going to be far too expensive for most people, but those who can afford it will get more for their money than they would have done from the previous model.After the launch of the original Galaxy Z Fold, a lot of people had problems with the phone being flimsy and fragile. That’s something Samsung has been on a mission to fix ever since. Unfortunately for them, it’s a flaw that the public hasn't forgotten about. Samsung has tried to change that perception by making this their toughest folding phone yet.The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is made from Armor Aluminium which Samsung claims is 10% more durable than the materials used in the Fold 2. The switch-up in materials also means it’s now about 10g lighter than before. Don’t let that fool you though, it still feels significantly heavier than a standard smartphone. It measures 67.1 x 158.2 x 16 - 14.4mm so expect it to add a significant amount of bulk to your pocket.Along with the aluminium chassis, Samsung has covered both the front and back with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus while the screen is more scratch-resistant and supposedly 80% more durable than before. Samsung seems to have achieved its goal because the phone does feel sturdier with a firm hinge and a premium build.Another big change is the new IPX8 rating which means the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is now completely waterproof, you can chuck it in the bath and you won’t have killed it - hurrah!To unlock the handset, there's a fingerprint sensor on the power button. I found it worked quickly and efficiently. In the age of facemasks, it makes much more sense than using facial recognition. As you’d expect from a modern smartphone, there’s no 3.5mm audio input here so if you still use wired headphones you’ll have to switch to a pair that use Bluetooth instead.Overall the phone looks very smart, it's got a sleek matte coating and comes in three sophisticated colours: Phantom Black, Phantom Green and Phantom Silver. For the most part, it stays clean although it does pick up some faint fingerprint marks. The rounded camera module on the back is a welcome change from the rectangular notch that was there before as well.The design won’t appeal to those who want something slim and compact for their pocket but if you want something sturdy that you can keep in your bag without being worried about knocks and bumps then it’ll be well suited.The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G has a 6.2inch cover display and a 7.6inch phablet screen on the inside. The Dynamic AMOLED 2X displays are not only brighter than before but they also conserve more battery life.Like you'd expect from a high-end Samsung device, both screens are crisp and clear with vibrant, accurate colours. The large main screen is great for watching videos and playing mobile games. One problem I did find was that the main screen is very glossy. Because of that, it was reflective which could be distracting and difficult to use in bright sunlight.Both screens support a 120Hz refresh rate, where before the cover screen could only reach 60Hz. What that means is that you should get the same sort of experience inside and out. Everything from working on spreadsheets to scrolling through web pages felt seriously smooth and easy on both displays.Switching between the two screens felt relatively seamless as well. You can set the phone to move the app you’re using from the main display onto the cover screen when you fold it over, although the cover screen is a bit too slender for some more complex tasks.The main screen looks tougher than on previous generations because the ridge from the crease isn't as deep, but the fold in the centre does still make it look weaker down the middle. Head-on, you can’t really see the crease, it’s only when you glance at it from an angle that it becomes more obvious.There’s one new feature that you might miss if you’re not paying attention. The entire phablet display is uninterrupted because Samsung has done away with the hole punch style camera and replaced it with their first-ever under-display camera. Pixels are applied on top of the camera hole which is meant to make it look almost completely invisible.It does improve your experience when you’re streaming video, playing games or making video calls. However, you can still see the lens when the whole screen is completely white, black or when the light catches it. So although it seems like a good idea, it isn’t quite as impressive as I expected it to be.Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G packs the high-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor along with 12GB of RAM and a choice of either 256GB of storage or 512GB. The handset I tested has 512GB.The phone is undoubtedly fast, whatever you need it for. It’ll happily chug along with loads of apps open, or with three windows displayed on the screen at once. Mobile games load very quickly and I didn’t find any problems with lag. That’s backed up by its Geekbench 5 scores, it managed to bag 1,087 in single-core and 3,415 in multi-core which is higher than its predecessor and similar to recent flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus and the OnePlus 9 Pro.5G and Wi-Fi 6E means that you can make the most of superfast internet wherever you are if you live in an area that supports it or you have a compatible router.Powering the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is a 4,400mAh battery, it did a good job at lasting through the day with different apps and windows open at once. In terms of productivity that’s a great thing and should mean you don’t need to worry about running out of juice. I tested the battery out by running a locally stored video on full brightness over two hours. In that time the battery level dropped by 10% so would have lasted about 20 hours in total. Not only is that better than a lot of mid-range and even flagship phones but it's even a slight improvement on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. Charging it back up again was equally as speedy, it took just over an hour.Do bear in mind that there’s no power adaptor included in the box, just a USB-C cable so you’ll need to buy that separately if you don’t have one already.Neither the Fold nor the Fold 2 had many apps that were optimised to the larger display. Often that meant certain controls were over the crease or some apps like Instagram just didn’t work quite right. That’s an issue Samsung has made an effort to tackle by collaborating with developers from the likes of Microsoft and Google to design apps made specifically for Fold devices.By the time the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is launched at the end of August 2021, most of the top 100 apps in the Google Play Store will have been tailored to fit the main screen. For any that aren’t, you can use the new Labs feature. When it's switched on it’ll automatically adjust the aspect ratio of the app window to fit the screen, and will let you use it simultaneously with other apps.Samsung has also improved the Multi-View where you can have up to three app windows open at once. Depending on the task at hand, you can adjust the size of each one individually. That means you can have a video call going on the top while your emails and a web browser are open on the bottom, for example.With the maximum number of windows open at once, it’s quite difficult to use the two smaller ones because they are just so tiny on this size screen. But I can’t deny that it all feels much more user friendly and optimised than it did before.Flex Mode comes on when the screen is partially folded, it shifts app content to the top half of the screen and places all of your controls like brightness or volume onto the bottom half. Samsung has also adjusted the size of the menus which ultimately makes them easier to use without disrupting what you’re already doing on the display.Even the home screen makes more sense, it feels much more like a tablet or computer desktop than a phone because the Fold 3 fits more icons onto the screen at once.In terms of productivity, these upgrades make the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G more efficient to use. You will have to get used to using all of these features though as there are just so many ways to use this phone!For the first time in the Fold series, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G has S Pen support. It connects using Bluetooth and you’ll be able to use it across all of your compatible Samsung Galaxy phones, tablets and laptops.For those who don’t own other Galaxy devices, Samsung has just introduced the brand new S Pen Fold which is exclusive to the Fold3. It’s a shorter version of the S Pen which is just 132mm long. It’s perfectly designed to sit alongside the phone. It's also very easy to carry with you when you’re on the go.When I tried it out, I thought it was incredibly practical and great for multi-tasking. You can use it to take quick notes while you're watching a video, or you can crop out pieces of the screen in a matter of seconds and paste it into a document you're working on. Another great feature is Air Commands which lets you take a picture or pause a show when you click the button on the pen.At the time of writing, you can claim a free S Pen Fold when you buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G. Alternatively, you can buy the S Pen or S Pen Pro separately.The camera tech hasn’t changed from the Fold 2, it’s still the same 12MP wide camera, 12MP ultra-wide camera and a 12MP telephoto lens as before, as well as having a 10MP selfie camera on the cover screen. The 4MP under-display camera on the main screen is new but you’d use that more for video calls than anything else.It is a massive shame there haven’t been any camera upgrades. When you’re spending this much on a phone you want the cameras to be excellent rather than just good, even if you’re not one for mobile photography.Like its predecessor, the camera on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 doesn’t quite match up to Samsung’s flagship S series smartphones.While you can expect bright shots across the board and plenty of detail from the default settings, you won’t get a strong balance between light and dark areas. You may also find some colours look a little dull. When you switch to ultrawide mode, you’re sure to lose out on detail as well. Photos taken at night are sufficiently lightened though which is good. Take a look at some example shots from the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3’s rear camera system below.When it comes to the two front cameras, the 4MP under-display snapper isn’t great, photos came out looking very grainy. So you definitely won’t be taking selfies with it, but for video calls, it will do. The 10MP selfie camera on the cover screen is much better and is capable of taking bright, flattering selfies.Samsung's folding phones give you some camera features you won’t get elsewhere. In comparison to earlier models, the Capture Modes and Dual Preview have been adjusted to use the main screen and cover screen even more effectively.With the phone partially folded, you can change where everything sits on the display, as well as use Capture View to scroll through earlier photos while you’re composing your next shot. For instance, you can move your camera roll to the top half of the screen and place the camera preview on the bottom half which will help you take low-angle shots more easily. Or, with the main screen laid out flat, you can preview your shot in more detail using the entire 7.6inch display.If you want to take photos hands-free, you can flex the screen and place it on a table in front of you, then you just need to hold your hand up to trigger the camera's timer.You can also preview shots on the cover screen which means you'll be able to use the rear cameras to take selfies while being able to see yourself on the front display. Using Dual Preview, the live view from the camera appears on each side of the phone so both the photographer and subject can see what the picture will look like.So while Samsung hasn’t improved the actual camera tech, they have made the system much more customisable and in doing so, easier to use. They're fantastic features which will help you take better pictures than ever.When it comes down to it the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G does actually seem like a folding phone worth buying if you're someone who could make the most of it.Not everything about it is perfect. For some, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G will still be too pricey. For others, it'll still be a bit too chunky. You might also find the under-display camera underwhelming, while the crease could still get in your way. There are definitely some areas that Samsung can improve on here.Despite having a few downsides, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is still the best folding phone out there right now. It will boost your productivity on the go, give you more immersive gaming on the main screen and it’ll be great for streaming video on long journeys. The super-long battery life is a major plus-point too.Reserve your new phone from Samsung Unpacked hereWhile the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G is currently the best folding phablet style phone you’ll find, there are some other options out there. The Huawei Mate Xs offers a bigger screen that folds in the opposite way to the Fold 3 so there’s just one display that wraps around the outside of the phone. It is still incredibly pricey, though.If you want something more compact, then you could consider clamshell-style folding phones which fold out to the size of a normal smartphone. One of the top picks is the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G, but the Motorola Razr is a good option as well. It’s cool, pocket-friendly and has solid everyday performance.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-5g-review

5G: YesWhat you should take away from this Samsung Galaxy S20 review is that this is still a truly fantastic piece of kit in 2021. And it's cheaper now than it was before which makes it a great time to buy one.With a high-quality camera, fast speeds and a stunning design it's still the beauty that it was when it was first launched in early 2020. For more sophisticated features you could also consider buying the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra.To make the review as easy as possible to navigate, we've split it up into several sections: design, screen, camera and hardware, so you can get a comprehensive look under the hood of the Samsung Galaxy S20.The Samsung Galaxy S20 5G won the prestigious Best 5G Phone award at the T3 Awards 2020 so at the time of its reign, it was a truly excellent smartphone.The contents of the S20 boxTo cut straight to the chase: the Samsung Galaxy S20 is a great phone. Compared to the enormous S20 Ultra it's a veritable pocket rocket, with many identical utilitarian, premium features in a much smaller package. It loses out in some areas though - it doesn't have that enormous 108MP, 100x zoom camera system and the battery is lower by almost a fifth, but at £400 less, it's arguably better value for anyone except serious smartphone photography enthusiasts.Check out all the best Samsung Galaxy S20 deals:Watch blockbusters like Avengers: Endgame on one of the best smartphone screens around todayAt 6.2 inches the Samsung Galaxy S20 is hardly the biggest phone in Samsung's lineup. With the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and S20 Ultra looming over it, it's not even the biggest in its own range. Nevertheless, the practically bezel-less screen, interrupted only by a tiny punch-hole is more than enough for everyday tasks and looks great, even if it's not the sumptuous widescreen movie and gaming experience you could find on the S20 Ultra.However, at 6.2"" it's almost unfair to compare it to the massive Ultra. The S20's AMOLED screen is crisp and clear, displaying HQ Youtube videos, movies and games alike with no softness. Likewise, the speaker offers great power with very little of that ""tinny"" nature smartphone speakers can so often have. However, with no headphone jack, the top-quality wired headphones on the market can't be used: you're restricted to USB-C or Bluetooth.Although it's not as expansive as the rest of the range, the screen more than holds its own. The 120Hz refresh rate provides clean, silky-smooth movement as we swipe through the phone's home screen options, and it's hard to describe just how good this is: the slick motion almost feels tactile as you slide through screens and scroll through apps, all with Samsung's excellent One UI 2 interface.It's a perfect compliment to the easy-to-navigate Android 10, combining to create a genuinely enjoyable user experience. Even something as simple as navigating apps has become a thing of beauty, and over the two weeks I used it, it did not get old, to the point it'll be tough to go back to a lower refresh rate. If you think your current smartphone looks smooth in motion, just wait until you try this.The phone's curved gorilla-glass back looks great and is iP68 protected against water and dust, for ease of mind. The design is smooth, streamlined and reflective of its premium innards.Samsung has placed great stock in the camera equipment of all three devices, and they don't disappoint. They are the star of the show, dominating a big chunk of the back of the handsets with their distinctive rectangular modules.The 12MP ultra-wide and wide-angle lenses and the 64MP main camera present a combination that's clear and responsive with excellent colour balance. The wide angles proved great when capturing groupshots and scenery snaps and even without the S20 Ultra's massive 108MP, exceptionally fine points can be captured in mid-range shots. The telephoto conveys depth as well as detail even with the absence of a time-of-flight sensor.The details and depth in this hedgerow elephant illustrates the potential of the S20's camera system.The S20's 30x zoom function isn't nearly as powerful as the gargantuan Ultra, but it's still powerful enough to pick out information from very far away and give budding smartphone photographers ""distance flexiblity"", the ability to adjust shots on the fly while making the most of your own position.However, at max zoom, the softness is inevitably present and detail is lost, so it's best to use the functionality to adjust your photos at mid-range. For example, here's a gallery of three photos depicting the same church, taken at 1x, roughly 5x and at maximum 30x zoom. They were all taken while standing in exactly the same spot, and it illustrates just how impressive the zoom function really is. Check it out below:While its 8K video functionality is a technical marvel, most people (those without an 8K TV) won't get to enjoy it to its fullest extent, as they won't be able to view it for a while until the technology becomes more widely available.The excellent (and very useful) scan-to-capture mode makes a welcome return to the flagship Samsung range. In the few weeks I tried the phone for, this was one of my most-used features. Simply hover over a document and snap it, and the phone will prompt you to save it as a document and process it as a scanner would, easily exporting it as a PDF.It's one of a host of features that appear across the S20 range, with software such AR emojis, a dedicated food-shot mode and AI-assisted image capturing aiding photographers to get the right shots. For the most part, the AI assistance is welcome in lining up scenery or mid-range object shots, but it does struggle slightly in placing faces in the right quadrant.The punch-hole selfie camera's 10MP sensor is a far cry from the Ultra's massive 40MP front-facing camera. Consequently, you'll find it difficult to pick out background details. For example, in the selfie shot below, it's tough to pick out the book titles in the background of this image.The foreground selfie itself comes out perfectly fine and clear, but it's all very standard issue at this point and nothing to write home about, especially if you want one of those over-the-shoulder snaps with Niagara Falls or the Brandenburg Gate as the backdrop. However, I'm nitpicking: the excellence of the rear-facing camera module more than offsets these slight discrepancies.Now comes the guts. The three models in the Samsung Galaxy S20 range are all equipped with the same processor, the Exynos 990 CPU (a Snapdragon 865 in the US), and an Adreno 650 GPU. It's a powerful pocket rocket, able to process complex files (such as, oh we don't know, super-high resolution pictures of hedgerow elephants) without breaking a sweat. With less work to do in the S20 than the S20 Ultra, the phone whistles along at lightning speeds, taking even the most complex task with ease.The phone packs a 4,000mAh battery, which will do at the very least a full day of moderate use, but it's not quite the workhorse of the S20 Ultra, which rocks a huge 5,000mAh battery. Given that the S20 has a lot of the S20 Ultra's most premium features, battery life does suffer as a result of this.If you keep the screen on a medium brightness setting and stick to 60Hz, you'll easily get more than a day and a half out of the Samsung Galaxy S20's ample battery life. However, why buy a premium phone if you won't use premium features? If you've got its buttery 120Hz on constantly and you're consuming media, gaming or moving files around for great lengths of time, you will see battery life suffer, and you'll have to start thinking about charging it by late afternoon with very heavy use. But for most users, it'll get through your working day without issue.The phone also includes the now-familiar underscreen fingerprint sensor and facial recognition of its predecessors. However, the fingerprint sensor is quite sluggish, sometimes even taking three or four tries before unlocking effectively. Compared to a rival flagship (I was testing the Oppo Find X2 Pro at the time, which proved very zippy) it's not the most intuitive fingerprint unlock at all.Audio on calls usually came out crystal clear on both ends, whether they were through the S20 or via a separate, third-party app such as Whatsapp, but we did have slight issues with the speaker phone functionality, as the mic struggled to pick up my voice clearly when I was more than a metre away, while indoors. For multiple parties communicating via a single phone on a speaker call, this could present a minor issue.The Samsung Galaxy S20 is, without a shadow of a doubt, an excellent flagship smartphone. Is it perfect? No. Is it too much phone for some? Yes. Is it awesome, packed full of great features, with a really enjoyable design and UI? Yes.The Galaxy S20 is a powerful pocket rocket and a great start to Samsung's next generation of flagships. It's got powerful insides, a great camera system and 5G support across sub-6, mmWave, and NSA.For users that want an awesome 5G Android flagship and either don't care about 100x zoom cameras or don't want to shell out over £1,299 for a phone, the Samsung Galaxy S20 is among the best phones on the market. It's certainly more than powerful enough to rival anything Apple can throw at it. Despite a few minor niggles, the Samsung Galaxy S20 comes very highly recommended.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s20-review

OS: Android 10 \ Oxygen OS 10.5Over time this OnePlus 8 Pro review has been updated with new findings and takes. When it first hit the scene, we were blown away and it even won both the Best Phone and Gadget of the Year awards at the T3 Awards 2020. Now we are in 2021 and it's been pushed aside by the even more impressive OnePlus 9 Pro. Don't think that makes this any less capable though, in fact, it could actually be the best time to buy it because it's cheaper than it was before.Anyone looking for the very best phone you can buy should first consider the Apple iPhone 12 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra which has just upped the game when it comes to power and performance on Android smartphones.For direct competition to the OnePlus 8 Pro, take a look at the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro both of which offer big specs and great value. And that's saying nothing about the two mid-range phones from OnePlus in the form of the OnePlus 8T and OnePlus Nord. Plus they've just released an impressive cheap phone, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. This manufacturer isn't playing around, they're covering every inch of the market.So, the question today in 2021 is: can the OnePlus 8 Pro still cut it? Let's find out.In a nutshell, the OnePlus 8 Pro is not only one of the best phones that OnePlus has ever made but also one of the best Android phones from the last couple of years period. Granted, times are moving on but it's still managing to keep up. This is still a phone that helps cement the manufacturer's spot towards the top of the smartphone league table.Where OnePlus phones have, in the past, taken down rival flagships by delivering superb core functionality (remember all those flagship killers like the OnePlus 6), the OnePlus 8 Pro does so while also delivering a well-rounded package of advanced features and a gorgeous design, which had been missing in part on past devices. The OnePlus 8 Pro also has a jaw-droppingly beautiful and premium display you'd only expect to see on much more expensive smartphones.To discover why I rate the OnePlus 8 Pro so highly in more detail read on.In the OnePlus 8 Pro box you get the phone, see-through protective case, and WarpCharge 30T charging cable with plug.The OnePlus 8 Pro starts at £799 for the base model and rises to £899 for the top of the range variant in the UK. In the United States the phone retails for $899 and $999 respectively. The phone is available to order right now in the UK and hits stores shelves on April 21st, 2020. US orders are available from April 29th.The phone comes in three colourways, Glacial Green, Ultramarine Blue and Onyx Black, which represent the device's two different variants. The Onyx Black OnePlus 8 Pro comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage, while the Glacial Green OnePlus 8 Pro and Ultramarine Blue One comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage space (the model reviewed).In the OnePlus 8 Pro box you get the phone itself, as well as a transparent protective case and WarpCharge 30T charger. In addition, owners get the now traditional glossy OnePlus look book / manual, which runs through the phone's hardware and software.As I've said before, the attention to detail placed on how each OnePlus phone is delivered to customers is second to none in my opinion, and the OnePlus 8 Pro is another great example of that. The whole package radiates a feeling of premium.The OnePlus 8 Pro is great looking phone and boasts the best screen I've ever seen on a smartphone.And, speaking of premium, the first thing we absolutely have to talk about in this OnePlus 8 Pro review is the phone's display, which is the best screen I have ever seen on a smartphone.How special is it? How does a 120Hz refresh rate and a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 sound! And, what're more, that 120Hz QHD+ screen is also HDR10+ certified. Yes, we're talking a proper god-tier display here and one that smokes everything else on the market today.Indeed, unless Huawei or Samsung pull something pretty darn special out of their hats with their Note 20 and Mate 40 ranges later in the year, right now I honestly can't see this display being beaten in 2020.Other phones have delivered 120Hz, QHD+ and HDR10+ in part but none to date has offered them all up at once. For example, even the mighty Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra could only offer a 120Hz refresh rate with a FHD resolution, meaning if you wanted to run its screen at its most rapid you had to take a hit in visual quality.That compromise is not necessary here with the OnePlus 8 Pro's 6.78-inch Fluid AMOLED panel (which is also capable of a maximum brightness of 1,300 nits!) and, as we shall see later on the review, the phone delivers this no compromise experience without battery issues, either.The OnePlus 8 Pro's jaw-dropping screen delivers 120Hz, QHD+ and HDR10+ all at once. 🤯In terms of design, the most notable changes from late last year's OnePlus 7T Pro is that the pop-up selfie camera has now been replaced with an in-screen pin-hole camera, which is located in the top left hand corner of the display.The pin-hole is, as they go, very small and unobtrusive — both when watching full screen videos and playing games I can't say that I noticed it at all, or was left going, ""Damn! If only I could see that extra 3.85 mm of screen at the periphery of my vision then I wouldn't have died playing Call of Duty!""That said, though, as I have said before I feel smartphone enthusiasts the world over are now just waiting for those teased under-screen selfie cameras to launch, and then we can all finally put the era of the notch, pop-up and hole-punch to bed for good.Elsewhere, the OnePlus 8 Pro does carry over much of the same aesthetic of the 7T Pro, though, with a vertically mounted and centrally positioned rear camera array, gorgeous curved glass display, and cool to the touch frame and backplate.The phone's volume rocker is located on the left hand side, while power and OnePlus' now traditional silent/vibrate/ring switch is located on the right hand side. USB Type-C handles power and data transfer and is flanked on the bottom edge by the phone's SIM card slot (which, yes, can take 5G SIM cards).Lastly in terms of build quality, the OnePlus 8 Pro is the first phone the Chinese maker has produced that is officially IP68 water and dust proof rated. For years I had been highlighting that, while not a deal breaker, this was not an ideal state of affairs for a maker that produced otherwise such great phones, so I am happy to see that OnePlus has made this change.Unsurprisingly considering how well equipped the OnePlus 8 Pro is all games ran flawlessly on it while on test.OnePlus has never disappointed in terms of core hardware and that is how the brand attained its reputation as a cult favourite that produces flagship killing handsets.And, as you would expect from its new flagship, the OnePlus 8 Pro does not disappoint, coming loaded with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 system on a chip, 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM, an Adreno 650 GPU, and 256GB of UFS3.0 internal storage space.The RAM alone is 30 per cent faster than before, which partnered with the best Android SoC in the business (25 per cent performance boost over previous chipset), a rapid mobile GPU, as well as that fat wodge of UFS3.0 flash storage, which also delivers much enhanced read and write speeds, and the OnePlus 8 Pro is astonishingly quick.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 899Multi-Core Score: 3320[Compute]OpelCL Score: 2985Vulkan Score: 2641Indeed, when these components come together with the aforementioned 120Hz, QHD+, HDR10+ screen, the phrase ""buttery smooth"" doesn't even cut it in describing just how rapid, slick and smooth every application is.From simple UI navigation, right through to playing gaming, browsing the internet, watching videos and taking and browsing videos and images, the OnePlus 8 Pro is faster and slicker than any other phone I've used to date.Benchmark scores, as you would expect, are also very impressive. In GeekBench 5 the OnePlus 7T, which I loved on review last year, racked-up a Single-Core Score of 788 and Multi-Core Score of 2,865 in its CPU tests, while also accruing 2,675 points in the OpelCL Score and 2,333 in Vulkan.Gamers will absolutely love the OnePlus 8 Pro thanks to its spacious, quality screen and rapid internal hardware.The OnePlus 8 Pro, though, hits new heights, bagging a Single-Core Score of 899, a Multi-Core Score of 3,330, an OpelCL Score of 2,985 and 2,641 in Vulkan. Those are sizeable increases across the board on their own, but when you factor in the absolutely smoking-hot display, the everyday usage experience is markedly improved in my opinion over past handsets.Everything about the OnePlus 8 Pro is just so fast and slick it's almost surreal. As someone who reviews a lot of smartphones, there's normally always one experience where I find myself operating ahead of the phone, and end up waiting for it to catch up. That is absolutely not the case here with the OnePlus 8 Pro, though — the phone is eye-bleedingly quick and, in terms of performance, blew me away.And that is saying nothing of the fact that the OnePlus 8 Pro delivers full 5G network connectivity (Qualcomm X55 modem), too, meaning that your data downloading and streaming can now be as blisteringly fast as your handset's hardware. Best phone screen ever + smoking hot, flagship-grade internal hardware + 5G = [drooling noises]...The rear camera array remains in the same location as the 7T Pro, but now protrudes a touch more.Hardware and performance have always been strong points for OnePlus, though, whereas camera systems have, traditionally, been an area where it has been beaten by rivals. Which is why I've spent increasing amounts of time over the past few years testing OnePlus' phones in terms of camera credentials.In terms of tech, OnePlus serves up a rear camera array loaded with a 48MP main snapper (Sony IMX 689), 48MP wide-angle (Sony IMX 586), 8MP telephoto, and 5MP photo chromatic colour filter. In terms of zoom you get a rather standard 3x zoom and 30x digital zoom.In terms of those two 48MP shooters, as can be seen in the below image gallery you get some really nice results. Image crispness and colour reproduction is good, while noise is also minimal; focus time was also very fast.Macro photography was also a pleasure, with the OnePlus 8 Pro accurately capturing fine details up close. Vibrancy and low-light functionality is still beaten by a few top-tier rivals in my option, but overall I think the results this camera system delivers are really strong.Yes, this handset delivers the best camera results OnePlus has managed to date, and I think the phone's UltraShot HDR function, which smartly merges multiple shot frames into one image for optimal colour, light, sharpness etc is largely responsible for that. For regular guys and girls who just want to point and capture the world around them, I think it is well pitched.In terms of zoom, though, things are very much par for the course here, and the OnePlus 8 Pro is beaten quite comfortably by rival flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and Huawei P30 Pro. Scroll though the two image galleries below to get a taste for the OnePlus 8 Pro's zoom abilities.As can been seen, at 0.6x, 1x and 3x, image quality remains high, however as soon as you stray into the digital zoom levels, culminating in the max-zoom 30x shot at the end the galleries, image quality nose-dives. What you are shooting is discernible (I was impressed actually that I could still just make out the Westbury White Horse in the lower gallery) but there's no way anyone is printing out those images to stick on their wall.Now, look, a lot has been made of smartphone zoom functionality recently, with the Mate 30 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, and Huawei P30 Pro each offering systems that take zoom functionality to new heights. And, yes, I think that is impressive and is a nice feature to have at your disposal. Sometimes you do want to capture something at distance and it is nice to have results that are beautiful and high-fidelity, rather than blurry and unusable.However, crazy zoom functionality alone does not a good smartphone camera system make.Portrait mode on the OnePlus 8 Pro delivered great results, with fine subject detailing and subtle background bokeh.Every other aspect I would argue that you would want from a smartphone camera system is delivered by the OnePlus 8 Pro, though, such as a wide-variety of shooting modes (time-lapse, panorama, portrait, nightscape and pro), a suite of strong lenses, and a fast and easily navigable camera system UI.And I found using the OnePlus 8 Pro's camera system a pleasure, despite its standard zoom abilities, so make of that what you will. Is the lack of a crazy 100x zoom a deal breaker for me? Absolutely not. Would I ideally prefer the camera system from the S20 Ultra or P40 Pro? Yes, as they are better. But that doesn't mean the OnePlus 8 Pro's system isn't great.As for the 16MP front-facing pin-hole selfie camera, I thought it delivered sharp images.The OnePlus 8 Pro's front-facing selfie camera in action.Lastly, in terms of camera system, the OnePlus 8 Pro supplies the ability to capture video at a 4K resolution and with optical image stabilisation. It also has a tri-mic setup for audio zoom, meaning that you can now better capture audio at distance when shooting.Video resolutions to shoot in are numerous, though, an include 1080p at 30fps and 60fps, 4K at 30fps and 60fps, and 4K CINE (so shot in 21:9 like a movie) at 30fps and 60fps. The OnePlus 8 Pro also shoots ""'3-HDR"" video, which delivers far better dynamic range in captured footage.Other video functions of note include the phone's Slow Motion shooting modes, which allow footage to be captured at 720p 480fps or 1080p 240FPS. For a taste of what the latter mode is like, check out the below video where I inadvertently unveil my history with the Harlem Globetrotters.Software-wise the OnePlus 8 Pro runs Android 10 and Oxygen OS 10.5, which is OnePlus' own light skinning. As mentioned above, this user interface combo runs like a dream on the handset and is super fast and responsive under the finger (the screen has a touch sensitivity of 240Hz and uses a technique called Motion Estimation Motion Compensation to deliver this).In terms of features, this OnePlus phone now delivers wireless charging and reverse wireless charging, which just like the IP68 rating, were things not offered by the maker's past devices. Once again, these are really welcome additions and help the Pro really stand out in my mind as a proper flagship phone, and not just a well-specced wannabe.Where the OnePlus 8 Pro also joins the true flagship top table is in its battery, which makes a jump up from the OnePlus 7's 4,000 mAh battery to a stacked 4,510 mAh unit.This stack of cells grants the phone proper use-all-day functionality with all its bells and whistles turned on and, while I wouldn't want to stretch much into a second day without a charge, the fact the phone can be charged from 1 per cent to 50 per cent charge in just 23 minutes thanks to its WarpCharge 30 Wireless charger means that running it as it should, with 120Hz and QHD+ turned on, is super easy. Phone maker equips new phone with suitable battery and charger shocker!It is simply impossible not to recommend the OnePlus 8 Pro.Which, in turn, brings us to the end of this OnePlus 8 Pro review. OnePlus has said many times over the years that the thing that separates the maker from others is that they actually listen to the fan base and evolve their phones in line with their input.Well, the OnePlus 8 Pro feels to me like the best example of this process to date, and one where things that, I for one, had levelled against the maker for years have been well and truly fixed.Last year when reviewing the OnePlus 7T, for example, I noted that its negative points included ""No wireless or reverse wireless charging"", ""No IP rating for dust or water"" and that its ""3,800 mAh battery is just acceptable"".In the OnePlus 8 Pro all of these issues have been rectified. And, while I also noted that the 7T and 7T Pro had camera systems that were beaten by rivals, which is something that is still the case with the 8 Pro, I feel that gap has been reduced and to all but real camera enthusiasts should not be considered much at all.So, OnePlus finishes its journey to the big leagues, to the proper flagship phone table, offering not just its usual fantastic mix of rapid hardware, slick software and eye for design detail, but also a full suite of advanced smartphone features and a strong camera system, too.Oh, and it does all this while also offering a genuine piece of razzmatazz, a smartphone screen that will simply leave your jaw on the floor. Great job OnePlus!",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-8-pro
15,Sony Xperia 5 II,Sony Xperia 5 II review: still a great phone almost a year on from its launch,"This Sony Xperia 5 II review is aimed at anyone looking for a decent smartphone with an excellent camera.Following on from the Sony Xperia 5, the next instalment is slightly more affordable than the Sony Xperia 1 II, but that doesn't mean it's cheap. It's still more towards the top end of mid-range. You can pick one up for around £649 / $741.99 at the time of writing.You might be able to find a bargain, so take a look at the widgets on this page to see the more up-to-date pricing.In the UK, that puts it on price parity with the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE instead or buy the Google Pixel 5 instead of this and your savings are up to £200.Could the Sony Xperia 5 II be the next smartphone for you? We'll guide you through everything you need to know about this Sony handset, from how long you can expect the battery to last between charges, to the sort of results you're going to get from the camera.The Sony Xperia 5 II is out now and available to buy direct from Sony or from multiple networks, either SIM-free or on a choice of contracts – you certainly shouldn't find yourself short of places to buy it from. The widgets embedded on this page should be able to guide you towards the cheapest prices currently available on the web, but at the time of writing, you can get a SIM-free Xperia 5 II for £649 in the UK and $741.99 in the US.The Xperia 5 II definitely follows the same design template that other Sony phones have used over the last few years, though there are some refinements here (like the corners, which are a little more rounded than normal). It's an impressively sleek and compact slab of glass and metal, with a comfortable, lightweight feel in the hand. Blue and black are your colour options, and the phone comes with both a USB-C port for charging and data transfer at the bottom, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the top.Once again, the tall (or wide) 21:9 display dominates the device and dictates its overall shape and feel, and we think it's just a bit too tall to be comfortable – your mileage may of course vary. The narrowness does make it easier to hold in one hand, to be fair. The 6.1-inch OLED screen runs at a resolution of 1080 x 2520 pixels and offers a high-end 120Hz refresh rate too, which means websites and apps are super-smooth while scrolling.The bezels around the display are nice and thin, though not quite as thin as on some rivals. The top and bottom bezels are slightly chunkier – in the former case that's to fit in the selfie camera, an approach we actually prefer to a punch hole notch because it makes watching videos a much cleaner experience. With HDR and a bit of Sony Bravia TV technology baked in, the display shows off movies and shows fantastically well.As you would expect for this price, the phone is IP68 rated for protection against water and dust (it can be submerged in up to 1.5 metres or nearly 5 feet of water for 30 minutes without any serious damage). It has a dedicated Google Assistant button and a dedicated camera shutter button on the right as you look at it on the same side as the volume and power buttons. The fingerprint sensor is built into that power button, which we're not a fan of (it makes it harder to find the button, and means more accidental presses too).The Sony Xperia 5 II comes equipped with a triple-lens rear camera, made up of 12MP wide, 12MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and 12MP ultrawide lenses. Having both ultrawide and telephoto zoom on the same camera array isn't always a given, even at this price, so we're pleased to see it here. You get a single 8MP camera on the front of the phone for snapping your selfies.Given Sony's prowess in camera optics, we had high expectations for what the rear camera would be able to do as well. Thankfully, the Xperia 5 II doesn't disappoint in the photography department. It snaps shots quickly, with speedy and accurate focus, and a well-judged balance of colour, brightness and contrast. On-board HDR processing ensures darker and lighter areas don't get lost, while in terms of detail and noise the images stand up well to close scrutiny. These are pictures that are way above the base level of acceptable for social media.Low light performance is excellent as well. It's not quite up there with the best mobile cameras we've seen in terms of night shots, but it's able to get usable shots in almost pitch blackness without taking too many seconds over the exposure – and without brightening the picture to an unreasonable extent. Low light mode kicks in automatically, and it impresses the vast majority of the time that it's used.The 4,000 mAh battery fitted inside the Sony Xperia 5 II will get you through one-and-a-half days of use no bother at all, unless you're really pushing it – our two-hour video streaming test (at maximum brightness and low volume) knocked the battery down from 100 percent to 85 percent, which is a strong showing. There's 21W fast charging here, but there's no wireless charging, as there is on the Xperia 1 II.In terms of the specs on offer with the Sony Xperia 5 II, you get a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 865 processor from Qualcomm, and that's paired with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage (which you can expand further via a memory card slot). Whichever way you slice it, those are very decent specs for an Android phone in 2020, if not quite at the very cutting edge of the market.Geekbench 5 scores of 910 (single-core), 3369 (multi-core), and 3165 (OpenCL) prove that this phone is no slouch, and we're pleased to report that it races through apps, web browsing and even demanding games. We didn't notice any lag or sluggishness with the handset, and we think it'll last you a good few years before it needs replacing.We've already enthused about how movies and other videos look on the Sony Xperia 5 II, and the stereo speaker sound leaves a good impression too. Sony has added what it calls a dynamic vibration system, where the phone actually provides haptic feedback for loud and deep noises – it's actually pretty cool when you're watching videos and playing games, though you perhaps don't want to use it all the time.5G connectivity is on board, but oddly only in the UK, while the phone runs Android 10 with Sony's very light software skin on top. Bloatware is kept down to a minimum, but you do get two very useful apps for taking more granular control over your videos and photos (further increasing the appeal of the handset for people who are serious about mobile photography and movie-making).We really like what Sony has done here with the Xperia 5 II. It's packed with plenty of power, the screen is sharp and bright, the battery life is good, and the rear camera is excellent. It's got 5G on board (in the UK) and it's waterproof too. This is a phone that impresses and it's going to keep on impressing for plenty of years to come.In terms of weaknesses, we're not sure that the 21:9 display is going to be to everyone's tastes, and it is on the expensive side (especially in terms of dollars in the US, where you don't get 5G either)– there are a lot of great smartphones around this price and a little lower, so Sony is up against it in terms of pricing. There's no wireless charging here either, but most people can probably live without that.The phone stands out in the usual areas where Sony phones stand out: this is a company with a lot of expertise in making electronics, gadget displays, and miniature camera lenses (it provides the camera hardware for a lot of other phone makers). These are stand out strengths of Xperia 5 II too, so Sony is carrying on those trends.While we think the Xperia 5 II is a better deal than the Xperia 1 II – which has a bigger 6.5-inch display, a slightly better camera and wireless charging – the slightly unusual design and the slightly higher price stop it from being a perfect deal. Still, we think it's going to appeal to a significant number of users, especially those who enjoy watching movies on their phones and are serious about shooting photos and video too.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/sony-xperia-5-ii-review
16,Oppo Find X2 Pro,Oppo Find X2 Pro review: a premium flagship in every department,"What you should take away from this Oppo Find X2 Pro review is that this phone is still worth buying in 2021 because it balances price with performance, an impressive camera system and style.It was one of the best phones you could buy after it first launched although it has now been overtaken by the next in line, the Oppo Find X3 Pro.Sitting in the crowded upper-mid-range-to-flagship section of the market, the Oppo Find X2 Pro has a lot to prove but it's actually cheaper than ever right now. Up against some of the best Android phones, it takes a lot to stand out… and this phone certainly does.You might know Oppo better for its budget and mid-range handsets, such as the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom, but this is definitely built to go head to head with the like of the Samsung Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12. We think it manages to hold its own well, even now.Having launched in March 2020, the Oppo Find X2 Pro is widely available. Check the widgets on this page for the latest prices that you can pick up the phone for online, but at the time of writing you're going to have to pay very close to £1,000 to get your hands on it SIM-free. At the moment the phone isn't available in the US.You can buy the Oppo Find X2 Pro direct from Oppo itself, or from third-party retailers such as Amazon. It's also available to pick up from the likes of EE, Vodafone, and Carphone Warehouse.As soon as you pick up the Oppo Find X2 Pro you know this is a seriously premium-level phone – our review unit came in a rather fetching sage green shade with a faux leather finish, but you can also go for a brighter orange (again with the leather effect) or a more understated and conventional black (with a ceramic finish) if you prefer. It's thin, it's lightweight, and it looks every inch like a modern-day smartphone.The OLED screen is fantastic too, stretching 6.7 inches from corner to corner, and running at a sharp resolution of 1440x3168 pixels. The screen boasts HDR10+ support as well as a refresh rate of 120Hz (double the conventional 60Hz), which means that animations, menus and webpages look ultra-smooth while you're scrolling and moving around different screens on the phone.The display uses curved edges, which may or may not be to your liking – we tend to prefer flat edges but the curved option definitely has its own aesthetic appeal. What's most important is that colours are bright, details are pin-sharp, and everything that you bring up on this display looks fantastic: whether it's scrolling through webpages, watching videos, or browsing through social media apps, the Oppo Find X2 Pro screen is one of the best that we've seen recently.When it comes to detailed dimensions, the Oppo Find X2 Pro measures 165.2x74.4x9.5 mm for the leather phones and 8.8 mm for the ceramic model. The phone tips the scales at 200 grams for the leather models, and 217 grams for the ceramic edition. Those figures are a little heftier than other flagship phones that are on the market at the moment – the standard iPhone 12 handset is 7.4 mm thick, for example, while the regular Galaxy S21 model is 7.9 mm thick.The back of the phone looks classy and refined too, with a long rectangular camera module tucked away in the top left-hand corner as you look at the back of the device. Even the little mirrored Oppo logo, which might usually annoy us, isn't a problem – it actually adds to the polish of the phone as a whole. Competing with the big players in the market starts with getting the design right, and Oppo has definitely done that here.In terms of buttons and ports, there's the standard volume controls on the left of the phone as you look at it, the power button on the right, and a USB-C port on the bottom. The phone also has stereo speakers, which we found did a decent job of playing music and video audio in our testing. The Oppo Find X2 Pro also comes with an IP68 rating for protection against liquid and dust – it can survive in water up to a depth of 1.5 metres for up to 30 minutes.The Oppo Find X2 Pro features an impressive triple-lens 48MP wide + 13 MP periscope telephoto + 48MP ultrawide rear camera. Besides the ultrawide mode, useful for fitting much more in a single shot, the periscope telephoto camera – where the optics are placed vertically inside the case – enables optical zoom up to 5x. If you need to take long distance shots of wildlife, sports or landscapes, then having so much zoom in your smartphone can make a big difference. There's a 32MP wide selfie camera on the front.Photo and quality is another area where the Oppo Find X2 Pro really shines, with snaps taken by the phone mostly fantastic. Details are crisp and sharp, colours are wonderfully well balanced, shutter speed and focus are both really quick in operation, and as an added bonus there's an expert Pro mode that you can enable to take more control over settings like white balance and ISO speed.No matter what we were shooting with the Oppo Find X2 Pro, the results were top notch: these are photos that are too good for your social media pages really. Ultrawide, optical zoom and close-up shots look great, with no distortions or variations in colour as you switch through the various capabilities of the rear camera. Everything considered, we'd say it's one of the best smartphone cameras on the market at the moment.Even low light can't trip up the phone – it can capture an impressive amount of detail at night, with an impressively low level of noise, and while the night mode means that you need to keep the phone steady for a second or two, it's worth it for the results. When it comes to video, you can record at resolutions of up to 4K at up to 60 frames per second, and again the results are what you would expect from a premium-level phone.As far as Oppo Find X2 Pro battery life goes, in our two-hour video streaming test, where we ramp the screen brightness right up and put the volume on a low setting, the Oppo Find X2 Pro went down from 100 percent to just 87 percent, suggesting you can squeeze about 14 or 15 hours of video playback out of the phone. That's one of the best results we've seen recently, and it shows the 4,260 mAh battery is able to keep going for a substantial amount of time.There's no wireless charging here, but you do get super-fast 65W wired charging speeds – the best on the market right at the time of writing – and when you can juice up your smartphone that quickly, battery life doesn't matter so much. In general use the battery holds up well, and you'll easily get through a day and probably to the next morning on a single charge unless you're really pushing the phone in terms of gaming, screen use, GPS location tracking and so on.Take a look at the specs sheet for the Oppo Find X2 Pro and once again the phone's true flagship credentials stand out. The handset runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor – pretty much the top CPU for Android phones in 2020 – and pairs it with 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of (non-expandable) internal storage. That's a serious amount of power, and you'll be struggling to find a phone that very noticeably outpaces the Oppo Find X2 Pro for some time to come.Despite our best efforts we were unable to slow down the Oppo Find X2 Pro, no matter how many games we played or browser tabs we opened up. This is a phone that'll breeze through just about anything, as its high scores in the Geekbench benchmarking tool prove – it scored 909 for single-core performance, 3239 for multi-core performance, and 3210 for OpenCL performance in our tests, which is only slightly short of 2021 flagships running the newer Snapdragon 888 processor.There's no hint of lag or delay on the phone, whether you're flicking through social media or editing photos on the device (the 120Hz refresh rate of the display no doubt helps here too). This phone launched in March 2020, but it has one of the very best configurations of that year, and we suspect that it's going to stay speedy and fast for several years to come yet – the money that you spend on the phone is going to go a long way.There's 5G here, as we've mentioned, so you can get connected to the next-gen network speeds if they happen to have rolled out in your area, and it adds to the overall appeal of the phone. For the price you're paying for this handset you would expect 5G to be on board these days of course, but it's another box ticked – it's difficult to think of anything that the Oppo Find X2 Pro is missing, unless you need something out of the ordinary.The Oppo Find X2 Pro comes running Android 10, with Oppo's own ColorOS software on top. Like a lot of Android skins from the Chinese manufacturers, it's a bit too busy and invasive for our tastes, but it's a small annoyance on what is otherwise a great phone. Your mileage may differ, but we're happier using stock Android or something very close to it, without all the (mostly superfluous) extras that Oppo and other manufacturers feel like they have to stick on top.While ColorOS 11 (based on Android 11) has reportedly started rolling out on this phone, we haven't seen it on our particular device yet. Of the extra apps and features that ColorOS brings that you might find useful, there's Game Space for turning off notifications and managing performance while you're gaming, and Oppo Relax for calming your mind and body with some carefully curated nature sounds.We like just about everything about the Oppo Find X2 Pro – in fact, we love it. From the stylish design and the super-speedy screen, to the impressive performance and the quality of the photos and videos that this can capture, it's a fabulous all-round package. It's genuinely as good as the best smartphones on the market from the likes of Samsung and Apple, in just about every department too.This isn't quite a perfect phone, because the battery life isn't anything to write home about, and we're not huge fans of the ColorOS software that Oppo uses, but we're dealing with very small minuses up against a lot of plus points. On balance, the Oppo Find X2 Pro is definitely going to leave you impressed, and we reckon it's a phone that can carry on impressing for years to come as well.Having launched in March 2020, the phone is no longer brand new, but it's so good that it'll still stand up well against anything that 2021 brings. Unfortunately the price doesn't seem to have dipped too much since launch, and this is still a very expensive phone, which might put some of you off. It might be worth checking back on the pricing of the Oppo Find X2 after the launch of the Oppo Find X3 series phones, because if you're able to get it for less then it's going to be an even more appealing proposition.While the Oppo brand name might not carry the clout of an Apple or a Google or a Samsung, the Find X2 Pro shows that Oppo can make phones to challenge with the best of them, and while there are occasional annoyances when it comes to the software, you can say that about any smartphone. Don't let the Oppo badge put you off from making this your next smartphone upgrade, because it stands up to scrutiny.The very best aspects of the phone are that big, bright screen with the 120Hz refresh rate that makes just about everything look great, and the results you get from the camera, which we really liked. The Oppo Find X2 Pro brings a level of detail and clarity to the pictures that it captures that not many smartphone cameras can match, and the benefits of that 5x optical zoom shouldn't be underestimated either. Don't forget there's 5G on this phone too, so you're all set for the next-gen networks that are now rolling out.There's no doubt that this is one of the best phones on the market right now, and the imminent arrival of its successor isn't going to really change that – in fact it might make the Oppo Find X2 Pro even more appealing, if it gets a significant price drop when the newer models show up. It ticks every box you need ticking when it comes to a phone, and shows Oppo ready to compete with the flagship makers at the very top of the tree.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oppo-find-x2-pro-review

5G: YesTo bring you this Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review, I've been testing the phone out since January's Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event at CES. After more than six months of using the phone, I'll be best placed to tell you all about it.I've spent 5 years reviewing hundreds of smartphones for T3 - I've seen handsets come and go including the very best phones each year.Following on from one of last year's best Android phones, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra continues Samsung's winning streak. In fact, the phone has won the prestigious and much wanted Best Phone award at the T3 Awards 2021.This review is broken down into a few key scoring areas including the camera system, design, screen, performance and its wealth of features. I'll also go through the phone's price and release date, as well as where to pick up the best deals. But first, we've got an overview review video of the entire Samsung Galaxy S21 range.Want a high-end case to protect this phone? Then check out T3's best Samsung Galaxy S21 cases guide.The above video runs through the entire Samsung Galaxy S21 range, explaining the key specs and features of each phone. It shows what each phone is like in the hand, too, so if you want to see the Galaxy S21 Ultra moving and manipulated in real life then it is well worth a watch.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra price starts at $1,199 in the USA, £1,149 in the UK and AUD$1,849 in Australia.Meanwhile the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra release date is 29 January, 2021, with pre-orders for the phone already live (they started on 14 January, 2021).Right now the phone is available from a very wide range of networks and retailers, and up until the 29th the phone comes with a pre-order deal.Buy the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (or indeed any S21) from any retailer during the pre-order period and owners can then claim a completely free pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro and a Samsung SmartTag.Today's best Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra deals can be viewed directly below:There's no doubting how powerful and feature-packed the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra's camera system is.One of the foremost reasons I think anyone would pick up the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is for its camera system, so that is where the written part of this review begins.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 40MP front-facing camera and a quad-camera rear setup with an Ultra Wide 12MP camera, a second generation Wide 108MP camera and two 10MP telephoto cameras. It has 10x optical zoom and Samsung's famous 100x Space Zoom (see image galleries below for samples; click the arrow buttons or swipe at the sides to scroll through images).The S21 Ultra has a faster laser focus sensor than the other phones in the range, too, 12-bit HDR, 64x more colours and a faster, brighter noise sensor for better low-light photography.As for video the S21 Ultra can shoot 8K video at 24fps and 4K at 60fps with stereo sound recording, and it comes with both optical and electronic stabilisation. The front-facing camera can record in 4K at 30 or 60fps.Click the arrow buttons or swipe at the sides to scroll through images.Click the arrow buttons or swipe at the sides to scroll through images.Click the arrow buttons or swipe at the sides to scroll through images.Click the arrow buttons or swipe at the sides to scroll through images.As can be seen from the above image galleries, the level of zoom delivered by the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is very impressive, with multiple set zooms partnered by complete manual control to zoom in or out as the user wishes.As I noted last year with the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, the quality of the zoomed image remains strong even into the 30x-50x range, so you can legitimately use it to capture distanced objects or scenes.However, despite noticing small improvements over last year, as soon as you really push the zoom up towards 100x image quality degrades rapidly, culminating in the same watercolor effect at maximum zoom. Check the nearby zoom galleries to see what I mean.As such, while technically impressive, I feel the 100x zoom will have very limited usage in the real world.Portrait mode remains excellent on the S21 Ultra, offering great subject detailing and subtle bokeh.The impressive levels of zoom though are just one part of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra's camera system, which is undoubtedly impressive in scope, features and quality.Shooting modes are bountiful an include a fully manual Pro mode as well as Panorama, AR Doodle, Food, Night, and Portrait, the results of the latter clearly shown above. Samsung has really got Portrait mode on-lock now, with subjects captured and lit wonderfully, and backgrounds blurred out with subtle and not overbearing bokeh.There's a load of video shooting modes, too, including Portrait video, Pro video, Super Slow-mo, Slow-mo, Hyperlapse and Director's view. Director's view is neat as it lets you capture video from both the rear and front lenses simultaneously, so if you're a frequent vlogger or YouTuber, you'll be able to capture your reactions as events unfold.Click the arrow buttons or swipe at the sides to scroll through images.Click the arrow buttons or swipe at the sides to scroll through images.The 108MP main snapper is the everyday workhorse of the camera system, though, and remains a very impressive piece of kit. Detailing is high, noise is low and color balance and definition excellent in taken photos (see above image gallery), and what's even better is that unlike last year the camera's autofocus works quickly and as it should.I think at this point Samsung really is going toe-to-toe with Huawei over the best smartphone camera system crown, with Google, Apple and Sony making up the rest of the top five. I'm not professional photographer, but I could not pick a flaw or notable absence from the S21 Ultra's camera offering, while image quality to me is right up there with the best on the market.Various aspect ratios can be shot in, including 4:3, 16:9 and Full, which shoots at the entire dimensions of the screen.Samsung's useful Single Take function also returns on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. This mode works by recording an action over a period of 5 to 15 seconds (determined by the user) with all of the phone's rear camera lenses and then providing a range of shots and a video to choose from afterwards.It's a really great feature in my mind as it makes getting the ideal shot of something far easier and less error prone. Instead of constantly pulling the trigger on single images, this model uses AI to take multiple versions of the same event, as well as let you select your own golden moment from the captured video.Single Take mode provides you with a range of images and a video to choose from each time it is used.For example, above you can see a small selection of the Single Take images supplied when asked to capture the dancing girl. You can then select which you prefer and even go on to edit it further on the phone.And speaking of AI, the S21 Ultra's camera system is loaded with it, and in my mind at least it is utilised in a really nuanced and unobtrusive way – it simply helps you shoot better shots. For example, the phone has a built-in scene optimiser and, if you turn it on, a shot suggestion tool, too.Then there's loads of other automatic goodness, like tracking auto-focus (this keeps the subject in focus even if they move) and auto HDR, as well as built-in video stabilisation.Naturally, though, if you want to shoot without any fancy AI then you can also turn it all off. However, I think anyone but the most experienced of professional photographers will benefit from it being left on.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with a very large 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display.The hardware spec on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra reads like a phone enthusiast's dream setup, and the screen is just the start.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 1,109Multi-Core Score: 3,674[Compute]OpenCL: 7,398Vulkan: 6,419This handset comes with a huge 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED panel that also supports a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate and a WQHD+ 3200 x 1440 resolution which, crucially, can now both be enabled at the same time. Throw in HDR 10+ and a max brightness of 1,500 nits and you've got a display that matches and, whisper it, maybe even outpunches that on the OnePlus 8 Pro.The screen is simply gorgeous as a result and aside from the pin-hole selfie camera hole that sits top-center, is an uninterrupted slab of visual goodness that displays anything on it brilliantly. From lusciously smooth scrolling through Twitter, to immersive eye-popping colors in the latest HDR movies, and onto viewing art, digital magazines, art and more, it really is a pleasure to use.The screen, as you would expect, also displays mobile games brilliantly and I was genuinely taken back when watching the Wild Life graphical benchmark on it.In terms of design, the big change this year is that the phone's rear camera array now has a housing that blends into the phone's framing on the left and top edge. This results in a more sympathetic look, and does go a little way to hide how much the camera lenses protrude from the backplate. But if truth be told this is still a phone design that leans towards case usage.I love Samsung's Edge Screen and, as you would expect, it returns once more on the Galaxy S21 Ultra.That level of top-end premium is carried through to the core hardware spec, too, with the very latest Qualcomm flagship Android system on chip (SoC), the Snapdragon 888, sat at its heart. And this, in partnership with 12GB of RAM and an Adreno 660 GPU meant the S21 Ultra turned in some very impressive benchmark scores.While last year's S20 Ultra delivered a Single-Core Geekbench 5 score of 939, and a Multi-Core score of 2,815, the Galaxy S21 Ultra posted 1,109 and 3,674 respectively, which is a marked improvement.Wild Life: 5,687 (Average frame rate = 34.10fps)Sling Shot: 8,846Sling Shot Extreme (OpenGL ES 3.1): 7,769This enhanced performance carried over in terms of Geekbench 5's compute benchmark tests, too, with the S21 Ultra posting an OpenCL score of 7,398 and Vulkan score of 6,419.And this performance was doubled down on when I ran 3DMark's graphical benchmarks on the S21 Ultra. Last year the S20 Ultra managed to post a score of 6,765 in Sling Shot Extreme (OpenGL ES 3.1), while this year the S21 Ultra managed to best that with a score of 7,769.It also delivered really well in 3DMark's new graphical test Wild Life, outputting a score of 5,678 and an average frame rate of 34.10. And as you would expect, this meant that any mobile game that I threw at the S21 Ultra ran flawlessly – as a gamer this is a phone that delivers.That powerful hardware works in-sync with an Android 11 OS and Samsung's own One UI 3.1, which remains the best-in-class Android skin on the market. Combined these two mean that navigation around the phone is super rapid and very intuitive. Moving between apps is especially rapid, something also helped by the return of Samsung's Edge Screen, and loading happens instantaneously.You can use a digital stylus on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.Finally in this Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra review we have to talk about its new standout feature – the fact that it now supports digital stylus use. Now, to be very clear, the Galaxy S21 Ultra does not come with a digital stylus, and unlike the Note series phones the stylus cannot be charged and stored in the phone.Samsung's solution to this is to introduce its new S-Pen case, which is an optional extra that protects the phone and holds a stylus, as well as enable any stylus from its previous Note range to work with the phone. You can also buy new styli separately if you fancy an aftermarket S21 Ultra case with stylus support.I was not supplied with the new S21 Ultra stylus case for review and as such tested the new functionality with a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus stylus.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with digital stylus support, which is a first for the Galaxy S series.The results? The stylus works exactly the same way as on the Galaxy Note phones. When the tip approaches the screen the contextual stylus menu panel appears and allows you to access to features like note taking, document annotating, illustrating, and remote image taking.The inability for me to dock the stylus in the phone, charge it, or carry it around with me though did highlight how essential that extra spend will be if you genuinely want to make use of this feature.Samsung's really got this stylus functionality on-lock, though, and in truth no other maker offers anything like it. And with the flagship S series now offering the both the Note's historic strengths, in a very large screen and stylus functionality, it really does seem like the bell is tolling for it.Overall, I welcome the addition of stylus functionality to the S range, but I can't help shake the feeling that it isn't particularly well or cleverly implemented right now.There's no escaping the quality of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra.It is impossible for me not to recommend the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. It's a hyper-premium handset that delivers across the board, from internal hardware to camera system, screen space and fidelity to battery life, and onto advanced features like reverse wireless charging and the laptop-aping DeX Mode.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra also makes history in offering support for a digital stylus, which up until now has been the preserve of the Galaxy Note series alone. Indeed, the fact that the S21 Ultra now works with an S Pen really adds a new dimension to the Galaxy S range and, in my mind at least, finally removes any reason why an enthusiast would wait for the top-spec Note each year.Yes, the phone remains despite a price cut very expensive, but I honestly don't know what to say to that other than to shrug. This is a phone that has more powerful specs and performance than many laptops, and will easily see its owner not just a year or two, but in my mind going on half a decade. And when you take that into consideration, suddenly its high price is easier to swallow.As I've said before when reviewing Samsung's Ultra phones, this isn't a handset for everyone, but it's not built to be – it's another slice of smartphone royalty from the South Korean maker, and it will appeal massively to well-heeled phone enthusiasts and first adopters.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra
18,Motorola Moto G50,Motorola Moto G50 review: another budget phone with basic specs,"To sum up this Motorola Moto G50 review: it's a low-cost phone that will work just fine across the board. It’s not the best cheap phone you can buy but it’s definitely good enough for this price.The Motorola has something to offer everyone - from basic, budget smartphones right up to impressive mid-range handsets with plenty of power and some interesting extra features.The American manufacturer launched the newest additions to their G series of smartphones earlier in 2021, ranging from the Motorola Moto G10 up to the Motorola Moto G100. I’ve actually reviewed both of these phones and was surprised by just how much the manufacturer can squeeze into such affordable packages. Sitting in the middle of their refreshed lineup, you’ll find the Moto G30 and this, the Motorola Moto G50.You’re unlikely to see it in T3’s guide to the best phones you can buy because there aren't loads of sophisticated features and it won't give you knock-out performance. Everything about this phone is modest and it's the small price tag that is likely to draw you in. Read on to find out more about the Motorola Moto G50.You can buy the Motorola Moto G50 from retailers like Amazon for $260 in the US, £195 in the UK and AU$350 in Australia.The next phone down in the G series, the Motorola Moto G30, is slightly cheaper. So what makes the Motorola Moto G50 different and is it worth spending more money on? Truth be told, these phones are quite similar and the Moto G30 even outperforms this Motorola Moto G50 in some areas.The Motorola Moto G50 is ever so slightly smaller and lighter despite having the same 6.5inch HD+ screen. Both phones also have a 90Hz refresh rate. The biggest differences come down to speed. The Motorola Moto G50 has a more powerful chipset and it’s a 5G phone whereas the G30 isn't, so if better performance and fast internet are must-haves then it’ll definitely be worth spending a little more.Both phones use a 5,000mAh battery, but the G50 only has a 10W charger included in the box as opposed to the G30’s 20W. It’s not going to be a huge difference in practice though. They also have different camera systems, the cheaper Moto G30 has a quad-lens system with a 64MP main lens while the Motorola Moto G50 only has a triple camera with a 48MP main lens. There’s no dedicated ultrawide lens on the Motorola Moto G50. So although you do get better performance overall, you’re likely to get less when it comes to smartphone photography.Available in Steel Grey and Aqua Green, the Motorola Moto G50 looks like a simple, cheap smartphone measuring 164.9 x 74.9 x 9mm and weighing about 192g. Its back casing is made from shiny plastic, while a matte plastic frames the phone. I found the phone fine to hold. It is a little prone to picking up fingerprint marks, though.On the back, the three-lens camera module sticks out slightly, but not so far that it’s annoying. It sits beside the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which I think is placed too far up the back of the device, but then I do have small hands. The bezels on the front are relatively thin, yet definitely still visible with quite a substantial camera notch at the top. You get a power button, volume controls and a dedicated Google Assistant button on the edge of the phone, with a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C charging as well.The 6.5inch HD+ (1600x720) display has a refresh rate of 90Hz so although it won't match up to the most impressive smartphone screens, it feels very fluid and smooth to use. The IPS display is colourful and bright as well as being big enough to comfortably stream video on. It could be sharper, but you don’t expect it to be super crisp at this price point anyway. It would have been nice to see a boost in the quality of the display over the cheaper G30, but overall what you do get here is perfectly fine.The rear camera system uses a 48MP main lens, a 5MP Macro lens and a 2MP depth sensor, while the front camera is 13MP. There's no ultrawide lens here which is a massive shame. Take a look at the gallery below for some examples of shots taken on the Motorola Moto G50.The camera is okay. It struggles to balance light and dark areas of the shot, and won't be able to pick up finer details from a distance. Up close it does a better job, but it seems pretty inconsistent. Some shots came out looking quite bland and colours didn't quite pop, yet in some photos that wasn't so much of an issue. It was alright at taking macro shots, however even these didn't have the level of detail you would get from a more sophisticated lens.The 8x digital zoom wasn't much use, photos came out blurred and grainy. You definitely won't be able to use it for social-media worthy shots. There are few other camera modes to play around with, there's nothing that I haven't seen before though.Inside the Motorola Moto G50, you’ll find the Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 budget chipset alongside a respectable 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage which can be expanded using a MicroSD card. This particular CPU supports 5G connectivity if you live in an area that supports it as well.This is by no means a fast phone, it will struggle with the most demanding mobile games but for most casual use it’ll do everything you need it to even when you have a few different apps and tabs open at once. On Geekbench 5, it scored 504 in single-core and 1,574 in multi-core which is better than a lot of other cheap phones. It even matches up to more pricey budget handsets like the OnePlus Nord CE 5G or the Oppo Find X3 Lite.The fact that the Motorola Moto G50 uses a 5,000mAh battery certainly bodes well for it lasting the full day without needing to be charged. In my experience, it easily got through a day of streaming music, scrolling social media and browsing the web.To test it out more rigorously, I ran a local video on full brightness over two hours, in that time the battery dropped by 16%. That suggests it would have lasted about 12 and a half hours from a full charge. That will be good enough for most, you’ll be able to rely on it not to run out of juice before you make it back home.  Using the 10W charger, it took almost 2 and a half hours to fully recharge the phone from empty so you will need to remember to plug it in long before you need to leave the house in the morning.Motorola has one of the best versions of Android 11. It’s not quite as clean as on the best Samsung phones but even so, it feels intuitive to use without being overly simple. The phone comes with all of the Google apps pre-installed and you’ll get all of the benefits of Moto Actions like lift to unlock, swipe to split the screen and the three-finger screenshot, all of which make using the phone more efficient.If you’re on the hunt for a cheap phone with 5G then this will be worth considering. It’s not going to wow you with specs or features but it’s so cheap that you can’t really expect too much from it.You will get decent performance and battery life from the Motorola Moto G50, as well as a large colourful screen which will be well suited to those who spend a lot of time browsing the web, streaming video or scrolling through social media apps. But if you’re looking for a good camera then that’s not something you’ll find here. You can definitely find a cheap phone that's just as good if not better elsewhere, although you may have to make a few sacrifices when it comes to speed.The Motorola Moto G50 is a definite step up from the cheaper Motorola Moto G10 which is an even more basic smartphone than this. However, if you want something a bit more sophisticated and you value a better camera over fast performance, then you should look towards the Motorola Moto G30 instead.If you’re searching for a phone with a good camera and you don’t mind spending just a little bit more then the Realme 8 Pro could be a good choice. The main lens is 108MP and manages to pick up plenty of detail. You’ll also get impressive battery life from it, even if it does fall down slightly in performance.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/motorola-moto-g50-review
19,Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G,Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G review: a productivity and creativity powerhouse,"To sum up this Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G review: without a shadow of a doubt, this is one of the best Samsung phones. It might be expensive but no wonder, it has a huge AMOLED display and the S Pen stylus is included.This is not a small and discreet handset – it's for people who want one of the best phones you can buy, those who want a top-tier piece of kit that pushes the bar as high as it goes.Every Note handset that Samsung has put out in recent years, such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has been a hugely impressive piece of work that have all featured at some time in T3's coveted guide to the best Android phones.Until very recently, they were the only Samsung phones to support the S Pen but now the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra does too. So, does that make the Note 20 Ultra a smart purchase today or should you be looking towards their Galaxy S series instead? This Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G review will explain all.The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G is available to buy now – at the time of writing you can buy it direct and SIM-free for £1,179 in the UK, $1,299.99 in the US and AU$1,999 in Australia, though check the widgets on this page for the latest deals on the phone.A variety of retailers will sell you a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G on a contract, including Virgin Media (from £44 a month), O2 (from £61 a month), EE (from £61 a month), and Three (from £39 a month). Those prices all vary depending on the length of your contract, how much you want to pay up front, how much data you need, and so on.The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G looks like a phone made for the super-rich (as indeed its price tag suggests) – all finely polished curves and a 6.9-inch, 1440 x 3088 pixel resolution, HDR10+ supporting AMOLED screen. It runs at 60Hz by default, but will ramp up to 120Hz if you knock down the resolution to 1080p FHD (a compromise that we think most people will be willing to make).Samsung has been making premium phones for many a year of course, and so it's no surprise that the Note 20 Ultra 5G is a gorgeous gadget that you simply can't fault from a design perspective (unless the design is simply not to your tastes). Black, white and bronze (the one that we had to review) are your colour choices, and they all have a certain appeal.If we did have to pick a flaw, we're not all that happy with the huge camera bulge at the back of the phone, which doesn't really fit in with the unbroken lines that characterise the rest of the phone. You won't be able to lie this phone flat on its back, and the bulge makes it more difficult to slip the Note 20 Ultra 5G into a pocket (as if it wasn't big enough already), but it wouldn't put us off buying the phone.The power and volume buttons are on the right-hand side of the device, with a USB-C slot on the bottom and the slot for the S Pen. As usual with the Note series, slotting the S Pen inside the phone is quick and easy, and it feels secure once it's locked in place. Even better, the phone is IP68 rated for full dust and water resistance.We're pleased to report there's a fantastic phone on the back of the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, and in particular the 5x optical zoom that's going to get you closer to whatever subject it is that you're photographing (the digital zoom goes all the way up to 50x, but you're unlikely to need it, and quality suffers at the higher levels). There's ultrawide here too, which means you get plenty of flexibility when it comes to framing your shots.The triple-lens 108MP wide + 12MP periscope telephoto + 12MP ultrawide rear camera produces pictures that are fantastically bright and sharp, with excellent colour reproduction that's maybe a touch too vibrant in certain situations. Dark and light spots are well-handled by the HDR processing, focus and shutter speed is good, and overall this is a camera that's definitely worthy of a flagship phone.Night mode shots come out reasonably well too, though we think that the Google Pixels and even the Apple iPhones are ahead of Samsung in this area – though of course they don't have 5x optical zoom. The brightening effect Samsung uses is just a bit too aggressive, though it will definitely help the camera pick out details where there's very little light available (if you can keep the phone steady for a few seconds).Battery life is satisfactory without being spectacular, which is perhaps to be expected considering the huge screen, super-fast processor and 5G. While you will make it to the end of most days with some charge left, you might need a top-up during the day if you're really stressing your phone. Our two-hour video streaming test (at maximum brightness) saw the phone battery dip from 100 percent to 82 percent, suggesting around 10 hours of movie watching is possible.There's a huge amount of power on board the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, led by the Exynos 990 processor (or the Snapdragon 865 Plus, depending on your region). That's paired with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of storage, which would outclass many a laptop, never mind other smartphones. The components installed here will cope easily with anything you want to do and any app you want to run on your smartphone.We can confirm that the Note 20 Ultra 5G is blazingly fast in day-to-day use, even if you've got all of your favourite apps loaded up at once and dozens of tabs on the go in your web browser. The Geekbench benchmark scores of 930 (single core), 2815 (multi core) and 5098 (OpenCL) confirm that this is one of the most powerful smartphones ever released – so powerful in fact, that it offers more speed than a lot of people are really going to need.Once again though, the key feature of the Note 20 Ultra 5G – as with other Notes before it – is the S Pen. This super-responsive stylus is the main reason most people will get this phone, and it gives you the usual, slick pointing and scribbling performance we've become accustomed to from this accessory. As well as reducing the latency even further from the Note 10, it now supports more remote shortcuts and gestures than ever before, and it's really handy for operating the phone camera via remote control.5G is on board, as the name gives away, but you'd expect that in 2020 and at this price. You get just about everything you could possibly want in a smartphone, bar perhaps a headphone jack: wireless charging, a microSD card slot, an in-screen fingerprint sensor and even AKG-tuned audio, which sounds perfectly fine. The phone comes with Android 10 on board, and the OneUI that Samsung sticks on top of that continues to improve (even if we still prefer the stock Android experience of the Pixels).With a starting price significantly above £1,000/$1,000/AU$1,500, this is not a phone for the faint-hearted. With so many great phones costing significantly less, you're going to really want the best specs and the best screen on the market to think about investing in a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G. The biggest reason to buy the Note 20 Ultra is the same as it's always been with the Note – the stylus you get with it.The S Pen has been fantastic for several years now, and it's better than ever with the new improvements. Add to that a camera that's great, particularly in terms of optical zoom, and you have your two biggest reasons to pick up this phone. It's also absolutely packed with power, has a fantastic, super-sized display, and is really nicely designed too.It's hard to put top-tier smartphones in any kind of order nowadays, as they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. There are plenty of powerful, appealing phones that cost significantly less than the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, and some of them have better battery life and better cameras too. That makes it a tough call as to whether you should spend all that money on this – especially which other Note 20 and Galaxy S20 models to pick from.In the end, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G is the phone for the person who wants everything: a premium design, excellent performance, a really good camera, 5G connectivity and a stylus, all wrapped up in one very expensive package. If that sounds like you, and you have the budget to afford it, you won't be disappointed by what this Samsung flagship has to offer.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-5g
20,Motorola Moto G10,"Motorola Moto G10 review: very cheap, quite basic, definitely capable","If you're looking to buy a very cheap smartphone then this Motorola Moto G10 review is the right place to be.Motorola is renowned for its affordable phones, offering tonnes of different options depending on what exactly you need a phone for. Although they are unlikely to take the top spots as some of the best phones you can buy, they’re no stranger to T3’s guide to the best cheap phones. The Motorola Moto G10 is no different, it’s one of the American manufacturer’s cheapest handsets, and will appeal to those who need a big screen, long-lasting battery and decent camera. You'll have to be willing to make some sacrifices though.Let’s get straight down to it. In this Motorola Moto G10 review, I’ll cover everything you need to know about the smartphone from its price, design and display to its camera and performance.Available now, you can buy the Motorola Moto G10 starting from $176 in the US, £120 in the UK and AU$234 in Australia. That's about as cheap as smartphones can be. Take a look at the widgets on this page for more pricing from across the web.Made predominantly from plastic with thick bezels and a large selfie camera notch on the front, the Motorola Moto G10 does look like a cheap phone. You can buy it in two colourways: grey or pearl, both of which have a ridged textured wave design on the back that takes some getting used to. It does make the phone very grippy and it won’t slide out of your hand as easily as glass phones do. Overall the phone is quite clunky, measuring 165.22 x 75.73 x 9.19mm and weighing around 200g. This isn’t a super slim slab of glass by any means.Alongside the quad-camera system on the back, there’s a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone hidden in the Motorola logo. It’s placed slightly too high up to where your finger would sit naturally but what’s good about it is that it is pretty reliable and works well every time.On the frame, there’s a USB-C charging port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, power button, volume controls and a dedicated Google Assistant button. There's a bottom-ported loudspeaker on the phone, the audio is quite tinny and distorted though so I would recommend sticking to headphones.The 6.5” Max Vision display has a resolution of 1600x720p (HD+). You can’t expect anywhere near the quality you’d get from a more expensive smartphone but it’ll get the job done. For the price, it has a decent IPS display that is clear and bright enough for most everyday uses. It’s also big which is good for streaming video from YouTube or Netflix when you’re out and about.In the box, the phone comes with a clear protective case, USB-C cable and a charging adaptor. The Motorola Moto G10 is IP52 water repellent which means it may not survive a dunk in the bath but should cope with a bit of light rain here and there.A quad camera system sits on the back of the Motorola Moto G10 with a 48MP main lens, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 2MP macro camera and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front, there’s an 8MP selfie camera.  You can see some example shots in the gallery below.Point-and-shoot photos come out looking fine. The cameras can't compete with pricier phones like the Google Pixel 4a or the OnePlus Nord, but it does okay. There was a lot of detail considering, although photos did look quite dull in general and struggled to create a balance between light and dark areas of the shot.Macro photos taken up close to the subject were surprisingly good. Again they lacked vibrancy but overall, they came out looking relatively sharp and would be good enough to use on social media. The zoom function wasn't really worth using though, photos came out looking very grainy, especially at the maximum 8x zoom.Powered by the basic Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chipset, the Motorola Moto G10 packs 4GB of RAM and a choice of either 64GB or 128GB of storage which you can expand using a MicroSD card.Naturally, you won't get super-fast performance from this phone. I found that when there were a few apps open, or when I downloaded several files at once, the phone suffered from lag and it felt sluggish. You won’t want to use this for mobile gaming, but it will be fine to use for messaging, web browsing and a bit of social media networking. Its Geekbench 5 scores back this up scoring 221 in single-core and 1,032 in multi-core which is similar to most other very cheap phones. There’s no 5G or Wi-Fi 6 support here so it’s not particularly future-proofed either but again, that's a given at this price point.A large 5,000mAh battery means that this phone will last you the full day, you won’t need to remember to take a charger with you when you go to work. I ran a video on it over two hours on full brightness and in that time the battery level dropped by 16% suggesting it would have lasted over 12 hours in total, that's good going for such a cheap handset. It comes with a 10W charger in the box, it took about 2 and a half hours to recharge it from empty to 100%.Running on Android 11, Motorola has of the better versions of the operating system. Granted, it’s not as nice to use as the best Samsung phones but it’s still better than some others I've seen. All of the Google apps come pre-installed and you get the benefit of Moto Actions like lift to unlock, swipe to split the screen and the three-finger screenshot, all of which make the phone more efficient and quicker to use.You can't expect to be blown away by a cheap phone, and it's almost certain that you won't be wow-ed by this one either. The Motorola Moto G10 is basic across the board, there are no sophisticated features and it won't deliver knockout performance, but what it does provide is reliability with decent battery life and a durable design.Don't buy this if you play a lot of mobile games, or if you want to take professional-looking photos. But if you just need a smartphone for casual web browsing, texting and calling then this will definitely do the job.If you need a basic phone with a decent display for streaming video, then the Sony Xperia L4 could be a good choice. The 21:9 aspect ratio of the screen makes it good for watching TV shows and movies and makes it useful for multitasking too.The Vivo Y20s is another super-cheap phone worth looking at. Granted the screen is pretty low resolution and the camera isn’t amazing but it is very affordable with long battery life and it looks stylish too.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/motorola-moto-g10-review
21,Apple iPhone XR,"Apple iPhone XR review: a great balance of polish, features and price","Any iPhone XR review in 2021 has to first mention that there have been a number of more advanced iPhones since this was first released including the iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 and most recently the iPhone 13 - so there have been tonnes of new innovations since this phone first hit the scene.So why would you buy it in 2021? Well, the price is lower than it's ever been and the handset still gives you plenty of up-to-date features despite not being the newest of Apple's phones.The iPhone XR starts at £629/AU$849, with 64GB of storage space. For £679/AU$929, you can boost the storage to 128GB. There's no option for 256GB of storage, which the new iPhone SE and iPhone 11 offer.We think the 128GB model is a real sweet spot here – 64GB is enough for anyone at a base level, but 128GB gives you that extra bit of freedom to store photos, videos and music on the phone without things getting shunted to the cloud. For the £50/AU$80 upgrade price, that’s our recommended option.The XR comes in six colours, which we love – plain silver and black are pretty boring by this point. The red is our favourite, but we’re big fans of the yellow and coral too. But you can take your pick, of course. It’s a bit of a shame there’s no gold (though the yellow has a fairly gold-like aluminium edge), but you can’t have everything.The iPhone XR is just about identical to the iPhone 11 (save for the different cameras on the back, and looks extremely close to the iPhone 11 Pro too, but it's actually marginally thicker than the Pro, which is just about noticeable in the hand when you hold them together, but is pretty meaningless in the grand scheme of things.It also has a bigger bezel than that the 11 Pro. The screen still has the curved corners and notch, but with a slightly larger black border around the side.It makes it look not quite as premium as the 11 Pro – the closer the screen comes to the edge, the more futuristic a phone feels – but it’s not a big deal.Sporting the same screen as the iPhone 11, which is a more expensive phone, the iPhone XR has a 6.1-inch LCD Retina display with a resolution of 828x1792.At well over 300 pixels per inch, these screens look sharp and detailed, and they include the P3 wide colour gamut for more vibrant photographs.One of the biggest differences between the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 Pro is the screen. The changes are pretty complex to dig into, so let's lay it out piece by piece.First, let's talk about the 6.1-inch size. The iPhone 11 Pro is 5.8 inches, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max is 6.5 inches.We think the iPhone XR is a great size – it's easier to use one-handed (for someone with admittedly large hands) than the Max, for example. It's closer to the size of the 5.8-inch XS than the Max, and its increase isn't really enough to say that you get a real benefit of going for a bigger screen from that third of an inch. But hey, if you watch videos on your commute, it is still bigger, and every little helps.Interestingly, the iPhone XR and the 11 Pro Max show the same amount of content on-screen. Load up a website and you'll get identical amounts of text. It will be a tad smaller on the XR, obviously, but it means that in many cases, you're not necessarily missing out on viewing space by having this screen compared to the Max's giant display. (You can make on-screen items appear a little larger, if you like.)This also means that you get a bonus here that you don't get on with the iPhone 11 Pro 5.8-inch version – support for split-pane apps in landscape. Certain apps will show more control options when held in landscape on the Max and the XR, but the regular 11 Pro doesn't get them.Now, we don't actually find split-apps to be that groundbreaking when it comes to productivity, but we know some people love them, so if you're using a Plus-sized iPhone now and are ready to upgrade, but don't want to pay the Max's prices, this and the iPhone 11 hit the sweet spot for you.And while the screen of the iPhone XR does look plenty sharp, its resolution is lower than either of the iPhone 11 Pro models (even the smaller one). The iPhone 11 Pro has a 1125x2436 display, while the 11 Pro Max has a 1242x2688 screen (Apple uses what seem to be weird resolutions because they make it easier for developers to make apps that scale across the different screen sizes that iOS supports).The 11 Pro models are both 458ppi, which is obviously a big step up in terms of detail, and there's no denying that the difference is noticeable side-by-side. Photos and movies are clearly sharper on the XS compared to the XR.5.8-inch iPhone on the left, 6.5-inch iPhone in the middle, iPhone XR (6.1 inches) on the right.But if we weren't coming to it from a more expensive, higher-specced phone, it wouldn't bother us.The XR has an LCD screen, while the 11 Pro models use OLED. Generally, OLED is considered the superior technology, because it has a giant contrast range, able to produce images that have subtle detail in dark areas.LCD uses a backlight that shines through the screen, which means dark areas can come out more grey than black. Apple, of course, uses pretty much the best LCD screens on the planet, and it makes the difference in screen tech pretty palatable overall.The iPhone 11 Pro models are also significantly brighter – around 800 nits as standard max brightness rather than 625 nits for the iPhone XR.Related to this is the fact that the 11 Pro models are rated as HDR screens, while the XR isn't (though it can play HDR videos – you just don't get the full benefit). For small peak HDR highlights, the iPhone 11 Pro can even hit 1200 nits, so the difference is significant when watching HDR movies.But while the XR's display is clearly not as nice as the displays in the Pro models, it's a million miles from feeling cheap, or bad.Android phones that are cheaper do have it beaten in some spec areas – a higher resolution and OLED are powerful temptations – but Apple's colour accuracy and clarity of viewing from any angle are second to none, so it's not quite a clear-cut victory for the other phones.Especially since Apple has one more ace up its sleeve: True Tone. We love this feature, which matches the colour temperature of the screen to the ambient light in the room. The idea is that a white image on the screen will look the same as a white piece of paper in the room. So, in a warm indoor light, you don't get a harsh blue light from your phone when everything else is soft yellow.Once you try a phone with it built in, going to anything else feels barbaric.We've talked about video a lot, so let's hear about the sound that goes alongside it. Apple has included stereo speakers here: one at each end of the phone, so when you're holding it in landscape, you get true stereo separation.You can really hear things moving to either side of your head, giving the feeling of being right inside the sound.It's an impressive effect, and is more than just a checkbox on a spec list when you try it, though we know a lot of people will be using their headphones anyway.The speakers are also just generally loud and impressive – great for podcasts and even music if you just don't have a proper speaker to hand. Certainly, crappier portable speakers are unnecessary when your phone blares music out this solidly.The rear camera in the iPhone XS is a wide-angle lens with a 12-megapixel sensor that's bigger than the one you'll find in the new iPhone SE (though is the same resolution – it just lets in more light per pixel by being bigger), but is the same sensor you'll find in the iPhone 11's wide-angle camera.The difference compared to the iPhone 11 or Pro models is that it only has a single lens. The other models all feature an ultra-wide angle lens as well (which is effectively a 0.5x zoom-out), and the Pro models also have a 2x telephoto zoom lens.Having one camera instead of two definitely reduces the flexibility for photography that you have compared to Apple's more expensive phones. The ultra-wide-angle is great for landscapes and buildings, and it also used to enable Night Mode – this takes usable shots in moments when there's way too little light otherwise, and is sadly missing from the iPhone XR (the iPhone 11 and the Pro models include it).And in the iPhone 11 Pro models, the optical zoom adds another way of framing on top, so you can really get the look you want.However, ignoring the zooming options and Night Mode, you still get excellent photos from this camera. The low-light performance is really strong, the Smart HDR feature means you don't have to worry about difficult exposures in scenes that mix light and dark, and the rapid focus and response means you won't miss a shot. Images pack tons of detail even in middling amount of light, and look lifelike.The small downside compared to other iPhones is that the XR uses Apple's previous-generation image processing, while the iPhone SE, iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro all use the latest-generation, so are a little better when it comes to colour reproduction and contrast.The iPhone XR's shot is on the left here, the iPhone XS's is on the right. Subtle shifts in position aside, they're the same. This was taken under kitchen spotlightsThe Portrait Mode on the iPhone XR works just like the iPhone SE and iPhone 11, in that it's all done through detection and computing from a single image (unlike the iPhone 11 Pro, which maps depth using its multiple cameras).This has really impressive results in terms of the quality of picking out the subject and applying blur to the background – we saw crisp lines of focus, and convincing blur across the appropriate parts of person's body as well as the background.But you need to be careful with framing of Portrait shots using this single lens, because if you go for a close-up shot, it can end up distorting things.iPhone XR on the left, iPhone XS Max on the right.You can also the effect above. To get the same framing for these two shots, the iPhone XR had to be held much closer to the face, which is a bit weird and intrusive in itself when taking a photo. But it also results in a slightly bulbous effect, where the nose and face are out of proportion. On the iPhone XS Max (which was released alongside the iPhone XR, and was what we used for our comparison shots), the telephoto lens gives a more proportional representation of features, by being further away.It's a classic issue with wide-angle lenses and nearby objects. It means you may want to take Portrait shots a little further away with the iPhone XR. So let's look at one of those.iPhone XR on the left, iPhone XS Max on the right.We've given it a tough lighting situation: a subject in shade, but with bright sunlight behind. The framing and appearance of the subject in both is fine – the background is a bit different due to the different focal lengths (the photographer stood in different places to take these two shots with matching subject size).The iPhone XR has done a great job making the sky look vibrant on this sunny morning, but the person is a little dark – though there's still good dynamic range in the shadows. However, there's actually more detail in the XR's image when zoomed – a result of the wide-angle lens letting in more light overall than the telephoto lens of the iPhone XR we tested it against.We should also note that the XR's Portrait Mode only works on people, so you can't take pictures of your dog looking majestic, or your favourite cocktail against the sunset, with that background blur. That's the same for the iPhone SE. On the iPhone 11, it will also recognise pets for Portrait Mode shots. On the iPhone 11 Pro, you can take Portrait shots of anything.The front camera picks up light well, but does tend to lose detail compared to the rear one. Portrait Mode works well on it (powered by the 3D-scanning Face ID sensor).Let's finish up with video. It's great that the XR, like the more expensive models, has stereo microphones to record stereo sound in videos. Again, when playing them back on speakers that make the most of the split, it gives you a great sense of being in the location.The XR also has 'extended dynamic range' video, which works like HDR to capture more information in the highlights and shadows. But it's not actually HDR, doesn't conform to HDR standards, and doesn't look different on HDR screens. The idea is to help you capture more detail when shooting the video, and it does a great job at that.Like the Smart HDR stills mode, you can shoot video that mixes bright and dark areas without it looking rubbish. And then video in ideal conditions benefits from this too – you get beautiful detail in light conditions.Overall, it's a very good camera system – it's largely on-par with the iPhone SE, and is a little behind the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro (especially when it comes to the extra flexibility of multiple lenses in the more expensive phones). It's not amazing here in 2020, but it's far from disappointing, either.The iPhone XR uses Apple's A12 processor, which might not be its latest and greatest any more, but Apple lead in this area is so large that it still beats most Android phones. Everything is instantly responsive, and blisteringly fast.The potential for the chip in the iPhone XR is huge – whatever kind of app you want to load it with, from 4K video editing to 3D games, the iPhone XR can handle comfortably.As we said above, this translates into iOS feeling faster than ever – opening apps, switching between them, and just generally going about your business is super-slick.Apple has always put the smoothness of experience over things like customisability or the option to have multiple apps running in split-screen, which can lead people to feel like it's wasting some of that colossal power compared to Android phones, but ultimately the two approaches come down to a matter of personal preference.Newer iPhones are even faster, though you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference in reality.Battery life is impressive in the iPhone XR. It easily lasts a day, generally with a good amount of battery life over, under normal use.The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro have it slightly beaten – and the 11 Pro Max gets a good chunk more of battery again – but not by very much. It's a really reliable performer.The iPhone XR puts up a great fight against its bigger siblings and the Android competition.The iPhone XR sits in a slightly awkward middle ground in Apple's line-up. The iPhone SE starts at £419/$399/AU$679, which is £200/$200/AU$170 cheaper than the iPhone XR and gives you an even more modern processor, a screen and camera of equivalent quality, and the same premium fit and finish.The iPhone SE has a much smaller screen than the XR, and uses fingerprint ID instead of face recognition, but some people may actually prefer those changes. The SE also gives you less battery lifeThe iPhone 11 is £100/$100/AU$150 more than the XR, and gives you a dual-lens camera with newer image processing and Night Mode, plus a little extra battery life and latest-generation Apple chip running it.We think most people will probably look to save themselves a big chunk of money, or will step up to the latest model that gives you a more desirable camera, since that's one of the most important features for lots of us.But the iPhone XR still serves a great purpose. If you want an iPhone that has a big screen and generous battery life, don't mind so much about its camera (which is still very good!), and want to spend mid-range prices only, then it's ideal.If it feels like it would fit the bill for you, we do recommend it – we just think it's worth looking both up and down Apple's range to make sure the other options wouldn't make you little happier, either in price or features.April 2020 – With the release of the iPhone SE and the iPhone XR's drop in price, we've updated this review to reflect its position in the current iPhone line-up, and its value at the lower price.August 2020 – Read our iOS 14 hands-on review to learn about the features coming to iPhone XR in Apple's next update.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/apple-iphone-xr-review
22,Moto G9 Power,Moto G9 Power review: a phone with giant battery power for a small price,"This Moto G9 Power review is likely to interest anyone shopping for the best Android phone on a budget: Motorola has a long history of producing affordable phones with plenty of performance and up-to-date features, this one is no different.Following on from 2020's Moto G8 Power, a phone with a big battery and very reasonable price tag, this new edition has kept to a similar template. The only changes are small tweaks to its appearance and some updates to the internal components. The Moto G9 Power definitely qualifies as one of the best cheap phones of 2021.In our comprehensive T3 review of the Moto G9 Power we'll take an in-depth look at the phone in all the key areas – from battery life to camera performance to the onboard software.The Moto G9 Power was released in November 2020. At launch the handset was given a recommended retail price of £179.99 in the UK, €199.99 across the rest of Europe, and $249.99 in the US.You can the latest prices and contract offers in our price checker below.The Moto G9 Power doesn't deviate too much from the normal Motorola template, though the rectangular rear camera array up in the top left-hand corner on the back of the casing is different from Moto G8 series of phones. It looks as though the current generation of Motorola handsets are all going to follow this new design, and to our eyes it looks rather stylish. The fingerprint sensor sits on the back too, sporting the Motorola logo (face unlock is also available, if you prefer).Otherwise this is quite a standard, plain-looking smartphone. It's easy on the eye but it also has that slightly thicker, slightly cheaper feel that a lot of budget handsets have – while there's nothing majorly offensive about the aesthetics of the Moto G9 Power, you can tell you're not holding something premium like the Galaxy S21 when you pick it up. A green-ish Metallic Sage (as shown off by our review unit) and a purple-ish Electric Violet are your two choices as far as colours go.Aside from the display, the body is all plastic, and we appreciate the slightly textured effect that Motorola has put on the back here – it makes the phone easier to grip when you're holding it, and adds a little bit of polish to the overall design. Motorola describes the G9 Power as ""water-repellent"", so while you don't get any official IP rating for protection against liquids and dust, the phone should be able to survive a few splashes.There are no surprises here in terms of ports or buttons, or where they're placed. The volume and power buttons are on the right as you look at the display of the phone, and on the left you've got the SIM card slot and a dedicated button for Google Assistant (a feature we often find useful). There's a single loudspeaker down at the bottom, alongside a USB-C port for data transfer and charging, and the phone does include a 3.5 mm headphone jack that's sensibly positioned on the front.The only standout feature of the IPS LCD display on the Moto G9 Power is its size: at 6.8 inches it's definitely bigger than most, so those with small hands (or pockets) might want to look elsewhere for their next smartphone. There's a chunky bottom chin, but the other bezels are nice and narrow, and the only interruption to the display is a punch hole notch up in the top left-hand corner of the screen.While the display is certainly big, the 720x1640 pixel resolution means it's not as sharp as a lot of other handsets out there, and we also found the maximum brightness level to be rather underwhelming. It's also worth mentioning that you don't get any HDR processing on the Moto G9 Power display. Everything about the phone needs to be weighed up against it's very affordable price, but the screen is one of the areas where you can tell that Motorola has saved itself some money.The Moto G9 Power has a single 16MP selfie camera on the front and a triple-lens 64MP wide, 2MP macro and 2MP depth rear camera on the back (the fourth circle in the rear camera rectangle is the flash). It's not an overly impressive camera setup – without any ultrawide mode, optical zoom capabilities, or optical image stabilisation – but at the sort of price the phone sells for, it's actually quite a decent offering.The main 64MP camera does a solid job of taking photos for you in good lighting conditions, although the shutter speed is just a touch slower than it is on the very best handsets, and you need a steady hand to get the best shots. A lot of the photos we took with the Moto G9 Power in the daylight came out crisp, bright and vivid, with sharp details and colours that are well balanced. The results are certainly more than good enough for posting to social media.As the light wanes, the shortcomings of the rear camera on the Moto G9 Power start to show up: details get lost and blurred, and there's a lot of noise and pixelation. The photos that you get at night are just about usable, most of the time, but they're a long way from the pictures that you can get in low light from more expensive mid-range phones. This isn't a phone camera that you'd want to rely on to get a great shot in the darkness.There is a night mode available on the camera, but it doesn't do much more than try and boost the brightness of the image as it's captured: it's not really going to pick out any extra detail from the darker areas of your pictures. It's worth mentioning that you do get a few cool photo and video modes with the Motorola software, including a spot colour picture mode and a timelapse video mode, but they're not enough to make up for what is only an average set of cameras overall. The macro mode does have its uses to be fair, and can produce some good results, but you'll need a very steady hand to use it.Battery life is impressive – it's one of the main reasons to buy the Moto G9 Power (as you might have guessed from its name), because there's a 6,000mAh-capacity battery packed in here. With the low-res screen and modest internal components, you can even stretch to multiple days of use with this phone, and the handset is also very good at holding its charge when you're not doing anything with it – it's not going to drain quickly while it's sat in a drawer or on a desk.In a two-hour video streaming test, with the volume set low and the screen brightness ramped up to maximum, the battery level of the Moto G9 Power dipped just 13 percent, from 100 percent to 87 percent – a very decent result, suggesting some 15-16 hours of video streaming overall. No other Motorola phone has had a battery this big in it before (it's actually one of the biggest phone batteries you'll find from any manufacturer right now, and it really makes a difference. There's no wireless charging here however, and the wired charging speed tops out at 20W.You certainly aren't going to be buying the Moto G9 Power for its performance: this phone will run everything in the Google Play Store, but more demanding apps will be sluggish, and the most intense games will still have sub-par frame rates even when you've dialled down the graphics quality settings as much as you can. It's certainly possible to get by with the G9 Power, but it's not for serious gamers or power users.The Geekbench 5 scores of 315 (single-core), 1411 (multi-core) and 374 (OpenCL) backs that up – those benchmarks are significantly lower than phones like the Moto G 5G Plus, and are blown away by top-end handsets such as the OnePlus 8 Pro. The slow speed doesn't make the phone unusable, but any slower and it would start to get frustrating as far as the user experience goes. That's worth bearing in mind if you think that the Moto G9 Power could be your next handset.In terms of specifics, the phone is powered by a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor, alongside 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage (which you can expand with a memory card if you need to). There's no 5G here, but then you wouldn't really expect it at this price, and the majority of us should be able to get by with 4G speeds for the next few years anyway. The latest Wi-Fi 6 tech is missing too, but again that's not really a dealbreaker at this stage.As usual with Motorola, the Moto G9 Power comes with a clean and unfussy version of Android that's pretty close to the stock version that Google puts on its own phones. While the handset comes running Android 10 rather than the very latest Android 11, it is one of the better Android skins on the market at the moment, with very little in the way of bloat – maybe another reason to choose a Motorola phone (the Android phones pushed out by the Chinese manufacturers tend to be less impressive in this area, for example).The phone does support customisable gestures, so you can trigger actions like taking a screenshot or turning on the flashlight through certain movements of your hands and fingers – perhaps not the most compelling of features on a phone, but it's something else to take note of. One of our favourites is being able to flip over the phone face down on a surface and have the Do Not Disturb mode turn on automatically.It's all about the value for money as far as performance on the Moto G9 Power is concerned. By many metrics you're really getting the bare minimum needed in terms of specs to properly run an Android smartphone, but the handset has just about enough oomph that it's satisfactorily speedy for day-to-day use, and for the majority of games. Overall it's probably better than you might expect considering the price that you're paying for the phone, which is all you can really ask for.It's always difficult delivering a verdict on a budget phone such as the Moto G9 Power, because these handsets are obviously not as good as their more expensive competitors – but they are very affordable, and for a lot of people buying a new smartphone, that's a very important consideration. As you would expect from Motorola, the Moto G9 Power delivers a lot of value for money.You'll struggle to find a phone cheaper than this today that isn't seriously compromised in terms of performance and features, and everything else about the phone needs to be weighed up with that in mind: the somewhat lacklustre screen, the so-so internal components, the average camera performance in low light, and so on. At the end of the day the Moto G9 Power will do everything you need a smartphone to do, so maybe the question is why you would pay any more?Besides the low price of the Moto G9 Power, the other main reason to put this device top of your shopping list is that 6,000mAh battery, which means the phone just keeps going and going. It's one of the best phones on the market at the moment in terms of battery life, though with fast charging and wireless charging now so widespread, battery life is perhaps not the major consideration that it once was.One of the issues with choosing the Moto G9 Power as your next smartphone is that there are so many good rival handsets around. Okay, phones like the iPhone SE 2020 and the OnePlus Nord might be double the price of the G9 Power, but they're still on the affordable side – and they're a lot better than the Motorola in terms of design, screen quality, performance, photo and video taking, and so on. Phones like the Nokia 5.4 and the Xiaomi Redmi 9 give Motorola plenty of competition at the budget level too.Whether this is the phone for you is going to depend largely on what you're going to be using your smartphone for: if you need the very best in night photography and are going to be spending a lot of your time on the most demanding games that Android has to offer, then it might be worth saving up until you can afford a more expensive purchase. If you just need a phone that'll cover the basics and last and last on a single battery charge, then the Moto G9 Power might be the phone for you.Overall, we came away mostly impressed with what the Moto G9 Power had to offer – it's certainly one of the best budget Android phones on the market at the moment, and when you consider the low, low price that it's going for, it's hard to complain too much about the various shortcomings of the phone. It certainly isn't going to do Motorola's reputation as a leading budget handset maker any damage at all.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/moto-g9-power-review
23,Sony Xperia L4,Sony Xperia L4 review: basic across the board,"This Sony Xperia L4 review will cover everything you need to know - from its design and display to its camera, battery life and performance. If it's not the right phone for you, take a look at the last section where I'll offer up some similarly priced alternatives.Sony has long been a big name in smartphone manufacturing, its flagship devices often feature in T3’s guide to the best phones, boasting excellent cameras paired with tall, slender, high-quality displays that are ideal for streaming video.The Sony Xperia L4 takes those ideas and scales them back, offering something much more affordable and much more basic. It’s not the best cheap phone you can buy, but it’s a good option for those who are on a very tight budget.You can buy the Sony Xperia L4 from Amazon for £169 in the UK and AU$232 in Australia. You can’t currently buy this handset in the US.The Sony Xperia L4 was released back in 2020 and heads up their most budget range of smartphones. Just like some of its more expensive counterparts, the Sony Xperia L4 has a slender design with a 21:9 aspect ratio giving you widescreen viewing and multi-window functionality. It has improved on 2019’s Sony Xperia L3 with a bigger, better quality screen, more storage, a new 5MP wide camera and a more powerful battery.You can always tell when you’re looking at a Sony phone, whether it’s one of their budget offerings or their all-singing, all-dancing flagship, the Sony Xperia 1 II. What they have in common is a long, slim 21:9 design that makes them stand out against the usual 16:9 slabs of glass offered by other manufacturers.The Sony Xperia L4 is no different. It has a 6.2inch display with slim bezels and a selfie snapper in the notch towards the top of the phone. Measuring 159 x 71 x 8.7mm and weighing only 178g, it’s comfortable to hold and use with one hand, even if yours are on the smaller side like mine.When you turn the phone over, there’s no camera module sticking out at all, the lenses are integrated into the casing which makes it stable to use on a table, and effortless to slide into pockets. Made from plastic, the back feels strong and durable, even though it looks less premium than glass would have done. You can choose to buy the Sony Xperia L4 in blue or black.On the frame, there are the usual volume controls and power button as well as a side-mounted fingerprint sensor and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The placement of the power button isn’t that intuitive, I kept pressing the fingerprint sensor by mistake.The screen has a resolution of 1680x720p HD+ so you can’t really expect top-tier display quality here. It does look clear and vivid but lacks the precision and detail of more expensive handsets, this is most noticeable in text. It’s not particularly bright either, you might struggle to see it on sunny days. There's also no HDR10 support. Despite that, it is great for streaming TV shows and movies thanks to the 21:9 aspect ratio. This is definitely a phone for keeping you entertained on your commute.The Sony Xperia L4 has a pretty basic camera system with a 13MP main camera, a 5MP ultrawide lens and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front, there’s an 8MP selfie snapper.You’ll get the best shots from the camera during the day. Producing clear, bright photos with plenty of detail and accurate colours, the cameras are definitely capable as long as you're in good lighting. On a more dreary day, I thought there could have been a better balance between light and dark areas as overall the scene looked quite bland.When it comes to photos in very low light, the camera doesn’t fare so well. It's not able to brighten the scene enough, instead, leaving it looking dark and even slightly grainy. In all honestly, if it's social media-worthy shots you're after, the ultrawide mode and 4x zoom won't really be worth your time either.As you can see from the gallery above, the Sony Xperia L4's cameras can produce some great photos and some that aren't so great. It'll mostly be about making sure you have the right lighting.A Mediatek MT6762 chipset powers the phone, along with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You can expand on it using a MicroSD card.The Sony Xperia L4's performance was basic. It coped with casual everyday tasks like web browsing and messaging, but sometimes got warm and slow while working hard to load mobile games.Its Geekbench 5 scores reflect that, scoring only 146 in single-core and 880 in multi-core. Those are some of the lowest scores I’ve seen. If you’re after speed then this isn’t where you’ll find that. There’s no 5G or Wi-Fi 6  so you won’t have access to the fastest possible internet either.You may have to recharge the Sony Xperia L4 a couple of times a day, especially if you’re someone who uses your phone a lot. Under the hood sits a 3,580mAh battery, which is smaller than most recent phones at any price. To test it out, I played a local video for two hours on full brightness. In that time, the battery level dropped by 22% that would suggest the phone would have lasted about 9 hours of video in total. To recharge the phone back up again, it took just under two hours to go from empty to 100%. That's okay, it means you won't be waiting around forever.Running Android 9 Pie, the Sony Xperia L4 feels very intuitive to use, it’s definitely one of the nicer versions of Android out there. There aren’t loads of unnecessary apps when you first boot it up and it comes with Google’s suite pre-installed. There are some handy extras as well, like the multi-window function which means you can run two apps at once by splitting the screen into two. You'll also be able to minimise the display, making it easier to use with one hand when you need to.If you like the idea of a smaller phone and you aren’t keen on spending loads of money, then the Sony Xperia L4 is a decent choice. Granted mobile gamers should steer clear, but most people will get on well with its intuitive operating system and its camera which does okay in comparison to other cheap phones.You can’t expect the best of the best when you’re spending so little on a phone, and that rings true when it comes to the Sony Xperia L4 which has made some sacrifices to keep the cost low. While you won’t get it all, you will get the classic Sony smartphone experience - an immersive handset that is comfortable to hold and very easy to use.If battery life is a deal-breaker for you, then maybe consider the Moto G9 Power instead. It has a similar price tag to the Sony Xperia L4 but its battery is 6,000 mAh and should last for more than 15 hours of video playback. That’s pretty impressive for a cheap phone.It could be worth considering spending a little bit more if you’re someone who wants a more well-rounded device. The OnePlus Nord is only a little bit more expensive yet managed to score very highly in all the key areas – camera, performance, battery life, design, screen and software experience. It’s one of the best Android phones you can buy for less than $300.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/sony-xperia-l4-review
24,OnePlus Nord N10 5G,OnePlus Nord N10 5G review: more mid-range value from OnePlus,"If you've landed on this OnePlus Nord N10 5G review then you're probably on the hunt for a reasonably priced smartphone, and trust me, there's no better time than the present.As materials get cheaper and technology gets cleverer, more and more affordable phones are coming along that prove you don't need to spend big to get yourself a decent smartphone. The cheap to mid-range market is booming and OnePlus is one of the manufacturers leading the revolution.They've fast become well-known for their extremely capable cheaper phones, the OnePlus Nord was released back in July 2020 and has since been a prime example, with the OnePlus Nord 2 cementing the fact.With the Nord N10 5G, OnePlus decreased the price even further – naturally meaning more compromises in features and performance, but for a phone that won't cost you so much. Of course, for many phone buyers, a compromise is expected in this price range.There's also the OnePlus Nord N100, which undercuts both the first Nord and the Nord N10 5G substantially – it'll cost you just £179. If you're shopping to a really tight budget, the Nord N100 might suit you better, but for everyone else the Nord N10 5G is worth a look.For a start it offers 5G connectivity – as the name gives away – and you also get a large, 90Hz refresh rate display and a quad-lens rear camera. Is the Nord N10 5G the right pick for your next upgrade? Our in-depth review should help you decide one way or the other.The OnePlus Nord N10 5G is out now and available direct from OnePlus, SIM-free, for £329. Unlike the original Nord, it's coming to the US too, but OnePlus hasn't yet revealed exactly when that's going to be or how much it will cost.The OnePlus Nord N10 5G has the same feel in the hand as a lot of phones down at this price point: slightly chunkier than the more expensive phones, with a cheaper, plastic feel to the touch. That's not to say that it's a bad-looking phone, just that you can tell it's not one of the top-tier handsets that's going to cost you significantly more.Apart from the chin, which is a bit thicker, the bezels are pleasingly thin, and the 6.49-inch, 1080 x 2400 pixel LCD display is nice and bright and vivid (you can adjust the colour temperature as well as the brightness). It's also worth pointing out that the screen has an above-average refresh rate of 90Hz, which means super-smooth scrolling and gaming.There's no water or dust resistance here in order to keep costs down, and it's a shame that OnePlus has also dropped the dedicated mute switch that we've got used to from other handsets made by the company. We do have a headphone jack here, which is something we still appreciate, and there's just one dark blue colour option called Midnight Ice.You've got a punch hole notch on the front for the selfie camera, a tidy rear camera array in the top left corner on the back, and a fingerprint sensor around the rear too (it's not under the display, as it is with the OnePlus Nord). It's a solid if unspectacular phone in terms of its design, and just about what you'd expect for the price.As well as a single 16MP selfie camera, the OnePlus Nord N10 5G also comes with a quad camera, 64MP+8MP+2MP+2MP setup on the rear – that's a wide lens, an ultrawide lens, a macro lens and a monochrome lens. The ultrawide option is always handy of course, but there's no optical zoom. Video can be recorded at 4K up to 30 frames per second.The quality of shots you get from the rear camera is fine, really, without troubling the likes of the Pixel 4a (one of the best phones at this price point in terms of camera quality). Like a lot of phones at this price, pictures in daylight look good and bright and sharp, although some blurring and noise is visible in certain shots if you look closely – it's a picture quality that's definitely decent enough for social media shots, but not much beyond that.At night, as you would expect, more problems start to appear: more noise, more blurring, and more loss of detail. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G does have a night mode on its camera, which helps a bit (and it's pretty quick in terms of shutter speed too), but it won't work wonders. You can get some good shots at night, if there's some illumination available, and overall the camera performance is about on a par for something at this price.In our two-hour video streaming test – at maximum brightness, a low volume, and a 60Hz refresh rate – the battery dropped from 100 percent to 78 percent, which means you should get about 9-10 hours of watching overall. Day-to-day use was impressive, with the battery easily lasting a day and sometimes much further, depending on usage – this isn't a phone where you're going to have to panic about finding a mains socket, and the 30W fast charging (for a 70 percent charge in half an hour) is useful too.There's just one configuration of the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, which is a Snapdragon 690 5G chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage (which you can expand via a microSD card if you want to). That's some way short of the best mid-rangers on the market but also significantly better than the specification that you'll get if you're shopping right down at the budget end of the market.While you will see dropped frames in some of the more demanding mobile games, such as the Asphalt racing games and Fortnite, you can play all these games and run any app you like to an acceptable level – as Geekbench 5 scores of 608 (single-core), 1781 (multi-core), and 975 (OpenCL) would suggest. While there's little in the way of lag or stuttering, apps and websites do sometimes take an extra millisecond or four to load up.We should give another nod in the direction of the OxygenOS software that OnePlus puts on top of Android, because we think it's one of the better manufacturer operating systems out there. From the design of the fonts and visuals, to the slickness of the apps such as the file manager to the messaging client, it's a polished product (you can of course use the Google alternatives if you prefer).However, the Nord N10 5G runs Android 10, not Android 11 like the flagship OnePlus 8T. OnePlus says it will get updated to Android 11 eventually, but not beyond that, and security updates are guaranteed for two years rather than the three years you get with the more premium OnePlus handsets (including the OnePlus Nord).The biggest problem for the OnePlus Nord N10 5G is the original OnePlus Nord, which at the time of writing is just £50 more expensive in the UK (check the widgets on this page for the latest deals) – the first Nord has a more premium feel, a superior display, and a better camera, so it's worth the price premium.As well as saving yourself some cash, you might pick the OnePlus Nord N10 5G instead for its slightly larger screen and its slightly better performing battery... and that's about it. It feels like most people are going to opt for the more expensive Nord, as there isn't the same substantial price gap as there is to the OnePlus Nord N100.Take the original OnePlus Nord out of the equation though – which you're going to have to do if you live in the US – and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G is a perfectly capable, very affordable, 5G-ready mobile phone. You still get plenty of smartphone in return for your money, even if the handset does have its fair share of weaknesses.The Nord range in general and the Nord N10 5G in particular sees OnePlus stretching out across more price points and into more territories – with that in mind it's perhaps inevitable that some of the OnePlus quality and innovation is going to get stretched pretty thin. The bottom line is you've got respectable performance, a decent camera, and reliably long battery life for a very fair price.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review

5G: YesTo sum up this Samsung Galaxy S21 5G review: if you want a flagship phone but you're not keen on paying over the odds, this phone is a no-brainer.Samsung kickstarted 2021 with the highly anticipated launch of the Samsung Galaxy S21 series. Since then, it has proved to be a winner. Not only are they the best Samsung phones so far, but they’ve also all ranked towards the top of T3’s guides to the best Android phones, and the best phones overall. One even took a slot in the list of the best gaming phones you can buy.Shortly after January's Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event which took place during CES, we got our hands on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra which picked up a 5-star rating, it was later crowned the Best Phone at the T3 Awards 2021. Not long after that, I tested out the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus which I rated 4 stars. Both had plenty to boast about including stunning screens and feature-packed cameras, as well as eye-watering price tags to match.Not everyone wants to fork out $1,000 or more on a phone though, and I can’t blame them, especially considering most of us keep a phone for a couple of years before upgrading again. The Samsung Galaxy S21 5G is the cheapest in the range, and while it may not be the leader of the pack, it has certainly been one to watch this year. It's a scaled-back version of the phone, which ultimately makes it cheaper and much more accessible.This video runs through the entire Samsung Galaxy S21 range, explaining the key specs and features of each phone.Directly from Samsung, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G is available with 128GB of storage for $799.99 in the US, £769 in the UK and AU$1,099 in Australia. You can also buy it with 256GB storage for $849.99 / £819 / AU$1,199. To see more prices from around the web, take a look at the widgets on this page.When it comes to outlining what's new about the phone, the first thing to say is that the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G is a couple of hundred dollars cheaper at launch than its predecessor was, so naturally, there have been some adjustments to make that possible.Samsung has refreshed the look and feel of the phone, getting rid of the curved screen and standalone rear camera notch on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S20, replacing it with a flat display with a camera module that's integrated into the frame. I’m not convinced it actually looks better, I prefer the design of the Galaxy S20, but that’s for you to decide. Elsewhere, the resolution of the display is lower than it was before going from 1440 x 3200p (QHD) down to 1080 x 2400p (FHD+) although Samsung has kept the 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support.Other than that, the phones are largely the same. The camera hardware is pretty much identical, and despite having different chipsets, their processing power is similar too. Both phones use a 4,000mAh battery and 25W charging, as well as having the potential for wireless charging. So whether the newer handset is an improvement on its predecessor or not is debatable.As you would expect from Samsung, the Galaxy S21 5G is a good-looking phone. Three camera lenses sit on the back, the module seamlessly wraps around the corner of the phone as if a part of the frame, as opposed to sticking out of the back casing. It comes in three colourways: grey, white, violet and the version I’ve been testing out is pink.The glass back on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has been replaced with plastic on this phone. It makes it feel less premium yet will definitely make it more durable in the long run. To boost the overall look of the phone it does have a glittery sheen on it, but even so, it’s quite clear this is an area Samsung has saved some money on.One thing I really like about this phone is its size, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G measures 15.17 x 7.12 x 0.79 cm and weighs 169g which suits my smaller hands well. That means it happily slips into pockets and doesn’t stick out like so many other smartphones.On the front, the flat 6.2-inch screen has a hole-punch style selfie camera centred along the top with super-slim bezels around the sides. Like all of Samsung’s phones, you’ve got a USB-C port, volume controls and power button placed around the frame. There’s still no 3.5mm headphone jack, that’s only really worth knowing if you’re still clinging onto your old wired headphones, though.The display resolution of both the Samsung Galaxy S21 and the S21 Plus is now down to Full HD+ so the only phone in this series that has a better quality screen is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra which has a WQHD display. Full HD+ is enough to suit most people, it doesn't give you the wow factor but you have to make sacrifices somewhere if you want a flagship-tier smartphone for a more mid-range price.Even on this base version of the phone, you still get the 120Hz refresh rate. The screen is a complete pleasure to use, it’s silky smooth to swipe, tap and scroll on. Streaming video from the likes of Netflix has depth and plenty of colours thanks to HDR10+ support, and with 1,300 nits peak brightness, it’s visible even in bright sunlight.Unlocking the handset can either be done through a password, facial recognition or the in-display fingerprint sensor. With masks blocking my face whenever I’m out and about, I always opt for the fingerprint and Samsung’s is one of the best, working consistently and quickly every time.The camera module on the back houses a 12MP main lens, a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 64MP telephoto lens, on the front there’s a 10MP selfie camera.That’s the same as the Galaxy S20, but what’s new is a range of shooting modes like Zoom Lock to stabilise the shot as you zoom in or Director’s View which shoots videos from the front and rear cameras simultaneously.As you can see in the gallery above, shots in daylight come out looking clear and bright. They're well exposed and well balanced if a tad oversaturated at times. Shots close up to the subject have loads of intricate detail, while cityscapes don't feel too busy because there's plenty of depth. You don't get anywhere near the level of precision as you do from the S21 Ultra yet you don't get left feeling hard done by after snapping shots on this camera either.When it comes to the zoom, being able to shoot based on the Zoom Lock makes things much more stable above 20x zoom. The shots aren't really usable but for picking up information further than the human eye can see, it is very useful and much more effective than what most other phones offer.Shots in low light are better than they used to be on the Galaxy S20, a welcome improvement that you'll actually make use of a lot if you're the type to take lots of photos when you're out and about in the evening.You do get a lot for your money with the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G’s camera system[CPU]Single-Core Score: 716Multi-Core Score: 3,464[Compute]OpenCL: 6,731Vulkan: 5,885Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G packs the Exynos 2100 chipset, alongside 8GB RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. In some other international regions, the phone uses the Qualcomm SM8350 Snapdragon 888. Unlike previous generations of the Galaxy phones, there’s no MicroSD card slot to expand the storage.Matching up to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus, the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G achieved Geekbench 5 scores of 716 in single-core and 3,464 in multi-core, with 6,731 in OpenCL. That’s close to similarly priced handsets like the OnePlus 8 Pro and even pricier handsets like the Oppo Find X3 Pro. It’s actually not that far off the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra’s scores either. So despite not being the absolute fastest option out there, this is still a speedy smartphone that will cope with everything from photo editing to mobile gaming without any problems at all.The battery is the same size as in its predecessor that being 4,000mAh - I tested it out by running a local video for two hours on full brightness. In that time the battery level dropped by 14% suggesting that it would have lasted over 14 hours in total. So it'll easily last the whole day and then some. 25W fast charging means it charged up pretty quickly as well, although there's no wall charger in the box, you just get the cable. It does support wireless charging too.Running on Android 11, you’re sure the get the best user experience there is. Everything is simple, smooth and it looks good. With mostly just Google and Samsung's own apps pre-installed, there’s no wasted time with unnecessary apps. You’ll also have access to Samsung DeX which extends your phone into a desktop experience through a wired or wireless connection. As well as displaying your phone onto a bigger screen, it can also help to make file transfers even easier between your phone and your PC.Ultimately, if you already own the Samsung Galaxy S20 5G, then it’s really not going to be worth the upgrade to the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G. They’re just not different enough to make it worth it.For anyone looking to upgrade from another phone though, it will definitely be worth it. You get a great camera, long battery life, speedy performance and the best Android experience from a flagship phone that doesn't cost the earth.Some might be put off by the plastic design, and not everyone will be a fan of the lower quality display but for most those will be minor downsides in an otherwise fantastic phone. If you aren’t willing to spend above the odds then this really is the obvious choice.For a bigger screen and a bigger battery, you should look towards the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. Or, if you’re after the very best of everything, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is where you’ll find that.Another phone with a similar price tag you should consider is the OnePlus 9, it’s similar in terms of performance and display quality but has a bigger screen and more flashy design than you get here, as well as a slightly more sophisticated camera system.For a phone with more of a focus on display quality, consider the Sony Xperia 1 II. Its 6.55inch screen is razor-sharp with balanced colours, it’s a fantastic handset for watching TV shows and movies on your commute. Plus, the camera is excellent.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-review

5G: YesIn this OnePlus Nord CE 5G review, I’ll take you through everything you need to know about their latest handset. From its design and display to the camera, performance, and ultimately whether this smartphone is a good choice for you, or not.The marketplace for cheap and mid-range phones is growing. Not everyone is keen to spend upwards of $800 on one of the very best phones that they’ll only keep for a couple of years anyway. Nowadays you don’t need to spend loads to get a decent phone, the quality of more affordable options has increased dramatically over the past few years, you just need to take a look at T3’s guide to the best cheap phones to know that.After having plenty of success with the OnePlus Nord, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer is back with a stripped-down version of the handset, that cuts a few corners to save on price, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G.Launched in June 2021, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G is available now starting from £299 for the 8GB RAM, 128GB storage version. You can also buy it with 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage for £369. That’s cheaper than the OnePlus Nord was at launch. At the moment, there’s no official pricing for the US or Australia.The OnePlus Nord CE 5G, or Core Edition, is a more stripped back handset than the OnePlus Nord. Firstly it has a plastic casing as opposed to the Corning Gorilla Glass seen on the Nord. The CE also only has three rear camera lenses, down from four on the original, as well as a single 16MP front camera as opposed to dual selfie cameras. Those are really the main differences though, both have a similar-sized FHD screen and a similar processor. Improving on its predecessor, the new OnePlus Nord CE 5G actually has a bigger battery and a lighter build.The build is one of the main talking points of the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. It’s seriously slim and super light, measuring 159.2 x 73.5 x 7.9mm and weighing just 170g. That makes it easy to use one-handed,  and perfect for anyone who prefers a smaller phone. Available in three colours, Blue Void, Charcoal Ink, and Silver Ray - the plastic casing has a matte finish and doesn’t seem to pick up fingerprint marks very easily.The back of the phone houses a slim rounded camera module with three lenses. On the front, the display is only interrupted by a hole punch camera in the top left corner. One of the big changes is that you no longer get a Corning Gorilla glass display, so it could potentially be more prone to damage than the screen on the OnePlus Nord.Unlike a lot of other phones, you still get the 3.5mm headphone jack on the frame. That sits next to a USB-C charging port. In terms of buttons, the OnePlus Nord CE 5G keeps things simple, there’s just the power button and two volume controls. OnePlus has gotten rid of the slider which is a shame because it was something that made the phone just a little bit different from the rest. Overall this is a good-looking phone. It may not feel as solid and premium to the touch as the OnePlus Nord did, but it definitely looks the part. You also get a clear protective case included in the box.A 6.43-inch edge-to-edge AMOLED display stretches across the front of the phone. It has a resolution of 2400 x 1080p and a 90Hz refresh rate, not much has changed from the OnePlus Nord but it didn’t really need to. It feels sleek and smooth to tap, swipe and scroll on, and HDR10+ support means you’ll get a good experience streaming video from the likes of Netflix. So although it’s hardly going to match up to the most expensive phones on the market like the best Samsung phones, it does hold its own very well in the cheap handsets crowd. Bright, sharp and clear, you don’t get much better at this price point.A three-lens camera system sits on the back of the phone, with a 64MP main lens, an 8MP ultrawide lens and a 2MP mono lens. Although admittedly, I'm not sure I see much point in a dedicated monochrome lens. On the front, there’s a 16MP selfie camera. You can see some of the shots I took on the OnePlus Nord CE 5G in the gallery below.Photos taken on a bright sunny day came out looking well-balanced, bright and colourful. Look a little closer and you’ll see they lack some finer detail, and actually slightly exaggerate colour too. It’s hardly going to rival the leaders of the pack, the OnePlus 9 series, but the quality of point-and-shoot images is fine for a cheap smartphone. In fact, they’re slightly better than other handsets at this price. In the right lighting, you can take some pretty solid shots even.The front camera was great for snapping selfies, the colours looked accurate and it managed to pick up plenty of definition. So if you’re buying this for your kids, or if you take lots of front-facing shots yourself, you’ll be able to take some good ones with the OnePlus Nord CE 5G.A mid-range chipset powers the OnePlus Nord CE 5G. That being the Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G, and with it comes 5G so you’ll get the fastest internet speeds possible if your area supports it. You can choose between 8GB RAM/128GB storage and 12GB RAM/256GB storage - it’s worth knowing that you can’t expand it using a MicroSD card.Day-to-day the handset coped well with most tasks and even handled some mobile gaming. You do have to expect some shortcomings when it comes to performance, it did sometimes suffer from a little lag but most won’t even notice that. Falling slightly behind the OnePlus Nord in its Geekench 5 scores, the One Plus Nord CE 5G got 440 in single-core and 1,775 in multi-core. Hardly super-speedy but that’s about the same as other similarly priced phones like the Realme 8 Pro or the Oppo Find X3 Lite.Packing a large 4,500 mAh battery meant that you’ll get loads of juice from each charge, easily lasting the whole day, if not more. I ran a video on it over two hours on full brightness, in that time the battery level dropped by 12% suggesting it would have lasted almost 17 hours all in all. That’s very impressive, you’d expect that long a battery life in a phone triple the price. Included in the box is a Warp Charge 30T Plus, it managed to charge the phone from empty to 100% in just over an hour so you should never be caught short.Running OxygenOS 11 which is based on Android 11, the software feels smooth and intuitive. It’s not quite as nice to use as pure Android, yet it’s really not that far off either. You get all the usual Google apps pre-installed, OnePlus hasn’t filled it up with loads of unnecessary apps you’ll just end up deleting. On this version of the operating system, OnePlus has improved the Dark Mode, Zen Mode, and included a new always-on display so the screen wakes up when you pick it up.Okay so the OnePlus Nord CE 5G isn’t particularly game-changing and I wouldn’t say it’s a better phone than the original Nord. In fact, it risks blending in against the masses of competition with its cheaper build and simpler design. But in saying that, anyone who wants to spend a bit less, needs a reliable battery and wants a decent display should definitely add this to their shortlist.If you’re on a budget, this phone doesn’t make too many compromises. It does take a bit of a hit in performance, but it’s really nothing dramatic and the phone will be able to cope with normal everyday tasks like texting and social media.The main draw of this phone is the price, and because of that, it's unlikely you're expecting a powerhouse anyway. Overall I'd say you get what you pay for, and maybe just a little bit more.A similarly priced phone worth considering is the Google Pixel 4a, it may not be their newest phone but it’s still extremely capable. The camera is where it really thrives, plus any Android lover will be more than pleased with the software. You can also choose to buy it with 5G if that’s important to you.Looking to go even cheaper? The Vivo Y20s is a super cheap phone and one of the best you can buy at that price. Naturally, given the fact that it’s half the price of the OnePlus Nord CE 5G, its screen isn’t as good and it could be a little slow in comparison, but overall it's a decent phone that will do the job.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-nord-ce-5g-review
27,Motorola Moto E6 Plus,"Motorola Moto E6 Plus review: cheap smartphone, basic features","In this Motorola Moto E6 Plus review, I’ll take you through everything you need to know about this affordable smartphone from its design and display to the camera and performance.Motorola has done a great job to cement itself as a trusted and affordable smartphone manufacturer, in fact, their handsets are regularly featured in T3’s guide to the best cheap phones.Their most budget range, the Moto E series, offers cheap handsets with basic specs and features. Sitting within the sixth generation of the phones, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus has a 6.1inch display, a two-lens rear camera system and a fingerprint sensor. Let’s get straight down to it, here’s the full Motorola Moto E6 Plus review.The Motorola Moto E6 Plus was launched back in 2019, so is now available from lots of retailers for really competitive prices. At the time of writing, you can pick the phone up for as little as $54 in the US and £80 in the UK. Take a look at the widgets for more recent pricing.It’s safe to say that this is a seriously cheap phone, but how does it differ from the other handsets in the Moto E6 series, those being the Moto E6 and the Moto E6 Play?The Moto E6 has the same processor and 6.1inch HD+ display, but the Moto E6 Plus improves on it with a better camera system. The Moto E6 Play, on the other hand, is a smaller phone with a 5.5inch display with a lower resolution and a more basic processor. All three handsets are cheap with 32GB storage and 2GB RAM. The Moto E6 series was later followed by the Moto E7 series.In taking the Motorola Moto E6 Plus out of the box, the first thing I noticed was just how light it was to hold. Measuring 155.6 x 73.06 x 8.6mm and weighing just 150g, it feels like a small phone but manages to pack in a pretty big display.The phone doesn’t come with the battery installed, you’ll have to pull off the back cover to slot it in before you can use it. I found the back to be pretty stiff and it took me a while to successfully get it off. It also felt a little flimsy, like you could easily snap the plastic casing on the back whilst trying to remove it. In the box, you get a clear plastic protective case which makes it feel more sturdy, which might give you a bit more peace of mind.The Motorola Moto E6 Plus is available in two colours, Polished Graphite (silver) and Bright Cherry (red). I saw the silver version, the shiny finish made it look like a more premium device than it is, although admittedly because of its largely plastic design, it is prone to fingerprint marks.  I found myself constantly trying to wipe it clean. It has thick bezels and a black-framed hole-punch camera on the front. On the back, there are two camera lenses integrated into the casing and a fingerprint sensor in the middle, which works quickly to unlock the display. On the frame is a 3.5mm headphone jack, a power button and volume controls as well as a Mini USB charging port.With a 6.1inch HD+ display, the 1560 x 720p resolution is hardly flagship-level quality and you won’t be able to stream video in Full HD. If you are looking to spend less than £100 on a phone, then it’s likely you aren’t expecting an ultra-clear screen anyway. It’s as good as you will get at this price. It is relatively sharp and well-defined and it was bright enough to see on a sunny day. The colours weren’t entirely accurate but that won’t be too apparent for day-to-day tasks.Onto the camera, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus has a 13MP main rear camera paired with a 2MP depth sensor, the front selfie camera is 8MP. As with any budget handset, the camera won’t produce photography with award-winning detail and clarity, yet its point-and-shoot photography was actually alright.Pictures came out looking bright with decent colouring which in the right conditions could easily produce decent shots to use on social media. If you look more closely though, colours did look a little dull and the camera struggled to balance the light and dark areas of the shot. If you zoom into the photos, you’ll also see that lines look a little blurred and finer details are grainy. So despite being surprisingly alright for a cheap phone, the two-lens camera system definitely had flaws. See the gallery below for some examples of shots taken on the Motorola Moto E6 Plus.There’s no dedicated night mode here, but it does have an LED flash to illuminate scenes at night. In comparison to other handsets, there isn’t that much to play around with, Motorola has kept the different camera modes to a minimum, with Bokeh, Panorama and Face Beauty being the only options to choose from. In terms of video, you can film in resolutions up to FHD. They came out looking shaky, dark and grainy, though.Using the MediaTek Helio P22 mid-range chip and 2GB RAM, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus is unlikely to blow you away with speedy performance. Considering its price it manages to hold its own yet won't be a good choice for anyone who spends a lot of time on their phone. In Geekbench 5, the Moto E6 Plus scored 138 in single-core and 482 in multi-core. What that tells you is the performance is certainly that of a very budget phone, you won’t be able to play larger mobile games, but it will get you through basic everyday tasks.To store all of your files and photos, it only has 32GB storage but you can expand it using a MicroSD card. As you might expect from such an affordable phone, there’s no 5G or WiFi 6 to give you super-fast internet, nor is there NFC to make contactless payments.The 3,000mAh battery is unlikely to provide days and days of battery life either. I ran a video on full brightness over two hours, in that time the battery dropped by 38% so would have lasted around five hours in total. That’s quite low in comparison to the 15+ hours provided by some flagships. You also can’t expect to get fast charging, it only comes with a 5W Mini USB charger which took just under four hours to recharge the phone from empty to 100%.Running on Android 9, the Motorola Moto E6 Plus has a comfortable and familiar Android experience. It comes with a few useful apps pre-installed, like Google Photos and Gmail. You’ll also be able to make use of voice commands through the Google Assistant. Unlike other Motorola handsets, it doesn’t have handy Moto Experiences like Gesture controls.Spending less than £100/$100 on a smartphone, you really can’t expect much more than something that just works. It won’t cope with large games, you won’t get a high-quality display and the camera won’t win any awards. So it’s worth managing your expectations when you’re making your decision on which phone to buy.The Motorola Moto E6 Plus will work well for someone who isn't glued to their smartphone, for those who just want to be able to send some text messages, make a few calls here and there, and even occasionally post to social media.What is good about this phone is how small and light it is, it’ll fit into your pocket and you won’t have to worry about damaging it because of the plastic casing. It’ll do everything you need it to, and because it’s Motorola, the Android experience feels seamless to use too. The Motorola Moto E6 Plus is definitely worth considering if you are on a very tight budget.Another phone that costs less than £100 worth considering is the Nokia 3.4, it’s a usable smartphone for not very much money at all. If you're looking to get a new Android handset while spending as little as possible, then we'd suggest getting the Nokia 3.4 somewhere on your list.If you are on the hunt for a cheap phone, but you want a decent camera, you won’t get much better than the Google Pixel 4a. It is a lot pricier than the Moto E6 Plus, but the extra cash will be worth it for improved performance and better photography.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/motorola-moto-e6-plus-review
28,Oppo Find X3 Lite,"Oppo Find X3 Lite review: another solid, affordable Android phone from Oppo","The Oppo Find X3 Lite is, as the 'Lite' branding suggests, the affordable model in the Find X3 range, and it's absolutely a contender for the list of the best cheap phones available right now. In our detailed T3 review, we'll explain everything you need to know about it.As we'll get on to, the phone sits right at the bottom of the lower mid-range section of the market in terms of how much it costs. Go any cheaper than this, and you really are delving into the bargain basement, with all of the shortcuts and trade-offs that are involved.The Oppo Find X3 Lite certainly has other features to tempt you in besides the price – including a large 6.43-inch AMOLED screen and 65W fast charging – and by the time you've finished reading our detailed review, you should know whether or not it's right for you.As the budget option in the Oppo Find X3 range, the low price point of the Lite mode is one of its key selling points: in terms of official retail price, the Lite is £320/AU$450 cheaper than the Oppo Find X3 Neo, and £720/AU$950 cheaper than the Oppo Find X3 Pro. You can save yourself quite a bit of money if you're happy with the compromises that the phone makes.You can pick up the Oppo Find X3 Lite SIM-free for £379 or less from outlets such as Amazon, Very, Argos, John Lewis, Carphone Warehouse and Oppo itself. If you'd rather buy it from a network, you can get it from EE, O2 and Vodafone. It's out and available now in the UK, though it won't be coming to the US.In Australia, you can grab one outright for AU$749 from the likes of JB-HiFi, The Good Guys, MobileCiti and Officeworks, while networks selling it on a plan include Optus and Woolworths Mobile.The Oppo Find X3 Lite may not cost you very much, but the design and finish of this smartphone don't feel cheap at all. Okay, it's not got quite the finely crafted curves and the premium materials of the very best handsets on the market, but it's still well put together in a solid if unspectacular way. There's nothing at all distinctive about the design, but it is perhaps worth noting that there is a 3.5mm headphone jack here, which is now something of a rarity on a smartphone.When it comes to the display, the 6.43-inch AMOLED screen is better than you might expect at this price: it runs at a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels and a maximum refresh rate of 90Hz, making it one of the sharper and more fluid displays you can get on a phone for this amount of money. In use we found it agreeably bright and sharp, though as with the overall design, you can definitely tell the difference between this and the very best phone screens on the market at the moment.The only interruption with the screen is the now familiar punch hole notch for the selfie camera, up in the top left-hand corner. The bezels around the side of the display are thin and even, with the bottom bezel just slightly thicker than the others. Around the back, the rear camera array is tidy and compact, with only a small camera bump to deal with. Overall, it's a design that we like, though you wouldn't really describe it as anything out of the ordinary.There's no waterproofing or dustproofing for the Oppo Find X3 Lite, but then you really wouldn't expect it at a phone selling for this price. Galactic Silver, Azure Blue and Starry Black are your colour options (our review model was Starry Black), though these aren't solid colours – Oppo has finished the Find X3 Lite with a neat gradient effect, which adds an extra touch of style to the overall package.The Oppo Find X3 Lite comes with a competent enough camera, though shots can be slightly oversaturated at times, and images taken in low light aren't anything to write home about. You've got a single-lens 32MP selfie camera here, and a quad-lens 64MP wide + 8MP ultrawide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth rear camera – like several other manufacturers, Oppo stuffs extra lenses in its more affordable handsets that aren't really much use.Pictures and videos certainly come out crisp, bright and well balanced on the whole, with plenty of details captured by that 64MP main sensor (and the ultrawide option is handy to have as well). The results you get from the rear camera are more than good enough to satisfy most people we think – shutter speed is snappy, and large contrasts between light and dark areas of images are handled well.When light is at a premium, the Oppo Find X3 Lite can struggle at times, with noise and blurriness creeping in. The dedicated night mode is among the better ones we've seen – it actually does make a noticeable difference most of the time – but it does mean you have to keep the camera and your subjects steady for a good couple of seconds. The quality is better than you might expect at this price, though not by much.In terms of battery life, two hours of video streaming – with display brightness set to the very maximum and the volume level set relatively low – knocks the 4,300mAh battery level down from 100 percent to 79 percent, so expect around 10 hours of movie watching. More generally, we were impressed at how well the phone holds its charge, and most days you're going to have plenty left in the tank when you get back home in the evening. You don't get any wireless charging, but you do get super-fast 65W wired charging.Under the hood, the Oppo FInd X3 Lite comes running the mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset, and that's paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage space (which you can't expand with a memory card). That puts the phone some way short of the fastest handsets on the market at the moment, but it offers enough in terms of power and performance to keep most users satisfied.We certainly didn't notice much in the way of lag or slowdowns while using the Oppo Find X3 Lite – it'll even run demanding games quite happily, though you might not get the same sort of frame rates as you would on a more expensive flagship. Advances in mobile technology mean mid-range phones are perfectly capable these days, and the Oppo Find X3 Lite is more evidence of that: we managed to get Geekbench 5 scores of 612 (single-core), 1804 (multi-core) and 1272(OpenCL) in our tests.When it comes to the other features on offer, we should mention the 5G support: we've got to the stage where all but the cheapest phones now launch with 5G connectivity, even if networks around the world are only slowly rolling out the technology. It's definitely worth having in terms of future-proofing your phone, but it's not really a major draw any more – with so many phones now offering 5G, it's not a standout feature for the Oppo Find X3 Lite.For accessing and unlocking the smartphone, there's a fingerprint sensor embedded under the display, which is par for the course nowadays – you may or may not prefer it to having one on the back of the handset. Helpfully, Oppo provides a clear plastic case and a screen protector in the Find X3 Lite bundle, though you're not under any obligation to use either of them.Lower mid-range smartphones offer a whole lot of value at the moment: they can be less than half the price of top-end flagships and yet they're fast enough, and well designed enough, and with good enough cameras on board to keep most people happy. The Oppo Find X3 Lite matches that description, but then so do a lot of other phones around this price point, which makes it difficult for any handset to stand out from the crowd.We're not completely enamoured by the ColorOS software that Oppo puts on its phones, and while there's Android 11 underneath, we'd prefer a cleaner, more minimal operating system. There's no wireless charging here, and no waterproofing or dustproofing, and while the display and performance are decent they're not quite top notch – all trade-offs you have to make to spend so little on a phone.On the plus side, you do get a lot back for your money – and that's really all you can ask for from a purchase like this. In all the key categories that matter the Oppo Find X3 Lite stands up well, and if you're shopping around this sort of price level then it's definitely a device that deserves a place on your shortlist.It maybe lacks a real stand out feature, but the 65W fast charging and 5G connectivity are enough to pique our interest, and with a solid design and a nice big, bright screen this is a smartphone that won't let you down at all. Just make sure you check out all the other handsets you can get for slightly less, slightly more, and this exact price.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oppo-find-x3-lite-review
29,Moto G8,Moto G8 review: a decent smartphone on a tight budget,"In this Moto G8 review, I’ll cover everything you need to know about the phone from its price and features to the design, display, camera and performance.For anyone on the hunt for one of the best cheap phones, Motorola is a good starting point. The popular smartphone manufacturer has a huge library of Android phones that won’t cost you the earth yet pack in plenty of features. The Moto G8 is one of them, sitting at the bottom of their G8 series of affordable smartphones, it offers fantastic value paired with decent performance and a large battery. It can’t be considered one of the best Android phones, but for this price, it has plenty to offer.Unveiled back in March 2020, the Moto G8 is available now from a number of retailers for competitive prices. Take a look at the widgets on this page for more up to date information. At the time of writing, you could pick one up for £184 in the UK and AU$283.77 in Australia. Unfortunately, the Moto G8 isn’t available in the US.The Moto G series is a long-standing line of budget smartphones that aim to give you the most for your money. The Moto G8 improved on the G7 with an upgraded processor, a bigger screen and battery, as well as a more sophisticated camera system. It comes with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, 64GB of storage and a MicroSD card slot to expand it further. The next generation of the handset, the Moto G9, was launched in late 2020.The Moto G8 is a big phone with a big screen. Measuring 161.27 x 75.8 x 8.95mm and weighing 183g, it feels thick to hold. Despite having a plastic casing, it's a sturdy handset that will withstand knocks and bumps. It also comes with a clear protective case included in the box. Those with small hands may find it a bit of a stretch to use though. With a screen-to-body ratio of 88%, the bezels look more prominent than on pricier handsets which gives the phone away as being a more budget option.On the back, alongside the three camera lenses is a fingerprint sensor to unlock it. It was placed slightly too high up but other than that it was far more reliable than the in-display sensors used by other phones in this price range. On the frame, there’s the power button and volume controls, as well as a USB-C charging port on the bottom and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top. The screen itself is only interrupted by the hole-punch style camera in the top left corner.The 6.4inch Max Vision display has an aspect ratio of 19:9 so gives you immersive ultrawide viewing at HD+ (1560x720) resolution. The IPS panel does look like that of a cheap phone, it won’t be noticeable for everyday tasks like messaging or light web browsing, but it becomes quite obvious watching TV and movies especially because you won’t be able to stream shows in Full HD. I’m not saying it’s a bad screen, but you do get what you pay for when it comes to the display quality.A three-lens camera system sits on the back of the handset. That includes a 16MP main lens, a 2MP macro lens and an 8MP ultrawide lens. On the front, is an 8MP selfie camera.Considering the fact that this phone costs less than £200, I was more than impressed with its point-and-shoot photography in natural daylight. It doesn’t have anywhere near the level of detail that you’d get on a flagship or even mid-range phone, but shots came out looking bright and quite sharp, although colours were sometimes off-balance. Despite that, in the right lighting with the right focus point, they will be good enough to use on social media.The 2MP macro lens, on the other hand, produced grainy shots that won’t be of much use. Similarly, the photos by the 8x digital zoom were blurry and won’t give you usable shots either. There’s also no dedicated night mode so the flash will have to do, although it does do a good job at lighting the scene and picking up detail at night.Powered using the mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 chip and 4GB of RAM, you’ll get a pretty solid performance from the Moto G8.In Geekbench 5, it scored 310 in single-core and 1,306 in multi-core, similar to the slightly pricier Vivo Y70. It won’t blow you away with ultrafast speeds, particularly if you compare it to some of the best phones you can buy. But having said that, it does a decent job at coping with most day-to-day tasks and can even handle a bit of light mobile gaming. The Moto G8 does only have 64GB of in-built storage though, so you won’t want to fill it up with large games anyway.As you may have guessed at this price, you won’t get super-fast internet either because the Moto G8 isn’t 5G capable and doesn’t use the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology, opting for Wi-Fi 5 instead. There’s also no NFC so you won’t be able to use the handset to make contactless payments through Google Pay.The 4,000mAh battery is the area where you’ll get the most bang for your buck, it’ll easily last you the whole day out and about. I played a video on full brightness over two hours and the battery level dropped by about 20% which suggests I would have had 10 hours of playback overall. That’s not bad at all for a cheap phone. In the box, you get a 10W rapid charger, it took about two hours to fully recharge which is okay. There’s no wireless charging here.Running on Android 10, the Moto G8 has a light Motorola skin which adds a few useful functionalities through Moto Experiences. That gives you voice control through the Google Assistant, and Moto Gestures like the three-finger screenshot, pick up to silence and swipe to shrink the screen. It also comes loaded with essential apps like Gmail and Google Photos. Although not quite as satisfying as Samsung’s pure Android experience, this operating system is, without doubt, one of the better versions of Android. It feels sharp, clean and intuitive.If you are spending less than £200 on a phone, you can’t expect lightning-fast performance, flawless photography or a dazzling display - but considering its price tag, the Moto G8 is a solid smartphone that will get the job done when it comes to everyday tasks like phone calls, messaging and social media. The best part about it is that it will last you through the whole day without needing a charge, and having a decent camera is an added bonus. As far as cheap phones go, this one is definitely worth considering.If you are considering the Moto G8, other cheap phones you might want to look at are the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite and the Google Pixel 4a.The Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite has plenty going for it, including 5G support and good performance. However, if you are desperate for a decent camera and you're willing to spend just a little more, then the Google Pixel 4a is a top choice. It’s capable of taking fantastic shots, it has decent specs and it runs on pure Android. It’s easily one of the best cheap phones you can buy.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/moto-g8-review
30,Asus Zenfone 8,Asus Zenfone 8 review: compact and powerful,"Dimensions: 148x 68.5x 8.9mm
Weight: 169 g
Screen: 5.9 inches AMOLED (120Hz, HDR10+)
CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888
GPU: Adreno 660
RAM: 16GB
Storage: 256GB
Rear cameras: 64MP, 12MP
Front cameras: 12MP
Battery: 4,000 mAh
OS: ZenUI 8 Android 11
5G: YesIn short, what you should take away from this Asus Zenfone 8 review is that great things can come in small packages.Over the years, phones have been getting bigger and bigger, packing in more and more impressive tech. T3's guide to the best Android phones is packed full of devices with 6.5inch screens and above. For some, a large phone with a large screen is perfect. For others, it’s uncomfortable and unnecessary, especially if you have smaller hands.As things stand there isn’t much out there for those who want top-tier specs in a smaller handset. Asus aim to fill the gap with the Zenfone 8 creating what they’ve labelled as “the ultimate compact Android phone”.At first glance, this small phone with its 5.9inch display doesn’t look like anything special but delve a bit deeper and you’ll find out that it's actually a lot more interesting than it first appears. Asus has managed to fit in a top of the line 5G processor, plenty of RAM and high-end screen tech. So how does it match up to those ginormous flagship smartphones? Read on to find out.Launched on the 12th May 2021, the Asus Zenfone 8 will be available soon directly from the Asus website with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for £599 (roughly AU$900). Or with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage for £699 (roughly AU$1,200). In this review, I checked out the 16GB / 256GB version. US pricing should be around $599 for the base model and $799 for the top-spec version.What sets this phone apart from the crowd? The Asus Zenfone 8 has a comfortable 5.9inch FHD 120Hz display and a compact design. Other features include the top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, a 4,000mAh battery, a 64MP main camera and a durable build.Available in Obsidian Black and Horizon Silver, from the outside the Asus Zenfone 8 keeps things simple and doesn’t have much of a wow-factor in design features or colours. It measures 148 x 68.5 x 8.9mm and weighs only 169g - for comparison that’s over 20g lighter than the OnePlus 9 and the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.The 5.9inch display is surrounded by slim bezels, its screen-to-body ratio is 90.2% so they’re not as thin as you get on other phones. It’s only interrupted by a hole-punch camera in the top left of the screen, it's framed with a silver ring which looks a little out of place. The small screen made the phone comfortable to use with one hand, despite the phone itself feeling quite thick. On the back, it has a small two-lens camera module, while on the frame you'll find a USB-C charging port and 3.5mm headphone jack. There’s no SD card slot to expand the storage on the Asus Zenfone 8. In the box, you get a 30W charger, USB-C cable and a protective case for the phone.Using the Samsung E4 AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080p (FHD+) and 1,100nits peak brightness, it easily matches up to high-end flagship phones in almost every area except size. It doesn’t feel as crisp as the most expensive handsets but the 120Hz refresh rate gives it just as smooth a scrolling, swiping and gaming experience. The HDR10+ support means you can make the most of TV streaming sites like Netflix, it provides more detailed colours and a better contrast to enhance the video quality overall. The Asus Zenfone 8’s display also has always-on capabilities. Impressive!To unlock the phone, the Asus Zenfone 8 features an in-display fingerprint reader. Sometimes these can be temperamental, this one was reliable and registered my fingerprint quickly every time.The Asus Zenfone 8 only has two camera lenses on the back- a 64MP wide camera and a 12MP ultrawide camera. It comes as a surprise considering the recent trend for at least three rear lenses, which also means there's no dedicated telephoto lens. On the front is a 12MP selfie camera.Point-and-shoot photos were of decent quality yet they did come out looking a little on the bland side in comparison to high-end flagships. The colours lacked vibrancy and definition, while it didn’t do a great job at brightening up darker areas of the shot either. In saying that the camera still managed to pick up tonnes of intricate detail in the image, something that is most apparent in shots up close to the subject. Take a look at the gallery below to see some of the shots I took on the Asus Zenfone 8.Video can be recorded in resolutions up to 8K at 24fps. There are also a few different video modes to try out like Time Lapse and Slow-Mo. Just like with still images, videos on the default FHD settings came out looking a little on the dark side. They didn’t suffer from too much shakiness or grain though.Packing the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and the Adreno 660 GPU with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage, the Asus Zenfone 8 is just as powerful as any recent flagship. A massive achievement considering its tiny size.It happily coped with photo edits and mobile games, as proved by its Geekbench 5 scores where it matched up to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra with a single-core score of 1,124 and a multi-core score of 3,752. Those are some of the best scores we’ve seen, especially on a phone of size and stature.Supporting 5G, you’ll be guaranteed the fastest speeds on your network if you live in an area that supports it. Similarly, if you have the right kit, the Asus Zenfone 8 has Wifi 6 so you’ll be able to make the absolute most out of your home broadband as well.The 4,000mAh battery is smaller than on pricier flagships. Over two hours of video on full brightness, the phone’s battery dropped by 16% suggesting that it would have lasted 12.5 hours all in all, which isn't bad, but it's not amazing either. There are five battery modes to choose from, so you’ll only be using up what you need to, if you remember to switch between them that is. They include a high-performance mode, the standard dynamic mode, a durable mode that regulates performance and connectivity to preserve battery, an ultra-durable mode that sets performance level for essential system operations only and the advanced mode giving you personalised battery settings.When it does run out of battery, the phone will only take just over an hour to recharge. Even if you only charge it for half an hour, you'll get enough juice to last most of the day. What’s more, is the scheduled charging feature which prevents wear on the battery by keeping it at a lower percentage while plugged in overnight so it doesn't trickle charge at 100%. That should mean your battery stays consistent for longer. One downside of the Asus Zenfone 8 is that there's no wireless charging.Running on ZenUI 8, the operating system feels close to pure Android, just perhaps a slightly less sophisticated version of it. It’s intuitive, well-organised and easy to use. The phone comes with the essential Google apps installed and the basic smartphone apps you’d expect like a calculator and contact address book. Asus doesn’t bore you with unnecessary apps in its user interface. When you swipe down from the top, you’ll also find a one-handed mode, not that you really need it with the screen being this small.Asus aren’t necessarily the manufacturer you’d look towards in your hunt for the best smartphone, which is perhaps why they’ve made such an effort to fill a significant gap in the market.A compact phone with plenty of power, the Asus Zenfone 8 may not be the best-looking smartphone there is, but it is one of the fastest. You can’t expect to take award-winning photos using the basic camera system and you don’t get days and days of battery from it either. What you do get is an upper-mid-range phone with high-end performance that will easily fit into your pocket. It's all about simplicity, speed and proving that bigger doesn't always mean better!If it’s a compact phone you’re after, then you still can’t beat the Google Pixel 4a - it’s got a 5.81inch display and costs less than $350 / £350. You won’t get a super-powerful phone fit for any type of task, however, you will get a fantastic all-rounder with a decent camera. It is arguably the most popular small phone you can buy.Another phone worth considering is the Sony Xperia 5 II which is an impressive phone in pretty much every area, and it is similar in price to the Asus Zenfone 8. This handset really excels at photography and in the quality of its 6.1inch screen which is perfect for streaming video.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/asus-zenfone-8-review

5G: YesTo sum up this Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra review in a few words: this phone is big, fast and just a little bit different.All of the best smartphones you can buy right now are actually very similar, it’s a recipe for success so why mess with that? Well, the smartphone market is becoming pretty oversaturated and it’s becoming harder and harder to stand out against the crowd. So no wonder Xiaomi has pushed the boat out a bit with the Mi 11 Ultra.At first glance, it looks like any other flagship handset. Turn it around and you’ll find something that no other phone has. The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra has a second tiny screen on the camera module. Meant as an always-on display, notification window and for previewing your selfies, it is a little gimmicky but during testing, I actually used it much more than I expected.Two screens isn’t all this luxury phone has to show for itself, it’s also one of the fastest handsets on the market and one of the best Android phones you can buy. In this Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra review, I’ll take you through everything you need to know including what’s new as well as a rundown on its design, display, camera and performance.Launched in the UK in May 2021, the Mi 11 Ultra is available now direct from Xiaomi in Ceramic Black for £1,199. In Australia, you’ll be looking at AU$1,799. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to get your hands on one in the US as Xiaomi doesn’t sell its phones there.Going up against the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra with its eye-watering price, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra means business.The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is a complete overhaul of the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro, Xiaomi’s premium phone from 2020. Not only is it now a much more powerful device thanks to an improved processor and more RAM, but Xiaomi has also boosted the screen resolution and size, renewed the camera system as well as packed in a bigger battery. Oh, and not to mention the second screen they’ve included on the back of the phone. They’re such different phones that you can’t even really compare them. Coming more in line with other flagships this year like the OnePlus 9 or the Samsung Galaxy S21, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra also has wireless charging, a 120Hz refresh rate and 8K video.Earlier in 2021, Xiaomi released the Xiaomi Mi 11 which sports the same processor, battery and operating system. It also has a similar display, as well as wireless charging - the biggest differences are the camera system and the lack of a second screen. If you like the idea of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra but can’t stomach the price, it’s a much more accessible option.Taking the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra out of the box, the first thing you’ll notice is how big the handset is. It measures 164.3 x 74.6 x 8.38mm and weighs 234g, so in comparison to its competitors, it is one of the heaviest devices around. For me personally, the phone soon became uncomfortable to use one-handed, so that’s worth bearing in mind if you have small hands too.On the front, it has a large curved display while on the back is a three-lens camera module that stretches across the entire width of the phone, with a small screen on the right-hand side.  It comes in two classy colourways: Ceramic Black and Ceramic White. You’ll find the standard USB-C charging port on the bottom, and on the edge of the frame, there's the usual power button as well as volume controls. Xiaomi hasn’t included a 3.5mm headphone jack. If that’s a problem for you, the phone comes with a USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adaptor.The camera notch is undeniably huge and will most certainly get in the way sliding the handset in and out of your pocket. One of the most common issues with a large camera module is usually that it makes the phone unstable to use on a table or other flat surfaces. That’s actually not a problem here because it stretches across the whole width of the phone keeping it secure although it did mean the phone lies tilted.You can use the tiny 1.1inch display to check the time, see your notifications or battery level and preview selfies. If you are playing music, you can use it to pause or play the music and skip through tracks without turning the phone over. Although, it wasn't always that responsive and sometimes took a few taps to recognise my touch so it would probably be easier to just pick the phone up. I did actually find myself using it way more than expected. Partly because the phone was always lying on its front so it was the easiest way to check the time. I must admit when the rear display isn’t switched on, it is a bit of an eye-sore.Boasting a WQHD+ (3200x1440) 6.81inch AMOLED display with 1.07 billion colours, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra does not skimp on its screen. All of that alongside a whopping 1,700nits peak brightness makes for a seriously eye-popping display. Super sharp lettering and vibrant colours give this phone a stunning edge while HDR10+ support means you’ll be able to make the most out of your favourite Netflix shows too. Despite its impressive specifications, I wouldn’t say it’s better than other recent flagship phones from 2021, like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra for instance. To unlock the phone there’s an in-display fingerprint sensor that works quickly, reliably and will also be able to link up to some health apps as a heart rate monitor.Following the trend set by other smartphone manufacturers, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra has a 120Hz refresh rate with AdaptiveSync to automatically adjust it according to the type of on-screen activity, helping to conserve battery life. No matter what it is you’re doing, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra delivers effortless scrolling and swiping whether it’s in mobile games or simply browsing the web.Included in the box is a clear protective case, it’ll help protect the body of the phone but I can’t see it doing much to shield the camera module. Unlike both its predecessor (the Mi 10 Pro) and its little sibling (the Mi 11) the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra has IP68 water resistance which is sure to give you extra peace of mind using it on a rainy day or by a pool.The camera tech is equally as impressive as the rest of the handset. There are three rear lenses- a 50mp wide-angle lens, a 48MP ultra-wide-angle lens and a 48MP telephoto camera. On the front is a 20MP selfie camera.For simple point-and-shoot photography, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra did a cracking job. Shots of cityscapes and landscapes were well-balanced with vibrant colours, and they had tons of intricate detail even when you zoom right into the shot. I took a few snaps of plants, bikes and buildings on a gloomy day and the camera did a great job at brightening darker areas of the scene without overcompensating.The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra has 120x digital zoom, 10x hybrid zoom and 5x optical zoom. Up to 10x zoom, you’ll easily get shots precise enough to use on social media. The 120x zoom won’t give you that but it will give you far more than the naked eye can. Take a look at its abilities in the gallery below.When it came to portraits, shots came out looking sharp and bright. I did find that they weren’t the most flattering because they were so detailed and slightly oversaturated yet this was easily rectifiable by tweaking the settings slightly. Selfies from the front camera were okay, they looked a little bland and even slightly grainy at times though.With tons of camera modes to play around with, the Mi 11 Ultra is well equipped for all sorts of scenes, be it at night, photographing documents or even snaps of the moon. The Macro mode took incredibly detailed shots up close, even though it put a weird fish-eye effect on the frame.What’s really interesting about the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is the tiny screen on the back camera module which allows you to preview shots. Ultimately this means you no longer need to lose out on image quality using the front camera, you can make the most of everything the main lenses have to offer even when it comes to taking selfies. Anyone who posts a lot on social media is sure to go mad over this feature.Using the rear display to take selfies worked a treat. You aren’t going to see everything in the shot yet it does give you a good idea of whether you’ve managed to fit everyone in. If you are trying to capture smaller details in the background, holding it at arm’s length or putting it on a timer and moving even further away does mean you’re likely to miss parts. I can’t see that being an issue very often though.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 1,132Multi-Core Score: 3,722[Compute]OpenCL: 4,592Vulkan: 4,053Under the hood is the flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip, 12GB RAM and 256GB storage. Paired with that is the Qualcomm Adreno 660 GPU. After having used it for everything from a bit of social media scrolling to more intense activities like mobile gaming and photo-editing, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra feels seriously fast and completely capable. It got a little warm at times yet still managed to keep up with just about anything.Its speed was backed up by Geekbench 5 where it scored 1,132 in single-core and 3,722 in multi-core. That’s even higher than the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (1,109 / 3,674) and the OnePlus 9 Pro (1,087 / 3,510). I then ran 3DMark’s Wild Life test on it, to benchmark its gaming abilities. It scored an average frame rate of 34.10 (that’s the same as both of the above flagships). The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra actually maxed out 3DMark’s Sling Shot and Sling Shot Extreme tests. So this phone is a notch above the rest when it comes to performance, making it an absolute joy to use for any task you can throw at it. If you are seriously into mobile games then rest assured this will make a fantastic gaming handset.Naturally, the Mi 11 Ultra has 5G so you’ll be able to make the most of next-gen mobile data speeds as well if you live in an area that supports it. Similarly, Wifi 6 means if you have the kit for it, you’ll get the fastest internet possible.There’s no point in having a fast phone if its battery isn’t up to scratch. The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra has a large 5,000mAh battery which is certainly promising. I put it through its paces and found it easily lasted me the whole day.Wild Life: 5,687 (Average frame rate = 34.10fps)Sling Shot: Maxed Out!Sling Shot Extreme (OpenGL ES 3.1): Maxed Out!To test it out more accurately, I downloaded a video and ran it for two hours on full brightness. In that time, the battery dropped by 14% suggesting it would have lasted almost 14 and a half hours. Despite not being the most impressive battery in a flagship smartphone, that’s not at all bad. To recharge it again, there’s a 67W wired turbo charger included in the box, or if you have the kit for it, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra also supports 67W wireless charging.Running MIUI 12 OS, it’s based on Android 11 so feels familiar and intuitive. Starting the phone up for the first time, it comes with an app or two that most will be quick to uninstall like Agoda. Others might actually be handy to have pre-installed (depending on who you are) such as all of the core Google apps, TikTok, Facebook and Amazon.Built-in dual speakers are tuned by Harmon and Kardon and make for a loud warm sound. You’ll be able to get away with watching TV shows and movies using them, however music did sound a little distorted with the volume turned all the way up so you’ll still want to hook up a separate speaker or pair of headphones before opening up Spotify.You can’t call the Xiaomi Mi 11 the perfect phone - it’s heavy, bulky and not to mention the eye-sore that is the camera module on the back. I also think it's a shame that the second display isn't more responsive and doesn't have more uses. Having said that, this handset surprised me with lightning speed performance, long battery life, an impressive display and detailed point-and-shoot photography.Because of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s price, not everyone will be convinced by it. After all, this is a luxury phone through and through. But for those who want something a little different and can see themselves making use of selfie previews on the second display then there’s nothing else like it. It doesn’t even have to be about the second screen though - if you need a powerful phone to make photo edits on the go, or you are massively into mobile gaming, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra will be a good fit for you.If you don’t have a strict budget and want one of the best Android phones for performance, then you won’t get much better than the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or the OnePlus 9 Pro. But if those phones are a little too pricey for you, then you should consider the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G or the OnePlus 9, both of which can offer you superb performance with detailed camera systems at lower prices.For the best phone overall, the iPhone 12  combines beauty with speed and a camera that professionals will happily vouch for. If you are reading this Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra review then it’s likely you’re a self-professed ‘Android person’ still it’s worth considering this iOS heavyweight.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-review

5G: YesFor this Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 review, it’s first worth pointing out that until now foldable phones have been more of a gimmick than anything really worth considering, the second iteration of Samsung’s Z Fold without a doubt changes that. Is this handset the game-changing phone we’ve been waiting for?While other smartphone manufacturers are yet to launch their own foldable phones, Samsung is ahead of the game with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 being their second attempt at a phone that transforms itself into a tablet. So what does the competition look like? So far, there aren’t many other options out there, the Huawei Mate Xs or the Xiaomi Mi Mix Fold are two rivals that feature in T3’s guide to the best folding phones, alongside other clamshell-style handsets that fold out into regular-sized smartphones.Sitting at around twice the cost of their recent flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S21, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is very pricey, there’s still a long way to go when it comes to making foldable phones accessible. For those who would make the most of it, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is THE foldable phone, but is it really worth spending that much money on? Read on to find out.The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is available now, directly from Samsung it will set you back $1,599.99 in the US, £1,599 in the UK and AU$2,114 in Australia. Take a look at the widgets for other retailers and up to date pricing.In the hopes of making the second generation of Samsung’s foldable phone a more convincing device, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 has made a few major improvements to what came before it.Firstly, Samsung has refreshed the design, it’s gotten slimmer with bigger screens. On the cover, the folded screen is now 6.2inches up from 4.6inches. While what used to be a 7.3inch phablet display, is now 7.6inches - a welcome change giving you more display real estate to work with. Other big changes include a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, a new camera system including two 10MP front cameras, an updated processor and an improved hinge. One step down on its predecessor is that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 has halved the storage from 512GB to 256GB, yet there’s still no MicroSD slot.The overall design of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 feels like a classic Samsung smartphone, just chunkier. Measuring 159.2 x 68.0 x 13.8mm when folded and weighing 282g, it will definitely add quite a lot of bulk to your pocket. The long, thin 6.2inch screen on the front is much bigger than the original but still took a bit of getting used to. Opening it like a book reveals a 7.6inch mini tablet on the inside. That gives plenty of screen space to use comfortably to open up documents, play games or watch videos.Samsung has fixed the fragility issues with the hinge that was a massive problem in the first generation, making it now feel sturdy and relatively smooth. The new hinge allows the main display to be used in a number of different positions. You don’t necessarily need to have it completely flat and it can be used in the style of a miniature laptop.Two colour options are available, a Mystic Bronze or Mystic Black. If you buy directly through Samsung, you can also choose to customise the hinge with metallic silver, blue, red or gold. I saw the mystic bronze colourway, realistically it looks more pink than bronze though. A three-lens camera module sits on the back of the phone, it does stick out quite a lot making it quite unstable to use on a flat surface, whether it’s folded or not. There are also two hole-punch selfie cameras, one on the cover and one on the larger display inside.The main 7.6inch screen is Dynamic AMOLED with a resolution of 2208 x 1768 pixels. Being adaptive, the 120Hz refresh rate automatically gets dialled up or down depending on how demanding the task at hand is, this also helps to conserve battery life. Everything from scrolling and swiping to gaming and typing felt silky and seamless. As well as that, it delivers on overall quality with sharp, crisp details and bright colours. A visible dent where the hinge sits does interrupt the display and I did find it could be annoying when the light catches it in a game or when streaming video. Despite that, I expected the hinge to be much more of a problem than it was. The screen was responsive all over, and although you may not want to use this as a replacement for a larger tablet or laptop, it will be great for getting a bit of work done on the go.On the front cover is a 6.2inch Super AMOLED with a resolution of 816 x 1536 pixels and a 60Hz refresh rate, which is noticeably different in quality from the main screen. I used it more often than I expected, yet still nowhere near as much as the inside display. It was handy for quick tasks like responding to a message or checking the time, the drop in resolution and refresh rate didn’t really matter so much in that sense.  The long and thin design felt more cramped to use than a regular smartphone, as mentioned previously it’s still a massive improvement on the original 4.6inch display on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold.To unlock the handset, there’s a fingerprint sensor that doubles up as the power button on the right, underneath the volume controls. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work the first time, often taking a few attempts and different thumb positioning. To charge the phone, there’s a USB-C on the bottom of the frame on the rear panel. There’s no 3.5mm headphone jack included nor is there a MicroSD card slot.The camera system on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is comprised of three 12MP cameras and two 10MP front-facing cameras - so you can snap a selfie or video call a friend with the phone folded or unfolded.First, let’s talk about the rear cameras. Boosting colours in the scene is what this phone camera does best, no matter the lighting conditions, shots did come out looking bright and vibrant. Up close to subjects, it managed to pick up finer details while the night mode did a good enough job at lightening the scene. There were a few downsides though, this was by no means the best camera you can get on a smartphone. It sometimes struggled with contrast between light and dark areas, shots also lacked some detail at times, especially in the ultrawide mode. It has 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom, which meant if you only needed to zoom in slightly shots came out looking good but at 10x zoom, they looked grainy.The front cameras actually do a very decent job, producing sharp, flattering selfies especially with the beauty mode set to your own preferences. One problem I found wasn’t in the shots produced by the cameras, it was actually taking them in the first place. Because of how heavy the phone is, it was hard to hold it up in the right position to take a selfie, whether it’s folded or not.Samsung’s folding phones give you a few extra camera features that you wouldn’t get elsewhere. Using the camera app on the main screen, with the phone half folded, you can see your previous shots on the bottom half, and the camera preview on the top half. You can compare and improve your shots, giving you a much better chance of capturing the best snaps possible. There’s also Dual Preview which shows the camera’s view on both screens simultaneously, so both the subject and photographer can see the image preview at once. Perfect for making sure your pose is just right.Using the top-of-the-line Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus chipset, along with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 was undeniably fast across a variety of different apps and games, and no matter how many were running in the background at once.I didn’t notice any problems with lag or stuttering, as proved by its Geekbench 5 scores which were 966 in single-core and 3,239 in multi-core, similar scores to the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G, so its safe to say that it impressed me in that realm. Flagships like the OnePlus 9 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra did score marginally higher in those tests. However, at that high of a level, you won’t really notice the difference. Supporting 5G, you’ll be able to make use of the fastest possible internet if you live in an area that supports it as well. Surprisingly, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 doesn’t use the newest Wifi 6 tech.Samsung claims the 4,500mAh battery will last up to 18 hours of video playback. I put this to the test by running a video stored on the phone for two hours on full brightness, the battery dropped by 18% suggesting it would last around 11 hours in total. That's a pretty average score and definitely below par at this price. When it came to charging it back up again, over the space of an hour it reached 67% so would take about an hour and a half to fully recharge from empty, not the best you can get yet still quite respectable.Running on Android 11 with Samsung’s OneUI 3.1, it looks as neat and clean as what we have come to expect from Samsung. Unique to their folding phones is the Flex Mode that reorganises the screen layouts to help you get the most out of the main display, often putting the main app content on the top half and the settings or keyboard on the bottom. Although largely restricted to Samsung apps like the camera and Video Call, Google Duo and YouTube are also supported.So if you’re considering splashing out on a folding phone that transforms into a tablet, as things stand, you literally cannot get better than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. I’m not saying there isn’t room for improvement, because there most definitely is. In fact, there are a few areas that could do much better, the two main ones being its battery life and camera system, both of which aren’t as good as you would expect from a smartphone of this price.However, in comparing this phone to what came before it, Samsung has made some giant leaps making this a handset actually worth having. With bigger, more impressive screens, a sturdier hinge and an improved processor, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 could plausibly be used for more than just a little web browsing. It’s not going to replace laptops and larger tablets anytime soon but for those who need a device for working or gaming on the go, it’ll be a fantastic choice. Can’t wait to see what’s next Samsung!If it’s a powerhouse Android smartphone you’re after, consider the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra which has a high-performing chipset, 5G and S Pen support. It may not have a tablet-sized display however it’s still pretty big at 6.9inches. Take a look at the best Samsung phones, for other similar devices that will deliver on power, battery life and camera system.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review
33,BT Premium Cordless Phone,BT Premium Cordless Phone review: the best of BT's landline phones,"There’s still plenty of demand for the best landline phones, as witnessed by two of BT’s models; the BT4600 Big Button and this one. The all singing, all dancing BT Premium Cordless Phone.While the best smartphones have taken over the world, plenty of us still have a landline connection and it’s often part of the package if you’re signed up to a telecoms company such as BT or Virgin Media. It therefore makes sense to have a decent phone connected to your landline, if only so you can block those endless nuisance calls we all seem to get.For relatively small money a decent landline phone can actually turn out to be mighty handy, as we’ve just discovered after binning our ancient existing handset and replacing it with a shiny new offering. Here’s what you can expect from the BT Premium Phone we've been trying.The BT Premium Phone is a UK-centric landline phone, which is mated to a base station that plugs into the mains and provides a host of features and functions for handling incoming and outgoing calls to your home. It comes with an RRP of £69.99, while it’s possible to augment the single unit with a twin or trio pack for use in other rooms via additional phone ports.Unsurprisingly, BT makes a big deal about the phone being able to deal with unwanted callers and the box proclaims ‘Block 100% nuisance calls’ in order to underline its headline feature. However, this is a landline phone that packs in some really great additional features, especially if you want to use it in unison with your other mobile handsets.The BT Premium Cordless Phone is not available in the USA or Australia, we are sorry to tell you.This comes billed as a Premium Phone for good reason as the set of features is certainly impressive. If you, like everyone else, spend more time focusing on your smartphone then the good news is that BT’s Premium Phone has been designed with crossover appeal. It features Bluetooth, which means it's possible to import, or sync, all of the contacts on your mobile into the landline handset, up to 3,000 numbers in fact.Of course, the best thing about this phone though is its muscular blocking button, which sits just underneath the display and lets you prevent unwanted calls. This can take on up to 1,000 nuisance numbers before the phone most likely implodes or you give up and get rid of your landline altogether. That’s just part of the process though because the phone utilises the well-respected trueCall, which is a blocking system that effectively vets your calls before you answer them.Another appealing aspect of this phone is its relatively straightforward setup process. Considering the list of functions it contains, the getting started part of the process is made easier thanks to a neat built-in wizard. This is useful for getting the call blocking aspect in place as well as establishing other key areas of the phone’s operation.In terms of additional features then there’s not much this handset/docking station combo can't handle, with number blacklisting and a Do Not Disturb setting all adding value. The answerphone is impressive too, holding up to 60 minutes of recordings, any of which can be listened to remotely if you’re away from home. There’s really something here for any type of user.If you’re going to be upgrading an existing landline from a traditional old-school style handset that just lets you answer an incoming call and that’s about it then the BT Premium Phone is a revelation. We’ve ignored the old phone in our house, actually purloined from an office, simply because it hardly ever gets used. As nuisance calls have grown however, having a quality landline has become an essential bit of kit.This is where owning something like the BT Premium Phone definitely works in your favour. Its bulging set of features primed us for a nightmarish setup, but the wizard gets you through most of the basics and some of the more advanced aspects too. There’s a chunky manual included by the way. With some numbers on board we gave the unit a whirl after first charging it for the recommended 16 (!) hours.Making outgoing calls is a cinch, with nothing untoward to report. The phone’s clarity is excellent, either through the earpiece or on speakerphone. The coverage seems great too, allowing you to walk around downstairs unhindered by cables. There’s a handsfree speaker, while the volume control offers plenty of adjustment depending on your hearing capability.The 1.8-inch colour screen is adequate and while it's not exactly high resolution it tells you everything you need to know. This includes showing the number of an incoming call. Recognise it and you can pick up, if not then disregard it. Better still, block it!The call blocking feature seems particularly impressive. The on-board virtual assistant vets calls and we found it great at deterring unwanted cold calls, spammers and, possibly, scammers too. Known callers can get straight through, which means if you’ve got family and friends listed in the phone then the access is instant.Overall, we couldn't find anything of any note about the BT Premium Phone that proved to be a disappointment. It certainly makes life easier, and even a little less stressful if you’re plagued by a relentless barrage of nuisance calls. All in all we think the BT Premium Phone is a great little investment. Spend a bit of time initially getting it set up and you’ll end up with a box of tricks that takes all of the hassle out of having a landline.Better still, if you spend more time on your mobile and the landline is a secondary method of being contacted then the Bluetooth functionality bridges the two perfectly. With more of us working from home these days you might get more use out of it than you think.Being a DECT-standard model, the phone also seems to work with non-BT landline providers too, as we tried ours through a Virgin Media account and it still functioned as expected. However, some services might not work (though we haven't found any as yet) and if you are on a contract with BT bear in mind that a few of their add-on options incur additional charges too. Best check that with BT before purchasing. The phone itself though is top-notch.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/bt-premium-cordless-phone-review
34,BT4600 Big Button Phone,BT4600 Big Button Phone review: a very easy to use landline phone with beefy call blocking,"The BT4600 Big Button Phone review in brief: it does what it says on the tin.Having a home, DECT or 'landline' phone is still commonplace for many people in the UK despite the popularity of smartphones. Chances are, you might have a landline as part of your broadband package and, while you might not use your home phone much, it is worth having a decent handset plugged in and ready to receive or make calls. Even more so if it packs an answering machine.The best landline phones aren’t always about high-tech frills. While the BT4600 Big Button Phone we’re looking at here might not seem state-of-the-art it’s a great package that’s ideally suited to users who might struggle with flashier models. It’s perfect if you have hearing or sight issues, thanks to the bigger buttons and bright display, but there’s plenty of other functionality that makes it suited to all kinds of user.The BT 4600 Big Button Phone is the best selling handset in the BT landline phone portfolio. The RRP for a single handset pack is £44.99, but there are twin handset, trio handset and quad handset packs available.It’s a UK-focused handset and cradle combination that offers a powerful set of call assist features, an answer machine and beefy call blocking functionality. The BT 4600 Big Button Phone has been designed to help users that might struggle with conventional designs, most notably because of its oversized controls.Please note this phone is not on sale in the USA or Australia.This might be a relatively budget landline option, but the BT 4600 Big Button Phone still manages to pack in some decent features. In fact, there’s more than enough for most users who want an all-in-one device that includes an answer machine. Inside the box there’s the handset, which is nice and chunky so it’s easy to hold and features those big buttons.BT’s user-friendly option is also hearing aid compatible, while it's also quick and easy to adjust the volume if a caller isn’t loud enough. The display isn’t exactly amazing but the black text against the orange background does make it easily readable. There’s a supporting dock, where you place the phone when it’s not in use and this also contains core controls for the answer machine.The answer machine can record up to 60 minutes of messages. It’s also possible to store 200 contacts in the phone too. Usefully, there’s a redial option for the last 30 numbers you’ve used, which makes it a doddle to call someone back. The big deal with this phone though, aside from those buttons, is the call blocking. BT reckons its 100% effective and we found no reason to disagree. The system makes use of trueCall, a call blocking service that is great at getting the job done and lets you block up to 1000 numbers.This is a DECT phone too, which is basically an industry standard design that means it should work with other phone providers. That’s not a definite though, so be sure to check with your provider or pick through their FAQs before you purchase one. We tried our example with Virgin Media though and it seemed to work just fine.Perhaps the best thing about the BT4600 Big Button Phone is its ease of use. It performs perfectly, especially if you’re in need of help getting to grips with its functionality. This aspect is boosted by the manual, which features plenty of clear instructions and graphics that illustrate how to get the phone up and running. It includes how to get contacts into the phone and also explores everything related to call blocking.Using the trueCall system this phone proves to be brilliant at blocking those unwanted calls we all get. It’s worth taking the time to pick through the manual and get the phone setup correctly, but once you’ve digested how it works there’s a big ‘Block’ button just underneath the screen that allows you to send unwanted calls packing. If you’ve got recognised numbers listed in the phone then family and friends get to bypass the vetting process, making it even more user-friendly. Just being able to see the number calling on the screen is handy.We were also impressed at the connectivity of the phone if you start walking away from the base. In fact, thanks to its batteries (which are rechargeable by the way), you can wander freely while on a lengthy call without any problems. The volume is quick and easy to adjust too, which will be a real bonus for anyone with hearing issues especially thanks to its built-in induction loop.It’s vital to keep the mains-powered base plugged in though. If you inadvertently unplug it then you’ll find that the handset loses battery power quite quickly, overnight in our case, and the phone starts making an intermittent beeping noise. Presumably to let you know it’s not working properly. Otherwise though, performance is largely excellent.This is a no-nonsense handset and dock combination that is unsurprisingly BT’s best-selling landline phone. Sure, it’s not the most exciting of handsets but the main thing is it’s easy to use. The manual will prove invaluable when you first get set up, thanks to the easy to follow instructions. Meanwhile, day-to-day use is a cinch, especially thanks to those big buttons.We’ve been very impressed with the call blocking functionality too, which is a real bonus. In fact, if you don't use your landline all that much this might turn out to be its most useful feature as it deals with unwanted calls instantly. Similarly, the answer machine aspect of the BT4600 Big Button Phone is simple and effective, plus those controls on the base make using it very straightforward. All in all then this is a great package.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/bt4600-big-button-phone-review
35,Redmi Note 10 Pro,Redmi Note 10 Pro review: one of the best affordable Android phones you can buy,"The Redmi Note 10 Pro has to be in any conversation about the best cheap phones on sale at the moment – this is a handset that's available for not much more than a rock bottom price, but it comes carrying some decent mid-range specs and a lot in the positive column.There are compromises along the way, like a lack of 5G and wireless charging, but on the whole we've been impressed with the Redmi Note 10 Pro – and in our full review below, we'll tell you everything you need to know about this affordable Android smartphone.From battery life to camera quality, we'll take you through all the features that the Redmi Note 10 Pro has to offer, so you can decide whether or not it's the upgrade for you. If you want a refresher on what else you can pick up right now, check out our best phones guide.The Redmi Note 10 Pro is manufactured and released by Xiaomi, and it's available now in the UK: you can pick it up for £249 (with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage) or £269 (with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage). Check the widgets on this page for the best Redmi Note 10 Pro deals on the web at the moment, but you can also pick up the handset direct from Xiaomi or from Amazon.We're rather impressed by the lightness and the smooth curves of the Redmi Note 10 Pro, even if the glass back is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. There are hardly any signs that this is a lower-priced handset, and the silver ring on the rear camera module is a nice touch, even if the camera bump on the back is a little on the large side. On the front, the only interruption on the screen is a small punch hole notch for the selfie camera.That screen is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the Redmi Note 10 Pro overall: it's a 6.67-inch, 1080 x 2400 pixel AMOLED display running at a rather impressive 120Hz refresh rate, which means that animations, menus, scrolling webpages, games and everything else look super-smooth. It's a display that we like a lot: it's big, offers plenty of brightness, and has respectably thin bezels, though (as you would expect) it's not quite on a par with the flagship handsets that Xiaomi and its competitors put out in terms of colour vibrancy and sharpness.It feels as though the 120Hz refresh rate is there to give the display at least one premium spec – because otherwise it's all rather ordinary and standard. As we've said though, we do like it, and it's one of the better options you're going to get at this price point. We tested it with everything from watching movies to scrolling through websites to playing Android games, and the screen more than passed the test every time.You get some stereo speakers here that can actually pump out a decent level of noise at a reasonable quality – and speaking of noise there's a 3.5 mm headphone jack included too, up on the top of the handset. The phone is IP53 rated, so it's protected against splashes but not full submersion, and it comes in three colours: Onyx Gray, Glacier Blue and Gradient Bronze. Data transfer and charging is handled via USB, while the fingerprint sensor is embedded into the power button on the side of the phone.The Redmi Note 10 Pro camera setup certainly catches the eye on paper: we've got a 108MP wide + 8MP ultrawide + 5MP macro + 2MP depth rear camera on the back here (with video recording up to 4K at 30fps), and a 16MP wide selfie camera on the front. The snaps we took with the rear camera were pleasing, on the whole, with good colour reproduction, well-balanced contrast and fine levels of detail.There's no optical zoom, but there is ultrawide, and the mode squeezes more into a scene without any noticeable distortion or colour shifting. If you're looking for photos that are going to shine on your social media feeds then the pictures captured by the Redmi Note 10 Pro will do the job very well indeed, and for a phone that's priced as it is we think the end results are better than you might expect.Low light performance is less impressive, but it's not the disaster that it is on some handsets around this price point. You can usually get a decent result, especially if you enable the dedicated night mode (and keep the handset steady for a few seconds) – we noticed more blurring and more noise in the dark, but most of the time we think you'll be satisfied with the results.Battery life is definitely above average based on our testing, with the phone easily getting through a whole day – and often having around half of its juice left by the evening, as long as you're not pushing it too hard. In our two-hour video streaming test, with the display set to maximum brightness, the battery dropped from 100 percent to 85 percent, suggesting 12-13 hours of playback overall.The Redmi Note 10 Pro is certainly no slouch when it comes to the internal specs you get. The phone runs a capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 732G chipset that's paired with 6GB of RAM and up to 128GB of internal storage (a microSDXC card slot if also available to expand the storage if you need to). Those aren't top-level, flagship phone specs, but they certainly offer plenty of performance for the price you're paying, and keep everything running on Android nice and smooth.We had no problems with day-to-day smartphone tasks, and didn't notice any lag or slowing down when switching between screens and apps. This phone isn't running a top-level CPU though – in terms of performance it's perhaps the very definition of mid-range – so you're not going to get the very fastest frame rates or the very slickest app experiences that the flagship phones can give you.Unfortunately our usual Geekbench 5 benchmarking app couldn't complete its tests, which makes us think there are some gremlins under the hood of the phone that will hopefully be sorted out in future updates. We were able to run a couple of more demanding games on the phone, which all performed well and didn't lead to too much in the way of excess heat around the back of the handset.It's worth bearing in mind that the phone doesn't come with 5G, so you'll be limited to 4G if you pick up this handset – not a huge hardship for most people at the moment we don't think. The phone comes with Android 11 on board, with Xiaomi's own MIUI 12 software on board – MIUI has its own particular quirks (why do we have to see ads after installing apps from the Play Store?), and it's a bit too cartoonish and fancy for our own particular tastes (give us stock Android any day), but you won't have any major problems using it.Check the widgets embedded on this page for the latest prices on the Redmi Note 10 Pro, but at the time of writing you can get the 6GB and 128GB spec phone for £269 in the UK. That's something of a bargain considering everything that you get – the 120Hz screen, the decent processor, the very capable camera. Yes there are compromises of course, but the phone does enough to make you forget about them.There's no 5G here, no wireless charging, and no IP68 waterproofing. The camera and the screen are good, without being particularly great. These are the considerations to weigh up when you're thinking about whether or not to spend a little bit more money – there are a lot of great phones at the next price point up from the Redmi Note 10 Pro, so as always we'd recommend taking a long look around to see what else is available.We can say that the phone was mostly a pleasure to use, whether it was powering through day-to-day tasks or taking photos. It feels well built and looks well designed, and don't forget that battery life – something else to put in the positives column. In terms of value for money this is no doubt one of the better phones we've reviewed in recent times.Every smartphone has to be judged against its price, and in that regard it's a definite thumbs up for the Redmi Note 10 Pro from us. Despite a few minor issues – including slightly annoying software and performance that we were unable to benchmark with apps – on the whole this is a phone that gives you a lot of bang for your buck. If you're in the market for one of the best cheap phones around, give this a look.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/redmi-note-10-pro-review
36,TCL 20 Pro 5G,TCL 20 Pro 5G review: a smartphone with curves in all the right places,"Dimensions:  164.2 x 73 x 8.77mm

5G: YesIn this TCL 20 Pro 5G review, I’ll cover everything from its design and display, to its camera, battery life and performance to try and answer three all-important questions: has TCL found a way of standing out against the mid-range smartphone crowd? Is the TCL 20 Pro 5G worth parting with your cash for? And how does this handset compare to the best Android phones you can buy?Despite first being known for TVs, TCL has very quickly managed to build themselves a solid reputation for their mid-range smartphones in an already over-saturated market. When T3 reviewed the TCL 10 5G, the conclusion was that while ‘it does give you 5G and a good-looking phone for not much money. Perhaps the biggest problem for the phone is that there are so many other excellent handsets available at the same price.’Earlier this year, the brand unveiled their new TCL 20 5G phone which combined mid-range specs at a budget price. Following on from that, the TCL 20 Pro 5G takes aim at those willing to spend a little more, to get a more impressive handset in return. Read on to find out if the TCL 20 Pro 5G is worth your time and money.Its predecessor the TCL 10 Pro wowed us with its attractive price point, excellent OLED screen and decent battery life but it lacked a few features we have come to expect like 5G, wireless charging and water resistance.This time around, the TCL 20 Pro 5G includes both 5G support and wireless charging, as well as building on what came before it with an improved chipset, upgraded display tech, a new camera system, more storage and a sleek new design. Unfortunately, you still don’t get protection against splashes and spills.Unveiled on the 14th April 2021, the TCL 20 Pro 5G is available now. You can pick up a handset for £499 in the UK from sites like Amazon or Very. It will be coming to the US as well in the coming weeks, that pricing hasn’t been confirmed but it’s likely to be around $690. We haven’t heard anything about availability in Australia yet.One of the most good-looking phones I’ve seen this year, the TCL 20 Pro 5G has a glossy finish on the glass back coating. It comes in blue and grey colourways, of which I saw the blue.Long and thin is the best way to describe the shape of the TCL 20 Pro 5G. Measuring 164.2 x 73 x 8.77mm and weighing 190g, you won’t have any problems using it with one hand, even if yours are on the smaller side. The glossy design does make it a little slippy to hold, though most people would get a protective case for it anyway. Unlike so many other handsets, the camera module is completely integrated into the back of the phone, it doesn’t stick out at all. With lenses placed in a line down the left-hand side, it’s nice to see something a little different.On the front, the 6.67-inch AMOLED display is almost bezel-free, it has a 93% screen-to-body ratio with a tiny hole-punch camera in the centre at the top. Curved edges make this phone’s display look really clean, smart and more premium than it is. In use that did mean the edges of the keyboard were curved too, making mistyping quite common. Despite that, with FHD+ 1080 x 2400 pixel resolution, 394ppi and 16.7M colours, the screen is a marvel.All-new NXTVISION 2.0 is built-in which uses AI visual enhancement to recognise the type of on-screen content or scenes and automatically adjust the colours, contrast and sharpness. Watching videos, in particular, you can really see the difference with it turned on. It gives a much stronger contrast between light and dark areas while colours were enhanced and finer details looked more precise. Plus, it supports HDR10 for streaming TV and movies. Having a 60Hz refresh rate means that although it doesn’t feel quite as smooth to use as other pricier handsets, I still enjoyed scrolling through content on it.To unlock the handset you can use the in-display fingerprint sensor, it’s aligned well with where your thumb naturally sits on the frame. I found it worked quickly and reliably, no problems to note there! The Smart Key on the left of the frame lets you assign a few different actions to it, according to how you want to use it. I had one press set to turn NXTVISION 2.0, double press to launch Google Assistant and a long press to launch the camera and found myself using it quite often. On the right of the frame are the volume controls and power button, with USB-C charging on the bottom and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top.The TCL 20 Pro 5G packs a 48MP Sony OIS camera, 16MP ultra-wide-angle lens, 5MP macro lens and a 2MP depth sensor. On the front is a 32MP selfie camera. It can record video in resolutions up to 4K at 30fps.Photos came out looking crisp if a little bland at times. Snaps would have looked more satisfying if the colours had been boosted slightly with better contrast. Zooming into the snap, I also noticed that they lacked detail. Having said that, the shots did come out nicely when you pick the right focus point in the right lighting. It did deliver good depth when it came to landscapes and cityscapes in particular. The selfie camera is worth shouting about, especially with the beauty mode switched on, shots came out looking flattering and clear.Using the Super Night Mode, you can see from the gallery above that it didn't do a great job at illuminating the scene or improving the photo. It doesn't even compare to the Night Modes offered by pricier smartphones. The Macro Mode, however, is great. It managed to show off the fine lines and minuscule details on my cactus, maintaining its lush green colour, and even a little dust.Under the hood is the mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G chip, the Adreno 619 GPU, 6GB RAM and 256GB of storage. That’s quite a bit more memory than you usually get, and there’s a MicroSD card slot to expand it further.The TCL 20 Pro 5G coped well with everything from photo editing to mobile gaming, though was clearly not able to run as fast as handsets that cost twice as much, sometimes suffering from a bit of lag in mobile games. In Geekbench 5, it scored 656 in single-core and 1,985 multi-core, similar scores to other mid-range handsets like the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G and the OnePlus Nord. These scores were also almost identical to the TCL 10 5G.Naturally using the 750G chip means it has 5G support, fantastic if you live somewhere where you can make use of that. Speaking of connectivity, the TCL 20 Pro 5G only has Wifi 5 which is worth bearing in mind if you have invested in a Wifi 6 router at home, you won’t be able to make the most of it with this handset.The TCL 20 Pro 5G has a large 4,500mAh battery. I tested it out by playing a video stored on the device for two hours on full brightness, in that time the battery dropped by 10% suggesting it would have lasted 20 hours in total, that’s impressive for a mid-range handset. In the box, it comes with an 18W charger, TCL claim it’ll take two hours to recharge the battery to 100%, hardly the lightning speed I’ve become accustomed to. It does support 15W wireless charging though which is a bonus.Running Android 11 with the TCL user interface, the TCL 20 Pro 5G comes with loads of apps pre-installed that you may not want, like Booking.com, which is pretty irritating when you power on the phone for the first time. You can delete them so maybe that’s just nitpicking. Any skin that isn’t straight-up Android 11 will undoubtedly have a few annoyances, I personally don’t mind TCL’s - it’s tidy, smooth and intuitive.Looking for a phone that costs less than $700/£500, you’ll feel absolutely swamped by the choices. Deciding which to go for will come down to what you want your phone to do. Do you need an outstanding camera? Are you a busy person looking for good battery life? Is it a large display you care about?  The TCL 20 Pro 5G will be best used by someone looking for a sleek handset with a  stunning display for streaming video and a very long-lasting battery.While the camera is okay, you may be someone who wants fantastic shots to use on social media in which case there are better options out there. Or, if you are big on mobile gaming, you’ll be after faster performance and a higher refresh rate than what you get here.All-in-all though, despite having a few downsides, the TCL 20 Pro 5G is still one to watch. It may not have significant stand-out features but this is still a very capable smartphone. The large curved display is its crowning glory, yet it's the reasonable price tag that makes this a very convincing option.If you love the idea of a 5G Android phone with a beautiful display, but need a solid camera as well, consider the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G. It’s a strong entry in T3’s guide to the best cheap phones, only beaten at the time of writing by the OnePlus Nord and the Apple iPhone SE.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/TCL-20-Pro-5G-review

5G: YesTo summarise this Samsung Galaxy A52 5G review: this is a mid-range Android handset that doesn’t skimp on its main camera. It may not be the most powerful but it does include some high-end features you wouldn’t expect to see on an affordable Samsung phone.Samsung is a trusted smartphone manufacturer renowned for its innovative flagship handsets with powerful performance, clear as day camera systems and stunning displays. However, their top-of-the-line devices come at eye-watering prices.To cater for those who aren't willing to spend an arm and a leg on a smartphone, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G offers that familiar Android experience paired with more modest specs, for much less money.In 2020, T3 reviewed its predecessor the Samsung Galaxy A51, and it’s safe to say that we were impressed. The previous iteration of this phone featured in our guide to the best cheap phones you can buy, so I expected to see great things from the new and improved version.Direct from Samsung, you can pick up the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G for $349.99 in the US, £399 in the UK and AU$749.00 in Australia. It's available from retailers like Amazon too, so take a look at the widgets for the best deals available now where you are.Samsung has made some serious improvements to the phone, so how is the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G a step up from the Samsung Galaxy A51?To name a few of the changes: the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G has an updated processor, IP67 water resistance, more RAM, a new 64MP main camera lens, a bigger battery and 25W fast charging. Following the market trend, it even has a 120Hz refresh rate. They’ve also made 5G the standard as opposed to being optional.I’ll go into more detail about the differences later on in this Samsung Galaxy A52 5G review.Sporting a 6.5-inch display, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G has the same rectangular shape as what came before it, it’s available in four colourways: black, blue, white and violet. You’ll find the power button and volume controls on the right-hand side of the frame, with a USB-C port on the bottom, sat alongside a 3.5mm headphone jack. The back of the phone has a smooth matte plastic casing, the camera module merges really well with the overall design, despite sticking out a little. An unexpected benefit of this phone is that it’s IP67 spill, splash and dust resistant, giving you peace of mind.Looking much like its pricier flagship sibling, the Samsung Galaxy S21, there are a few design aspects that give it away as being a cheaper alternative. For one, the bezels are thicker with 84.1% screen-to-body ratio, which actually means they’re thicker than on the A51 as well. Secondly, the hole-punch camera on the front is framed by a small silver circle, making it blend in less naturally with the screen. Third, measuring 159.9 x 75.1 x 8.4mm. It’s significantly thicker than a lot of other handsets. I have small hands and found that my thumb couldn’t quite reach the other side of the display, making using it with one hand a bit tricky. It still has a MicroSD card slot for those who need it.The Super AMOLED display is largely similar to the Samsung Galaxy A51, it’s the same size and has the same 1080 x 2400 FHD+ resolution. One big change is the refresh rate, Samsung have upped it to an impressive 120Hz giving a silky scroll and for mobile gamers, in particular, a much smoother experience. You could be fooled into thinking the display belongs to a much pricier device. It has 800 nits brightness, making it look bright and vibrant. In looking more closely, you’ll see that it’s not as sharp or clear as top-tier flagships, despite that I found it to be sufficiently detailed to comfortably watch videos or browse the web. The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G also now has Corning Gorilla Glass 5 so will be more drop resistant than its predecessor.To unlock the handset, you can choose between password, pin, pattern, face unlock or fingerprint. The in-display fingerprint sensor was pretty reliable, it didn’t work every single time but on the whole, it did work quickly. One niggle I had was that it was placed a little too far down the display, not at the height your thumb would naturally sit.An impressive array of cameras, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G has a 64MP main lens, a 12MP ultrawide lens, a 5MP macro lens and a 5MP depth sensor as well as a 32MP selfie camera.For a mid-range handset, I was blown away by the quality of shots using the default point-and-shoot settings: they looked sharp, had bright colours and an excellent balance between light and dark areas - my shots looked lovely. Then, I tried out the macro mode, the camera struggled to focus on the subject. When it finally figured out what I was trying to capture, the result was actually quite good. Admittedly, the camera system was less impressive using the ultrawide mode and digital zoom, matching up more to other similarly priced handsets. On both of those modes, it lost out on detail and struggled more with contrast. To see how the camera fared, take a look at the gallery below.The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G has plenty of camera modes to try out, including the Single Take mode which takes a variety of clips and photos from the scene so you can pick the best one to use. Other camera modes include a food mode, macro mode and night mode. The night mode did a good job to brighten the scene, though didn’t quite manage the level of detail you would get from other phone cameras.Video can be filmed in resolutions up to 4K at 30fps, I tried it out with the Super Steady video mode. Lacking sharpness, video footage wasn’t quite as effective as still shots, yet it does do a great job to prevent shaky hands from ruining your filming.The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G uses the mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G chipset, alongside 6GB RAM and 128GB of in-built storage.After having tested this phone out for a while, I noticed that despite coping well with everything, it wasn't as fast as the highest-performing handsets. Opening large apps wasn’t always instantaneous and games took a bit longer to load, for instance. On Geekbench 5, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G scored 645 in single-core and 1,919 in multi-core, clearly showing that spending less money does ultimately mean you get less power. Comparing it to other affordable phones, it roughly matches up to handsets like the TCL 10 5G or the OnePlus Nord.With 5G packed in, you’re guaranteed fast internet speeds outside the house, if you live in an area supporting it. Surprisingly, it runs on Wifi 5, so you won’t make the most of a Wifi 6 router with this phone if that’s what you have at home.Running on Android 11 with One UI 3.0, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G uses a colourful Android skin with larger icons. My personal opinion is that it feels more childlike than straight Android, yet that does make it incredibly easy to navigate. As you would expect from any Samsung phone, it is a smooth overall experience.A 4,500mAh battery means that you get long-lasting usage from the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G. I ran a video on full brightness for two hours, in that time, the phone’s battery dropped by 14% meaning it would have lasted over 14 hours in total. Good going for a mid-range device. It supports 25W fast charging however you will have to buy the right charger to make use of that if you don’t own one already.In T3’s review of the A51, we had noted that the phone’s speaker was ‘a bit of a let-down, creating a tinniness that is especially jarring at higher volume’. Another area with a massive improvement, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G uses a dual stereo speaker as opposed to the single speaker on the previous iteration. It meant the audio quality was massively improved, I happily used it to watch video content, and didn’t find it distorted the sound at all.Everyone knows that if you want a phone that has it all, you’ll need to spend big. But what if you just want some of it? Although the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G may not give you best-in-class performance or a completely bezel-free display, it does deliver some unexpected top-tier features including water resistance, 120Hz refresh rate as well as a 4,500mAh battery.For point-and-shoot photography, it was superb. Granted ultrawide shots weren’t so impressive but as I say you can’t have it all for less than $350/£400. It’ll be well suited to those who want to take decent shots of people, landmarks and landscapes without the hassle of switching between camera modes. Plus, the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G will be a good choice for those who want a large screen and long battery life for the daily commute.The best cheap phone for most people will still be the Apple iPhone SE (2020) which delivers fast performance and a near-flagship camera system. If you aren’t an iOS lover, then other phones to consider could be the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G or the Google Pixel 4a both of which feature in T3’s guide to the best Android phones and have excellent cameras too.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a52-5G-review

Battery: 4,500mAhThere's a reason why the OnePlus 8 Pro has sat in T3's prestigious best phones guide for an entire year. That's because it was fantastic phone that delivered ""mind-blowing speed and performance"" along with the ""best display ever shipped on a smartphone"".There was one thing, though, that wasn't ideal on the OnePlus 8 Pro, and that was the fact that its camera system, while good, was clearly beaten by the majority of other flagship phones. T3 called this out and our verdict still stands to this very day.But that is why for OnePlus fans this OnePlus 9 Pro review will read well, as the Chinese firm has really tried to rectify that weakness this year with a renewed focus on its flagship's camera system.A partnership with camera masters Hasselblad has seen the OnePlus 9 Pro come with a camera system co-developed and tuned by them, with the handset delivering the Hasselblad Camera for Mobile system.The OnePlus 9 Pro release date is March 31 in the UK, while in the USA the phone debuts in stores on April 2. The phone was officially unveiled at the OnePlus event held on 23 March, 2021, and pre-orders are live now.The OnePlus 9 Pro price is $969 / £829 / AU$1,250 for the 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage space variant. The 12GB / 256GB of RAM variant, which is the model tested here, costs $1,069 / £929 / AU$1,400.In contrast to the OnePlus 9 Pro, the OnePlus 9 starts at $729 / £629 / AU$950, so you're paying a couple of hundred dollars extra for the Pro variant. That extra spend is largely confined to a higher resolution screen and a slightly more feature packed camera system.The OnePlus 9 Pro features a camera system co-designed by photography experts Hasselblad.The star attraction this year on the OnePlus flagship is the new Hasselblad Camera for Mobile camera system. This system has been co-designed with the photography experts and tuned by them, and it makes use of selection of quality Sony image sensors as well.Camera systems have traditionally been the weakest aspect of OnePlus phones, so this partnership with Hasselblad seems purposely done to address that deficiency. I mean, the cameras on OnePlus phones haven't been bad, but they've never been best in class, and both OnePlus users and critics have called them out on this in the past.And, after my testing, while I still don't think the OnePlus 9 Pro's camera system is the best on the market, it is a marked step forward and puts the handset on par with the best on the market today, such as the beastly setup included on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, as well as others such as the Huawei Mate 40 Pro and Google Pixel 5.Detail and accurate color reproduction are excellent.As can be seen in the image above, as well as in the image gallery below, the OnePlus 9 Pro's 48MP main rear camera, which uses a Sony IMX 789 sensor, in partnership with a 50MP IMX766 ultra-wide means that capturing subjects and the environment is easy.Detail is high, there's a very strong macro mode, and in a marked improvement over past flagships, color accuracy and reproduction is now flagship level. Low-light performance remains good if not Huawei-level best in class.There's also a dedicated monochrome camera on the OnePlus 9 Pro, too, which works largely as a support snapper to add extra detail and layering to any black and white photos you may take.The OnePlus 9 Pro also comes with a 8MP telephoto lens that offers up to a 3x optical zoom, and again while the level of zoom can't compete with the impressive but rather gimmicky 100x zoom of the S21 Ultra, it does allow strong levels of zoom and I feel it is totally useable in an everyday way.The two image galleries below show the OnePlus 9 Pro's zoom in action. The first shot is taken with the ultra-wide, the second is a standard un-zoomed shot with the main snapper, the third is at 3x optical zoom, and the final shot is at the system's 30x digital zoom limit.As you can seen the subject in both galleries remains clearly visible when zoomed in on, however, just like with all phones today, the quality of the image deteriorates rapidly when you stray into digital zoom territory.The OnePlus 9 Pro also has a 16MP front selfie camera, which makes use of a Sony IMX741 sensor. Selfie quality is high, but again in my opinion at least Huawei and Samsung phone offers slightly better results in this department. The bokeh in portrait mode is subtle, though.A selfie with portrait mode off, and then with portrait mode on.In terms of video recording credentials, the OnePlus 9 Pro can record at up to an 8K resolution at 30fps, a feat which puts it right up there with the best phones on the market. As we've mentioned before in phone reviews, though, while 8K is nice to have, right now 0.00001 per cent of the global population have 8K TVs or monitors, so the ability to shoot in 8K isn't very practical right now. Still, it's nice to have the ability in the OnePlus 9 Pro's armory.The more practical shooting modes on the OnePlus 9 Pro include 4K at up to 120fps, and that would be my recommendation for users. 60 or 120fps 4K footage is far more useable that 8K 30fps.Throw in optical and electronic image stabilization, a bunch of cool shooting modes like slow mo, nightscape, tilt shift, panorama, pro and time-lapse, as well three different aspect ratios to capture in, and you've got yourself a very feature packed camera system.This year OnePlus really seems to have nailed the hardware, software and feature package on their flagship, and for that they should be congratulated. Both casual and professional camera users alike will get on well with the OnePlus 9 Pro.The OnePlus 9 Pro's Warp Charge is top-tier charging tech.In terms of hardware, simply put, the OnePlus 9 Pro is very much an iterative evolution of the OnePlus 8 Pro. The display on last year's OnePlus 8 Pro was the best in the world at the time of its launch, and this year the quality remains very high, with a 6.7-inch, QHD (1440 x 3216), 525 pixels per inch, 120Hz, OLED AMOLED display delivered.The screen is an absolute beauty still, and also now comes with an advanced adaptive refresh rate technology which, depending on what the phone is being used for, can drop the refresh rate on the fly down to as low as 1Hz to save battery life. The idea is that when viewing photos, for example, you don't need the screen firing on 120Hz, so why not save energy.[CPU test]Single-core: 1,087
Multi-core: 3,510[Compute]OpenCL: 4,654
Vulcan: 4,340After testing the phone, I think this adaptive refresh rate technology is great as you don't notice it shifting the refresh rate, and considering that the phone's battery (4,500mAh) returned a good if not great battery life over our real-world two-day test, clearly it will keep you from running to a wall socket every few hours to charge the device.That said, if you do need to charge the phone then OnePlus really does have you covered with the OnePlus 9 Pro. That's because the phone comes with its 654-watt Warp Charge wired charging, which simply put is phenomenal. This can charge the the phone from empty to full charge in just 29 minutes!And, what's more, for lovers of wireless charging, the OnePlus 9 Pro also comes with support for 50-watt wireless charging, too, which can charge the phone to full in just under 45 minutes. As such, providing you've got a charger with you, it's always easy to keep the OnePlus 9 Pro well charged.All this said, though, next year I'd very much like to see a larger battery stack in the OnePlus flagship.Wild Life: 5,832
Sling Shot Extreme: Maxed out!
Sling Shot: Maxed out!In terms of specs and performance, the OnePlus 9 Pro is powered by the current Android flagship processor, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 and this, in partnership with 12GB of RAM and UFS3.0 storage, meant the flagship performed very well in both our Geekbench 5 and 3DMark benchmark tests.The OnePlus 9 Pro returned CPU scores in Geekbench 5 of 1,087 in single-core performance, 3,510 in multi-core performance, and 4,654 and 4,340 respectively in terms of compute OpenCL and Vulcan tests. This comes in just under the scores posted by the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, but right at the top of the Android phone charts.Meanwhile, in 3DMark the phone was so fast that it actually maxed out both the Sling Shot and Sling Shot Extreme benchmark tests, which is something that not even the S21 Ultra could manage, and posted a very healthy average frame rate of 34.10fps in 3DMark's Wild Life test.Unsurprisingly this led to buttery smooth and rapid performance in apps, games and the phone's UI.Lastly, in terms of performance, as you would expect from a flagship phone in 2021, the OnePlus 9 Pro comes with a 5G modem, so anyone who lives in an area with a 5G network can make the most of next-gen super-fast data speeds and low latency.In terms of software, the OnePlus 9 Pro comes running Android 11 and OnePlus' own OxygenOS skin, the latter remaining one of the lighter and more intuitive skins on the market today. OnePlus has always had a borderline Apple-level of understanding when it comes round to usability and intuitiveness in its handsets, and unsurprisingly it has not lost this knack overnight.The OnePlus 9 Pro is a good looking phone.Again cementing the fact that the OnePlus 9 Pro should be considered an evolution of the OnePlus 8 Pro is the fact that its design is very familiar. That's no bad thing, though, with the phone looking premium and feeling so in the hand. Metal framing joins a glass front and back, which the curvature of the screen is sharp (to maximise useable real-estate) and blends into the aluminium 2.2mm frame seamlessly.Round the back the new Hasselblad camera array sits vertically in an oblong array and looks classy. This camera array doesn't meld into the framework like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, but doesn't protrude too much and is finished with neat silver detailing that makes it standout in a good way. Attention has clearly being paid here, which is something I like to see as not every user wants to hide their phone in an engulfing, fugly case.And with the OnePlus 9 Pro available in three attractive colorways, including Morning Mist (the model reviewed and pictured here), Pine Green and Stellar Black, the reasons to not hide the phone away have if anything increased with this handset. It looks and feels great, so if you are going to put it in a case then be sure to make it a good one.Other than that, in terms of design it is business as usual for OnePlus here. You've got your power button and silent mode slider on the right hand edge of the device, a USB Type-C charging port and SIM card slot on the bottom (there is no microSD card slot on this phone, so no expandable storage option), and a volume rocker on the left hand edge.Overall, the OnePlus 9 Pro is a visually appealing phone that feels well made.So, the OnePlus 9 Pro is a superb all-round phone then and, naturally for such quality device, it is very easy to recommend.While the OnePlus 9 Pro is very much an evolution of the OnePlus 8 Pro, rather than a wholesale refresh, the fact that once again OnePlus has listened to its users and improved on the areas where it is weakest, has really paid dividends.The camera system has been one of the weakest aspects of OnePlus phones for good long while now, and T3 has called this out multiple times. The camera systems have been decent to good, but never best in class and rarely comparable with the finest flagship-grade rivals on the market.And, OnePlus really needed to fix this as its modern flagships like the OnePlus 9 Pro retail for truly flagship price points. And when users pay flagship money then flagship results need to be delivered. There can be no more ""well, this feature isn't great, but the phone costs hundreds less than true flagships so we'll give it a pass"". Now OnePlus is eating at the top table with Samsung, Huawei and Apple, and the high standards its products need to be held to should be the same.Luckily, that Hasselblad partnership has really injected the latest OnePlus phones with a huge dose of camera heritage, and the results speak for themselves.There are a few caveats though to an instant OnePlus 9 Pro purchase, though.Firstly, the OnePlus 9 Pro is very similarly specced to the OnePlus 9, so my advice is to really weigh up if the benefits you get with the Pro really are worth it to you. The OnePlus 9 is also a superb phone and costs markedly less than the Pro, so you could get a very similar experience that is perfect for you and save money at the same time.And, secondly, for the money you're spending here to land the OnePlus 9 Pro, pretty much all other flagship phones are now on the cards. OnePlus for years has had value on its side, with its flagship phones often undercutting the major players by a noticeable amount. That is largely how it got its reputation as a company that produced ""flagship killers"". Now, though, while OnePlus is absolutely making better phones, indeed they are some of the absolute finest phones on the planet, that undercutting on value is markedly reduced.Pick up the model that I have reviewed here, which comes with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space, and you're going to have to drop $1,069 / £929. That is a lot of money and it is money that can bag you the latest Samsung Galaxy or Apple iPhone.Rivals and price aside, though, the OnePlus 9 Pro is fantastic phone that now delivers across the board like never before. It not only delivers insanely fast speeds and powerful performance, as well as stunning design and suite of advanced features, but it also delivers a truly flagship camera system and experience. As such, if you're looking for a superb new Android smartphone, the OnePlus 9 Pro will definitely not disappoint.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-9-pro-review
39,Moto G100,Moto G100 review: perfect for being productive,"Dimensions: 168.38 x 73.97 x 9.69mm

5G: YesFor this Moto G100 review, it’s first worth pointing out that you don’t just buy into the phone here. You buy into what comes along with it, that being its Ready For system. Ready For is a platform that allows you to expand your Motorola phone onto any TV or display, I’ll go deeper into that later.Motorola is one of the most trusted, dependable smartphone manufacturers out there. Every year, they bring out well-priced smartphones with top-notch features and decent specs, so they’re a regular when it comes to T3’s guide to the best cheap phones.Moto G is one of their most popular series offering good performance alongside a quality camera. Here at T3, we’ve previously been impressed by the Moto G 5G Plus which offered a fantastic screen and mid-range processor, as well as 5G for those on a budget. Marking the 10th handset of the series, the Moto G100, claims to be their most powerful G-series phone yet, but it’s also their most expensive.I’ll get down to the nitty-gritty in this Moto G100 review and will cover everything you need to know about it.The Moto G100 will be available soon in the UK and Australia, but there's no news of a US release at the moment. It will set you back a respectable £450 which is roughly $620 or AU$820.The Moto G100 is a big phone, it has a 6.7-inch display and measures 168.38 x 73.97 x 9.69mm, it’s thicker and wider than a lot of other phones, so this may not be the handset for someone with small hands. Holding it in one hand, my thumb couldn’t reach the opposite edge of the screen. Adding to the overall clunky feel, the Moto G100 is heavy too, weighing 207g. You get the choice between two colours, iridescent sky and iridescent ocean. I saw the iridescent sky, from some angles it shimmers in blue and from others, purple. If you are after a funky phone that will catch people’s eye then the Moto G100 will definitely do that.Having such a big LCD display will make for fantastic viewing, the resolution sits at 2520 x 1080 FHD+ making it look super clear, it supports HDR10 and it has a 90Hz refresh rate. Although it won’t offer the absolute smoothest experience there is, for a more affordable phone it’s pretty good going. With an 85% screen-to-body ratio, the bezels are slightly thicker than other handsets, but you soon get used to it. In the top left corner of the screen, are two hole punch cameras, the main selfie camera and an ultrawide too. On the back, the square camera notch has four lenses, three of which have a shiny blue border around them. Motorola has done a good job at making them look the part, while not having them stick out too much.On the sides of the phone, you’ll find a dedicated Google Assistant button, volume controls and the fingerprint sensor which doubles up as a power button, it’s placed way too high up the frame so wasn’t the most convenient way to unlock the handset. There’s also a USB-C charging port and 3.5mm port.In the box, you don't just get the usual phone, case and charger, you also get a dock and Ready For cable. There are also a clear protective case included.Motorola has packed in a 64MP main lens, 16MP ultrawide, 2MP depth sensor and a TOF (Time-of-Flight) scanner, as well as a 16MP main selfie camera and an 8MP ultrawide front camera. Having six cameras does seem to be a little overkill but actually, after seeing the quality of the photos, it makes sense. Motorola isn’t known for having great cameras on their handsets, but this one manages to take quite good photos considering.You can see from the photos in the gallery below that the images are bright with vibrant colours and a good balance between light and dark areas. The ultrawide lens did a good job of fitting more in without losing out in quality, and the 10x digital zoom wasn’t so bad either. One thing that the Moto G100 struggled with, were photos in low light. They hardly picked up any detail, didn’t do much to brighten the scene and they looked massively grainy.It’s not winning any prizes for the best smartphone camera, and if you look really closely, you can see that the level of detail isn’t anywhere near on par with the best smartphones you can buy. However, for someone who just wants to be able to take quick shots that look decent enough, this will work just fine.When it came to video, the Moto G100 can shoot in 6K UHD at 30fps, 4K UHD at 30/60fps, FHD at 60/30fps), in slow motion FHD (120fps) or HD (240fps) as well as being able to shoot ultrawide videos in 4K and FHD. In giving video recording a go, I found they came out looking very shaky, even when I was stood still.Using the high-end (but not highest end) Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 processor and the Adreno 650 GPU, alongside 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, the Moto G100 claims to have ultra-powerful performance. Its Geekbench 5 scores match up to much more expensive handsets like the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra 5G. It scored 971 in single-core and 2879 in multi-core. I must say, it did feel fast and didn’t suffer any lag while gaming. With 5G support, you’ll get super-fast web browsing, if your area has access to it. And it has Wifi 6 to keep the speeds up when you’re at home too.Running on Android 11 without many significant tweaks, it’s a pleasure to use and feels close to a pure Android experience. Naturally, being Motorola, they have added their own little touches including gesture controls like swipe to split (the screen) or pick up to silence.Now looking towards the 5,000mAh battery - over two hours of video on full brightness, the Motorola G100 dropped by 16% so for a full charge, you would get about 12.5 hours of video playback. It’s likely that the powerful processor and high refresh rate contribute to such an average battery life.The Ready For functionality comes hand-in-hand with the Moto G100. By hooking up the phone to a TV or monitor, you can extend it into a desktop experience. I’m not convinced it will replace laptops but it’s a nice idea. You will even be able to use a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard with it, if you don’t have one, the phone can double up as the trackpad. Stream shows, get some work done, feel more immersed in a video call or play your games on a bigger screen, though you’ll need a controller for the latter. Best suited for productivity like creating documents or checking emails, it offers similar functionality to something like Samsung DeX, but through a wired connection.Having such a high-end processor, as well as shipping with the Ready For dock, means that this is less of a budget phone and more of a mid-range device. For those who will make use of it for work or play, it could be well worth it, but for others, it might be off-putting.Focusing purely on the handset, it really does deliver on speed, so will be good for those who use their phone a lot. You can take decent enough shots and despite being a little on the clunky side, the Moto G100 does have a great aesthetic as well as a clear bright, display and decent battery life too.Overall from this Moto G100 review, the key takeaways are that it’ll be good for those who don’t want to spend a fortune on a new phone, but who also need versatility and fast performance.If you are looking for a smartphone that can be expanded into a desktop view, you should also consider Samsung phones. Starting from the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy Note 8, their phones support Samsung DeX which wirelessly extends the phone onto a TV, monitor or computer.For those who are more focused on having an affordable phone with impressive performance, it could also be worth considering the Apple iPhone SE (2020) or the Google Pixel 4a.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/Moto-G100-review
40,OnePlus 9,OnePlus 9 review: a well-rounded smartphone to rival the big players,"Dimensions: 160x74.2x8.7mm

5G: YesComfortably earning a spot as one of the best smartphones and one the best gaming phones, the OnePlus 9 demonstrates OnePlus’ commitment to their Never Settle mantra.Since 2013, the Chinese company has attempted to produce handsets that will rival the big players in the industry like Apple, Samsung and Huawei. The OnePlus 8 got the closest they've ever been but still didn't quite cut it in comparison.One of the most anticipated launches of 2021, the OnePlus 9 is their next attempt at levelling the playing field. It features an upgraded chipset, a bigger battery, 120Hz refresh rate, a new Hasselblad triple camera system as well as some fresh camera modes to go with it. On paper, the OnePlus 9 looks fantastic, so did it live up to its impressive specs?I've been putting the OnePlus 9 through its paces to bring you a detailed review of everything from its design, display and camera to its hardware and overall performance.After launching on the 23rd March 2021, the OnePlus 9 became available for pre-order from oneplus.com. You will be able to buy the phone on April 26th 2021 from outlets like Amazon.Prices start from $729 in the US and £629 in the UK (about AU$940) for 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. In the UK, you will be able to get the 12GB RAM, 256GB storage version for £729 (about AU$1070). Unfortunately for Aussies, it's unlikely they will be able to buy this smartphone locally as OnePlus rarely brings its phones Down Under.The OnePlus 9 weighs 192g and measures 160 x 74.2 x 8.7mm. Thinner than the OnePlus 8, it's more comfortable to hold for most people, also helped by its slightly curved back. Those with small hands may still find it pretty big to use but not impossibly big. The phone comes in three colourways: Astral Black, Winter Mist purple and Arctic Sky blue. I got my hands on the Winter Mist variant, the purple reflective glass on the back of the phone looks sleek and shiny, though is prone to fingerprint marks.Completely flat, the front of the phone has slim bezels and an edge-to-edge display that's only interrupted by the front camera which is discreetly tucked into the top corner. On the rear, the three cameras are located in the top left corner. The rectangular notch does poke out a bit, it's annoying if you use it on a flat surface and may get caught sliding in and out of your pocket but it does look the part.On the right side of the frame is an alert slider to quickly switch between Silent, Vibration and Ring mode. Below that is the usual power button, and the volume controls are on the left. There’s no MicroSD card slot in the OnePlus 9, and it charges through the USB-C port at the bottom of the phone. To unlock the handset, there’s an in-display fingerprint sensor as well as face unlock. I thought both worked almost instantly every time I used them.The OnePlus 9 has a stunning 6.55inch FHD+ AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels at 402 ppi. You’ll quickly notice just how bright the screen is at 1,100 nits, as well as how vivid the colours are. There is an option in the settings menu to tone the colours down to more natural hues if you prefer.Like every other recent flagship, the OnePlus 9 has a 120Hz refresh rate giving a completely fluid experience when flicking through web pages or social media. To say that it feels smooth is an understatement, the silky feel can only truly be appreciated in games with frame rates higher than 60fps, like Minecraft. Discovering spots on Google Earth is another way to unlock the potential of the high refresh rate.In the box with the OnePlus 9, is the Warp Charge 65 adaptor, a USB-C to USB-C cable, the Quick Start Guide, a OnePlus sticker, a clear protective case and a SIM tray ejector. The OnePlus 9 comes with a screen protector pre-applied.Having partnered with Swedish camera manufacturer, Hasselblad, the OnePlus 9 takes a big leap up from its predecessor in its camera technology. On the back is a 48MP main camera, a 50MP ultrawide lens and a 2MP monochrome lens, with a Sony IMX766 sensor. On the front is a 16MP selfie camera. With the help of Hasselblad, OnePlus have created their new standard Natural Colour Calibration, making hues in photos appear more realistic.In testing this out, it did ring true, with sharp, crisp photos that look bright and accurate in natural light. Plus there's a great balance between light and dark areas. Admittedly, on a gloomy day, colours in the photos could have done with a bit of a boost as they came out looking a little dull, but in natural light the camera really does excel.The macro photography was a real-winner on this smartphone, it manages to pick up lots of detail from just 4cm away, giving you professional-looking shots up close. From the front selfie camera, you get excellent, detailed photos that will easily be good enough to use on social media. To see some of the shots I took, scroll through the gallery below.There’s no optical zoom here, so you just get the 10x digital zoom which crops the photo inwards. As expected, the 10x zoom doesn’t deliver photos you’ll want to print out and display, but you could just about get away with using the 5x zoom for decent shots.Portrait, Nightscape and Pro are just a few of the camera modes to choose from. They’ve also added in a new Tilt-Shift mode giving objects a miniature effect, OnePlus claims this will be best used for landscapes or cityscapes. It blurs out parts of the photo and keeps the focus on others. After giving it a go, I thought it did a better job at capturing smaller subjects rather than cityscapes, but it looked good both ways and is definitely worth using.If you want a decent point and shoot smartphone camera, the OnePlus 9 will bring out the photographer in you, and although not quite on par with the likes of the Apple iPhone 12, it’s not that far off either.Among the OnePlus 9’s many choices of video resolution, the very highest takes things up a notch with 8K recording at 30fps. You can also choose to shoot video in 4K at 30 or 60fps, 1080p at 240fps, in super slow motion or time-lapse. It also has “3-HDR” improving the dynamic range and giving you a much better view of both the subject and background of the video footage.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 1,118Multi-Core Score: 3,639[Compute]OpenCL: 4,603Vulkan: 3,949Under the hood, the OnePlus 9 is packed with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip with either 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage- easily rivalling other recent flagship smartphones. I reviewed the 12GB/256GB handset.On Geekbench 5, it scored 1,118  in single-core and 3,639 in multi-core, a boost on the OnePlus 8 Pro for sure and achieving similar scores to the Samsung S21 Ultra. I tried to slow it down, by having tons of apps and games open at once, but to no avail. The OnePlus 9 is a smartphone that delivers on speed.On top of that, there’s Wifi 6 and 5G connectivity for those who live in an area that supports it. If not, at least the OnePlus 9 will be future-proof and you will have speedy web browsing at home nevertheless.Running on the light Android 11 skin, Oxygen OS11, the user interface feels like a comfortable and familiar Android experience, with a few extra features to play with too. The Pro Gaming Mode is a superb example, it blocks out all distractions from other apps, reduces latency, improves app launch speed and increases performance overall. Well worth a go if you are big on mobile gaming. Another feature worth shouting about is the Dolby Atmos-enabled speakers which give you a punchy, rich sound that will be good for gaming, TV and music alike. You rarely hear a smartphone that sounds this good.A 4,500mAh battery is standard when it comes to higher-end phones, but other flagships do go beyond that. Over two hours of video on full brightness, the OnePlus 9’s battery level dropped by 14%, suggesting it would have lasted just over 14 hours from a full charge. But where the OnePlus 9 really blew me away was seeing just how quickly it charges up again. The new Warp Charge 65T adaptor means you get a full charge in just 29 minutes. Hopefully, that’ll mean the end of ever leaving the house with a low battery.  It also supports 15W Qi wireless charging, if you have the right kit for it.Taking a big leap in the camera setup, opting for the highest refresh rate and keeping up to date with the latest chipset gives this smartphone a serious shot at rivalling the likes of Apple, Samsung and Huawei.What OnePlus does really well is evolving its handsets based on the critiques of the last. Yet again, they’ve listened to both their users and the marketplace to make some major improvements in their 2021 flagship smartphone. It’s safe to say that I was impressed, there are still a few small niggles to be found like the lack of expandable storage, average battery life and mark-prone glass back but overall it’s an absolute pleasure to use and stunning to look at.If you’re after a flagship smartphone with all the best features but want to spend a little less than you would do on the most expensive options, it’s very easy to recommend the OnePlus 9.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-9-review
41,iPhone 8,iPhone 8 review: is this Apple iPhone still worth buying today?,"The Apple iPhone 8 has been on the market for almost four years and in that time there have been a few other Apple handsets to hit the market, including the iPhone 11, iPhone SE (2020) and iPhone 12.Even today the phone is still a superbly capable handset and despite the newer options offering better specs than the iPhone 8, they are a lot more pricey. The iPhone 8 is now retailing for some truly bargain-basement price points so the big question that is raised a lot right now is ""should you get the iPhone 8?""Well, that is what T3' Apple iPhone 8 review is here to help you decide. Here T3 breaks down each part of the handset's experience and tells you exactly what it is like to use, as well as bring you the very cheapest deals on it, too.The iPhone 8 measures 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3 mm. That's fractionally larger than the iPhone 7, but it should still fit inside an iPhone 7 case. It carries over the 4.7-inch screen (more on that later).That really puts the iPhone 8 in a league of its own, as there are no Android flagships with such a compact screen.The size makes it a pleasure to hold and use one-handed, which could be the killer reason to buy the iPhone 8 over anything else.Clearly, you don't get the bezel-less displays which the Samsung Galaxy S8 and iPhone X offer. That makes the iPhone 8 feel a bit more dated than its competitors.As we've already mentioned, the iPhone 8's design isn't a massive departure from the iPhone 6 and 7 aesthetic. That's not necessarily a bad thing, they're great looking phones.The aluminium unibody design has been replaced by a glass back (evoking the spirit of the iconic iPhone 4). This allows for wireless charging and should improve the wireless performance (that's what other manufacturers like HTC have claimed in the past).The glass back feels great, although, not quite as premium as the almost-ceramic metal case.It has a grippy coating that makes it feel more secure in your hands compared to other glass-backed phones. This is also helped by the extra weight, 148g vs 138g of the iPhone 7.We reviewed the white and silver model, which doesn't show any fingerprints, and we've also been using it without a case and haven't noticed any scratches yet.The camera lens still protrudes from the rear casing.Just like the iPhone 7 there's no headphone port. It's time to jump onboard the wireless bandwagon.The stereo speakers are now louder. It's a clear improvement ove ther previous iPhones, but lack bass for proper music listening. They do create a pleasingly wide soundstage.The iPhone 8 is water resistant, with the same IP67 rating. That means it should survive in 1 metre of water for up to 30 minutes.And finally on design - Apple have changed the colourways available. The iPhone 8 comes in Silver, Gold, and Black.The Gold is the standout here. It's much truer to real rose gold than the pink of Apple's old rose gold. The old iPhone Rose Gold is now discontinued.The iPhone 8 features a 4.7-inch 750 x 1334 IPS LCD display which has a pixel density of 326 PPI.That's the same number of pixels as the iPhone 7 (and the three year old iPhone 6). That's quite surprising, as we were expecting a bump in resolution considering some other rivals, now pack QHD screens (570 PPI for the Samsung Galaxy S8).If you hold them together side by side the difference is noticeable, but in reality, you won't be disappointed by the iPhone 8's resolution - it's plenty sharp enough.What Apple has focused on improving is the brightness and colour representation.Apple has added True Tone technology to the display. This monitors the ambient light around the handset, and calibrates the screen to perfect it under your current lighting conditions. This was first seen in the iPad Pro.It results in bold colours and beautiful contrast, without out looking over-processed, like some competitors.The iPhone 8 comes packing Apple's new and speedy A11 Bionic hexa-core (that's six cores) processor. It's the most powerful processor Apple has ever put in an iPhone.Now day-to-day it's difficult to notice this increase in power. Tearing through different apps, playing music, watching video, and checking emails are all uninterrupted by the hardware (as is usual for a new phone). What's super impressive is how instantly apps are ready when multitasking between numerous jobs, but that's something iPhones have always been good at.Where the added processing power will really become apparent is when running the more intensive apps (which use AR Kit, for example).Hopefully, it'll also stay quick for a lot longer, as well.Apple also simplified storage options, now the iPhone 8 comes with with 64GB, or 256GB.Apple claimed the iPhone 8's battery life was comparable to the iPhone 7, but we found it performed very well, far exceeding our expectations.Obviously, we're not talking a two-day battery life here, but we found it comfortably lasted a day with mixed usage.We've also got two new ways to charge the iPhone 8 - wirelessly and quickly (and yes, those are mutually exclusive).The new glass-backed design means that you can set the iPhone 8 down on a wireless charging pad and it'll instantly start sucking up juice.It's the universal 'Qi' standard as well, so you won't need a special Apple wireless charger for this to work.It's a nice touch and convenient, but at the moment it's rather slow. We found it very useful on a recent road trip which a Qi-enabled car, however.Also onboard is fast charging, but you'll need to buy an additional USB-C to Lightning cable and fast charger to unlock this.Ah, the camera - now this is where it gets interesting.On paper the iPhone 8's camera looks unchanged from the iPhone 7. You get the 12 megapixel f/1.8 lens setup as you did with the previous generation, but this year the sensor is larger and the software smarter.The result is a big improvement, with the camera now capable of taking some stunning shots with great detail and contrast.It's still not quite as reliable as the trusty Google Pixel or HTC U11, but it's narrowed the gap significantly.Check out these iPhone 8 image samples:It's still a shame you can't get Apple's dual camera system on the smaller phone, because I constantly feel like I'm missing Portrait Mode and Optical Zoom.The 7MP front facing camera is excellent, as is the 4K video at 60fps.The iPhone 8 is an excellent smartphone. The battery life is decent, the camera improved, and the addition of wireless charging adds convenience.We like the glass-backed design as well, and, thanks to the small screen it's one of the most ergonomic phones we've ever used.There's one X-shaped problem.The iPhone 8 is overshadowed by the more exciting, more expensive brother, and if you're looking for the latest, greatest iPhone ever released, you're going to want the iPhone X.Of course, the iPhone 8 is considerably cheaper than the £999 iPhone X, coming in a £699. And that's where our problem with the iPhone 8 lies, it's now the 'cheap' iPhone...Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm

5G: YesSamsung produces a lot of phones, but apparently, they hadn't quite covered the whole market just yet. There are still people to target, would you believe. So here we have the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, a phone with flagship-tier specs but at a lower price point than we’ve come to expect from premium devices.This is a phone that looks fantastic on paper, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it's everything it's cracked up to be. In this review of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, we take a deep dive to find out if it is actually worth spending your cash on.Samsung likes to do Android its own way, making them instantly recognisable -- especially from a software perspective. The S20 FE is no different, and is about as on-brand as you can expect from a Samsung flagship -- whether that’s the presence of OneUI 2.5 or the rectangular rear camera array that debuted on the S20.The screen is, as you might have expected, the S20 FE’s crowning achievement. While the resolution is limited to FHD+, rather than the S20’s QHD+, the 120Hz refresh mate makes it one of the nicest phone screens out there. The silky smooth motion is what really makes things work, and I’ve never seen Avenger’s Endgame look so good. And that includes watching it in 4K and at the cinema. HDR would have been nice, but that’s on Disney not Samsung.The 6.5-inch display is a bit of a tricky one. It skips the curved Edge display of most premium Samsung phones, which I’m always in favour of, but there’s still a touch more bezel than you’d expect. It’s only a few millimetres around the phone, but that’s enough to be noticeable if you’re looking carefully. Of course the holepunch camera is very small, the smallest Samsung has apparently, and that means you’re able to take great selfies without losing much screen space.Some criticism has been levelled at Samsung for swapping glass backs for a type of transparent glass called ‘glasstic’. While it’s true glasstic doesn’t feel as glossy and premium as actual glass, it doesn’t seem to make much difference in the grand scheme of things. Sure it would be nice for premium phones to go all in with the best features, but unless you’re really looking you won’t be able to notice much difference.Glasstic looks fine, it just feels and looks more like the matte surface that it is - rather than the glossy casings of more expensive Samsung phones.The only thing I’d change is the thickness of the camera bump, and the lack of a headphone jack. But that’s true of all phones, and isn’t going to change anytime soon.Long gone are the days of TouchWiz hell, and Samsung’s OneUI is an absolute joy to use. It’s smooth, responsive, and it’s very easy on the eyes. It’ll be an adjustment for anyone used to a different flavour of Android, but it’s not so different that it’ll take that long to master all the changes. As for long-time Samsung loyalists, there’s nothing you won’t already be familiar with - which is exactly the point of OneUI.One of the more unique features on the S20 FE is the 30x hybrid zoom feature -- the same as that on the S20 and Note 20. It’s not surprising that the S20 FE doesn’t offer the same level of zoom as the Ultra S20 and Note 20 phones, but it’s worth mentioning that 30x zoom is still a very long way.Long enough for the picture quality to seriously degrade at any rate, which seriously limits what you’ll actually be using the zoom feature for. As you can see in the images below, which took a picture of this solo country tower at various degrees of zoom.Poorer weather didn’t help things either, which is worth keeping in mind as we head towards winter.Of course if you do want hyper-zoomed in shots, Samsung still has the on-screen viewfinder to help you find what you want to photograph. Because it is incredibly easy to accidentally shift and lose your shot, and without it the feature would be impossible to use.Standard camera images work out a lot better, provided you limit yourself to the 3x zoom afforded by the telephoto camera lens. You can’t complain about the final quality, whether we’re talking about wider-landscape shots, close-ups of the trees, or even the stuff decorating the shelves in my office. But that shouldn’t be a surprise, since the S20 FE’s camera is almost identical to the one in the standard S20 - which we had very nice things to say about in our review.As for the selfies, there’s nothing to worry about where the foreground is concerned. Smaller details in the background come out a bit worse for wear, but since you’ll be the focus then that’s not such a dealbreaker. The foreground is as good as you could expect, but isn’t anything particularly special. Still that’s not a bad thing, whatever your selfie needs are.There’s no 8K video recording this time round, another consequence of the lower price, but unless you already shelled out for an 8K TV then this won’t be a huge issue. Especially not since it can record in 4K at 60 frames per second, and as you can see from our comparison video, that’s seriously better than a bog-standard FHD 30FPS shot.Any phone that is designed to cost less will inevitably compromise on the hardware in some way. The S20 FE has those compromises, but not when it comes to the internal hardware. The 5G model comes with the Snapdragon 865 which, while not as new or powerful as the recently released 865+, is still one of the best chipsets on the market -- and the same as the one in the rest of the S20 range. It also comes packing the Adreno 650 GPU, the same as the S20 and Note 20 ranges, and 6-8GB of RAM, depending on which model you buy.In other words, Samsung hasn’t been doing much in the way of downgrading, and your performance experience is identical to the other Samsung flagships.The hardware isn’t completely identical, but not in the ways that really matter. The S20’s ultrasonic fingerprint scanner has been replaced with an optical version, though it still works exactly as you’d hope from any fingerprint scanner. It’ll still have trouble if your fingers are dirty or not precisely placed, but that’s true of any optical scanner out there.All of that is great, but none of it matters if the phone’s battery is terrible. Thankfully it holds up rather well, even with the power-draining features like the 120Hz refresh rate switched on. The S20 FE is powered by a 4,500 mAh, which sits right in the middle of the standard S20’s 4,000 mAh and the S20 Ultra’s 5,000 mAh, and it seems to hold up fairly well to heavy use.Playing Pokémon Go for 90 minutes, at full brightness with the 120Hz refresh rate switched on, led to a 20% loss in battery life. At first glance that seems like a lot, but multiply it and you wind up with around seven and a half hours of usage. Pokémon Go is a notorious battery drain, so being able to get that much playtime out of it was a surprise. Not that many people could stomach playing it for that long anyway.That said, not having a terrible battery isn’t the same as having a great battery. The S20 could get you to and from work on a single charge, even with mid-level usage, but you’re going to have to plug it in for any evening activities. You can always switch off some batter-raining features, like the 120Hz refresh rate, but it seems counter-productive to buy a phone with premium features if you’re going to keep them switched off.Corners have to be cut to meet certain price points, but battery life should never be compromised in favour of something superfluous.One minor point to note is that the Galaxy S20 FE 5G does not support all 5G standards. Or rather it does not support the superior mmWave 5G that offers higher bandwidth -- and thus higher potential speeds. It’s not so much an issue in the UK, since there’s no mmWave coverage there, but if you’re in a country that does (such as the US) then you should know what you’re buying.Of course mmWave coverage is very limited, especially compared to the more common sub-6 5G that the S20 FE does support. So you’re not really missing out on very much.Finally, the most important change between the S20 FE and the rest of the S20 range is the loss of the Bixby button. Like the Note 20 range, Samsung has opted to let you summon Bixby by holding down the power button instead. That said if you don’t want to use Bixby, at all, you can reprogramme that gesture to open up the power menu - just like every other Android phone.The Galaxy S20 FE has an incredible amount to offer, taking the best parts of the Galaxy S20 range and packaging them into a slightly more affordable handset. Emphasis on slightly, though, because it is still considerably more expensive than other “affordable” phones from rival phone makers.But the fact is that the compromises that have been made aren’t particularly serious, so this is a phone designed for people put off by the more extravagant features (and pricing) on S20 and Note 20 handsets. Improvements could always be made, but that’s true of any phone.So if you’re looking for a premium phone that skips a lot of the fluff, and the resulting price inflation, the Galaxy S20 FE might be for you. It doesn’t matter if you’re a long-time Samsung user or you’re just looking for a change of scenery.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g
43,Oppo Find X3 Pro,Oppo Find X3 Pro review: one of the best Android flagships you can buy,"The Oppo Find X3 Pro is the new 2021 flagship from Oppo, and a successor to the very impressive Oppo Find X2 Pro. Like its predecessor in the Oppo range, the Find X3 Pro throws together just about everything you could want from a top-tier smartphone.From the glossy, premium design and powerful specs, to the very capable rear camera array and high refresh rate display, it's a flagship phone by whatever criteria you want to use. It aims to take on the likes of Samsung and Apple as one of the best phones of 2021.In this comprehensive Oppo Find X3 Pro review, we'll guide you through everything you need to know about the phone and what it's like to use. By the time you've finished reading, you should have a very good idea of whether this is the right handset for you.The Oppo Find X3 Pro goes on sale in the UK from 14 April 2021 and can be yours SIM-free and unlocked for £1,099 – that gets you 12GB of RAm and 256GB of internal storage. Most networks and retailers should be stocking the phone, and you can also buy it direct from Oppo if you prefer. It's a steep price, but we think the phone is just about worth it.In our opinion the Oppo Find X3 Pro is a fantastic-looking smartphone, with its glossy, mirrored back and refined curves – even the camera bump looks stylish. It's fair to say that the rear of the handset is something of a fingerprint magnet, and somewhat slippery to hold, but in terms of its pure aesthetics it's really impressive. We reviewed the gloss black colour option, but there is a blue alternative that gives a more matte finish, which might appeal more to you.The phone is nice and light and streamlined, weighing in at 193 grams and with a thickness of just 8.3 mm (that's 0.33 inches). It feels very much like a premium, flagship phone when you pick it up and use it, and one that's definitely able to hold its own against handsets such as the iPhone 12 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. The glass is nicely curved at the edges of the display, and the aluminium frame is a classy touch as well.In terms of the Oppo Find X3 Pro display we've got a vibrant, sharp 6.7-inch AMOLED screen here capable of displaying some 1 billion colours: it runs at a resolution of 1440 x 3216 pixels and can reach a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz, and it's difficult to find display specs that are better than that on the market at the moment. Images, videos and websites all look superb on this screen, and thanks to that high refresh rate, everything moves super-smoothly on screen as well.The screen is more than bright enough to use comfortably outdoors, and the bezels around the sides are hardly noticeable. There's a single punch hole notch up in the top left-hand corner of the screen as you look at it, which is the only interruption to the clean lines of the display, and like the phone as a whole the screen is one that wouldn't look out of place next to some of the best panels on the market at the moment.The phone comes with a power button on the right as you look at it, and volume controls on the left. You get stereo speakers, plus the now standard USB-C port for charging and data transfer, and there's a fingerprint sensor embedded under the display that we found to be accurate and fast in use. Rounding off the design specs, the phone is IP68 rated for water resistance, which means it can stand being submerged at depths of up to 1.5 metres for up to 30 minutes.Oppo likes to pay a lot of attention to the cameras on its handsets, and that's in evidence again with the Find X3 Pro. As well as a 32MP wide selfie camera, around the back the handset carries a quad-lens 50MP wide + 13MP telephoto (2x optical zoom) + 50MP ultrawide + 3MP macro camera that comes with a rather neat party trick: a 60x microscopic mode that lets you take an ultra-close look at fabrics, surfaces, skin, paper, phone screens, or anything else you like.Admittedly, it's a bit gimmicky, but it's also kind of cool – and we had plenty of fun with it, even if it might be the sort of feature you forget about after the first few days. It's certainly different, and we've included some samples below. Otherwise, this is a very capable rear camera, capable of capturing images in an instant that turn out well balanced, punchy and crisp in most situations.The 2x optical zoom and 5x hybrid zoom (a mix of optical and digital) work well at getting you closer to your subjects without much (or any) degradation in the quality of your photo, and it's the same with the ultrawide mode – you can rely on it to fit more into a frame without the distortion or colour shift that can creep in with some cheaper phones. Pictures do occasionally come across a little over-saturated, but on the whole we found ourselves very impressed with picture quality.The Oppo Find X3 Pro copes well with low light situations as well, even if you don't turn the dedicated night mode on – it'll often capture decent shots in the dark, without too much noise or blurring. With the night mode you have to keep the camera steady for longer, but it proves very capable at brightening shots in low light without making them look unnatural. It's another tick in the positives column for the handset.In terms of how much time you get between battery charges, we ran a two-hour video streaming test on the phone, with the screen set to maximum brightness and the volume at a low level. The level of the 4,500 mAh battery only dropped from 100 percent to 90 percent, which suggests you could squeeze as much as 20 hours of movie watching out of this phone before you'd have to recharge it again – that's definitely up there as one of the best results we've seen from this particular test.In more general use, the Oppo Find X3 Pro was also impressive in terms of the battery life it offered. This is one of those handsets that can genuinely get through not just one day but two days on a single charge, as long as you're not heavily using it – and if you add in super-speedy 65W wired charging and 30W wireless charging, battery life isn't going to be a problem for you on this phone. 10W reverse wireless charging for your smaller gadgets is also supported.If you want one of the fastest smartphones in the business, then the Oppo Find X3 Pro is going to serve you well: it comes carrying a Snapdragon 888 processor from Qualcomm – the top CPU for Android phones this year – as well as up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage (you can't expand that with a memory card, but then again you probably won't need to). Rounding out the rest of the specs, there is of course 5G here.In short, it's a powerhouse of a phone: that's backed up by Geekbench 5 scores of 924 (single-core), 3373 (multi-core) and 4594 (OpenCL). In terms of that benchmark at least, this is a handset that's on a par with the very best that 2021 has to offer in terms of smartphones – think the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, for example, which carries the same Snapdragon 888 chipset in the US. Games and demanding apps are no problem for this handset, and so it proved in our testing.No matter what we threw at the phone, it blazed through it with an impressive level of speed and responsiveness. We've got to the stage now where the best phones on the market offer significantly more power than a lot of apps are ever going to need, and that's certainly the case with the Oppo Find X3 Pro – and that also means it's going to be a long time before you need to upgrade as well.Even with dozens of browser tabs and multiple apps open, the handset didn't miss a beat during our testing, though we can't of course speak to what it's going to be like a year or two down the line. It's a particularly good device for mobile gaming purposes, because there's a gaming optimisation utility on board – and the combination of the internal specs, the large screen and the high refresh rate add to the appeal for gamers.The Oppo Find X3 Pro comes with the latest Android 11 on board, with Oppo's own ColorOS on top of that. The own-brand software isn't the worst we've seen, but we prefer the clutter-free experience of stock Android, on the whole. There are a few unnecessary extras, including a phone manager utility and a photo gallery that isn't really required when Google Photos is around, but we can certainly live with it (and as this is an Android phone, you can easily customise it to suit your own tastes).There's no doubt that the Oppo Find X3 Pro is going to cost you a significant amount of money: £1,099 in the UK at the time of writing, though if you check the offers embedded on this page you might be able to pick it up for less online right now. That sort of price can be a hard sell, especially with so many top-quality mid-range Android phones available on the market at the moment.However, you certainly get plenty back for the money that you're spending: while the rear camera on the phone doesn't go overboard in terms of its zoom capabilities, it is one of the best mobile snappers that we've seen lately, and the microscopic capabilities are certainly something different if nothing else. A lot of people are looking for a top-quality phone camera, and the Find X3 Pro provides it.In terms of the power under the hood then you'll struggle to find anything to beat this handset during 2021 – it's one of the best Android phones of the year when it comes to performance. Add in 5G and IP68 waterproofing and you're ticking just about all the boxes that you need to tick when it comes to a top-tier smartphone. Battery life is good as well, and charging speeds (both wired and wireless) are excellent.Phone design is always going to be something of a subjective assessment, but we find ourselves drawn to the polished curves of the Oppo Find X3 Pro – and there's little doubt that the 120Hz, 6.7-inch display is one of the best in the business at the moment. It's difficult to find anything major to complain about on this handset, even though you may baulk at the price.Finally, it's perhaps worth mentioning the other phones in the series, just so you can be sure that you're buying the right one: there is no standard Oppo Find X3 handset (at least not yet), but you can get variations on this particular theme from the mid-range 6.55-inch Oppo Find X3 Neo and the budget 6.4-inch Oppo Find X3 Lite (which both dial down the specs in terms of internals and the rear camera).",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oppo-find-x3-pro-review
44,Motorola Razr 5G,Motorola Razr 5G review: a great flip phone with a classic design,"Main screen: HD+ (2,142 x 876) 6.2-inch OLEDSecondary screen: SD (800 x 600) 2.7-inch OLEDCPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 765GGPU: Adreno 620RAM: 8GBStorage: 256GBBattery: 2,800mAhRear camera: 48MPFront camera: 20MPOS: Android 10The Motorola Razr 5G was launched hot on the heels of the first of the reimagined Motorola Razr in September 2020. Just seven months after its predecessor's launch in February.The upgrade makes a lot of sense, though. The first of the neo Razr’s came with a high price while offering a Snapdragon 710 chipset that would not only pale in comparison to the performance of the Snapdragon 865-based flagship phones launching in 2020 but also lack the 5G capabilities readily found on many of those phones.The Razr 5G steps things up considerably with a Snapdragon 765G that’s well suited for all that the phone is meant to do. It’s a speedy phone for most daily activities, and 5G support will help it stay relevant in the evolving network infrastructure of the coming years.Of course, the star of the show is the phone’s hinged design and flexible OLED display. Motorola did an impressive job building a phone that harkens back to the original Razr flip phone while coming with premium materials. Even though the display has some lumps and is plastic, it actually doesn’t feel like it falls too short of the best smartphones, especially since its bright visuals render those lumps all but invisible. And, that 6.2-inch display packs up into dimensions that take up way less space in your pocket than a typical smartphone.This won’t be the smartphone for everyone. It lacks a lot of the versatility of its competition, and a lot of the price tag is just accounting for the foldability. But, for those who just need a general-purpose phone and have the money to make it the coolest one, the Razr 5G is one of the best folding phones out there.The Motorola Razr 5G launched in September 2020 and carried a retail price of $1,399 / £1,399, which indicates plainly that it’s a premium device and that the unique foldable form factor isn’t one that comes cheaply. That said, Motorola has already begun to reduce the price, bringing it to a slightly more digestible $1,199 / £1,199.For the price, the Motorola Razr 5G includes an 18W USB-A fast charger, a USB A-to-C cable, and a USB-C-to-3.5mm adapter for headphones. The Razr 5G comes in rather curious packaging that isn’t just cardboard for the recycling bin. Instead, it comes packed on a display stand (unfortunately not a charging type) that can hold your Razr and even give it an audio boost through some sound porting at the bottom. All of the USB accessories come in a small case that can slot into the back of the stand.The Motorola Razr 5G’s whole premise is centered around its design and screen. They are the stars of the show. Foldable displays have been bandied about at CES and other electronics trade shows for years, but now we’re seeing them come to mass consumer devices (even if they’re in somewhat of a smaller niche).The Razr 5G is a showcase of the foldable display technology and a resurfacing of the nostalgic and iconic flip-phone design. At first glance, the Razr 5G hints at its roots rather loudly.Motorola went for a premium build wherever it could and managed a largely consistent design. The frame is built from 7000 series aluminum while the hinge is built from tougher stainless steel that stays consistent with the color scheme. Meanwhile, the back and front of the phone are covered in Gorilla Glass 5. Motorola offers three color variants, and the majority of the phone will stick to the selected color, but all three options have a black front panel that does detract somewhat from the uniform style, at least for the Liquid Mercury (gray) option.The front of the phone houses a small display, the primary camera and flash, as well as the power and volume buttons on its side. The back portion of the phone holds a fingerprint sensor near the hinge and the USB-C port, SIM slot, and loudspeaker at its bottom edge. Once the phone is folded open, the front and back of the phone both become the back of the phone (confusing, we know), and the flexible OLED display becomes the new front.The front of the open phone has a unique shape. There’s a large chin below the display, just like on the original Razr from years past, and the display itself has a curved top and bottom with a small notch cutout at the top for the phone’s earpiece and selfie camera. The aluminum frame of the phone comes up to the sides of the screen, slightly raised above it to create a small gap while the phone is closed.Half the fun of a flip phone is flipping it, and we can report the flipping is about half as fun as we’d hoped. The Razr 5G seems to be built so that its display gets gentler treatment than old school flip phones, so it doesn’t snap open and shut with quite the same panache (i.e., it’s a bit quiet). That said, it can still be flipped open with the same old wrist flick, and it will click shut.Taken in as a whole, the Razr 5G shows a careful and well-conceived design. But, up close, a few spots don’t suggest the level of precision we’d expect of such a premium device. For instance, the seams around the back glass panel and SIM slot are uneven, which is a bit worrying for a device with a water-repellant design and no IP rating. The hinge could also stand to hold the phone in its fully open position with a bit more force, especially as Moto Actions see the top of the phone flop about while open. The placement of the volume and power buttons, as well as the fingerprint scanner, also make them difficult to use.The ability to fold in half does make this one of the most pocketable phones on the market. While the Razr 5G measures 6.67 x 2.86 x 0.31in (169.2 x 72.6 x 7.9mm) unfolded, giving it a larger footprint than the Galaxy S21, it folds up to measure just 3.61 x 2.86 x 0.63in (91.7 x 72.6 x 16mm). That may be a little on the thick side, but it’s still mostly compact. In fact, it’s not too dissimilar to the classic Razer V3, which measured just 3.86 x 2.09 x 0.55in (98 x 53 x 13.9mm) closed.There are two displays to discuss on the Razr 5G. The external display is a 4:3 OLED panel with an 800x600 resolution. At 2.7 inches, it’s not going to do a lot, but it has enough space to show notifications and open quick settings or work as a camera viewfinder for selfies with the main camera. In a way, it offers some of the convenience of a smartwatch. This little display actually does a nice job blending in with the black frame around it, perhaps excusing Motorola’s choice to break from the rest of the device’s color scheme.The main display is where things get really interesting. This is a 6.2-inch OLED display with an HD+ resolution and 21:9 aspect ratio. In order to be foldable, the display couldn’t be made out of glass. So, it’s actually a plastic display. That may be a concern for long-term durability, but we haven’t noticed any issues in our time with the phone.The screen feels little different than using any other smartphone with a decent plastic screen protector on it. However, there are some minor bumps on the display around the hinge area. They are visible when there’s a glare on them and they’re easy to feel while swiping up and down on the display. We thought these might be a distraction, but they actually proved easy to overlook even while watching dark HDR content that really takes advantage of the OLED display. It really doesn’t feel like there were too many tradeoffs to make this display flexible besides the lack of glass. The display also gets bright enough for use outdoors on sunny days. Just don’t plan on using dark themes, as they’ll be more prone to distracting glare on the screen's bumps.The Motorola Razr 5G may not have the same specs as its flagship competitors, but it actually doesn’t skimp on much. Inside, it’s packing the Snapdragon 765G chipset and 8GB of RAM for capable performance and Sub-6 5G support. The phone is perfectly snappy in our everyday use, and our benchmarks of the device actually line up neatly with those we got from another Snapdragon 765G powered phone. With a single-core score of 606 and a multi-core score of 1872 in Geekbench 5, the Razr 5G actually just slightly edges out the OnePlus Nord.Launching apps, switching between them, pulling up videos, and rotating the display all go without a hitch. The one negative is that we can feel the phone warming up a bit when it’s working hard. This was most noticeable while running our benchmarks, and thankfully isn’t something that’s happened in general use.At its price, it may feel a little disappointing not to see a higher-end chipset in the phone, but the truth is that the Snapdragon 765G is likely the better fit for this phone. It wouldn’t take much advantage of all the capabilities of the Snapdragon 865 chipset given it only has one rear camera, doesn’t have the highest resolution display or an increased refresh rate, and really isn’t the phone you’d want for gaming, especially since the speakers are so easy to obstruct and somewhat grating at higher volumes.Motorola thoughtfully included 256GB of storage for this phone. This certainly helps for a phone at this price point, letting some of the other trade-offs sting a little less. If it had less storage, it would also sting more to find that the SIM slot doesn’t include a microSD card tray.The Motorola Razr 5G isn’t out to win any awards for its camera or battery life, and Motorola has a solid history of releasing phones with operating systems that stay very close to stock Android.The Razr 5G features a 48MP primary camera that uses quad-pixel binning technology to produce a 12MP image. This camera serves its purpose admirably, but it pales in comparison to the many shooting experiences on phones that cost considerably less, like the Galaxy S21 or iPhone 12.In everyday scenarios, it can capture fairly sharp detail, though shots get softer quickly if the light levels diminish. It can also achieve some nice, natural blur while taking close-up shots. It generally provides lifelike colors. We have noticed it occasionally gets the white balance off a bit, and it applies aggressive saturation when it detects food. The image stabilization is also on the weaker side, making it a little too easy to end up with a blurry shot if we’re not careful. Even the HDR could use a slight boost, as we’ve gotten large over-exposed areas in shots that other phones likely would have handled just fine. The lack of zoom or wide-angle sensors also limits the flexibility of this camera system.The front-facing camera is a 20MP number that uses quad-pixel binning as well. This sensor doesn’t serve much purpose beyond video call though, and it serves that purpose just fine. This is because the front-display makes it incredibly easy to take selfies or record video of yourself using the main camera.The 48MP camera does a decent job, overallEven in HDR mode, highlights are still lostFood shots can appear a little saturatedIt's easy to take a selfie using the main camera thanks to the front screenMotorola’s tweaks to Android 10 are all welcome and not overly complex. It has made the external display a useful tool that doesn’t just act like a tiny home screen, and the OS is effective at switching from the external display to the main internal one. Motorola isn’t responsible for much bloat either beyond its Moto Actions, which provide handy shortcuts to the camera, flashlight, and more. However, the model we reviewed came from AT&T, which had installed a considerable amount of extraneous apps.The battery may be the Razr 5G’s biggest shortcoming, as it’s a fairly diminutive 2,800mAh. We actually haven’t had trouble making it last the whole day, but we aren’t spending a lot of time on the go depending on a phone for everything. Since the phone also looks worse with dark themes, we can’t enjoy the battery savings they provide on OLED devices. That said, the small front display offers a battery-saving opportunity as it is handy for peeking at notifications, checking the time, and snapping a quick selfie without needing to light up the larger display.The Motorola Razr 5G holds up. It’s no heavyweight offering the highest-end internals or the most versatile features, but it earns its place by daring to be different – very different. It’s truly impressive how well Motorola has implemented a flexible display that actually feels close to the displays in its competitors. The phone has a high price for cool factor, as its cameras, chipset, and battery life certainly doesn’t justify the high price. But, for those who want a phone that’ll turn heads, there are few options like this. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip offers the most serious competition, offering an experience that lines up more closely with other flagship phones, but it lacks the iconic design and could benefit from the external display the Razr 5G makes clever use of.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/motorola-razr-5G
45,Apple iPhone 12 mini,Apple iPhone 12 mini review: top performance in a smaller form,"The Apple iPhone 12 mini is the smallest of four models in the 2020 range. While many were expecting this to be an SE model with reduced features, the 12 Mini offers near-identical specs to the iPhone 12 with only two real caveats: a smaller screen and a lower-powered battery.For many years, mobile phones battled to create the smallest, most compact devices but as smartphones came into play and web browsing became a thing, they started to grow again. iPhones have grown too over the years. The original iPhone was just 4.5in x 2.4in (115.5 x 62.1mm) with a 3.5-inch screen. With each case design change the size has crept up, while the Plus and Max models went bigger still, allowing for bigger and better screens. But is bigger always better for the best smartphone?The iPhone mini is the smallest phone Apple has released since the original iPhone SE in 2016 – a phone that shared the same case design as the iPhone 5S from 2013. The first SE gained a following not only for being one of the best cheap smartphones but one of the best small phones.With this year’s iPhone design returning to the squared-off look, there are clear similarities between the iPhone 12 mini and the iPhone SE. But rather than a lower-powered model, this is just as capable as its larger sibling, the iPhone 12, and still comes with a price saving.The iPhone 12 mini was announced on October 13 alongside the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Like the Pro Max, it wasn’t shipped until November 13 – three weeks after the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro were launched. The price of the iPhone 12 mini starts from $699 / £699 / AU$1199 for the 64GB version. The 128GB version is $749 / £749 / AU$1279, while the 256GB version is $849 / £849 / AU$1449.Many users will probably opt to spend the extra $50 to double their storage to 128GB, while the largest capacity is ideal for those that want to keep all their photos and video stored locally.Like the iPhone 12, the mini comes in a choice of five colors: black, white, (Product)Red, green and blue. This is one color less than the iPhone 11, with the yellow and purple options replaced with the new blue – though a brighter blue than on the Pro models.As with the other models, there’s no charger or headphones in the box of the iPhone 12 mini. As we’ve stated in the reviews of the other models, this isn’t ideal for new users but most Apple fans won’t really miss them. What it has meant is a much smaller box – one that’s little bigger than the phone in length and width – which is good for the environment, as well as, we assume, for Apple’s shipping and production costs.The iPhone SE (2016) and the iPhone 12 mini side by sideThe new flat-edge design does look great on the iPhone 12 mini. It’s almost a shame to put a case on it, as you instantly lose just how slim the device is and how tactile that glass back feels in your hands. However, as you’ll want to keep it looking good, we’d advise investing in one straight away. We used one of the Apple Silicone cases, which is very tactile.This year’s models do benefit from a new ceramic shield that protects the display, resulting in four times better drop performance than the iPhone 11. Meanwhile, the back glass has been strengthened to avoid chips or cracks. And not forgetting its water resistance, which now offers up to 30 minutes at depths up to six meters.Despite being significantly smaller in stature than even the iPhone 7 (which featured a 4.7in screen), the iPhone mini features a 5.4in display. This is thanks to a massive reduction in bezel over the years.MagSafe charging with the MagSafe Duo ChargerThe introduction of MagSafe charging to the iPhone is a big step and one that could eventually replace charging via the Lightning port. This system follows the same principals as the Apple Watch charging (and to some extent the old MacBook chargers) in that the magnets in the back of the phone align with those of the charger to hold it firmly in place. These magnets are powerful enough that they could hold the phone in place vertically – say in a car cradle or desk stand – but can be easily separated by hand.The MagSafe system also brings the option to quickly attach accessories to the phone, with full cases as well as card holders able to snap straight on to the back of the iPhone. The magnetometer and custom NFC sensors are able to identify which accessory is attached too. Charging is even possible through the attached cases.The iPhone 12 mini features stereo speakers, mounted in the top front and bottom edge of the device and is able to deliver a powerful volume without any serious distortion, even at full volume. Those users with AirPod Pro or AirPod Max earphones can enjoy the spatial audio playback, which makes the sound feel like it’s coming directly from your phone, even when you turn your head.The screen is one of the main areas that the iPhone 12 mini differs from the iPhone 12, though not as much as you might expect. The screen is smaller, measuring just 5.4-inches, compared to 6.1-inches on the 12, however, the resolution only drops from 2532x1170 to 2340x1080 pixels. This means that the sharpness is slightly higher on the 12 mini (476ppi compared to 460ppi).Resolution and size aside, the iPhone mini display has the same 2,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio, 1200 nit peak brightness and HDR support. The result is superb. Whether reviewing photos taken with the camera, websites or films the images have incredible depth and really vibrant colors. We watched Tiny World, which is broadcast on Apple TV+ in 4K with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound. Even on the small screen, the detail is crystal clear, and the wildlife really jumps out at you. While you may need to hold this screen a little closer than, say, the 6.7in iPhone 12 Pro Max, it’s still very watchable.We also tried out some new gaming additions from Apple Arcade, including Expedition and Mini Motorways. Thanks to the resolution, these were easy to play and it's easy to forget that you’re using a smaller screen. The only thing here for serious gamers is that the refresh rate is limited to 60Hz, while others now offer 90Hz or 120Hz for smoother fast-moving action.Zoomed in detail (right) from the rear wide lensFor video, the iPhone 12 mini can shoot in up to 4k 60fps and at up to 30fps in 10-bit HDR video with Dolby Vision. The colors really do look great on the footage and any camera movement is kept super smooth thanks to the optical stabilization in the rear wide lens.The camera set up on the iPhone 12 mini is identical to that of the iPhone 12. On the rear are dual 12MP cameras with an ultra-wide f/2.4 lens with 120-degree field of view and a wide f/1.6 lens. These are equivalent to 26mm and 13mm in 35mm terms. The wide lens also benefits from optical image stabilization to ensure a sharper shot.Apple iPhone 12 mini rear super wide lensApple iPhone 12 mini rear wide lensUnlike the iPhone 12 Pro models, there’s no third telephoto lens here and your file formats are limited to HEIC or JPEG without a ProRAW option. It’s fair to say though that we rarely missed the longer lens. The wider lens is ideal for groups and the front camera is your go-to for selfies. Arguably the ultra-wide lens is far more useful.The images both viewed on the phone and also on 24-inch desktop monitor, look really impressive. The detail available when viewed at 100% size is incredible, even from the more compressed HEIC files. At 200% there are some slight haloing and smudgy compression but that is to be expected, even from DSLR cameras. The exposure never misses a beat and the HDR functionality produces really natural results from high contrast scenes.The iPhone 12 mini's Portrait mode  does a great job of isolating the subjectThe portrait mode – used on both the back wide camera and the front camera – is really adept at separating a person from a scene and blurring the background. It’s certainly a quick and easy way to make a portrait stand out, and the addition of the lighting effects and aperture control give you even more creative control.The night mode works on both the front and rear cameras, taking multiple photos to build up the image and deliver a natural looking nighttime shot better than any camera flash could manage.The front camera is the same across all of the iPhone 12 models and remains unchanged from that on the iPhone 11 in terms of specs: a 12MP camera with f/2.2 lens. However, it does now feature Dolby vision HDR recording, deep fusion image analysis and Smart HDR 3.Speedtest results using 5G show really fast download speedsIf you really needed proof that the iPhone 12 mini is every bit an iPhone 12 you simply need to look at what’s inside. It too, features 5G, providing download speeds of 100 to 400Mb/s using the regular sub-6GHz 5G networks. The US model also works with the super-fast mmWave 5G that offers potential speeds of up to 1.8Gb/s. This faster mmWave connection is currently being rolled out in major cities across the US by all the major networks. UK and Australian networks are yet to offer this and iPhones in these regions don’t support it.We tested the speed of the iPhone 12 mini on T-Mobile’s network in Chicago and were able to reach download speeds of up to 482Mb/s. At that speed you could download a 4.7GB DVD in under two minutes.As 5G can be a little power hungry, there is the option to only use 5G when you really need it, and LTE, or 4G, for the times that you don’t. This option will save you battery life over the full 5G on setting, that will use 5G whenever it’s available.The iPhone mini also features the same A14 Bionic chip as the other three handsets. This is 20% faster than the A13 used in last year’s iPhone 11 range and is designed to deliver a more efficient performance. This means that it needs less power to run and can handle more tasks, such as the deep fusion image analysis. On a practical level it also means that everything runs smoothly, with zero delays on apps opening and plenty in the tank for many upgrades to come.MagSafe connectionWhen it comes to charging, the iPhone 12 mini can go from zero to 50% charged in under 30mins when using the 20W Apple charger, and to full charge in around 1.5 hours. Using the new 15W MagSafe wireless charger takes roughly three hours to fully charge, though this is still considerably faster than using regular Qi wireless charging, or an older 10W or 12W USB charger.Due to the smaller size of the iPhone 12 mini, the battery it uses has also been made smaller. And while it has a smaller display to power, this still results in shorter talk and view times than the regular iPhone 12. While the iPhone 12 offers 17 hours of video watching, the iPhone 12 mini gives you just 15. For audio only, rather than 65 hours, it provides just 50 hours.These figures are not bad by any means. It’s better than almost every iPhone before the iPhone 11, including both SE models, but it’s likely to be a consideration for anyone choosing between iPhone 12 models. In reality most of us put our phones on to charge each night anyway and even with heavy use it easily lasted the day.When the iPhone SE was first released, many were hoping for an iPhone mini. Instead, it was a cut down version of the iPhone 6. The iPhone 12 mini is a fully spec’d iPhone 12 in a smaller form. It uses the same processor as the flagship iPhone 12 Pro Max and the same great camera system as the full-size iPhone 12. It has 5G, face ID and a stunning screen, yet it’s small enough to operate with one hand and slip into the smallest pocket or bag.There are, however, a few compromises. The battery life is the shortest of the four new models and considerably less than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And though the screen is great quality, it is noticeably smaller than the 6.1-inch of the full-size iPhone 12. With this in mind, we wonder if the $100 / £100 price saving is enough to tempt people.That said, for those looking for a smaller phone, the iPhone 12 mini is the best option on the market right now. For those that simply need a top-quality phone for calls, browsing the web and taking photos, this is for you. For those that have a tablet at home or are rarely without a laptop, the iPhone mini makes sense.The beauty of the iPhone 12 line-up is that there is a phone to match your needs, and there’s also the iPhone SE, XR and 11, giving a price range of $399 to $1099 (£399 to £1099) across all seven models.While the iPhone 12 is obviously bigger than the iPhone 12 mini, it’s considerably smaller and lighter than the iPhone 11 while maintaining a 6.1-inch screen. It has all the same great features as we’ve seen here on the iPhone 12 mini with the advantage of that bigger screen for videos, gaming and web browsing, as well as an improved battery life. Read out full our iPhone 12 review.Keeping with smaller screens, the Google Pixel 5 features a 6-inch display and is slightly smaller in the hand than the iPhone 12. This 5G device has 128GB storage, 8GB RAM and Snapdragon™ 765G 2.4 GHz processor. There’s a great dual camera system on the rear and a punch hole camera in the front display. It also comes in cheaper, priced $699 / £599.The other way to keep the size down on your handset, is with a flip phone, and the new Samsung Z Flip 5G is proof that this category is back with vengeance. This resembles the flip phones of old but once opened up, reveals a folding screen, giving you a massive 6.9-inch. And the beauty is that when closed it measures just 3.44in by 2.9in (87.4x73.6mm). The Z flip features 5G, a 256GB storage and 8GB RAM. It also now costs just $649.99 unlocked.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/iphone-12-mini-review
46,Vivo Y70,Vivo Y70 review: a low-cost Android phone that won't let you down,"Say hello to the Vivo Y70, the mid-ranger in the collection of phones Vivo has recently introduced to the UK – if you want something more powerful, try the Vivo X51 5G; if you're looking to save yourself some money, on the other hand, check out the Vivo Y20s instead.We say mid-ranger, but the Vivo Y70 is more affordable than most mid-rangers on the market at the moment, so it sits somewhere between the mid-range and the ultra-budget sections of the market. Is it the ultimate in value-for-money Android smartphones though?Our in-depth review of the phone will answer that question, and should give you an idea of whether or not the Vivo Y70 deserves a chance as your next smartphone purchase: we'll cover everything from the display quality to the camera setup to the battery life on offer.The Vivo Y70 is out now and available to buy in the UK – check the widgets on this page for the latest prices online, but at the time of writing you can pick up the handset unlocked and SIM-free for around £280. You can buy the phone from several online retailers, including Box, Ebuyer, LaptopsDirect, Clove and eFones.On the whole, the Vivo Y70 is a decent-looking handset, for something at this price – it does feel a little flimsy and very plastic, but it's not unappealing in terms of its aesthetics. You can pick up the phone in Gravity Black or Oxygen Blue, and it was the latter that we had for our review unit: it's actually more of a white colour, but it has an attractive level of polish and shine to it, catching the light nicely as you move it around. The rear camera array is tidy and compact too, up in the top left corner on the back.There's a fingerprint sensor embedded under the screen here, which is something of a rarity on a phone this cheap, and you also get a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the bottom of the phone next to the USB-C slot for charging and data transfer. The standard power and volume controls are up on the right of the phone as you look at it, while the sides and the corners of the handset are subtly curved – you could argue that the Vivo Y70 looks a touch more expensive than it actually is.The overall dimensions of the Vivo Y70 are 161 mm x 74.1 mm x 7.8 mm (6.3 inches x 2.9 inches x 0.3 inches), so this handset can hold its own against some of the top phones on the market in terms of thinness. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, for example, is more than a millimetre thicker. If you decide to pick this up as your next handset, then we don't think you'll be disappointed in terms of its fit and finish.As for the AMOLED screen, it's a bit of a star: 6.44 inches corner to corner, with a 1080 x 2400 pixel resolution, the display is bright and vivid, with sharp details and colours that pop. This is another area where the Vivo Y70 can compete with phones that cost significantly more – while the refresh rate is stuck at the standard 60Hz, it's still a screen that we were impressed by. From browsing through photos to streaming video from the web, most content shines on this display.Despite the lack of ultrawide and optical zoom on the rear camera of the Vivo Y70, it's still a capable enough snapper, as long as your expectations aren't too high. With a fast shutter speed, the rear camera keeps picture noise down to a minimum, although the phone can struggle with images that have a lot of contrast in them. As you can see from the sample shots that we've included below, the phone can take some very nice pictures most of the time, as long as the conditions and the lighting are right.In the day, details are reasonably clear and colours are well balanced on the whole. At night the phone's triple-lens 48MP wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth rear camera falls down more often – the night mode does help, and can get you some usable images on certain occasions, but this is one area where the cost cutting on the handset is evident. Completing the camera setup, there's a 16MP wide selfie camera on the front, lodged inside a teardrop notch at the top of the display.When it comes to battery life, our two-hour streaming video test knocked the battery down from 100 percent to 84 percent, so you can expect around 12 or 13 hours of non-stop binge watching in total – that was with the display brightness ramped right up though, bear in mind. In general use, you can usually get a day and a half out of the phone; if you're really addicted to your screens, about a day of battery life seems to be standard.There's no wireless charging here, which is normal on mid-range and budget handsets, although there is 33W fast charging – enough to get the batter up to full from nothing at all in well under an hour. While the 4,100 mAh capacity battery is by no means the biggest you're going to find on the market, it keeps the handset going for as long as you need it to, and battery life isn't something you're going to have to worry about.With the mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor running the show, which has been around since 2019, you can't expect blistering performance from the Vivo Y70 – and that's borne out by the Geekbench 5 scores of 314 for single-core, 1362 for multi-core, and 386 for OpenCL – that's about half what you would get from an older flagship like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra or the OnePlus 7T.There is at least a generous 8GB of RAM on board here, as well as 128GB of internal storage which you can expand upon via the phone's memory card slot, should you need to. All that RAM helps multiple apps and browser tabs to stay in memory at once, and in general use you can get around the phone's interface with barely any noticeable lag or slowness. For most people, what the Vivo Y70 offers in terms of performance will be enough.Gaming poses some difficulties on the Vivo Y70, because of the modest CPU: it'll run every game you can find in the Google Play Store (as far as we could tell at least), but you might have to dial down the graphical settings or put up with a few missed frames on some of the more demanding ones. You're also going to have to live without 5G, which isn't a huge surprise on a phone at this price point.Vivo puts what it calls Funtouch on top of Android – Android 10 in this case – and while we're not quite as keen on it as pure stock Android, it's not the worst Android skin we've ever seen. Bloatware is limited to a handful of apps, plus TikTok and Facebook, which you can easily ignore or uninstall if you want to. Everything considered, the software is slick and easy to get around.The widgets on this page should point you towards the best Vivo Y70 prices on the web at the time that you're reading this, but at the time we were writing it, the phone could be had for somewhere in the region of £280. To put it another way, you're getting quite a lot of smartphone for not much money – while the handset isn't super-cheap, it's a notch below what you're going to pay for the likes of the Google Pixel 4a or the Apple iPhone SE.That said, if you can dig deeper and spend a little more then some of the excellent mid-range phones out there at the moment are going to give you levels of performance and results in terms of camera quality that leave the Vivo Y70 in the shade. It's all a question of where you want to find the balance between how much a phone costs and what you're going to get in return.The key selling points of the Vivo Y70 – besides that low price – are the large, bright AMOLED display and very respectable battery life. The triple-lens rear camera, while capable of getting some really nice shots, can also struggle in certain situations. For a camera attached to a sub-£300 smartphone, it's actually not bad at all, but this is one area where paying more for a phone is going to get you some serious improvements.In the end we rather liked the Vivo Y70 for the price. It doesn't exactly change the game for low-cost Android smartphones, but the design, the camera quality, the battery life and definitely the screen quality are better than you might think for something so inexpensive. That said, performance is on the weak side, and there's no 5G or waterproofing and wireless charging, so weigh up all the pros and cons before making a purchase.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/vivo-y70-review
47,Vivo Y20s,Vivo Y20s review: a super-cheap Android phone with long battery life,"With the ultra-cheap Vivo Y20s, Vivo continues its expansion into the UK (see also the Vivo X51 5G, a more premium-level device). It's a 6.51-inch Android handset that you can get for not much money at all, and which covers all the basics you need from a smartphone.If you're in the market for one of the best cheap phones available right now, then this is a handset worth considering: its affordability is just about its only stand out feature, but it is very affordable, and only a fraction of the price of the top-end flagships you can buy.The Vivo Y20s does make some compromises along the way to reach that price point, but certain trade offs aren't as drastic as you might think. In our full review we'll explain everything you need to know about the phone, from camera quality to battery life.The Vivo Y20s is out now and available to buy in the UK, unlocked and SIM-free, from retailers including Box, Ebuyer, and LaptopsDirect. Check the widgets embedded on this page for the latest online deals, but you can typically pick up this smartphone for less than £150, making it one of the cheapest handsets around.The 6.51-inch, 720 x 1600 pixel LCD screen that the Vivo Y20s comes with is perfectly fine without being close to dazzling: you won't mistake this for a premium OLED display. The 720p resolution is a little disappointing, but it does the job for watching movies, browsing the web, and flicking through photos. Note that there's no HDR here, so photos and videos won't be quite so well balanced in terms of their dynamic range.The bezels around the display are acceptably thin, and there's a teardrop notch up at the top of the screen. Otherwise, the Vivo Y20s looks reasonably stylish while also looking a little on the cheap side – the gradient shimmer sort of effect on the plastic back adds a touch of class, while overall the phone feels light and thin in the hand. It certainly won't weigh down your pocket or your bag.Your colour choices are Nebula Blue (like our review model) and Obsidian Black, and we like the aesthetics of both of them. While coming a long way short of the levels of polish and style you get on flagship or even mid-range devices, the Vivo Y20s doesn't embarrass itself in terms of design. The rectangular camera bump is quite pronounced, but that's now common across a lot of handsets.It's a shame that the VIvo Y20s sticks with the ancient microUSB technology for its charging and data port, which means you're still going to have to keep at least one of these cables around while everything else has long since moved to USB-C. The phone also puts the fingerprint sensor in the power button, which we find a bit on the fiddly side – your mileage may vary. There's also a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the bottom of the phone.Considering the low, low price of the Vivo Y20s, we weren't expecting much from the rear camera on the phone when we took it out for some testing. The resulting photos and videos actually aren't all that bad, and unless light is a problem or you're trying to snap something that's moving quickly, you can get reasonably good shots – balanced colours, on the whole, and a respectable amount of detail too.Specs-wise, we've got a triple-lens 13MP wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera on the back of the Vivo Y20s, and an 8MP selfie camera on the front. There's no ultrawide mode here, and no optical zoom, though the digital zoom works better than we expected it to (up to a 2x zoom level, anyway). As an everyday photo snapper, the Vivo Y20s just about does enough to keep most people happy.Low light is a bit of a problem, as you would expect from the specs we've listed and a lack of night mode in the phone's software setup. In really low light you won't get much of a photo back at all, and even if you do, blur and noise are noticeable (this is a long way short of the low light performance of the Pixel 4a, for example). If you want to be able to take photos and videos in any setting or situation, it might be worth spending a little bit more; if camera quality isn't much of a priority, you'll be okay with the Vivo Y20s.Battery life, meanwhile, is one of the highlights of the Vivo Y20s: the 5,000 mAh battery built into this handset is easily going to last you an entire day and may even get you through two if you don't push it too hard – it's that good. Our two-hour video streaming test, at maximum brightness, knocked the battery down from 100 percent to 84 percent, which equates to around 12-13 hours of video watching overall. There's no wireless charging option though, and wired charging tops out at 18W.The Vivo Y20s runs on a very modest Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor, which is combined with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage (which you can expand via a microSD card if you want to). Those are pretty low level specs, and while the phone is perfectly usable, you will notice slight delays in keyboards, menus and webpages opening up as you navigate around it. It's a phone that forces you to go at a steady pace.While casual mobile gaming is fine on the Vivo Y20s, more demanding titles can stutter and drop a few frames – there wasn't anything we could find in the Google Play Store that wouldn't run on the phone, but performance glitches do creep in when the handset is really being pushed hard. Low Geekbench 5 benchmarking scores of 252 (single-core), 1232 (multi-core) and 264 (OpenCL) back that up. To be fair, that's similar to other ultra-budget Android phones.These are performance trade-offs that you might be perfectly willing to make for getting a phone that costs so little, but you definitely need to be aware of them if you're thinking about purchasing the Vivo Y20s. It's also important to note that the phone doesn't offer 5G connectivity – definitely not a surprise at this price, but it's now becoming less and less common to find a new phone that doesn't offer more than 4G.On the software side, the phone runs Android 10 together with a skin that Vivo calls Funtouch. It's not bad, as far as Android skins go, and there isn't much in the way of unnecessary bloatware – a rather superfluous system management utility, a gallery app, an FM radio app, an app that's just a link to the Vivo website, and TikTok for some reason. Android 11 would be nice, but we've got no major software complaints.The Vivo Y20s is only really going to interest people who want to spend as little as they possibly can on a new smartphone, and in terms of affordability the phone is a five-star success. Whether it's better value for you than getting an older, second-hand mid-range or flagship phone is less easy to say, but if you like the look of the Vivo Y20s then it's not going to put a massive dent in your bank balance.The other big plus point here is the battery life, which is well above average and can quite possibly stretch to two days in some situations. We were impressed by just how long the Vivo Y20s lasted in our testing, and if you're looking for an inexpensive second phone that you can keep in a drawer for days on end then the Vivo Y20s would definitely fit the bill. It might also suit older or younger users who aren't too demanding when it comes to what they want from their smartphone.On the one hand, the price that Vivo is offering this phone at is fantastic, and it will run all the apps you rely on to a satisfactory level. At the same time, the phone is a touch slow at times, and the screen and the design aren't particularly impressive either. There's no wireless or fast charging here, no 5G, and no waterproofing, and if your budget can stretch a little bit higher then you can pick yourself up a mid-range phone that's a lot better.Assessing any smartphone means taking the price into consideration and weighing that against everything else, and in terms of value for money we think that Vivo has done a good job here – in smartphone terms this costs peanuts, and yet it holds up okay in all the key areas. There are a lot of compromises made by Vivo though, and we think most people would be better off saving up for a more expensive handset.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/vivo-y20s-review

5G: YesWelcome to T3’s review of the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus. Samsung led the way in 2020 as the biggest global smartphone manufacturer, making the January 2021 launch of the Galaxy S21 series one of the most anticipated of the year. The Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus were expected to be great phones and are certainly among the best Samsung phones on offer right now.To give a brief summary of the series, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is one of the best phones of 2021 but it comes at an eye-watering price. In comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus have somewhat scaled back specifications and are only a slight improvement on the Samsung Galaxy S20 and S20 Plus. Though what that has meant, is a range of more affordable flagship handsets from the Korean giant. If you are wondering what the difference is between the Samsung Galaxy S21 and the S21 Plus, it really comes down to the size of the display and the battery, both of which are bigger in the Samsung S21 Plus.In this review, we will answer all the questions you may have about the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus, and go through everything from the design and camera to the hardware.Want a top case for this phone? Then check out T3's best Samsung Galaxy S21 cases guide.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus is available to buy now. A SIM-free 8GB RAM, 128GB storage handset direct from Samsung will set you back $999 in the US, £949 in the UK, or AU$1,549 in Australia.If that won’t be enough storage for you, there’s also the 256GB version which you can buy from Samsung starting from $1,049 (£999 / AU$1,649). That’s cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus at launch, which started at $1,199 in the US, £999 in the UK, and AU$1,449.On contract, you can get the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus from various retailers including Vodafone from £48 a month, EE from £55 a month, and O2 from £58 a month. Prices will vary depending on upfront cost, length of the contract, the amount of data and minutes you need, and so on.See the widget below for the latest deals on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus.Design-wise, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus lives up to the company’s reputation for sleek and stylish handsets. It’s available in violet, black, and silver from most retailers, as well as gold and red exclusively from Samsung. We tested the Phantom Black, the deep matte black glass covering the back looks seriously smart. This could give it an edge over the Samsung Galaxy S21 which has a ‘glasstic’ back (a combination of glass and plastic). The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus feels more like what you would expect from a flagship smartphone and frankly, looks better too.The rear camera module is tucked into the top right and seamlessly curves around the edge of the phone, while the hole-punch front camera takes up very little space on the top of the display.As a whole, the large 6.7-inch AMOLED display is a joy to use and will be perfect for those looking for a larger screen than on the Samsung Galaxy S21. Following the trend set by the iPhone 12, it feels very flat in comparison to other smartphones, most of which opt for a curvier design. Not only does that make it look sharp and refined, but it helps to prevent accidental touches too. The 1,300 nits peak brightness improves the visibility of the display, which alongside the HDR10+ support makes for colourful and immersive video viewing. If the colours pop too much for your liking, you can change them to a more natural hue on the Screen Mode settings, where you can manually adjust the white balance too.Like other flagships hitting the market this year, the dynamic refresh rate of up to 120Hz makes playing games or flicking through web pages and social media feel silky smooth. What’s really great about this is that the phone will automatically adjust it between 48 and 120Hz according to what you’re doing which is great for conserving battery life.When it comes to the screen, it’s worth mentioning that Samsung has lowered the display resolution on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus to Full HD+ down from QHD+ on the Samsung Galaxy S20. This is one of the areas that helped to bring the price down this year. Luckily, you can’t see a massive difference from the naked eye and the lower resolution will be another factor that improves the battery life.The in-screen fingerprint sensor is 70% larger than on the Samsung Galaxy S20, making it faster and easier to use. It was reliable and successfully unlocked pretty much first time, every time.The camera system on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus isn’t really any different from last year’s S20 Plus. You get the same 12MP, 64MP telephoto, 12MP ultra-wide rear cameras with a 10MP front camera.Just like its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus produces great photos, with bright colours and a level of detail you can only truly appreciate by zooming right into your snaps or displaying them on a big screen. We would say that sometimes the colours are so vibrant that it’s a little unrealistic but that’s really nit-picking. The wide-angle lens does a great job at fitting more into the scene without losing any detail too.If you are a big selfie taker, you might want to consider the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra instead. It has a 40MP front camera, in comparison to the mere 10MP on this. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus does a good enough job, but it’s not anything special.With plenty of different shooting modes to choose from, you’ll always get the shot you’re after. Be it using the Food mode, Pro mode, or the Single Take mode which when you press the shutter button and move around, uses all the lenses to capture a variety of different shots to choose from. The Night Mode is another brilliant aspect of the camera. It illuminates the scene enough to look vibrant and detailed, and unlike other smartphone cameras, it takes only a matter of seconds to take the shot.It has a 30x Space Zoom which does a good job up until a point. You can see from the image gallery how it fared as we zoomed in. You won't get photos that you would want to use on social media past about 10x zoom, but it’s a great feature to have.You can film videos in resolutions up to 8k, admittedly useless for most but ensures the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus is future-proof. One feature we loved was the Director’s View, which simultaneously shoots video on the front and rear cameras- perfect for anyone keen on filming videos for social media.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 1,046Multi-Core Score: 3,471[Compute]OpenCL Score: 7,380Vulkan Score: 6,274You can buy the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. A significant disappointment in the S21 series is that you can no longer expand the memory using a microSD card.For US (and Korean) consumers, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus has the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset, while for everyone else it’s the Exynos 2100. The model we tested had the Exynos 2100. It didn’t struggle at all with any lag, even with the most demanding of mobile games. The speed was proved by the Geekbench 5 scores of 1046 (single-core), 3471 (multi-core) and 7380 (OpenCL). One note we did have on this was that the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus did get quite warm when it was working hard to download big files or playing more complex games.As expected the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus has 5G support on board. Though most will only be able to access 4G in their areas, it future-proofs the phone in preparation for when 5G is more widely available.Running on Android 11 with Samsung’s One UI 3.1, it has a quality of user experience matched by few other manufacturers. Menus and navigation are intuitive and good-looking, you can’t help but enjoy using Samsung’s devices.The 4,8000 mAh battery will definitely last you the whole day. Over two hours of video on full brightness, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus only dropped 12 percent battery. This equates to just under 17 hours from one full charge. It supports up to 25W fast charging, but it only comes with the cable in the box so you’ll need to use what you already have or purchase a charger separately. It also supports wireless charging.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus is stiff competition for smartphones like the iPhone 12 or the Oppo Find X2 Pro. The beautiful design, advanced features like wireless charging, countless camera modes, and strong performance are all factors that make this a great all-rounder. But if you currently own the Samsung Galaxy S20 or S20 Plus and are wondering if it’s worth the upgrade, it’s not. You won’t get much more in the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus than what you already have, especially when it comes to the camera.For anyone looking for a top-of-the-line Android phone with the most sophisticated features, we would recommend the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Having said that, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus is still an impressive handset that will satisfy the needs of most people, and at less than £950, it feels like pretty good value for money.These are the best Android phones on the market",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-s21-plus-review

OS: Android 11Welcome to T3's Xiaomi Mi 11 review. Xiaomi's newest flagship device is definitely a contender when it comes to the best phones in 2021. Going up against the likes of the iPhone 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S21, the Xiaomi Mi 11 has cemented itself into the top-tier with impressive specifications and a price to match.The Chinese company has continued to take big steps away from their usual mid-range smartphones with the Xiaomi Mi 11 and even managed to beat Samsung in the race to announce the first commercial phone with the new Snapdragon 888 under the hood.Not only have they upped their game when it comes to performance in the Xiaomi Mi 11, but in comparison to the Xiaomi Mi 10, you’ll notice significant changes to the display too. This includes an increase in screen size from 6.67-inches to 6.8-inches, increased pixel density as well as a much sought-after 120Hz refresh rate.In our review of the Xiaomi Mi 11, we’ll take you through everything you need to know about the phone from its design and features to its cameras and hardware.Sales of the Xiaomi Mi 11 have already started in China and are expected to reach Europe and the UK in March 2021. Xiaomi doesn't currently sell its phones in the US.So far, we know that there will be two versions of the Xiaomi Mi 11. The base version will have 8GB RAM with 128GB of storage. We do know that in Europe it will come in at €749, but no UK pricing has been confirmed yet. If you want more storage you will be able to opt for 256GB, setting you back €799.While the Xiaomi Mi 11 isn't available just yet, you can still get your hands on the Xiaomi Mi 10.In the box, the Xiaomi Mi 11 comes with the phone, a clear protective case, user guide, and a 55W charger. We’re getting a pretty good deal on the charger as it hasn’t been included in the Xiaomi Mi 11 box for the Chinese market.When it comes to the overall design, the Xiaomi Mi 11 looks the part. We received the Midnight Gray colour, but it also comes in Cloud White and Horizon Blue. There will be a Special Edition option of the Xiaomi Mi 11 too, but supposedly numbers of these will be very limited. The 164.3 x 74.6 x 8.1mm dimensions make the phone feel quite long and thin, which alongside the curved frosted glass back makes it lovely to hold. On the front, you’ll find Corning Gorilla Glass Victus which gives it top-of-the-line drop protection.The 6.8-inch, 3200x1440 pixel, HDR10+ supporting AMOLED screen is a marvel, proved by its A+ rating from DisplayMate. The colours look vibrant and thanks to the 1,500 nits peak brightness, you won’t struggle to see it in daylight. Mobile gamers will be impressed by the 120Hz refresh rate as well, and for others, that will mean completely effortless scrolling and swiping. Xiaomi has even included technology that upgrades low-resolution content to WQHD+ quality without increased data consumption.Weighing 194g, the Xiaomi Mi 11 is 12g lighter than its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi 10. But that still makes it heavier than other recent flagships like the iPhone 12 (164g) and the Samsung S21 (171g). It has quite a top-heavy feel because of the thick two-layered camera module on the back. Despite the module being smaller than on previous Xiaomi handsets, it’s still significant enough to make the Xiaomi Mi 11 a pain to slide into your pocket and hard to use the phone placed flat on a surface.There’s no headphone jack and it doesn’t come with a converter in the box, but considering most people have a trusted pair of Bluetooth headphones anyway, that’s not too big of an issue. The Harmon Kardon stereo speakers did a decent job playing music and TV without any distortion.Like the Mi 10, the Xiaomi Mi 11 has a 108MP main sensor which is huge. Alongside it, there’s a 13MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP telemacro lens. On the front of the phone, a 20MP selfie camera. One disappointment though is that there is still no optical zoom, the camera crops in to zoom instead.Whether you’re taking selfies for social media, landscape shots, or snaps of food you won’t be disappointed by the Xiaomi Mi 11. The triple rear cameras, in particular, are impressive and photos came out looking sharp with strong colours, it even coped well with dark and light spots. Having the telemacro lens is what makes this phone camera something to shout about though, to take the shot you don’t need to get right up close to the subject. Being able to keep a distance means you will be letting as much light in as possible, which helps retain the detail.Low light photography from the rear camera is pretty good. The Xiaomi Mi 11's night mode may take a fair few seconds to capture the image but when it does, it brightens up the subject well enough to prevent graininess and blur.Video on the Xiaomi Mi 11 can be filmed in resolutions up to 8k and comes with Ultra Night Video mode. There are some other fun AI modes too including Freeze Frame to make it appear as if your subject is frozen in time and Magic Zoom which makes the camera look like it’s simultaneously zooming in and out.Elsewhere, the 4,600mAh battery in the Xiaomi Mi 11 didn’t seem to last the day with the refresh rate set to 120Hz. Having tested it out over two-hours of streaming video on full brightness, it dropped by 36 percent suggesting that it would last less than eight hours altogether.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 1,041Multi-Core Score: 2,664[Compute]OpenCL Score: 4,630Vulkan Score: 3,985The Xiaomi Mi 11 was the first to announce a handset with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor- it’s paired with 8GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of storage. The 5nm chip is 5G enabled, and the device supports Wi-Fi 6 too, so you’ll always have seriously fast downloads and streams.For everyday use, we didn’t notice any lag, even with multiple apps open at once. The Xiaomi Mi 11 coped well with everything from making edits to photos to mobile gaming. This is backed up in its Geekbench 5 scores which were 1,041 (single-core), 2,664 (multi-core), 4,630 (OpenCL) which were similar to the scores reached by the Samsung S20 Ultra.As expected, Xiaomi put its MIUI software on top of Android 11 which we aren’t entirely keen on as it overcomplicates menus and settings, but if that annoys you enough, you can install a different launcher.The fingerprint sensor is incorporated into the display though it could be a little slow to unlock the phone at times. It’s also worth mentioning that it can also be used as a heart rate monitor- it won’t take a measurement when you unlock the phone though, you’ll need to launch the Xiaomi Health app.Xiaomi is fast becoming a tech company you can’t ignore. In the second quarter of 2020, they ranked 4th globally for smartphone shipments. As shown by the Xiaomi Mi 11, each of their smartphones seriously improves on the last which is probably why they are doing so well.  If you haven’t been convinced by Xiaomi handsets before, the specifications on this one might win you over. It certainly won us over, we would even go so far as to say it’s one of the best phones in 2021.The Xiaomi Mi 11 does have some downsides, like the average battery life and lack of IP rating, and granted you can find 5G handsets with much smaller price tags. But if you’re after a handset that looks and feels premium, with a strong camera and a CPU to be reckoned with, you won’t need to look much further than the Xiaomi Mi 11.The Xiaomi Mi 11 is expected to go on sale in the UK in March 2021, but if you just can't wait, take a look at the best deals for the Xiaomi Mi 10.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-mi-11-review
50,Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max,"Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max review: bigger, bolder, better","Having now spent considerable time with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, we take a deeper dive into its features and how it performs.With four models in this year’s iPhone range, there’s a choice of sizes and specs available to suit most users. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the true flagship, though. It’s the best iPhone, even among this year's incredible crop, and is absolutely one of the best phones you can buy today. Even compared to the regular iPhone 12 Pro, the Max offers a range of upgrades, not to mention that gigantic screen.Like the 12 Pro, the Max features the new flat-edge design, with a stainless-steel construction, a Super Retina XDR display and a textured matte glass back. It’s finished in a choice of four colors: graphite, silver, gold and pacific blue.Inside is the new A14 Bionic processor, which is the most powerful phone processor in the world. This works alongside a four-core GPU to enable impressive performances in gaming, augmented reality and video editing. It's the same as you'll find in the iPhone 12, and is just as fast here as there.Where this year’s iPhone Pro models stand out is in their camera systems. On the front is a 12MP TrueDepth camera for better selfie action, while the rear sports a three-lens camera array, providing you with ultra-wide, wide and telephoto options for photo and video capture.Perhaps the biggest addition to all of this year’s range is the 5G connectivity. This offers incredible download speeds when out and about, allowing you to live stream, download and video chat without giving it a second thought… as long as you're in a supported area, of course.The iPhone 12 Pro Max is a very expensive phone so be sure to protect it from scratches, cracks and dents with one of the best iPhone 12 cases.The iPhone 12 Pro Max was released on November 13, 2020, along with the iPhone 12 Mini. Prices start from $1099 / £1099 / A$1849 for the 128GB version. This is likely to be enough storage for most users, especially thanks to the phone’s ability to stream content fast.For those that want lots of local storage or plan to shoot lots of photos and video, Apple also offers a 256GB version for $1199 / £1199 / A$2019 and a 512GB version for $1399 / £1399 / A$2369.The base 128GB model is the same price in the US as the 64GB 11 Pro Max was on launch in 2019 and priced slightly lower in the UK and Australia. The larger storage versions are cheaper in all markets.Both the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max come in a choice of four colors: graphite, silver, gold and this year’s new addition, pacific blue. The blue replaces last year’s Midnight Green and is this reviewer's favorite. While the 12 also comes in a blue finish, the pacific blue on the 12 Pro models feels more premium.This year, there’s no charger or headphones in the box, but for anyone upgrading from an older iPhone, you probably have plenty of both still lying around the house. And of course, this is designed to be used wirelessly – both for listening and charging. While you can still plug in any lightning-fitted headphones – or 3.5mm with an adapter – most Apple fans have probably upgraded to a pair of AirPods already, or at least the new cheap Beats Flex.And for wireless charging, all iPhone 12 models are MagSafe compatible – a new magnetic charger that works much like the Apple Watch charger. MagSafe chargers are available for an extra $39 from Apple or increasingly from third parties.The new flat edge design of this year’s iPhone 12 models is reminiscent of the iPhone 4 design and its stainless-steel rim, which has to be one of the nicest designs of previous generations. The 12 Pro and Pro Max both feature a surgical-grade stainless steel band that is color-coded to match the textured matte glass back.The 6.7-inch OLED display of the Pro Max is noticeably bigger than the 6.1-inch display on the 12 Pro. It’s also a step up from the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which offered a 6.5-inch screen. However, thanks to the reduced bezel, this has only meant a 0.11-inch (2.8mm) increase in length and 0.01-inch (0.4mm) increase in width from last year’s model.This iPhone Pro Max is also tougher than ever. It has four times the drop performance on the iPhone 11, thanks to the new Ceramic Shield front glass and super-tough back glass to avoid a painful shatter that would follow smartphones of old slipping from your hand onto concrete or tile. And it’s not just dropping, reaching for the bag of rice after a spill isn’t required here, as the iPhone 12 Pro Max is IP68 rated, being water-resistant up to six meters for up to 30 mins. So even full submersion in a pool, sink or toilet bowl should no longer be game over.Perhaps the biggest design change is the addition of MagSafe charging to the iPhone 12 Pro. As the name suggests, this uses magnets to align a compatible MagSafe charger to the back of the iPhone, providing 15W of power. This is similar to how the Apple Watch charger functions and avoids the issue of devices not charging when not lined up properly on wireless pads. Regular wireless charging is also still available with Qi wireless devices at the lower 7.5W power.The MagSafe system can also recognize a series of accessories including cases and card wallets that snap to the back of the phone. We tried the leather MagSafe case and the MagSafe leather card wallet, which can hold up to three credit cards securely.At 6.7 inches, this is the largest display to feature on an iPhone. With a resolution of 2778x1284 pixels, it is also the sharpest, giving it a resolution of 458ppi. Photos and video benefit from a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio and a maximum 1,200 nits peak brightness during HDR playback, which is the same as that of the iPhone 11 Pro Max.  Under typical use, expect more like 600 nits, which is great too.The result here is a screen that you can comfortably watch, whether at home on the sofa, commuting to work on a bus or train, or further afield. Watching any kind of footage looks great but shows such as Apple TV’s Earth at Night in Color – which is both in 4K and with Dolby Vision – look truly stunning.The 6.7-inch screen also feels natural to use in landscape mode for a number of applications in a way that the 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t, such as with email (split with preview pane) or even web browsing. This also opens up more complex gaming options, such as city or empire-building sims that would otherwise need a tablet to fully enjoy.The only thing really missing here is a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate. Instead, it is capped at 60Hz, like the iPhone 11 Pro. This might frustrate mobile gamers – particularly as phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 and OnePlus 8T both offer 120Hz displays, and more games are being optimized for higher refresh rate screens.As with video, the iPhone 12 Pro Max supports a range of audio formats, including Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital Plus. There’s also spatial audio playback for a true cinematic sound experience when using AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices.While most content is likely to be enjoyed through headphones, the iPhone 12 Pro Max does offer stereo speakers, mounted in the top and bottom of the phone. This gives a nice wide stereo effect when watching movies in landscape mode and pumps out some impressive volume.While the physical size of the iPhone 12 Pro Max might be its most obvious differentiating factor, the camera system is the most impressive. While the three-camera array is similar to the iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone 12 Pro, the performance has been improved.The standard 12MP wide-angle lens (26mm equivalent) has a wider f/1.6 aperture, compared to f/1.8 on last year’s Pro models. The 12 Pro Max also benefits from a brand-new larger sensor compared to the iPhone 12 Pro. This, combined with the aperture, results in an 87% better low light performance than the 11 Pro Max. And while the 12 Pro features optical image stabilization on the wide-angle lens, the 12 Pro Max uses a new sensor-shift OIS, that moves the sensor rather than the lens.The 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens (13mm equivalent) provides a 120-degree field-of-view, which is 2x wider than the standard lens. This allows you to get much more into your shot, which is handy for landscapes or for dynamic street shots.The third lens is a 12MP telephoto lens. While the telephoto lens on the iPhone 12 Pro remains almost identical to the iPhone 11 Pro models, here on the Max it gets an upgrade. Rather than the 2x zoom f/2.0 (52mm equivalent), it has a longer 2.5x zoom f/2.2 (65mm equivalent). While this is not as long as either of the tele lenses on the Samsung S21 Ultra, the 65mm length is a really nice crop for portraits and will be extremely popular with photographers and videographers. The telephoto lens also benefits from optical stabilization and there’s a 5x digital zoom if you want to go even closer.The Portrait shooting mode has been improved and takes advantage of both the wide and telephoto lenses. Night mode now also functions with the ultra-wide lens and the front TrueDepth camera, and Deep Fusion – Apple’s pixel-by-pixel image analysis – works on all cameras. HDR photo mode has also been upgraded with Smart HDR 3 for more true-to-life images.Photos can be captured in either JPEG or the HEIF formats and for the first time on the 12 Pro models, in Apple ProRAW. This is a DNG format that retains all of the information from the sensor, but also takes advantages of Apple's HDR and Deep Fusion techniques. ProRAW pics can be easily edited in-camera or in an external editor, such as Photoshop, for even greater control over the image.From the same spot using the ultra-wide (left), wide (center) and telephoto (right).You can create dynamic landscapes using the ultra-wide lens.Using the Portrait mode on wide-angle (left) and telephoto (right).Using the front TrueDepth camera with Portrait mode (left) and High Key portrait effect (right).The iPhone 12 Pro Max handles exposure very well, even with high contrast scenes like this.

There’s great edge-to-edge sharpness and spot-on exposure, even in high contrast scenes. When viewed at 200% you can see a slight haloing on areas of contrast and some compression in the HEIF files but these are really minor.The portrait mode does a great job of isolating the face, keeping it sharp and well exposed while blurring the background. The cutouts for the stage light effects still aren’t perfect but the high-key effect is really effective.The addition of the LiDAR scanner provides the iPhone Pro 12 models to deliver accurate augmented reality experiences by creating a depth map. It also helps the camera system to provide up to six times faster autofocus in low light conditions, allowing for night portraits.The front camera remains much the same as in the iPhone 11 Pro: a 12MP with f/2.2 aperture and a retina flash. It does, however, now support smart HDR 3 capture for still images, night mode and deep fusion for image optimization, and HDR video recording with Dolby Vision.Videographers also benefit from the new three lens arrangement, as well as the benefits that come from the stabilization and low light abilities. The biggest change for video is the native support for 10-bit HDR video, which is converted to Dolby Vision for replay or output. This provides an even more professional-looking video at up to 4K 60fps.The much-anticipated introduction of 5G to the iPhone this year is likely to be the feature that prompts many to upgrade. Here in the US, all four iPhone 12 models feature both the sub-6GHz (or regular) 5G as well as the super-fast mmWave 5G. In the UK and Australia, mmWave is not yet available, and so the iPhone models don’t support it.Regular 5G offers speeds of 100 to 400 Mbps, which is still considerably faster than many home wireless connections. In the US, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile all offer the faster mmWave 5G in major US cities, with potential speeds of up to 1.8Gbps.On T-Mobile’s standard 5G in Chicago, I was able to get up to 160Mbps and was able to easily stream 4K video content on the go. However, even on LTE (4G) I was able to achieve a speed of 106Mbps.The iPhone 12 Pro Max is equally fast for general performance, courtesy of its A14 Bionic chip. This features six cores (two performance, two custom efficiency) making it Apple’s fastest CPU to date in a smartphone. It also features a four-core GPU and a 16-core Neutral Engine. All of this results in a seamless user experience; apps open instantly and the gameplay is silky smooth.Even memory intense apps, such as the photo effect Prisma, run considerably faster than on older iPhones. While all this is to be expected from the operating system on a new phone, the real test will be how it handles future releases of Apple’s OS a year or two from now.When the iPhone 12 Pro Max battery does get low, there are a number of choices for recharging. Using Apple’s 20W adapter it will reach 50% charge in around 30 mins and a full charge in around 1.5 hours. Using the MagSafe charger, which offers 15W charging, it takes around three hours for a full charge. Using older 10W or 12W USB chargers, or 7.5W Qi wireless chargers, will take longer.While the iPhone 11 Pro Max offered a significant bump in battery life compared to the iPhone XS Max, the new 12 Pro Max offers identical figures to its former: 20 hours of video playback (12 hours streamed) and up to 80 hours of audio playback. These figures are significantly better than those of the iPhone 12 Pro, beating it on video playback by three hours and audio playback by 15 hours. This is thanks to a larger 3,678mAh battery and means that, even with a decent amount of use, you can easily squeeze a second day out of it.While this isn’t the best battery life we’ve seen on a smartphone, it’s still a decent performance and makes the iPhone 12 Pro Max the number one choice for Apple users seeking extra usage time.The iPhone 12 Pro Max is more than worthy of its flagship status. While this year’s iPhone 12 Pro model is also a top model, the benefits of the larger screen, premium camera system and better battery life make the Pro Max an obvious choice for those that demand the best.While the 5G connectivity, A14 chip and screen size are impressive, for us the true highlights of the 12 Pro Max lie in its camera system. Having the ability to edit in camera and still output in DNG format means you can really do more with your still shots. And for video, the 12 Pro Max offers a compact device capable of professional output.While the move to MagSafe won’t have a huge effect on most iPhone users just yet, it is an interesting innovation that has huge potential for the future of wireless charging. We still miss the MagSafe on the MacBook Pro and while that solved the issue of tripping on a wire, MagSafe on the iPhone offers new solutions for holding the device in place for car charging, add-on accessories and beyond.If you want something a little smaller in the hand – and lighter on the pocket – the iPhone 12 Pro is identical to the 12 Pro Max in many of its features. The camera arrangement still offers the three lenses, albeit with a slightly shorter telephoto, a smaller sensor on the wide angle and just optical rather than sensor-shift stabilization. It’s also a little shorter on battery life but still delivers decent audio and video times. Read our full iPhone 12 Pro review here.For those that are more casual with their camera needs, the iPhone 12 lacks the telephoto lens but offers the same wide and ultra-wide cameras as the 12 Pro. Plus it still has the same A14 chip, ceramic shield glass and water resistance as the pro models. Read more about it in our iPhone 12 review.Users that aren’t tied to the Apple system have a wide range of Android phones to choose from. Our best picks include the OnePlus 8 Pro, which features a 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh, a four-camera array, IP68 weatherproofing and that all important 5G. The other option has to be the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. This has a 6.8-inch screen with 120Hz refresh rate, a pinhole 40MP front camera and a quad-camera rear array, including a 108MP main camera. It also supports the Samsung S Pen stylus.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/iphone-12-pro-max-review
51,Xiaomi Redmi Note 9T,Xiaomi Redmi Note 9T review: one of the best 5G phones on a budget,"With the Xiaomi Redmi Note 9T you've got a handset looking to be one of the best phones around while still coming in at a price that's very reasonable: it continues the tradition of the Xiaomi-made brand, offering something more affordable than the Mi series of handsets.In fact it shoots straight into our list of best cheap phones because of the combination of features, connectivity, build quality and price that you get here. Notably, it has 5G on board, which is very useful if the next-gen network has reached your part of the world.In the Redmi Note 9T review that follows we'll take you through all the key features, specs and details that you need to know about when it comes to this phone – from what you can expect in terms of battery life, to how well the camera picks out details in the dark.The Redmi Note 9T is out now and available to buy direct from Xiaomi, SIM-free and unlocked: prices start at £179 during the flash sale that's running at the time of writing, and after that the regular prices will be £229 for the 64GB storage version and £249 for the 128GB storage version. Expect the phone to arrive at other retailers in due course.The Redmi Note 9T brings with it a fit and a finish that belies the handset's very affordable asking price – it's hardly the lightest or most stylish phone we've ever seen, and it feels slightly cheap and plasticky in the hand, but just by looking at it you couldn't guess that it's as inexpensive as it actually is. We like the textured finish to the back, and the curved edges, and the choice of colours (either Daybreak Purple or Nightfall Black, with the black one the model we reviewed).We also like the 6.53-inch, 1080 x 2340 pixel LCD display – at this price point you can't expect anything like a super-fast refresh rate, and HDR support is also missing, but it's big and sharp and bright enough to keep most people happy. Whether watching movies streamed over the internet or browsing through articles on the web, we found the display of the Redmi Note 9T perfectly fine.There's just a single punch hole notch for the selfie camera interrupting the display on the front, while the rear camera is in the centre on the back: not the most aesthetically pleasing setup we've ever seen, but we can live with it. The phone also sticks its fingerprint sensor inside the power button, a move we don't generally approve of – it makes the power button more difficult to find and press, and the fingerprint sensor less easy to use. It worked well enough in our testing, but we prefer to see it placed on the back (or under the phone display).Xiaomi describes the Redmi Note 9T as having a ""water-repellent coating"", but you're not going to get anything approaching an IP68 rating for waterproofing here (par for the course down at this price point). There is, however, a headphone jack. Overall, we'd say we're largely impressed by what the phone has to offer in the design and screen departments, though you won't be mistaking this for an iPhone 12 or Galaxy S21.The triple-lens 48MP wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth rear camera sported by the Redmi Note 9T isn't much to write home about, but you've got to bear in mind the price you're paying. There's no ultrawide mode, and no optical zoom, but the main 48MP camera does a respectable job of taking good photos in good light – something that most budget phones are able to manage now.The shutter speed could be a little faster, and colours were occasionally off balance, but overall you'll get very satisfactory snaps from this phone – definitely good enough for social media and then some. Unfortunately we had a week's worth of rain during our time with the Redmi Note 9, making it difficult to take some really impressive pictures, but the samples we've included below give you some idea of what the rear camera can do.As always with budget phone cameras, it's in low light where problems start to happen, with plenty of noise creeping in and a lot of details lost. The handset can still get some okay shots in low light – though the night mode doesn't seem to make a whole lot of difference either way – but it's worth bearing in mind that a lot of mid-range phones have excellent cameras. If photos are a priority, you might want to consider spending a bit more on your next phone upgrade.In a two-hour video streaming test, the battery on the Redmi Note 9T fell from 100 percent to 81 percent, which would work out as 8 hours overall. That was with the screen brightness set to the max though, so you could probably extend that. In general use, the phone easily gets into a second day, thanks to that large 5,000 mAh capacity battery – it's definitely one of the better handsets we've seen for battery life, though you have to make do with (18W) wired rather than wireless charging.In terms of internal specs, the Redmi Note 9T brings with it MediaTek Dimensity 800U 5G processor, 4GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage (and there is a memory card slot if you want to expand that). Looking at those specs you know that the phone isn't going to offer mind-blowing performance, but the combination of processor and RAM mean you can get through most tasks without too much trouble.While the experience of using the phone isn't exactly what you'd call nippy, it is perfectly usable, and we didn't have any issues with slowdowns or lag. This will change if you start to load up a few dozen browser tabs, but for the majority of the time everything will run smoothly. We put the Redmi Note 9T up against some of the more demanding games on the Play Store too, and they all ran without a hitch. On Geekbench the phone scores 595 (single-core), 1788 (multi-core), and 1909 (OpenCL), which are by no means the worst results we've ever seen.There is, notably, support for 5G here – making this one of the cheapest phones to offer the next-gen connectivity. If 5G has already rolled out in your area, or it's scheduled to do so soon, then you can take advantage of the improved download and upload speeds with the Redmi Note 9T. If you're going to be stuck with 4G for the foreseeable future – and remember 4G still offers some very decent data rates – then you might consider 5G something you can live without for now.The phone runs Android 10 rather than the latest Android 11, and the usual Xiaomi MIUI skin is here. It's by no means a disaster as far as software goes, but the bright and almost childish colouring, as well as the array of preinstalled apps – WPS Office, Amazon Shopping, Facebook, TikTok, AliExpress, the bundled Mi apps – leave us yearning for the lightweight and bloat-free stock Android edition.If you're shopping down at the budget end of the smartphone market, then you will of course have to temper your expectations about what you're going to get in return for your money: you're not going to come away with something that has the screen, camera and build quality – or the performance – of the best iPhones (for example) if you're only paying a fraction of the price. Low-cost handsets are improving all the time though, and the Redmi Note 9T definitely holds its own at this price point.The inclusion of 5G in a phone so inexpensive is definitely worth noting, while the large screen and the overall design of the Redmi Note 9T are to its credit as well. While the triple-lens rear camera is going to struggle in some situations, especially as it gets darker, it is capable of producing some very good results – and again you have to take into consideration the phone's affordability when weighing up any aspect of it.It's really a question of what you actually need a smartphone to do for you, and the Redmi Note 9T will do just about all of it for a price that undercuts almost everyone else. We've seen some appealing and affordable phones from the likes of Motorola, Nokia and others in recent months, but Xiaomi is definitely in the conversation when it comes to stretching your money as far as it will go on your next phone upgrade.While we feel the lack of ultrawide and optical zoom on the camera, and continue to prefer stock Android to the MIUI software that Xiaomi puts on its phones, we don't really have too many complaints about this phone when you factor in the price. Come the end of the year we reckon that the Redmi Note 9T from Xiaomi is still going to be up there in our list of the best cheap phones you can get your hands on.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-note-9t-review
52,Vivo X51 5G,Vivo X51 5G review: the premium mid-range market gets even more crowded,"The Vivo X51 5G marks the Chinese company's first foray into the UK market, joining the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and Oppo in trying to expand into the west – and as you'll see from our detailed Vivo X51 5G review, this is a smartphone that's likely to attract a lot of fans.Specs-wise, the handset carries a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, which is a notch below the Snapdragon 865 that was Qualcomm's flagship CPU for 2020. However, the chipset still carries plenty of punch (it's the same as the one in the Pixel 5).One of the stand-out features of the Vivo X51 5G is its rear camera: it combines four separate cameras and boasts 5x optical zoom as well as a built-in gimbal for stabilising your shots. If you're after a phone with an impressive camera, this could be the one.The Vivo X51 5G will cost you a significant sum of money, but depending on what you're after, you might be able to justify the investment. It's certainly a confident UK debut for Vivo, and it gives users yet another well-specced mid-range phone to choose from.The Vivo X51 5G is out now and available to buy in the UK. Check the widgets on this page for the latest prices for a SIM-free, unlocked handset, but at the time of writing you're looking at a cost of around £650-£750. You can find the phone on sale from retailers including Box, Clove, eBuyer and Laptops Direct.We really like what Vivo has done with the design of the X51 5G – it looks like a premium-level phone and it feels like a quality device when you're holding it. We're fans of the curved glass that is used on the front of the phone, and the matte finish of the glass that's used on the back, which looks great. Aluminium is used around the sides of the phone, and the grey finish that you can see in the pictures accompanying this review is your only choice in terms of colour.The 6.56-inch OLED screen is a stunner too, running at a refresh rate of 90Hz and a resolution of 1080 x 2376 pixels. It's sharp and bright and smooth, and looks fantastic whether you're watching videos, browsing through photos or flicking through your social media channels. We also appreciate the really nice-looking live wallpapers that Vivo has included, such as cars travelling slowly down a highway.Thanks to that curved glass screen, you barely notice the bezels around the display, and a small punch hole notch in the top left-hand corner is the only interruption. On the back the camera array is in the top left corner too, and although it's a bit blocky, it looks fine. The normal volume and power buttons are on the right-hand side of the Vivo X51 5G as you look at it from the front.You don't get a headphone jack here, just a USB-C port for charging and data transfer. There's a single speaker built into the frame, as well as a fingerprint sensor built into the screen which is speedy and accurate as far as we can tell. The Vivo X51 5G doesn't come with any kind of waterproofing or dustproofing, so you'll have to be careful while you're handling it (and you might want to invest in a case.The Vivo X51 5G comes rocking a quad-lens 48MP wide + 8MP ultrawide + 8MP telephoto + 13MP portrait rear camera, giving you both an ultrawide mode and 5x optical zoom thanks to that periscope telephoto lens – it's an impressive overall package, and we were able to get some very decent results from it. There's even a built-in gimbal for optical image stabilisation, to keep your photos and videos super-sharp. Video tops out at 60 frames per second at a 4K resolution.In use, it's a really good camera – one of the best we've come across at this particular price point. Images are sharp, bright, well balanced and detailed, and captured in an instant too. The ultrawide and zoom modes give you plenty of control as well of course, and if you dive deeper into the settings for the camera app you can take more control over different options such as shutter speed and white balance.That gimbal-enabled stabilisation really helps when it comes to capturing crisp shots and letting as much light as possible through the lenses, and that extends to low light photography as well: we were able to get some really nice shots at night, with minimal blur or noise, and even when the dedicated night mode wasn't enabled. This is a serious player in the high-end smartphone camera market.Battery life isn't quite as impressive, as we usually had around 25 percent or so left at the end of each day, on average – that's good but not spectacular. In our two-hour streaming video test, with the screen at maximum brightness, the battery dropped from 100 percent to 89 percent: that works out at a very respectable 18 hours of video overall before you're going to get right down to zero. 33W fast charging is supported, but no wireless charging.Inside the Vivo X51 5G we've got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which isn't expandable – those are very decent specs for a mid-range-to-flagship phone at the start of 2021, and you'll find the same processor in handsets including the Nokia 8.3, the Pixel 5, the OnePlus Nord and the Oppo Reno 4 5G.Those internal specs means the Vivo X51 5G speeds along no matter how many apps you're running or how many browser tabs you've got open at once. Geekbench 5 scores of 599 (single-core), 1753 (multi-core) and 1292 (OpenCL) show you that if you're going to go just below the flagship level for your next smartphone, the Vivo X51 5G is one of the most powerful options out there.5G is of course on board, as you've probably gathered from the name, so if the next-gen connectivity has rolled out to your area then you can take advantage of it. We're not sure that 5G is an absolute necessity just at the moment, but at this point it's getting harder to find new phones that don't have the technology built in.Chinese phone makers love to play around with Android and Vivo is no different, adding what it's called Funtouch OS on top of Android 10. To be fair it's not too bad, though there are a few mostly redundant apps and shortcuts installed by default. We do like the dedicated game mode, which can minimise distractions and maximise performance while you're playing games on the Vivo X51 5G.Vivo may have only just arrived in the UK but it has of course been churning out top-quality phones for years, and it shows with the X51 5G. Over the last 12 months a lot of phones have been aiming for that sweet spot between performance and price, between flagship and mid-range, but few have hit the mark quite as well as Vivo has – and this is a handset that left us impressed.It's really well designed, with a great, vivid screen and a superior quad-lens rear camera that comes up with very decent results no matter what the lighting conditions. The internal specs aren't quite the best you can get, but they provide more than enough power for most people – and that's why you're now seeing so many phones clustered around this particular price point.While you can buy phones with more power, better cameras and bigger screens, we're not sure many of them are worth the price mark-up when you look at what the Vivo X51 5G has to offer. Very few corners have been cut, although you are going to have to do without the wonders of wireless charging, and the phone doesn't come with an IP rating for full protection against water and dust.All you can ask of any phone is that it justifies its price, and the Vivo X51 5G does that and then some – even up against competition from the likes of Xioami, OnePlus, Google, Apple, Samsung and the rest in this particular segment of the market, this handset has enough to hold its own against its rivals, and win over plenty of fans.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/vivo-x51-5g-review
53,Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite,Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite review: budget 5G phones keep on getting better,"The Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite is the Xiaomi approach to phones pushed to the maximum: every handset the Chinese company makes is built around the idea of relative affordability, but this is one of the cheapest handsets on the market at the moment if you need 5G speeds.We're getting to the stage where 5G is standard on handsets now, even if the network coverage isn't particularly comprehensive, but you can still save yourself some cash by going without 5G for your next phone purchase – 4G remains pretty rapid, after all.Despite the low, low price, the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite brings with it some tempting specifications, including a 120Hz screen and a Snapdragon 750G processor. At the same time there are compromises to talk about, as you would expect from a budget phone.In our Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite review we'll outline everything you need to know about this handset, from the internal specs to the battery life to the camera performance. It should be enough to help you work out if this is the right phone for your next mobile upgrade.The Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite is out now and available to buy in the UK, SIM-free and unlocked, for a recommended retail price of £199 and up (check the widgets on this page for the latest online deals). There will be some variation in the price depending on which configuration of the phone you go for.At the time of writing, Vodafone is the only UK network offering the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite on a contract, but at this sort of price you might be better off buying the phone outright anyway. Retailers selling the phone without a contract include Amazon and Xiaomi itself.The Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite is by no means a bad-looking device, but it's perhaps a bit chunkier and plainer than phones you'll get higher up the price spectrum, in the mid-range market. It does go for a glass back rather than a plastic one, which is unusual at this price point, and gives the phone a slightly more premium feel than it might otherwise have (plastic can still feel pretty premium however, depending on how its used).As for the large 6.67-inch LCD display, running at a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels, it comes across as a notch below the very best screens in the business. Still, it's bright and sharp, even if it doesn't match the vividness and contrast you get with the top OLED panels. It also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, which means that on-screen animations and page scrolling is super smooth.There's a punch hole notch for the camera, and the bezels around the display are reasonably thin. We certainly don't have any major complaints about the aesthetics of the phone – which comes in Atlantic Blue, Rose Gold Beach, and Pearl Grey (like our review unit) – and the Mi 10T Lite design holds up very well when you compare it to other smartphones at this price point. As usual for a budget handset, there's no water or dust resistance rating.The rear camera array is a little on the big and ugly side, and we're not that fond of putting the fingerprint sensor in the power button, as Xiaomi has done here (it just makes it more fiddly to use). You do get a 3.5mm headphone jack down at the bottom of the phone next to the USB-C port, and there are stereo speakers on board.Budget phones tend to pack in multiple cameras that don't do an awful lot, and with that in mind we present the Mi 10T Lite's quad-lens rear camera: a 64MP wide + 8MP ultrawide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth affair. You do get HDR processing, though it can be a bit hit and miss, as well as an ultrawide mode; on the other hand, there's no optical zoom.We found we could get some really good shots with the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite during our travels with it: shots with bright, well-balanced colours, plenty of detail, and sharp edges. You can see in the sample shots that we've embedded below that these photos are fine for social media use, and most of the time you're going to come out with something that's well balanced and crisp.At night the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite can struggle, but the dedicated night mode does help a bit. It's possible to get usable photos in dim lighting conditions, but quality isn't on a par with the phone's mid-range competitors, and plenty of noise can creep in. Despite occasional struggles at night, and a slight shutter lag at times, we were left impressed by the camera performance given the price of the phone.The 4,820mAh battery that comes inside the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite went down from 100 percent to 80 percent during our two-hour video streaming test (with the display at maximum brightness, it should be noted) – which means about 10 hours of streaming in total. The Mi 10T Lite won't let you down in terms of battery life, but it's not going to last much beyond a day, so nightly charges are still required unless you're really going easy on it (the 33W fast charging helps here, though there's no wireless charging).The Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite comes running a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor, which is paired with 6GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage. We'd recommend going for the larger storage option if you can (the price difference is around £30), or at least making use of the microSDXC card slot to add some more room.Performance is fine without being spectacular – about what you would expect from a phone that costs so little. Most tasks are completed without a hint of lag, but more demanding games and apps do start to drag just a touch. The phone scored a satisfactory 659 (single-core), 1999 (multi-core) and 1301 (OpenCL) in our Geekbench 5 tests.Again, though, it's decent for the price. When you come back to the cost of this phone, just about everything that the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite brings with it looks very good indeed. The Snapdragon 750G is a respectable performer at this price point, and the 6GB of RAM means that you won't easily run into problems while running multiple apps or having dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.Don't forget that 5G either, so if you are in a region where the next-gen speeds are supported, you can take advantage of the greater bandwidth and transfer rates. Xiaomi's MIUI take on Android continues to be just a bit too garish and unnecessarily complex for our tastes – your mileage may vary – but it's not a huge problem (Android being Android, you can always install an alternative launcher anyway).The Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite is definitely one of the best budget phones on the market at the moment, and if you've got around £200 to spend then you'll struggle to do better than this – the phone has a large screen, some decent specs, and 5G on board. The question is whether your needs would be better served by spending just a bit more cash.The mid-range section of the market has phones like the iPhone SE, the Pixel 4a, and the OnePlus Nord to pick from, and while they all have their own strengths and weaknesses too, you can find phones better than the Mi 10T Lite for not a whole lot more money. Add in good quality, affordable phones from the likes of Nokia, Motorola and others, and picking the right handset for you isn't all that straightforward.What weaknesses the Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite has aren't dealbreakers: camera performance and battery life are only average, which is actually fine considering how much you're paying (or rather not paying). Plenty of phones have screens and designs that outshine the Mi 10T Lite, but again it holds its own at this particular price point.If you can put up with Xiaomi's MIUI software and value app performance over camera quality, we'd say the Mi 10T Lite is definitely worth a place somewhere near the top of your shortlist if you're shopping at this price point. You get a lot of smartphone for your money, which is just about all you can ask from a device.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-mi-10t-lite
54,Nokia 3.4,Nokia 3.4 review: Nokia's latest ultra-budget phone on test,"The Nokia 3.4 sees Nokia (or rather parent company HMD Global) continuing to churn out satisfactory, budget Android handsets – if you want a phone for as little money as possible, then Nokia is a brand worth turning to, and that's definitely the case with the Nokia 3.4.The key selling point, and just about the only stand-out feature of this phone, is the price: it's about a tenth the cost of some of the top-end flagships from Apple and Samsung, and with that in mind we're prepared to give it a lot of leeway in terms of a few compromises.And you will get compromises – in terms of the screen, the performance, the camera quality and so on. If you're willing to take slightly inferior tech for a much lower price though, then the Nokia 3.4 – and this in-depth review – should be of interest to you.Whether you're wondering about the Nokia 3.4 battery life, or how well the smartphone runs, or the camera quality of the Nokia 3.4, or anything else about the handset, we've got the answers here. This is what we found after several days of using the phone extensively.The Nokia 3.4 is out and available now, for around £130 in the UK and around $180 in the US. You can buy it direct from Nokia as well as from third-party retailers including Argos and Tesco. It's also available on contract at networks including O2.There's also a James Bond tie-in here: the upcoming Bond flick No Time To Die has been extensively referred to in the promotion of the Nokia 3.4, though we're not sure if this is one of the handsets that will be in the film when it appears in 2021 (there will definitely be one or two Nokia models on show at least).Pick up the Nokia 3.4 and it has that slightly cheap, slightly insubstantial feel of a budget phone, but then you wouldn't expect a premium slab of glass and metal at this price. As always with a Nokia phone, it's well put together and comes with an aesthetic that's not unappealing if also a little bit dull. We've seen worse-looking handsets at this price point, let's put it that way.Purple, blue and black (the colour we reviewed) are your colour choices, and we quite like the textured plastic back of the phone, which gives it a decent grip and is something different from the norm. We're not so keen on the circular rear camera arrangement, just above the rear fingerprint scanner, but that's more of a personal preference.As well as the usual volume controls and power switch on the right of the phone as you look at it, there's also a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left, which we actually find useful for calling up the digital assistant app. There's a USB-C port on the bottom, and a 3.5 mm headphone jack on the top. As is the norm for budget phones, you don't get any sort of water or dust protection, so be careful what you do with it.As for the screen, the 6.39-inch LCD panel runs at a resolution of 720 x 1560 pixels, with a single punch hole notch for the selfie camera. It's a respectable display – watching movies and browsing the web is fine – but it's by no means a stand-out. You're certainly going to notice the difference in display quality if you put this up next to something like the OnePlus Nord.Around the back the Nokia 3.4 packs in three cameras: a 13MP wide, a 5MP ultrawide and a 2MP depth camera. There's no optical zoom, but there is some HDR processing, as well as that ultrawide mode for fitting more into the frame. The choice of modes is fairly limited here once you open up the camera app, with Portrait, Photo, Video (1080p up to 30 fps) and Night the choices you've got.The quality of photos you'll get from the Nokia 3.4 is variable, with occasional problems with noise and blurring as you snap away. Shutter speed is a little slow, and some pictures can end up muddy and flat. That said, we were testing the phone on a drab, wet day (which is pretty much unavoidable at this time of year), and if you've got a lot of natural light and a steady hand, you can still get decent shots for social media.The dedicated night mode isn't really much help, as it boosts the brightness but tends to introduce even more noise and fuzziness – photos in the darkness often look better in the standard mode, though you will need some light to see anything. Overall, the camera quality is only okay, which is perhaps what you'd expect at this price.Battery life was fairly average too, with around 30 percent or so of a charge remaining at the end of each evening. The phone doesn't seem to lose much juice in standby – perhaps due to the adaptive battery management in Android – but fares less well in use. In our two-hour video streaming test (at maximum display brightness, which is a bit unfair), the battery dropped from 100 percent to 71 percent, suggesting you'll get about 6-7 hours of streaming in total.The Nokia 3.4 comes with a budget Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chipset, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage – that's really the bare minimum for running a smartphone these days, though you can at least expand the storage by slotting in a memory card (though that adds to the cost of the phone of course). This is really just a phone for doing the basics, like sending messages, browsing the web, and checking social media.Geekbench 5 scores of 249 (single core), 1116 (multi core) and 256 (OpenCL) show that this phone and its specs are a long way behind the mid-range handsets that'll cost you three or four times as much – the savings are significant, but so are the performance levels. Some of the more demanding games we tried struggled to run properly, for example, although watching streaming video is no problem at all.While the phone is by no means unusable, there is a sluggishness here when you're doing many interactions, whether that's opening new browser tabs or flicking through photos. Still, it's almost impossible to find a phone that's cheaper than the Nokia 3.4, so that always needs to be taken into consideration – if this is just a handset for occasional, undemanding tasks then it'll get by okay.We do at least like the software, the uncluttered and bloat-free version of Android that comes with all Nokia handsets (it's Android 10 in this case). As part of the Android One program, the Nokia 4.3 is guaranteed timely software updates for a minimum of two years, and security updates for a minimum of three years (though we suspect you might have upgraded by the time the phone is three years old).The Nokia 3.4 is a fairly straightforward proposition: it gives you a usable smartphone for not very much money at all. If you're looking to get a new Android handset while spending as little as possible, then we'd suggest getting the Nokia 3.4 somewhere on your list – you're not going to find a working handset for very much less than this if you have a look around at what's available at retailers.Nokia being Nokia, this is a well put together handset that feels like it's going to last from a hardware perspective - it actually looks better than you might expect from a phone at this price point. While the display isn't particularly brilliant, you can certainly get by on it, and we were able to do everything from watching streaming video to browsing across the web without noticing any problems with the display.On the downside, in terms of performance, battery life and camera quality, you're really getting close to the bottom of what's acceptable from a smartphone. The Nokia 3.4 does okay in these three areas, but no more than that, and the improvement is very clear in phones that occupy the £300-400 range. If you can afford to stretch to that higher price point, then we think it's worth doing.Overall, the Nokia 3.4 is going to be able to do everything you need a smartphone to do, apart from run demanding apps and games – it's just not going to do anything to a very high standard. If that's a compromise you're willing to make to get a phone at this low, low price, then this is a handset that you'll want to investigate further.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/nokia-3-4-review
55,iPhone X,iPhone X review: the best you can get and a worthy Black Friday purchase,"The most important phone since the original iPhone? Well perhaps. It's clearly a radical new design that – Apple says – paves the way for another decade of smartphones. So this review is driven by one central question in mind. Can we really cope with a phone that pretty much relies on no physical controls when in use?Regular T3.com readers will know that we don’t normally talk much about price. It’s the same here, but it’s hard to deny that iPhone X is expensive, even when compared to the last phone we gave five stars to – the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. We’ve seen some amazing phones this year so we’ll also be asking if the iPhone X is the best of them.The iPhone X is the first of a new generation of iPhones according to Apple. That's clear just by looking at it – there's no home button – the iPhone's principal control mechanism for the last decade.Central to this is Face ID. Apple’s Touch ID tech works so well, especially for payments, and before looking at the iPhone X (pronounced ‘ten’) we were very sceptical as to whether Face ID was a worthy replacement for touch. You’ll see what we made of it below.The first thing that’s quite surprising when you take it out of the box is just how small it is. The last two phones this writer has used are the Note 8 and latterly the iPhone 8 Plus, both superb handsets – but big. Of course, it’s not the iPhone X display that’s small, but the body of the phone is. It feels a lot more like the iPhone 8 than the 8 Plus.The materials used undeniably make the phone feel super-premium, even if the glass back is a bit of a fingerprint magnet. The new glass-backed design means that you can set the iPhone X down on a wireless charging pad and it'll instantly start sucking up juice. It's the universal 'Qi' standard as well, so you won't need a special Apple wireless charger for this to work. Apple has the power to make technologies mainstream because of its ability to convince partners that 'now is the time' to adopt. Integrating the Qi wireless standard at this stage is a phenomenal boost to wireless charging, even if others have been doing it for ages.You can charge the handset up in around two hours normally, but connecting a USB-C to Lightning cable to a USB-C MacBook charger will give you fast charging, up to 50 percent in about half an hour. You can almost watch the battery percentage tick over as you charge (frustratingly you can no longer see the battery percentage in the status bar, you need to pull down Control Center).We love the stainless steel edge especially. The so-called ‘notch’ at the top of the screen is far from intrusive and houses plenty of stuff. However, there is a bit of an issue with some apps not rendering themselves correctly around the notch, while some apps – Safari notably, just use bars to make the screen a more conventional shape. Expect these quirks to get ironed out.The notch in the screen is not overly intrusive but some apps don't render around it correctlyThe second thing that’s surprising is the first time you swipe up to go to the Home screen in iOS 11. It should feel weird, but we found it didn’t. Other reviewers said it took them days to get used to the lack of home button, but we really weren’t troubled by it. Yes, really. We surprised ourselves and have only tried to press a non-existent home button a few times.Indeed, we found ourselves significantly more perturbed by other control changes – swiping down from the top right to get to the Control Center is fine, but your thumb doesn’t quite stretch that far, so you need two hands or you need to jockey the handset slightly into position. Apple’s ‘Plus’ size Reachability feature to enable you to pull down stuff at the top of the screen (that, to be honest, we always invoked by mistake) is no longer on by default here, but it is there if you want it.The side button – formerly for on/off and sleep/wake – is overused for features now there is no home button. As well as putting your phone to sleep, it’s now co-opted for Siri (long press) and Apple Pay (two short presses). This works OK, but not brilliantly. We found ourselves putting the phone to sleep rather than getting to Siri. Not good, though of course you can invoke Siri with your voice.If like us you switch your phone off at night (we value our sleep) then you’ll now need to press and hold one of the volume buttons plus the side button. A quick press on the volume up and side button takes a screenshot (don’t use volume down and the side button as that will sleep your phone). So that’s one volume button for one function and either for another – it’s way too complex.One thing that isn’t complex is Face ID. You set it up during the initial iPhone configuration and then, er, that’s it. 15 minutes after we started to use the phone we realised we’d locked it several times (as we took photographs and generally played around with the side button controls) but we had just swiped up to open the phone each time.It suddenly dawns on your that your face has indeed unlocked the phone. It’s a strange moment. We hadn’t had to make any effort to unlock it. And that’s what Face ID is supposed to be like.It isn’t the barrier that you imagine it could be, though we did find it a little weird to have to make sure our face was available when using Apple Pay! Now, Samsung’s facial recognition (to unlock the Note 8 and S8) is close to Face ID. We were impressed at the ease at which it unlocks the Note 8 recently. But it doesn’t do anything else. Because Face ID is so baked into iOS it means that you rarely need your passcode. And it’s not just about unlocking your phone with the iPhone X, it’s about Apple Pay, App Store payments and more.OS: iOS 11
Chipset: Apple A11 Bionic
RAM: 3GB
Storage: 64GB / 256GB
IP Rating: IP67 waterproof
Display: 5.8-inch AMOLED 1125 x 2436 pixels (458 PPI)

Dimensions: 143.6 x 70.9 x 7.7 mm
Weight: 174 gThe 2,436 x 1,125, 5.8-inch OLED screen seems markedly brighter when placed alongside the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus although it’s apparently is rated for the same brightness as the 8 Plus – 625cd/m2.The iPhone X does seem a lot smaller when compared to the 6.3-inch display on the Note 8, though. It's certainly true that the edge-to-edge screen looks stunning, both from a design perspective and from a technology viewpoint. But it isn’t groundbreaking thanks to the other edge-to-edge designs we’ve seen this year.The display also packs HDR and Dolby Vision support, which is very welcome, as it Apple's True Tone technology that we've previously seen on the iPad Pro series. This monitors the ambient light around the handset, and calibrates the screen to perfect it under your current lighting conditions.The iPhone X excels on the performance front thanks to Apple's new A11 'Bionic' processor. This is the same chip used in the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. In our Geekbench 4 test the iPhone X lags behind the ‘8’ handsets on outright single and multi-core performance, but the difference is negligible in terms of the numbers. 4191 vs 4214 from the 8 Plus.The X is slightly behind in the ‘Metal’ graphics benchmark, but again the difference is negligible.An interesting footnote is that these iPhones are the first to include a mobile graphics processor that has been designed completely by Apple – the company recently stopped using Imagination’s PowerVR graphics, primarily so Apple can control its own designs, tailored to its needs, especially when it comes to graphically intensive applications such as AR Kit, where we’re seeing some truly innovative apps.We’ve found that the iPhone X battery life is broadly comparable with the iPhone 8 Plus – Apple itself reckons the A11 Bionic-toting handsets will give you two more hours of battery life versus the year-old iPhone 7.The 2716mAh two-part battery may be larger than inside Apple’s other premium phone, but the larger screen does for the extra capacity. In real-world (as constant as possible) testing, including watching streams from YouTube and BBC iPlayer and listening to high quality streamed music from Tidal and Apple Music over cellular, we found we were skipping through around 10 percent of battery per hour. Apple cites around 12 or 13 hours of internet use or video playback, so we only found it was slightly worse than that.The first 10 percent does seem to disappear shockingly quickly though. In reality, for everyday use you will get through the working day and deep into the evening without needing to charge – you’re talking around 16-18 hours.With lighter use, you’ll probably have about 20 percent left at the end of a complete day. That’s comparable with the iPhone 8 Plus which uses the same A11 Bionic processor. But if you compare like-for-like with the iPhone 8 Plus and watch, say, an HD video for an hour, you’ll notice the iPhone X dropping a bit less, thanks to the OLED display.You can use 3D touch to launch the camera from the lock screen or swipe in from the right as before.The front-facing TrueDepth camera is a 7MP model and now features portrait mode. Google’s Pixel 2 boasts excellent portraiture capabilities with a single lens, but here it’s the depth perception of the TrueDepth cam that ensures selfies look superb. And as with the iPhone 8 Plus, you can also add other portrait lighting effects. As with the 8 Plus, some of these modes work better than others – stage lighting in particular is rather patchy. And also new in iOS 11 is the ability to loop, bounce or long-expose live photos.The rear camera on the iPhone X is very similar to the one on the iPhone 8 Plus, with some very small differences, notably Optical Image Stablisation (OIS) on the telephoto lens (like in the Galaxy Note 8)There’s a dual 12MP sensor array which produces some truly sensational shots. For taking zoomed-in pictures, or capturing depth perception in a scene) the iPhone X has an f/2.4 aperture, where on iPhone 8 Plus it’s f/2.8. There are some clever technology at play here. For example, when zoomed in during low light conditions, the wide-angle lens (instead of the zoom lens) is utilised to produce a better image.  There is still a lot of noise in low light conditions.With good light, however, it’s hard to fault the photos from the iPhone X, and we’ll bring you a gallery of the best images we’ve taken very soon.As on the iPhone 8 Plus, the iPhone X can record 4K at 60 frames per second and the results are superb. But, if you’re going to regularly record such high quality on your device, you’ll need a lot of storage space for it.Is the iPhone X the best phone this year? Yes. But only by a whisker. The Galaxy Note 8 is so close, while Apple’s own iPhone 8 Plus gives you so much of the iPhone X benefit without such super expense. In the end though, it’s the marriage of software and hardware that’s so effective here and that’s especially the case when it comes to Face ID.It’s what Apple is so good at. It’s why the iPhone X is 2017’s best phone, just ahead of Samsung’s devices and – sorry Google – streets ahead of the Pixel 2 (although it has a pretty decent camera). We’ll see what Samsung comes back with when we get our hands on the Galaxy S9 in the new year. Can’t wait.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/iphone-x-review
56,Huawei P30 Pro,"Huawei P30 Pro review: unprecedented camera, familiar design","Dimensions: 158 x 73.4 x 8.4 mmWeight: 192 gScreen: 6.47-inch, 19.5:9, 398 ppi (1,080 x 2,340)CPU: Kirin 980RAM: 6GB/8GBStorage: 128GB/256GB/512GBBattery: 4,200 mAhCameras: 40MP + 20MP + 8MP rear + ToF / 32MP  frontOS: Android 9.0 Pie, EMUI 9.1Welcome to T3's official Huawei P30 Pro review, your comprehensive guide to every aspect of the hot new handset from the Chinese maker, ranging from the Huawei P30 Pro specs and Huawei P30 Pro price, through to our detailed breakdown of the phone's hardware and features. We've also got information on the best Huawei P30 Pro deals right now, including information on Huawei P30 Pro eBay prices.And, simply put, Huawei's latest flagship really is a phone to sit up and take notice of. Not only is the device loaded with the flagship Kirin 980 chipset that debuted in the stunning Mate 20 Pro late last year, which as benchmarks prove is lightning fast, but the P30 Pro also comes with buckets of memory and storage, a smaller notch, a significantly bigger battery, and a redesigned camera system.And it's that new camera system that really helps the P30 Pro stand out from the crowd. Building on the 3x lossless optical zoom introduced with the P20 Pro last year, Huawei has outdone itself with the P30 Pro. If you're looking for a truly unique smartphone camera experience – or hoping to start an amateur detective agency and need a seriously powerful zoom in your pocket – this might just have to be your next phone.However, as this Huawei P30 Pro review will hopefully make clear, this handset is far more than just a picture-taking powerhouse, and has the potential to be the perfect phone for a variety of different users.The Huawei P30 Pro is available right now from a variety of online and high-street retailers, including: Carphone Warehouse, EE, Vodafone, Mobiles.co.uk, Virgin Mobile, and of course directly from Huawei.The Huawei P30 Pro price currently sits at £899 SIM free for the 128GB storage variant, and £1,099 for the 512GB version.Huawei P30 Pro eBay prices currently sit as low as £744.99 for a brand new sealed device.With the P30 Pro, Huawei has taken the ideas that it introduced with the P20 Pro last year and run with them. The impressive 3x lossless optical zoom that helped the P20 Pro snatch a five-star review from us last year has been increased to 5x optical zoom. Not only that, but there's also a 10x lossless hybrid zoom feature that uses the AI built-into the Kirin 980 chipset to sharpen up your shots and remove any blur from hand movements. It's seriously impressive stuff.Of course, since Huawei has simply increased the amount of zoom that you get out of the latest P series, you could be forgiven for thinking this is an unimaginative, or iterative update to the formula from last year.But that would be selling the Huawei P30 Pro very short.Huawei hasn't stopped with improving the zoom capabilities. Instead, Huawei has rebuilt its entire camera system from the ground-up – a complete overhaul that starts with the sensor in the new quadruple-camera system. Rather than opting for an off-the-shelf RGB (Red-Green-Blue) sensor, like literally every other smartphone manufacturer on the planet, Huawei has decided to use a RYYB (Red-Yellow-Yellow-Blue) sensor in the P30 Pro. That's because Yellow sensors can absorb twice as much light as their Green counterparts, which means they can gather a lot more information with every press of the shutter button.All of this extra information is processed and crunched by Huawei's onboard AI to improve zoom and low-light images. However, as you might expect, ditching the RGB configuration seen everywhere else in the smartphone industry requires a pretty fundamental rethink on how to process information gathered by a camera. Huawei says they've been working on this change for years, but have only just managed to bring the solution to market. It also says that it's one of the only companies that could engineer this type of change, since it builds the silicon and ISPs for its phones.Moving to the RYYB sensor also required Huawei to rework how its Kirin 980 Image Signal Processor handles the input from the camera. The company clearly believes all this upheaval will result in more detailed images, better hybrid zoom, and improved low-light performance. And over our full review testing time with the handset it soon became clear that these changes have indeed led to an improved, super versatile camera system.Photographs are very sharp and burst with vibrant colours. Thankfully, the images aren't quite as ziggy and over-saturated as the Samsung Galaxy S10 produces. As you'd expect from a modern flagship smartphone, there's the ability to add bokeh-style blur behind the subject of your photograph. While this isn't quite as refined and realistic as the iPhone XS, it stands toe-to-toe with the best from the Google Pixel 3XL and Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. There's also an ultra-wide lens that can create some thrillingly original shots (it can also be useful when sightseeing to squeeze an entire skyscraper into your family shot).Finally, there's the zoom functionality. This is easily the star of the show.The P30 Pro maxes-out at a staggering 50x digital zoom, which lets you get shots that simply wouldn't be possible with any other smartphone on sale right nowThe lossless 5x optical zoom is phenomenal for capturing details in the distance which would otherwise be unseen. In our brief time with the P30 Pro, we were able to zoom into architectural features on the opposite side of the street with crystal-clear quality. This feature will transform your gig photography – whether you agree with people filming concerts is a debate for another time – and a whole host of other everyday shots. And that's not even the most impressive zoom feature.Huawei's hybrid 10x zoom, which it also claims is completely lossless, uses AI to detect what is in the photo and enhance and sharpen any details that may have been lost in the digital zoom. It's seriously impressive stuff. Text works particularly well. For example, we were able to zoom into a small road sign using the 10x hybrid zoom at the other end of a busy London street – only to find the resulting image almost as sharp as if we were stood beside it when we pressed the shutter. Granted, not everything comes out as crystal-clear as pain text. Whatever algorithms are running behind-the-scenes in the hybrid zoom system made some of the people around the sign in our shot look a little over-sharpened and janky.To achieve all of this impressive zoomage, Huawei is using a quadruple-camera system that combines a 40-megapixel f/1.6 wide-angle camera with Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS), a 20-megapixel ultra-wide sensor, an 8-megapixel telephoto sensor, and a Time Of Flight (ToF) lens with a flood illuminator. The latter is used to dramatically improve the bokeh-style blur behind the subject of a portrait-style photograph. With future software updates, Huawei says the ToF will also be able to measure objects and people from within the viewfinder, similar to the Measure app built-into the latest versions of Apple's iOS.Huawei is employing both Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) and AI-powered digital stabilisation to remove any trace of a wobble from your stills and videos – something that is extremely important when you're trying to line-up a shot in 10x zoom on a busy street, trust us.This system also helps to minimise blur from shots taken with the dedicated Night Mode, which keeps the shutter open for longer to draw-out as much possible light from the scene.Speaking of night photography, the low-light capabilities of the new P30 Pro are very impressive, with the handset delivering 409,600 levels of ISO sensitivity compared to only the 102,400 that were offered on the P20 Pro. This makes taking images even in really low-light environments, such as a library in near complete darkness, a remarkably easy, relatively blur-free experience.An example of the P30 Pro's Night Mode. This image was taken in a dark library where, to the naked eye, it was hard to make out individual book titles.Unlike many other rival devices at the P30 Pro's price tier, who's low-light modes offer an improvement to clarity and sharpness but retain a nighttime aesthetic, the P30 Pro dramatically shifts the image's overall illumination. Pictures taken in dark rooms suddenly look like they were taken in the evening instead, for example.The image above, for example, which was taken in a dark library, looks in the image like it was taken with the room's lights on. Equally, when viewing these books with the naked eye it was incredibly difficult to make out their titles, however here in the Night Mode image that is not the case.Will Night Mode lead you to take better or more creative images? No, probably not. We can't imagine you hanging a Night Mode shot on your wall, or winning a photography competition with a snap, as in the grand scheme of things the image quality isn't brilliant. But if you absolutely have to shoot something in darkness or very low light then it allows you to do that.On the front of the P30, Huawei has slimmed down the small notch at the top of the display – very much like what OnePlus did when it moved from the OnePlus 6 to the 6T last year. This has enabled Huawei to increase the size of the screen from the 6.1-inch panel seen on the P20 Pro to a larger 6.47-inch FHD+ resolution OLED with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The display looks solid – it's colourful and vibrant. That FHD+ resolution means this is far from the sharpest display on the market right now, but at normal viewing distances – namely, at the end of your arm – it's absolutely fine.[CPU test]Single-core: 3,267Multi-core: 9,659[Compute test]RenderSript Score: 5,890[Battery test]Battery Score Estimate: 6,650For our money, it's not as brilliant as the AMOLED panels on the Galaxy S10 range, which are genuinely jaw-dropping. That said, the display on the Huawei P30 Pro is much nicer than anything on the Google Pixel 3 range, which still has an unfriendly cold-look about it, and none of the pop of this panel.Despite the smaller size of the notch, Huawei has managed to squeeze an impressive 32-megapixel front-facing camera into the cut-out. The new selfie camera supports its Super HDR technology, which helps preserve more details in the shadows and highlights – even when there is a harsh light source directly behind you.When it comes to logging into the phone and authenticating secure apps and transactions, Huawei has opted for an in-display fingerprint scanner. Unfortunately, this isn't the fancy ultrasonic variety you'll find on the Galaxy S10 which works through rain and sweat, this is an optical sensor, like the ones used in the OnePlus 6T and Mate 20 Pro. Huawei says it's more accurate and speedier than the latter, which seems to hold-up in our testing, but it's a shame the flagship P series isn't using the same cutting-edge tech as its Android rivals.As for the design of the phone itself, there's no doubt that is a premium handset. The days of the tacky, hollow-feel to the aluminium on the likes of the Huawei P9 and P10 are long gone. The curved glass and metal chassis of the P30 Pro feels solid in the handset. That said, Huawei still lacks some of the refinement that you get with other manufacturers. The P30 Pro can't quite muster the same refinement as the Galaxy S10 Plus, for example. And it's a long way from the fit-and-finish you get with Apple products. It's not an issue per se, but when Huawei is competing directly with these handsets on price, it's definitely worth pointing out.Finally, Huawei has also kept the stunning, shimmering ""gradient"" colour finishes it introduced with the P20 series last year – adding a slew of different options.In total, the P30 Pro is available in five finishes, known as Breathing Crystal, Amber Sunrise, Pearl White, Black, and Aurora. The new colourful cases on the P30 are absolutely stunning and really help it stand out from the sea of indistinguishable aluminium Android devices.The Huawei P30 next to the Huawei P30 Pro.As you'd expect, the latest flagship smartphone from Huawei is running its latest operating system. Dubbed EMUI 9.1, the software is based on Android 9.0 Pie. It runs extremely well on the hardware and offers all the usual features you'd expect from a flagship smartphone in 2019, including the ability to copy something on your phone and paste it immediately using the standard ""Ctrl + V"" keyboard shortcut on your Huawei MateBook laptop, which is pretty nifty.However, EMUI still isn't an attractive operating system by any stretch of the imagination. The cartoon-ish design (and not in a charming way, either) looks outdated and infantile. When compared to the Android experience offered on the likes of the Google Pixel, OnePlus, or the new OneUI software powering the latest-generation of Samsung Galaxy handsets, EMUI looks astonishingly subpar.P30 Pro also boasts fast-wired and fast-wireless charging, as well as the reverse wireless charging that debuted with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro last year. The latter lets you charge other Qi-compatible devices, like the Samsung Galaxy Buds or second-generation Apple AirPods, on the rear case of the smartphone.Thankfully there's a hefty 4,200mAh battery cell underneath the bonnet. This is the same battery that featured in the Huawei Mate 20 Pro last year, which was incredibly impressive on test, and as you would expect it offers the same excellent performance in the P30 Pro. This is both backed up by its GeekBench 4 battery score of 6,650 and also our real-world experiential testing, which saw the battery easily carry us through two days of moderate use without us getting energy anxious.According to Huawei, the advances in AI and battery management brought about by the Kirin 980 and the latest Android OS mean the P30 Pro technically delivers even better battery performance than the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (as can been by the improved battery benchmark score, 6,650 compared to 5,225), but really the two devices felt similar in terms of real-world battery drain.The P30 Pro is a very impressive piece of kit. It has a gorgeous dual-curved design on the front and back that makes the mammoth 6.47-inch OLED display almost manageable in one-hand. And while it doesn't match the Galaxy S10 or iPhone XS in terms of fit-and-finish, there's no doubt this is a well-made smartphone.There's also improved battery life, IP68 water and dust resistance, reverse wireless charging, a faster and more accurate in-display fingerprint scanner, the flagship Kirin 980 chipset, more case colours than before, and more ... let's be honest, the P30 Pro is really all about the camera. And what a camera it is!The quadruple-camera throws down the gauntlet to other smartphone manufacturers. Yes, there's the usual bokeh-boasting portrait modes and ultra-wide angles seen on rival handsets, but the improved optical and hybrid zoom are the real stars here. In a nutshell, the Huawei P30 Pro lets you capture photos that you simply wouldn't be able to get with any other phone.So, there you have it - the Huawei P30 Pro is without doubt an excellent, marked upgrade over the Huawei P20 Pro, and a strong rival to Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus. If you are an Android phone user and are currently in the market for a powerful upgrade then you certainly won't be disappointed with the P30 Pro, even though there are rival devices that offer a similar experience.If you looking for a new flagship Android phone and are also a photography enthusiast, though, then the P30 Pro gets elevated straight to the top of your shopping list, with its best-in-class camera system guaranteed to absolutely blow you away.29 March 2019: As well as being available to pre-order in the UK (here are the best Huawei P30 Pro UK deals), the P30 Pro is now up for pre-order in Canada. Customers who pre-order the P30 Pro will get a free Huawei Watch GT. The pre-order time period is from 11AM EST March 26th, 2019 to midnight EST Wednesday April 10th, 2019, although Huawei notes that the pre-order time period may vary by retailer, and that the watches are only available ""while supplies last"".Pre-orders have also gone live in Australia, with handsets being delivered from 16 April. The Huawei P30 Pro in its 256GB configuration is priced at $1,599, while you'll also get a bonus Sonos One smart speaker valued at $299 with any P30 Pro pre-order, which is a pretty sweet deal.1 April 2019: Huawei is rolling out its first software update for the P30 Pro as an OTA (over the air) update.  The Huawei P30 Pro update brings EMUI up to version 9.1.0.124 with build number C431E4R2P2. It's just over 400MB in size.The update upgrades the 'Always on Display' feature to enable notifications from third-party apps when the screen is off. The update also ""optimises camera performance certain scenarios"", fixes an audio issue that affects playback of Instagram videos, and improves fingerprint unlock performance. Additionally, the update includes March 2019 Google security patches. It's great that Huawei is pushing out updates event before widespread availability of the handset even if it does mean that one of the first things you'll be doing when you set up your P30 Pro is installing the update.11 April 2019: The Huawei P30 Pro has been made a YouTube Signature Device. This means that the handset is, according to Google, one of the very best phones on the market for watching content on YouTube. YouTube Signature Devices, specifically, must meet a series of criteria such as the ability to deliver HDR, 360° video, 4K and high-frame rate content playback.16 April 2019: US phone enthusiasts who have been thinking about picking up a Huawei P30 Pro but, due to the Chinese maker's current troubles in North America, have been struggling to find a respectable retailer who can fulfil their order, should take a look at B&H. That's because the retailer is offering the entire P30 range of phones for shipping in the USA at some really attractive prices. You can currently pre-order the Huawei P30 for $599, the Huawei P30 Pro for $899, and the Huawei P30 Lite for $319.23 April 2019: Teardown maestros iFixit have taken apart a Huawei P30 Pro and discovered some interesting design choices. Firstly, as seemingly ever now with phones, getting in the device was incredibly tricky, with the site noting that the Pro had one of the tightest gaps it had ever witnessed. Secondly, it was more pleased to discover that the P30 Pro, once its screen was prised off, could then be dissembled with a single Philips screwdriver. Next up was the interesting discovery that the Chinese maker had saved space by layering the device's two PCBs on top of each other. And, finally, Huawei seem to be currently leaning toward modular components, with the USB-C port, optical fingerprint sensor and battery all singular and removable. Unfortunately, this modular-ness is not enough to secure the Huawei P30 Pro a good repairability score, with iFixit finally bestowing a 4 out of 10 score.29 April 2019: The much talked about Huawei P30 Pro periscope camera has been shown off in a revealing teardown video. The camera takes up almost a third of the P30 Pro's motherboard and is constructed from three segments, with the sensor facing to the side rather than up or out. Throw in a stack of lens and an angled mirror an this camera is shown to be quite the feat of engineering.30 April 2019: The Huawei P30 Pro camera is getting a big upgrade as part of an update to the EMUI 9.0 version of Android that the phone runs. The update brings the new Dual-View video recording feature to the phone, allowing users to capture footage from two perspectives at the same time. The feature was originally announced at the launch of the handset but it's only just become available. The EMUI 9.1.0.153 update also adds 'Charming' portrait mode to the camera, apparently enabling users to apply ""more appealing blurring effects."" Additionally, the update introduces the Huawei Vlog app, which automatically generates highlight reels and applies filters. And finally, it includes Google's April 2019 security patches.10 May 2019: The EMUI 9.1.0.153 update is now rolling out in the the UK and other markets. As well as the features mentioned above, the update also brings a new app called AR Measure. The app uses the P30 Pro's camera to measure objects that you point the phone at – a sofa or box, for example. The phone's face recognition technology also also enables users to measure someone's height by scanning from toe to head. Another piece of good news if you're thinking of buying a P30 Pro: Huawei has promised that its P30 series of phones will get the Android Q update ""immediately after Google officially releases the stable version for its Pixel phones"". That means that the P30 Pro could be running Android Q as early as July 2019.20 May 2019: Huawei has been dealt a harsh blow that means its handsets, including the P30 Pro, will not be updated to Android Q. That's because the US government has banned American firms from doing business with Huawei and as a result Google has suspended business with Huawei immediately. Google says that services like Google Play and security from Google Play Protect will keep functioning on existing Huawei devices but it seems unlikely that the phone will receive any new versions of Android. For Huawei's part it says ""Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold and that are still in stock globally.""20 June 2019: Huawei now says that it WILL be bringing Android Q to the Huawei P30 Pro, as well as selected other Huawei handsets. In a statement, it wrote: ""Our most popular current devices, including the P30 series, will be able to access Android Q. In fact, we have already launched a beta developer programme for Android Q which is running right now on our Mate 20 Pro device.""1 July 2019: It now looks almost certain that the Huawei P30 Pro, as well as other phones made by Huawei, will be able to use Google Android again. That's because US president Donald Trump has said that ""US companies can sell their equipment to Huawei"" once more. What that means is that the P30 Pro will continue to have access to the Google Play Store, Google apps such as YouTube, Maps and Gmail, and the new operating system update that is Android Q.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/huawei-p30-pro-review
57,Huawei P30,Huawei P30 review: an excellent phone and a great all-rounder,"Dimensions: 149.1 x 71.4 x 7.6 mmWeight: 165 gScreen: 6.1-inch, 19.5:9, 422 ppi (1,080 x 2,340)CPU: Kirin 980RAM: 6GB/8GBStorage: 128GB/256GB/512GBBattery: 3,650 mAhCameras: 40MP + 16MP + 8MP rear / 32MP  frontOS: Android 9.0 Pie, EMUI 9.1Our Huawei P30 review is here to tell you exactly how well (or otherwise) Huawei's 2019 flagship phone hits its targets – it's smaller than the Huawei P30 Pro, and doesn't have as good a camera, but it's a solid step up from the Huawei P20.Is it something you should be spending your money on? Google's recent announcement that it won't be supporting Android on future Huawei phones is worrying, but if you pick up the P30 you know you'll have full access to the Google Play Store at least. What you won't get is any future Android updates – at least not until Huawei and Google (and the US and China) sort out their differences.Black Friday  dealsThe Huawei P30 is smaller, thinner and less expensive than the Huawei P30 Pro, but the phones are very similar in many other areas – from the teardrop display notch to the super-fast Kirin 980 processor under the hood. The main benefit of picking up the P30 Pro is that extra rear camera lenses, which means a massive 5x optical zoom that you don't get on the standard P30.If you can live with a very good rather than a great camera though, we think the Huawei P30 is a very appealing proposition. It's fast, it's well built, and it ticks a lot of the boxes you need from a flagship in 2019 (trade wars notwithstanding).The Huawei P30 is out now and available to buy in Aurora, Amber Sunrise, Breathing Crystal, Black or Pearl White (the same colour choices as the P30 Pro). In this review we're looking at the Aurora model, that blue-to-turquoise gradient shade that we think looks rather appealing.You can pick the phone up from a wide range of retailers and networks: Giffgaff has it for £649 SIM-free up-front, or £30.98 for 24 months with a £25 up-front payment. Over at Carphone Warehouse the P30 is yours for £699 SIM-free up-front, or £34 for 24 months with a £29.99 up-front fee.Most retailers, including Mobiles.co.uk and Amazon, will sell you the phone for around £700 without a SIM. Typically, paying everything up-front for the handset, you should be able to get the P30 for about three-quarters the price of the P30 Pro – a substantial saving.Does the phone justify that substantial saving? The rear camera is the biggest difference between the Huawei P30 and Huawei P30 Pro, because you get an extra lens and 5x optical zoom thrown in – in the case of the P30, you only get 3x optical zoom, so the P30 Pro can get you almost twice as close to the action without losing any image quality.Huawei has always been passionate about the cameras on its phones, and this is once again in evidence with the Huawei P30. The camera systems on the P30 and P30 Pro have been rebuilt from the ground up, ditching the traditional RGB (Red Green Blue) sensors for RYYB (Red Yellow Yellow Blue): that apparently lets in more light.Switching to a completely different sensor setup from the rest of the industry is no small task, but add in Huawei's on-board AI processing, and we're pleased to report that the Huawei P30 takes some excellent photos. The 40MP f/1.8 wide-angle, 16MP f/2.2 ultra-wide, and 8MP f/2.4 telephoto camera lenses combine to create some fantastic results, no matter what the conditions.Low light performance is very, very good – perhaps not quite up to Google Pixel Night Sight standards, but close enough. There is one caveat: if you want to take advantage of the built-in night mode here, you need to keep the phone still for several seconds. You can take decent night time shots without it, but you get better shots with it enabled.The vast majority of photos we were able to take with the Huawei P30 were sharp and accurate, with minimal noise and plenty of detail. Colours are well reproduced, dark and light areas are well balanced, and images get captured in a snap – it really is an impressive camera setup and one of the best we've tried.The Huawei P30 Pro will certainly get you closer to the action and produce slightly better snaps – especially in low light – but there's not a huge amount to choose between the P30 and P30 Pro in the camera department, even with that extra lens (which is mainly to add extra zoom capabilities after all).If you don't mind a bit of a loss in quality, you can actually zoom in up to 30x with the Huawei P30, though we wouldn't really recommend it – you also need to dial down the photo size from 40MP to 10MP to take advantage of this. Unless you absolutely have to see something close up, stick to the 3x or below.The camera can record video at up to 4K at 30 frames-per-second too, as well as offering up a fun slow-motion video feature to play around with. The usual plethora of Huawei shooting modes are included too, from monochrome to light painting, which can help you capture snaps that stand out.In our testing there was never a scenario that the Huawei P30 did terribly at, and in most cases the images it captured were very good, even excellent at times. Thanks to the combination of optics and software, you can genuinely just point-and-shoot in a variety of scenarios to get some winning shots.That extra lens on the Huawei P30 Pro is missed of course, but perhaps not by as much as you would think. You still get a 3x optical zoom on this model, which can help everywhere from gigs to wildlife watching.Huawei has done a fine job with the design of the P30, building on last year's P20 to bring us a phone that's even more refined and stylish. That small teardrop notch really helps, as does the bright, rich 6.1-inch screen. The 1,080 x 2,340 is sharp and vivid, and actually offers up more pixels-per-inch than the Huawei P30 Pro.Whether you're watching streaming video or flicking through your Instagram feed, the screen shows off any kind of content really well: it's definitely one of the highlights of the P30 package, and you've got HDR10 support here too. We found it a snug fit in our hands, and 6 inches or a little bit above seems to be a sweet spot at the moment.When you're watching video in landscape mode, the notch is automatically blocked off so it doesn't impinge on your video viewing. You can also disable the notch in the phone's software settings if you like too, so you get a solid black bar across the top of the phone interface rather than a cut-out.With minimal bezels, an eye-catching screen, a choice of appealing colours, and a fingerprint sensor that disappears under the screen, it's a definite two thumbs up for the design and display of the Huawei P30. In fact, with the smaller size, it's one of the areas we actually prefer it to the Huawei P30 Pro.It might not look quite as stylish as something like the Samsung Galaxy S10 or the iPhone XS, but it definitely comes close, especially with those excellent colour choices. Nice touches such as the colour accent on the power button, and the positioning of the camera flash, add to the aesthetic appeal as well.The Kirin 980 and 6GB or 8GB of RAM mean lightning fast performance too, and you'll struggle to get a faster phone this year. It's definitely not going to be slacking in the performance stakes, and in everything we managed to put the P30 through – from the latest Asphalt racing game to AR filter effects – it passed with flying colours.[CPU test]Single-core: 3,267Multi-core: 9,659[Compute test]RenderSript Score: 5,890[Battery test]Battery Score Estimate: 6,650The Huawei P30 runs Huawei's own EMUI 9.1 software on top of Android 9.0 Pie, and it's a bit of a mixed bag. There's nothing specifically wrong with the software, but it's not as clean and intuitive as some other Android variations we've seen, like those from Samsung and OnePlus for example.From the rather chunky and old-fashioned looking cartoony graphics, to the plethora of Huawei apps and services loaded on to the phone, the OS is perhaps one of the main downsides of the Huawei P30. This being Android though, it's not too difficult to tweak and customise to suit your own tastes.Fast charging is included, and a 3,650mAh battery that in our one-hour-of-Netflix test dropped from 100 percent to just 95 percent – by some distance the best result we've ever seen in that test. That was backed up in daily usage, with a healthy 30-40 percent of battery life often left in the evenings after a day of normal smartphone tasks.The Kirin 980 has some serious battery optimisation technology built into it, Huawei says, and based on our usage and testing we can well believe it. It's a refreshing change to find a phone that's so big and powerful and yet which doesn't suck up battery life at a worryingly fast speed.Huawei has cut some corners on the P30 though. There's no wireless charging and no IP68 full waterproofing and dustproofing, which gives you two reasons to go for the Huawei P30 Pro instead. What we do get is a return of the headphone jack after it was dropped from the Huawei P20 phones, something that will please anyone with an expensive pair of wired headphones they want to keep on using.The in-screen fingerprint scanner is an optical rather than an ultrasonic one, which means speedy performance – something we can attest to – but less reliability in the wet. We didn't come across any problems during our time with the phone though, and definitely prefer this to having a fingerprint scanner on the back.Of course the Huawei P30 Pro is a better phone than the Huawei P30, but it's also a more expensive phone, and in terms of internal power and specs the handsets match up almost identically. Factor all of that in, and we think there are going to be a lot of people who find this the preferable option.Okay you don't get that extra lens and the extra zoom it provides, but you do still get a very good camera. Add in an excellent screen, superb battery life, and plenty of power under the hood, and you've got a phone that matches up well with the best handsets of 2019.As we said at the start though, with no Android or Google support in the future, the Huawei P30 is a much less attractive proposition than it otherwise would be. You might want to check on the latest state of play between the US and China before pulling the trigger on this purchase.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/huawei-p30
58,Samsung Galaxy S9,Samsung Galaxy S9 review: a refined Android phone with excellent camera,"OS: Android 8.0 (Oreo)Processor: Octa-core processor (2.8 GHz Quad + 1.7 GHz Quad)Display: 5.8-inch Quad HD + Curved Super AMOLED, 18.5:9 (570ppi)RAM: 4GBRear camera: Super Speed Dual Pixel 12MP AF sensor with OIS (F1.5/F2.4)Front camera: 8MP AF (F1.7)Dimensions: 147.7mm x 68.7mm x 8.5mmWeight: 163gStorage (internal): 64GBStorage (external): MicroSD up to 400GBBattery: 3,000mAhThe Samsung Galaxy S9 is, in terms of hardware and design, an iterative update of last year's Galaxy S8. The S9 features the exact same screen as last year's phone, the same amount of RAM and storage, the same capacity battery, and an almost identical design, too. And, the same is true for the S9 Plus (check out our Samsung S9 Plus review for details), too.The Samsung Galaxy S9 is getting some astonishing discounts in the Cyber Monday sales, too, so if you are considering picking up the phone then this review is a great place to start your research.Indeed, only the Samsung S9 range's 12MP dual-aperture rear camera system is legitimately leap-ahead new, which explains at least in part why Samsung has been so keen to push its ""The Camera Reimagined"" slogan in the marketing run up to the phones' release date.However, Samsung's new camera system is, in many ways, the gateway to the S9's real new advancements and innovations, including a new upgraded version of Bixby (Samsung's AI assistant) with real-time object detection and recognition, AR Emoji (Samsung's version of Apple's Animoji), and Super slow-mo 960fps video recording.Of course, Samsung's new flagship Android phone also comes with a pretty darn hefty price tag and, with the S8 now considerably cheaper on the market, it is only natural to wonder whether these more holistic, every-day-use features on top of similar hardware is worth the expense.To discover whether this is a crippling blow or not to Samsung's 2018 Galaxy S8 read on.The Samsung Galaxy S9 is available in three colours: Lilac Purple (the colour we tested here), Midnight Black and Coral Blue.The Samsung Galaxy S9 costs £739 to buy. The phone can be purchased directly from Samsung as well as select retailers.On contract the Samsung Galaxy S9 can be picked up with 16GB of data and unlimited minutes and texts for £59 per month (£29 upfront cost) over at Vodafone.Check out our Samsung Galaxy S9 deals page for the best S9 prices!The Galaxy S9 has retained a headphone jack.Take a quick glance at the Samsung Galaxy S9 and you'd be hard pushed to differentiate it from last year's S8. It isn't identical, though.The phone is slightly wider and heavier than the S8, and the top and bottom bezels have also been shrunk a little more, producing a slightly shorter device in the hand.Also, there is a new colour to choose from as well, Lilac Purple, which is the scheme we've been using during our testing period. This is an attractive new colour in our eyes, successfully exuding an exotic and premium aesthetic.Other changes to the Samsung S9 are equally small-scale. For example, the phone's Iris scanner hole has been hidden in the top bezel, producing a cleaner overall look, while the Samsung Galaxy S9's fingerprint scanner has been shifted to beneath the phone's dual-aperture rear camera.From our extensive testing of the Galaxy S9 we can confirm that this new central positioning of the fingerprint sensor is a small but marked improvement. Reaching around the phone with your finger is simply easier and more natural, and you also make less finger-on-camera mistakes as with the S8.The S9's 5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED screen is superb.Yes, we said it once, and we'll say it again: the Samsung Galaxy S9 has the exact same display as the Samsung Galaxy S8. It's the same 5.8-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED screen with 18.5:9 aspect ratio, and it is the same Infinity Display, too, meaning that 90 per cent of the phone's front is pure panel. Those now standard but still gorgeous curved edges are also still in residence.And, guess what? It is still an absolute stunner. Yes, Samsung hasn't given the Galaxy S9 a new screen, but when the S8's was so good and way, way beyond the competition (even now), what does that matter? The Samsung Galaxy S9's screen is just fantastic and it makes viewing photos, playing games and watching films an absolute pleasure.Playing games like Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition is a slick and immersive experience on the Samsung Galaxy S9.What Samsung has done that is new is tweaked the screen's landscape mode, meaning that the whole user interface now rotates to fit the widescreen format, meaning that you can easily respond to messages and post to social media while still enjoying your media.Considering how much time you spend with your phone in a landscape orientation, such as when watching videos on YouTube, playing mobile games, or taking pictures and videos, this is definitely a small but every-day-useful new addition to the S9's repertoire.In terms of internal hardware spec, the Samsung Galaxy S9 comes equipped with 4GB of RAM (the S9+ has 6GB), 64GB of internal storage space and its new Exynos 9810 processor (well, everywhere except the US market, who are getting Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 CPU).This hardware package delivers a very fast and responsive user experience on the S9, with menu navigation incredibly smooth and app loading rapid. Playing demanding smartphone games like Tekken, Hearthstone and Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition is a no-compromise joy on the S9 thanks to that CPU and RAM combo, while the 64GB of internal storage, while rather standard now, does deliver plenty of room for music, movies, games and images.And, naturally, with the S9 supporting microSD cards up to 400GB in size, if you do demand more space then upgrading the phone's storage capability is cheap and easy. For example, a cursory glance at a few popular online stores shows that you can bolt in, say, a 128GB of additional storage space for around £20.The Samsung Galaxy S9 features a 12MP rear camera with dual-aperture technology.This is the big takeaway from the S9. The new 12MP rear camera features Samsung's dual-aperture technology, something that allows for far better low-light photography. The system works by ditching a fixed aperture (common in smartphones) for one that can expand and contract like the iris of a human eye. This means that the S9's camera automatically lets in more light to its sensor when the surrounding environment is too dark, and then less light when it is too light.The rear camera's super slow-motion video capture has also been improved, with the Samsung Galaxy S9 now capable of recording at 960fps at 720p, and 240fps at 1080p (see below video for an example). Neatly, these slow-mo modes now come packing Motion Detection technology, meaning that all the user has to do is hold the phone up to the thing they want to record in slow-motion, with the camera then automatically beginning to record when it sees any motion in the capture field.We've been very impressed with the quality of slow-motion footage captured on our Samsung S9 review unit, which can be easily turned into a video, gif or even live wallpaper for the phone. We're also impressed with the accuracy and speed of the automatic motion detection, which takes away a lot of the pain of timing things correctly.It is important to note, though, that for the super slow-mo modes you do need to keep your S9 very still in order for the automatic motion detection to activate. Naturally, the stiller the phone the better the recorded video quality too. We got best results when using super slow-mo by having the phone placed on a solid, flat surface, or resting our shooting arm on a wall or support.In terms of general shooting with the Samsung Galaxy S9 (some sample images can be seen below) we were impressed with the S9's photo-taking capabilities. The phone's lower or flat-light capabilities in particular stood out (both in on the front and back cameras), as too its raw speed in terms of snapping. The quantity of shooting modes also remains incredibly impressive and the S9's portrait mode, which allows you to take selfies with a blurred background (thereby focusing the shot even more on your beautiful mug), very effective.We're not sure the S9's shooting system is exactly the ""camera reimagined"" from a pure photo-taking point of view, but it is a system without equal in many conditions and applications. Auto mode returned surprisingly good results, even though when shooting into light sources we did still get degrees of wash out, while Manual mode offers chance to tweak a myriad of settings if you have the knowledge and skill to do so. And, with the ability to switch between an aperture of f/1.5 and f/2.4, you now have more options than ever to craft great shots.While the Samsung Galaxy S9's 12MP rear dual-aperture camera and front-mounted 8MP camera aren't exactly ""the camera reimagined"" in terms of pure image taking, they are also absolutely crucial in terms of bringing users the S9's other innovative new features this year, AR Emoji and Bixby Vision, which arguably do show how Samsung has reimagined how smartphone cameras will be used moving forward.Creating AR Emoji is fast and easy, with the function built into the S9's camera menu.Apple was onto something with Animoji on iPhone X it would seem, as Samsung has brought its own version to the Samsung Galaxy S9 – AR Emoji.AR Emoji is a feature built into the system's camera application that allows a user to take a selfie of their face and then have it turned into a virtual avatar of them, one that the user can then dress and style as they choose.The system works by analysing the 2D image with a data-based learning algorithm, which maps out over 100 facial features to generate a 3D model that can reflect facial expressions and emotions.Say hello to one of T3.com's AR Emoji avatars.You can then pose the AR Emoji by holding the camera up to you (as if you were taking a selfie) and the AR Emoji will mirror your expression and pose. At this point you can then take a picture of your AR Emoji, or record a video with sound of you speaking, with your avatar mimicking your actions. These videos are then saved as gifs for ease of sharing on your social or messaging application of choice.You can also select from 18 different stock expressions if you just want to fire back a stock response to a message. Neatly, these are embedded into the Samsung keyboard, meaning you can bring them up and add them just as easily as regular emoji.Multiple different AR Emoji can be created and stored on the Samsung Galaxy S9, too, with the whole process – providing you don't dilly-dally too long selecting the perfect hat – taking about 20-30 seconds or so.Bixby is very fast at translating foreign languages and does so live.Like one of Bertie Wooster's chums from the Drones Club, Bixby is back again in the Samsung Galaxy S9, and this time he's extra tanked up.That means Bixby now has a live translation mode that allows you to simply point the phone's camera at a piece of foreign text (see above image as an example) and Bixby will automatically translate what it says to you on screen.From our testing of Bixby Vision we can confirm that, on the whole, it works well, with the S9 automatically translating foreign texts in a variety of fonts and sizes quickly and accurately.It seems slightly faster than Google Translate, too, however it is important to remember that Bixby Vision isn't hardware based, meaning that you do need a data connection for it to work, and the faster your connection the faster Bixby will get a shift on.Bixby Vision can identify almost anything you point it at, including places, objects, food and wine, before supplying you with more information.Elsewhere, Samsung has also built out Bixby's AR capabilities, meaning that it can supply even more information about foods, monuments, locations and more, and Bixby is also location-aware.These various specialities are selected in Bixby Vision simply by sliding between modes, as you would when selecting a camera mode, and then pointing the S9's rear camera at the thing you want information on.And, yes, for those of you who want to scan barcodes on every item you come across, you will be pleased to hear that Bixby Vision caters to your needs.Users can select from a series of pre-set AR Emoji gifs or create their own.The Samsung Galaxy S9 comes with the same 3,000mAh battery as was included in the S8 and, we've got to admit, this is the one area where we are disappointed with the lack of hardware movement. The S8's battery was by no means poor but, as in all smartphones at the moment, battery life is the one aspect that we really feel has stagnated recently.From our testing period we can confirm that the S9's battery is more than good enough to get you through a day on medium-to-heavy usage. However, we wouldn't expect anything more from the phone and the so-far elusive 48-hour or more battery we a crying out for remains in hiding - this is a day's usage battery for all but the most lightweight users.And that is disappointing, really, as the S9 is so powerful and its screen is so lush that you just want to use it all the time, especially to take and consume media, which naturally are the most battery-sapping activities.Wireless charging is in residence again in the S9 and, to its credit, Samsung remains one of the only makers to make phones compatible with both the Qi and PMA standards. This means that the Galaxy S9 will charge on any wireless charging pad you can buy.In terms of charging, the S9 also features fast-charge capabilities, meaning you can get almost 40 per cent charge into the phone in just 30 minutes, too.Bixby is capable of taking selfies, sending messages to friends, and opening apps, among many other things.Audio on the Samsung Galaxy S9 is dealt with by a set of new stereo speakers tuned by AKG. These speakers come loaded with Dolby Atmos 360 degree audio capabilities, too. Dolby Atmos obviously is designed to improve compatible media, however, on the S9 it will also amplify and enhance definition on any media file.From our ears-on time with the S9 we can confirm it doesn't struggle in terms of volume, and definition is enhanced on standard MP3 tracks when Dolby Atmos mode is activated. The 360 degree audio also works with a compatible source and does add to the immersion, however, it is obviously nowhere near as precise and defined as a proper wired Atmos setup.As with last year's S8 smartphone range, both the S9 and S9 Plus support Ultra High Quality Audio Playback, too, so audiophiles can rest easy.In terms of device security the S9 definitely has you covered, with it offering face recognition, iris scanning, and fingerprint scanning capabilities. The first two of these security measures can be use separately or combined into the S9's Intelligent Scan feature, which allows you to unlock your phone by simply looking at the screen.We've used Intelligent Scan for a while now and 95 per cent of the time it works perfectly, with a red scanning light momentarily flashing as our face and irises are scanned, and then the S9 immediately unlocking.Intelligent Scan can only be activated though if you have setup a back up pin or pattern security measure though, and you can also dictate that upon device power on you require the backup security measure to unlock the phone.Finally, the Samsung Galaxy S9 comes loaded with Android 8.0 Oreo, which runs incredibly fast on the device, with buttery smooth system and menu navigation, as well as zero crashes during our testing period.Samsung has always produced awesome flagship Android phones from a pure hardware point of view. Just look at last year's Galaxy S8, which not only blew all other Android phones released at the time out of the water but, in many cases, is only now been caught up with (we're looking at you, HTC U11+) by competitors in terms of performance.What it has, arguably, always never quite managed is syncing that powerhouse hardware with a holistically fluid, approachable, and interconnected user experience – something that Apple, despite lagging behind in terms of hardware, is a master of.Samsung has been like a DJ operating a top-level set of decks connected to the best sound system money can buy, but one forgetting that it is the journey that the music takes people on which is the most important part of the overall experience.What is evident here, though, from our developing impressions of the Galaxy S9, is that Samsung appears to be starting to remix its focus, no doubt thanks to a maturing of vision and renewed confidence in the post-Note 8 world, and it has seemingly done so in a quietly subtle and effective way.By focusing on how phone communication has moved from the ear to the eye, evidenced by the S9's superb new camera system and gimmick-transcending, system interwoven AR Emoji, Samsung appears to have produced a flagship smartphone that is confident to iteratively tweak its core hardware and then walk away to focus on other, more real-person relevant aspects and features.Samsung now appears truly confident in its own skin and, by knowing when to walk away from the specification war, at a point where it is already the clear victor, it seems to have granted itself valuable breathing room to deliver a very relevant and on-trend user experience.Many thanks to Vodafone for supplying T3 with a Samsung Galaxy S9 review unit.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review
59,Samsung Galaxy Note 9,"Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review: a premium, powerful, and hard hitting Android flagship","Welcome to T3's full, starred, Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review. This is the culmination of my weeks-long reviewing process that has seen me analyse every part of the flagship handset, all in order to see if it is the best Android phone in the world, as well as if it does enough to enter our prestigious best smartphone buying guide.This full Samsung Note 9 review, therefore, covers every aspect of the handset, and is broken down into the core scoring sections of design and build quality, hardware and screen, camera and S Pen, battery and audio, as well as Bixby AI assistant, features and OS.For shoppers looking to weigh up the phone in light of a brilliant discount in the 2019 Black Friday deals sale, this is without doubt a great way to start discovering if the Note 9 is the perfect phone for you, as it leaves no stone un-turned in analysing this phone's hardware and features.So, to find out if the Note 9 is better than Samsung's other 2018 flagship phones, the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus, as well as if it can fend off fierce challenges from rival devices like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, read on.First up, though, I'll cover the Samsung Galaxy Note 9's price, models, and availability.The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 price is £899 ($1,000) for the entry level model, and £1,099 ($1,250) for the top spec model.The two models are specced identically aside from the included RAM and internal storage space, with the base model packing 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage space, and the top spec model coming with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage space.The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is available in three colourways, Midnight Black, Ocean Blue (the model reviewed), and Lavendar Purple.The new Galaxy Note 9 is available to buy from a variety of retailers, including Samsung's official online store, John Lewis, Amazon, Currys PC World, Carphone Warehouse, and Selfridges.Samsung is currently running a promotion where you can trade in certain phones to get a discount on ordering the Note 9. Example price deductions range from -£400 for a Galaxy Note 8 64GB, -£350 for a iPhone 7 128GB, and -£100 for a Pixel 2 128GB. Many more phones are included, too, from a range of makers.The Samsung Galaxy Note 9's microSD slot supports cards up to 512GB in size.Open the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 box and the first thing you notice when lifting the phone out of its internal cradle is just how dense the device feels in the hand.Despite its slimline design, with its total dimensions measuring in at 161.9 x 76.4 x 8.8 mm, the Note 9 in no way feels light, plasticky or hollow, which a few other flagships have done in 2018 with displeasing results.Look at the spec sheet, though, and that premium feel is backed up by a substantial 201-gram weight, which even outweighs technical build-quality leaders like the HTC U12 Plus, which itself felt very premium in the hand.The extra weight could very well come courtesy of the device's enlarged 4,000 mAh battery, which is far larger in capacity than its predecessor's, which was just 3,300 mAh.Rival makers' best efforts at a premium look and feel are blown away by the new Galaxy Note 9This combination of thinness and density means the Note 9 just exudes quality in terms of feel, while its dripping-with-luxe 6.4-inch Infinity Display (more on that tomorrow) completes the package – rival makers' best efforts at a premium look and feel are blown away by the new Galaxy Note 9.Yes, the Note 9 does look and feel similar to the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, and if you put the phones side-by-side screen up then they are nearly identical to look at.However, when you get close-up, and especially when you clock the re-positioned fingerprint reader on the backplate, which is now positioned below the camera lenses rather than to their right, the small improvements Samsung has made on this new Note become more evident.In terms of physical layout of the buttons and stylus port, which now houses the new and improved version of Samsung's S Pen, it is business as usual. Same, too, with the device's headphone jack (yes, Samsung continues to buck the trend on the wireless only audio push) and SIM card / microSD card slot, which remains on the top left of the phone.In terms of frame, the Note 9 features a brushed metal exterior frame that merges near-seamlessly with the phone's Gorilla Glass screen and backplate. This feels smooth and cool under the skin, and is only interrupted by the Note 9's various ports and cooling / audio vents.Lastly, an additional point to note about the Note 9's build quality is that the device is also IP68 water and dust resistant, which for a device that costs nearly £900 in its base configuration are qualities that are definitely most welcome. In no way should this device like this ever come into contact with water, or large piles of dust, but it feels good to know that  the phone has this official certification in its locker.The Note 9 packs a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen. It is the best phone display in the worldDespite all those stories about rival parts makers snapping at Samsung's heels in the construction of AMOLED displays, the 6.4-inch Super AMOLED installed on the Note 9 reminds you, if anything, that those competitors are still streets behind the South Korean maker.The 18:5:9 Infinity Display on the Note 9 is, simply put, a stone-cold stunner and the best smartphone screen in the world right now.Its super size, despite the hate spewed by large phone naysayers, is a thing of iPhone-beating beauty, with its rich and vibrant colour reproduction, strong brightness, high-resolution (1,440 x 2,960, 516 ppi) picture sharpness, HDR support, and lush curved glass absolutely destroying the competition.The Note 9's screen's fidelity, vibrancy, and real-estate are simply unparalleled.I thought the screen on last year's Note 8 was very strong, and the unit installed on the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus equally stunning, but the slightly taller panel fixed into the Note 9 is – marginally – the best of the lot. Its fidelity, vibrancy, and real-estate are simply unparalleled.From streaming HDR movies from Netflix, to enjoying a couple of rounds of intense hand-to-hand combat in Dragon Ball Legends, to reading the fine, fine content on T3.com, and onto taking notes and taking some time out to pen some epic illustrations with the Note 9's S Pen digital stylus, this phone's screen makes it an absolute pleasure.The Note 9's screen is fractionally taller than that installed on the Note 8, and packs an 18:5:9 aspect ratioIn terms of hardware, the Note 9 is right up there in terms of 2018's flagship Android phones, and definitely at the same level of Samsung's own Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus flagships, which both vacuumed up 5 stars from T3.com when we reviewed it.The new entry-level spec Galaxy Note comes packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 128GB of storage space (a 512GB version costs more), 6GB of RAM (this is increased to 8GB on the 512GB storage model), and a 4,000 mAh battery.Running the phone through GeekBench 4, as you would expect, it returned very healthy scores, notching 3,750 in a single-core test, and 9,016 in multi-core. These are scores that, OnePlus 6 aside, are top of the Android tree. And, maybe with the extra 2GB of RAM installed on the higher-spec Note 9, the absolute king.The Note 9 cements the series' reputation as a technical leader in the smartphone field.In terms of RAM, CPU, and storage this compares either identically or very, very similarly to many of this year's best flagship phones, including the Sony Xperia XZ2, OnePlus 6, HTC U12 Plus, and LG G7 ThinQ, while arguably beating last year's iPhone X quite comfortably on paper.Last year's Galaxy Note 8 was a similar technical powerhouse, as you would expect from a phone that has a heritage of technical excellence (maybe aside from the Galaxy Note 7 and its battery issues), and while you could argue that the Note 9 doesn't deliver a spec that reaches boldly into the future, it does deliver an excellent all-round package.As you would expect from such a flagship-grade internal hardware suite, using the Note 9 is a rapid, fluid experience: I experienced zero slow-down or lag while opening and using apps, playing games, switching usage modes (such as when using the S Pen), downloading content and browsing the internet.To be honest that level of performance should absolutely to be expected at £899, though.Overall, then, the Note 9 is a technical juggernaut in terms of screen and internal hardware, with the device cementing the series' reputation as a technical leader in the smartphone field.The Note 9 packs a dual 12MP rear camera setup, with the dual-aperture technology that debuted in the S9 Plus.If you want to have a good idea of how the Note 9's camera system performs you should look to the Galaxy S9, which it has inherited its dual-aperture rear camera features from.The Note 9 features a brace of 12MP rear camera lenses and a single 8MP front camera lens.The dual-aperture rear setup allows the Note 9 to switch between an f/1.5 aperture for low-light photography, and then a f/2.4 aperture for regular lighting conditions, granting the phone excellent adaptability when shooting, especially when conditions get overcast or dark, or when the light is flat.The secondary rear camera on the back of the Note 9 also comes packing a 2x optical zoom, allowing for some pretty decent zoomed in, telephoto-style shots. Both rear cameras come packing optical image stabilisation, too, which I find most useful when pulling out the phone to take quick snapshots.Moving round to the front of the Note 9, the 8MP front camera now comes loaded with a first for the Note series, a front-facing camera with autofocus, which if anything helps to exploit the other major new innovation this year, the Bluetooth-packing S Pen digital stylus (more on that soon).In terms of shooting modes it is business as usual for Samsung, with a dump truck-load of shooting options available, including Auto, Pro, Panorama, Live Focus, Super Slow Motion (960 fps at 720p) and AR Emoji/Selfie. There's also a new scene-optimiser built-in, too, which can automatically adjust images in terms of colours, sharpness, and contrast.Auto mode lets you just point and shoot, while Pro mode allows detailed and complex shooting options to be selected.AR Emoji, which was such a big play on the Samsung Galaxy S9 series, is back on the Note 9 but now with a few extra avatar customisation options.As you can see from the image below, creating your AR Emoji with the Note 9's camera system is super easy, with you simply plonking your face in a capture circle, then sitting back for 5 seconds while the system builds your virtual you.As with the S9, though, the results from my reviewing experience remain sketchy and a little too generic that what I would ideally want. For some reason the system kept making me look like David Duchovny, which while not a bad thing, did seem to highlight the limitations of the system. I also got a few colleagues here at T3 to create avatars, too, and they were equally sketchy as well.At least the process is fast, though, and when you've created your avatar they are then added to your emoji list in the Note 9's menu system meaning you can easily call upon them and insert them into messages.AR Emoji mode remains easy and fun to use. However, its accuracy is questionably similar to on the Galaxy S9.Lastly, while the Note 9 offers many video recording options in terms of resolution and frame rate, with the phone topping out at 4K, 60fps, it doesn't support HDR recording like, say, the Sony Xperia XZ2. It's super slow-motion recording capability, too, remains impressive, with footage capturable at 960fps at a 720p resolution, that is also beaten by the XZ2's 960fps at 1080p recording capabilities.Overall, though, I think it fair to say the Note 9 is a picture-taking, video-recording powerhouse, offering a plethora of shooting options and modes that will appeal to phone and camera enthusiasts in equal measure.The new Bluetooth-packing S Pen digital stylus takes the Note's functionality to a new, higher level.One of the unique weapons that the Note series has had in its armoury for years is its inclusion of a stylus. And in the Note 9, Samsung has taken the stylus to a higher new level, that markedly separates it even from last year's Galaxy Note 8.This time round the stylus has in-built Bluetooth, which allows for some pretty darn neat shortcuts, including the ability to open the camera app and take pictures remotely (great for selfies and wide-selfies; see below image) from up to 30 feet away.The first picture I took remotely with the Note 9's new Bluetooth-packing S Pen digital stylus.You can flip the camera remotely, too, and also start and stop recording video.You can also use the S Pen to start and stop audio tracks, with me easily able to pause the Guardian Football Weekly podcast remotely, and also browse through photos and PowerPoint slides.All these actions are enacted by short, long or double presses of the S Pen's button.The S Pen does need to be charged, which is done when housed internally in the phone. However, only 40 seconds of charge time will bank you around 30 minutes of standby battery, so I can't envisage its tiny internal battery ever running out of juice.Extract the S Pen and you can quickly write on the screen. Or you can create hand-written notes and illustrations by creating a note from the S Pen's menu wheel.I also found its accuracy when taking notes or making illustrations to be very good, and it felt natural to use in my hand, and the stylus' ability to take notes, annotate screengrabs and photos, translate foreign text (you select the words with the S Pen on the screen), and send Live Messages, were genuinely useful.I also liked the fact that the phone's yellow S Pen (I've been reviewing the Blue Ocean colourway, which comes the yellow stylus), which defaulted on the black screen with yellow ink and stood out well.Overall, then, the S Pen is far from a simple gimmick on the Note 9 and with this year's addition of a Bluetooth connection has added some neat new functionality that, believe it or not, you'll likely find yourself using on a daily or at least weekly basis.The Galaxy Note 9 retains a 3.5mm headphone jack for physical wired connections.The battery installed in last year's Samsung Galaxy Note 8 was, as we noted in our review, a ""relatively small 3,300mAh"" unit, which was even smaller than the battery installed on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus, too.This led to a less than stellar performance return on the powerful, 6.3-inch screen equipped Note 8, which demanded power that its internal battery could really only deliver by the skin of its teeth.This was almost certainly down to the fiasco the South Korean maker had landed itself in the year before with the Note 7.So what about the Note 9? Well, the good news is that the new Galaxy Note comes packing a far more potent 4,000mAh battery, which not only feels more suitable for a super-powerful flagship phone with massive 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen, but also far more competitive with its rival devices, too.The Huawei P20 Pro, for example, packs a 4,000mAh battery, and with rumours of the incoming Huawei Mate 20 Pro swinging an even larger battery than that, the Note 9 needed to compete in the same ball park.[Partial discharge, 60 minutes, screen dimmed]Battery Score: 5,672Confidence: MediumNote 8 comparison score: 3,892And, as you can see from the nearby boxout, when I ran the Note 9 through the GeekBench 4 battery test, the phone went ahead a lodged a larger score than last year's entry, raking up 5,672 points in comparison to the Note 8's 3,892.I was definitely heartened to see the Note 9 posting a much stronger score, as while it doesn't approach the battery life king, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 (a monstrous score of 6,059), it is now firmly eating at the top table, so to speak.That said, it is important to note that GeekBench 4 returned an overall confidence score of ""Medium"" in terms of battery performance, though, and from my personal real-world, day-to-day usage, my gut tells me that is correct.I feel the Note 9 delivers a battery that can indeed go the ""all-day"" experience that is being officially touted by Samsung, and with medium mixed usage, too. But my time with the Note 9 has led me to the conclusion that unless you use the device very lightly, you'll rarely be able to comfortably extend that over into day two.The Note 9's Dolby Atmos mode, as well as customisable equaliser and profiles, are easily accessed and make a big difference.This isn't a massive issue, just as it isn't with the vast majority of smartphones, which like it or not, are still very much locked in a daily recharge cycle, be it in the evening or overnight.However, for a phone that prides itself on going big in everything, and being a productivity powerhouse, too, ideally I would want to see an even larger battery slotted in the Note 9.You do get both Fast Charging and Fast Wireless Charging capabilities in the Note 9, though, so at least refilling the phone's tank is a rapid experience.Moving on to audio credentials, the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 comes packing a set of AKG tuned stereo speakers (these are loud and offer a little more depth of sound compared to the Note 8), Dolby Atmos audio support, an in-built equalizer along with selectable UHQ upscaler and reverb-arific Concert Hall toggle, as well as the Adapt Sound system found in the S9.Flicking the switch improves definition and richness across the soundscapeThe Adapt Sound system, for those unfamiliar with the software, allows you to select audio profiles based on your age, or create a custom personalised profile by undertaking a hearing test (requires you to put on headphones).We've seen plenty of other handsets recently enabled with Dolby Atmos audio, including the Razer Phone, Nokia 6, iPhone X, and Huawei P20 Pro, among others, and as on them flicking the switch improves definition and richness across the soundscape, even if the file isn't encoded for Atmos.Naturally, for the full virtual surround sound effects that Atmos can deliver, with 360-degree audio capabilities, you do have to feed it compatible media.Messing around with the phone's equaliser also pays dividends when switching between, say, listening to vocal-heavy podcasts and electronic music albums, and if you have a portable DAC (check out the best DAC 2018), you can get your audiophile on with hi-res or upscaled sound, too.Overall, then, I feel the Galaxy Note 9 does enough in the battery department without really pushing the boundaries of battery life, and delivers the same high-quality, audiophile-ready sound playback as found on the S9 and a few other flagship Android phones.Samsung's AI assistant is more feature-packed than before. However, it still lags way behind Google Assistant and Apple's Siri.Bixby's back baby! And aside from still sounding like one of Bertie Wooster's chums, it returns to the Note 9 with its own dedicated, physical button still in-tact.The Note 9's Bixby button is located on the left hand side of the phone under the volume rocker, with a single press opening the AI assistant's home screen, where you can enter text commands, configure settings, and run through its tutorials, and a long press taking you directly to voice command input.Providing you enable the option, Bixby can also be raised with a ""Hi, Bixby"" voice command, which worked for me like 8-9 out of 10 times while on test. As before, Bixby only recognises certain accents and dialects of US English, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese, though, so you are still bang out of luck if you want to converse in another language.Samsung says Bixby is smarter and better than ever, and it does feature enhanced functionality than before, such as greater learning capabilities that allow it to tailor its responses and suggestions for you better (such as which eateries to recommend based on your past preferences).However, I found Samsung's AI assistant as patchy as ever when on test.Android 8.1 Oreo runs lickety-split on the Note 9, and Samsung's S Pen integrates with it seamlessly, too.Many requests that I felt it would be able to handle it didn't register, or if it did register them, sometimes it would do random things that weren't particularly useful.Asking, for example, ""Hi Bixby, how long will it take me to get home today?"" saw Bixby open The Weather Channel, while reporting ""I couldn't find the specific weather condition you asked for, here's the overall weather instead"".Ask Google Assistant, which is also available on the Note 9, the exact same question, and within a second a Google Maps box has opened with a time estimate to my house and a recommended route.What's more, some of the more advanced features that Samsung demonstrated at the Note 9's Galaxy Unpacked event, such as the ability for Bixby to order you a taxi are not yet supported, with Bixby returning me the error message: ""Sorry, for now the function is not supported.""These limitations and inconsistencies, naturally, make you lean towards using Google Assistant. However, Samsung still does not allow you to customise the Bixby button, so that you could use it to raise the more powerful, functional AI assistant.Yes, there are ways to get round this via third party apps, however that is not an ideal scenario and really I don't feel you should be dodging round something that seems like it would be pretty straightforward for Samsung to fix.Overall, I feel if you play to Bixby's strengths, such as opening core system apps, sending messages, performing music searches, setting reminders, checking the weather, and raising Samsung's own software like Samsung Health, then you'll get a pretty solid and consistent experience on Note 9. But, stray outside of them, and you'll very quickly discover Bixby remains a work in progress.Here's hoping those more advanced features get added to Bixby soon.You can really make the most out of the Note 9's Super AMOLED display by tweaking screen options. Device Maintenance remains as simple and straightforward as ever.The Note 9 runs Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box and, as you would expect from a phone coming out in the shadow of the impending Android 9 Pie launch, it runs like a bug-free dream on the Note 9.The Samsung Experience software, which replaced the crude and unpopular Samsung TouchWiz from earlier Galaxy devices, has also reached an incredibly refined level on the Note 9, with it guiding you at all times with useful hints and pointers in how you can navigate the very open and complex operating system on offer.Combined, Android 8.1 Oreo, along with Samsung Experience and security platform Samsung Knox, deliver a rapid, secure mobile and computing environment, which hopefully will only be added to in terms of speed and security when the Note 9 gets its inevitable Android 9 Pie update in a few months time.The software partnering the Note 9's new S Pen digital stylus also syncs seamlessly with Oreo. Extracting the S Pen when the phone is unlocked causes a dedicated overlay to appear with a customisable app wheel, allowing you to quickly make a note, or run an app. I have to confess that I added Football Manager Mobile 2018 to this almost immediately (seriously, the S Pen is perfect for configuring your false 9 formation). And, talking of gaming…Fortnite is a launch exclusive for the Note 9 and certain other Galaxy devices.A key piece of gaming software on the Note 9 is the launch-exclusive Fortnite third-person online PVP shooter by Epic Games.Fortnite is playable now on the Note 9, as well as other Galaxy devices from the Galaxy S7 and up, and I can confirm that it shows off the gaming power locked into the phone very well, even if the install process to get there is slightly laboured by a non-Play Store standalone installer and patcher (I'd recommend checking for updates before you leave the house each morning, as otherwise your data plan is going to be destroyed).The bright and violent world of Fortnite is well shown off by the Note 9's 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen, which also gives you plenty of real-estate to control your character accurately, and runs smoothly on the Snapdragon 845 CPU with 6GB of RAM combo.Performance in modern, graphically impressive mobile games like DBZ Legends was very impressive on the Note 9.This slick performance was carried over into other graphically impressive Android games, such as Tekken, Final Fantasy XV Pocket Edition, and DBZ Legends.Now look, by this point most flagship Android phones run these games well, so the Note 9 certainly isn't in a league of its own or anything, but with its gorgeous, best phone screen in the world Super AMOLED display, along with its impressive Dolby Atmos-toting audio, it definitely delivers a zero-compromise mobile gaming platform.The Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is the best Android smartphone in the world.With the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 picture now fully viewable, I feel we are left with a device that is one of the very best Android smartphones in the world right now.And, that is despite the Note 9 dropping the ball slightly with Samsung's half-baked Bixby AI assistant and merely competitive, not standout battery.The Note 9 seems to have completed a transition from productivity powerhouse for work-orientated, smartphone enthusiasts, into simply a phone that excels across the board, delivering a piece of hardware that makes gaming, listening to music, and watching TV and movies, as well as mobile computing in all its forms, a no compromise experience.As such, if you can afford the Samsung Galaxy Note 9's admittedly high price point, I wholeheartedly recommend it.3 May 2019: A new update is being pushed out to the Note 9 which allows users to set a schedule for Night Mode and switch to a wider field of view when taking selfies (from the default 68 degrees to 80 degrees). This selfie mode first appeared on the Samsung Galaxy S10 phones and was brought to the Galaxy S9 in March. Sammobile tested the update and confirmed that it does not bring a night mode to the camera app – that's likely to stay an S10 exclusive for now, at least.16 May 2019: Good news everybody! Samsung is rolling out a new software update for the Galaxy Note 9, which brings the very latest Android security patch to the handset. Right now the roll-out is restricted to to Russia, France and Bulgaria, however other countries are soon expected to follow. If the update follows the one that was recently released for the Samsung Galaxy S9, then the changes should fix a series of 21 identified vulnerabilities. To check if you can get the update, head to the phone's Software update menu in the Note 9's settings and then select Download and install.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review
60,Apple iPhone 11 Pro,Apple iPhone 11 Pro review: the best camera and screen on a phone,"Welcome to T3's iPhone 11 Pro review, where we'll put Apple's new top-of-the-line phone through its paces to find out if it deserves its 'pro' moniker.Apple made a big deal about the new triple camera system during the phone's announcement, and also highlighted an improved screen and better battery life… but it turns out that this year's upgrades are more comprehensive than you might think.Of course, the camera is still the standout, and we'll go on a deep dive to show you why. But there's lot more to consider when it comes to the questions of updating from an older model.The iPhone 11 Pro starts from £1,049, for the 5.8-inch model with 64GB of storage. There's also the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which has a 6.5-inch screen and longer battery life, but is otherwise identical when it comes to specs. That starts from £1,149 for 64GB.You can upgrade to get more storage space. £150 more gets you 256GB. Another £200 on top of that gets you 512GB. It's a pretty hefty premium in both cases, and Apple still doesn't include a microSD card slot.For most people, 64GB is a pretty reasonable size anyway, but if you like to keep a lot of movies downloaded (or take a lot of your own), or will download loads of games through Apple Arcade, the 256GB version is a solid upgrade in terms of size.These are damn expensive phones, though the £1,000 mark is now not uncommon – the Samsung Galaxy Note10+ comes in at £999, and just like that model, these are Apple's highest-end offerings.If it's more than you're willing to spend on a phone, it's totally understandable – the iPhone 11 (non-Pro version) starts from £729, with far fewer cut corners than you'd expect.The iPhone 11 Pro is available in four colours: Space Grey (black on all sides), Silver (silver edges and a white back), Gold (warm gold edges with a back that's like a dark peach), and the new Midnight Green (with dark green edges, and kind of moody forest green back).The latter is apparently wildly popular, which is no surprise for a new colour. It looks lovely – it's really dark, and in dim lighting could be mistaken for black, but it clearly has this rich green tint in all other lights.The design of the 11 Pro is almost identical to the iPhone XS, including the use of stainless steel on the sides with glass across the back.The glass has been upgraded again, and is the toughest glass ever on a smartphone, Apple says. The XS was really impressive in this regard, something that I tested empirically more times than I intended.A falling phone is still far too unpredictable for us to be able to guarantee that the new model won't break after a fall, but your odds are better, and that's all you can ask for, really.The only notable changes to the look are on the back: the camera, and the texture on the glass plate.The big triple camera looks far better than it has any right to (though still is not quite a thing of unambiguous beauty). The trick is that it draws from classic design: much like the iPod evoked Braun radios, this is built like triple-lens film cameras such as the Crown8 E3.The thick ring around each lens on the iPhone leans into this heritage – it makes the camera look practical and important, rather than like Apple has failed to hide it (as can be the case).I'm not sure it's necessarily better-looking than the central camera arrays on the Samsung S10 or Huawei Mate 30, but I've become quite fond of its physicality.The entire glass back of the phone now has an etched texture to it, which makes it more reliable to grip without a case. This is extremely welcome, because I learned exactly which surfaces in my home were flat and which weren't by watching the iPhone XS inevitably work its way towards edges and take a tumble.On the front, there's still a hefty notch that can't help but make the design look a little behind rivals with punch-holes or pop-up cameras, which give you the full screen to view.In practice, it's not a problem in any way – iOS has been designed around the notch, and Apple's secure (and now faster) Face ID needs chunkier sensors – but it does feel behind the curve, which isn't exactly what you want from a £1k+ phone. Especially when other high-end phones are coming with super-futuristic in-screen fingerprint sensors that work great, which we ultimately prefer to face recognition.That brings us to the screen, which is our first unqualified rave review for the 11 Pro. Now peaking at 1,200 lumens when viewing HDR photos or video, it's basically like having an OLED telly in your hand.HDR videos, and especially Dolby Vision, look absolutely incredible. There's no HDR10+ support, but given that this is barely used so far (Amazon Prime Video supports it), while Dolby Vision is on both Netflix and the iTunes Store, we don't mind this omission too much. HDR10+ videos will still fall back to regular HDR10, which is fully supported.The wide P3 colour gamut makes photos look vibrant and realistic, and everything is pin-sharp. It's utterly, utterly gorgeous.The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have the same screen density (over 400ppi), but at different resolutions, so there's no difference in sharpness. For movie buffs, there's a strong argument to get the bigger model just to really, really enjoy the display.Apple has included new 'spatial audio' speakers, with Dolby Atmos support. The effect is really impressive – there's clear separation of left and right, and you can hear nuance in the position of sounds from the front in movies, though you don't exactly get the full rear-speaker experience, unsurprisingly.Of course, most people will probably use headphones for movies, but the new speaker setup has other advantages: it's super loud, and offers balance and quality that pretty much kills off the need for cheap Bluetooth speakers. It's even better and louder for calls – compared to the iPhone XS, the difference was noticeable from the very first ring tone we heard.Okay, this is the big section. The iPhone 11 Pro is Apple's first rear triple-camera system, in a year that's been full of them. The third lens is another first for the iPhone: an ultra-wide lens. These again are now de rigeur for phones, having arrived on just about every high-end handset in the last 12 months.The ultra-wide lens brings a 120-degree field of view, which is ideal for landscapes, getting crazy perspective shots, shooting tall or wide objects, or 'zooming out' on a shot when you can't walk backwards any further.That's in addition to the standard wide-angle lens and 2x telephoto lenses that the device inherits from the iPhone XS (this dual setup was also found on the iPhone X, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone 7 Plus).These remain largely unchanged, with two small but impactful updates. The first is that the telephoto lens now has a larger aperture, which lets in 40% more light – this makes it noticeably better in situations that don't involve bright sunlight, and makes for more detailed portrait shots, as we'll see.The second is that the wide-angle sensor now has 100% focus pixels, which is tech talk for saying that it's much faster and more accurate at focusing, especially in very low light. This is vital for the new Night mode option, which is exclusive to the 11 series of iPhones.The camera interface has been rethought to make it easier to access different controls just under your thumb.Like similar options on other devices (Google's Night Sight, Samsung's Bright Night, etc), this takes a slow shot in very dark conditions and pulls out colour and detail that would be totally lost normally.To accommodate all this, there's a new design of the Camera app that's exclusive to iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. The flashiest difference is that the live view of what's being shot isn't just limited to the main viewfinder – if you're using the wide-angle lens, a faint view of what the ultra-wide is seeing is displayed under the buttons, making it a bit easier to decide whether you want to change your zoom level.It's nice, though oddly doesn't always appear when you're in the 1x wide-angle lens. At first, we suspected a bug, but it seems to be connected to focus distance: if you're shooting an object at fairly close range, you get a black interface. Pull back a little and the view from the ultra-wide fades in. Apple didn't return a request for clarification about exactly how this works before publication.Our favourite other difference is 'Quick Take' shooting, in which if you press and hold the shutter button, you'll capture video instead of pictures, which no change of modes needed. And if you slide your thumb left, you'll lock into recording video, and don't need to hold any more. If you want to shoot bursts (which is what used to happen when you held the shutter button), you slide right. It's a small change, but being able to rapidly switch between stills and video when your kid does something cute is so, so useful.A bunch of handy controls have been made more accessible (just swipe over the different shooting modes to bring up a different set of buttons) and there's a new icon for Night mode in the corner. This shows whether Night mode is active (it fires up automatically when needed), and how long you'll need to hold still for Night mode to work.The length of time will typically be one or three seconds if you're holding the iPhone in your hand: iOS calculates the time needed by looking at light levels and your hand shake. If you can go very still by leaning on something, it'll boost to five seconds. When you press the trigger, a little timer counts down to when the shot is complete.You can actually manually override the timing if you're feeling confident, though – you can set it up to 30 seconds, in fact. You will need a tripod for this to be effective, but you can produce stunning starlight photography from this.As we've hinted at above, the result of all this is astounding image quality, so let's look at some examples. First up, how the three lenses compare.All shots from iPhone 11 Pro. Left to right: 2x telephoto; wide-angle; ultra-wide. See a larger version here.Here, we've chosen a subject that's not far away. Note that the telephoto preserves a good amount of detail in the shadow on the door's right-hand side. Apple's Smart HDR has had an upgrade this year too, with great results that we'll see more of soon.Without moving our feet at all, we go from the door filling the frame to taking up just a small portion in the centre. The ultra-wide lens is 0.5x magnification compared to the central wide-angle lens, and the telephoto is 2x the wide-angle, meaning you've got a full zoom range of 4x from end to end.Here's what that means for taking in a whole building:All shots from iPhone 11 Pro. Left to right: 2x telephoto; wide-angle; ultra-wide. See a larger version here.A few things to note here. First, the colour and light level matching between the three cameras is astoundingly similar. Look at the lovely warm, nuanced sunny glow on the building's side, and how this translates from shot to shot. Getting this kind of light in the shots and keeping it consistent is one of the triumphs of the new camera system – we'll go more into that later.Apple says it put a lot of effort into calibrating the lenses to match, so you that you can switch between the zoom levels without worrying about white balance or contrast changing drastically. This is not only great for lining up shots, but carries over to video too, where you can switch between lenses in the middle of recording without everything shifting in hue.You'll notice there's a fair amount of lens distortion clear towards the edges of the frame. This shot was especially hard on the camera for that, because elements near the edges are quite a bit closer than the subject in the middle. It's something that's unavoidable from a lens like this – Apple does some automatic correction, but in harder situations, you'll still get the effect.Now, let's move onto Night mode.Top: iPhone XS Max. Bottom: iPhone 11 Pro Night mode. See a larger version here.This is an interesting comparison because you could, quite fairly, decide that you like the top photo more, because it's much closer to what the eye sees. It has an moody aesthetic value all of its own, and doesn't disgrace the outgoing iPhone XS' camera by any means.Of course, the iPhone 11 Pro could take a nearly identical shot to that one if you simply turn off Night mode deliberately. (Incidentally, Night mode only works on the wide-angle camera: if you try to use it in ultra-wide, it will turn on the flash instead. If you try to do it in telephoto, it just switches to the wide angle and uses digital zoom to mimic the telephoto, because the light capture is much better in that lens.)However, Night mode has given us not only a cool hyper-real light aesthetic of its own, but also just blows us away with everything it's picked up. What looks like a sea of black to the iPhone XS includes a sharp dramatic shadow from the fence. The church roof is summoned from nowhere. Half a tree reappears over on the right!And here's the killer part about Apple's Night mode: it pulls out so much detail too. It's superior to Google's fabled mode for this, and it's one reason we're often happy to see it triggering for just a second even in situations that don't seem that dark: sometimes when it fires up, it barely lightens things, but it does produce so much more detail.In the bigger version of the shot above, you'll see brickwork and sharper fence diamonds all get pulled in by Night mode. But here's an even more stark example:Top left: iPhone X. Top Right: iPhone XS Max. Bottom left: iPhone 11 Pro standard. Bottom right: iPhone 11 Pro Night mode. See a larger version here.You see that each generation of iPhone taken in normal mode has a small but noticeable bump in contrast and detail over the last… and then we get to the last Night mode shot, which is on another level. Smeary pixels suddenly turn into rocks with texture and presence.Let's do another multi-generational test, this time in Portrait mode, using the telephoto lens (the iPhone 11 Pro can now do Portrait mode in other lenses, which is a nice bit of flexibility to have).Left to right: iPhone 11 Pro; iPhone XS Max; iPhone X. See a larger version here.There's not much to choose between the 11 Pro and XS Max shots on an overview – the 11 Pro is pulling a slightly warmer tone that is probably somewhat more accurate to the day, but maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part about how sallow my skin is. The updated Smart HDR system in the 11 Pro has boosted the brightness in the shaded side of my face slightly, but both look good overall.Note my shirt, though: the Portrait depth has done a much more realistic job on the new device, keeping realistic texture and detail on the front, and blurring slightly as you reach my shoulder. The XS' is muddy by comparison.Now compare the 11 Pro to the iPhone X on the right – the colour is paler again, and the shirt is worse than the XS. Also, the lack of Smart HDR means that the shine of the sun on my forehead has lost any detail at all around there. The X shot once more isn't bad as an overview, though. But let's go closer.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone X. See a 100% version here.Now we're comparing the 11 Pro to the X properly, which I think is the most appropriate and useful option: most people have an X or 8 Plus (which have exactly the same cameras, pretty much) or earlier, so if you're looking at an upgrade to the 11 Pro, this is the difference you'll really see.There are drastic detail improvements across the whole face here. More textured hair, crisper edges to the glasses, some actual white in my eyes, and especially the right ear (in the shade). The iPhone X has pretty much abandoned it to noise and grain, but it's still solid in the new phone.Look at the Portrait effect, too: my ears and hair drop gently out of focus in the 11 Pro shot; the X doesn't have the same realism to it.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone X. See a larger version here.Sticking with our 11 Pro versus X theme, we're again shown how the X produces perfectly serviceable pictures, but the 11 Pro's are just so much nicer. The X's shot here doesn't have such a wide dynamic range, so where the 11 Pro's shot has bright warm sunset sun casting shadows on the hills to give them a 3D look, the X's shot is colder and less rich.The 11 Pro's shot is also significantly sharper when you view it at a larger size – not that big of a deal overall, but useful if you plan to crop in at all.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone X. See a larger version here.Now we test the telephoto lens on both. In this daylight shot, the quality is comparable from an overview. But we've chosen this shot because we want to see the lovely weathering on the old sign. And when you view bigger, or on a screen with any amount of detail, the X shot reveals the relative lack of lustre. The flaking sign looks like it's just part of the globe.One the 11 Pro, you can see the peeling, and see that there's a subtle 3D element to its flaking. The ironwork and the walls behind also have much clearer detail.So, in like-for-like shots in beautiful bright conditions, we're not talking about the 11 Pro giving you a giant transformation from the iPhone X, 8 Plus or earlier. You'll get a shot that's better in every way, but the X isn't bad!However, in low-light conditions, the 11 Pro is a giant leap ahead when it comes to Night mode, and is generally a notable improvement over anything but the XS when it comes to regular low-light shots.Between Night mode and the zoom and angle options afforded by the three lenses, this will feel like a whole new beast compared to an older iPhones.There are also improvements to the front camera. It now has a wider view, which is used optionally – by default, you'll get the same viewing angle as before, suited to one or two people. But tap a button and you switch to a wider view for groups. Handy.Apple says the 11 Pro has the highest-quality video ever for a phone, and we can well believe that. First, the detail and dynamic range of its shots are just astounding, especially in 4K.But one thing that really helps with that is the new image stabilisation. Apple is underplaying this – it's only been mentioned lightly, but it provides fantastic smooth footage when handheld. It's not made to be like an action camera level of smoothing, but it's much more transformative than you might think from its lack of promotion.It pretty much puts an end to nasty jerky home videos – you get stuff that looks you had pro equipment instead. We love it.It's not just about iPhone vs iPhone comparison is it? What if you're considering another equivalently priced, state-of-the-art phone too? Like the Samsung Galaxy Note10. Well, we took that out with the 11 Pro for a spin, too.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: Samsung Galaxy Note10. See a larger version here.Here's how the ultra-wide-angle shots on both cameras stack up. The shot from the Samsung is brighter around the shop fronts, and the colours are more vibrant – see the leaves, the yellow building, the dirt in the foreground, the signs in the window of the shop on the left.The iPhone is handling lens flare from the sun better (and proved seriously better than pretty much any phone we've tried for this, in fact, which is no small thing), but everything else looks a little less inviting and 'ready to share'.This is, simply, how Samsung likes to do things. The Note10 captures dynamic range excellently, but goes heavy on the processing to make it look bright and Insta-worthy right off the bat (with, we think, some calibration to make shots really suit its screen). It aims to keep every bit of highlight detail, which is technically impressive, but leads to images that are a bit flat.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: Samsung Galaxy Note10. See a 100% version here.This is from the top-right of the images above. What Samsung is doing is boosting the light and applying lots of sharpening, which are cramming the shadowed areas with noise, and dropping detail.Essentially, Samsung is applying the kind of appealing filters that most people would add before sending to Facebook right to the images. Apple is giving you a much more realistic view of the light in the scene.Personally, I prefer Apple's approach, because I can always still tweak the picture using the new and improved editing tools in iOS to look like Samsung's. But you can't dial back what Samsung is doing to get a more realistic shot.But this is very much an aesthetic and effort thing – if you like what Samsung does with the shots and don't want to be processing it yourself, then this approach is is helpful. If you stay zoomed out on that original image above, you'd never really notice the noise.The iPhone's ultra-wide lens also handles issues such as chromatic aberration better than the Samsung. It's small, but if you're going to name your phone 'Pro' it's the kind of thing you should be getting right, so it's good that Apple is.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: Samsung Galaxy Note10. See a larger version here.Your eyes do not deceive you: the more vibrant image on the left is the Apple shot. What seems to have happened here is the Samsung's penchant for crushing the dynamic range has caused it to lose the warmth of the colours, as well as the nuance.But that's not all – let's go closer:Left: Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Right: Samsung Galaxy Note10. View a 100% version here.Here we see Samsung's gung-ho automatic sharpening has made fluffy wool look more like stiff twine. This isn't just a thing you have to zoom in to notice: go back up to the zoomed-out comparison and you can see Apple's shot has extra physicality in the wool itself as well as from its handling of the light.Left: Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Right: Samsung Galaxy Note10. See a bigger version here.Here's a shot that gives the Samsung's vibrancy boost a big canvas, and is a good chance for you to see that aesthetic difference we were talking about: you can probably recognise that the bright red of the Samsung's shot is not exactly realistic, but – a bit like we said about Night mode – it has a hyper-real appeal of its own.This shows the best and worst of Samsung's sharpening: it makes the texture on the phone box look even more touchable and prominent, but also makes the red text on the white sign look artificial, like it's been Photoshopped on. And compare the walls of the buildings on both shots – Samsung has sharpened away any texture.Again, the Apple shot is lower-key, but more realistic. Samsung's shots look excellent at phone size, but Apple's shots will stand being made bigger or printed.On top of this, the iPhone's Camera app also gives you a more realistic preview of the pic you'll actually capture compared to the Samsung, which is always important.What the iPhone does well with its photos, it does subtly – but in combination, its handling of detail, dynamic range and colour given everything a warm realism that's superior not just to the Note10, but to everything else we've tried so far. Even if the difference isn't always massive.That said, we do wish we could have the longer zoom range of the Huawei P30 Pro for even more flexibility. And we wouldn't blame anyone for wanting that flexibility over the pure image quality on show here. But we're still calling Apple the winner of the current camera Royal Rumble.Speaking of sports metaphors, Apple is the undisputed champ when it comes to phone processor performance. As the rest of the industry catches up with last year's A12 chip, here we have the A13, which adds more power.The exact difference depends on what you're doing, and the phone will also feel faster because iOS 13 has a bunch of software optimisation to open and install apps faster.In Geekbench 4, the difference is about 13% in single-core performance, and 22% in multi-core power. In Geekbench 5, it's about 20% in single-core, and 22% in single core.Compared to the Samsung Note10, Apple's lead is clear: the 11 Pro leads the Note10 by 22% in single-core performance, and a brutal 50% in multi-core Geekbench 4 scores.But then, it's not like the Samsung Note10 ever felt slow to us, nor have the last few iPhones. Apple dominance here is technical, not so much practical. That said, it's nice to know you have the headroom for things like recording multiple video streams from the cameras at once, or advanced editing. You may not do it, but if you ever wanted to, you could.The other changes in the processor are bigger graphics power, a more powerful neural processor (which enables more advanced image processing, including Night mode and 'Deep Fusion', which is a new way of boosting image quality coming to these phones later in the year), and better power management.That last one is the important bit, and also leads us to the thing that may tempt iPhone XS owners to upgrade after just a year: the battery life.Apple has increased battery physical capacity significantly in the 11 Pro models, and has introduced much smarter power use of the A13 processor.The result is a major boost of battery life – Apple says four more hours for this 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro model compared to its predecessor, and five hours for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.I don't have the new Max to test at this time, but I've tested the regular 11 Pro to death, and the results are great.Here's the bottom line: the smaller iPhone model now gets as much battery life as the iPhone XS Max did.I'm an extremely heavy user, and it's normal for the iPhone XS Max to be pretty much spent for me at the end of a day. The 11 Pro reaches the same point, despite being so much smaller.The Geekbench 4 battery benchmarks bear this out too: the iPhone 11 Pro scores basically the same as a new XS Max (it actually scores slightly better than my year-old one, but batteries do degrade over time).This is a massive jump from any previous iPhone, including last year's model – it's easily one of the juiciest reasons for anyone to upgrade.Apple doesn't have any official fast-charging listing, but if you use a higher-power plug, you can charge an iPhone damn quickly – and Apple now includes an 18W charger in the box for the Pro models, which has folding plug pins, usefully.[An earlier version of this review mistakenly stated that the iPhone 11 Pro shipped with a 5W charger – my apologies for the mistake.]There's wireless charging again, of course, but the rumoured bi-direction charging (so you could top up your AirPods from your phone) is absent. This is a shame – it's not an essential feature, but in a pinch, it's a great option to have.We'll also talk about iOS 13 here. As an update, it's broadly good, but it's definitely a bit of a mixed bag. The first launch has been buggy, and while iOS 13.1 has just arrived at the time of writing, we haven't had enough time to be able to say how much it improves things.There are lots of small changes in how it works, some better than others. The new Dark mode option is good to have, especially because it can be set to come on at certain times. Conversely, the new Share menu now needs more scrolling to find options that were closer to hand, and hides things that used to be more accessible. But it also makes other options more accessible and quicker to access, so it's swings and roundabouts.The frosted glass back is a new look for Apple, and it adds grip, so the phone is easier to hold safely without a case.Some of the changes are not very well explained, either. The new Camera app has a little guide when you open it, but there's been confusion online from people about the fact that the 'Find my iPhone' and 'Find my Friends' apps have been merged into on new app called 'Find my'. Apple's principle here is fine, but you can't just take away an app and not tell people they can find the same functionality elsewhere.There is a big change in here that's a mix of software and hardware, though: there's no 3D Touch any more. The writing was on the wall when it was left out of the iPhone XR last year, but no new iPhones have it at all.There's still a version of it, called 'Haptic touch', which can best be described as 'tapping and holding on something'.As an iPhone power user, I was pretty used to using 3D Touch's clever little shortcuts, and losing it is a bit frustrating. Some things are slower, such as using the torch or camera buttons on the lock screen – it takes a moment longer to trigger, them. Not much, but still a regression. And you used to be able to hard press anywhere on a keyboard to move the cursor, where as now you have to long-press on the space bar. It's just a little slower, a little more fiddly.Some apps don't support the ability to peek at links before you open them using long press – again, not the biggest loss in the world, but I used it, and now I can't.Apple has said that losing 3D Touch saved thickness in the screen, which has been put towards extra battery capacity. So in the context of that trade-off, we'll live with it, and after a week of use, our muscle memory is already getting overwritten. But, like other parts of iOS 13, the transition has been clunky.The iPhone 11 Pro is officially waterproof, enough to survive drops into the bath or sink.Finally, Apple has improved wireless connectivity across the board here. An extra Bluetooth antenna gives longer range, which is great for headphones and Apple Watch – we've seen the connections for both last clearly longer distances.There's also support for Wi-Fi 6, and Gigabit 4G. There's no 5G, but we never expected there to be – Apple waits for new tech like this to settle down a little before it includes it. It's obviously a shame if you live in a 5G area, but they're still relatively rare and patchy – Apple says it's focusing on the best 4G speeds possible right now, because it improves things for the most people.Lastly, Apple has included support for Ultra-wideband, which is kind of like a next-gen Bluetooth – it can send information over short distances, but also includes accurate location-detection tech. Right now, it's only used for AirDropping files between devices (point your phone at another 11-series iPhone and it will be first on the list), but the potential is huge. An pair of AirPods with Ultra-wideband that you can locate down the back of a sofa using AR is absolutely on the cards, at some point. It's great future-proofing to have.If you have an iPhone numbered 8 or lower, I think this is the perfect time to upgrade generally. Both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro get you better screens, brilliant cameras, great newer designs, much better battery life, as well as faster performance. Across the board, they're full of big improvements that you'll notice every day. But it doesn't matter too much whether you go for the £729 iPhone 11 or £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro – both are a big leap forward.I know a lot of iPhone SE users really don't want a bigger phone, and have always hoped Apple would accommodate them, but those phones are getting long in the tooth, and Apple (like other manufacturers) doesn't seem interested in smaller phones. I think the iPhone 11 Pro is the best option for those people: it doesn't match the SE for cheapness, but it's the most compact of the new phones.If you have an iPhone XS, it's probably not worth the upgrade – you've already got a screen that very nearly as good, and a camera system that's not far off. Those who travel a lot and love taking pics while on the move should consider that the ultra-wide lens will give them some excellent new creative options, and there's no denying that Night mode is a huge thing. But I think the battery life will probably be what wins you over if you do decide to upgrade – it's a powerful change. If you haven't been finding the battery on your XS limiting, then I think you should seriously consider waiting a year.The design of the rear camera calls to mind triple-lens vintage film cameras – it shouldn't look good, but it does.It's the best iPhone ever, of course, but how could it be anything else? But it's also better than it looks, and better than Apple's own announcements seemed to let on.I'm reminded of the Ship of Theseus, which asks: if you replace every beam and bolt of a ship with a new one, is it still the same ship?The iPhone 11 Pro looks so similar to its predecessor, but almost every single part has been switched out for something new and better. The screen is brighter, the camera is far better, the speaker is improved, the wireless is faster, the battery is bigger, the processor is more powerful… the individual changes don't feel that big, but the sum makes for a really solid year-on-year upgrade. This is absolutely a new, shinier ship.It does come at a very high price, though. We'd expect the iPhone 11 to be the more popular model by a long way, because it strikes a superb balance of features to price. But if you want the very best technology that you can get in an iPhone, you won't feel short-changed here.August 2020 – Read our iOS 14 hands-on review to learn about the great new features coming to iPhone 11 Pro in the next big update.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/apple-iphone-11-pro-review
61,Samsung Galaxy S10e,Samsung Galaxy S10e review: Samsung's pocket superstar impresses in almost every way,"Dimensions: 142.2 x 69.9 x 7.9 mmWeight: 150 gScreen: 5.8-inch, 19:9, 438 ppi (1,080 x 2,280)CPU: Exynos 9820RAM: 6-8GBStorage: 128-256GBBattery: 3,100mAhCameras: 12MP+16MP rear / 10MP frontOS: Android 9.0 Pie, One UIJust as Apple did with the iPhone XR, Samsung has sprung a new, cheaper model on the world with its annual flagship refresh – the Samsung S10e is the most affordable of the new S10 phones, behind the standard Galaxy S10, the Galaxy S10 Plus, and the Galaxy S10 5G model.It might not cost as much as the other phones in the S10 range, but does it represent better value for money? Or would you be better off spending more to get more options and features? We've been testing out the Galaxy S10e for almost a week now, and so can give you a considered verdict.We'll explain how the Galaxy S10e differs from other models in the family, and give you an idea of why you might or might not want to make it your next smartphone upgrade.Samsung Galaxy S10eThe Samsung Galaxy S10e is available to buy right now in a choice of distinctive colours – white, black, green and yellow, at the time of writing in the UK. The 6GB RAM and 128GB storage option is the one on offer in the UK, though some regions will get the option of 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage.The price is £669 direct from Samsung, putting it £130 lower than the starting price of the Galaxy S10, and £230 lower than the starting price of the Galaxy S10 Plus. That's a substantial saving, and we'll explain further down why you might think it's worth it.The Galaxy S10e is available from a variety of retailers and carriers as well of course. If you head over to Carphone Warehouse, you'll find the phone on offer for £36.99 per month with an upfront cost of £49.99, for example – that gets you 30GB of data a month on EE together with unlimited minutes and unlimited texts.Samsung Galaxy S10eSamsung has been making nicely designed, well-built smartphones for years now, and the Samsung Galaxy S10e follows that tradition – don't make the mistake of thinking that because the Galaxy S10e is cheaper, it's cheaply put together.New this year for Samsung is the hole-punch, Infinity-O display, and it looks perfectly fine, even on the smaller display of the S10e. Around the front we've got thin bezels and carefully moulded glass, and around the back there's a shiny but grippable casing that looks great too (the stylish selection of colours help here).We're big fans of the design of the Samsung Galaxy S10e and if Samsung has been skimping on materials in order to keep the price down then it doesn't show – at first and indeed second and third glances this looks just as premium as the S10 and S10 Plus.Samsung Galaxy S10eIt's a little bit thicker than the standard S10 (measuring 7.9mm rather than 7.8mm), but you're hardly going to notice that unless you're lining them both up in a lab. Also, while he edges of the device are rounded, the display stays flat rather than being curved as it is on the more expensive S10 phones.That might not please some, but we actually prefer it – it makes it easier to see the edges of the screen, and avoids any accidental presses. As far as design and build quality goes, we're only talking about minor differences.The big difference here is of course the size, with the S10e screen measuring 5.8 inches compared with the 6.1 inches of the S10 and the 6.4 inches of the S10 Plus. That gives you less space for your apps, but means the S10e is more pocket-friendly.The smartphone is also rated IP68 for water and dust resistance, which means it can withstand a swim in 1.5 metres of water for half an hour – you don't have to be afraid of it taking a quick dunk but it won't survive a week at the bottom of the ocean.Samsung Galaxy S10eEven by Samsung's standards, the Dynamic AMOLED screen on the front of the Galaxy S10e is something special. It might be smaller and a lower resolution (1080 x 2280 pixels) than the other S10 phones, but it still looks fantastic: deep and vibrant colours, deep blacks, and excellent brightness and contrast are the order of the day.That smaller screen means less of everything on screen, whether it's a message conversation or a webpage. It might really get on your nerves, if you're used to something with a bigger screen, or it might not bother you at all, if you're just glad to have a device that can be used easily in one hand.And it absolutely can be used with one hand – if you don't like the trend towards bigger and bigger phones, the Samsung Galaxy S10e could be the handset for you. That more compact screen, and the thin bezels, means this is easily gripped in one hand.We watched numerous Netflix and YouTube videos, breezed through some photo albums, and surfed across our favourite parts of the web, and every time the display was a joy to use, as you would expect from a Samsung AMOLED panel in 2019. The 1080p resolution is more than enough for a 5.8-inch display, and there's support for HDR10 content too.Under the hood is the same processor in the S10 or S10 Plus: the Snapdragon 855 or Exynos 9820, depending on your region. That's paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, or 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and a memory card slot is available for adding even more room.While the S10 and S10 Plus offer more powerful configurations (up to 12GB of RAM and 1TB of storage space in the case of the S10 Plus), the Galaxy S10e is still a very, very powerful phone. You're going to struggle to find anything faster than it in 2019, which isn't bad for what is supposedly the lower end model in the S10 family.Samsung Galaxy S10eDon't forget that a smaller screen and a lower resolution means fewer pixels to push. Apps and menus zip by on the Samsung Galaxy S10e, and it had no problems coping with the games we played on it – from intricate puzzlers to high-octane racing games.As we've said, if you're used to a bigger display, then the more compact keyboard and lack of room for your Twitter timeline or Spotify playlists might start to grate. However, once you get used to it, the smaller size is fine – and you certainly won't complain if you're coming from a handset of similar dimensions.The extra RAM available on the S10 and S10 Plus phones might come in handy for really big apps and really demanding multitasking, but honestly the Galaxy S10e is going to do you proud and remain responsive for years to come. Just like the iPhone XR, it's not the performance levels where the S10e cuts corners to keep the prices down.[CPU test]Single-core: 4,446Multi-core: 10,173[Compute test]Compute score: 10,369[Battery test]Battery score estimate: 2,672Samsung Galaxy S10eThe camera system is one of the areas where the Samsung Galaxy S10e gives you less than the Galaxy S10 or the Galaxy S10 Plus. You only get a dual-lens rear camera rather than a triple-lens setup – the 12MP+16MP camera system is still capable of taking some impressive snaps, but you miss out on extras like the 2x optical zoom available on the other S10 models.You get the same bokeh blur Live Focus mode that's on the S10 and S10 Plus, but the lack of a third sensor means the depth calculations and overall effects aren't quite as polished – though that's perhaps something you're not going to worry about unless you're planning to show off your snaps in an exhibition.We liked taking photos with the Samsung Galaxy S10e. The shots it gets are bright and clear, and the shutter speed and focus are quick – it really is a question of pointing and shooting when you've got the Samsung S10e in your pocket.Samsung Galaxy S10eAs with just about every smartphone out there, the problems start when the light goes down. The S10e can't capture low light information as well as the S10, and is quite a way behind something like the Google Pixel 3. There is a Bright Night feature that tries to make software adjustments, but we found it rather hit and miss.This is still a top-level Samsung phone, and with that in mind you can still get some decent night time shots if there's a bit of light around and you can keep the phone still for a second or so. However, it's not going to set new standards for mobile photography in low light conditions, far from it. If you can live with that, then you might consider the savings you make on the cost of the S10e worth it.The lack of any optical zoom is a disappointment, but you have to make compromises somewhere if you're making a more affordable S10. The ultra-wide angle lens that's in the rear camera of the S10e (and the S10 and S10 Plus) is really useful though, letting you take a virtual step back from a scene to fit more in the picture.Samsung has packed in a variety of features and tricks on the software side, including a scene analyser that tells you when it thinks you're framing your shot in the best way (you can switch it off if you find it annoying). There are also a wider choice of scene modes to pick between, if you need some extra help beyond the automatic settings.All told, the dual-lens camera on the Samsung Galaxy S10e doesn't disappoint – it just doesn't hit the heights of some of the best flagships of 2019. We'd say it's at least on a par with and in many cases better than the flagships of 2018, including the Galaxy S9, so that's something to consider if you're thinking of upgrading.As you can see from our sample shots, colour reproduction and detail is good, and you're going to be able to grab some really nice shots for social media or showing off to friends and family. Yes, there are phones with better cameras out there on the market at the moment, but they tend to cost more too.Samsung Galaxy S10eThe 3,100mAh battery packed inside the Samsung Galaxy S10e will easily see you through a day, perhaps because of that smaller, lower-resolution screen: we typically had around 15-20 percent left by bedtime after a full charge in the morning, though don't forget we were using a brand new phone, so you can probably expect that to go down over time.In our usual and rather rough battery test, where we play an hour of Netflix at maximum brightness and 50 percent volume, the Samsung S10e battery level went down from 100 percent to 89 percent. That was better than the S10's 87 percent, and means you could get around ten hours of Netflix bingeing in before the battery died completely.If you really push the Samsung Galaxy S10e to its limits in terms of playing videos, blasting loud music, and firing up GPS mapping every ten minutes, then you probably will have to start hunting for a charger before bedtime; but for day-to-day use this isn't going to have you worried about where the next charge is coming from.Fast charging and wireless charging are both supported on the S10e, and Samsung has included reversible wireless charging too, so you can drop smaller gadgets on top of the phone to juice them up – it's something you might have thought would get cut from a more affordable model, but we're glad that it's been retained.Samsung Galaxy S10eWhen it comes to audio performance, we found podcasts, music, and dialog from movies and TV shows came across really clearly, even at lower levels – this isn't a phone you're going to have a problem hearing, and the stereo speakers no doubt help here.If you're looking to crank up the volume with some music or a podcast while you're doing the daily chores or getting ready in the morning, again the Samsung Galaxy S10e fits the bill nicely: ramp the volume up to the maximum and it can easily fill a room with sound. It's not the best audio we've ever heard from a phone but it's more than adequate.As with the other S10 models that Samsung has pushed out this year, the 3.5mm headphone jack gets retained, which means you can carry on using your existing wired headphones if you want to.Samsung Galaxy S10eThe Samsung Galaxy S10e comes running Android 9 Pie out of the box which means you can take advantage of all that Google's latest mobile OS has to offer – digital wellbeing tools, better notification management, improved battery management and so on.With Android Q already in testing, Android 9 Pie won't be the latest OS for much longer, so you will be relying on Samsung to push out the next update fairly swiftly if you want to stay up to date. The good news is that the redesigned One UI that Samsung now applies on top of Android is a pleasure to use.After years of trying to get the balance right between functionality and flair, Samsung's latest stab at an Android overlay manages to hit the sweet spot. It adds some extra features on top of Android (like a high-performance gaming mode and a video enhancer) without becoming too cluttered or busy.Samsung Galaxy S10eOne of the best new features in One UI is the way the menus extend towards the bottom of the screen, making one-handed operation much easier. It's not as important on the 5.8-inch screen of the Galaxy S10e, but it's still useful.Something else it has that standard stock Android doesn't have (yet) is a proper dark mode, which works across all of Samsung's included apps (the calendar, calculator, email app and so on). These bundled apps vary in terms of quality but it's easy enough to ignore them or swap them out for the Google equivalents.As for security, besides the usual PIN and pattern unlock methods, there's a capacitive fingerprint sensor built into the power button on the side, which we found quick and easy to use. At this point we think it's a better bet than in-screen fingerprint sensors (which can be hit and miss), though obviously it might be less convenient if you're left handed.Samsung Galaxy S10eLet's get down to brass tacks: the Samsung Galaxy S10e looks like a premium device, feels like a premium device, and has premium-level internal components packed inside. It's compact, powerful, and very appealing... so why would you pay more? Because you like a larger screen, perhaps, or you want the best camera money can buy.Why would you pay less and get the S10e? Because you prefer smaller screens, maybe, or because you don't think the extra screen real estate and camera capabilities of the S10 and S10 Plus are worth the extra cash. There's no objective way of rating the S10e against the other phones in the range – it's a question of personal preference.What we can tell you is we loved our time with the Samsung S10e: it's a brilliant little phone with a lot of nice touches and a mobile OS that Samsung doesn't have to be embarrassed about any more. It's still an expensive phone of course, but not quite as expensive as the high-end flagships.When you weigh it up against the other phones we've seen and are likely to see during the course of 2019, it certainly holds its own in terms of performance and design, and won't let you down with battery life, software, or camera quality either. If you're after a compact phone this year, this could well be your best option.Many thanks to Vodafone for supplying a device for review.

62,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus review: the very definition of feature-packed,"Dimensions: 157.6 x 74.1 x 7.8mmWeight: 175 gScreen: 6.4-inch AMOLED, 1440 x 3040 at 522 ppiCPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 / Exynos 9820RAM: 8GB / 12GBStorage: 128GB / 256GB / 1TB – up to 1TB via MicroSD cardBattery: 4,100mAhCameras: 12MP main + 12MP telephoto + 16MP ultra-wide / 10MP selfieOS: OneUI / Android 9.0 PieSamsung Galaxy S10 Plus is the most expensive of the all-new Galaxy S10 range. Like previous Plus entries in the Galaxy S series it has a larger screen, better camera, and higher price tag.It supplants the Galaxy S9 Plus, which we heralded as the “best phone Samsung offers” in our review last year, and brings a glut of new features including an Infinity-O display, ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, rear-mounted triple-camera, and wireless power-sharing, to name a few.And, the great news for phone lovers is that the Galaxy S10 Plus is being discounted right now by various retailers as part of the Cyber Monday 2019 sales. Be sure to check out the deals going, as the phone is now much cheaper than it was at launch.The Galaxy S10 Plus is brimming with new features. And has a price tag to match. Samsung’s productivity-focused Galaxy Note 9 made waves when it launched in August last year with a £999 sticker price, but that's nothing compared to the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. Although the Galaxy S10 Plus starts at a comparatively reasonable £899 price for the 128GB model, that rises to £1,099 for 512GB, and spirals to an eye-watering £1,399 for the maxed-out model with 12GB of RAM and 1TB of built-in storage. The latter, which can be combined with a 512GB MicroSD card so you’re carrying more storage in your pocket than most high-end laptops, is referred to as the ""Ultimate Performance Edition"" by Samsung which seems like a fitting description for a smartphone with such beefy specs.So, is it worth it? Read our in-depth Galaxy S10 review to find out …The Galaxy S10 Plus marks the tenth anniversary of the hugely-successful Galaxy S. Since the launch of the Galaxy S in June 2010, Samsung has moved from a 4-inch AMOLED display, plastic case, and 5MP rear camera to a 6.4-inch curved AMOLED with an embedded fingerprint scanner, glass and aluminium case, rear-mounted triple-camera and dual-selfie cameras.Appropriately, the Galaxy S10 Plus feels like a culmination of everything Samsung has achieved over the last decade. Unlike the Samsung Galaxy Fold, which looks like the first, tentative step in the next decade of innovation, the Galaxy S10 Plus feels more predictable, but more refined.If you’ve owned any Samsung flagship phone launched since the Galaxy S6 Edge in March 2015 then you’ll know what to expect with the Galaxy S10. The hardware feels incredibly well-built. The curvaceous front and back glass feels solid in the hand and while the aluminium band doesn’t have quite the same premium heft as the stainless steel on the similarly-priced iPhone XS, that’s a tiny nitpick in an otherwise outstanding piece of hardware. Although Google Pixel handsets price-match the Galaxy range, they can’t hold a candle to Samsung in terms of build quality.The first thing you notice about the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is the expansive 6.4-inch Quad HD+ AMOLED display. Although there is a small bezel around the display, it really feels like the screen fills every available corner of the handset.The 6.4-inch panel isn’t too much of a step-up from the 6.2-inch screen on the Galaxy S9 Plus, but does mean the Galaxy S10 Plus matches the Note 9. Until now, Samsung has always used its Galaxy Note series to offer customers more screen real estate in the name of productivity, so the Galaxy S10 marks an intriguing shift for the South Korean company.Size aside, the OLED panel on the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is absolutely stunning. It’s bright, with gorgeous colours and cavernous blacks. It’s a genuine joy to behold. It’s a delight to gorge on a boxset during your commute on that astonishing screen.Samsung offers two settings for the display – Vivid and Natural. The latter is the default and is a little more subdued than some of the previous entries in the Galaxy S series. As the name suggests, setting the display to Vivid cranks up everything until the colours are zingy and oversaturated. It’s an acquired taste, and we’d firmly recommend turning it off.The Infinity-O keeps the Galaxy S10 feeling small, despite it's massive screen size, although the design does take some getting used to ...... Samsung includes a option in the settings to disguise the cycloptic cut-out, but somehow that's just worseDespite its pocket-stretching screen size, the Galaxy S10 Plus is physically smaller than its predecessor – 157.6mm vs 158.1mm, for all you stat-hounds. Clearly, you don't need to be a member of the Magic Circle to work out the secret behind this trick is Samsung’s all-new Infinity-O display, which rehouses the front-facing selfie camera – typically found in the bezel above the screen – into a small hole-punch in the top right-hand corner of the panel. The proximity and ambient light sensors are also embedded underneath the screen.Although Samsung debuted the Infinity-O design with the mid-range Galaxy A8s, this is the first handset to use the design with a Quad HD+ AMOLED panel.When placed side by side with the Galaxy S9, it's easy to see what a difference the new Infinity-O design makesThe new display design does an outstanding job of making a smartphone with a 6.4-inch screen feel manageable in the hand. The dual-curved edges mean the Galaxy S10 Plus isn’t as wide as rivals like the iPhone XS Max, so typing one-handed while juggling a takeaway coffee isn’t impossible, although it does take some practice. However, the Infinity-O isn’t the prettiest design and does take some getting used to. Samsung does a pretty good job of obscuring the hole-punch camera with some aggressive shading in the top right-hand corner of its preinstalled wallpapers.However, when you’re presented with a bright white screen – like every time you launch the Messages app – the pill-shaped cut-out for the dual front-facing is a real cycloptic eyesore. It also means the battery life, WiFi, and 4G signal icons are shifted into an asymmetrical position close to the centre of the screen, which looks pretty awful.Samsung has publicly mocked rival smartphone manufacturers for including a notched display in their smartphones to house the selfie camera, speaker and sensors in an all-screen design – we’d take the design of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro or OnePlus 6T any day over the off-centre lanyard cut-out sitting at the top of the otherwise gorgeous Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.What the dual selfie cameras on the new Samsung flagship lack in beauty, they more than make up for with functionality. The Galaxy S10 Plus, which is the only model in the S10 range with dual front-facing cameras, is the only device capable of shooting Live Focus selfies. These photographs add an adjustable, artificial bokeh-style blur to the background behind the subject.While this is commonplace on almost all flagship smartphones, Samsung has added a number of extra effects to its Live Focus feature this year. “Colour Point” turns the background greyscale so that only the subject is left in colour, while “Zoom Bokeh” and “Spin Bokeh” make it look like you’re racing towards the camera or speeding around on a roundabout, respectively.“Colour Point” is easily our favourite and produces some really nice shots – even with our admittedly clumsy selfie skills. “Zoom Bokeh” and “Spin Bokeh” could make for a fun Instagram post, but won’t be anything we’ll be going back to after an initial snap.""Colour Point"" uses the depth-map captured by the camera to highlight the subject of the image in colour, while blending bokeh-style blur and greyscale in the backgroundSamsung deserves some praise for trying something completely original and not blindly copying the Portrait Lighting feature introduced with the iPhone XS as so many Android manufacturers have done (here's looking at you OnePlus and Honor). The new Live Focus modes produce usable shots more reliably than Portrait Lighting, too.And if wacky effects and bokeh aren’t your bag, you’ll be pleased to know the standard selfies on the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus camera look great. While the photos aren’t quite as sharp and detail-packed as those shot on the rival Google Pixel 3, we don’t necessarily feel the need to see each individual hair and pore – so are perfectly happy with the results from the Galaxy S10 Plus.Flip over the Galaxy S10 Plus and you’ll find the new triple-camera. This new rear-mounted system includes a 12MP wide-angle camera with Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) and a variable aperture that can switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4. It’s the same system introduced with the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus last year and still works just as well. Although the variable aperture on the S10 Plus doesn’t work quite as well as the latest software solutions, like Night Sight on the Google Pixel 3 which picks out details and colours barely visible with the human eye in darkness.Alongside the main camera, you’ll find a 16MP f/2.2 ultra-wide sensor and a 12MP telephoto lens with f/2.4. Using the new triple-camera, Samsung has enabled 0.5x wide-angle shots, the same as those seen on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, as well as 2x optical zoom. Both new modes are a cinch to access thanks to a small pop-up that appears in the default camera mode (tap the icon of the forest to zoom out, and the icon of the leaf to zoom-in). While Samsung once had an – admittedly, well-earned – reputation for saddling its smartphones with gimmicky features that you'd never use after the demo on the shop floor, but these new additions are genuinely useful.Shooting a high-rise with the wide-angle camera on the Galaxy S10 Plus is a pretty standard affair ...... but flip over to the ultra-wide angle camera and you get something genuinely specialIn particular the ultra-wide can produce some really striking photos. The 0.5x zoom is also incredibly useful when trying to take photographs of skyscrapers and architecture that would normally require you to retreat to the other side of the road to fit into the viewfinder. The 2x optical zoom is likely to be popular with those who take photos at concerts and want to give the impression they were in the front row, whilst simultaneously avoiding the squeeze.However, with Huawei pushing the boundaries with the 3x optical zoom on its P20 Pro and Oppo revealing early prototypes of smartphones with 10x optical zoom … it’s starting to feel a little outdated.Those who are worried that Samsung has neglected to add any superfluous features into the Galaxy S10 Plus – don’t panic! The all-new Shot Suggestions feature is a gimmicky new addition that uses AI to suggest the best composition for whatever you’re lining up in the viewfinder. Samsung adds a spirit-level line that cuts across the entire screen, which is pretty useful, but there’s also a dot that Samsung believes should be in the centre of the shot. Samsung says it has analysed 100 million high-quality photos to create the rules used by Shot Suggestions, but it seemed to basically boil down to the simple rule-of-thirds and always wanting Wes Anderson-esque straight angles everywhere. Thankfully, it’s not switched on by default.With the Galaxy S10 Plus, Samsung has finally ditched the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, which will be music to the ears of anyone still using the Galaxy S8 Plus and its teeth-grindingly finicky sensor placed beside the camera lens. Instead, the biometric sensor is now found underneath the AMOLED display. We have always preferred front-facing fingerprint scanners – not least because it means you can unlock the phone and authenticate secure apps when the handset is resting on your desk or charging without having to pick it up.Unlike the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and OnePlus 6T, which use an optical in-display fingerprint scanner, Samsung has opted for an ultrasonic sensor – the first to do in a smartphone. The Seoul-based company claims its ultrasonic scanner is more reliable than rival solutions since it uses soundwaves instead of light, which means it can continue to work in tough weather conditions, including heavy rain. Samsung says it’s more secure than optical scanners since it’s capable of recording every single ridge on your fingertip.While we can’t vouch for exactly how many of the ridges in our fingerprint the ultrasonic scanner managed to record, Samsung’s claims about the ultrasonic sensor working in a downfall is absolutely not hyperbole. Unlike previous Galaxy S handsets, the fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S10 doesn’t even break a sweat when the glass is wet, meaning you’ll be able to unlock the handset when you’re in the middle of the washing-up, working out in the gym, or clammy handed walking to a job interview without issue.If you're paying attention, it can be easy to miss the exact spot on the screen – much easier than traditional physical sensorsThat’s not to say the ultrasonic scanner is infallible though. Samsung highlights the area of the screen above the sensor with a fingerprint icon. However, you have to be fairly precise with the placement of your digit.Absent-mindedly pulling out the phone and trying to unlock it while navigating pavements bustling with weekend shoppers lead to the phone telling us to “cover the entire fingerprint sensor” a fair few times.Overall, we’ve been impressed with the new ultrasonic and prefer it to the small physical sensors nestled next to the cameras on the last two generations of Galaxy S smartphones.The Galaxy S10 Plus runs the phenomenal, Samsung-designed One UI mobile operating system, which is based on Android 9.0 Pie. In the past, the words “phenomenal” and “Samsung-designed mobile operating system” would never have been found in the same sentence – but the South Korean company has really pulled it out of the bag with its latest reimagining of Android.The new mobile software acknowledges that while we all want massive screens on our smartphones, massive smartphones are annoying to use, especially one-handed while walking or squished into the carriage of a train a morning commute. To solve the headache of using an expansive 6.4-inch display, One UI shifts all the elements of the user interface that you’ll actually need to tap into the lower-third of the touchscreen where they are within easy reach.It’s a bit like the Reachability feature that Apple introduced a few years back, which temporarily drops the entire screen into the lower-half of the display, but applied across an entire user interface. Even swiping on the notification shade drops the quick action toggles far enough down the display that you won’t need to perform thumb-gymnastics to hit the right icon.Samsung fills the top of the display with comically-large menu titles. When you first pick up the Galaxy S10 Plus, it looks very odd. But as soon as you start using the 6.4-inch smartphone, it all makes sense. For those accustomed to the TouchWiz operating system that powered older Galaxy S handsets, One UI is going to take some serious getting used to. But it’s worth it.One UI has some seriously big titles at the top of the screen, but it keeps everything reachable ... or just aboutNot everything about One UI is perfect. Some of the default Samsung application icons are a little gaudy, and there are still some duplicates between Samsung and Google apps – why do I need two stores and two calendars? There’s also a question mark over whether Samsung will keep One UI updated as quickly as rivals like Motorola and OnePlus, which just about keep pace with Google and its Pixel-branded smartphone when it comes to Android OS updates and security patches. Until now, Samsung has always dragged its feet, but fingers crossed that changes with its new-look software.Fuelling the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is a 4,100mAh battery cell. For comparison, that’s bigger than the battery in the Galaxy Note 9, despite its larger footprint. In our time with the Galaxy S10 Plus that mammoth battery was more than enough to keep the device powering through a full-day of heavy usage. With some restraint, it’s easy to eke out a day and a half between charges.That extra battery comes in handy thanks to a new feature called Wireless PowerShare that allows owners to top-up any device capable of wireless charging using the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. The new feature is enabled in the settings, then you simply flip over the phone and place any Qi-compatible gadget on the case to start charging. If that sounds at all familiar, it’s probably because Huawei first introduced this feature with the Mate 20 Pro last year. Wireless PowerShare on the Galaxy S10 Plus is a little finicky to find the exact spot on the uniform glass case to activate the charge, but after a few tries we got pretty good at locating it.Granted, Wireless PowerShare is not going to be the feature that pushes you to upgrade from an older Galaxy S model, but it’s a handy addition and means you can help-out a friend in need who has forgotten to pack an external battery pack and USB charging cable on a night-out. It also works phenomenally well with the Galaxy Buds – the new AirPod rivalling Gear IconX successors announced alongside the S10. You can place these on the back of the Galaxy S10 Plus while it’s on charge to refuel both gadgets with a single USB-C cable – useful it you want to travel light.Contrary to the rumours in the months ahead of the launch of the Galaxy S10 Plus, the 3.5mm headphone port remains intact so there’s no need to throw-out your wired cans or cough-up for a 3.5mm-to-USB-C dongle. Like its predecessor, the Galaxy S10 Plus is rated IP68 for water and dust resistance, which means it’ll withstand a swim in 1.5metres of water for half an hour.If you’re looking for the biggest, fastest, feature-packed Samsung Galaxy smartphone available right now, this is it. At least, until the Galaxy S10 5G and Galaxy Fold launch in a few months.The Galaxy S10 Plus boasts the same premium build quality and stunning fit-and-finish we've come to expect from Samsung, but now sports a bigger display, bigger battery and faster internals. There’s also new camera features you won’t find on anywhere else in the Galaxy S10 range and while some are undeniably gimmicky, others are decidedly not.If you’re looking for the ultimate Samsung Galaxy S10, look no further. But if you’ve never been a fan of mammoth smartphone displays, the new Infinity-O display and new One UI software tweak probably aren’t enough to convince you to reconsider.• Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus launched worldwide March 8, 2019. Prices start from £899. Galaxy S10 Plus ships in Prism White, Prism Black, Prism Green, Prism Blue, Ceramic White, and Ceramic BlackSince we published our Galaxy S10 Plus review, some new details about the Samsung handset have emerged. We'll keep you posted about all of the latest updates here, in case they change how you feel about the handset...27 March 2019: First up, Samsung has confirmed that Galaxy S10 owners who don't specifically tick the option to enrol their device in the company's Samsung Premium Care scheme when they check-out online cannot sign-up after the fact.This baffling quirk also occurred in the months following the launch of the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus last year, with those who hadn't immediately opted-in during the check-out process left unable to register until September. Fingers crossed Samsung doesn't leave it quite that long this time around. For those who don't know, Samsung Premium Care is an upgraded warranty scheme that provides accidental damage protection for your Galaxy flagship, similar to AppleCare+.In the meantime, we'd recommend getting a case. Or being very careful when using your Galaxy S10 Plus as repairs for this all-glass flagship can be mightily expensive.1 April 2019: Samsung's second over-the-air software update for the Galaxy S10 phones – the March 2019 update – brought with it improvements to Wireless PowerShare and camera stability. As a result of the update, The heart rate sensor on the rear of the Galaxy S10 Plus (and the Galaxy S10) will light up to indicate that Wireless PowerShare is being used.According to SamMobile, when you enable Wireless PowerShare, you’ll see a blinking blue light which turns red when you you place another device against the phone and wireless charging begins. When the device you’re charging reaches full charge,the light will go dark. If you want to install the update manually rather than wait for it to arrive, go to 'Settings', 'Software update' and tap 'Download updates manually'.3 April 2019: Google Duplex is now rolling out to Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus users in the US. Previously only available on the Pixel 3, and even then only in four cities, Google has said that Duplex will become available in 47 states and on other Android and iOS devices, and XDA Developers has confirmed that it is now rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.Google Duplex is the slightly creepy service Google showed off at its Google IO developer conference in May 2018. Part of Google Assistant, Duplex can call restaurants, hairdressers and other businesses to make appointments on your behalf so you don't actually have to speak to a human until you arrive for your appointment.23 April 2019: The latest Galaxy S10 Plus update improves Wi-Fi stability. According to Tizen Help a 205.18MB update with the firmware version of G975FXXU1ASD5 / G975FOXM1ASD4 / G975FXXU1ASD4 is now rolling out. As well as improving Wi-Fi stability, the software patch also brings a dedicated night mode option to the camera app so users can launch the mode manually whereas previously it would only launch automatically in low light situations. The update should arrive automatically as it rolls out,  but it can also be found in Settings > Software update.29 April 2019: The April Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus update may have also improved the S10 Plus' battery life. The improvement was noticed by a writer at Sammobile, who says his S10 Plus has gained about an extra hour of time between charges. Although the writer hasn't been able to pinpoint the reason for this improvement he notes that ""I’m pretty sure it’s not a coincidence that my S10+ is lasting longer after the most recent software update"".17 May 2019: Samsung has launched a Samsung Galaxy S10+ Olympic Game Edition to commemorate the 2020 Summer Olympics which take place in Tokyo. The handset features a Tokyo 2020 logo on the back, while a similar design appears on an Olympic Game Edition pair of Galaxy Buds, which come with the phone. This special edition S10+ ican be ordered in Japan now from Docomo for $1,000. According to GSMArena there are only 10,000  units of this special edition handset being produced and it’s not clear if this model will be available outside of Japan.17 May 2019: It seems that while Galaxy phones outside of the US have received the night mode update, it has not yet made it to US carrier-locked handsets. Sammobile notes that Sprint is the first to release the May patch which features a security update and dozens of bugs fixes but not the night mode at this time. Sammobile says that with this monthly patch cycle complete it could be another month before night mode makes it to US Galaxy handsets.21 May 2019: Samsung is readying a new 'Cardinal Red' version of the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, according to The Verge. It's not known when the new colour will go on sale or in which countries. If accurate, this would bring the number of available S10 colours up to 10. Apparently the new colour is also coming to the Samsung Galaxy S10, while it's not known if it will make it to the budget Samsung Galaxy S10e.14 August 2019: Samsung is back on track with its pledge to roll-out software updates faster to its new One UI-touting handsets. The entire Galaxy S10 line-up has been updated across a number of European markets with the latest security patches today. The Seoul-based company pushed-out its July update much slower than average, despite the update not including any new features or design tweaks.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review
63,Samsung Galaxy S10,Samsung Galaxy S10 review: the complete package,"Dimensions: 149.9 x 70.4 x 7.8 mmWeight: 157 gScreen: 6.1-inch, 19:9, 550 ppi (1,440 x 3,040)CPU: Exynos 9820RAM: 8GBStorage: 128-512GBBattery: 3,400mAhCameras: 12MP+12MP+16MP rear / 10MP frontOS: Android 9.0 Pie, One UIEvery year we see a whole host of new Android flagships hit the market – phones from everyone from Huawei to Google to OnePlus – but for many the Samsung Galaxy phones are the ones to beat, and this year it's the Galaxy S10 leading the charge.This is smaller and cheaper than the Galaxy S10 Plus, and larger and more expensive than the Galaxy S10e – so does that mean it hits the perfect sweet spot of power and price? Or does it fall awkwardly between the other two options in the range?There's good news for deal hunters looking to pick up this phone, as the 2019 Cyber Monday deals spectacular has seen retailers slash the prices on this phone both on contract and SIM free.There's also a Samsung Galaxy S10 5G version, which changes up some of the specs.Here we're going to focus on the Samsung Galaxy S10, set to be one of the most loved and most popular phones of the year. Does it have what it takes to hold off its competitors and claim the title of the best phone of 2019? This is what we thought of the phone after putting it through its paces for several days.The Samsung Galaxy S10 is available right now to buy in the UK in your choice of white, black, and green – enough colour choice if you decide to opt for this over the Galaxy S10 Plus and the Galaxy S10e.Go direct to Samsung and you'll pay £799 for the version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Pony up £999 instead and that'll get you the same 8GB of RAM with 512GB of storage. Those are up front prices for SIM-free phones.Head to Carphone Warehouse and you can pick up a Samsung Galaxy S10 from £39.99 per month with a £99.99 up front payment – that's with 1GB of data a month, and for the 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage model.At this point it's been fairly well established that Samsung is capable of making some fantastic-looking smartphones, and the Galaxy S10 is by no means a disappointment in this regard. It oozes style and class from every glass and metal pore, and feels like a luxury product from the moment you pick it up.Samsung's experimentation with the notch continues with a hole-punch cut-out in the top right-hand corner, known as an ""Infinity-O"" display in Samsung parlance. We prefer a thicker bezel rather than any notch, but it's really a matter of personal preference.What can't be argued is the quality of the craftsmanship here – Samsung has once again excelled itself in the way it's managed to put together its flagship smartphone. The new all-screen design pushes the display to the very edge of the handset, leaving almost no bezels whatsoever.The bezels are much smaller this year, but the front-facing camera is much, much more noticeableThe combination of the Infinity-O design and software tweaks means the 6.1-inch screen on the Galaxy S10 is easier to use and more comfortable to handle and than the 5.8-inch display on its predecessor, despite the Galaxy S10 standing a fraction more than 2mm taller than the S9 too.In fact, it's one of the most compact phones with a screen bigger than 6 inches that we've ever had the pleasure to handle. A whopping 93.1 percent of the front of the phone is taken up with the screen. IP68 waterproofing is here too for peace of mind.If we were being picky we'd say that the layout and the bulge of the triple-lens camera on the back of the unit isn't the most elegant of solutions, but we really are struggling to come up with anything bad to say about the design and the build quality of the Samsung Galaxy S10. It takes what the Galaxy S9 had to offer and offers a substantial boost in aesthetics.Samsung has, once again, produced an absolutely brilliant display in the 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen that sits on the front of the Galaxy S10. With a fantastic resolution, stunning vibrancy, and rich contrast, it's undoubtedly one of the best screens we've ever seen on a smartphone. It even makes looking at your emails a pleasure.You can ramp the brightness way, way up, which hurts battery life but can help in daylight. Viewing angles are excellent too, while the edge-to-edge screen and rounded sides of the display help to add to the immersive feel.The HDR10+ support helps to boost contrast and colour on the fly, and if you fire up something like Netflix or YouTube then the sharp resolution and rich HDR quality really do shine through. You might even decide to start watching more videos on your phone just to enjoy what the display has to offer – it's that good.As with previous entries in the Galaxy S series, handsets sold in the United States and China are powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor – the Snapdragon 855 in this case. Those on shelves in Europe and South Korea have Samsung's own Exynos silicon under the bonnet, and so if you buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 in the UK, it will be powered by the Samsung Exynos 9820.That's coupled with an ample 8GB of RAM, and in use the Galaxy S10 feels slick and lightning-fast, no matter what the task. Switching between apps is near instant, with even graphics-intensive games firing up in seconds. You'll struggle to find a better-performing Android phone in 2019, and the benchmarks we ran backed that up.We loaded up as many different apps as we could and played a few laps of Asphalt 8, and the Samsung Galaxy S10 coped without breaking a sweat (or a hint of extra heat). Android phones can have a problem with lag, but we wouldn't expect the Galaxy S10 to be one of them, even after a few years of use.From scrolling through long websites to editing photos, the Galaxy S10 runs at a very speedy clip, which can of course be very useful when you're trying to track down a nearby restaurant or fire up the camera.The question is whether the extra money you'll pay over a mid-range phone is worth the extra performance you're going to be able to get from the Galaxy S10. After a few days of use, we'd say so – though of course you have to make your own judgement call on that. The RAM and processor packed in here are certainly more than capable of coping with everything a phone needs to do in 2019.[CPU test]Single-core: 4,502Multi-core: 10,347[Compute test]Compute score: 10,182[Battery test]Battery score estimate: 2,631Storage options range from 128-512GB on the Galaxy S10If you want the very best performance a smartphone can offer in 2019, and you're prepared to spend money to get it, then the Samsung Galaxy S10 definitely fits the bill. If you're more of a lightweight phone user, you probably don't need all of the power the Galaxy S10 offers up.Samsung phones have earned a strong reputation in the camera department over the last few years, but the jumps in quality and innovation have been getting smaller each year. It's the same story with the S10, which offers a noticeable but not huge improvement over what we saw with the S9.That's not a problem, as the Galaxy S9 had a great camera, but it's fair to say phones like the Google Pixel 3 and iPhone XS have now caught up to Samsung in the photo-taking department.What we do have is an extra sensor: last year, Samsung introduced a secondary sensor, and with the Galaxy S10, the number of rear-mounted sensors increases again, bringing the total to three.This triple-lens system comprises a 12-megapixel camera with Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) and a variable aperture that can switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4, as well as a new 16-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide sensor and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens with f/2.4.This enables 0.5x wide-angle shots (as seen on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro), as well as 2x optical zoom. Both modes are really easy to access with a single tap on a small pop-up that appears in the default camera mode – these new additions feel genuinely useful.From tourist shots of ancient architecture and towering skyscrapers, the 0.5x zoom means you won't have to keep retreating away from the subject to get the ideal shot, and the 2x optical zoom is likely to be popular with those who take photos at concerts and want to give the impression they were in the front row, whilst simultaneously avoiding the squeeze. In both cases, photo quality seems to be retained very well.Other new features are more forgettable, like the Live Focus that can adds an artificial bokeh-style blur, a partial greyscale filter, or a swirling blur to the background behind your chosen subject. Fun, but not really essential.As with its predecessors, the Galaxy S10 is capable of taking some really nice smartphone shots, rich in colour and contrast, and well balanced in terms of darker and lighter areas. A scene needs to get seriously underlit before the rear camera on the S10 starts to struggle, and even then you can often come away with something usable.The supplied camera app comes packing some optimisations and processing features that we weren't particularly impressed with: it did take us several goes to work out how to take portrait and night shots properly, but perhaps that's more our fault than Samsung's.If you need a smartphone camera that's going to give you great results almost every time just by pointing and shooting, the Galaxy S10 passes with flying colours. If you need to dig deeper and take more control over your shots, the Galaxy S10 can do that too.It's not a perfect camera system though, and doesn't really raise the bar for phone photos – it just keeps it at a very high level. We'd say even with a single lens, the Pixel 3 phones have the edge, especially in low light shots, for the time being.Selfies from the 10MP front-facing camera are good – better than good, in fact. Whether you're using the front or the back camera, focus is grabbed in a snap, and photos are taken in an instant.Choose to buy the Samsung Galaxy S10 and you're going to get snaps that are an upgrade on the photos taken with almost every other camera out there, even if it's not quite at the top of the ladder. Add in all the photo modes and extra tricks on board, and it's another big tick in the positives column for the phone.Battery life is a crucial consideration for every smartphone purchase, with just about a day's use possible from a full charge on most modern-day smartphones. The Galaxy S10 doesn't really vary from that, with a 3,400mAh battery packed in.That's a decent-sized battery, but the S10 has a bright, big, high-resolution screen, which takes its toll on battery life. In our standard battery test – an hour of Netflix on maximum brightness and 50 percent volume – the S10 dropped from 100 percent to 87 percent.That's fine, but not game-changing, and it's worse than (for example) the Xiaomi Mi 9 – but then the Mi 9 doesn't have such a quality display, so it's all about compromises. If eight hours of constant Netflixing between charges is enough for you, the S10 will do just fine.According to Samsung, one of the biggest improvements to the Exynos 9820 is power efficiency, which has been improved 40 percent over the predecessor that powered the Galaxy S9. We never got to the evening worrying about battery life dying before bedtime, but it's possible that with particularly heavy usage you might need a top-up.Bear in mind that we were testing a brand new phone, so battery life is likely to degrade over time. The bottom line is that despite the increase in battery capacity over the Galaxy S9, you're not going to be able to change your charging habits with this.What you do get is wireless charging and fast charging, as with previous Samsung Galaxy phones. The Galaxy S10 can get a full recharge in as little as an hour and a half using the bundled, wired charger, and you've got the option of wireless too. Reversible wireless charging is supported as well, so you can juice up other devices on the back of the S10 (provided you have 30 percent or more charge left on your phone at the time).The Samsung Galaxy S10 features reverse wireless charging techWe were definitely impressed with the stereo speakers on the Galaxy S10. No smartphone is going to be able to compete with a Sonos speaker or Apple HomePod for filling a room with high-fidelity audio, but the S10 is perfectly fine for the odd tune, regular podcast listening, and movie dialog – even at high volumes.Having watched a few television show episodes on the Galaxy S10, we came away very satisfied with the audio performance. Just be careful where you put your hands when watching, as the speakers are easily muted. As an added bonus, the S10 keeps the 3.5 mm headphone jack as well.Samsung recently revamped its Android software under the new label One UI, and we like it a lot: powered by Android 9 Pie, the new software acknowledges that massive smartphone screens can be tough to use, especially one-handed while walking or squished into the carriage of a train.With that in mind, it sensibly shifts all the interactive elements of the user interface into the lower-third of the screen where they're within easy reach. The phone is already a compact one considering its 6.1-inch screen, and the One UI interface really helps.It's not quite the best take on Android we've ever seen (hello OnePlus), and it won't necessarily get updates as fast as other handsets (hello Pixels), but it's an improvement over Samsung's previous attempts to build on top of Google's source code.Admittedly the bundled apps aren't particularly great, but they're easily replaced by Google's own – even down to the digital assistant (Google Assistant vs Bixby). Menus are clearer and easier to get around, and you've got more layout and theme customisation options than you get with stock Android.For security, the biometric sensor has been relocated to underneath the edge-to-edge screen on the front of the handset. Samsung says this sensor is much more reliable than solutions from competitors since it records every single ridge in your print, and it should work in a variety of tough weather conditions.It's actually a breeze to set up and worked well in our tests, though it's not quite as responsive as the fingerprint sensors we're all used to – that goes for speed as well as reliability.We wouldn't say it's a major issue but you might have to have a second attempt at unlocking maybe one time in five. Whether that's worth the convenience of having a sensor on the front and not having to get your face into view is your call – but we do prefer a fingerprint unlock to a face one.This tech is going to get better over time but we found it perfectly usable (and better than the in-screen fingerprint sensors we tested last year). You do still need a relatively firm press for the time being.The Galaxy S10 is available in a 4G and 5G variantFor the 10th anniversary of its iconic Galaxy S smartphone range, Samsung has added some genuinely useful improvements and refined just about everything on its flagship phone. It's easily the best smartphone that Samsung has ever built, and is going to take some beating in 2019.Granted, we've seen many of these features before – the Infinity-O design (debuting on the Galaxy A8s), the fingerprint scanner (the OnePlus 6T), the reversible charging (Huawei Mate 20 Pro), but everything feels a little more polished and less gimmicky here.If we're being picky then some areas are very good rather than best-in-class – battery life and low-light camera performance among them – but it's difficult to think of another smartphone that gets so much right in such a brilliant all-round package.The screen, design, and performance are all truly top notch, and with One UI Samsung has an operating system it can be a lot more proud of (though you might still be waiting a while for future updates to roll out).For the time being at least, the biggest rivals to the Samsung Galaxy S10 are the Galaxy S10 Plus and the Galaxy S10e: you can spend a little more for a bigger phone or a little less for a more compact one. For a lot of people though, we think the Galaxy S10 will be the perfect mix of features, performance, and price.Is it the best Android phone you can buy at the moment? Well, no. That honour goes to its bigger brother, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. If, though, you prefer more modest sized handsets, then the Galaxy S10 will be an absolute top tier choice.Since we published our Samsung Galaxy S10 review, new details about the Samsung handset have emerged. We'll keep you posted about the latest updates below to help you make the best buying decision...23 April 2019: A new Samsung Galaxy S10 update which brings a dedicated night mode option to the camera app is now rolling out. The update means that S10 owners can now launch the mode manually; previously it would only launch automatically in low light scenarios. The update also improves Wi-Fi stability. According to Tizen Help it's a 205.81MB update with the firmware version of G973FXXU1ASD5 / G973FOXM1ASD4 / G973FXXU1ASD4. Users who don't want to wait for the update to arrive automatically,  can get their S10 to download it in Settings > Software update.25 April 2019: While the SIM-free price of the Galaxy S10 remains at £799 right now new, Mobiles.co.uk has a very attractive with-contract offers that allow you to pick the phone up for as low as £125 upfront. That modest upfront outlay then bags you a 128GB Samsung Galaxy S10 in your colour of choice, along with a contract that delivers a whopping 30GB of data per month, as well as unlimited minutes and texts for £37 per month. Total cost of that deal over the two years is £1013. For Samsung's latest flagship phone, which has only been on the market a month or so and received a perfect 5-star score from us on review, we think that is a great package.29 April 2019: Samsung Galaxy S10 owners can now view their phone's notifications on their PC. This isn't a Samsung update; it was introduced for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S9 by Microsoft and now, according to Sammobile, which also explains how the function works, it has now been rolled out to the Samsung Galaxy S10 (and the Note 8 and Note 9).17 May 2019: A new firmware patch that is rolling out for carrier-locked Galaxy S10 phones in the US brings the security patch for May but does not include the night mode option which has been arriving on phones outside of the US, Sammobile notes. Sprint is the first to release the patch and it appears that it only contains the security update, so US users will have to wait a little longer for the night mode.21 May 2019: Apparently, the Samsung Galaxy S10 (and the Galaxy S10 Plus) will become available in a 'Cardinal Red' finish. Sammobile has discovered renders of the new handset but notes that it is unclear when this new colour will go on sale and in which markets it will be available. If this new colour finish does become available, it will bring the number of colours up to 10.Many thanks to Vodafone for supplying a device for review. Vodafone's full Samsung Galaxy S10 range can be viewed on its official website.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-review
64,Apple iPhone 11,Apple iPhone 11 review: a near-perfect balance of price and features,"Welcome to T3’s iPhone 11 review, taking a look at the iPhone you’ll probably buy this year.We’ve already posted our iPhone 11 Pro review, which rated Apple’s most technically advanced phone of the year.Now we’ve got its little sibling, which sells for a whopping £300 less, yet only really feels cut back in minor ways. You’ve a top-tier dual-lens camera, lush 6.1-inch screen, sleek glass and metal design, next-gen Face ID security, the most powerful phone processor on the planet and big battery life… it’s a seriously great package.And despite this being a great all-round package, iPhone 11 deals really aren't too expensive and are now seemingly dropping in price.The iPhone 11 starts from £729 – a full £320 less than the £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro. That’s for a 64GB model, which is the same capacity as the Pro models come with.You can upgrade to 128GB of storage for £50 more, and we would absolutely recommend that. 64GB is actually find for most people, but that upgrade price is so meagre (especially if spread out over monthly payments) that it seems like a slam dunk to us.There’s also a 256GB option for £879, if you want even more space. Apple continues to avoid putting microSD card slots in its phones, so whatever amount you choose is what you’re stuck with.The iPhone 11 comes in six colours, lots of which are new. There are black, white and red tones, which are familiar from the iPhone XR range that this sort of replaces (the XR is still around, but is now cheaper).The new colours are yellow, green and purple. These last three are actually all a bit paler than it seems on the Apple website – because the back is glass, the colours can really turn pastel in the light. The purple in particular is much more of a light lilac.It’s a great range of shades, though – we’re just glad so many companies are embracing phone design outside of black and off-white.Apple says the iPhone 11 models have the “toughest glass ever in a smartphone”, which you’ll find on the back and front. Unlike the iPhone 11 Pro, there’s no etched pattern on the rear glass, so it’s totally smooth.The sides of the iPhone 11 are aluminium, compared to stainless steel in the 11 Pro – that’s the kind of cost-saving we can definitely live with.On the front, the iPhone 11 has marginally thicker bezels than the iPhone 11 Pro, but it still feels like a modern design. There is a big notch, which is slightly less up-to-date, but unless you’ve got a serious tech fetish, it’s really not something that will bother you in any way. It needs to be big to house all the tech for Apple’s Face ID system, which is more secure than in other smartphones.The fit and finish is full Apple quality – there’s no sense that any cheaping out has happened in the construction. It feels just as solid and near-seamless in the hand as the more expensive model… it’s just made from slightly less fancy materials in some areas.The screen is one of the big differences on the iPhone 11 compared to the 11 Pro. Here, you’ve got a ‘Liquid Retina’ LCD display (which is just Apple’s way of saying it’s a very nice LCD with curved corners); on the iPhone 11 Pro you’ve got high-end OLED screen.The display is 828x1792, which makes it fairly low-resolution compared to a lot of rivals, but with a pixel density of 329ppi, it’s still easily sharp enough to look great. Once you go beyond 300ppi (which the same sharpness as photos in a magazine, for example) you’re really into diminishing returns. Text is clear, photos are sharp. HD movies have a little softness to them, when compared to the 11 Pro side-by-side, but it’s small.The big limitation here is that it’s LCD, compared to OLED screens in basically all of its rivals, as well as the 11 Pro. OLED gives you better contrast between light and dark areas on the screen, and works better for displaying HDR.The iPhone 11’s screen isn’t HDR-rated at all, and has a maximum brightness of around 625 nits. The iPhone 11 Pro’s screen works with Dolby Vision (the most advanced kind of HDR) and peaks at around 1,200 nits – that’s pretty much what you expect from an OLED TV.Side by side, the difference is noticeable, especially when watching HDR movies – there’s a relative flatness to the images on the iPhone 11 compared to the 11 Pro. The colours look great, but it doesn’t have the realism and nuance that extra dynamic range of the OLED screen gives you, especially in scenes that contrast light and dark strongly.The same is actually true for HDR photos – looking at the same shot on both the 11 and 11 Pro reveals more darker detail on the 11 Pro, making everything look moodier and more dramatic. Though whether you prefer that might be more of an aesthetic thing – there’s nothing wrong with the pics you’re seeing on the iPhone 11’s screen.In other areas, the difference is minor to the point of being not really worth mentioning. Web browsing, social and other apps all look fine. Better than fine, in fact – Apple has included a wide P3 colour display that makes photos look vibrant and realistic when taken on the phone.It also includes Apple’s True Tone tech, which adjusts the colour balance depending on ambient light, making it much more comfortable to read. We can’t overstate how great this feature is – you don’t notice it until you have to use a screen that doesn’t have it, and the nasty blue hue overwhelms.Speaker of colour balance, the screen is noticeably less warm toned than the iPhone 11 Pro’s OLED display. It’s not that the whites look blue here – they definitely look white. It’s more than we noticed the whites on the 11 Pro feeling just a tad yellower.The 6.1-inch size of the display is excellent. It’s on the borderline of what I can comfortably use one-handed (I’m a fairly large man, though), but feels like it’s giving you lots of space. It’s almost a shame that this size isn’t available in the higher end models (which come in 5.8-inch or 6.5-inch only).Ultimately, the screen is great, but movie lovers would probably prefer an OLED model. You can get that from Apple’s Pro phones if you want to stick with iOS, or from any number of Android rivals – the best phone for movies is Sony’s Xperia One, if you’re that keen.Apple’s new spatial audio tech, also seen on the Pro models, is used here – it’s really impressive at creating a stereo sound that also hints at even more precise positions of 3D audio. Generally, we suspect most people who watch movies on the phone will use headphones, so it may not get to fulfil its potential that often, but the fancy speaker arrays come with a second bonus: they’ve very loud and pretty damn good.Music sound great from the iPhone 11 directly, as do podcasts. Very clear, a pretty good and rich balance, and you have to go pretty damn loud to make it start to feel harsh. They’re impressive!The iPhone 11 has a dual lens camera system, consisting of a wide-angle lens that’s pretty much the same as found on the iPhone XR last year, but now with an ultra-wide-angle lens to back it up.The ultra-wide lens is 0.5x zoom compared to the wide-angle, so it effectively lets you zoom out without having to move your feet – great for landscapes, indoor shots, groups and architecture.It’s used here for more than just extra angles here, though. It can do 3D depth sensing, meaning that the iPhone 11 has proper Portrait mode – the version of this feature on the iPhone XR was all done with software, but here it’s done with actual 3D data. This means it works on people, pets and objects (the XR’s only works on people).It also helps with the new Night mode feature, which captures extremely low-light images, and is a small revolution. Quite a few other phones have debuted with similar features, stretching back to the Google Pixel 3 last year, but Apple’s is the best implementation yet – it not only brightens images without making them noisy, but also adds loads more detail in.It’s a game-changer, especially given that it’s extremely easy to use (but you can tinker with its settings once you’re confident about using it).The image quality from the 11’s cameras is just fantastic, and is as good as you get from the iPhone 11 Pro, albeit without the third 2x telephoto lens (which does reduce flexibility somewhat). That’s the headline: the pictures are as good as £1,000 phones – and that includes Samsung as well as Apple).The rich HDR brings brilliant drama to skies, and realistic shadow and highlight contrast in sunny scenes. There’s bags of detail, but Apple does a good job of not letting processing overtake the shot – scenes look how they should, as if a high-end dedicated camera was taking the shots.On the front, you’ve got an improved selfie camera that now has a wider field of view, though you can choose how wide you want it to be: narrow for just yourself, or wider for a group.The only complaint we have at all about the iPhone 11’s cameras are that you get much more flexibility from a triple system – either one like on the 11 Pro, or especially on the Huawei P30 Pro, which is more expensive (though not by much), but gives you a 10x digital/optical hybrid zoom that’s practically full quality.The pure image quality is better from the iPhone 11, but there’s no denying that a good zoom can let you get more artistic about framing.Speaking of framing, Apple has included an optional extra trick in the iPhone 11 models that’s worth mentioning: composition correction. In the Settings app, under Camera, there’s a new switch for ‘Photos Capture Outside the Frame’.Turn it on and it will start using the ultra-wide angle camera to monitor what’s just outside the frame you shoot when you’re using the regular wide-angle. If it thinks there’s a slightly better composition to be had (for example, correcting a slightly off-straight shot, or better centering a subject), it will pull in extra pixels from the ultra-wide camera and instantly reframe the photo. You’ll never even know it did it, you just think you take a great shot. Obviously, this could override you intentions, which is why it’s an optional extra, and in any shots that have the adjustment applied, it can be removed in the Edit mode with a single tap.It’s a very clever, and potentially really useful addition for people who just want nice shots and don’t study the artistry of it.Let’s take a look at some sample images:Left: Ultra-wide lens. Right: Wide lens.Here, you can see a shot taken with both lenses, and how it changes the view. Note how similar the colours are between the two images – the lenses have been carefully calibrated so they’ll give the same results.Left: iPhone 11, wide-angle. Right: iPhone 11 Pro, telephotoHere’s the difference between the Portrait mode shots you can get from the wide-angle lens on the 11 versus the telephoto lens on the 11 Pro. To make sure I was the same size in both shots, I stood further away for the shot on the 11 Pro. You can see how it drastically changes the background field of view, which sometimes you’ll want, sometimes you won’t. (Bear in mind that on the 11 Pro, you could have taken either of these shots, because it can do Portrait mode from multiple lenses).When viewed full size, you might also notice that the iPhone 11’s shot actually has more detail, especially in the material of my jumper, and around my stubble. The wide-angle lens is likely able to pick out the detail better because more light gets into it than through the telephoto lens.That said, the telephoto shot has a more convincing depth of field affect around my hair.iPhone 11, wide-angle lensThere’s nothing special about this pic in itself, other than that my cat has an adorable bow. The interesting this is that this pic got taken /at all/: the cat was walking towards me to bump her head on the camera, and somehow I was able to bring up the camera, focus, and Portrait mode did its thing in time. There was, I would say, a quarter of a second at most for this.Any older iPhone simple wouldn’t have been capable of a) getting all that done in time, and b) literally taking this shot at this angle, because these are the first iPhones that can do Portrait mode on any subject on a lens other than the telephoto. So yes, this shot is a tad blurry because she’s moving, and it ain’t art… but it exists!Left: Night mode turned off. Right: Night modeWe’ve abandoned glamour for our Night mode comparison, because we wanted to get gritty and realistic – this is from the corner of a garage that light pretty much just doesn’t reach, so whatever Night mode does is the best you can hope for. It’s also great for showing how the mode lifts detail from nowhere.The wall goes from being a smeary patch of pixels to something with actual texture, and the black shade in the bottom corner suddenly becomes a floor. The broken light has tons more detail to it, and obviously the overall look is massively boosted.Night mode works by taking a longer shot – the exact length depends on how dark it is and how shaky your hands are, with the iPhone automatically adjusting as needed – and is set to just jump in automatically when it’s needed. If you can rest the iPhone, or even use a tripod, you can set the length up to 30 seconds (our shot above was three seconds), which is capable of producing some incredible starlight shots.The iPhone 11 is top-end when it comes to video, too. Apple’s 4K footage is absolutely fantastic, the extended dynamic range of the sensor producing incredibly colourful footage with detail in everything from highlights to shadows.But the biggest win is the image stabilisation, which makes hand-held footage look like it’s from a gimbal. It means that everything stays much crisper, and will even try to prioritise the subject, subtly making sure they stay as close to the centre of the frame as possible.When footage isn’t shaky, it comes out sharper – it elevates the quality here dramatically.The buzzing heart of the iPhone 11 is Apple’s A13 processor, which is the newest and fastest processor from the company that already made the fastest processor last year, and has yet to be bested.This means the iPhone 11 is a screamer when it comes to speed – everything is instant. Some of this is down to iOS 13 speeding up some key parts of the software on all devices, and some of it is down to the new chip, which is 15-20% faster than last year’s iPhone XS, depending on task.Processing power is not something that phones tend to lack in these days – even mid-range Android models regularly have beefy chips that are only just behind the top-end models, if they’re really behind at all.But it’s still great that’s Apple cheaper model absolutely does not feel cheaper in this vital measure  – there’s no penalty in the experience at all for saving yourself a few hundred quid.One of the key new elements of the A13 is a much improved neural processor, used for the camera processing trickery (among other things), and again it’s great to be able to feel this power when you’re using the camera – you might not have as many lenses as an iPhone 11 Pro, but you still get the incredible response time of the Portrait mode (as mentioned above) and the full power of Night mode.GeekBench 4Battery benchmark: 4084CPU single: 5474CPU multi: 13962GeekBench 5CPU single: 1333CPU multi: 3470Apple’s strongest graphics chip is also in the A13, and given that the iPhone was already  pretty much the most powerful handheld gaming device even without any kind of special gamer-focused features, this keeps it ahead of the game (especially with Apple Arcade turning out to be a hell of a great range of games for ridiculously cheap price).Apple has focused on reducing power usage with the A13 this year, though the iPhone 11 benefits more subtly than the Pro models. The larger battery in the iPhone 11 Pro Max has made it the best phone for longevity this year, while the iPhone 11 comes in second – last year, those positions were reversed, with the iPhone XR beating the iPhone XS Max. In both years, the 5.8-inch iPhone comes third.But still, we’re talking really great longevity from this model, which again means you’re not getting short-changed if you don’t want to spend Pro money. For light users, you can get through two days. Heavy users will definitely have battery left at the end of the day, assuming you don’t literally play Fortnite non-stop.Apple still ships the phone with 5W charger, which is just cheap at this point. The Pro models come with an 18W charger, and I really feel that this should be standard. It can charge faster if you use higher-power adapters, though. There’s also wireless charging.One other small area that’s been sped up is Face ID recognition – a new version of the tech makes it slightly faster and slightly more reliable. It’s not game-changing, but it’s welcome.If you have an iPhone 8 or earlier, I think this is the ideal upgrade model – especially if you’ve got one of the earlier phones. Everything about the 11 is better than what came before – you’re going to get a huge jump in speed, screen quality, camera capability and design.If you have an iPhone X, I think it’s a tougher call. You’ve got better battery life and an improved overall camera system here (you’ll be trading your telephoto lens for an ultra-wide, which a question of preference as much as anything) that includes Night mode – and those alone might be enough. There are also lots of small quality-of-life improvements, including a little bit of extra speed (not that the X is a slouch now), new speakers, better wireless connectivity and faster Face ID. But you’ll be swapping your lovely OLED screen for a slightly less rich OLED one – though it’ll be bigger. Personally, I’d be keen to upgrade to the 11 over the X mainly for the camera, but I don’t think you’d be mad to hold off another year.For iPhone XR owners, it’s especially tough. You can get nearly the same phone, but with almost every part improved a little bit, including the ability to use Portrait mode for subjects other than people, and the second ultra-wide lens, plus Night mode, of course. I suspect most people won’t see it as being worth the upgrade cost this year, but I wouldn’t blame you.Those who have an iPhone XS should probably only look to the iPhone 11 Pro for an upgrade, or hold off. You’ve already got dual cameras (though again with a telephoto instead of ultra-wide) that perform close to what the 11 is capable of (excluding Night mode), and a much nicer HDR screen. The 11 would be a sideways move – the 11 Pro would be an upgrade.One last mention for iPhone SE owners: the iPhone 11 being the cheaper of the new phones will make an obvious candidate for those looking to move on at last, but bear in mind that it’s pretty large. Purely on its own terms, it’s a fantastic upgrade, but if size is a concern, give serious thought to spending the extra on the smaller 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro.This is all about the balance. The balance of cutting back features to make it over £300 quid cheaper than the iPhone 11 Pro, but without making it feel anything other than a high-quality Apple product.And the short answer is Apple has balanced better than Simone Biles. It feels like a top-tier handset in almost every way, from the build quality in your hand to the camera quality to the sheer slickness of using iOS.The only areas where it falls a little short are the lack of HDR screen for movies, and that there’s no zoom lens at all, so you don’t get the same flexibility as the iPhone 11 Pro (or the slightly more expensive Huawei P30 Pro).In every other way, this is a massively impressive phone, and is the iPhone that most people should buy this year.Many thanks to Vodafone for supplying a device for review.

65,Realme 7,Realme 7 review: Realme's latest budget phone has plenty of appeal,"The Realme 7 might be the phone for you if you need something even cheaper than the Realme 7 Pro: it has a slightly bigger screen and a bigger battery, while the specs inside and the rear camera array are a little more modest than what you get with the Pro.It's another solid budget Android offering from Realme, which has been putting out affordable, well-built handsets for a couple of years now (and longer in China). The company was originally spun out of Oppo, another Chinese electronics manufacturer.While the Realme 7 is of course quite modest in all the key areas – the screen, the internal specs, the camera quality – it nevertheless gives you plenty of smartphone for your money, and is going to be able to do everything you need it to if you make the investment.Our full Realme 7 review is going to take you through everything you need to know about this handset – from how long the battery lasts between charges to how well the camera performs in low light – so you should be able to work out if it's the phone for you.The Realme 7 phone is out now and available to buy in the UK – you can pick it up unlocked and SIM-free for £179 and up. Amazon is one of the retailers stocking the phone, while you can also buy it directly from Realme. The phone isn't available in the US.While the thickness and the plastic of the Realme 7 will leave you in no doubt that this is a budget smartphone, Realme has done a respectable job in adding some premium-looking trimmings. The back of the phone is a nicely judged blue or white (depending on which model you go for), which catches the light in different ways as you move it. The rear camera array is neatly positioned up at the top left corner around the back, and in the hand this feels like a solid and well put together device.The LCD display looks better than you would expect at this price, interrupted only by a punch hole selfie camera notch up in the top left corner. 6.5 inches of screen space certainly gives you plenty of room to work with, while the 1080 x 2400 pixel resolution and 90Hz refresh rate mean you get a sharp, smooth experience while using it.The Realme 7 Pro has a smaller display but uses the superior OLED technology, which usually makes for brighter colours and deeper blacks. The panel on the Realme 7 isn't quite as good, but it's still perfectly fine for all the ways you're going to use your smartphone: playing games, browsing the web, sending and receiving messages and so on. It doesn't feel like a budget smartphone display.Realme has embedded the fingerprint sensor inside the power button, a move which we're not particularly fond of – it makes it a bit more awkward to use as both a sensor and a button. You do get a headphone jack down at the bottom of the phone, together with a single speaker and a USB-C port. There's no waterproofing or dustproofing on the Realme 7, which is pretty much par for the course at this price point, so you might want to invest in a case as well.The Realme 7 camera won't let you down but doesn't really dazzle either. There are four cameras around the back – 48MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 2MP depth. Those ultrawide and macro lenses do give you some opportunities for experimenting with your photos, but in terms of end results everything is pretty standard and what you would expect at this price point.HDR processing works reasonably well, so you won't lose parts of your pictures in particularly dark or light patches, and shutter speed and focus speed are good. Colours can be a bit too saturated at times, and the images won't hold up to the highest level of scrutiny in terms of noise and detail, but considering the price you're paying for this phone the camera quality is perfectly respectable.Night and low light photography is where the Realme 7 starts to seriously struggle, with a lot more noise creeping in and a lot less detail being captured – there is a dedicated night mode but aside from a basic brightness boost it doesn't really help too much. If there is some light available then you can usually get some usable shots out of the phone, but don't expect too much in terms of low light photography.Battery life impresses on the whole, with the 5,000mAh-capacity battery lasting well into a second day unless you're really pushing it. Forgetting an overnight charge isn't going to be a problem with the Realme 7, especially as 30W fast charging is supported (though there's no wireless charging available). In our two-hour, maximum brightness video streaming test the battery dropped from 100 percent to 79 percent, which is one of the better results we've seen.The Realme 7 comes powered by a Mediatek Helio G95 processor, plus a choice of three RAM and storage options: 4GB and 64GB, 6GB and 64GB, or 8GB and 128GB. The top option there is substantially better than the bottom option, though it is obviously going to cost you more as well. The device that we reviewed came with the top configuration of 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.Geekbench 5 scores of 510 (single-core), 1612 (multi-core), and 2227 (OpenCL) reflect the budget processor inside the Realme 7, but we didn't notice any major blips or sluggishness in day-to-day use. The phone can cope with demanding apps and games, albeit with a bit more of a pause between screens, and overall performance is fine. Bear in mind budget phones will start to slow up sooner than more premium models over time though.The phone comes running Android 10 (rather than the latest Android 11), with Realme's own Realme UI put on top. It's fine, in most respects, but like a lot of Chinese manufacturers, Realme tends to plaster its software with over-the-top visuals and redundant apps that you're probably never going to get around to using. We much prefer the clean and classic look of stock Android on the Pixels and selected other phones, though your tastes may differ.You don't get 5G on board the Realme 7, which may or may not bother you based on whether the next-gen connectivity has reached your part of the world. 5G is by no means an essential feature at the moment, and most of us will be able to get by with the still-very-speedy 4G for the next couple of years at least. You can get budget phones with 5G on board, but you'll need to pay a bit more than what the Realme 7 costs.Of course the Realme 7 isn't going to offer the screen quality, the premium build and the camera capabilities of the top flagship and mid-range phones on the market – but then again it does cost a fraction of the price of those handsets as well. The question is whether you get plenty of value for your money, and the answer (as it often is with Realme phones) is a resounding yes.There aren't really any outstandingly good features on this phone – its price is its biggest selling point – but then there's nothing that's disappointing or terrible either. You're paying not much money at all for a handset that is capable in every department, and you'd struggle to find an Android phone that's actually usable for anything less.The screen is big and crisp, the battery life is very good, and the Realme 7 will run everything you need it to: if that's enough for you then it's a very affordable buy. If you need some of the more advanced smartphone features on the market, like 5G, wireless charging, waterproofing and a telephoto camera, then you're going to have to look elsewhere (and pay more).Before buying your next smartphone, we'd recommend checking out what the competition has to offer, as there are some excellent budget phones available to buy right now (from Motorola, Nokia and others). However, if you want a little money to go a long way with your next phone, then Realme 7 could be the handset for you.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/realme-7-review
66,Apple iPhone 12 Pro,Apple iPhone 12 Pro review: a premium flagship in a usable size,"To bring you this comprehensive iPhone 12 Pro review, I have been living with Apple's higher-end 6.1-inch phone from 2020. Long story short, it's absolutely one of the best phones on the planet.Between this and the iPhone 12, there's actually no difference in size. What sets the iPhone 12 Pro apart is its features and materials - it has a brighter screen, larger internal memory, and even more to play with in terms of camera features. Not only that but you'll even get a slightly more premium stainless steel and frosted rear glass finish.Okay so those improvements are hardly dramatic, in fact, some are even quite niche but those who want them are sure to see the difference. That's particularly true when it comes to the camera.This is increasingly the direction Apple is going with its 'Pro' products: it's about specific features for high-end users rather than them just making them faster or sleeker.As you'd expect, more high-end features come with a price tag to match, and that is sure to put a lot of people off. But if you're prepared to splash out, you'll get a phone that really feels worth the price, both in terms of being as slick and powerful as phones come, as well as literally feeling so premium – it's the most beautifully made and designed phone we've ever seen, while also bucking the trend that having features this good requires a phone to be tablet-sized.Remember, if you pick up an iPhone 12 Pro be sure to keep it secure with one of the best iPhone 12 cases.The iPhone 12 Pro's release date was October 23rd 2020, and its official price starts from £999/$999/AU$1,649. That includes 128GB of storage, which is a good amount for most people. It's double the 64GB that the iPhone 12 comes with, and you won't really need to upgrade from there unless you have a specific need in mind, such as storing loads of music or movies, etc.Bigger options include a 256GB version for £1,099/$1,099/AU$1,869, or you can go with the extra-capacious 512GB model for $1,299/$1,299/AU$2,219.This is essentially the same launch price as the iPhone 11 Pro was for its own launch last year, though it's a little cheaper in the UK and Australia, which is good to see (and runs counter to the price rise the iPhone 12 had).Like the iPhone 12, Apple no longer includes a charging block in the box (though does include a Lightning-to-USB-C cable), and there are no wired headphones either. It feels a little cheap, but I mind it less here because the target market is going to feel the effect much less than those that those who might pick up the more mid-range-focused iPhone 12.You can buy a 20W fast-charging plug from Apple for £19/$19, and I suspect few people who spend this much on a phone ever put the included headphones in their ears anyway.Not only do I think this is the iPhone 12 Pro is the best-looking iPhone to date, I also think it's one of the best-looking gadgets of any kind, though with something of a caveat.I have the gold version, which is both why I like it so much, and part of my caveat. The new iPhone design features the flat edges of the iPad Air (2020) rather than the curved sides of the iPhone 11 Pro. The back is flat glass, and in the case of the gold phone is a kind of off-white/satin colour. This leaves a solid gold band around the outside, visible from the front, that looks pristinely flat and thin, surrounding a gleaming black oblong on the front.It makes this phone look more like a piece of jewellery – an accessory – than other phones, and that's what I love. Do you remember luxury phone company Vertu? This is what they were going for but never managed to achieve: a gadget that looks like it was made by Cartier.And not just looks it; feels like it too. This thing is significantly heavier than the iPhone 12, which just makes it feel more like it might be real gold or something. (Mercifully, it will will survive a fall much better than gold would.)Of course, the caveat may have already become clear to you: not everyone wants a phone that looks more like a gold bracelet than a computer.Thankfully, there are colours other than gold. The new Pacific Blue (which features in our photography in this review) is as oceanic as its name suggests, while the Graphite (which is basically a black option) and Silver give you looks more similar to what we're used to in previous iPhones, but still with the shiny edge of stainless steel.The trick to them all being so nice, at different levels of bling-ness, is that they're unfussy. It's a smooth black front with a shiny metal rim, a plain steel side, and a matt frosted glass rear.It's not just the materials that have changed. The iPhone 12 Pro fits its 6.1-inch screen into a frame only a tiny bit bigger than the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, thanks to smaller bezels and removing those curved edges. This means the screen is just as easy to reach across, though is a little harder to reach high up with one hand.But the big screen fills even more of the handset, and it's great. It's not a life-changing size upgrade, but it definitely feels like a step forward.The notch for Face ID and the front camera is still there. You wonder if Apple couldn't have slimmed it or something by now, but I think its size and shape have become part of the iPhone's visual identity, and so won't change until Apple is ready for a shift that will last for a while.I'm disappointed that the new Touch ID button from the iPad Air hasn't made it here as a secondary form of security for when you're wearing a mask, though.The iPhone 12 Pro includes Apple's new 'Ceramic Shield' glass, which it says is four times more likely to survive a drop. This doesn't necessarily make it more scratchproof, I should note – resistance to shattering and scratching are very different specialities – and whether a drop breaks a phone or not is subject to a lot of unpredictable factors.But still, it looks like this will mean fewer screen repairs based on anecdotal evidence so far (I have not subjected mine to a drop test, sorry).MagSafe is one of the new features of the iPhone 12 Pro, and it's a basically a ring of magnets under the rear of the device that you can use to connect accessories.They surround the wireless charging equipment, so one of MagSafe's uses is more efficient wireless charging (up to 15W), because if you use a compatible wireless charger (such as Apple's own MagSafe charger), it's held in the optimal position, making a higher-power connection possible.I'm not really wowed by MagSafe so far, however. I find its current options somewhat underwhelming: it can be used to hold on cases, but I don't actually like Apple's specific cases (the silicon is more slippery than the phone); it can hold a wallet accessory onto the back, but this is in major danger of being knocked off when sliding the phone into your pocket; and the MagSafe charger is heavier than just using a cable, and not really any more convenient since it needs to be manually detached, unlike a regular wireless charger where you can just grab your phone and go.There are some better-looking devices coming, including desk and car mounts that charge your iPhone, and even a portable video-recording rig that makes use of it while also holding a light and camera. So I'm optimistic there will be cool products in the future, but it's not something that elevates the phone for me.The iPhone 12 Pro's screen is slightly larger at 6.1 inches than the iPhone 11 Pro (5.8 inches), and so is slightly higher resolution, but that's the only real display difference between the new phone and last year's.The iPhone 12 Pro has an OLED display, with a resolution of 1170x2532, which is 460 pixels per inch. That's exactly the same as the iPhone 12. The iPhone 11 Pro was 1125x2436, which is 458 pixels per inch, so the detail difference is academic, really.Having a slightly larger screen at the same level of comfort is certainly welcome, though, and with the a typical brightness of 800 nits and claimed peak HDR brightness of 1,200 nits, it's nothing less than genuinely stunning, especially when making use of its Dolby Vision HDR support to watch movies and TV.These kinds of figures are better than what a lot of flagship TVs can manage, and almost any other phone. The OnePlus 8 Pro is the closest for screen quality.One of the more 'pro' elements of the screen is that the colour accuracy is incredible. You'll see the results when you take photos and Dolby Vision HDR video, but it's also basically as perfectly calibrated as displays get, and includes support for the wide P3 colour gamut.Is this something most people need – more than the very nice colour accuracy most phone give you? No, not really. But it's definitely 'pro'.The big talk around the screen in the iPhone 12 Pro is the lack of 90Hz or 120Hz support. The iPhone remains stubbornly 60Hz.It's a bit surprising not to see support here, since the iPad Pro includes 120Hz. But in the iPad Pro, it has a practical purpose: when combined with the Apple Pencil, it makes what you're drawing appear faster, which is really important for accuracy.The only equivalent practical use on iPhone is gaming, which also benefits from faster response times. The rest of the time, a higher refresh rate makes things animate more smoothly, which is very nice, but it isn't essential.High refresh rates also have a notable battery impact – it can be close to a 10% reduction on some handsets.I wish that Apple had included a high-refresh screen as an option on its Pro phones in 2020, for those of us prepared to take the hit, because it's one of those things that's hard to go back from once you try it. Some will also say that it's a big miss in the spec list, especially for this kind of money, which is a fair point.But while I don't love that it's missing, I'm okay with it. The iPhone beats other phones in other areas, and this is an area of lower importance than, say, cameras as far as I'm concerned.The speakers in the iPhone 12 Pro haven't changed drastically, but Apple already put pretty impressive sound in. They sound really clear for listening to generally, especially around voices, making them great for voice calls or listening to podcasts and stuff, and music is much better than built-in speakers have any reason to be, really.Well, there is a reason, and it's watching video. When you hold the device in front of you, the stereo speakers produce a surprisingly impressive soundscape – specific sounds move around the screen, and to the left and right of your head. It's some damn clever tech… that few people will ever hear, because most people watch moves with actually decent sound mixes using headphones anyway.The iPhone 12 Pro's triple-lens appears very similar to the iPhone 11 Pros, but there are improvements inside and out that bring noticeable improvements in lots of areas, all working together to make this the highest-quality camera on a phone (at least, until the iPhone 12 Pro Max appears).First, let's address something that hasn't changed, which some people won't be happy about: the telephoto lens. It's a 2x zoom compared to the wide-angle camera, which is the same as the 11 Pro. With the likes of the Samsung S20 Ultra offering a 5x telephoto lens (and an impressive 10x hybrid zoom), it feels like Apple is behind here… but there's an element of preference around this that people don't always talk about.Remember that a phone zoom lens isn't versatile like a camera zoom lens – you can't make it optically longer and shorter at will. If the only telephoto lens your phone has is the 5x zoom, you're gaining the ability to snap things further away (great!) but losing the ability to take a nice 2x zoom portrait shot of something less far away, because the 5x is also your minimum zoom range. If you want to take a 2x zoom shot on a phone with a longer length, you have to use digital zoom, which reduces detail.So in the case of zooms on phones, more isn't automatically better. It's fancier, and more impressive tech, no doubt, but whether it's desirable in practice is a matter of preference.Apple seems to think having a shorter zoom distance is more useful. I'd like a little more – perhaps 3x – because I think that would still be good for versatility, and it's interesting that the iPhone 12 Pro Max will actually include a 2.5x zoom instead of the 2x zoom here.While I certainly wish I could zoom further from time to time on the iPhone 12 Pro, and I understand if people are frustrated Apple didn't go further with it, I don't think it's a fundamental problem that it hasn't changed here. It's a trade-off, and you'll just have to decide if you agree with Apple that's better to get pristine shots at 2x than to be able to shoot longer.As I mentioned, though, other stuff has changed. The three lenses are still a wide-angle (which now has a wider f/1.6 aperture than the 11 Pro), an ultra-wide lens (which is a 0.5x zoom compared to the wide) and that 2x telephoto. All three lenses have 12MP sensors, as does the lone forward-facing camera.The new Apple A14 processor includes more advanced image processing than ever, including an upgraded version of Smart HDR, which handles exposure across your shots.Night mode is now available on all three rear lenses, as well as the forward lens. Night mode has also been improved for even better performance, and you can take Portrait mode shots with Night mode, adding even more versatility in different lighting conditions.Taking Portrait mode Night shots really needs a steady hand or tripod if you want the crisp edges and detail befitting of Portrait shot, and it's the same with Night mode selfies, but the quality of light you can get from them is far beyond a flash, which will obviously give you clear lighting up close, but nothing behind. And also, flashes aren't example aesthetically pleasing.And there's a new piece of hardware to help with low-light shooting in particular: LIDAR. A depth-scanning sensor on the back makes autofocus so much faster in low light, since it detects distance separately from the actual camera sensor – the difference compared to other phones, or even the iPhone 12, is fast. It's not only fast, it's accurately, getting the camera locked on quickly. It could make all the difference for actually getting the shot you want before something or someone moves.The iPhone 12 Pro also supports Apple's new ProRAW image format, which enables the camera to take raw photos, but still with some of Apple's more fundamental processing applied, such as HDR control and the Deep Fusion mixing of different frames into one final image. The idea is that you get the creative flexibility of a raw photo for editing, but with a higher-quality image than the pure raw shot a phone sensor would normally give you.We've got a specific, super in-depth review of the iPhone 12 Pro's camera coming soon, but in the meantime here are some example shots to show you want it can do.A Portrait Mode shot, taken with the 2x telephoto lens. This shows how well the camera grabs natural light – it all looks natural, from the spots in direct sunlight to the black fur in shadow. It also shows both the good work and the limits of Portrait Mode's detection – on the left side of the head, the fur has been retained in the sharp part of the image, on the right (in the shadow) the fur and whiskers have had a little trim. See a full-size version.More cat – but for comparison, this is a shot just using the wide-angle camera and no Portrait Mode, so any depth blur is all natural. There's a truly incredibly around of detail, and the contrast the camera can pick up makes the fur look more 3D than just about any other camera – the mix of light and dark in and around the right eye in particular is incredible. See a full-size version.Another look at detail, this time in more flat lighting. But again, there's real depth in the textures here, and the vibrant sheen on the red is true to life. See a full-size version here.This is a test of the new lens correction on the ultra-wide lens – notice how we get the perspective of being at the bottom of the tree, but it doesn't get all misshapen at the bottom or top edges. The house and lamp-post keep their straight lines too. Smart HDR 3 is also doing a good job here, balancing the trunk in direct sunlight with the shaded branches at the top-left. See a full-size version here.This landscape shot again shows Smart HDR 3 off impressively – the bush at the bottom-left and the back of the bench are allowed to be dark, but you can still see the texture in them. The rest of the picture captures the light colours of an autumn day perfectly.Aside from still photos, Apple has a new feature for video that it's making a big deal out of, and that's Dolby Vision HDR.As the first camera of any kind to record in Dolby Vision HDR (kind of – it records in HLG HDR, which is converted to Dolby Vision), the iPhone 12 Pro is equipped to take videos with better colour and lighting capture than any other phone.The advantage of HDR is that it captures more information in shadows and highlights, more like what the eye can see. Being able to record and share in HDR gives people even more of a sense of 'being there', because it doesn't look so much like, well, video taken on a phone.The better colour and light definition is also great for professional video making, because it means you can achieve more impressive 'looks'. More than ever, an iPhone is all a dedicated student of movies needs to make a genuinely professional-looking film, especially when combined with Apple's incredibly impressive image stabilisation, which is right up there with the best in the business.The results of the HDR video look just wonderful on the iPhone's own screen, which takes full advantage of them. But the problem with Dolby Vision, and HDR in general online, is that support is spotty at best. It's incredibly difficult to get Dolby Vision videos to any other screen with the full quality intact.Sharing to an online service will cause the iPhone to create a version at the maximum quality that service says it can handle, which may or may not include HDR, but definitely won't include Dolby Vision (at the time of writing). And there have been cases, as with Facebook and Instagram, where the videos didn't look right because of issues with the HDR video not being correctly handled.Having a Dolby Vision is a really great feature, and it records in 4K at 60fps on the iPhone 12 Pro (only 30fps on the iPhone 12), which makes it look even more realistic. And the way Apple's implemented it so that, in theory, you can shoot at maximum quality and it just exports at the best possible quality for whatever service you're sharing to, is really clever.But you should just know that getting people to see your video at the maximum quality is much, much easier said than done.5G is one of the biggest new features on the iPhone 12 Pro's spec sheet, though it does share that with the iPhone 12, of course. These are the first 5G iPhones, and they work with every kind of 5G around the world, though the models are slightly different depending on if you're in the US or not.In the US, the iPhone 12 models support mmWave 5G, which is the very fastest possible form of 5G, but it isn't getting so much traction around the world. Most countries are opting for regular ol' 5G, so outside the US, there's no mmWave support on the iPhone 12 Pro.I tested the 5G support in my city, and saw the kinds of speeds we were promised by the technology, hitting 500Mbps for downloads. However, many places with 5G are also seeing their 4G networks in the same places upgraded in a way that finally realises the promised potential of 4G, which means that I actually got 250Mbps on 4G, which is still faster than the wired internet connection of… well, almost everyone.That kind of 5G speed really is noticeable. Opening a webpage is just instant. No images and text popping in, you just hit go and there it all is at once. Downloading several gigabytes of films takes a couple of minutes… and ate 3% of battery life on its own, in my case.Because 5G is so battery hungry, Apple has implemented it by default in a kind of special 'Only when needed' mode. The iPhone will detect how intensive your online activity is, and if you're in a 5G area, it'll make use of 5G's speeds if they seem necessary. If you're just refreshing Twitter or something else light, it'll stick with 4G.You can force it to use 5G when possible, or to even disable 5G totally if you want to save battery life.The thing about 5G here in 2020 – a year in which the 5G rollout hasn't been quite as large as expected for forgivable reasons – is that it's a selling-point for future-proofing, but not so much for getting an immediate benefit unless you live in the right part of the right cities.5G isn't the only speed improvement in the iPhone 12 Pro, though. The new A14 processor maintains Apple's lead as maker of the fastest phone chips in the world. In benchmarks, it's around 20% faster than the A13 chip in the iPhone 11 Pro, while also featuring improvements in other areas that help with things like the new cameras features. Its ludicrous power is the reason features such as Dolby Vision video recording and editing are possible, too.Of course, last year's iPhones felt very fast in practice, so it's not like the old days where you noticed a major leap from generation to generation. Apps still open almost instantly, and the interface is totally smooth.The useful thing about all that power is the future-proofing – with as much power as a MacBook Pro (really), this can handle any app you throw at it, now or years from now.Apple claims that the iPhone 12 Pro will get roughly the same battery life overall as the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro. Recent iPhones have been taken good steps forward in battery life year over year, so it's a shame to see that come to a halt here.It's technologically understandable: a bigger screen in the same size body is more of a strain on battery life, as is 5G, infamously. Teardowns have also revealed that the battery inside is actually smaller than the on the iPhone 11 Pro, and that the circuit board has become larger, seemingly to accommodate the electronics needed for 5G.With these in mind, Apple has actually lowered its energy use here! But not in a way that brings longevity improvements to those of us using the phones, sadly.In practice, we see very similar life to the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, meaning that it's capable of lasting through a day for all but the most hardcore users. To get through two days would require more light use.It's by no means a class leader in this regard, but it tends to be bigger phones that take this trophy, so the iPhone 12 Pro Max will probably put up a stronger showing. Battery life isn't bad, it's just average.You can charge it pretty quickly when needed – it offers fast charging over a wired connection with a powerful enough adapter (20W), and MagSafe charging can reach 15W. It also supports Qi regular wireless charging up to 7.5W.The iPhone 12 Pro is a truly excellent phone, at a luxury price. You can pay less for a phone that matches or beats it in some individual areas – the screen, the camera image quality, the battery – but no cheaper phone is so good in so many areas at once. And also looks this good while doing it.And at the same time, it's doing all this at a size that's smaller than flagship rivals. 6.1 inches might not be truly compact, but no equivalently high end phone is trying to squeeze this much engineering in the same kind of body.Not everyone will find it worth spending this much money on something that's a little better than phones considerably cheaper – and in the case of some features, it may simply not offer something you think is vital – but it's the level of polish inside and outside (literally, in the latter case) that makes this so impressive overall.The iPhone 12 is the obvious alternative, here. It's the same size (including the screen), and the same design, but with aluminium instead of steel, and a different range of colours. The camera is similarly excellent, but is dual-lens and doesn't include the LIDAR sensor. The screen is just as strong for HDR, but is a little less bright in normal use. Here's our full iPhone 12 review.The iPhone 12 Pro Max is for those who want better battery life, a bigger screen, an even better camera… or all three. It's identical to the 12 Pro in most ways, but you've got a 6.7-inch screen, and a much bigger sensor on the wide-angle camera with more advanced image stabilisation, meaning its performance in mid-to-light is noticeably improved. And the bigger body means more battery size, which means more longevity. We'll have a review for you soon.Our pick of the Android alternatives would be the OnePlus 8 Pro if your focus is on the screen and slick performance. The display there is just as good for HDR punch and actually offers high-refresh rate support, for those want it. It's also significantly cheaper than the 12 Pro, though you don't get as good a camera. Read our full OnePlus 8 Pro review.The best Android camera option while still getting a slick full Android experience is the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G. Samsung's software is great, and you have the option of a high-refresh screen (though you have to lower the resolution if you want it). The camera is also full of tricks, including a 108MP sensor and 10x hybrid zoom (5x optical-only zoom). Here's our full Samsung S20 Ultra review.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/iphone-12-pro-review
67,Huawei Mate 40 Pro,Huawei Mate 40 Pro review: superb phone hardware with some app annoyances,"The Huawei Mate 40 Pro finds itself with the same problem as other recent Huawei handsets: top-notch hardware but issues on the software front since the US stopped it from dealing with Google. That means you might not be able to run all the apps you need.While some can be cloned and sideloaded, and more are appearing in Huawei's own app store, apps that rely on Google's mobile software framework aren't going to work – that includes several key Google apps such as Google Photos, Google Maps and Gmail.There are workarounds – you can get at your Gmail email through a different client, for example – it continues to be a challenge for Huawei and its phones, even though the company is making progress in improving the app experience on its newest handsets.What we can say is that the fit and finish of the phone is absolutely first class, as usual. With fantastic camera and battery performance, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro might just have enough in the positives column for you to be able to live with a few app inconveniences.The Huawei Mate 40 Pro is available to buy now in the UK, with a recommended retail price of £1,099 SIM-free and unlocked (although check the widgets on this page for the latest online deals). You can pick up the phone direct from Huawei, or from various third-party retailers, including Carphone Warehouse and EE.There's no doubt that the Huawei Mate 40 Pro is a gorgeous-looking smartphone – you'll struggle to find a phone with a more premium appearance this year, including anything made by Apple or Samsung. The circular camera design on the back is slightly unusual, but we think it looks good, and the silver backing that our review model came with shimmers brilliantly in the light.The screen plays a big role in the overall aesthetics: the large 6.76-inch OLED display runs at a resolution of 1344 x 2772 pixels and with a 90Hz refresh rate, with curved edges at the side and minimal bezels at the top and bottom. It's sharp and bright and crisp, with HDR10 support that helps give an extra punch to streaming video apps. No matter what you're reading or watching, the display is hugely impressive.While it's not the thinnest or lightest phone that you're going to come across, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro feels comfortable in the hand, with a finish that makes the phone feel as expensive as it actually is. The dual 13MP+13MP selfie camera feels a bit excessive, especially as it cuts significantly into the top left hand corner of the display – the sooner phone makers work out how to put the selfie camera under the display, the better.The phone is fully protected against water and dust with an IP68 rating, and there's a USB-C port for data transfer and charging. You don't get a 3.5mm headphone jack, but there are built-in stereo speakers. The power and volume buttons are both on the right of the handset as you look at it, with a fingerprint sensor embedded under the screen. Besides the silver version we've reviewed here, white, black, green and yellow colours are available, depending on your region.Huawei handsets are well known for the quality of their cameras, and the rear camera attached to the Mate 40 Pro is another impressive offering from the company: there's a triple lens 50MP wide + 12MP telephoto (with 5x optical zoom) + 20MP ultrawide camera on the back and you'll be able to get some very good results indeed from it. The front-facing camera isn't bad either, a 13MP ultrawide lens coupled with a 3D time-of-flight depth sensor.As we've come to expect from Huawei, images taken with the rear camera are first class. Colours are bright and well balanced, details are sharp and clear (even in the darkest and lightest spots of a scene), and the ultrawide lens gives you plenty of flexibility when it comes to fitting more into a particular shot. The 5x telephoto zoom is very handy to have as well, and can't be beaten by anything else on the market at the moment.Low light performance is outstanding as well, with the Huawei Mate 40 Pro able to pick out details in the dark that other phone cameras can't get near to finding. The specialised night mode asks you to keep the handset still for several seconds, but if you can manage that you get really great results – it's a rear camera that can actually see in the dark. This makes some low light shots look unnatural, but it's impressive nonetheless. It's one of the most capable night modes we've seen on a phone camera to date.Battery life on the Huawei Mate 40 Pro is impressive: two hours of video streaming at a low volume and maximum brightness only knocked the 4,400 mAh battery down from 100 percent to 90 percent, a really impressive result. In general use, you can get well over a day's use between charges – sometimes closer to two – and the super-speedy 66W wired and 50W wireless charging mean you can get the handset juiced up in no time at all.The Huawei Mate 40 Pro is a smartphone packed with power, thanks to the Kirin 9000 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB or 512GB of internal storage (you can expand that further if you want, via Huawei's own memory card format). 5G connectivity is supported too, as you would expect from a top-tier smartphone in 2020. During our time with the handset, it absolutely zipped along through every app we tested it with.As you're probably aware, for some time now Huawei phones have been unable to use the Google Play Store. This is a real annoyance but Huawei is working hard to limit the damage: while the Huawei AppGallery lacks a lot of big names, the phone makes it easy to sideload apps from unofficial sources on the web. We got apps such as Spotify, Instagram and Dropbox working this way, though core Google apps like Gmail still won't work.This sideloading approach is a bit more fiddly than using an app store – it's also less secure in terms of avoiding malware and means you have to check for app updates manually too. In other words, while you can get most of the major apps up and running on a Huawei phone now, it's still not ideal. We've always found Huawei's EMUI software rather bloated and busy too, which doesn't help.The app situation is improving, but it's still a drawback of buying a phone from Huawei at the moment. We can at least report that the hardware is more than capable of running the most demanding apps and games, if you can actually get them installed somehow. This is a phone where you won't have to worry about lag or sluggishness for a good couple of years at least.The Mate 40 Pro is more of the same from Huawei: top-tier hardware design, with an excellent camera and impressive performance, and continuing software struggles in terms of official app support. If you're heavily reliant on Google apps and want the most seamless app experience possible, it's hard to recommend this phone, especially considering the price you pay for it.If you can live with a few app inconveniences – like having to run YouTube inside a mobile browser rather than as a native app – in return for some flagship-level specs, design and performance, then the Huawei Mate 40 Pro might well be worth shortlisting for your next phone upgrade. If you take the software side out of it, this is undoubtedly one of the phones of the year, albeit on the expensive side.Considering apps are such a fundamental part of the software experience though, it's worth double-checking that you'll be able to run your favourites on this phone. It's also fair to say that the appeal of top-level flagships – whether from Huawei, Apple, Samsung or anyone else – isn't quite as strong as it was considering there are now so many very capable mid-range phones on the market.When it comes to choosing a smartphone, camera and battery performance are two of the key considerations for just about everyone, and it's in these areas that the Huawei Mate 40 Pro excels – and the screen and the design is rather impressive as well. After spending several days with the phone, it's those strong points rather than any weaknesses that will last longer in the memory.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/huawei-mate-40-pro-review
68,Google Pixel 4a 5G,Google Pixel 4a 5G review: the perfectly balanced Pixel of 2020,"The Pixel 4a 5G sums up the weird year it's been for the Google Pixel series – this is a phone half way between the Pixel 4a and the Pixel 5, and it feels like Google could've dropped at least one of the three for simplicity's sake. But is it the right phone for you?It's cheaper than the Pixel 5, while offering a lot of the same specs – including the rear camera and the processor running everything, which is the Snapdragon 765G. On the other hand, the Pixel 4a might give you everything you need for even less money.Here we'll outline the strengths and weaknesses of the Google Pixel 4a 5G in our full review, covering everything from battery life to camera quality. By the time you've finished reading, you should have a solid idea of how the Pixel 4a 5G stacks up against its rivals.It's actually a great time to be buying a new smartphone, with so many excellent handsets now available at mid-range prices – from the OnePlus Nord to the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. The Google Pixel 4a 5G is definitely able to hold its own though, as we'll explain below.The Google Pixel 4a 5G is currently in short supply, with the Google Store only giving you the opportunity to join a waiting list to receive it. When the phone is available more widely – and plenty of third-party outlets are offering it – you'll pay £499 for it in the UK and $499 in the US. For most people, Just Black is the only colour option – you don't get the cool-looking Sorta Sage variant that you do with the Pixel 5 – but there is a white edition that's exclusive to Verizon in the US.The Pixel 4a 5G is the biggest Pixel Google has pushed out this year, with a 6.2-inch OLED display running at a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels. The refresh rate is a standard 60Hz rather than the 90Hz available on the Pixel 5, but it's perfectly fine – to our eyes the display looks bright, crisp and clear, interrupted only by a single punch hole selfie camera notch.Whether watching movies, scrolling through webpages or playing games, the display stands up to scrutiny. As with every other aspect of the phone, you've got to weigh up the quality against the price, and we think the handset comes out on top in most categories. The bezels around the sides of the phone are nice and thin, with the fingerprint sensor on the rear where it's very easy to access.The chassis as a whole is entirely plastic and rather plain, but it doesn't feel cheap – like the Pixels before it, the Pixel 4a 5G is solidly put together without being in any way flashy. It's not going to turn heads and catch eyes in the same way as a OnePlus or Samsung phone might, but it's pleasant enough to look at, and feels like it's going to last (though there's no IP68 waterproofing here).Connectivity is provided by USB-C, as you would expect, and there's also a 3.5 mm headphone jack here too – by no means a given on smartphones in 2020, so this is perhaps a phone worth weighing up if you want to carry on using your existing wired headphones. The Pixel 4a 5G is unspectacular but quietly competent in terms of its design and screen.The Google Pixel 4a 5G comes with the same 12.2MP wide and 16MP ultrawide rear camera array as the Pixel 5, and there's not much change from the Pixel 4 either – except the ultrawide lens replaces a telephoto one. That's good for fitting more into a scene, but not so good when you're trying to zoom in on something, though Google's pixel-stretching algorithms work pretty well when it comes to digital zoom.As on previous Pixels, the camera quality is top notch – these phones really are among the best at capturing well balanced, crisp, detailed shots every time, and the Pixel 4a 5G continues the tradition. In a variety of lighting conditions and with a variety of subjects, the phone is going to take pictures that are vibrant and sharp.Much has been written about Google's Night Sight technology, and the image processing can do wonders with dark scenes if you can hold the phone steady for a couple of seconds – so much so that it can capture the stars if the conditions are right. While low light photos do occasionally look unnatural, there aren't many better phone cameras at picking out details in the dark (even without Night Sight enabled, in fact).After two hours of video streaming at maximum brightness, the battery level dropped 24 percent from maximum, which is a decent result. Day-to-day use was even better, with the phone's 3,885 mAh battery holding its charge well across the course of 24 hours – you might just be able to stretch to two days of use with the Pixel 4a 5G, if you're careful with how you use it, and enable Android's battery saving options.The Google Pixel 4a 5G has the same Snapdragon 765G processor as the Pixel 5, but the same 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage combination as the Pixel 4a. What that means in day-to-day use is a nippy, 5G-enabled phone that didn't exhibit any lag or stutter in our time with it. You might notice an extra few milliseconds of loading time on the most demanding apps and games compared with the best performing phones on the market, but we think the Snapdragon 765G is a reasonable choice here.It's the same chipset that powers the OnePlus Nord, by the way. In our Geekbench 5 benchmark tests, the Pixel 4a 5G scored 572 for single-core, 1522 for multi-core and 1002 for OpenCL – about what you would expect for a phone with these components packed inside it. The very top-tier phones of 2020 are going to last longer before slowing down, but then again they cost a lot more... and we think this handset will be more than capable of taking everything you can throw at it.The Pixel 4a 5G comes with Android 11 installed, and this being a Pixel phone, you're guaranteed to be first in line for Android updates over the coming years. The clean, uncluttered version of Android that Google uses is one of the best reasons to buy a Pixel – the Google Assistant integration is second to none, and you get some nice app exclusives too, like the Recorder app that can turn spoken audio into digital text in real time.Google has installed a pair of stereo speakers inside the Pixel 4a 5G, and while these are no more than satisfactory, they can reach a reasonable level of volume without distortion. We'd quite happily listen to podcasts using the speakers, and they're fine for the dialog in movies and shows as well. They're not so great for pumping out your tunes from YouTube Music, but then you wouldn't really expect them to be.With the Google Pixel 4a 5G you get the same processor and the same excellent camera as the Pixel 5, plus a bigger screen – all for a significantly lower price. That's quite an appealing deal, whichever way you look at it. With 5G on board as well as Android 11 running the show, we can easily see how the Pixel 4a 5G would be the Pixel of choice for a lot of smartphone buyers this year.There's not as much RAM here as there is inside the Pixel 5 though, and there's no wireless charging or full water resistance, and the screen sticks with a 60Hz refresh rate rather than 90Hz. You don't get the premium metal and glass finish of the Pixel 5 either. Are those trade-offs worth the difference in price? Well it's really up to you – it depends what you want from your next phone and how much you're willing to spend.Taking the other 2020 Pixels out of the equation, the Google Pixel 4a 5G is a very appealing mid-range phone that holds its own against strong competition from Apple, Samsung, OnePlus, Motorola, Nokia, Xiaomi and others. If you're going to go for the Google phone, it'll be because of the quality of the camera, and the quality of the Android software (plus the speedy updates in future).Google knows it's not setting any benchmark records with the Google Pixel 4a, and it's aware of the compromises that it's making with the phone – it'll just be hoping that the price means it's tempting enough for a lot of people to go for. Even with a strong list of competitors, there's a lot to like about the middle Pixel of 2020.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/google-pixel-4a-5g
69,Google Pixel 5,Google Pixel 5 review: the more affordable Pixel flagship,"With the Pixel 5, Google is taking a different approach to smartphones: there's no 2020 flagship from the tech giant, as there was in 2019 with the high-end Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. Instead, we have an upper-to-mid-ranger that's on sale for a more affordable price.It means Google isn't directly going up against the likes of Samsung, Apple and Huawei at the very top end of the premium smartphone spectrum, where handsets cost a substantial chunk of money and look every bit as expensive and as packed with power as they are.Given the times we're living through, that's perhaps sensible – but it also means it's less easy to distinguish the Pixel 5 from the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 4a, which are both very fine phones. Google is packing the mid-range with more handsets than it perhaps needs.In this Google Pixel 5 review we'll take you through everything you need to know about the phone, from the quality of that famous Pixel camera, to what you can expect from the battery life. That should help you figure out whether or not this is the best phone for you.The Pixel 5 is out and available now, yours for £599 in the UK and $699 in the US – you can buy it direct and SIM-free from the Google Store, as well as from third-party retailers. In the UK, it's also available on a variety of pay monthly contract details from the likes of O2, Vodafone, EE and Three.The Pixel 5 comes sporting a 6-inch screen, which is smaller than a lot of high-end phones these days. The OLED, HDR10+ screen runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz and a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels – it's fluid, sharp, bright and difficult to find fault with. A single punch hole notch for the selfie camera sits up in the top left-hand corner, while the bezels are nice and thin all the way around the screen.As for the rest of the design, the aluminium metal body is covered with a matte texture that feels almost like plastic – it's pleasant to hold, and makes a difference from the shiny, slippy glass that you tend to get at the more expensive end of the smartphone market. Like Pixels gone by, the Pixel 5 isn't flashy or particularly premium in terms of its looks and build, but it's solid and appealing nevertheless.Around the back the dual-lens camera is up in the top left-hand corner, and there's a fingerprint sensor here too. It's a shame that Google has ditched the advanced face recognition technology of the Pixel 4 phones, presumably to save costs – having your phone immediately unlock and go straight to the last app you were using was one of our favourite features of last year's Google handsets, though you'd hardly say it's essential.You can buy the Google Pixel 5 in a simple black or a much more interesting sage colour – though the latter seems in short supply at the moment. The phone is officially IP68-rated, which means it's able to survive being submerged in water at a depth of 1.5 metres (nearly 5 feet) for up to 30 minutes, which gives you some extra peace of mind. There's no headphone jack here, just a USB-C port.Ever since the first Pixel, these phones have shone in terms of photo-taking – not in the raw specs, but in the quality of the image processing that Google is able to apply through its software. That continues with the Pixel 5, though it drops the Neural Core processor from the Pixel 4 handsets, which means the processing takes longer. The Pixel 5 also ditches the 2x optical zoom telephoto lens, opting for an ultrawide instead.The 12.2MP+16MP camera setup in operation here isn't a huge leap forward from the configuration we saw in the Pixel 4 or indeed the Pixel 3, but it does the job very well indeed. Photos are again excellent, with sharpness, colour reproduction, detail and dynamic range all impressing. Cameras on other phones have more lenses and more tricks – and Google's competitors are definitely catching up – but Pixel photography remains the high bar for images that look great and are effortless to take.As with previous models, the Night Sight mode can do wonders for dark photos (if you can keep your phone still for a second or two) – our only complaint would be that it makes some shots look unnaturally bright. Unless you're trying to shoot in the pitch darkness though, your low light shots will come out with plenty of detail and colour, especially when it comes to close-up photos.The Pixel 5 offers 18W charging and wireless charging. In our standard two-hour video streaming text on maximum brightness, the 4080 mAh battery dropped from 100 percent to 78 percent, suggesting around 9-10 hours overall. In day-to-day use, the phone keeps its charge well, with some battery left in the tank by the end of the night even if you've been using it constantly throughout the day.The Pixel 5 supports 5G and runs on a very respectable mid-range Snapdragon 765G processor from Qualcomm, which is paired with an ample 8GB of RAM and a reasonable 128GB of internal storage (with no memory card expansion slot). These aren't the best specs you'll find on an Android phone this year, but they're more than enough for everyday use, even if you do have to wait a beat or two extra for demanding games and complex webpages to load.From gaming to photo editing to email, we didn't notice any lag or stutter from the Pixel 5 during our time testing it. The Geekbench 5 scores that it recorded in our tests – 526 for single-core, 1497 for multi-core, and 1035 for OpenCL – also indicate a phone that's not quite top of the ladder in terms of performance but still very capable. For comparison, the same Snapdragon 765G chip runs the OnePlus Nord and the Nokia 8.3 5G, which are both cheaper than the Pixel 5.The Pixel 5 display and stereo speakers work well for watching shows and movies, and although the screen isn't huge, it's perfectly fine as a media player. You get all the Google apps preinstalled of course, plus a couple of useful Pixel exclusives – including a Recorder tool that can transcribe spoken text in real time for you (useful if you need to record an interview, phone call or lecture, for example).Besides the cameras, the clean software has always been one of the best reasons to buy a Pixel phone, and nothing has changed this time around. You're guaranteed to get Android updates before anyone else for the next couple of years, and there isn't anything in the way of bloatware or unnecessary apps. It's perhaps not the most exciting version of Android you can find, but it is the leanest and most focused.Google hasn't aimed too high with the Pixel 5, and while we miss some of the features of the Pixel 4 – Face Unlock, the top-tier CPU, the telephoto zoom – the new phone does come in at a more affordable price, which we think will be an acceptable trade-off for most people, especially in 2020. Comparisons with last year's flagships aside, this is a well-built, speedy phone with an excellent camera and software, and very good battery life.Perhaps the biggest problem for the Pixel 5 is the cheaper Pixel 4a 5G – that phone has a bigger screen, the same processor, a little bit less RAM, no 90Hz refresh rate and slightly inferior materials in return for a saving of £100 in the UK or $200 in the US. That price vs performance calculation makes the Pixel 4a 5G arguably the better value phone.The reasons you would buy a Pixel phone continue to be the reasons you would buy a Pixel 5: primarily, speedy Android updates for the next 3 years, a bloat-free software experience with some nice Google-y tweaks, and a camera that's going to outperform most of the others on the market at the moment. You can also say that about the Pixel 4a 5G though, and indeed the slower and cheaper Pixel 4a.Where the Pixel 5 earns its price premium is in the aluminium metal finish, the 90Hz refresh rate on the screen, and the IP68 rating for better waterproofing – they're features that we appreciate for sure, but they might not be worth the extra cost to you. All in all, the strengths of the Pixel phones remain the same here, and whether the Pixel 5 is the right Pixel for you really depends on how much you want to spend.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/google-pixel-5
70,OnePlus 8T,OnePlus 8T review: another winner from OnePlus,"The OnePlus 8T sees OnePlus on a roll. We've already had the excellent OnePlus 8, OnePlus 8 Pro and OnePlus Nord this year, and the OnePlus 8T is closing out 2020 in style as well – but how does this new flagship stack up against the rest of the competition?Our OnePlus 8T review will tell you exactly that – we've been using the phone for a couple of weeks to test it in all the key categories. From OnePlus 8T battery life to the internal specs of the OnePlus 8T, this comprehensive review should answer all of your questions.Price-wise, the OnePlus 8T is in that very crowded part of the phone market where the upper-to-mid-range phones sit, but in terms of specs and quality it's actually better than that – which is really how OnePlus first made its name in the industry back in 2014.You do miss out on a few goodies, including full IP68 waterproofing and wireless charging, but you definitely get a lot of smartphone for your money with the OnePlus 8T. Read on to discover everything you need to know about the phone and what it's got to offer.The OnePlus 8T is out and available to buy now SIM-free in the UK from a variety of retailers, though it isn't yet available on contract. Check the pricing widgets on this page for the latest offers, but you're typically looking at around £550 for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage edition, and £650 for the 12GB RAM/256GB storage edition. In the US, only the second of those two configurations is available at the moment, and that will set you back in the region of $750.OnePlus knows how to make a great-looking smartphone, that's hardly a secret – and in this case the impressive aesthetics start with a 6.55-inch, 1,080 x 2,400 resolution, HDR10+ AMOLED display. Colours are bright, details are sharp, and scrolling is super-smooth thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus continues to put out some of the best displays in the business as far as our eyes can tell, and the OnePlus 8T display is fantastic for everything from watching movies to playing mobile games.Elsewhere the design of the phone is very appealing, albeit not much different to what we've seen before from the OnePlus brand. The rear camera shifts to the top left of the back casing – like the OnePlus Nord and unlike the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro – and your colour choices are Aquamarine Green or Lunar Silver, both of which we like (the one we had to review was the former).Around the front of the device the display bezels are pleasingly thin, with a punch hole selfie camera notch up in the top left-hand corner of the screen. There's no headphone jack on this handset, but you do get dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support. As usual there's a dedicated mute switch on the side, together with the volume and power buttons – it's a OnePlus staple that we wish more phone makers would copy.The phone is just 8.4 mm (0.33 inches) thick, a little thicker than the OnePlus 8 and a little thinner than the OnePlus 8 Pro. In fact, that's a good way to think about the OnePlus 8T overall – sitting in between the previous two flagships from April. Overall we've got no complaints about the design and build of the phone, and it feels very much like a flagship.The OnePlus 8T comes equipped with a four camera setup on the back: 48MP wide + 16MP ultrawide + 5MP macro + 2MP depth are the cameras involved. While it's not up there with the very best phone cameras on the market – there's no optical zoom, for example – the rear camera array is certainly no slouch, and it's going to get you some very good photos in most situations (including at night).The ultrawide lens is of course very welcome for fitting more into a particular shot, while colours come across as well balanced and details are crisp and clear up to an impressive level of zoom. The night mode can be a little hit and miss, but it's more hits than misses, and being able to get usable shots in the dark is very welcome. Shutter speed is fast too, and for most people the camera setup won't disappoint.The OnePlus 8T is also one of the first handsets to push fast charging speeds up to 65W, which means you can get a full charge from virtually nothing in just half an hour. No wireless charging is a shame, but the fast charging speeds are good enough to completely change your charging habits – there's no need to keep your phone plugged in overnight when you can just juice it up in 15-minute bursts during the day.Otherwise battery life is great on the OnePlus 8T. It deploys some tricks to keep standby battery drain down to an absolutely minimum, and our two-hour video streaming test – at maximum display brightness by the way – knocked the battery down from 100 percent to just 90 percent, an excellent score. In day-to-day use the OnePlus 8T will easily get you through a whole day on a single charge, and unless you're using a lot of high-powered apps in the day (think GPS navigation and games), you won't need a recharge.The OnePlus 8T comes equipped with a Snapdragon 865 processor – the best Android chip in the business this year, except for the Snapdragon 865 Plus. You also get 8GB or 12GB of RAM, and 128GB or 256GB of internal storage (with no option to extend that via a memory card). It's also worth noting, aside from a slight improvement in the type of flash storage used, that these specs exactly match the OnePlus 8 and the OnePlus 8 Pro.As you would expect, the phone absolutely zips along no matter what you're trying to do with it – multiple browser tabs and demanding games are absolutely no problem for the OnePlus 8T. During the time that we had it, we didn't see any issues with lag or sluggishness, and the Geekbench 5 scores of 880 (single-core), 3137 (multi-core) and 3169 (OpenCL) bear that out.As is the standard now, 5G is on board, and that makes it ready to access the top-tier speeds that are now rolling out in selected cities across the world. 4G is still more than enough for most people most of the time, but it's good to know that the OnePlus 8T is going to last you several years.The phone comes with OxygenOS 11, and the software has long been one of our favourite alternatives to the stock Android that Google puts on its Pixels – it's well designed, it's subtle rather than flashy, and it has a lot of good ideas built into it. With the OnePlus 8T, those ideas extend to an always on display that you can customise in a variety of clever ways – with calendar events and media player status, for example.OnePlus has launched three major phones this year – the OnePlus 8, the OnePlus 8 Pro, and the OnePlus Nord – and the OnePlus 8T is sort of a mix of all of them. It has the design cues of the Nord, and the power of the OnePlus 8 phones, and it's not quite as well specced as its predecessor the OnePlus 8 Pro (though the Pro model is also more expensive, don't forget).The lack of any substantial jump from the phones that came before it is a bit underwhelming, but of course as it's later in the year, OnePlus can now put all of these components together at a cheaper price – and the asking price of the OnePlus 8T is one of the best things about it. Unfortunately for OnePlus, there are plenty of other great phones around at this price point, including the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.All of which might make it sound like we're ambivalent about the OnePlus 8T whereas in fact we love it. The price is super-competitive – especially in the UK – and in return for your money you get a brilliantly designed phone, stacks of power, a gorgeous screen, battery life that impresses, incredible charging speeds and a camera that's going to get you really good shots most of the time. When you look at it that way, it doesn't matter so much that it's not a huge upgrade over the OnePlus 8.We only have five levels of star rating to pick from, so don't let the maximum score here give the impression that this is a perfect phone – you don't get wireless charging, and other phones beat it on camera quality – but for how much money you're paying this is undoubtedly one of the best smartphones on the market at the moment. The only question is whether the OnePlus Nord or OnePlus 8 Pro might be better for you.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-8t
71,Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G,Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G review: a premium mid-ranger with a punch,"The Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G is a decently specced mid-to-upper-range phone, jumping into what is an increasingly crowded and competitive part of the market – you can pick up classy handsets such as the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE for a similar sort of price to this.The newly launched iPhone 12 mini comes in at the same price point too, so you can see the sort of competition that the Oppo handset is up against – even with 5G on board and a good mix of internal specs, it needs to stand out to tempt you away from the alternatives.Besides 5G, the main draw here is the 65W fast charging that we've also seen from OnePlus this year and previous Oppo phones. It gives you a full charge from zero in just 30 minutes or thereabouts, which could make a big difference in the way that you use your phone.In this Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G review we'll take you through how the phone scores in all the key categories that matter: the design, the performance, the battery life, the camera quality, and more besides. It should help you decide whether this is the phone for you.The Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G is available to buy now and from a whole host of retailers and networks as well: SIM-free and contract-free the phone will set you back £699 from Amazon, Carphone Warehouse or Oppo's own online store, but it's also available with deals from EE, Vodafone, O2 and Virgin Mobile. Oppo has yet to officially put its phones on sale in the US, so you can't buy it direct from there.As has usually been the case with Oppo phones of the past, the Reno 4 Pro 5G is a fine-looking device, dominated by its 6.55-inch screen. There are thin bezels all round, with just a punch hole notch to interrupt the display, placed up in the top left-hand corner. Around the back, the camera array is also up in the top left corner. The fingerprint sensor is located under the display itself.The display is definitely one of the best parts of the overall Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G experience: running at a resolution of 1,080 x 2,400 pixels, the AMOLED, HDR10+ panel is bright and sharp and a pleasure to use. It's also smooth in terms of scrolling and animations, with a 90Hz refresh rate that is better than a lot of phones at this price point (though not the absolutely best around of course). The screen curves at the sides, giving you an immersive effect, and just about everything you pull up on this display looks great.The phone feels like a premium piece of hardware when you pick it up and hold it in your hands, and it also feels like it's been carefully put together and built. There are some very nicely designed phones in the mid-range smartphone market at the moment, but the OnePlus Reno 4 Pro 5G definitely holds its own – and we like the Space Black and Galactic Blue colour options as well.As is often the case with mid-rangers, the phone doesn't offer an IP68 rating for waterproofing and dustproofing. There is support for a dual SIM, while charging and data transfer is of course handled via USB-C. You don't get a 3.5 mm headphone jack with this handset, so you may have to upgrade your headphones at the same time as you're upgrading your smartphone.The Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G comes sporting a triple-lens 48MP+13MP+12MP rear camera, combining both an ultrawide mode, 2x optical zoom and 5x hybrid optical zoom – it's not often that you get both ultrawide and optical zoom together at this price. There's a 32MP selfie camera on the front and some neat stabilisation technology for recording videos – the maximum video resolution is 4K at 30 frames per second.On the whole you're going to get photos that you would expect from a phone at this point – crisp, detailed and punchy. They do occasionally come across as oversaturated, but it's not a huge issue. The photos that we took while out and about with the phone were more than good enough for some social media posting and indeed another level above that – it's not the best phone camera around by any means, but we were pleasantly surprised at how well it did.Performance in low light and at night is good too, thanks to the dedicated night mode on board the phone: you can get a longer exposure as long as you hold the phone still for a couple of seconds. It can brighten up the darkest of photos to acceptable levels, but it's not quite as impressive as the night performance on phones by Google and Huawei.In our standard two-hour video streaming test – at maximum brightness and a low volume – the Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G logged an impressively small drop of 12 percent from a full charge to 88 percent. That suggests about 16-17 hours of video streaming, which is very decent indeed. In day-to-day use, it wasn't so great, but provided enough juice to make it through the day. The 4,000 mAh battery supports super-speedy 65W fast charging (like the OnePlus 8T) but there's no wireless charging support on this phone.The Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G specs list looks like this: a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage (with no memory card slot to expand that). In terms of the chipset at least, that puts this phone on a par with the likes of the OnePlus Nord and the Google Pixel 5 – it's a mid-range processor, but it's going to be capable of tackling anything you want to throw at it.In the Geekbench 5 benchmarks that we ran, the phone scored a respectable 606 (single-core), 1780 (multi-core) and 1253 (OpenCL). That's not bad at all, and the difference in performance with the very best phones on the market isn't gigantic – you might just notice a few milliseconds of extra loading time here and there, whether you're playing the most intense games or switching between dozens of browser tabs.As the name suggests, the phone comes with 5G on board, so you're future-proofed against the network upgrades that may or may not be happening in your area. At this sort of price though, we would expect 5G to be included nowadays, and you can actually get the next-gen connectivity feature on phones that cost much less.The ColorOS that Oppo puts on top of Android (it's Android 10 in this case) isn't one of our favourites, but there are no glaring problems with it – it's just a bit fiddly and a bit over-the-top for our tastes. We prefer a clean, stock version of Android, but you might prefer ColorOS, and it certainly isn't going to cause you any major problems. As this is Android, you can always change the look of the software with a launcher anyway.The Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G is a really nice phone, there's no question about that. It's also a relatively expensive phone, and it's up against some very strong competition too – for £100 less you can bag yourself a Google Pixel 5 and for £100 more you can get a foot on the iPhone 12 ladder. That's just two of many other phones circling this price point.When you start running through the features, the phone is definitely worth its asking price: it has an excellent screen and good build quality, the performance levels are decent, and the camera is relatively impressive. That 65W fast charging is a genuine game changer – no more overnight charging needed – and of course there's 5G.The question is whether other phones around this price offer a better overall package. We're not that convinced by the software on board the Oppo Reno 4 Pro 5G, and you miss out on features such as waterproofing and wireless charging. These aren't massive issues really – there are no major problems – but they give you reasons to pick something else instead of this.Ultimately, if you like the design of this Oppo handset and it falls within your price range, it's a good choice for your next smartphone – it's certainly not going to let you down in any of the key areas. Just be sure to weigh up everything that the competition is able to offer before parting with your money.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oppo-reno-4-pro-5g
72,Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro,Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro review: a seriously powerful Android smartphone,"The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro is another flagship-level phone from the Chinese manufacturer, as it looks to gain even more market share outside of its home country. It follows on from the superb Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro from last year, and fits alongside the other Mi 10 phones of 2020.It's not a terribly easy range to figure out – there are several different-but-similar Mi 10 phones to pick from, with and without the T attached (though the T denotes the newer models), and then there are the Note models to take into consideration as well...It's perhaps easier to look at the prices to understand where each phone sits in the Xiaomi Mi 10 range. This Mi 10T Pro hasn't been given a UK price (or launch date) yet, but costs €599 in European markets – that works out at roughly £545, so mid-to-upper-range pricing.That's a very reasonable cost for what are some flagship-level specs, but Xiaomi has always been about offering top-notch quality at a price much lower than the Samsungs and Apples of this world. Read on for plenty more in our full Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro review.As we've said, the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro costs €599 in European markets – Xiaomi is unlikely to use a direct price currency conversion if and when it brings the phone to the UK, but we're talking a cost that's a little more than phones like the iPhone SE 2020 and the OnePlus Nord. As soon as we know pricing and availability for the UK, we'll let you know – if previous Xiaomi phones are any indication, it's likely that you'll be able to buy the phone direct from Xiaomi as well as from third-party sellers such as Amazon.The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro is a big, slightly chunky phone, with a 6.67-inch, 1,080 x 2,400 pixel, IPS LCD display running at a rather impressive 144Hz – though it does adapt the refresh rate depending on what you're doing. It should give you a super-smooth experience when scrolling, gaming and watching movies, and we can confirm that's the case: this is a phone that keeps up the tradition of excellent Xiaomi displays.Besides the 144Hz refresh rate, brightness and contrast are excellent, with the phone displaying punchy colours and clarity that make using it a pleasure. The only disruption to the screen is a single punch hole notch in the top left-hand corner as you look at it, and we're pleased to see the bezels around the display are as thin and unobtrusive as they should be on top-end phones these days.The volume and power buttons are down the right-hand side of the device, and the power button has a fingerprint sensor built into it – we actually prefer having these sensors on the back of phones (or under the display), but you may disagree. At the back there's quite a significant camera bump. The phone's colour options are Cosmic Black, Lunar Silver and Aurora Blue.As usual with Xiaomi, there are a few compromises – no IP68 waterproof rating is one – but taken as a whole we're pretty impressed with the build quality and the materials on offer with the Mi 10T Pro. It's a large phone for sure, but it's been put together well, and it comes with a gorgeous screen attached.The main sensor on the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro's rear camera is a 108MP affair – that's a huge amount of megapixels, though the phone groups them together, so they won't all appear in your photos. That main lens is joined by a 13MP ultrawide lens and a 5MP macro lens to make three cameras in all. There's no optical zoom here, perhaps another nod towards getting the phone down to a very respectable price, but otherwise the phone offers some decent camera specs. The front-facing selfie camera comes in at 20 megapixels.The snaps the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro takes are actually very good – darker and lighter areas are handled well, detail is retained well even on close inspection, and colours are well balanced. There does seem to be a bit of oversaturation going on with the default settings, but it's something we can live with, and we're not going to mark the phone down too much for that. Both close-ups and wide angle shots come out looking fine, and the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro has a perfectly capable camera for all your social media shots.The phone's rear camera also performs well in low light situations, with a night mode that manages to boost the brightness and illuminate a scene quite well – though you do need to be able to keep the phone very steady for a few seconds to get the best results. It's not the best low light performer we've ever seen, but it should be able to get some very usable shots for you most of the time.Xiaomi has packed in a 5,000 mAh battery here, but battery life is good rather than amazing – the big screen and 144Hz refresh rate might have something to do with that. A two-hour video streaming test (at maximum brightness) knocked the battery down from 100 percent to 84 percent, suggesting around 12 hours of streaming altogether. That's a very respectable figure and this should see you through a day and then some. 33W fast charging is on board, though there's no wireless charging.The Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro certainly comes with plenty of power packed inside – thanks to a Snapdragon 865 processor, 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage (which you can't add to with a memory card), the phone can hold its own against anything else on the market. In terms of power versus price, it might be one of the best value Android phones you can buy at the moment.In day-to-day use we haven't noticed any sluggishness or slowing down – the phone speeds along just as quickly as you would expect. The phone posts impressive Geekbench 5 scores of 914 (single-core), 3371 (multi-core) and 3220 (OpenGL), so we'd suggest that this handset is going to last you a good number of years before there's any reason to upgrade it. Games, web browsing, image editing... the phone coped with it all nicely.The stereo speakers do a good job for movies, podcasts and the like, though they're not anything special as far as phones go, and there's no headphone jack. Data transfer and charging is handled by a USB-C slot, and we're pleased to see support for the latest Wi-Fi 6 standard included. Like most phones at this point, the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro also comes with 5G on board, which is a bonus if next-gen connectivity has rolled out to your area.As usual, Xiaomi slaps its MIUI software on top of Android (Android 10 in this case), and while there's nothing particularly wrong with it, we prefer the clean simplicity of stock Android – there are fewer apps and menu screens and settings to wade through. Xiaomi is by no means the worst in the software department, but it isn't our favourite either.We're big fans of the way Xiaomi puts its phones together and the prices that it sells them at, and there's a lot to like about the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro – it's well designed, it has an impressive screen, it comes carrying some of the best specs you'll see on an Android phone this year, and the camera and battery life won't let you down either.Then there's the price: we don't know this for sure as far as the UK goes, but based on what the phone sells for in Europe, this looks set to be a very good handset in terms of value for money. If you need 5G in a well-priced phone that scores highly in most of the key categories, then the Mi 10T Pro is worth a spot on your shortlist.So why might you pick something else? Well, you can buy phones with better aesthetics and better cameras, and you can get 5G for less. Spend more, and you'll get extras like waterproofing, wireless charging and telephoto zoom. There are a lot of very good handsets to choose from at the moment – and quite a few of them are made by Xiaomi itself, in fact.Everything considered, the Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro is another example of the ability Xiaomi has to build top-quality phones at very appealing prices. While it might not quite be the most impressive handset that it's ever put out, it's definitely an option if you want your money to stretch as far as possible.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-mi-10t-pro
73,Realme 7 Pro,Realme 7 Pro review: another compelling budget phone from Realme,"The Realme 7 Pro shows Realme continuing to push out decent quality phones that are very affordable – it's been in this game a few years (as the '7' suggests), and it's getting good at it too. Here we'll take a look at one of its new offerings in all the key categories.The Realme 7 Pro arrives alongside the even cheaper Realme 7 – check that phone out if you want to spend even less and don't mind a drop in performance and camera quality in return – and can be picked up unlocked right now in the UK for not much money at all.The starting price for the phone is just £279, which undercuts even affordable mid-rangers like the iPhone SE 2020 and the Google Pixel 4a by some distance. The question is whether you get enough back in return – which we'll look at in this detailed Realme 7 Pro review.With even top-tier phone makers putting out more affordable handsets in recent years, buying budget no longer necessarily means settling for poor performance and sub-par build quality, but there's still a balance to be struck between price and everything else.Your only option for buying the Realme 7 Pro is buying direct, either from Realme or from Amazon, for £279. The phone doesn't go on sale until October 13, but you can book your preorders in with Realme in advance if you want to. For the time being, Realme isn't selling its phones in the US.We've got absolutely no complaints about the Realme 7 Pro from a design perspective. Sure, the likes of the top-tier iPhones and Galaxys are better looking, but this phone is very nicely designed for its price point – it has a bit of a cheap, plastic feel to it, but it's not a handset that you're going to be embarrassed to pull out at family gatherings. It features an in-screen fingerprint sensor too, which helps keep the rest of the design nice and clean.The 6.4-inch, 1080 x 2400 OLED display is really appealing, with thin bezels (the chin is slightly thicker) and excellent brightness and contrast levels – it's a better screen than you might expect for this amount of money. There's just a standard 60Hz refresh rate, but that's no problem really (the Realme 7 offers 90Hz, but via the slightly inferior LCD display technology). Movies, games, websites and more all look great on this display.Certain compromises have to be made on budget phones of course, and the Realme 7 Pro is no exception. You don't get an IP68 rating for waterproofing, for example – it's just listed as having a ""water-repellent coating"" instead. We are pleased to see a 3.5mm headphone jack here though, which means you can bring along your old wired headphones without having to fork out for a wireless pair.Thankfully even budget phones are using USB-C now, and the Realme 7 Pro is one of them. It's available in rather fetching blue or silver colours (the back casing has a neat shimmer effect), and there's support for a dual SIM setup here as well. There's even a memory card slot if you want to boost the amount of on-board storage.The Realme 7 Pro comes rocking a quad-lens, 64MP wide + 8MP ultrawide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera on the back, and a 32MP wide selfie camera on the front – perfectly fine specs on paper, but camera quality is one of the areas where you can tell this is a phone towards the lower end of the price spectrum. It's by no means terrible, but it's not on a par with the mid-range phones that cost a little bit more.You'll have absolutely no problems taking photos for social media and casual sharing around friends and family – the resolution is good, most details are sharp in good lighting conditions, and colours are reasonably well reproduced. The ultrawide lens is really handy too, if you feel you need to fit even more into a scene. As we've said, it's not a bad rear camera, it's just that better ones are available.Low light performance is a bit hit and miss – you can get some decent shots, but sometimes the night mode processing seems to go a bit awry. Still, when you're comparing this camera against the cameras on other phones at the same price, the Realme 7 Pro can definitely hold its head up high. The shots you get won't let you down most of the time, and that's fair enough from our perspective.Battery life is one area where the Realme 7 Pro really excels – the 4,500mAh battery packed in here can run and run, and we were getting well into a second day with medium usage on a single charge. Our two-hour video streaming test at maximum brightness knocked the battery down from 100 percent to just 90 percent (suggesting 20 hours of streaming total), and while wireless charging is absent, the phone also packs in cutting edge 65W fast charging tech that can get you a full charge in a little over half an hour.The internal specs of the Realme 7 Pro won't wow you, but they might not disappoint you either considering the price of the handset: a Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of internal storage. We've definitely run Android on worse than that in the past, so it's a decent offering (you get Android 10 out of the box, with the Realme UI slathered on top).In terms of performance, Geekbench scores of 570 (single-core), 1784 (multi-core), and 1245 (OpenCL) tell you that this is not a phone that's going to blow you away in terms of performance. It's not a terrible set of results though, running just behind something like the OnePlus Nord mid-ranger, and it's definitely enough to do everything you want to do on your phone (albeit at a slightly slower speed).Benchmarks only tell part of the story of course, and in day-to-day use the Realme 7 Pro is perfectly slick and snappy. Only a few extra milliseconds delay when jumping between multiple apps, or loading demanding games, or opening up complex websites tell you that you're not running the very best silicon under the hood here. Gamers might want a bit more in terms of frame rates, but for most people it's fine.At this price, you don't get 5G, which is worth bearing in mind considering that a lot of mid-rangers come with the tech now (the Moto G 5G Plus can be had for around the £300 mark). That won't trouble a lot of people shopping at this price point, and 4G is certainly going to be good enough for the next few years while 5G networks roll out more widely. Audio is provided by stereo speakers built into the casing, and it's perfectly adequate.Summing up phones is always a bit tricky because we don't know what your budget is or what exactly you want from a phone. Obviously the Realme 7 Pro isn't as powerful, as well built or as good in the photography department as the iPhone 11 – but it's around a third of the price of Apple's handset. It all depends what you're looking for.With the Realme 7 Pro, it's a case of come for the affordability, and stay for the rather decent performance, camera quality, and design – and for the excellent battery life. If you don't want to spend very much on your next smartphone but still want something that'll impress, then get the Realme 7 Pro on your shortlist. This isn't the first excellent budget handset Realme has put out, and it's getting very good at it.We have minor reservations: a little bit more money can get you a lot more phone, because the mid-range is so strong at the moment. We're also not huge fans of the Realme UI software, which is a bit flamboyant and loud for our tastes – we'd much prefer something closer to stock Android (as you get on the superb budget Nokia handsets), but your mileage may vary as far as software goes.Both the Realme 7 Pro and the Realme 7 give thrifty smartphone shoppers something new to think about, and as it gets increasingly difficult to justify the cost of the very top-end flagship smartphones, Realme and its competitors have a good chance of carving our a niche down at the affordable end of the market. An impressive all-round package – for the price.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/realme-7-pro
74,Xiaomi Redmi 9,Xiaomi Redmi 9 review: Xiaomi can make impressive budget phones too,"With the Xiaomi Redmi 9 we find ourselves most definitely down at the budget end of Xiaomi's smartphone offerings, and like any phone at this price, it's all about how much you're paying (or rather saving) – everything else should be weighed up against that price.Bear in mind that buying a budget phone isn't the disaster that it once was. Smartphone tech has now evolved to the point where even the cheapest handsets can just about do a job, with performance and features that are going to satisfy the majority of users.And so it is with the Redmi 9 – while it obviously lags behind the mid-rangers and flagships of this world in just about every category, it's also very affordable, and at this sort of price you do start to wonder whether you do really need a fancy night mode for the camera.We've been spending a few days in the company of the Xiaomi Redmi 9 and you can read our thoughts below. Considering the growing reputation of Xiaomi outside of its Chinese home, this is definitely worth considering if you're in the market for a budget handset.The Xiaomi Redmi 9 is available now to buy in the UK at retailers including Amazon. Check the widgets on this page for the latest pricing and the best deals on the web, but at the time of writing you can pick up the phone for around £170 without a contract and SIM-free. It's also available direct from Xiaomi.We say this about a lot of budget phones, so maybe we need to adjust our expectations, but here it is again: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 looks more expensive than it actually is. We're very much fans of the textured backing that Xiaomi has used here, which is made of plastic but has a distinctly premium feel. The plastic, and the thicker bezels, and the slightly thick casing give the game away that this is a budget phone, but it still looks stylish enough.We're impressed with the screen too, a 6.53-inch IPS LCD affair that runs at a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels and an unspecified refresh rate (none of that fancy 90Hz or 120Hz speed here, not at this price). It's bright and sharp, and perfectly good for watching YouTube videos or scrolling through the expanses of the web. It's one of the better displays we've seen on a phone down at this end of the price scale.The top of the screen is interrupted with a small teardrop notch, which looks a little outdated these days, but the bezels around the side of the display aren't so big that they're off-putting. The fingerprint sensor is round the back below the camera module, which is just about our favourite place to have a fingerprint sensor (at least until manufacturers work out how to put it under the screen).You don't usually get waterproofing or dustproofing with phones that cost so little, and so it is with the Redmi 9. Data and charging is via USB-C, and you get a good old 3.5mm headphone jack as well as a single speaker. It's worth mentioning that the Corning Gorilla Glass used to protect the screen isn't up to the very latest standard, but it's still going to be enough to survive most bumps and knocks. Carbon Grey, Sunset Purple and Ocean Green are your three colour choices.These days most budget phones tend to pack in multiple cameras and fancy software features to make up for the fact that they're not actually that good – and in that vein the Redmi 9 comes with a quad-lens 13MP wide + 8MP ultrawide + 5MP macro + 2MP depth rear camera. Despite all of those different cameras, you're not going to get results that match up to the mid-rangers that cost a little bit more.Most shots come out looking fine though, especially in good lighting. The focus and shutter speed is a little slow, but we were happy with most of the pictures we took in the great outdoors, and an ultrawide lens is always welcome. The 8MP selfie camera on the front is okay too, provided you're just taking photos for social media and your family's chat group rather than for photo canvases that are going to go up in the living room.Low light performance isn't great, though the Redmi 9 will make an effort at trying to get something usable out of dark scenes. Details get lost and noise creeps in, and if night time shots are going to be important to you then maybe save up for a bit longer to get something more capable in this department than the Redmi 9.Battery life is good, on the whole – we tended to have plenty of juice left in the tank at the end of the day, and if you're careful you might get two days between charges. Our two-hour video streaming test at maximum screen brightness knocked the battery level down from 100 percent to 83 percent, which equals an impressive 11 or 12 hours of video streaming before the battery will give out completely. The larger-than-normal capacity of 5,020 mAh no doubt helps here.The internal specs is where the Redmi 9 cuts some corners to hit its price: the Mediatek Helio G80 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage is only a little bit above the bare minimum for getting Android to run properly (a 3GB and 32GB version is also available, which we'd avoid). Apps and menus take a few milliseconds longer to open up than they would on a mid-range phone, and the handset can really start to slow down if you switch between too many apps to quickly.Complex websites that are heavy on the visuals can cause the Redmi 9 to stutter, and so can advanced games with fast-paced action and a lot of 3D rendering – everything will run on this phone, just about, but it might not all run smoothly. The low Geekbench 5 scores of 359 (single core), 1331 (multi core) and 1134 (OpenCL) that we got reflect that.It's not unusable by any means though – most tasks are taken care of with no issues on the Redmi 9, and it's fine for social media, checking email, taking a look at the web, and so on. Again, it's all relative compared against the price, and considering you're getting a working smartphone for not much money at all, it's difficult to complain too much.We don't like the MIUI skin that Xiaomi puts on top of Android (Android 10 in this case) all that much, but your mileage may vary – it's just a bit too garish and interfering for our tastes, but there's nothing here that would necessarily put you right off the phone. You do get quite a lot of Xiaomi's own apps on board out of the box, but they're easy enough to uninstall or ignore if you don't like them.It seems like fewer and fewer of us can justify spending flagship money on flagship phones, and with handsets like the Redmi 9 around, you really don't need to – it's a fantastic little budget phone, with a screen and design that impress, and camera quality and performance levels that are good enough for a budget phone.If you've got more money to spend, of course the mid-rangers are better in terms of speed, and display quality, and the sort of results you can get from the camera, while adding features such as 5G and wireless charging. But that doesn't mean the Redmi 9 from Xiaomi doesn't appeal at a significantly lower price point.Every smartphone is a compromise between price and everything else, and when it comes to this handset that's most noticeable in low light camera performance and the overall speed of the device. However, we were perfectly happy using the Redmi 9 as a phone for a few days, with only the occasional moment of frustration at a slowdown.Remember longevity when you're buying a phone – budget phones won't last you as many years as flagships will. We'd also recommend checking out all the other budget phones on the market at the moment, as it's a strong field right now. The Xiaomi Redmi 9 more than holds its own though, and is absolutely worth considering as an affordable pick.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-9
75,Nokia 8.3 5G,Nokia 8.3 5G review: one of the most affordable 5G phones,"The Nokia 8.3 5G won't be any surprise to seasoned Nokia watchers – not only was it announced months before it went on sale, it offers the sort of value-for-money proposition that the brand is known for nowadays, coming in at less than £500 SIM-free in the UK.That's not much money for a phone that has 5G on board and the sort of the specs that the Nokia 8.3 5G can offer, though there's plenty of competition at this price point: the Pixel 4a, the iPhone SE 2020, the OnePlus Nord, the Moto G 5G Plus and several others too.It really comes down to what you want out of a smartphone, and if it's 5G or a decent rear camera then the Nokia 8.3 5G is worth a look (you'll note how many 5G phones continue to trail 5G in the actual name, just in case you were about to forget the tech was on board).Nokia phones like this model have also appealed in their simplicity under the stewardship of HMD Global, joining the Android One programme that ensures a near-stock Android interface, two years of speedy software updates, and three years of security patches.The Nokia 8.3 5G is available to preorder now, with availability from October. You can pick it up in the UK for a little under £500 from the likes of Clove and O2, with a variety of different options available on contract. Over in the US, the pricing has been set at $699 for a SIM-free phone, but that's for the 8GB RAM / 128GB storage model (as opposed to the 6GB RAM / 64GB option in the UK).Nokia-branded phones tend to go in for a kind of simple elegant minimalism these days, and the Nokia 8.3 5G is no different in that respect: it's plain but not unappealing in terms of its aesthetics, a phone that won't turn heads but won't embarrass you if you have to pull it out in front of strangers. It definitely doesn't have the polish and the feel of the very best flagships on the market, but it's still nicely put together.It's absolutely worth a look if you're after a big screen on your next smartphone – the 6.81-inch, 1,080 x 2,400 pixel IPS LCD screen is definitely on the larger side, and like a lot of budget phones that we've seen, there are thin bezels on three sides with a slightly thicker chin down at the bottom. The only blemish on the display is a punch hole notch for the front-facing camera.Overall, the screen is clear and bright and sharp, with no problems in terms of movie watching, web browsing, or doing anything else you might want to do with your smartphone. No, it's not up there with the very best smartphone screens on the market, but for the price you're paying it's perfectly fine. At the sides you've got the volume controls, power button, and a Google Assistant button, if you need it.We're not huge fans of the power button fingerprint sensor that the Nokia 8.3 5G deploys – a sunken power button just feels wrong – but that's more of a subjective assessment, and you may love it. It does at least leave the back of the phone clear for a large, circular camera bump. The greeny-blue Polar Night is your only colour option, and there is a headphone jack alongside a USB-C port and a single speaker. You don't get any waterproofing or dustproofing, which is par for the course at this price.The Nokia 8.3 5G features a quad-lens 64MP wide + 12MP ultrawide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth rear camera, but if you haven't got the memo yet, the number of lenses and the pixel count aren't always an accurate way of gauging camera quality. The Nokia 8.3 5G actually does a decent job with photos, though perhaps not quite as good a job as some of its similarly priced competitors.Photos in daylight and good lighting are bright and sharp, with excellent colour balance and plenty of sharpness and detail. As an added bonus, the shutter speed is quick too. If you're snapping photos throughout the day then we don't think the Nokia 8.3 5G is going to let you down, and we were really happy with most of the photos we got – that ultrawide lens is really handy for fitting more into the frame.It's low light, night time photos where budget cameras tend to slip up, and here the Nokia 8.3 5G is less impressive. It's still okay though, especially if you turn on night mode – this lets you get substantially more detail in darker shots, if you're prepared to put up with several seconds of exposure time, and we found that it improved some of our pictures taken when light was at a premium.In terms of battery, in our two-hour video streaming test, the 4,500 mAh battery on the Nokia 8.3 5G went down from 100 percent to 69 percent, suggesting you'll get around 6 or 7 hours of movie watching out of it – that was with the screen brightness ramped right up though, so a dimmer display would give you extra time between charges. In general, the battery is good for a day but not really much more than that.Under the hood we've got the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor that's proving very popular this year, and that's paired with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage (which you can expand with a memory card). We have seen an 8GB / 128GB mentioned in some quarters, though it hasn't gone on sale yet as far as we can see.Those aren't cutting-edge specs but they're certainly capable of coping with everything a smartphone needs to do – the very top processors and piles of RAM are nice to have, and shave off a few milliseconds of loading time, but you don't really need them (as the number of manufacturers choosing the mid-range Snapdragon 765G has shown). In Geekbench, the Nokia 8.3 5G posted some very respectable scores of 576 (single core), 1529 multi core) and 1259 (OpenCL).You do of course get 5G with this phone – the hint is in the name. Whether it's worth upgrading at this stage is up to you and whether or not you can get 5G where you live: it's definitely the future, but we've been surviving just fine on 4G, and unless you particularly need blazing fast speeds or an ultra-reliable connection at all times, we don't think it's a must-have right now. If you do want it, the Nokia 8.3 5G is one of your cheapest options.The phone arrives with Android 10 on board, and considering its status as an Android One handset, that should get bumped to Android 11 very soon. The clean, uncluttered, Google-focused version of Android that Nokia phones ship with is one of our favorite things about them, and it's just about as clean an Android experience as you're going to get outside of the Pixel line.Getting 5G at this price is one reason to sit up and take notice of the Nokia 8.3 5G – if the next-gen tech has rolled out in your area, and you like the idea of an ultra-fast, always-on connection, then this could well find a way onto your smartphone shortlist. It's definitely the stand-out feature of the phone, which comes in at an appealing price.Everything else is pretty much standard for the price: the performance, the battery life, the quality of the shots you can get from the camera... it's all good, for the price. You might want to do a bit of shopping around to find the best deal possible (the widgets embedded on this page should help), and if you can find the phone at a discount then it's going to make it a more appealing proposition.As we've said, there are some excellent alternatives – the Pixel 4a is cheaper and takes better photos, and the OnePlus Nord is cheaper and feels like a more premium phone (with a superior screen). Neither of those phones come with 5G on board though, so you can see that you've got a few different factors to weigh up when judging whether or not the Nokia 8.3 5G is the phone for you.In the end the Nokia 8.3 5G is exactly what Nokia is known for – a nicely priced, well-built handset that's got nothing in the way of software bloat and that can take some decent pictures. We would like to give it some extra points for featuring in the latest Bond film, but we can't say whether or not that's going to matter either way to you...",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/nokia-8-3-5g-review
76,Cat S62 Pro,Cat S62 Pro review: a super rugged phone with built-in thermal imaging,"The Cat S62 Pro has two key selling points: the best thermal imaging camera that you can get on a phone, and a toughness rating that's substantially higher than the vast majority of phones on the market. Interested? We've got all you need to know about the smartphone.A thermal camera has more uses than you might think, across DIY and finding your pets in the back garden and troubleshooting technical problems with hardware. That's before you get to all the commercial and industry uses of course, which make it even more useful.Bullitt Group, which licenses the Cat name for these phones, is marketing the S62 Pro as ""the ultimate work phone"", and it's fair to say that most of the people who will be interested in this handset will have some kind of usage scenario in mind for their job.That said, we think the idea of a rugged, go-anywhere phone with one particular superpower is going to appeal more generally too, whatever your occupation – and the phone is reasonably priced as well. Read on to get the full Cat S62 Pro review verdict.The Cat S62 Pro is available to buy now, direct from the Cat phones website or from multiple third-party retailers (including Clove and Laptops Direct in the UK).Check out the widgets on this page for the latest pricing offers and deals, but the official retail price for the phone is £599 in the UK and $749 in the US. That's mid-range pushing upper-range, but the handset does come with some very clever tricks.While the Cat S62 Pro certainly isn't the chunkiest phone we've ever seen, it takes ruggedness and toughness very, very seriously – as well as a top-level IP68 and IP69 rating for waterproofing and dustproofing, the phone also passes the MIL-STD-810 military standard spec for durability and robustness. In real terms, it can survive drops of up to 1.8 meters (6 feet) onto solid steel.We're pleased to say all this extra protection doesn't make the phone look at all ugly. Sure, you can tell it's not a premium flagship in the looks department, but we like what Cat has done with the rubber and metal that encases the S62 Pro. While we were reluctant to throw our review unit around too much, we can say it survived the drops and the submersions we put it through with no problems at all.The screen is one of the most obviously mid-range parts of the Cat S62 Pro: the 5.7-inch, 1080 x 2160 pixel LCD display here isn't as sharp, as bright or as fast as the panels on some of the other phones available at this price point, and it's a long way from the screens on the most expensive flagships on the market. It does the job though, and you have to weigh everything up against the price – and bear in mind that the Cat S62 Pro isn't really trying to sell itself on its screen.Making a phone that's both resilient and aesthetically pleasing isn't easy, but we think the Cat S62 Pro pulls it off rather well. It's a little heavier and thicker than you might be used to – the thickness is 11.9 mm or 0.47 inches – but it's not really a problem. The data and charging port is USB-C, there is a microSD card slot but no headphone jack, and there's also an extra button on the side that you can set up with a custom app shortcut. The phone also has a fingerprint sensor on the back.For its thermal camera, the Cat S62 Pro has turned to industry experts FLIR and its Lepton 3.5 camera – a professional-grade, high-resolution option that is significantly sharper than thermal cameras on previous Cat phones (and on competitor handsets). The camera is accessed not through the usual camera app but through the dedicated FLIR app, and it only takes a few seconds before it's up and running.The camera comes with a whole host of different options to play around with: you can limit the temperature range, and blend the thermal image with the image from the phone's actual camera, and take specific temperature readings, and take pictures with annotations, and change the colour scheme, and more besides. The manufacturer has done a really nice job here, and we're impressed.Aside from the thermal camera, the Cat S62 Pro has a single-lens 12MP snapper on the back – it'll do the basics in terms of smartphone photography but not much more than that. We found that it's capable of getting some good results in decent lighting, but it can't match up to other phone cameras at this price point in terms of sharpness, colour balancing and shooting images in low light.It's a better story with the 4,000 mAh battery, which still had plenty of juice left at the end of each day during our testing. Even if you're making extensive use of the thermal imagery and demanding apps like mapping, we think you'll comfortably make it though a day – maybe two if you're more careful with battery management. In our two-hour video streaming test the battery dropped from full to 77 percent, which works out as about eight hours of streaming overall.In the end it's really all about that thermal imaging camera: if you think you're going to make serious use of it, then the Cat S62 Pro is just about the best in the business at the moment. You get sharp, accurate, high-resolution results, with a ton of customisation and analysis options available inside the software as well.The other reason to buy this phone is its ruggedness – something Cat phones take very seriously. It's going to cope with just about any punishment you can put it through, above and beyond the normal waterproofing and dustproofing that you get on some other phones. Do you need a handset that can go anywhere with you? And take thermal images while you're there? The Cat S62 Pro is an excellent pick.Nothing else from the phone is really going to stand out to you if you're in the market for a new device: the internal specs and the regular camera are rather ordinary, and the quality of the screen isn't going to dazzle you. At the price that the Cat S62 Pro is pitched, there are other phones around that are better value for money if you don't need the special camera and the extra sturdiness.The Cat S62 Pro is one of just a handful of phones offering thermal imaging and extra handset protection in one complete package, and we'd say it's the best we've seen so far – even though there's still plenty of room for improvement. It's a niche product sure, but if you are one of the people working in that niche then you're going to be pleased to have the Cat S62 Pro as your smartphone companion.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/cat-s62-pro
77,Apple iPhone SE (2020),Apple iPhone SE (2020) review: a cheap iPhone that feels premium in almost every way,"Welcome to T3's iPhone SE (2020) review. The new iPhone SE is a long-awaited update to Apple's cheapest iPhone offering, bringing a load of high-end features in a slightly older design.UPDATE: The Apple iPhone SE (2020) has won Best Mid-Range Phone at the T3 Awards 2020.The real trick to the iPhone SE range is that it manages to cut a lot of costs without feeling like it has – you get a full-fat iPhone experience (just about), powered by the latest processor that's also found in the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11.• The best cheap smartphones
• The best iPhone SE (2020) deals
• iPhone SE vs iPhone 11 vs iPhone XRThat chip not only makes the iPhone SE very fast, highly capable and fairly power efficient, it also packs in advanced image processing so that the camera can punch well above its weight for detail and colour reproduction.The three main things people tend to want from a new phone are for it to respond quickly, for it to get better battery life, and for it to take good shots – so let's dig into just how well the iPhone SE achieves those, as well as everything else you need to know about it.Our thanks to Vodafone for supplying our review unit.The iPhone SE (2020) starts from £419/$399 SIM-free with 64GB of storage. You can step up to 128GB of storage for £469/$449, or to 256GB for £569/$549.Apple offers 0% interest payment instalments at its online store, so you can get the phone SIM-free and save some money, but without needing to pay everything upfront. It's the cheapest way to get the new iPhone, and we recommend it if you're happy find your own SIM-only deal to use with it (or are keeping an old SIM).• See Apple UK's payment options for the iPhone SE
• See Apple US's payment options for the iPhone SEFor more casual users, the basic 64GB version should be fine. For someone who takes a ton of photos, or who'll download a lot of games to play or movies to watch, the step up to 128GB is a very good move, and makes a ton of sense for a small extra cost. That would be my choice.The 256GB version feels a little overkill for most people this phone is aimed at – it starts to nudge more towards the mid-range rather than the cheap-end for price. But if you really love to take video and play games and don't want to spend any more than this, it's the one to get.When it comes to design, the iPhone SE gets its looks and build straight from the iPhone 8, which means it feels just as premium as any other iPhone. This isn't like buying a cheap-o phone and getting something plasticky – from the moment you start unpacking it from the box, the glass and aluminium body, and pristine joins and finish, feel like something that costs a lot more.It actually feels even denser than the iPhone 11 Pro, which only adds to the premium impression.It comes in three colours: black, white and red. They all have a black screen and bezels on the front, but the matte aluminium metal sides and the glass back change colour. The black (which we had for testing) is the most uniform of these. The white has silver aluminium edges with the white back, while the red is also fairly uniform (and is a really dramatic, rich red).In terms of size, it's the smallest iPhone by volume comfortably – it's smaller in every dimension than the iPhone 11 Pro, which is the next smallest. But because of the bezels, its overall physical size isn't quite as majorly different from that phone as you might think.It's still noticeably smaller, though, and in the case of the screen particularly, that's important – we'll come to that in the next section.At the bottom of the front is the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, which also functions as a Home button (although it isn't a physical button, which feels a bit odd).At the top of the front is one of the two stereo speakers, plus the forward facing camera. On the sides, you've got a sleep/wake button, a mute switch and volume controls.At the bottom is another speaker, plus the Lightning port, which is the sole physical connection – there's no 3.5mm headphone jack here. And it doesn't come with an adapter, so if you want to use traditional wired headphones, you'll need to buy one. It does comes with Apple's wired Lightning-connected headphones though, as well as a charging cable and wall plug.The new SE is water-resistant at an IP67 rating, which means it can survive a dunking of a maximum depth of 1m for up to 30 mins. Basically, a drop into the bath shouldn't be a problem.The most important thing about the iPhone SE's screen is its size: at 4.7 inches, it's the smallest iPhone screen by a long way. This means it's the most usable for those with smaller hands – and is the only screen those with bigger hands can reach all over without repositioning.We mentioned before that the overall size of the phone isn't that much smaller than the iPhone 11 Pro, but the screen size is majorly smaller. It is simply more usable with one hand, and the trade-off is a little bit of screen real-estate, and a tiny bit of scale.Elements appear just a little smaller on the iPhone SE than they do on the bigger iPhones, but the difference isn't massive – and you can use iOS' accessibility controls to boost things like text size if you need to.But the iPhone SE's screen is also less tall than the bigger iPhones, so you'll see fewer lines of text at the bottom of an website or document on the iPhone SE. We're not criticising it for that – it's a natural trade-off for a screen that's a more reachable size. It's just something to be aware off.The screen otherwise is extremely close to what you get in the iPhone 11 or iPhone XR – the same maximum brightness, the same P3 wide colour gamut, the same contrast.And it looks really great. The colours are accurate, it's good from basically all viewing angles, and the resolution of 750x1334 is sharp at over 300 pixels per inch.It's LCD rather than OLED, so you don't get the super-rich contrast of the screen in the Google Pixel 3a, but we suspect most people who are the target market here won't mind too much about that. It's definitely nicer to have OLED's contrast for watching movies, but this works just fine for videos on Facebook or a quick episode of The Simpsons on Disney+.The screen will wake itself up when you lift the phone, but not when you tap it (unlike other current iPhones).The built-in speakers are pretty good, too – they can go loud without distorting, and when watching a video in landscape, you get a good sense of stereo separation.They're a bit thin, lacking the more bassy end of things in particular for music and movies when compared to more expensive phones, but they do the job well, and are well suited to voices especially, which makes sense.The iPhone SE has a single-lens camera on the back, which Apple describes as the most advanced single-lens snapper on an iPhone ever.It's a wide-angle lens (ie, the normal kind for smartphones) with a 12-megapixel sensor. That makes it sound like it may be on a technical par with the equivalent wide-angle cameras on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, but a teardown by iFixit has revealed that this isn't quite correct.The iPhone SE has a smaller sensor than the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro, despite having the same number of pixels. This has two effects: a smaller sensor receives less light, so won't be quite as strong a performer in dark conditions; and it also means that it will have a slightly different field of view than the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro's camera, because a larger sensor is mounted a different length from the lens. The angle thing isn't something we're worried about – we'll demonstrate it to you below, but it makes little real-world difference.The sensor size is likely to make more of a real-world difference, but as we'll see, the fact that it's still an excellent sensor and is also backed up Apple's latest generation of image processor means that the end result – once the image has come off the sensor and been tweaked automatically in micro-seconds before you ever see it – are hugely impressive.We gave it the hardest test possible, putting it up against the iPhone 11 Pro. Here are the results.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone SE (2020). See a larger version here.The image above is a fairly typical of the difference between the two cameras. First, you might notice that the iPhone SE image is slightly more cropped into the view – that's the different field of view we mentioned above in action.There are subtle differences across the two images in how colours are handled, most notably in the sky. The greens on the 11 Pro's picture are also a little more lush – there's a tad more saturation overall, and also a bit more dynamic range to give shadows and details more depth. You might also spot that the hedge on the right is blurrier on the 11 Pro's image – this isn't using any kind of Portrait Mode, so that's just a stronger natural bokeh.But the main thing you're probably thinking is… they both look great. Both sharp, both natural. The 11 Pro's pic is a little better to our eyes, but not by much. If we want to see any real weakness, we have to jump to a 100% zoom.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone SE (2020). View a version at 100% scale.If we scale both pictures to a 100% view, we can see that the iPhone 11 Pro retains noticeably more sharpness and detail. The iPhone SE's picture is softer, and the reduced contrast makes the flower look less realistic and physical.Now obviously, people don't tend to view a lot of photos at 100% – that we have to go this close to find a major distinction show how good a job the iPhone SE is doing. But with no zoom lens of any kind on the SE, people will find themselves cropping and zooming a fair bit, so it's useful to know where its limitations are in this area.Here's another outdoors shot, and we challenge you to work out which photo is from which phone without looking at the caption…Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone SE (2020). See a larger version.The differences in the shot above are almost entirely academic. Again, the sky is treated differently, but it makes little difference to the quality. At full zoom, we were able to notice a bit of extra contrast in the 11 Pro's pic, along with some sharper blades of grass, but who really cares.Stepping back indoors, we saw similar results to the flower picture.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone SE (2020). See a larger version.The iPhone SE photo doesn't capture the individual fur as crisply and realistically as the 11 Pro does, and again a reduced dynamic range means the cat's black patches don't come out as richly dark as they do in real life.It also hasn't been able to handle the colour balance from the backlighting quite as well – the white wall has a bit of a green hue on the SE's shot.But would you be unhappy with the shot on the right? No, of course not. For a phone that's under half the price, these shots are excellent.This was the trend across the many shots we took – in even outdoor lighting especially, it's really hard to tell the photos apart at all. In harder lighting, the SE starts to look weaker on contrast and colour balance, but still does an admirable job.We also tested the Portrait Mode capabilities of the SE, of course. For this, we brought in the iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 11 Pro, because that makes for the most interesting comparison.Left: iPhone 11. Centre: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone SE. See a larger version.The first thing you might notice above is that the centre image is a much more flattering framing than the other two, which both look like a little like I'm leering in towards the camera. That's because the iPhone 11 and iPhone SE both use a wide-angle lens for this kind of Portrait Mode shot, while the iPhone 11 Pro uses a 2x telephoto zoom lens.As a result, taking this kind of portrait requires getting very close with the the SE and the 11, which means things start to look odd. Anything at the front of the face gets exaggerated, which is mainly the glasses and nose, and the forehead overtakes the hair a bit too. You don't get this problem if you step back more (which is why the 11 Pro doesn't have these issues, since the 2x zoom required our photographer to take several steps backwards while keeping the same framing) but this is a pretty standard framing for a nice portrait shot, so it's a valid comparison.The important part is the quality, though, and all three are essentially on a par. The iPhone 11 and iPhone SE photos actually have marginally sharper details (noticeable in the beard) than the iPhone 11 Pro, which is likely due to the 11 Pro not being able to let as much light in its longer zoom lens.The iPhone SE has a slightly cooler skin tone than the others, but again we likely wouldn't notice if we weren't placing them side by side. And the edge detection and background blurring is hugely impressive on all three.One thing to note is that the iPhone 11 Pro can do Portrait Mode on effectively any subject, the iPhone 11 can do it on people and pets, but the iPhone SE can only do it on humans. You'll just have to take normal photos, sorry.However, the iPhone SE also does Portrait Mode (of humans) from its front camera, too! Let's compare that to the iPhone 11 Pro again.Left: iPhone 11 Pro. Right: iPhone SE (2020). View a version at 100% scale.Hang on, is the iPhone SE picture here actually… better? The beard is a little more defined, and the blackness of the glasses is richer, and they look sharper. The iPhone 11 Pro has done a better job of recreating realistic depth of field as the hair and coat go further back, but you have to really look for that.So when it comes to photos overall, we're thoroughly impressed by the iPhone SE. Yes, a much more expensive phone produces images that are better when forensically analysed, but for capturing a moment and sharing, this as good a camera as you could want on a budget phone.The only disappointment is the lack of Night Mode. This is present on the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11, and gets sharp, usable shots in lighting that the iPhone SE would be useless in.The Google Pixel 3a, which is one of Apple's biggest rivals at this price, has its own equivalent (called Night Sight). While this feature alone isn't enough to sway us towards the Pixel 3a, we do think it's a significant check in its column.One of the most important things Apple has done with the iPhone SE is to put its latest and greatest phone processor in it. That's not because we're tech fans who insist on have the fastest stuff (though it's not not because of that…), but rather it's because it means Apple has built this phone to last.Having Apple's A13 processor – the same chip that powers the iPhone 11 Pro – means that no matter what fancy new features are added to iOS in the coming  years, this phone will be able to run it. And not just run it, but run it as fast and smoothly as Apple's flagship handset of the same vintage.It's about future-proofing – this phone is set up to be a purchase that you can rely on for the several years without worrying about it slowing down horribly.Geekbench 4

It faster than, well, everything except the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro, which it's equal to.What does this mean for you in the real world? In general use, it just means that the phone moves as quickly as you do. Tap to open an app and it loads instantly. Choose a big picture in Photos and you can zoom with no slow-down, and apply edits instantly. Webpages load as quickly as your internet allows. It just means that the phone is never a bottleneck for what you want to do.It's great to know you can be as ambitious as you want with what you do on this phone, from 4K video editing to 3D models appearing in augmented reality, and it'll all just work.The Touch ID fingerprint sensor works immediately too, and with the phone waking itself as soon as you pick it up, unlocking it is just a matter of putting a little pressure on that Home button, which is great.We mentioned that the Home button feels a little odd – that because it's not a real button. When you apply pressure, a little motor under it creates the 'feel' of a clicking button. That's fine for giving feedback, but you can tell that nothing is actually moving when you 'press' the button. It's not a problem, but it takes a little getting used to.Almost everything in iOS – Apple's software for its iPhones – works exactly the same here as it does on the more expensive iPhones, with one notable exception. On all current iPhones except the iPhone SE, when you have a notification on the Home screen, you can press and hold on that notification for a second to bring up an expanded version of the notification with more options.This is really handy – I have a smart security camera, and I can just press a notification to see the snapshot of a motion warning, so I can decide to ignore a false alarm without unlocking my phone and going into an app.When someone texts you, you can reply right from the lock screen. When an app sends overzealous notifications, you can mute them without going into any settings. There's a load of stuff this feature is useful for. It's also used for buttons to quickly open the camera or turn on the torch.But this feature is missing from the iPhone SE. It's not a deal-breaker, but as a long-time iPhone user, it really stood out to me. Richer notifications have been a staple of using iPhones for a few years now, and it's very strange not to have the quick option on a phone that is, in every other way, a peer of its siblings. There actually is a way to access more rich options on the lock screen, but it's by swiping right to left on a notification and then tapping View and then tapping the other option you want. This is not only hidden, it's slow, and people won't use it.People coming from the old iPhone SE won't know it's missing, but I still don't think the convenience of it is something people getting a new iPhone should have to miss out on.Given the smaller screen of the iPhone SE compared to other phones, you might expect a strong showing here – screens are the biggest battery drain for a phone, after all.But the iPhone SE is pretty average for battery life, all told. It's not bad, but it didn't impress us, either – that came through in real use as well as more intense testing.Taking it out for about an hour of photography testing reduced the battery life by 12% – that's fairly hardcore usage that involves the screen being on a lot, and lots of processing. And it was also receiving emails and so on during that time.Based on other testing, it seems to be intense processing that most taxes the battery: running Geekbench 4's battery benchmark (which fires lots of tasks at the phone continuously in a way that's not representative of normal use, but gives us a repeatable examination) took the phone's battery down by 25% in one hour. In comparison, the same test on an iPhone 11 Pro (the closest iPhone in physical size) took the battery down by 15%.However, when we switch to something less processor intensive and more screen-focused, such as streaming a movie through Netflix, the tables turn. The lower power needed for the iPhone SE's smaller display meant it dropped just 9% after a full hour of Netflix at half brightness, whereas the iPhone 11 Pro dropped 11% playing the same movie (again at half brightness).These tests backed up what we saw using it in real life – this will get you through a day of use happily, but don't expect more. The bigger iPhones come with bigger batteries and longer life as a result.The iPhone SE is the budget phone we'd recommend to most people: iOS is easy to use and reliable, the phone's powerful processor will keep it relevant for years, the camera is as good as flagship phones that cost twice as much (or more), and the high-quality build is really pleasing just to hold.It's so close to being a five-star phone – and for some people, it might as well be. Our chief complaints are that the battery life is merely average, that it strangely lacks the useful lock-screen notifications shortcuts feature that other iPhones have, and that there's no Night Mode in the camera (which its primary competitor, the Google Pixel 3a, offers).We know that lots of people looking at the SE will be light users for whom all of the above just aren't concerns really – everything about it is good enough or better. For those people, it's a superb buy.It's also worth factoring in Apple's support network – if you do have problems or an accident with the phone, Apple's stores and repair service are second-to-none for fixing things up.August 2020 – Read our iOS 14 hands-on review to discover the features coming to your iPhone SE in Apple's next update.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/iphone-se-2020-review

I've been putting Honor's latest phone through its paces for two weeks and what follows here is my in-depth experiential take on the new flagship. Is the Honor View 20 still worth considering in 2020? Let's find out.For those who need an immediate take away, here is the Honor View 20 review in a nutshell: unsurprisingly, considering Honor's incredible output last year, which saw the Honor View 10, Honor 10 and then Honor Play bag big fat 5 stars each from T3 on review, the Honor View 20 is a very good mobile phone. Fans of the brand will be relieved to hear that Honor has not suddenly dropped the ball at the start of the year of the pig.The Honor View 20 is, core specs-wise, comparable to parent company Huawei's best phones, as well as those of its rivals. But where Honor differs is in its intended audience and community, with its range of handsets - and it truly is a range now with this flagship sitting at the top - clearly aimed at younger generations.Be it through its visually arresting and bold Aurora nanotexture backplate, big focus on gaming and consuming media, and AR lens-toting, AI packing camera system, which seemed geared toward recording and interacting with the user's real-world experiences in a very immediate way, the Honor View 20 communicates this pitch to youth greater that any of its phones to date and, putting it simply, this device feels like it is a flagship for a generation.It lacks some of the refinements and high-end features of the very best smartphones money can buy, such as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. However, the View 20 in general (but not always) successfully sheds these as superfluous for its intended user by doubling its focus on what the generation wants and doing so while maintaining a flagship core spec at a far from flagship price point.As such, whether or not the Honor View 20 is the right flagship phone for you will largely depend on who you are and what you prize from a phone. Naturally, it will also depend on how much you are prepared to spend on a phone, too, which is where this full Honor View 20 review now begins.In the Honor View 20 box you get the phone, a transparent bumper case, power plug and power USB Type-C cable.The Honor View 20 is available to order right now from a variety of retailers including Honor's official online shop.The Honor View 20 comes in two hardware variants, a 6GB/128GB model, and a 8GB/256GB model.Lastly, in terms of colourways, the Honor View 20 is available in Sapphire Blue, Midnight Black, Phantom Red and Phantom Blue (the model tested). Importantly, which spec model you get determines which colourways you can choose from, though, with the 6GB/128GB model coming in Sapphire Blue and Midnight Black, and the 8GB/256GB version coming in Phantom Blue and Phantom Red.In the Honor View 20 box you get the phone, a see-through case, as well as a power plug and USB Type-C cable. Paperwork and a SIM card extractor tool completes the package.Take the Honor View 20 out of its box and the first thing that hits you is its bold Aurora nanotexture design, which not only is very vibrant in terms of base colour but also generates a series of V-shaped gradient that catch the light at pretty much any angle. The result is a phone that, when placed face down, really stands out against its contemporaries.While technically impressive, though, personally I didn't care too much for the shiny and hyper-bold design, and after showing the Honor View 20 to friends and colleagues opinion was definitely split on whether it was fabulous or simply too much. If I had a choice, I'd plump for the subtler hyper optical pattern tech witnessed on the backplate of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, but I fully realise that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.The Honor View 20's Aurora nanotexture backplate generates V-shaped light chevrons.Despite its large screen size the Honor View 20 feels surprisingly light in the hand (and at 180 grams it is compared to many of its contemporaries) and, for want of a better description, not dense. I've gone on record before saying that I personally prefer handsets that feel dense and solid in the hand, such as the HTC U12+ and Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Huawei Mate 20 Pro, and being totally honest the Honor View 20 doesn't tick that box, with its visually impressive backplate radiating a plasticky feel under the fingertips. This at least can't be said for the phone's cool to the touch metal frame.Again, I realise that many users prize lightness over everything and if you do and also like the Honor View 20's courageous (to quote the late Sir Humphrey Appleby) Aurora design, then the design and build quality on display here will definitely float your boat.Asides from that, though, it is business as usual: you've got a power button and volume rocker on the right hand side of the phone, bottom centre-mounted USB Type-C port, and top left hand side-mounted headphone jack (which considering the OnePlus 6T dropped it just a few months back feels like a smart move to me for a device designed to take its position).On the front of device you have the phone's new front-facing pinhole camera (more on that later) in the top left hand side of the screen, while on the back you have the device's main rear camera lens and secondary 3D camera and flash array top-left, as well as a top centre-mounted fingerprint reader (yes, there is no in-screen fingerprint reader on the Honor View 20, which considering the OnePlus 6T does have one and retails for the same price feels like a notable absence).Overall, then, if I was to compare the feel of the Honor View 20 in the hand I would say it feels most like a slightly thicker but lighter version of the OnePlus 6T.The Honor View 20 comes installed with a large 6.4-inch LCD screen, which is only interrupted by the system's pinhole front camera.As well as the marked Aurora design the other thing that immediately strikes you when using the Honor View 20 is how large the screen is - this is not a small phone. A 6.4-inch LCD screen with a 1080 x 2310 resolution only tells half the story, too, as the combination of a 91.8% body-to-screen ratio and embedded 4.5mm punchhole camera cut-out mean that while this screen is very large, it doesn't feel oversized and is still very usable with one hand.As the panel is an LCD unsurprisingly it looks very sharp to the naked eye, however it's FHD+ resolution doesn't actually match that of top-tier flagship phones, with devices like the best Android phone on market right now, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, boasting a WQHD+ resolution of 3,120 x 1,440 for example.The LCD screen's colour mode and temperature can be customised in the phone's options menu, along with many other things such as screen resolution.Naturally, with the screen being an LCD I was naturally a little wary about colour depth and vibrancy, however I am pleased to confirm that thanks to the phone's Colour mode & temperature options you can tinker to the vividness and warmth of the display to your heart's content.Is the vibrancy and colour depth as good as that on, say, the Bravia-engineered Sony Xperia XZ4 display, or the SuperAMOLED installed on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9? No, no it is not. However, it is bright and crisp screen that doesn't leave one wanting, and particularly not at this financial level, which is hundreds of pounds beneath the phones listed above.[CPU]Single-core score: 3,297Multi-core score: 9,727[Compute]RenderScript score: 6,729[Battery]Battery score: 6614Confidence: MediumMoving inside the phone we find a hardware suite that leaves absolutely nothing to be desired. Sitting at the heart of the Honor View 20 is one of the world's fastest mobile processors right now, the outrageously rapid Kirin 980. This is the exact same processor installed in our favourite Android phone right now, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and, when we compare our standard CPU test benchmark scores between the two handsets, we find they are basically identical.While the Huawei Mate 20 Pro posted a single-core GeekBench 4 CPU score of 3,290, the Honor View 20 posted a score of 3,297, and where the Mate 20 Pro lodged a multi-core score of 9,714, the View 20 managed 9,727.Ultimate Car Driving Simulator ran like a dream on the Honor View 20, maintaining a very high frame rate at all times.And, what's more, when we move on to GeekBench 4's Compute test, we find that the Honor View 20 could post a RenderScript score of 6,729, which is far in advance of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro's recorded score of 6,242. This improvement could of come through optimisations made by Honor or, more likely, due to the additional 2GB of RAM installed in our View 20 review unit.These excellent benchmark scores, unsurprisingly, translate into very, very fast real-world phone performance. Rattling though the phone's Android 9.0-based Magic UI was buttery smooth, in-app performance incredibly responsive, and game and media loading and consumption rapid and compromise-free. Yes, I can confirm that the combination of Kirin 980 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space translates to a bullet proof core mobile experience on the View 20.Watching content on YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video was an enjoyable, immersive experience on the Honor View 20 thanks to its large and crisp 6.4-inch screen.But, as I've mentioned before, I now fully expect mid-price range flagships such the Honor View 20 (and it's main rival the OnePlus 6T) to be able to handle everything Android can currently throw at them as, well, the fact of the matter is that the demands of Android and its app store was long ago bypassed by top tier smartphones.Graphically intensive games like Dragon Ball Legends ran incredibly well on the Honor View 20, while media consumption was eased by rapid app loading and operation.One notable area of performance that I feel was particularly noteworthy is how well graphically intensive mobile games ran on the View 20, with titles like Dragon Ball Legends, Tekken, Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition and Ultimate Car Driving Simulator really motoring along in terms of frame rate. The phone, for example, felt as good to play these games on as last year's dedicated Honor gaming phone, the Honor Play, and clearly that is down to the Chinese maker's GPU Turbo 2.0 tech, which really does seem to add some serious under-the-hood power.The Honor View 20's big camera sell is its rear lens' ability to shoot 48MP images.The headline camera feature on the Honor View 20 is its front-mounted pinhole camera, which hides a 25MP, F/2.0, hardware-based HDR, portrait lighting-toting lens. Visually, this means that the phone's large 6.4-inch screen remains completely uninterrupted aside from a small keyring-size hole in the top left hand corner.As someone who never really bought into the whole notch thing as a feature, but equally one that hasn't really being appalled by their introduction to many phones, flagship or otherwise, I feel this is a small but welcome step forward towards the ideal of having all front-facing sensors and camera hidden in-screen.On the rear the Honor View 20 comes installed with a 48MP main camera (F/1.8, 1/2-inch CMOS sensor) supported with a secondary 3D camera for depth sensing, effects and 3D motion control gaming.The big sell with this single camera lens is its ability to shoot 48MP size images, which can then be taken to an even more detailed level with Honor's AI Ultra Clarity shooting option. This shooting mode has been designed for when shooting landscapes in good lighting conditions, and entails the system to shoot a series of images before stitching them together through software to produce images with excellent levels of zoomable detail.Check out the example images below to see how the 48MP Ultra Clarity setting works.A shot taken with the Honor View 20's 48MP AI Ultra Clarity setting enabled. See the image below to see the distanced level of detail captured.And the same image but zoomed in close to see the church tower's clock. Notice how despite the distance involved the clock face is still easily readable.Another of the notable shooting modes on the Honor View 20 is its ""Night"" mode, which through the 48MP lens along with the company's 4-in-1 superpixel tech and Artificial Image Stabilization (AIS) allows even the darkest of scenes to be captured. The image below, showing my rear garden in the darkness of the early morning, shows the ""Night"" mode's power.Shot with a standard Photo mode this scene was pitch black and, where small amounts of detail was discernible, very blurry. With Night mode on, though, suddenly many aspects of the image are visible, and the depth of the garden is communicated well, too. The lightest parts of the scene, such as the glimmers of dawn on the horizon as well as a planet and couple of stars, are also amplified.An image taken in the darkness of the early morning with the Honor View 20's camera's ""Night"" shooting mode. Despite the garden appearing pitch black to the naked eye, details can be made out in the image.Naturally, for a phone that is geared towards youth, the Honor View 20 has an advanced portrait mode shooting option, which works both through the front and rear cameras. Asides from leaning a little too much towards artificial smoothing for my liking, the mode allows both beautification and shaping, as well as various types of lighting and patterns to be included, too.While not best in class, I was also impressed with the portrait's mode handling of bokeh.Honor's portrait mode in action in selfie orientation. Honor's algorithm still leans a little bit too much towards smoothing in my mind.And the View 20's portrait mode's results using the rear camera.In terms of more standard photography the Honor View 20 allows for a variety of aspect ratios and resolutions to be shot at, with the default 12MP 4:3 images capable of being switched to 7MP 19.2.9 shots, which are good for wide if not tall landscapes, and 9MP 1:1 images. Providing you stay at a 4:3 ratio (perfect for Instagram, right) you can scale up to the system's flagship 48MP resolution, too.What I would say is, though, that while those 48MP images are impressive, and the amount of shooting modes on offer equally so, the camera system on the Honor View 20 is not in the ballpark of a trilogy of rivals, mainly due to its single primary rear lens, which cannot match the widescreen or zoom functionality of devices like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and HTC U12+. And that is saying nothing of the Google Pixel 3 XL, either…As you can see from the image gallery above, though, colour capture and detail is good and, unlike some devices, excessive noise at the periphery doesn't seem to an issue, either.Yes, I am that cool. Live with it…Lastly, on the Honor View 20's camera system, I feel I need to mention that, yes, it comes packing an AR lens functionality with, most importantly for some no doubt, 3D Qmoji. This means that you can pose and record yourself as a variety of cartoon 3D avatars ranging from a lizard and penguin, through to robots and cats.The Honor View 20's camera system is packed with shooting modes and settings, including an AR lens with 3D Qmoji.And, as can be seen above in the image of me looking too cool for school with my natty pair of supersized shades, the AR lens camera also lets you take pictures of yourself or others with a variety of augmented backgrounds or extra details.  Again, while I find this functionality a gimmick at best, I do realise that many put much stock in it and use these sorts of shooting features on a weekly basis. If you are one of them then the Honor View 20 will not disappoint.The Honor View 20 comes installed with a 4,000mAh battery.The Honor View 20 comes with a capacious 4,000 mAh battery, which while falling short of the titanic 4,200 mAh unit powering the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, is a definite improvement over the Honor View 10's 3,750 mAh.The main real-world difference this number increase delivers is the ability for the phone to be used for two days on a single charge. Numerous times during my testing period did I take the Honor View 20 out with me at 100 per cent charge one morning, only to then not charge it for the entirety of that day and then through the next, only plugging it back in to charge on the second day's evening.I found the battery on the Honor View 20 to be perfectly cable of two days operation with medium usage on a single charge.Sure, this only works with light to medium usage, so you can forget playing Football Manager Mobile for three hours before watching the extended version of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and then expecting the same level of multi-day battery performance. But providing you use everything in moderation, then one and a half to two days will definitely be possible.The Honor View 20 does not have an in-screen fingerprint reader, with its circular reader located on the backplate instead.The Honor View 20 comes loaded with Android 9.0 Pie, which as I've noted before, is the slickest and fastest Android operating system ever, as well as Honor's own latest light skinning of it, Magic UI 2.0.1. Fans of vanilla Android will not find it hard to get on with Honor View 20 in my mind, as Magic comes with minimal bloatware (just core proprietary apps like HiCare, AppGallery and Honor store) and is very intuitive to use.Your security options on the Honor View 20 include Fingerprint ID via the phone's rear-mounted fingerprint reader, which I found to be fast and generally first-time reliable, as well as via Face recognition, which isn't the biometric wizardry as evidenced on the Apple iPhone XS, but it is easy to setup and reliably fast to use. You can also tweak it functionality to your desire, with direct unlock, slide unlock and  notification reveals able of being enabled or disabled following face recognition.For the money, you can't get a faster and more powerful phone than the Honor View 20 right now. And, for my money, that makes it a winner.Overall, then, the raw power offered by the Honor View 20, which as I've shown is in advance of many flagships from major players that cost hundreds of pounds more, successfully burns off any small issues I had with the device.Personally, the very bold nanotexture backplate and light feel of the device did not float my boat in the end, while the absence of an in-display fingerprint reader when the View 20's direct rival, the OnePlus 6T does have one, felt disappointing as a tech enthusiast. The lack of a few other high-profile features that I personally enjoy, like wireless charging, also couldn't help but deflate somewhat.Be under no illusion, despite it being a great mobile phone, the Honor View 20 won't be for everyone, and you should ask yourself exactly what you want from a handset today and how much you are willing to spend before you make a decision.And, being totally honest, that's the beauty of the Android ecosystem. If you want an in-display fingerprint reader on your £500 Android phone then you can plump for the OnePlus 6T or Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro. Or if you want your £500 Android phone to carry an extremely fast mobile processor, have an incredibly standout design, and deliver the ability to shoot 48MP images, then you can opt for the Honor View 20. It really is that simple.However, for its intended market, which I honestly don't think care too much about these sorts of esoteric features, this is a bold and brash powerhouse flagship that's sure to appeal to young professionals the world over.The Honor View 20 is the best phone Honor has ever made, and it is one that cements its position as one of the most radical phone makers in business today.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/honor-view-20
79,Sony Xperia XZ2,Sony Xperia XZ2 review: is this the sleep hit of the year?,"Dimensions: 153 x 72 x 11.1 mmWeight: 198gProcessor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 845RAM: 4GBStorage: 64GBDisplay: 5.7"", 18:9 Full HD+ (1080 x 2160) HDRRear camera:  19MP (F2.0)Front camera: 5MP (F2.2)Battery: 3,180 mAhOS: Android 8.0 OreoSo the Sony Xperia XZ2 is here, fully unveiled at Mobile World Congress, and after spending a good portion of the time since testing the phone, it is evident that it is a competitive match for other Android phones – and even now a few years after its release in 2020.The XZ2 delivers a top all-round hardware package, with a powerful Snapdragon 845 processor partnered with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and a vibrant 5.7-inch, 18:9, HDR Full HD+ display. The phone is also loaded with a technically impressive camera system, too, and one that on top of good picture taking credentials also delivers a super-impressive world-first for a smartphone: the ability to record 4K, HDR video.There's some interesting, unique features packed into the latest flagship Xperia as well, such as its Dynamic Vibration system.However, all of these qualities are of significantly less importance than the phone's design, and specifically whether Sony could finally ditch the massive bezels that have haunted its devices over recent years (especially in light of the bezel-less Samsung Galaxy S9 and Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus beauties).To find out whether or not Sony has finally caught up with the market in terms of looks and feel, which is so important to people when choosing a smartphone, read on. Before getting to the all-important details of the review, though, check out the Sony Xperia XZ2's hype-tastic launch trailer:The four XZ2 colours to choose from: black, silver, blue, and pinkThe XZ2 has a markedly curved back with a shiny gloss finish.It's OK, you can breathe a sigh of relief, Sony has finally delivered the bold design overhaul its Xperia range so badly needed, with its new ""Ambient Flow"" design language delivering a device that is curvier and more fluid than ever before. In terms of pure looks, the XZ2's shiny mirror-gloss finish is just lovely.Yes, gone is the blocky, chunky aesthetic and in is the Sony Xperia XZ2, a phone with few sharp edges and a look that is not too dissimilar from the attractive HTC U11+. The phone feels smooth and comfortable in the hand, even though its front and back Gorilla Glass 5 build is a monstrous fingerprint magnet, and it slips into and out of a pocket very easily.Sony has finally delivered the bold design overhaul its Xperia range so badly neededPhone critics have spent years complaining about the massive bezels on Sony phones and, thankfully, while still in residence with the Xperia XZ2, they are far reduced from last year's offerings. Their presence does leave the XZ2 looking not quite so futuristic as Samsung, Huawei, or HTC's latest offerings, but overall the phone definitely has a more attractive new look.Interestingly, the Xperia XZ2 is not equipped with the 4K display we saw on the Xperia XZ Premium, with Sony plumping instead for just a Full HD+ (1080 x 2160) display. Last year T3 said that the Premium's 4K screen was overkill and after using the crisp screen on the XZ2 over a variety of applications, it is easy to agree, as at no point did it lead to a desire for a bigger resolution. Plus, the Xperia XZ2's screen is HDR, and benefits from Sony's X-Reality Dynamic Contrast Enhancer, too, meaning images and video look very vibrant.The XZ1's Snapdragon 835 processor has been upgraded to a 845 in the XZ2.Sony normally knocks it out of the park with internal hardware spec, and with the Xperia XZ2 the story is the same, with the phone rocking a great all round hardware package that includes the rapid Snapdragon 845 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage space, and a 3,180mAh battery that supports wireless fast charging capabilities.Compare this spec to the other Android flagships and it compares favourablyCompare this spec to the other Android flagships and it compares favourably – for example, it shares the same RAM, processor (in the US) and storage spec as Samsung's new Galaxy S9, while also out-doing it slightly in terms of battery life. Simply put, there is absolutely no issue with the XZ2's power as a flagship device, as it either matches or exceeds its rivals.Gaming on the XZ2, such as playing versus fighter Tekken, is a smooth, immersive experience.Notable new hardware features include a powerful new Dynamic Vibration system, which is no doubt influenced by Apple's haptic engine. This system allows detailed vibration feedback in music, games and movies, with the phone vibrating in varying degrees of strength (for example, if you get hit by a light attack in Tekken then you get a light vibration feedback, while if you get hit with a heavy attack then you get a stronger vibration).Dynamic Vibration can be activated or deactivated in the settings menu, but it is also prompted for use upon starting certain games and apps, with a pop-up notifying you of the functionality. More information is also supplied if necessary via Xperia Chat.Dynamic Feedback is available in games, videos and music. It can be enabled and disabled easily.The XZ2 has a fingerprint sensor, too, although it is located right next to the camera system and it isn't quite as comfortable to use as the offerings tested from HTC and Samsung. We're not sure you'll end up frequently smudging the XZ2's camera lens as well, as the two are positioned a decent distance from each other (this was a common complaint on the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, which located the two far too close together).And, talking of the Sony Xperia XZ2's camera system...An exploded breakdown of the XZ2's 19MP Motion Eye camera.As you would expect from Sony, the Xperia XZ2 has a very strong camera hardware offering, even though the unit is the same one delivered last year in the Xperia XZ1. The XZ2's camera system isn't identical, though, as there's a 19MP single-sensor camera on the rear that can shoot in 4K HDR. This is definitely a major step forward for smartphones, as it was only recently that such capabilities were the preserve of expensive dedicated camera equipment, so the fact that you can now carry that capability around in your pocket is fantastic.Sony has trumped Samsung by allowing 960fps recording at not just 720p, but a Full HD 1080pAlso, almost as a reminder to the industry about who actually brought 960fps slow-motion recording capabilities to market first (hint: it was Sony last year), Sony has trumped the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus' offerings by allowing 960fps recording at not just 720p, but a Full HD 1080p. This is a fantastic achievement, even if you are limited to only three seconds of super slow-mo recording time per video. Naturally, you can also shoot 120fps standard slow-motion videos as well.Sony has also but some extra effort into improving the XZ2's low-light performance, with a memory packed Exmor RS image sensor and wide ISO range to play with. There's also faster image processing on the Xperia XZ2 thanks to an upgraded BIONZ image processor.As you can see from the above images, which were captured on T3's XZ2 review unit, detail is definitely a strength for the XZ2, with shots packing plenty of depth. Colour reproduction is good, too, with clean vibrant distinction, and we're still huge fans of the Xperia's dedicated right-hand-side mounted camera button, which allows immediate booting into the camera app with a single long press.The XZ2's camera is much higher than its fingerprint sensor, meaning you don't end up smudging its lens.The actual camera app on the XZ2 is very similar to that which featured on the XZ1, and offers plenty of creative and specialist shooting modes, such as Bokeh, Panorama, AR effect (allows you to place AR objects or tiny creatures on things) and Manual. Navigation in the camera app isn't the fastest we've tested but is perfectly usable, and we didn't suffer any app glitches or crashes during the testing period.The only aspect of the XZ2's camera system that we feel is definitely second best in comparison to the Samsung Galaxy S9, which is now considered the new benchmark for flagship Android smartphones, is in its image grain and, in some images, noise when zooming in up close.The detail delivered by the scanning is impressive, however, getting a good scan takes a while and is finickity.Sony's version of Apple's Animoji and Samsung's AR Emoji comes via its 3D Creator tool, which allows you to scan faces, heads, food and freeform objects, before then having a 3D model spat out for use, sharing or even printing.Unlike Animoji, whereby the pre-set creatures simply mimic your expression and lip movement, or AR Emoji, which allows you to create your virtual avatar simply by holding the camera up to your face for a moment, the facial and head scans from 3D Creator require calibration, scanning and sculpting before they are usable.A slide from the 3D Creator's face-scanning tutorial.This not only requires a multi-slide tutorial with learning videos, but also a definite trial and error process to get a good representation, with T3 suffering a series of less-than-flattering misfires before getting something that looked passable. Also, unlike Apple and Samsung's rival systems, you can't live pose the created avatar - so I am afraid if you want to send kissy-face avatar to your significant other then you'll need to do a new scan.We've got to be honest, despite the detail of scanning being impressive and beyond its rivals, we got frustrated with the 3D Creator tool out of the box. It definitely feels like it could do with another development and polishing pass to make it easier to use and more integrated, as we feel only the most patient, avatar-loving users will find it genuinely useful at the moment.Corning Gorilla Glass 5 lines the front and back of the XZ2.The Sony Xperia XZ2 comes equipped with some seriously good audio credentials, too. Hi-Resolution Audio is delivered, along with DSEE HX technology that upscales files, and there's also a pair of stereo speakers that have been specifically tuned to reduce distortion at higher volumes.I enjoyed listening to a wide variety of albums on the XZ2, ranging from Soft Sounds From Another Planet by Japanese Breakfast, Automaton by Jamiroquai, Risotto by Fluke, the Wolf Hall soundtrack by Debbie Wiseman, and Solace by Jean Baudin and I was very impressed with the audio quality delivered.Were the XZ2's upgraded stereo speakers good enough for me to play my music through them while writing, cooking and cleaning? Not by a long shot, and I'm sure that anyone with a modicum of Hi-Fi in their blood would think the same. There is no doubting though that they sound louder and cleaner than those on the XZ1, though, and youngsters who wish to annoy people on public transport will no doubt have a ball.Pleasingly, the Sony Xperia XZ2 comes with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, and while the UI isn't stock, it is very lightly skinned, meaning it feels familiar and comfortable to use.Sony's Battery Care feature reduces the amount of time the phone's battery is charged over 90 per cent in order to extend the cell's lifespan.The Xperia XZ2 comes equipped with a 3,180mAh battery. From T3's testing period this battery held up very well in day-to-day usage scenarios, with medium usage leading to the phone losing just over 50 per cent of its battery power over 24 hours.Charging was also rapid, especially from a low-level starting point, and took about 40 minutes to attain two-thirds battery life. The now widespread Qi wireless charging is also enabled on the Xperia XZ2 and from our testing period the Sony flagship consistently made a connection at a variety of placement angles.The XZ2 sports an IP65/68 water resistance rating.I'm not sure whether the Xperia XZ2 is going to be underrated this year and struggle to sell, or if it will be a run-away sleeper hit for Sony. The phone delivers on every hardware front and even comes packing some world-first exclusive features to help separate it from the crowd. Its screen, too, despite taking a step down in resolution from the XZ Premium's 4K offering, is incredibly vibrant and pleasurable to look at.Sony has also made a big push to redesign the look of the Xperia phone, with a new curved, sleeker design that feels far more at home among its competitors offerings. Yes, Sony hasn't been able to fully let go of those bezels yet, but they are much smaller and the overall look and feel of the phone is very nice indeed.The phone, priced SIM-free in the UK at  £699, is also less than Samsung's S9 and competitive considering the great specs, which either match or exceed rival flagships, so that is also a boon for Sony.However, despite all this great work, it's easy to remain unsure how much star power the Sony Xperia XZ2 has. Will the strong hardware package and camera system, as well as solid redesign be enough to win people over, as it did here at T3.com? Only time will tell.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/sony-xperia-xz2-review
80,OnePlus 6T,OnePlus 6T review: a fast and stylish Android phone,"Dimensions: 157.5 x 74.8 x 8.2 mmWeight: 185 gramsScreen: 6.41-inch, 19.5:9, Optic AMOLED, 2,340 x 1,080CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 (octa-core, 1nm, 2.8GHz)GPU: Adreno 630RAM: 8GBStorage: 128GBRear cameras: 16MP (OIS, EIS, f/1.7) / 20MP (f/1.7)Front camera: 16MP (EIS, f/2.0)Battery: 3,700 mAhOS: Android 9.0 PieUI: OxygenOSIs the OnePlus 6T still an option smartphone users should consider in 2020? Absolutely. It is a fast and feature-packed phone that Android users will love. It is also now significantly cheaper than it was at launch, making it a great budget buy.I rather liked the OnePlus 6 on review, with me praising its ""absolutely atomic"" speed, and ""benchmark scores that absolutely smoke rival flagships"".Fast forward almost six months and OnePlus has returned with its usual mid-year update of the device in the form of the OnePlus 6T.In 2017 the OnePlus 5T proved to be far from a cash-in, delivering a notably enhanced package than the OnePlus 5 offered, and quickly became known as the mid-range smartphone to beat. Indeed, to this day it sits proudly in T3's best cheap phones guide.As such, going into this OnePlus 6T review I had high hopes for a quality device, although I was also very aware that the smartphone market is, despite it being only a year later, a noticeably different environment.Could the OnePlus 6T continue the take down Android flagships with a combination of insane speed and unbeatable value for money?As we will see, the answer to this question is significantly more yes than no, however it isn't clear cut, so I would advise you to read on through the full OnePlus 6T review to get my full, nuanced opinion.Before we get to the OnePlus 6T review proper, though, you should take a moment to watch the official launch trailer for the handset, as it quickly summates its highlight hardware and features.The OnePlus  6T comes with a fantastic in-the-box package.In the OnePlus 6T box you get a USB Type-C to 3.5mm Audio adaptor (as the 3.5mm audio jack has been removed), a pre-applied screen protector, see-through phone case, a fast charge USB Type-C cable and power adaptor, and a SIM tray ejector. You do not get a pair of those cheap wired headphones in the box (because, you know, they're awful and nobody who actually enjoys music uses them).I was impressed with the package you get in the OnePlus 6T boxOverall I was impressed with the all-round package you get in the OnePlus 6T box. In a world where certain companies (cough, Apple, cough) ask an extra £9 for a headphone jack adapter, or over £20 for a basically mandatory case, what OnePlus does it very refreshing.OnePlus' determination to be the Apple of the Android smartphone world is none more evident than in its approach to the design of its devices, which simple ooze style and class.This starts with the packaging of the device itself and continues unabated in the OnePlus 6T into its 3D Glass covering (Gorilla Glass 6, no less), smart-arc backing and horizon line, as well as cool-to-the-touch, smoothly curved frame.I can confirm that the OnePlus 6T remains just as good looking as the OnePlus 6, and ergonomically it is one of the stronger devices I've tested this year (although, of course, this is lost if a case is used).In terms of dimensions and weight, the OnePlus 6T measures in at 157.5x74.8x8.2mm and weighs 185 grams, making it heavier and fractionally thicker than the OnePlus 6, which measures in at  155.7 x 75.4 x 7.75 mm and weighs 177 grams.As you would expect with such small differences, I could not feel the difference in the hand.With the case off, the OnePlus 6T looks sleek, and especially so in the Midnight Black colourwayNotable design changes from the OnePlus 6 include a much smaller, tear-drop notch (I love it) and, dun dun dun, no headphone jack. Is that the issue that many have turned  it into? No. Obviously not. How is this still a thing?You simply can't have one aspect of a phone dictating everything else and actively holding back other aspects, such as battery capacity.As OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei said, ""you've got to make decisions that optimize the user experience"". Oh, and this was before Pei also dropped the narrative destroying bomb that 59 per cent of all OnePlus users already own wireless headphones and, for those who don't, the company was including a USB Type-C to headphone adaptor FOR FREE in the OnePlus 6T box.The result, in my mind at least, is a more powerful overall phone and a freeing of OnePlus to really innovate in terms design for 2019's OnePlus 7 flagship.Hardware-wise the entry-level OnePlus 6T comes packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage space, and a 3,700mAh battery.A more powerful version of the phone is also available, which comes with 8GB of RAM, which is the model I tested here.This hardware is, simply put, very good, and it leads to a very rapid, slick experience both in the Android 9.0 Pie-backed OxygenOS, as well as in app installing, loading and running.My usual test suite of demanding mobile games, which include DBZ Legends, Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, Final Fantasy 15 Pocket Edition, and Tekken, all ran seamlessly on the OnePlus 6T. But to be honest, this is no great surprise as the identically specced OnePlus 6 I reviewed nearly six-months also handled these games perfectly.[CPU test]Single-core: 2,414Multi-core: 8,997[Compute test]RenderScript: 13,580[Battery score]Battery Score Estimate: 3,563As you can see from the nearby boxout, the OnePlus 6T also returned very strong GeekBench 4 benchmark scores. These scores are right up there with the best flagships going, and the OnePlus 6T beats many of the big-name phones here, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and Google Pixel 3 XL.However, it should be noted that the OnePlus 6T was still beaten here in both single-core and multi-core performance by the Kirin 980-powered Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which posted single-core and multi-core scores of 3,290 and 9,714 to the 6T's 2,414 and 8,997.The OnePlus 6T returned very strong benchmark scoresThe new, engorged 6.41-inch, 19.5:9, Optic AMOLED, 2,340 x 1,080 screen is as capacious as it sounds, and with the smaller notch, it really is a device that appears all-screen. And 86 per cent screen-to-body ratio backs this up; while the new Screen Calibration settings allows you to tinker with its output as you wish.Unsurprisingly, this ""Optic AMOLED"" display looks to the eye very similar to the vivid HDR panel installed on the OnePlus 6, and I am confident that the majority of users will have no complaints about its ability to display content.Have I seen overall better panels in my opinion, though? Yes, absolutely, with for my money the Sony Xperia XZ3, Samsung Galaxy Note 9, and Huawei Mate 20 Pro beating it. Naturally, though, those phones cost more.One of the biggest issues I had with the OnePlus 6 was its camera performance, with unit beaten on and off paper by rival devices (at the time these were the Sony Xperia XZ2 and Samsung Galaxy S9) in terms of low-light performance and definition in flat-light environments.Since then, a trilogy of new flagship devices loaded with superb new camera systems have hit the market, too (we're looking at you Google Pixel 3 XL, Samsung Galaxy Note 9, and Huawei Mate 20 Pro), so I approached the OnePlus 6T with high hopes that OnePlus had moved its camera offering on significantly to compete.The results, unfortunately, fall short of what I wanted to see.Pro shooting mode delivers enhanced levels of control over each shot.In terms of hardware the OnePlus 6 came equipped with a dual 16MP f/1.7 and 20MP f/1.7 rear camera setup, and a 16MP f/2.0 front selfie camera.And, the OnePlus 6T comes with a dual 16MP f/1.7 and 20MP f/1.7 rear camera setup, and a 16MP f/2.0 front selfie camera. Yep, it's the exact same setup.So what's different? OnePlus says that it has loaded the 6T's camera system with a new algorithm that is not only professionally tuned, but automatically ""adjusts the front and rear camera to capture high-quality photos of commonly photographed images including faces, text, food, and night scenes.""Low-light and night time performance remains good but not best in class.Naturally, with the core hardware remaining unchanged, I attempted to put this claim to the test while shooting with the phone.As you can see from the above gallery and images below, results in my opinion, were once more mixed, with the 6T returning good but nowhere near best-in-class image quality across the board.Colour capture and vibrancy remains very good, and from my testing I do believe that the new algorithm does indeed help return better shots (the pirogi and salad meal, for example, was captured very well, and the below portrait was an improvement over the standard 6).Portrait mode seems improved slightly over the OnePlus 6, noticeably in terms of subtlety of bokeh, but it is beaten elsewhere by devices such as the LG G7 ThinQ, Apple iPhone XS, and Huawei Mate 20 Pro.However, I would definitely say that the small tweaks made to the 6T camera are very much optimising a system that was already beaten on the OnePlus 6, and now six months later feels dated when compared to what many rival flagship makers are offering.Yes, sure, if you're not used to using the best on offer today then the discrepancies between the available systems will be an unknown point for you and, yest, if you aren't in to photography then again you'll probably not be so bothered.And, yes, I also realise that the phones with better camera systems that beat the 6T do cost more. But, equally, I've tested phones that cost half what the OnePlus 6T retails for that deliver, in my opinion, a very similar photo-taking experience, so I feel that price point argument is pretty moot.1x and 2x levels of zoom shown off on the OnePlus 6T.Regardless of its technical limitations, though, the one thing I will say that remains a stronger point for the OnePlus 6T camera system is the broad array of shooting modes and menu options to tinker with.Google Lens is also built-in and can be enabled if you wish, and from my testing (see below images of The Book of Five Rings) worked consistently.The ability to shoot in 4K at 60fps, as well as Super Slow Motion at 1080p are also most welcome, and help deliver a system that while not the best you can buy in terms of output quality, is at least very versatile.Look, the OnePlus 6T is a perfectly capable camera system, but for a phone that firstly rules over the mid-range in terms of most other aspects with such an iron first, and secondly offered a near identical package six months ago, I feel it leaves things to be desired.I hope this is an area that OnePlus really goes to town on for 2019's OnePlus 7.As you can see from the above boxout, the OnePlus 6T returned average battery benchmark scores in GeekBench 4, which did not do much to convince me that OnePlus had addressed one of my issues when reviewing the OnePlus 6 - the ability for the phone to continue to deliver a day to a day and half's usage in a year from now.In the OnePlus 6 review I said that, ""I do wonder if the battery has the legs to continue powering these demanding experiences on such a well-endowed, large form-factor device, while also maintaining a north of a day usage period, in a year or so.""And, from my experience testing the 6T, and from looking at its benchmark scores, I do feel this slightly bigger capacity but bigger screen phone could have the same short-comings.3,700mAh is very standard now in terms of capacity for a flagship mobile, and when you compare it to the 4,000mAh unit in the Galaxy Note 9, and 4,200mAh unit in the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (which lasted me two full days repeatedly between charges), its real-world day to a day and half capabilities under medium use seem good but not great.Also, while we're on the battery, I was still slightly disappointed to see that the OnePlus 6T, as with the OnePlus 6, does not support wireless charging.I do realise that wireless charging is a Marmite feature for many, with some loving it and others hating it, preferring to always physically plug the device in to attain those rapid charges (which is something OnePlus has really nailed with Fast Charge tech).The OnePlus 6T's OxygenOS runs like a cheetah on steroidsHowever, as a tech enthusiast, when I look at the Huawei flagship, the Mate 20 Pro, that not only supports 40W SuperCharge tech that delivers a 70 per cent charge to its 4,200mAh battery in 30 minutes, but also supports wireless charging and wireless reverse charging, too, which is an amazingly cool piece of engineering, and then compare it to the OnePlus 6, I can't help coming away a little cold.In terms of software, I am pleased to confirm that the OnePlus 6T's OxygenOS runs like a cheetah on steroids. It also remains a very light skinning of vanilla Android 9.0 Pie, which is also decently customisable and packed with features, with Gaming Mode standing out as a no-brainer inclusion. As ever, and this is something certain makers could learn a lot from, the phone comes totally bloatware free. Bliss!And, lastly, that in-screen fingerprint reader. It works like a charm, being easy to setup and use, with my attempts to unlock the phone working first time basically every time. As with the face unlock function, too, it is lightning fast.The OnePlus 6T is a quality device, but boy does it play it safe.If my friend came up to me and said, ""I want to buy a new Android phone SIM-free outright and I've got £500 to spend, what should I buy?"", then I think it's fair to say that the OnePlus 6T would be the first phone that would spring to my mind.It's very fast, with great benchmark scores, has a sleek design, with Gorilla Glass 6 protecting its smooth curves, and delivers some bang on-trend features like an in-screen fingerprint reader (which works quickly and consistently).I'd definitely recommend the OnePlus 6T over the standard OnePlus 6, too, thanks to the new phone's increased storage space on the base model (128GB over 64GB) and its inclusion of Android 9.0 Pie out of the accessory-packed box.However, not everyone is going to be in that isolated example position, and even if they were, I'd also ask them just what level of capability they actually need from their device, as I would vouch that they may be better served spending less or, actually, spending more.Phones like the Honor Play and Xiaomi Mi 8, for example, don't deliver quite the experience that the OnePlus 6T does, but they get pretty damn close and do so for hundreds of pounds less and, in the case of the former, for less than half the price of the base-level OnePlus 6T.Naturally, the OnePlus 6T is perfect for consuming the quality content delivered on T3.com.And, equally, as good as the OnePlus 6T is, it is beaten in terms of camera system, battery capacity, processor speed, and high-level features by top, top tier Android phones like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, so if you're a user who absolutely needs that functionality then, again, you could be better served spending more now to get better longevity and value in the long term.Now of course, OnePlus will always have its die-hard enthusiasts, and with such a good hardware package and, crucially, attractive overriding ideology backing the maker's output, that makes perfect sense. There's a reason we've been praising OnePlus' phones for years now - they've been great and OnePlus has been the, to quote T3's OnePlus 5T review, ""plucky Chinese startup"" to beat.But OnePlus is no longer a startup and if it is looking to expand its user base, as hinted at by its partnership with Amazon and others this year, then I feel it could struggle to pitch its increasingly isolated mid-tier price point to those whose needs are actually best served by the blooming entry-level tier of smartphones. Or by the premium tier, who's users can get an excellent, top-table mobile experience from devices like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro and Apple iPhone XS Max.Overall, then, I come away from the OnePlus 6T with conflicted feelings. It's undoubtedly a classy phone, and one that offers a very fast and smooth core experience, but equally I'm not convinced it is a big enough jump to lure users from rival devices, nor to make OnePlus 6 owners upgrade just six months down the line at launch.I also feel the OnePlus 6T can no longer play the value for money card as strongly, either, as while I feel it is attractively priced for the spec, there are now a selection of devices that are much cheaper than it on the market that deliver an experience that also comes quite close to it, and for many users that will be a better value proposition.You also can't ignore that, if you can spend the money, of course, and I realise not everyone can, then you can get devices that beat it in various aspects. In my mind, the Google Pixel 3 XL, Apple iPhone XS, and Huawei Mate 20 Pro all deliver a better camera system, for example.It seems, therefore, that the OnePlus 6T truly seems to sit bang in the middle of the market fiscally, and does so while ruling it like a king, sure… but I'm not sure that's enough anymore to make it a shut-up-and-take-my-money, unreserved recommendation. And especially not when the device shares so much common ground with its previous incarnation.A technically impressive new flagship from OnePlus, then, but one that feels like an awfully safe play from the maker in an industry that is undergoing rapid, innovative change.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-6t-review
81,TCL 10 5G,TCL 10 5G review: 5G and a big screen on a budget,"The TCL 10 5G brings you 5G on a budget, and is the second smartphone to arrive from TCL after the TCL 10 Pro – a handset that's a bit more powerful and a bit more expensive than this one. If you want top connection speeds without paying a premium, it's worth a look.While the TCL 10 5G certainly isn't going to trouble any of the 2020 flagships in terms of power and performance, it has specs that mean it can hold its own in the mid-range section of the market – and considering the price, that means plenty of bang for your buck.That price is £399 SIM-free in the UK at the time of writing, though check the widgets on this page for the latest deals. That's the same price as the TCL 10 Pro, though this phone adds 5G and a bigger screen, while making do with slightly less powerful components.In the end, it really depends what you need most from a phone when it comes to choosing between the two handsets that TCL has on the market at the moment. Read through our full TCL 10 5G review to find out everything you need to know about the smartphone.The TCL 10 5G is currently available to buy direct from Three in the UK, with the phone costing you £399 without a SIM or a contract. Pricing on contract starts from £27 a month over 24 months with a £19 up-front payment – that gets you 4GB of data per month.The TCL 10 5G isn't available in the US, and at the time of writing TCL hasn't announced any plans to make it available in the near future either.The TCL 10 5G comes with a 6.53-inch, 19.5:9 aspect ratio LCD display, running at a resolution of 1,080 x 2,340 pixels. It's undoubtedly one of the best parts of the overall experience of the phone: this is a display that's bright and sharp, with thin bezels around the sides and a punch hole notch (the bottom chin of the phone is a little bit chunky side, but we can live with it).You also get something TCL is calling Nxtvision, which promises to boost vibrancy and colour range – it's like HDR even with SDR sources, TCL says. Based on our experiments with different apps and types of content, it certainly adds more punch and vibrancy to the display, but some users might find it a little too much. It's at least nice to have these display tweaks available if needed.From Netflix in full HDR10 mode, to games from the Google Play Store, almost everything you get up on the screen of the TCL 10 5G looks great. There's the option to have full screen mode include or exclude the punch hole notch, which is a handy setting to have, and there are a lot of other display tweaks available through the software menus (including dark mode, of course).There's a dedicated button on the left of the screen for launching Google Assistant, if those are the sort of hardware shortcuts that you go in for, and then the volume controls and the power button are on the right. You get a fingerprint sensor on the back, a USB-C port for charging and data charging, and a 3.5 mm audio jack for connecting up your wired headphones directly. Only one colour is available, Mercury Grey.The TCL 10 5G comes with no fewer than four different cameras on the back – 64MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, 5MP macro, and 2MP depth – but of course multiple lenses doesn't always necessarily mean quality shots (the Google Pixel 4a takes excellent snaps with just one rear camera). As is the norm for many budget phones, there's no telephoto optical zoom and no optical image stabilisation either.The photos we took with the TCL 10 5G came out looking good overall, and the ultrawide lens is handy to have if you want to fit more into a single frame. We found plenty of colour and sharpness in our snaps, though we don't think the handset can quite match the best phone cameras in this price range. Shutter speed is nice and fast, and for most people, the TCL 10 5G camera will do just fine.As is often the case with phones at this price, night shots can be a problem. If some light is available you can usually get a decent photograph, but capturing the photo takes a second or two. There's a dedicated Super Night mode that boosts dark spots even more though some advanced image processing techniques – while the resulting images are certainly brighter, we're not sure they're any better than the shots taken without the night mode, and capturing them takes even longer.As we get limited time with review units it's not always easy to assess battery life (especially as new phones come with brand new batteries), but we were easily getting through a day of use with the TCL 10 5G between charges. You won't make it to a second day, and you might run out of charge by the evening if you're really pushing the phone, so we'd say battery life is acceptable rather than spectacular. Our two-hour video streaming test knocked the battery down from 100 percent to 70 percent (with the screen on maximum brightness), suggesting 6-7 hours of streaming if you've ramped up the brightness and the Nxtvision settings.The very respectable Snapdragon 765G chipset from Qualcomm is powering everything here – the mid-range processor found in phones such as the OnePlus Nord and the LG Velvet – and it's accompanied by 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage (which you can expand with a microSDXC card. In terms of the specs list, this is one of the best deals you're going to get for the money.Those very competent specs do a commendable job in day to day use as well: we didn't notice any serious lag or any slowing down while we were testing out the TCL 10 5G. The Geekbench scores of 623 (single core), 1903 (multi core), and 1270 (OpenCL) put it ever so slightly ahead of the OnePlus Nord, but there's not much in it – and benchmarks don't always tell the full story in any case.As is normal for phones in this price range, the TCL 10 5G doesn't offer wireless charging or the best IP68 waterproofing. There is, however, 18W Quick Charge 3.0 wired charging for the battery. You get a single speaker for audio, which performs as well as you might expect – it's fine for movie dialogue and blasting out a few podcasts, but you wouldn't want to rely on it for high-fidelity music playback.Android 10 is running on board the TCL 10 5G: TCL hasn't messed with it too much, thankfully, but there are various aesthetic tweaks and a few apps that you're probably not going to use. It seems a bit pointless to have bespoke TCL apps for photos, files, notes and so on when the Google equivalents are mostly superior (all the key Google apps are preinstalled too).At a shade under £400 (check the widgets on this page for any cheaper deals), the TCL 10 5G is really good value for money – 5G is by no means a given at this price point, and on top of that you also get some decent specs, a decent camera, a nice big screen and a fairly slick version of Android.What might hurt the chances of the TCL 10 5G the most is that there are so many other excellent phones at this price. The £349 Pixel 4a takes better photos while the £419 iPhone SE 2020 has an arguably more polished operating system and much better performance – both those phones lack 5G though, of course. The £379 OnePlus Nord excels in most areas, while the Moto G 5G Plus has 5G on board and a bigger screen than the TCL 10 5G, while still hitting a starting price of just under £300.Weighing up the pros and cons of these various handsets isn't easy, and the TCL 10 5G can certainly hold its own – it just doesn't have that must-have feature or that bargain basement price that might draw your attention away from the other smartphones currently available around the £300 and £400 mark.All that said, we've been impressed by this and the TCL 10 Pro – the first efforts at smartphones from TCL. Both of these phones are worth considering for your next purchase, finding a smart balance between price, performance and features – they just lack a little something special in what's already a very crowded field.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/tcl-10-5g-review
82,Cat S42,Cat S42 review: an extra rugged phone for an affordable price,"The Cat S42 is all about being a durable and rugged phone, one of the latest handsets from the Caterpillar Inc brand (of construction machinery fame) under licence to Bullitt Group – Caterpillar Inc isn't actually making the phones, but it's the same sort of aesthetic.In terms of the Cat range, the S42 sits somewhere in the middle, without the advanced features or higher price of something like the S62 Pro. If you need a tough phone that you can basically take anywhere you go without worrying, then this handset is worth a look.Sure, other phones have waterproofing and can survive the odd fall, but the Cat S42 and its wider family can take some serious punishment: we're talking about bumps and scrapes on a level that you wouldn't experience around a normal home or office.As a result, the Cat S42 is only going to appeal to a niche audience – but if you fit into that audience then you might find it's the perfect phone pick for you. We've covered durability, battery life, performance, camera quality and more in our comprehensive Cat S42 review.The Cat S42 is currently available to preorder in the UK for £229, direct from the Catphones website or through the Clove retailer. A release in the US is planned, but as yet we're still waiting on an exact date.Shipping in the UK is expected around the middle of August with wider availability at other retailers and operators from October.The Cat S42 comes wrapped in a chunky, rubberised, non-removable casing that meets IP68 (waterproofing and dustproofing) and MIL-SPEC 810H military standards – so it's certified to withstand extremes of pressure, temperature, vibrations and drops. It's a lot tougher than your average smartphone, and it shows as soon as you take it out of the box.It certainly feels well protected and incredibly solid to hold, and the extra padding at each of the corners is a really clever touch as well. The phone doesn't feel too unwieldy – it weighs in at 220 grams or 0.49 pounds – but obviously all this additional protection adds some bulk to the handset. At 12.7 mm (0.5 inches) thick, it's not exactly going to glide into a pocket or a bag.The relatively small 5.5-inch IPS LCD display, offering a resolution of 1440 x 720 pixels, helps keep the device compact enough for one-handed use, just about. It's one of the weaker parts of the whole Cat S42 experience, and is certainly not as bright or as crisp as even a standard mid-range phone, but it gets the job done. It's fine for browsing through documents and webpages, and even for a bit of light movie watching.We do like the extra programmable key that the Cat S42 has included on its side: you can use it to turn the phone into a push-to-talk walkie talkie (with a suitable app), to launch any of the apps on your phone, or as a way to quickly access notifications, the flashlight, and more. If you're out in an environment where operating your phone as normal is tricky, it can really come in handy.The main and indeed the only reason you're going to buy the Cat S42 is because of its extra toughness, so we should start there. The phone can officially survive drops of up to 1.8 metres (5.9 feet) but unofficially we reckon it can take more punishment than that; it's also rated for lasting for 35 minutes in water at a depth of 1.5 metres (4.9 feet). From building site to nature trail, this is a handset that's going to last you.We don't feel particularly comfortable throwing gadgets around the house or the garden, but we tried to give the Cat S42 as much of a test as we could manage, lockdown and social distancing rules permitting. The claims on durability certainly seem to hold up from what we can tell, though we'll have to wait for our next wilderness adventure to give it a full test. It certainly survived drops of a significant height and being dunked in bowls of water while we were testing it. It's also worth noting that the phone is easy to clean, because you can use hot, soapy water.The Cat S42 does make some compromises with performance – there's a budget Mediatek Helio A20 processor and just 3GB of RAM inside, which means that day-to-day performance is hardly super-speedy. While you won't come across any lag that gets in the way of your normal phone use, there are occasional millisecond delays that you'll notice, and the phone is going to struggle with the most demanding games.There's just 32GB of internal storage, but you can expand this via a memory card if you need to. Software-wise, Android 10 is on board, with only a few little tweaks – we like the Toolbox app that guides you towards apps you might find useful (calculators, measuring tools, constructions apps and the like). For companies, the phone supports the features of Android Enterprise too, should you need them.Ordinarily, the phone camera would be one of the bigger considerations when it comes to choosing a smartphone; with the Cat S42, not so much. There's a single-lens 13MP camera on the back (together with a very bright flash), and a single-lens 5MP camera on the front – both of these get the job done but not really much more than that. If you need top-of-the-line photo capabilities, don't get the Cat S42.The phone is fine for some quick pointing and shooting, but if you need to take detailed snaps of documents or epic landscapes then you're better off looking elsewhere. Low light shots come across as pretty average, and you don't get the cool thermal camera capabilities that are available on some of the more expensive Cat phones – so no trying to spot wildlife in the garden in the dead of night.We were very impressed with the time you get between charges from the 4,200mAh battery: the phone usually drained by less than 50 percent during a day of (light) usage, and it's not inconceivable that you could get a couple of days between charges if you're careful. In our two-hour video streaming test, the battery level dropped from 100 percent to 84 percent – media playback is hardly a priority for this phone, but that does show the Cat S42 holds up very well against other handsets in this department.The phone also seems very good at holding its battery charge when it's not being used, going down just a small number of percentage points every hour when in standby. It should last many hours while tucked away in a pocket (of course the small screen and low-powered processor helps with that). It is worth noting that there's no wireless charging here, and the phone uses an older microUSB connection port.The Cat S42 phone really just has the one major selling point: its toughness. If you're not interested in a rugged phone then the Cat S42 won't be on your radar, but if you are looking for something that can take more punishment and resist damage better than most handsets then this definitely appeals.All Cat phones offer plenty of protection, but this is cheaper than most – it's the budget option if you're after a tough, easy to clean phone that is going to survive just about anything, and yet still runs everything you get on Android. We do like the curated section for app tools as well, which gives you some idea of what the Cat S42 can be used for.Aside from the way it's made, the Cat S42 doesn't have much going for it – but then again it doesn't necessarily have to. The internal components are definitely on the budget side, the screen is small and unlikely to wow you, and the camera isn't going to take photos as well as some other phones at this price point.You're really spending your money on all that drop protection, waterproofing, and military grade toughness – so if that's important to you then get the Cat S42 on your shortlist. If you have a bit more money to spend, check out the other rugged phones on the market, including the rest of the Cat line-up.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/cat-s42
83,Google Pixel 4a,Google Pixel 4a review: the budget Pixel strikes back,"The Google Pixel 4a is here, a little later than planned, and it follows the playbook of the much admired Pixel 3a – a cut-down, more affordable Pixel for those who don't want the big screen, multiple cameras, and premium-quality materials of the Pixel 4 flagships.Perhaps the most important detail about the Pixel 4a is its price: it's a smidge cheaper than the OnePlus Nord and quite a bit cheaper than the iPhone SE 2020, and that helps it stand out in what is a crowded part of the smartphone market at the moment.Everyone is making more affordable versions of their flagships now – Apple, Samsung, OnePlus – and that's before you get to phones from the likes of Xiaomi, Oppo, Nokia, Motorola and others that have been offering great value at this price point for years.What Google did brilliantly with the Pixel 3a was choosing the right bits to keep and the right bits to cut in order to get the price down. Has it managed to pull off the same trick with the Pixel 4a? Read on for our full review of the latest Google Pixel to find out.The Google Pixel 4a is available to pre-order now in the US, with a release date of August 20th 2020, for $349.In the UK October, the Pixel 4a will cost £349 and has a much later release date: October 1st 2020, with pre-orders open from September 10th.Google has also confirmed that a 5G version of the Pixel 4a (called the Pixel 4a 5G, appropriately enough) will be released towards the end of the year alongside the Pixel 5, and will start from $499.With a 5.81-inch, 1080x2340-pixel resolution OLED screen, this phone has a display a little bigger than the Pixel 4 (5.7 inches) and somewhat smaller than the Pixel 4 XL (6.3 inches). While the general trend is for ever-bigger phone screens, the Pixel 4a is relatively compact – which may or may not be to your tastes. It's the same size as the smaller iPhone 11 Pro.The bezels around the sides of the screen are pleasingly thin, and there's a single punch hole notch in the top left of the display for the selfie camera. Around the back there's matte plastic rather than the glass of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, and honestly we prefer the matte look.As with the Pixel 3a, there's no doubt when you hold the phone in your hand that it's a cheaper phone – but it doesn't feel too cheap. It's lightweight and plasticky, but it's also comfortable to hold, and it feels sturdy. You get the feeling that this is a phone that could take some punishment with or without a case, though we should point out that the phone isn't rated as waterproof or dustproof. There's a fingerprint sensor on the back, dual speakers at the bottom, a USB-C port, and – we're happy to say – a 3.5 mm headphone jack up at the top (there are wired earbuds in the box too).We kind of liked the dual-tone backing that the Pixels had before the Pixel 4 arrived, and even though that has fallen by the wayside, these Google phones still have a certain understated elegance to them. Having the power button a slightly different colour is a small but effective trick that's been done on previous Pixels, and it's back again here – the power button is a sort of green-ish white, as far as we can tell. Black is your only colour choice when it comes to the Pixel 4a.If it's not already obvious, there's no Pixel 4a XL – though there are rumours that the upcoming Pixel 4a 5G later in the year will have a larger screen. Overall, Google has done a decent job with the design of the Pixel 4a: phones like the OnePlus Nord and Apple SE 2020 feel a bit more premium to hold, whereas the Pixel 4a feels more ordinary and everyday, but that's okay. It's rather happy in its mid-range skin.Like the Pixel 3a, the Pixel 4a sticks with a single 12.2MP rear camera, though we're assuming it's the slightly updated lens found in the Pixel 4 phones – phones which also add a second telephoto lens. In other words, it's half the camera you get with the Pixel 4, but again Google's algorithms are working their magic to produce some really great shots considering the handset only has a single camera lens to work with.Shutter speed is responsive and snappy, colours are sharp and bright, dark and light areas are well balanced, and details are well retained even when photos are viewed up close. Once again, Night Sight is the star of the show, producing some almost unbelievable shots in low light if you can hold the camera steady for a couple of seconds – if anything they almost brighten the scene too much in some situations, leaving you with an eerie mix of daylight and nighttime in the same shot.As with the Pixel 3, Pixel 3a and Pixel 4 phones before it, the Pixel 4a can take shots of the night sky too. You can read more about the feature here. Through a combination of local lockdown rules, cloud cover and light pollution, we haven't been able to test the feature out so far – but we have previously tested it with the Pixel 4 XL and found it to work well. For astrophotography however, you need a tripod or some other prop to keep the phone steady for between two and four minutes.Speaking of the Pixel 4 XL, we were able to compare it directly with the Pixel 4a in some shots. We found the dual-lens rear camera on the Pixel 4 XL came out on top, as you would expect – but only some of the time, and not by a huge distance. The Pixel 4a actually comes very close to the flagship in the photography stakes, even in zooming: the software-based zoom gets close to the Pixel 4 XL optical zoom in terms of quality.If you want the very best Pixel camera, get the Pixel 4 or the Pixel 4 XL, but the Pixel 4a gets very close to the same quality for a fraction of the price. It looks as though camera quality is once again going to be a big reason to pick this Google mid-ranger, and it's definitely one of the best smartphone cameras we've seen at this price point – especially if you're shooting in low light situations.Given the time constraints on our phone reviews – and the fact that brand new phones boast brand new batteries that haven't started to degrade – it's always hard to give a definitive verdict on battery life at this early stage. What we can say is that the Pixel 4a seems to hold its charge very well, with the 3,140mAh battery still having around half its charge left at the end of each day. In our two-hour video streaming test, the battery dropped from 100 percent to 85 percent, which is above average (and equates to more than 12 hours of streaming between charges).If rumours are to be believed, the Pixel 5 will opt for the slightly-less-than-flagship Snapdragon 765G processor later this year, and the Pixel 4a goes a notch below that with the Snapdragon 730G. It's still a decent processor, especially with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of (non-expandable) internal storage alongside it – we didn't notice any kind of slowdown in performance when moving through apps and browser tabs, and the phone can cope with some heavy duty mobile games too (though you might be waiting a few seconds longer on the loading screens).Keeping the price down has meant some sacrifices – we've mentioned the lack of waterproofing, and there's no 5G here or support for wireless charging. With 5G now available in most of the big cities in the UK, the Pixel 4a isn't the most future-proofed phone on the market right now (the Moto G 5G Plus costs even less, and has 5G on board), but 4G should be enough to keep you going for the next two or three years until it's time to upgrade your phone again.More than ever, what you're buying with a Pixel phone is the Google experience: Google Assistant close at hand, instant access to Google apps, and the very latest versions of stock Android as they appear. The Pixel 4a comes running Android 10, but it's guaranteed to be one of the first phones in line when Android 11 rolls out later this year. It even has the cool Now Playing feature of other Pixels, which works like an always-on Shazam, identifying songs as they play in the background.Google Photos continues to get better and better, and will store all your photos and videos in the cloud for free if you don't mind them being downsized a little. To keep them at their original sizes, you can pay for more Google One storage once your free 15GB allocation has been used up – every Pixel 4a purchase actual comes with three months of 100GB storage for free, though presumably if you use that up within the allotted time period you then don't have much choice but to start paying up.The Pixel 4a is almost exactly what we expected – a modest upgrade on the Pixel 3a, and a more affordable alternative to the Google Pixel 4. The Pixel 4 starts at the significantly higher price of £669/$799 at the time of writing, which is a lot more to ask for a bit of a performance bump, a few camera upgrades (including telephoto zoom) and the ability to charge up your phone wirelessly.The Pixel 4a really is one for the Google fans. Android is clean and bloat-free, Assistant is easier to access (and more capable than ever) and you get Pixel exclusives like Night Sight for the camera, and the Recorder app that can use Google's artificial intelligence skills to convert spoken audio to text in real time. It's Google's mobile operating system, its apps, and its services in their purest form – something you can't really say about the other Android phones on the market.If screen size and quality, processor speed or 5G connectivity are more important priorities for you, then there are better phones around at this price point right now. It's a segment of the market that's getting more and more competitive with every passing month, and there are plenty more phones to come in 2020 yet. The Pixel 4a is up against some very strong rivals, so don't spend any more on this new Google phone until you've had a good look around at what else is out.The strengths of the Pixel 4a are the same as they always have been for the Pixel range: an excellent camera and arguably the best version of Android around (as well as the fastest system updates). Add to that respectable performance and battery life, and a phone that's well designed in an ordinary and unflashy kind of way, and the Pixel 4a is an interesting new proposition in the 2020 smartphone market.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/google-pixel-4a-review
84,Moto G 5G Plus,Moto G 5G Plus review: 5G is more affordable than ever,"The Moto G 5G Plus makes it clear, if it wasn't clear already, that 5G has arrived on phones that cost a little less – it's no longer a feature exclusively for expensive flagships, and here it's combined with Motorola's usual expertise at the affordable end of the phone market.Is it a successful blend of top-end connectivity and mid-range components? In this Moto G 5G Plus review we'll take you through all the key categories you'll want to know about – the phone's camera, battery life, day-to-day performance, design and build quality.Motorola's naming strategy for its phones can get a little confusing, but all that you really need to know is that this is the first Moto G phone with 5G on board. It's a bridge between the Moto G8 and (we assume) the Moto G9, sort of. There's no 'standard' Moto G 5G.There are already a pile of very affordable, good quality phones on the market – Motorola itself makes quite a few of them – but if you're after 5G and a big screen, as well as a better-than-average processor, then this is worth putting near the top of your shortlist.Motorola has a track record for making phones that are big and beautiful, if not quite as polished and refined as the very best handsets from Samsung and Apple, and the Moto G 5G Plus follows in this tradition: you get an expansive 6.7-inch, 1080 x 2520 pixel, 21:9 aspect ratio, HDR10-ready LCD display, with a 90Hz refresh rate – pleasing to see when a lot of affordable phones stick with 60Hz.We can also report that the screen is a pleasure to use as well. Movies, webpages, photos and more are clear, bright and easy on the eye. Admittedly you do need to ramp up the brightness on the display to get the best out of it (especially outdoors), and you don't get quite the contrast ratio and deep blacks as you would on an OLED display, but this is nevertheless a very capable screen that we were impressed by.Aside from the screen, Motorola has once again done a competent if unspectacular job on the design of the handset – which is an approach you'll be familiar with if you've used any other Moto phones. The phone is a little on the chunky and thick side, but not so much that it spoils the experience of using the phone, and aside from the rather stuck-on look of the quad-lens rear camera we're pretty pleased with the design of the Moto G 5G Plus.The Moto G 5G Plus moves with the times with a USB-C port on the base, along with a headphone jack that we still like to see on handsets. There's a single loudspeaker and a fingerprint sensor mounted on the side of the phone in the power button, which we actually prefer to having one on the back or under the display. Blue is your one and only colour option.The Moto G 5G Plus comes with a quad-lens 48MP wide + 8MP ultrawide + 5MP macro + 2MP depth rear camera, and there are also two lenses on the front – the 16MP wide + 8MP ultrawide selfie cam should help you fit a lot more in the frame. As with other Motorola cameras around this price point, the results are good but not spectacular, which is fair enough considering how much the phone costs.In pictures taken with the rear camera, colour balance and detail is good, though there is some fuzziness and blurring in places as the light starts to dim. Macro close-up shots can come out really well, as did portrait shots thanks to that depth sensor. Unless you're planning to run off some canvas prints then the quality of the Moto G 5G Plus won't disappoint, and the ultrawide angle lens is very handy – even if switching to it crashed the phone a couple of times, which was a bit worrying.At this affordable price you wouldn't expect miracles in low light photography, but the Moto G 5G Plus does okay – you can at least see what's happening in most night shots, even if colours are muddy and details are imprecise. There's a night mode which in some cases improves shots and in some cases doesn't make much difference – it's worth trying, but you need to keep the camera still for a second or two longer.While we weren't able to put the battery through a huge amount of testing, we can tell you that the large capacity 5,000 mAh battery inside the Moto G 5G Plus is going to have no trouble at all getting through a full day and then some, with normal usage. In our standard one-hour video streaming test, the battery level only dropped 10 percent from full, so you should be able to count on 10 hours of watching movies and shows between charges. 20W fast charging is supported too.The Snapdragon 765 CPU that Motorola has included here is a very respectable mid-tier processor, even if it doesn't quite hit the heights of the Snapdragon 865 or 865 Plus. Several phones at this price point are now going for the Snapdragon 765 or the 765G (with slightly more graphical power) and it's a sensible choice – it'll speed through almost any smartphone task, as the Moto G 5G Plus proves.With that Qualcomm processor you can have 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (like our review model had), or a slightly better 6GB and 128GB of storage – it's these specs more than the CPU that give away the Moto G 5G Plus' budget status, but we didn't notice any serious lagging or sluggishness in our time with the phone. If you like to keep a lot of music, movies and games saved to your handset, then you probably want to opt for the 128GB edition though.Running the latest Geekbench tests on the Moto G 5G Plus came up with a single-core score of 594, a multi-core score of 1842, and an OpenCL score of 1093 – benchmarks aren't everything, but those suggest this is comparable to a top-end Galaxy S series phone from 2018, which isn't bad at all. Generally performance seems to be fine – during a blast through Asphalt 9, for example, we only experienced one or two minor stutters.The Moto G 5G Plus runs a lightly skinned version of Android 10, and as usual, Motorola is very good at leaving Android alone – the bloatware and unnecessary embellishments are kept down to a minimum. Android being Android, you can always customise the operating system to suit your own tastes anyway, completely revamping it pixel by pixel if you feel that it's necessary.In a lot of ways, you already know what to expect from the Moto G 5G Plus in advance – Motorola has been pushing out good-quality budget phones for years now, and it has plenty of expertise when it comes to finding the right balance between power and performance. That's in evidence again with this handset.You get a lot of phone for your £300 or so – you get 5G, you get a powerful processor that can trouble the flagships of 2020 in terms of speed, and you get a large screen that we were impressed by. The battery life is significantly better than average, and those boxes are the ones that you want ticking, then the Moto G 5G Plus is definitely worth considering alongside all the other handsets around this price.Of course there are compromises along the way too. You don't get any waterproofing or wireless charging, the camera is good enough but not really any more than that (we really like the option of optical zoom on cameras, but it costs more), and the screen and build quality are some way short of what you would expect from a top-tier flagship from Samsung or Apple... which cost three times as much.Overall we came away from our time with the Moto G 5G Plus impressed with what Motorola has done with this handset, especially with the quality of the screen and how little you have to pay to get hold of it. If you like the design of the handset and you want to futureproof yourself with 5G as cheaply as possible, give it a look.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/moto-g-5g-plus
85,Oppo Reno 10x Zoom,Oppo Reno 10x Zoom review: camera class and stylish looks,"The Chinese expansion continues, with the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei, OnePlus and of course Oppo pushing their wares outside of Asia. The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom is one of the most capable phones yet to made the journey from the east, and we've been testing it out.The 10x Zoom, unsurprisingly, refers to the zoom capabilities of the camera. Strictly speaking though, only 5x of that is true optical zoom – the 10x zoom is actually a hybrid of optical and digital, with the phone actually capable of a massive 60x of digital zoom.It's an odd name to give the phone really, but that's Oppo's choice. What's also a little odd is the 'shark fin' style selfie camera that pops up out of the top of the phone when you use the front-facing camera. That means the display has very thin bezels, and no notch.SIM-free, the phone is going to cost you in the region of £700, which is a useful guide for how to think about the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom: not quite up there with the top-end flagships, but a little way above the mid-rangers (the OnePlus 7 Pro is similarly priced).As we've mentioned, the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom makes use of a pop-up selfie camera, which means no need for the notch. The fingerprint sensor is under the display, so the 6.6-inch screen covers almost all of the front of the device, giving the phone an impressive 87 percent screen-to-body ratio.Around the back, the aesthetic appeal of the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom continues – the three camera lenses are arranged in a vertical strip, which is then continued with some Oppo branding. We like the colours you can get this phone in too, namely a dark green, a ""mist pink"", and a more conventional black.An 87 per cent screen-to-body ratio makes for an immersive, big screen experienceAt 9.3 mm the phone is a little thicker than some of the ultra-premium flagships on the market, but not so much that it's going to spoil your enjoyment of it. The resolution is a mid-range-esque 1,080 x 2,340 pixels, but the display looks bright and vivid, with graphics and text both sharp and easy on the eyes.It's a phone that's comfortable to hold and to use, with a touch more grippiness than a lot of other smartphones on the market right now. It might lack the iconic looks of an Apple iPhone or a Galaxy Note, but by the end of our time with the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom we came away very impressed by the design, finish and feel of the phone.The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom is certainly no slacker in the specs and performance department, bringing with it a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 855 processor, up to 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of internal storage (you can add up to an extra 256GB thanks to the microSD card slot, too).For your main camera duties you've got a 48MP+13MP+8MP triple-lens rear camera, which came up with some fantastic shots in all but the darkest lighting conditions. We really liked the auto-identification feature that tries to recognise what you're photographing (a dog, a bunch of flowers, or whatever) and then makes adjustments accordingly – quite a few phones try and do this but on the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom it actually works.Given the name of the phone we should talk about that zoom. It's easy to operate and tweak, and you can get some great results at up to 5x zoom, and some very good results at higher levels of magnification. The 8MP lens is an ultra-wide one, so you can fit a lot more in the frame, if you need to – it's effectively 0.5x zoom.The 10x Zoom has a hybrid optical and digital zoomElsewhere the 4,065mAh battery will get you through the day and then some, and based on our Netflix watching we reckon you could get at least 10 hours of video viewing from a single charge (remember there's no notch, which improves the viewing experience). The phone isn't rated as waterproof though, and doesn't offer wireless charging.We get a lot of smartphones passing across our desks here at T3, and it's fair to say that at this point in the phone era, almost all of them are perfectly fine – a description that certainly applies to the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom. It has a good camera, good battery life, an appealing design... and a pop-up shark fin selfie camera.Why would you pick this phone over any other? Well that large, notch-free screen might be one reason. The variety and quality of the zoom modes is another – this phone comes with a camera that does well at adapting to all sorts of different conditions and use case scenarios. Price might be another reason to pick this over a top-end flagship (check the widgets on this page for the latest Oppo Reno 10x Zoom deals).A Snapdragon 855 processor and 8GB RAM give the Reno 10x Zoom plenty of powerIt's not all good news though – the Oppo version of Android (""ColorOS"") doesn't have much going for it, and we found ourselves pining for the stock Android experience of the Pixels (to be fair to Oppo this is a problem on a lot of Chinese handsets). Wireless charging and IP68 waterproofing are missing too.Overall though we're happy to recommend the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom – it's just that there isn't much that really stands out about it in what's an increasingly crowded market. You could certainly do a lot worse than the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom, but maybe you could do better as well.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-review-camera-class-and-stylish-looks
86,OnePlus 7T,OnePlus 7T review: beautiful iteration,"Screen: 6.55-inch
CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+
GPU: Adreno 640
RAM: 8GB
Storage: 128GB
Battery: 3,800mAh
Rear camera: 48MP + 12MP + 16MP
Front camera: 16MP
OS: Android 10Welcome to T3's official OnePlus 7T review. Over the past few weeks I've been putting the latest iteration of OnePlus' mid-year refresh through its paces and what follows is my considered take on the new handset.And, after personally reviewing the OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T last year, two phones that I gave four stars to, I have to say that right off the bat I got a strange sense of déjà vu when going hands on with the OnePlus 7T — you can tell straight away that this device shares the same DNA as those phones.Is that bad thing or a good thing, though? I think overwhelmingly it is a good thing, as OnePlus has been in the business of making quality handsets for a fair few years now (at least since the OnePlus 5). However, those who were hoping to see a break in this lineage will no doubt be slightly disappointed.The fact that the OnePlus 7T sails at times dangerously close to last year's devices, as well as - naturally for a mid-year refresh - the OnePlus 7, is also a consideration, and as someone who reviews a lot of phones, it was something I had to struggle at times to divorce myself from.Most people I am guessing who are looking at the OnePlus 7T are OnePlus 5T or 6T users, or - and this is very important to OnePlus right now I think - new users entirely who come to OnePlus from a different brand. Not everyone will have been on the bi-annual OnePlus train and if the Chinese maker is going to shed off its cult roots to grow, then new users is absolutely what it needs.Should OnePlus 6T owners be looking to upgrade? Or should they keep their powder dry for the OnePlus 8 next year? Does OnePlus need to go back to the drawing board in terms of how it approaches phone design? Or has it produced its most accomplished phone ever? Read on for some commentary.Before we get to the meat of the review, though, it is worth watching the OnePlus 7T's hype-filled launch video, which gives an overview of its highlight hardware and features.The OnePlus 7T costs $599 in the United States. That is for the 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage variant. That is a strong price point in my opinion. Right now, though, we have no idea how much the OnePlus 7T will cost in the UK, which is disappointing. Will it cost £599? Probably, but right now there is no way of knowing for sure.The exact price will, likely, be unveiled on the October 10 at the scheduled official OnePlus event, which should also see the official unveiling of the OnePlus 7T Pro.In terms of colourways, the OnePlus 7T is available in Frosted Silver and Glacier Blue.The OnePlus 7T is likely to be stocked on Amazon as well as the official OnePlus store.The OnePlus 7T comes with a  circular rear camera array.Take the OnePlus 7T out of the box and the first thing that grabs the attention is the phone's large and expansive 6.55-inch display. The screen, even when turned off, just seems to stretch wonderfully to each edge of the phone, and is only interrupted by the phone's tiny tear-drop front camera lens, which is situated top-center.Turn this screen on, though, and the Fluid AMOLED panel's real star quality makes itself known. It has a 90Hz refresh rate. This is the same panel used on 2019's OnePlus 7 Pro and, as we wrote then, the 90Hz screen equates to ""buttery smooth"" scrolling, swiping and transitioning.By refreshing at a higher rate than a smartphone's typical 60Hz, the fluidity of the screen is markedly improved to the eye, with any transition (scrolling, page turning, app switch etc) appearing incredibly slick and smooth. It sounds like a small point on paper, but the screen is the part of the phone that you use the most, like literally every time you pick up the device, so the fact it moves so well now to the eye is a major boon in my mind.And especially so considering the OnePlus 7T's screen also delivers 400 pixels-per-inch in terms of sharpness, which is in the range of so good it is imperceptible to the human eye, and strong peak brightness levels. It is also covered with Gorilla Glass, which imbues it with great levels of protection, too.With a 90Hz screen on tap, the OnePlus 7T delivers a buttery smooth viewing experienceIn terms of design, the OnePlus 7T looks very much like a slightly taller and thinner OnePlus 6T, which is thanks to a new 20:9 aspect ratio. On the front it is all screen, with tiny bezels running round each side, while if you flip it over you are met with a frosted-look, cold to the touch back panel, which on my review device was Glacier Blue.The rear camera array is circular and positioned top-centre of the phone. It is not flush, protruding a fraction out from the backplate (on this note, if you use an official case with the phone then the cutout is as such so the camera protrusion sits flush with the casing).Power button remains on the right hand frame edge, as too does OnePlus' distinctive manual silent mode switch, which is a personal favourite of mine. The ability to instantaneously kill all beeps, bongs and rings - even without having to turn on the phone is charming and on-point in an age where minimizing phone use is on-trend.Volume rocker remains on the left hand side, while charging and power (USB Type-C) and SIM card slot are located on the bottom, along with a speaker.Overall, I feel the OnePlus 7T is a very stylish phone. I personally prefer more retrained, less blingy phone finishes, so the cool and understated frosted finish on this handset appealed. I wouldn't say the circular rear camera array looks attractive, and the protrusion got me jittery about scratches when using the phone without a case, but it certainly isn't an eyesore, and if you use a case, then the protrusion disappears.Lastly here it is worth mentioning that, once more, OnePlus has not had an official IP rating for water and dust resistance attained for the phone. The phone is though resistant to these things according to the company. How you feel about that is something only you can decide.Mike Tyson said it best when he stated that ""speed kills"", and once more OnePlus has delivered a blindingly fast mobile phone in the OnePlus 7T. At its heart is a state-of-the-art Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus CPU, which along with the Huawei Kirin 990 currently is one of two market-leading Android processors. This a processor that is coated in cheetah blood, and the benchmarks prove it (see nearby boxout).In fact, the only processor that conclusively beats the 855 Plus is Apple's latest A13 Bionic processor as featured in the iPhone 11 range of phones, but that is largely immaterial in terms of real-world performance, and especially so when it comes round to OS and app performance on a day-to-day level. In terms of Android phones right now in 2019, the OnePlus 7T is blindingly fast.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 788Multi-Core Score: 2865[Compute]OpelCL Score: 2675Vulkan Score: 2333That Snapdragon 855 Plus is partnered with a healthy 8GB of RAM as well as an Adreno 640 GPU. These combine to deliver flawless performance in-app and in-game, with the phone delivering perfect results during testing while playing top Android games like Mario Kart Tour, Dragon Ball Legends, Hearthstone and Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery.This is obviously impressive, however I have said before that right now the default for any flagship phone is that it should run anything in the Google Play Store perfectly, so let's not get too carried away. I fully expected the OnePlus 7T to deliver in terms of performance, and it has done.Elsewhere in terms of hardware, the OnePlus 7T comes with 128GB of internal storage and, yes, there isn't a expandable microSD card slot. If you are a person who has to have huge internal storage space then maybe this isn't the device for you. For the vast majority of people, though, I feel that this storage quantity is more than enough.Yes, 128GB of storage is the minimum I would want to see on a flagship phone, but realistically I rarely blow over the 100GB level when using a phone long-term, so don't feel like this a shortcoming. More storage is always welcome, though, naturally.With Warp Charging on tap, keeping the OnePlus 7T juiced is fast and easyLastly, in terms of internal hardware, I feel I have to mention that the OnePlus 7T uses a 3,800mAh battery. That is a 100mAh increase over last year's OnePlus 6T and the exact same battery used in the OnePlus 7. It is also 300mAh less than the stack installed in the OnePlus 7 Pro.My reaction to this battery after testing? It is adequate but far from anything to write home about. You definitely get a day's usage out of it, and pretty heavy usage, too. For example, on a couple of all-day trips to London for briefings, whereby I was hotspotting the phone to my laptop so I could work on the train, using it for music, following Google Maps and taking in news and social media, too, I returned home with 13 to 23 per cent battery at around 6:30-7:30pm.So, yes, that is fine. But when you compare that performance to, say, last year's Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which could do that for going on two days between charges, the gap in battery life becomes evident.That said, though, OnePlus has equipped with the OnePlus 7T with its latest Warp Charge technology, meaning that the device can be juiced to 70 per cent in just 30 minutes. That's very convenient, but it does necessitate you having the Warp Charge charger and a place to plug it in.And, while we're on charging, the OnePlus 7T has not bucked the maker's recent trend in not including wireless charging. Again, how you will feel about this will largely depend on how you like to charge your phone. I like to charge my phone both ways, so am always a little disappointed that OnePlus doesn't include the technology, but you may feel it is an unneeded feature that would add to the cost. 🤷If you gave me a choice, though? I'll have a device with wired charging, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging. I love smart technology and features that make my life easier.The OnePlus 7T features Qualcomm’s rapid Snapdragon 855 Plus CPUCamera systems have never been a OnePlus specialism, but over the past couple of years it has really focused in this area and the result is that the OnePlus 7T has a fuss-free and highly competent camera offering.The rear array is made up of three cameras. You get a 48MP primary camera (26mm, f/1.6) with image stabilisation, a 12MP telephoto camera with 2x zoom (51mm, f/2.2) and a 16MP 117-degree wide-angle camera (17mm, f/2.2).Round the front, meanwhile, you get a 16MP (25mm, f/2.2) selfie cameraTo get a taste of the image quality captured by these cameras please consult the gallery of sample images below that I took while testing.I felt the images delivered were crisp and demonstrated solid colour reproduction and a pleasing lack of grain up close. Telephoto images tended to lean a little towards being washed out (check out the shot of the green man's face), though, and intra-image contrast was lacking a little something when compared to the best phones for photo taking (Huawei P30 Pro , Apple iPhone 11 Pro and Google Pixel 3 XL).In terms of shooting modes you get three main ones: photo, portrait, and nightscape. In each mode you can switch between cameras, too, with small circular symbols on the screen allowing transition from main camera to wide-angle for example.On the top bar of the camera system's UI you can also access things like shooting aspect ratio, which allows full screen, 4:3 and 1:1, flash, timer and macro mode. I found the OnePlus 7T's macro mode to deliver strong results, as can be seen in the below image of the flower head. Shooting in this mode is possible up to 2.5cm distance.Macro mode delivers fine detail up close.The 16MP front selfie camera delivers very detailed images, and when portrait mode is turned on - and in my case beautification is cranked up to maximum! - you get subtle smoothing and really rather nice, soft bokeh. Thankfully the technology in terms of beautification really seems to have now reached a level where you don't end up coming out like a younger wax work version of yourself. Less definitely is more in this regard, and I feel the OnePlus 7T gets this right.The OnePlus 7T's front-facing selfie camera captures fine detail well in portrait pictures, and with subtle bokeh.In terms of video the OnePlus 7T delivers a solid package as well, with 4K 60fps the most advanced shooting option on offer. Shot video is also stabilized as well. It is a simple offering, with nowhere near the level of options and modes offered on video-taking powerhouses like the Sony Xperia 1, but it works well, blending ease of use, raw speed and good end results well.And, I feel that good and simple idea kind of summates the OnePlus 7T's camera offering. It is not the best on the market for sure, but it seems to deliver good results across the board and makes accessing those results very simple and straightforward. I feel there is much to be said for offering the regular phone user such an experience.Photography enthusiasts will probably come away wanting more, but for me, this is the first time I've felt OnePlus has got its camera offering just right for its market position.Android 10 out of the box. 😎OnePlus long ago realised that only small changes to stock Android were necessary to make a truly engaging, unique and slick OS. And on the OnePlus 7T, a device that runs the brand spanking new Android 10 out of the box, with the Chinese maker's own latest version of Oxygen OS running over it, you have a truly special combination of intuitiveness, speed and advanced functionality.Navigating the OnePlus 7T is a pleasure, while neat features like Zen Mode (where you can shut off everything phone-wise for between 20 to 60 minutes; perfect for getting things done and not getting distracted) seem really user-focused and help imbue the system with its own character.I highly rate the OnePlus 7T.Part of me wonders if OnePlus has gone and rolled straight sixes here with the OnePlus 7T. And a part of me whispers that the phone is really not that different from last year's OnePlus 6T, let alone the OnePlus 7 from earlier this year, with marginal at best improvements in terms of camera performance, battery life and high-end features.However, every time I pick up the phone it just seems to come together to produce a refined and perfectly balanced mobile experience. It reminds me, to be truthful, of Apple, how the American maker seems to have long ago mastered how to produce sweet spot devices that, just, well… work.iPhones are, on the whole, devices that are super accessible, punch hard in certain core areas, and come together in the average phone user's hand in terms of experience. And that is despite often shedding advanced features that rival flagships have, or running a year behind in terms of incorporating new tech or features. This I feel best describes what OnePlus has managed with the 7T.Yes, the OnePlus 7T is business as usual from the cult Chinese maker, and if you have the OnePlus 7 or OnePlus 6T then I still think you need to seriously appraise whether you need to upgrade, but it also proof that iteration isn't necessarily a bad thing and, in fact, can often lead to truly beautiful results.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/oneplus-7t-review
87,Google Pixel 4,Google Pixel 4 review: the best Pixel yet might not be good enough,"The Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are Google's flagship phones for 2019, and we've been testing out the smaller 5.7-inch model over the past week – read on to get our thoughts on all the new features, including that extra telephoto lens, and a super-fast face unlock system.As with previous Pixels, the camera is the focus here, and the Pixel 4 can even take shots of a starry sky at night... provided you can keep it still for four minutes. A clean and fast version of Android 10 is on board as well, plus a few little extra goodies just for the Pixel 4.Those extra goodies include a Recorder app that's able to transcribe spoken words (from interviews or lectures) into digital text in real-time, something that's made possible with extra AI smarts embedded in the phone itself (so no need to keep referring to the cloud).Check the widgets on this page for the latest prices on the Pixel 4, but at the time of writing you can pick it up direct from Google for £669 (with 64GB of storage) or £769 (with 128GB of storage). The larger Pixel 4 XL starts at £829, so there's a hefty price jump between them. Those prices are actually less than the Google Pixel 3 when it launched, last year.In terms of its design and aesthetics, the Pixel 4 doesn't quite hit the heights of the Samsung Galaxy S10 or the Apple iPhone 11 Pro, for example – not with that chunky top bezel on the front and that blocky camera lens array on the back (which has the look of a prototype more than anything else).That said, it's not an ugly phone, especially if you go for the white or coral colours as a contrast to the back (these also have a matte finish as well, whereas the black Pixel 4 has a glossy backing). The sides are textured, which means a comfortable feel in the hand, but there's no doubt Google's competitors are outdoing it in the design stakes right now.The 5.7-inch OLED display on the Google Pixel 4 is crisp and brightThe 5.7-inch, 1,080 x 2,280 pixel, 19:9 aspect ratio, OLED display is perfectly fine, and we had no complaints in terms of colour, contrast, brightness, sharpness or anything else: it's a quality panel. It runs at a maximum refresh rate of 90Hz too, which means super-smooth scrolling and gaming – though the phone will adapt this refresh rate during the day to save on battery life.We're glad that the notch now seems to have been consigned to Pixel history, though we do miss the two-tone backing that previous phones in the series had. The Pixel 4 looks a bit nondescript without it, and if you add to that the rather daft-looking camera array on the back, it's not the best year for Pixel phone design.Since the original Pixel, these phones have been known for rocking some of the best cameras in the business, even with a single lens – Google's mastery of image processing algorithms has meant excellent image results. That continues with the Pixel 4, now with an added telephoto lens: there are few better phone cameras out there, though it's a shame you don't get an ultra-wide angle lens.In all kinds of scenarios, the Pixel 4 camera impresses, snapping shots with rich colour and great detail. The Night Sight mode that has wowed us on previous Pixels is here again, doing wonders with limited light, and this year it's even able to have a go at some astrophotography – provided you can keep the phone perfectly still for four minutes while pointed at the night sky, so it can capture enough detail.That telephoto lens really helps when zooming in, and combined with the Super Res Zoom digital processing the Pixel does, you can get right up close to the action. As you can see from the snaps we've embedded above, the Pixel 4 is a great choice if you want some of the best mobile photography tools at your fingertips.This is an area where Google's competitors are catching up, however, with Apple and Huawei now right up there with Google.Battery life is less impressive, unfortunately: the 2,800mAh battery just about makes it through the day with average-to-heavy use, so you may need to top it up during the evening if you've got a big night out planned. In our one-hour-of-Netflix test, the capacity dropped from 100-percent to 89-percent at full brightness and volume at half the maximum, which is a reasonably respectable score.Battery life is the Google Pixel 4’s weak point, with only a 2,800mAh stack installedThe Pixel 4 doesn't come with a fingerprint sensor, and nor does the Pixel 4 XL. Instead, Google is taking the Apple approach of relying on face recognition for the biometrics (though you can still have a backup PIN code). This is one feature that works fantastically well – by the time you've lifted up your phone to your face, you're in. You need never see the lock screen again, if you don't want to.One issue with this, however, is that apps which use your fingerprint for security (such as banking apps) will no longer work, and you'll have to revert to manually typing in your password until these apps get updated to accept face unlock.The face scanner is one reason the top bezel is so large; the other is Motion Sense, which utilises a tiny radar packed into the phone to allow you to skip songs, silence songs and more with a wave of your hand. We've seen this before in various guises from other manufacturers, and while Google's implementation works pretty well, it's not perfect – and we can't really imagine using it very much.What we can imagine using is the Recorder app, exclusive to the Pixel 4, which transcribes spoken audio in real-time as you record – perfect for interviews, meetings, and lectures. You can search through your notes with ease, and even run searches for ""applause"" or ""music"" (Google can recognise those too).The Recorder app works offline if needed, as Google has managed to embed some machine-learning artificial intelligence trickery on the device itself.Speaking of AI, Google Assistant gets better yet again, and should now be able to respond to queries more quickly and with less reliance on the cloud.The rest of the specs of the Google Pixel 4 are rather average – or at least average for a flagship Android phone in 2019. It comes with either 64GB or 128GB of storage and no memory card slot (the Note 10+ goes up to 512GB, with a memory card slot), plus 6GB of RAM (the OnePlus 7T Pro maxes out at 12GB), and the Snapdragon 855 CPU (which has been bettered by the Snapdragon 855+).Specs aren't everything, of course – Apple's iPhones famously get by on less RAM thanks to the software optimisations going on behind the scenes – but they are something. In just about every category you can find a phone that's beaten the Pixel 4 this year, which isn't a good look for a flagship launching after everyone else has had their go.The Pixel 4 is fully waterproof and dustproof, with an IP68 rating which means it can survive for up to 30 minutes in water at a depth of up to 1.5 metres. Wireless charging and fast charging are here again, as last year, and you can use the same Pixel Stand that launched alongside the Pixel 3 to turn your phone into a nightstand display.You've got USB-C or Bluetooth for audio, because the headphone jack is gone for good, and the phone also offers a good-quality pair of stereo speakers. They're fine for gaming, podcasts and movies, and at a push, they'll do for music as well.One important benefit of the Pixel range so far has been unlimited Google Photo uploads at the original quality – unfortunately that ends with the Google Pixel 4.The Google Pixel 4’s camera system is excellentThe likes of Samsung, Apple and OnePlus have made substantial steps forward with their handsets this year. Google has also made progress with the Pixel 4, in terms of the camera, Motion Sense, Face Unlock and integrated AI – but there are some misses among the hits as well, which you should bear in mind if you're thinking about picking one up.When it comes to the hardware design, and the internal components, and the battery life, the Pixel 4 is not much more than satisfactory. If Google wants to appeal to power users it needs to go further than a maximum of 128GB of internal storage and no memory card support, for example. Perhaps the mid-range is where the Pixels belong, after the excellent Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL.Yes, it's the best Pixel yet, but the improvements aren't big enough in comparison to the rest of the field – it feels as though Google has lost ground this year. The Pixel 4 still takes stellar photos, and the on-board AI (including Google Assistant) remains the gold standard that everyone else needs to beat... but that might no longer be enough for you to pick this over something else.The reasons to buy a Pixel phone are the same as ever with the Pixel 4 – that pure Android experience, the power of Google Assistant, and the magic that Google can do with photos (including astrophotography, this year). The Pixel 4 adds some nice touches as well, like Face Unlock and the Recorder app. Most of this is the AI and software at work though – and it feels as though the hardware side is less of a priority for Google.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/google-pixel-4-review
88,Sony Xperia 1,Sony Xperia 1 review: the best phone in the world for watching movies,"Dimensions:  167 x 72 x 8.2 mmWeight: 180 gScreen: OLED 6.5-inch, 1644 x 3840 pixels, 643 ppiCPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855RAM: 6GBStorage: 128GBBattery: 3,330 mAhCameras: [Rear] 12MP (wide), 12MP (telephoto), 12MP (ultrawide) | [Front] 8MPOS: Android 9.0 PieWelcome to T3's Sony Xperia 1 review. Earlier this month I spent a week testing out the Japanese maker's latest flagship phone and here is my considered take. As ever, I've evaluated the phone on many different criteria, ranging from design and screen, to specs and performance, and onto OS, software and battery life.For those who want an immediete takeaway from this Sony Xperia 1 review, though, then this is it. The Xperia 1 is, in many ways, a technical showcase that really reminds you just what quality Sony is capable of. However, it is also a technical showcase that still retains some issues that feel left over from the maker's difficult last five years or so in the mobile phone industry.As such, the finished product is one that lacks the all-round game that many of its major rivals like Samsung and Huawei demonstrate, which will range from minor annoyance to deal breaker depending on the individual in question. For my full take on the Sony Xperia 1 then read on.Some attractive bundle deals are available on the Sony Xperia 1.The Sony Xperia 1 costs £849.99 new and is available to buy right now from a wide-variety of retailers including the official Sony store, Amazon, Very, Carphone Warehouse, Currys, Fonehouse, Metrofone, Buymobiles, GoMobile, and Mobilephonesdirect.The phone can also be picked up directly through a selection of UK networks, too, with EE, O2, and Vodafone. Right now Vodafone if offering an Xperia 1 PS4 bundle deal whereby if you pick up the phone on a Pay Monthly contract then you get a PlayStation 4 Slim along with a copy of Spider-Man for free (click the link or banner image above to check the deal out).My analysis of the Sony Xperia 1's price point, especially contract free, is that it is £50 to £100 too expensive. It must be hard to build a phone with such impressive technical highs while keeping the price down, but in charging £849.99 for the entry level spec, and on a phone with a few features that are less than ideal, Sony are asking for properly serious amounts of money. More money, for example, than the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is going for right now on Amazon, and by quite a way, too (the S10 Plus is currently available for £723 at the retailer).There's no doubting that the Sony Xperia 1 carries a premium price point.Android 9.0 Pie comes installed on the Xperia 1 and it is only lightly skinnedThe Xperia 1 is without doubt a tall phone.Take the Sony Xperia 1 out of its box and the first thing you notice is just how tall and slender it is. That 21:9 aspect ratio screen just seems to go on and on, and after slipping it in the pocket and sitting down, it immediately becomes apparent that this is not a pocket friendly phone.I ride a Kawasaki Ninja 650 motorbike 😎 and, with the Xperia 1 in my jeans pocket, it was an incredibly uncomfortable experience. Does that mean I hate the big screen? Absolutely not. I am huge proponent of big screens as anyone who reads T3 regularly will know, and will plump for a device with a large screen more often than not, but it is worth noting that this is a carry in the bag phone primarily.The OLED screen on the Xperia 1 is gorgeous and makes doing anything on the device a visual pleasure.And, simply put, you'll want to grant maximum protection to the Xperia 1 as that screen is an absolute stunner. 4K, HDR and OLED together is super powerful mix and delivers a screen that, arguably, is the absolute best looking on the market today. Crispness, colour reproduction and contrast between the lightest and darkest areas of the screen are just superb on the Xperia 1, and make everything from browsing the internet and using apps, through playing games like Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, and onto viewing photos and watching videos a proper joy.And don't even get me started on how good the screen is if you actually feed it 21:9 movie content. Watching movies like Sergio Leone's classic western, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, was simply god-tier (check the sample images below), with the movie's gorgeous long shots, expansive wide-open locations, and detailed, character-filled close-ups really presented beautifully.Now, of course, not all content is delivered in 21:9, so it is important to note here that not everything you watch is going to make use of all that display real estate. However, almost all new content today is shot in 4K and, in many cases, with HDR support, too, so there's no escaping the quality of this Bravia team-designed super screen.The 21:9 aspect ratio on the Xperia 1 is markedly different from most phonesOne area where the Xperia 1's screen is definitely not quality, though, is in its maximum brightness. I found that I had to keep the phone on maximum brightness to feel happy with it during daylight hours, and really during most applications. Colour and crispness of images on the phone's OLED screen are top tier, and naturally I wanted to enjoy them at their max, which at stock brightness levels I simply could not do.I am convinced that this low brightness is directly connected to, as we will see further on, underwhelming battery.The monstrous bezels of Xperias past have, thankfully, been well and truly banished with the Xperia 1.Wrapping up the design, the Xperia 1 features Gorilla Glass 6 both front and back (very nice!) and has a lush brushed aluminium frame. Corners are rounded, and all the device's buttons, which include power, volume and camera, are located down the right hand side of the phone.And talking of the right hand side of the phone, that is also where the device's fingerprint scanner is located. I will come back to that later.On the bottom edge of the phone is the Xperia 1's USB-C charging, data-transfer and (via bundled connector) headphone port. There is also one of the phone's two speaker grills, with the second positioned in the front notch. Lastly, an extractable SIM card / microSD slot finishes off the exterior features.Overall, the Xperia 1 is an attractive if not jaw-droppingly stunning smartphone that communicates a mature, professional look. It is an order of magnitude away from the monstrosity that was the Sony Xperia XZ Premium though, which lest we all forget, was only two years back. The head-bangingly huge bezels on that fugly device have, thankfully, been well and truly confined to the past and Sony has rapidly switched up its aesthetics to remain competitive with its rivals.With Dolby Atmos and a 4K screen, the Xperia 1 is great for watching moviesPacking the cutting-edge Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor, the Xperia 1 has power to spare.That strong start in terms of design and screen is then continued in terms of the Xperia 1's specs and hardware. Qualcomm's finest Snapdragon 855 mobile processor, along with 6GB of RAM and an Adreno 640 GPU and, unsurprisingly, the benchmark scores it delivers are top tier.As can be seen in the nearby box out, in GeekBench 4 the Xperia 1 posted an absolutely incendiary Multi-Core score of 11,245, which for context, blows past every Android phone we've tested this year, including the powerhouse Samsung Galaxy S10, which could only manage 10,347 in the same test.[CPU]Single-Core score: 3,506Multi-Core score: 11,245[Compute]RenderScript score: 7,406[Battery]Battery score: 4,138Single-Core performance isn't as impressive, with a modest 3,506 racked up, however when these numbers are evaluated in terms of real-world performance, it is obvious that the Xperia 1 is a very, very fast phone. Opening and closing apps, loading a myriad of browser windows, split screen operation, installing games, navigating the UI and more is just an instantaneous, lag-free experience. And this speed partnered with the luxe screen leads to a very pleasing visual experience.And talking of performance, it would be amiss of me to not mention how pleasing I found the Xperia 1's audio playback options and reproduction. Dolby Atmos virtualization as well as DSEE HX Hi-Res audio upscaling tech on tap means that, especially if you are using a quality pair of wired headphones, listening to music and spoken word content like podcasts and audio books is zero-compromise good.Audiophiles will be pleased with the Sony Xperia 1.Lastly, in terms of Xperia 1 performance, I am pleased to confirm that the phone absolutely smoked every mobile game I threw at it, including Harry Potter: Hogwards Mystery, Tekken, DBZ Legends, Super Mario Run, Final Fantasy XV: Pocket Edition and Ultimate Car Driving Simulator. For gamers, the Xperia 1 is a great choice.The Xperia 1 carries Sony's best mobile camera system to date.The Xperia 1 features Sony's best camera system to date, with a main 12MP rear camera (f/1,6, 26mm) partnering a 12MP 2x zoom lens (f/2.4, 52mm) and a wide angle 12MP lens (f2.4, 16mm) round the back, and an 8MP (f/2.0, 24mm) camera round the front.The rear camera array can record up to 4K, HDR footage at 24 or 30 frames per second, while the front camera can capture 30fps, 1080p HDR footage. As mentioned above in the design section of this review, the Xperia 1 is rather unique in that it has its own dedicated physical camera button that lets you raise the system, focus and snap. It feels pleasingly old school and works well.Sony's mobile camera systems have, in the past, leant a little too much towards grain for my liking, however I was impressed with the natural, dynamically lit shots taken by the Xperia 1 during testing. The camera UI itself is very serviceable, too, making it easy to switch between modes and tweak settings.I also warmed to Xperia 1 features like eye-tracking and smart scene detection, which again helped flesh out the user-experience side of the camera system, which Sony has in the past had a tendency to forget despite delivering excellent hardware.Overall, the Xperia 1 delivers a strong all-round camera system for shooting still images and videos, however I feel it falls slightly short of the best systems on the market today, such as those found in devices like the Huawei P30 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. It certainly isn't disappointing, though, and in partnership with the Cinema Pro app people who like to shoot their own videos are going to be very happy.The Xperia boasts a three-camera array on its rear.In terms of battery performance, unfortunately this is where the Xperia 1 is really at its weakest. As soon as I saw the 3,300mAh battery spec I knew performance was going to be less than ideal (I review a lot of smartphones), and sure as eggs are eggs, the Xperia 1 not only returned bog average benchmark scores (4,138 in GeekBench 4) but also was very firmly in the one day usage camp per charge in the real world.For a bit of perspective here, the Huawei P30 Pro scored 6,650 in this test and could comfortably be used with medium usage for two days straight on a single charge, while the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus notched up a score of 5,020, too, and was comfortable for at least a day and half of usage per charge. Elsewhere, the Honor View 20 bagged a score of 6,614 in this test, and that phone is currently retailing for under half the price of the Xperia 1.And when you then realise that the phone's other most notable flaw, its lack of screen brightness unless cranked right up, is connected with this underwhelming battery, you can't help but think what the phone would've been like with even a Huawei Mate 20 Pro-level battery. Both battery life and screen brightness issues I am sure would have been rendered moot.The Cinema Pro app makes shooting videos a pleasure.In terms of OS the Xperia 1 delivers a refreshingly close-to-stock version of Android 9.0 Pie, with a few Sony-specific extras thrown on top like gestures, side-sense functionality and proprietary apps. The OS runs like a dream and anyone who is familar with stock Android phones or Sony's recent efforts like the Sony Xperia XZ3 or Xperia XZ2 Compact will find themselves with an easy transition.The only other major software of note is the Xperia 1's new Cinema Pro app. This powerful video-shooting application allows you to really tap into the phone's recording power by being granted control over resolution, aspect ratio, lens size, colour filters, shutter speed, white balance, frames per second and more. It's a really nice inclusion and reminds you of just how much top technology is packed into the Xperia 1.I was also a little disappointed to discover that while the Xperia 1 is IP65/IP68 rated (dust and waterproofing), it does not have wireless charging functionality.Lastly, I feel it is important to note that I found the Xperia 1's side-mounted fingerprint sensor to be very fast but inconsistent. There's no denying that when it works it works very well, but within days after registering my fingerprint, I experienced a small degradation in unlocking consistency, which led to around 1/5 attempts not registering. Compared to the under-screen, spacious, and more consistent systems installed in some of its current competitors, the Xperia 1's felt like a step down.Overall, the Sony Xperia 1 is a phone that will appeal to tech enthusiasts and movie lovers.For avid movie watchers and/or makers, film aficionados if you will, then the Sony Xperia 1 is simply the best phone on the market today. That 21:9 aspect ratio finally makes sense partnered to a super spacious and high quality 6.5-inch 4K HDR screen, with films and more cinematic TV shows looking simply amazing on the panel.The Xperia 1's OS and in-app performance is also top tier, with the incendiary Snapdragon 855 providing buckets of power, and a solid (if not spectacular) supporting suite of hardware and features bestowing a look, feel and general use of a high-end flagship phone.The Sony Xperia 1 is a very professional looking device.Start scratching at the surface for too long, though, and a smattering of tiny shortcomings become evident. The battery performance is just not as good as the other flagship devices on the market today, with the Huawei P30 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, and even OnePlus 7 Pro delivering better battery benchmark scores and real-world performance.For such as the Xperia has a quality screen, it just doesn't sit bright enough when adaptive brightness is turned on (by default it is), and I found myself within hours of first use cracking brightness up to the maximum and turning adaptive brightness off. It's not good having 4K resolutions, HDR wizardry and a super spacious 21:9 aspect ratio if everything you watch on it is washed out and flattened through dimming.As I mentioned above, I am guessing this lack of brightness with adaptive on is a direct result of the underwhelming 3,300mAh battery unit.A lack of refinement in terms of supporting features and systems also niggle, with the lack of a proper, competitive with rivals night mode, as well as wireless charging functionality and consistency in the fingerprint reader most notable.What also definitely doesn't appeal is the phone's out-and-out top-end, flagship-grade price point, which at £849 is even more than the best phone in the world right now, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.However, that all said, there is a hell of a lot of quality phone on offer here, and one that for fans of watching and creating videos, should appeal massively, and especially so if they can look past the aforementioned shortcomings.Sony has played to its strengths, finally, with the Xperia 1 and it shows, with the Japanese maker producing a technical showcase in areas where it has proper heritage and expertise. I can't wait to see what they do next, as I feel with a few improvements here and there, if they keep this current vision they could be on the verge of creating something very special indeed.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/sony-xperia-1-review

Front camera: 10MPWelcome to T3's Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ review. Over the past few weeks I have been testing out the South Korean maker's new technical leader and what follows is my take on the fantastically sized new flagship.And that large size is important, as for the first time in the series' history, Samsung has concurrently released two Notes at the same time, the 6.3-inch Galaxy Note 10 and this 6.8-inch Galaxy Note 10+.As such, for Android phone fans who have a soft spot for Samsung's stylus-toting phone series, there is now a serious choice to be made when going Note, and especially so considering the screen size is not the only difference to consider.Hopefully, this full review, which breaks the phone down into a variety of key scoring categories, will go someway to making that decision clearer for potential upgraders.Last year I reviewed the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 for T3 and was very, very impressed with the overall package. It dripped ""with a level of premium and capability"" that made it the best Android phone in the world at launch, and even today it remains a superb all-round device.With that being the case, though, what role is there on the market for not just the Note 10, but a super-sized, super-costly, engorged Note 10+? It is not an easy question to answer and, simply put, I don't think it will be an easy decision to make for many people.If you absolutely have to have a quick, immediate takeaway from this Galaxy Note 10+ review, though, then I'd say that despite this phone being technically the best Note on the market, as well as the best phone Samsung has ever made, I feel most people will be better suited plumping for a regular Note 10, or even last year's Note 9, which is now half the price of the model reviewed here.To find out exactly why, as well as just how the Note 10+ performed on test, read on.A 5G variant of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus is availableThe Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ ships in three colours – Aura Glow, Aura Black, and Aura Pink. The Aura Glow is an undefinable blend of a handful of colours that is incredibly reflective and appears in a different shade each time it catches the light.In the official marketing images from Samsung, it looks remarkably like the shimmering finishes seen on the Huawei P30 series, but it’s not quite as pleasant as that in the flesh. It’s too reflective to really let the colours shine in our opinion.All variants of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 range are now on sale. The Galaxy Note 10 starts from £899 for the 4G model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of built-in storage, while the Galaxy Note 10+ costs £999 for the 256GB variant, and maxes-out at £1,199 for the 5G-enabled handset with 512GB of storage and 12GB of RAM.The package you get when you pick up a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. Note the bundled AKG earphones.T3 were pretty effusive about the Galaxy Note 10 in our hands-on review, and how its new compact design just feels right. Unfortunately the same can’t quite be said of the Note 10+, which is a rather unwieldy slab of glass and metal. Being completely honest, holding the handset for the first time is reminiscent of the engorged Galaxy S10 5G.Of course, there are huge benefits to a bigger screen, though – from watching films and box sets on your morning commute, to showing off holiday snaps to friends, reading eBooks on a flight, and getting immersed in the latest blockbuster mobile game.And with the Galaxy Note series, there are even more advantages to the mammoth display, which makes for a much larger canvas for handwritten notes, lets you see and annotate more of a PDF or webpage without constantly having to scroll, and means the smartphone functions as a bigger trackpad when using DeX.The expansive 6.8-inch AMOLED HDR10+ display on the Note 10+ will handle all of that brilliantly, but after some extensive usage, carrying around this smartphone every single day definitely leads to storage and transportation compromises — pockets friendly it certainly isn't.It is also important to note here that the power button, which is left-mounted on the Note 10+ along with the volume buttons, now doubles as the Bixby button (more on that chap later).There are huge benefits to a bigger screenWith the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10+, Samsung has relocated the titular O-shaped cut-out in the Infinity-O design. While the Galaxy S10 series kept the hole, which houses the front-facing camera and helps the company achieve that impressive screen-to-body ratio, in the top right-hand corner of the screen and the Galaxy A8s squirrelled its into the top left, the Galaxy Note 10 keeps its embedded camera dead-centre.According to Samsung, the decision to move the hole-punch was taken due to customer feedback on the Galaxy S10, where the in-display camera forced Samsung to shift system icons away from the right-hand corner of the UI.The new design is definitely better than the Galaxy S10 look. But it’s still pretty inelegant in my opinion. The new hole-punch means the system icons still reside in the top left- and right-hand corners of the display, just like every other Android-powered smartphone, which is good. But the cycloptic appearance of the Note 10+ isn’t something that could ever credibly be described as “beautiful” – something that most definitely could be said of earlier Galaxy Note models.However, if the much maligned notch on the iPhone X has taught us anything, it’s that it’s very easy to get used to an intrusion in the middle of the screen.Overall I think it is fair to say that the Note 10+'s design is attractive but not beautiful, and its massive form factor does take a little something away from what is actually a very minimalist, streamlined design.What a combo!As you’d expect from Samsung's technical leader, the Note 10+ has a very formidable specs sheet that reads more like a laptop's than a smartphone's. Powering the device is a new seven-nanometre Exynos 9825 chipset that delivers faster speeds (see benchmarks boxout) and greater power management than the impressive Exynos 9820 inside the Galaxy S10 series.That state-of-the-art silicon is coupled with 12GB of RAM and a choice of either 256GB or 512GB of built-in storage. Unlike the Note 10, the Galaxy Note 10+ does include a microSD slot which can be used to add up to 1TB of additional storage, so you’re unlikely to ever run out of space on this handset, with a maximum possible storage of 1.5TB beating many laptops, let alone other phones.A maximum possible storage of 1.5TB beating many laptops, let alone other phonesThe screen is without doubt one of the most jaw-dropping features about the Note 10+ and, if I am being honest, the main reason why anyone would plump for the handset over its smaller brother. The 6.8-inch, 1440 x 3040 at 498 ppi, AMOLED screen is a thing of true beauty, with the South Korean maker's usually super strong vibrancy, contrast and sharpness once more on display, but now at a truly staggering size.Indeed, thanks the massive screen size, pin-hole camera and minimal bezeling, the flagship phone now enjoys a staggering 94.7% screen-to-body ratio, up from 83.9% on the Galaxy Note 9. This makes a massive difference in the display of content and also, naturally, use of the S Pen digital stylus, with a now phenomenal amount of screen real estate in which to make notes, illustrate and navigate online.[CPU]Single-Core Score: 712Multi-Core Score: 1,808[Compute]OpenCL Score: 4,087Vulkan Score: 2,594After recently spending serious time with the Sony Xperia 1, with its stunning 21:9 Bravia-engineered panel, which was only let down slightly by that phone's underwhelming battery, the Note 10+ definitely had a tough act to follow and, while I would say the Sony phone is still the device I would prefer to watch 21:9 movie content on, for everything else the Note 10+ is either the Xperia 1's equal or superior.Performance is, as you can seen from the nearby boxout, top level. That combination of Exynos 9825, Mali-G76 GPU, and 12GB of RAM means that anything mobile you throw at this phone it will deal with comfortably.As you would expect, that hardware translated to a buttery smooth user experienceAnd, as you would expect, that hardware translated to a buttery smooth user experience in-app, in-game, and when navigating the phone's user interface. Lag and waiting is definitely not something that you have to deal with when using the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.And, while I couldn't test out the feature, I am confident that the hardware package delivered here will mean the phone will perform admirably in Samsung DeX, bolting on a light computing experience to the overall package, too.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus boasts a massive 6.8-inch AMOLED screenThe Galaxy Note 10+ comes with a strong all-round camera system, with plenty of lenses and shooting modes.Unlike the Galaxy S10 5G, the similarly-proportioned Note 10+ sticks with the same single 10MP front-facing camera with f/2.2 seen on the smaller Note 10. It’s interesting to see Samsung move away from the dual-selfie system used on the Galaxy S10 Plus and the Galaxy S10 5G.Thankfully, that means the hole-punch in the display stays relatively small – unlike the pill-shaped eyesores seen on the larger variants in the Galaxy S10 range. Over the period of time I spent testing the handset, photographs from the Note 10+'s front-facing camera looked good – with plenty of detail that will survive more than a few edits before being posted to Facebook and Instagram.Colour reproduction and crispness of image was high level on the Note 10+.Like the Note 10, the Note 10+ also supports Live Focus photos from the front-facing camera, so you can add an artificial bokeh-style blur behind your face.Samsung has also thrown-in a few wackier looks for those who want to stand-out from the endless sea of bokeh-filled selfies, including a new “Glitch” effect that gives the background the appearance of a badly maintained VHS – with tracking and stuttering colours. It’s not something you’re likely to use all that often, but it’s a fun new addition nonetheless.In terms of rear-facing lenses, you get a 12MP wide-angle camera with the same variable aperture technology seen on the Galaxy S10 range – allowing the camera to instinctively switch between f/1.4 and f/2.4 to capture images in challenging low light conditions, a 16MP ultra-wide with a 123° field of view, and finally, a 12MP telephoto camera that handles 2x optical zoom and Live Focus shots.This smart AI feature in the Note 10+'s camera system allows graphics and decals on objects to be scanned and saved on the phone as separate, 2D image.If that list sounds at all familiar, it’s because it’s the same mixture of ultra-wide, telephoto and dual-aperture found on the Galaxy S10 Plus – so you’ll find exactly the same photo options, including the artificial adjustable bokeh blur Live Focus photos.LiveFocus portrait in action.Like the selfie camera, you’ll also get the same Live Focus options from the rear-facing set-up, including ""Glitch"" and ""Circles"", which adds circular bokeh-style blur behind the subject. Like the Galaxy S10 5G, the Note 10+ is capable of adding these Live Focus effects to video in real-time.It’s a really nifty trick that no other smartphone has managed to match – at least for the moment.It’s a really nifty trick that no other smartphone has managed to matchWhere the Note 10+ differs from the smaller Note 10 is how it achieves this Live Focus effect. While the latter uses software to identify the subject of the image, the Note 10+ is fitted with an all-new patented DepthVision camera, which includes two separate sensors. This is different from the single Time Of Flight sensor used to achieve a similar effect on the Galaxy S10 5G.What a guy!This DepthVision camera, simply put, allows for enhanced bokeh-style blur behind the subject in photos and videos. I feel it also offers more accurate results when measuring distances, or placing computer generated objects into the real-world using Augmented Reality (AR) apps.After spending some time testing Live Focus, I have to admit that photos and videos looked very impressive. However, there didn’t seem to be much difference to my eyes between the software-based solution on the Note 10 and the DepthVision-powered Note 10+.And speaking in terms of video, as well as slow motion and a variety of other recording modes, you can shoot at 4K, 60fps on the Note 10+. Nice.Yep, AR Emoji is back, and you will still look nothing like yourself. At least you now have more clothes to choose from.Lastly, in terms of camera system, it would be amiss if I didn't talk about AR Emoji. Last year, when I reviewed the Galaxy Note 9, I commented that ""creating your AR Emoji with the camera system is super easy"", praising how fast the process was. I didn't like how generic the avatars were, though, nor how few styling options you were given.This time round I feel Samsung has moved even further away from an accurate portrayal of the subject for a more cartoony, Pixar-style approach. My avatar, even after some serious tweaking, still looked very little like me. The phone maker has addressed the lack of customization, though, and there are now far more outfits and accessories to choose from.Um... people like this, so I am told.Stickers and animal avatars also return once more, so if that is your bag, then you can make shocked face as a sloth, or get daemonic if your significant other informs you that they ate the last wagon wheel in the cupboard.The Note 10+'s audio system has been tuned by audio maestros AKG. Through a decent pair of can its sounds good.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 has a large 4,300mAh battery cell that, from my testing with the phone, is good for a day and half of moderate real world usage. This isn't as strong as some other flagships, such as the Huawei P30 Pro, which is good for two days between charges, but for a phone with such a big screen and internal spec, I feel is actually good. I never had any battery anxiety when using this device and, well, that's a mark of endorsement from me.When the Note 10+ does run our of juice, though, it supports speedy 45W wired charging which can refill the handset with enough power to last an entire day in just 30 minutes. That’s seriously impressive and almost stands toe-to-toe with the Warp Charging included with the OnePlus 7 Pro, which has been almost unmatched since its introduction earlier this year.The large 4,300mAh battery is good for a day and half of moderate real world usageIf you’re not willing to cough-up for a 45W wired charger, Samsung still includes a 25W fast wired charger in the box, which should be plenty for those who leave their smartphone charging overnight. The Galaxy Note 10+ also supports 15W fast wireless charging pads, too, which is nice coming off a couple of recent launches where the maker did not include a wireless charging (or reverse wireless charging functionality).In terms of audio and other notable features, the Note 10+ includes sound tuned by AKG, which is plenty loud enough to enjoy a YouTube video without headphones, and Wireless PowerShare – which allows you to charge Galaxy Buds or any other Qi-compatible gadget by placing it on the back of the handset. I found the audio reproduction, both over wired and wireless headphones, to be good.While we're on audio, I feel I need to point out (sigh) that the Note 10+ does not have an audio port, with Samsung following OnePlus in ditching it so that a bigger battery could be used. I feel this ""issue"" is largely rendered moot as Samsung includes a pair of decent USB-C wired AKG headphones in the box. Yes, no USB-C port to headphone jack dongle is included but [checks Amazon] they can be picked up right now for £3.19. And, simply put, if you can spend £1,000 on a phone then I think you can stretch the extra few quid.This year the S Pen allows you to perform Air Gestures.God I hate Bixby. There, I said it. At the start Samsung's own AI system was much akin to Bertie Wooster in my mind — had a funny name, didn't operate properly and got into mishaps, before being eventually let off with a ""AI will be AI"" slap on the wrist and a ""C- must try harder"" write up.And here we are two years down the line from Bixby's launch alongside the Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones and, despite numerous updates, it still is just nowhere near the level of reliability, useability and usefulness of either The Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. It is, for all the hype and gloss, at best a thoroughly average voice assistant and, at worse, something you wish you could, literally, crowbar out of the phone.Is it a deal breaker? No, obviously not. But I do feel Bixby has outstayed its welcome now. It needs to get better fast. My suggestion to anyone who picks up one of these phones? Remap the double tap on the power button to open The Google Assistant app.The Galaxy Note 10 Plus’s Digital Stylus is highly functional and usefulSamsung's own AI system was much akin to Bertie Wooster — had a funny name, didn't operate properly and got into mishapsIn terms of fingerprint security, unlocking the Galaxy Note 10+ is handled with an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint scanner – just like the Galaxy S10 series. Samsung has moved the sensor a little higher up the frame this time around, so it falls in a much more natural position when holding the phone.After some extensive usage of the unlocking feature, as well as the face unlock function, I can confirm that both are among the very fastest and most consistent I've used to date. Place you thumb or finger on the screen for but a moment and the phone unlocks, while if you simply pick up the Note 10+ and press its power button, if you have facial recognition on then again, almost instantaneously, the your face is invisibly scanned and the home screen reached.These security features, along with a suite of more traditional methods such as pin unlock (which is mandatory for the other methods to be used), means locking down your phone, or unlocking it, is never a frustrating experience. And coming off the Xperia 1's side-mounted fingerprint reader, which was inconsistent to the point of annoyance, that was a pleasurable transition for me.In this regard Samsung is in a league of its ownTucked inside the Note 10+ is, once more, its party piece. The S Pen digital stylus with Bluetooth remains a genuinely useful accessory that delivers best-in-class note taking, annotating, illustrating, remote image taking functionality. Features like Screen Off Memo and Remote Camera Shutter are just as handy and fun to use as on last year' Galaxy Note 9+.This year, though, aside from the Pen measuring lightly smaller and coming in a fetching new colour scheme, the big new addition is Air Gestures, which use a gyroscope and accelerometer to allow you to use the S Pen like a wand to achieve various results.I can confirm that the Galaxy Note 10+ can play Scribblenauts. Yay!For example, flick the S Pen left or right and you can switch through menu screens, while rotating its tip in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction when using the camera and you can zoom in or out. Equally, flick the pen up and down and you can flip through the camera system's lenses.Air Gestures aren't a new concept, but the simple extra functionality added in here is welcome and works well and consistently, adding another string to the Note 10+'s bow. And, well, there isn't a rival device on the market that can compete with it, so in this regard Samsung is in a league of its own.Is the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ too much phone?As a tech enthusiast, there is something in the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ that just pushes all the right buttons. It absolutely smokes almost all flagship rivals in terms of internal hardware spec, punches hard across every feature area, and even delivers unique functionality with its S Pen digital stylus that other device's cannot match at all.The Note 10+ also comes in a 5G variant, so you can even get the very latest, super rapid data connections now available in most major UK cities and set to spread throughout countries over the next few years, future-proofing the device perfectly for its lifespan.All of this naturally begs the question: why wouldn't I buy the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ then?Well, cost is definitely one consideration, as while the device is a technical marvel when viewed objectively in isolation, there is no denying that a max-spec Note 10+ 5G, ringing in as it does for £1,199, is a truly eye-watering amount of money to spend that I am guessing is not very approachable in the real world to many people.Here at T3 we love top tech, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is certainly thatEven the lowest spec Galaxy Note 10+ 4G phone starts at £999 (a grand!), too, so this entire range is definitely not something to consider unless you have serious money to play with. Don't get me wrong, this is Samsung Mobile's technical leader and, as mentioned above, it is its ""no-compromise"" smartphone, so it makes sense that it is pricey, but not everyone can or should play in that ballpark.Other factors that should make you think twice before ringing up a Note 10+ are almost non-existent, but its unwieldly size, comprehensive but technically beaten in a few areas by rivals camera system, and general sense of excess (and that is the feeling of a guy who reviews a lot of very premium phones), is definitely something to muse upon before you hit the checkout. Remember, you can get almost the exact same package but in a smaller, cheaper form factor with the Galaxy Note 10.At the end of the day, though, here at T3 we love top tech, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is certainly that — it is a stunningly accomplished smartphone that will effortlessly power any user's mobile experience for years to come.",t3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-review-5G
