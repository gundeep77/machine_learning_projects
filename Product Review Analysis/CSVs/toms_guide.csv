0,Android 12,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/android-12,"• New lock screen  • A new theming system • Quick Settings visual overhaul • More compact notification shade • New Settings menu • Conversation widgets • Thicker volume and brightness sliders • More responsive notifications • New privacy dashboardAndroid 12 is proof that the phone software has come a long way in recent years. What once started off as an upstart to challenge Apple’s iOS in the dawn of the modern smartphone, Android has since grown into its own. Lately, Google has abandoned the public dessert codenames — to the chagrin of many, myself included — and focused on making Android a more mature operating system. That’s very much in evidence in Android 12.But with Android 12, Google also has taken one of the operating system’s core tenets to the extreme. Since basically the beginning, Android has been all about customization and making the phone feel like yours. Contrast this to Apple’s singular vision for iOS, which has only recently added some more personalization features in iOS 14 and iOS 15.This year, Google redesigned the whole OS from the ground up with the new Material You design language. An evolution of the Material Design we’ve seen over the last several years, this new direction takes a focus on you and molds its color palette to your wallpaper. But Android 12 isn’t all about a pretty veneer. Google has also taken a stance on privacy.Android 12 is a return to something that really drew me to the OS in the first place. For the first time in a long while, Android is fun again. I’ve spent the better part of this year running the developer previews and betas on a Pixel 5, and now that the update has officially landed, I can finally write a full review. And with the Pixel 6 now available, Android 12 has an even better chance to shine.Android 12’s highlight feature is Material You, a design language that caters itself to you. The secret is that the system now pulls out complementary colors based on your wallpaper and themes itself with them. Your Quick Settings, the Settings menu, Gboard, Messages, and many more apps get tweaked.But let’s say you don’t like the color that Android picked. You can head into the Wallpaper & Personalization section in Settings and choose from a selection of other colors that the system picked out. There’s also a predetermined selection you can opt for. Material You is the biggest facelift Android has gotten since Material Design debuted on Android 5.0 Lollipop in 2014. Seven years in the making, Material You definitively establishes an Android design scheme and, for better or for worse, it’s made itself the de facto look for the operating system. What phone makers like Samsung or OnePlus do with their Android 12 skins might differ from this new vision, but stock Android shrugs off the function-over-form mentality that we’ve seen for a very long time; we could also see that reflected in minimalist skins like Asus’ ZenUI and Motorola’s MyUX.Everything is different in Android 12, even sliders, Quick Settings toggles and the volume bar. Android 12 is all about roundness, and some might not like it. We saw the early beginnings of this switch back in Android 11. But it’s amazing how fast you adapt — even when you look back to Android 10, the blocky design already looks old and outdated. All hail the rounded corners, which even extend to the notification shade (which has a slick, smooth animation that transitions into the Quick Settings). With the Android 12 facelift came some new widgets, like new clock and weather options. All of these elements spell the core of what Material You is all about: a more personalized, accessible Android. Material You goes beyond just the theming engine, though; it is a core set of principles that define a new direction for Android and Google apps.After spending months with the new design scheme, I love Material You. Once you get the theming options figured out — notably, picking one of the preset options if you love your wallpaper and hate the colors the system suggests — it’s a wonderful experience that reminded me of why I love Android. While iOS does a lot of things right, it’s hard to make an iPhone feel like yours. Widgets and the App Library have helped, but they’re a far cry from what Android now offers.Privacy has become a big deal in recent years, and Android historically hasn’t had the best reputation in this regard. From apps constantly tracking you to the sheer amount of data that Google collects from each device, Android is a far cry from a private system.At the core of Android 12 is the Private Compute Core (PCC) and Privacy Dashboard. The latter is pretty self-explanatory and I’ll come back to it in a minute. It’s the PCC that interests me — it’s essentially a separate partition that Google uses to house the data it needs to train the AI functions like Now Playing and Enhanced auto-rotate. The information stored here never leaves your device.Private Compute Core is Google’s workaround for keeping your data private while also providing the best AI features for your Pixel. If anything, it’s long overdue and I’m glad to see it here in Android 12. But it also goes hand-in-hand with the Privacy Dashboard, which is a more user-focused addition to Android 12. Here, you can see which apps have called on various permissions — notably location, camera, and microphone. It’s basically a tell-all for what your apps are doing in the background.The Privacy settings now include individual toggles for the camera and microphone that turn those features off entirely for all apps. Until now, you'd have had to toggle the camera and microphone off for every app one at a time. You can also add camera and mic toggles to the Quick Settings to quickly enable or disable them. And finally, Android will now show an indicator in the top corner of your screen when an app is accessing the camera and/or microphone, a la iOS.What remains lacking in Android 12 is an easy way to tell apps to not track you, similar to iOS’ App Tracking Transparency initiative. Granted, you can still do something akin to that in Android. Simply head to Settings > Google > Manage your Google Account > Manage your data & privacy > Ad personalization, which you can toggle off or edit. It’s by no means as simple or straightforward as Apple’s method, though.All of the new Android 12 privacy and security features won’t compensate for bad habits. The adage of staying careful still holds true — don’t sideload apps you don’t trust and beware apps from the Play Store that ask for permissions you don’t want to grant. At least Android 12 lets you choose if you want an app to have precise or approximate location access now.Our security expert Paul Wagenseil has already broken down the new privacy and security stuff for Android 12 and the Pixel 6 (where the line between the two is a bit muddy). You can read more about the Android 12 privacy and security upgrades if you’d like.One of Android’s core strengths is notifications. Simply put, the OS handles them far better than anything Apple has ever done, thanks to Android’s intelligent grouping and easily actionable items. Even better, notifications don’t just disappear from your lockscreen when you unlock the phone — this is something that drives me absolutely insane on an iPhone.WIth Android 12, notifications have not only gotten prettier (read: rounder), but smarter as well. Apps updated for Android 12 can no longer use what’s called a notification trampoline, which is effectively a stall while the app loads. This has led to the system hanging for a brief moment while the app opens. In my experience, this has been most noticeable with Discord. But now, apps can no longer call the startActivity() intent inside a notification item. Android 12 addresses the notification trampoline delay with a cleaner, more responsive experience, sometimes with significant results.So while the new notification shade design and animations are pretty, just know that there’s a lot going on under the hood to ensure that everything gets grouped and surfaced properly and that notifications are basically immediately responsive (assuming the developer has updated the app for Android 12).With Android 12, Google finally got the memo that people play games on their phones. Stock Android has a dedicated gaming mode. Called Game Dashboard, it features some nice options, including a framerate counter, YouTube Live streaming shortcut, optimization for some games, and shortcuts for screenshots or screen recording. Whenever you’re in a game, you’ll see a little arrow from which you can access these options. I’d like to see options for Twitch and Discord, but at least Game Dashboard has some solid features from the outset. Android 12 also introduces universal device search similar to what Apple offers in iOS 15. This is different from the Google search bar widget. It allows you to search your phone for files, contacts, and apps. Third-party launchers have had things similar to this for a while, but now it’s baked into the Pixel Launcher. Word has it that this will open to third-party launchers with a new API.Universal device search is still a bit behind Spotlight on iOS 15, where you can also do web searches, find apps in the App Store, and even get results in Maps. I’d like to see Google copy this outright. Just give us a one-stop shop for searching the web, Maps, the Play Store, Drive (and open to other apps like Dropbox) and the phone itself. This is just the start and Google could really expand upon it in Android 13 and beyond.We get a lot of new, smaller features in this update, too, the most important of which I’ll briefly summarize. Android 12 now has a one-handed mode built in, letting you better use your phone with — you guessed it — one hand. Picture-in-picture windows now fit the rounded aesthetic, versus the sharp corners of the past.Google has finally addressed one of the most longstanding parts of Android, the Open With dialog box. While this has been beneficial for establishing default apps, it’s long annoyed me with links — Amazon is especially an issue. But in Android 12, Verified Links can tell your phone what app to open, based on the URL itself. It’s a small thing, but boy do I love it.Native scrolling screenshots have finally landed in Android. This lets you screenshot more than just what you can see on your screen. This is great for people who want to snag a long conversation or web page. Another feature we saw in the betas, Enhanced auto-rotate uses the front-facing camera to detect when you’re laying on your side and disable auto-rotate. This is a huge boon for people who read their phones in bed.Android 12 has a whole host of even smaller features and tweaks, so I encourage you to play around with the update on your phone to see what’s new. And if you’re not using a Pixel, expect other phone makers like Samsung and OnePlus to add their own stuff as usual.Android 12 is a big update, complete with a whole new look and focus on privacy. Google went all out to make the new version appeal to more people, especially with the Material You theming system. While the rounded aesthetic is a bit extreme in some places, I think Android is in a good spot visually.Of course, there’s always room for improvement. I want to see universal device search expand to something akin to iOS’ Spotlight. Game Dashboard could grow to include Twitch integration and a tie-in to Discord for game status — the Discord voice overlay is still possible, but it could be better for gamers. Over the next year, Google is set to drop more Android 12 features, especially for Pixels. We’re already looking toward Android 12L, which is introducing an optimized UI for foldable phones and tablets. That has led to speculation that Google is readying its own Pixel Fold.I definitely recommend updating to Android 12 when you can. It’s a worthy update and I think you’ll enjoy all of the new features."
1,Google Pixel 6,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-6,"Screen size: 6.4-inch OLED (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 90Hz CPU: Google Tensor with Titan M2 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 50MP wide (f/1.85), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2) Front camera: 8MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 4,614 mAh Size: 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches Weight: 7.3 ounces Colors: Stormy Black, Sorta Sage, Kinda CoralSay this for the Google Pixel 6 — it's a phone that refuses to be ignored.Smartphones not made by Apple and Samsung find themselves competing to capture any sort of attention. But there's no denying that the Pixel 6 is different from any Google phone that's come before it, from the distinctive new look to the Google-designed Tensor processor that now powers the company's flagship handsets. The affordable $599 price is yet another way the Pixel 6 stands out, though you'll pay more through certain carriers.So yes, the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro command your attention. Whether the phones can keep your attention, though, is the point of this Google Pixel 6 review. Much of the burden falls on the Pixel 6's Tensor chip, which not only allows the phone's camera to recognize text, but also translate it on the fly if it's in a foreign language. The new chip powers Pixel features like voice-powered typing and robocall screening, not to mention a new spate of photo processing capabilities.But having tested the Pixel 6, there's more to this phone than just Tensor. Here's a closer look at the big new features in Google's latest flagship and how it measures up to the competition.The Pixel 6 has now landed in stores, and its price depends on where you buy your phone. Get the phone unlocked or from either Google Fi, T-Mobile or Xfinity Mobile, and you'll pay $599 for the 128GB model. Upping the storage tacks another $100 onto the price.At Verizon and AT&T, you'll pay more for the Pixel 6 — $699 at Verizon and $739 at AT&T. The reason for the price discrepancy comes down to 5G. Verizon and AT&T are selling Pixel 6 models that work with their fast mmWave-based 5G networks. The lower priced Pixel 6 models only work with sub-6GHz 5G. (Even the model available through Xfinity, which uses Verizon's network for its coverage.) Check out our hub on where to buy the Pixel 6 and what you can expect to pay.Another option for buying your Pixel 6 is via Google's new subscription-based Pixel Pass. You'll pay $45 per month, but that not only gets you a phone, it also lands you subscriptions to Google One storage as well as streaming from YouTube Premium, YouTube Music Premium and Google Play Pass. Preferred care for repairs and replacements comes with Pixel Pass, too. Here's our look at whether Pixel Pass is a good deal or not.The convoluted pricing strategy is a shame, because it detracts from what's a really attractive price for a phone with the kind of features we'll explore in depth in a moment. The Pixel 6 is a big improvement over last year's Pixel 5, but at many places, the new phone costs less than its predecessor. Even at Verizon, you're paying the same price for the Pixel 6 that you would have for the Pixel 5, and getting a much better phone in return.We're rounding up the best Pixel 6 deals to help you find the lowest price on Google's new phone.If Google were to hold a Pixel reunion inviting every previous model, the Pixel 6 would surely stand out from the crowd. It looks like no other Google flagship before it.The distinctive new look stems entirely from the horizontal camera bar that stretches across the back of the phone. That's quite a different approach from other camera arrays, which are generally confined to the upper left corner of a device. A happy side effect is that even though the horizontal bar sticks out from the Pixel 6's back, it prevents any wobbling when you set the phone down on its back.On the front of the Pixel 6, you get a cutout for the 8MP selfie cam in the center of the 6.4-inch display and a fingerprint sensor underneath the glass panel on the bottom. You'll have to really press and hold your finger against the sensor for it to work — a simple touch won't do it — but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly responsive.The Pixel 6 has an IP68 water resistance rating and Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus for better scratch resistance. I'd still make sure to track down a Pixel 6 case, and Google offers a $29 option that uses 30% recycled materials and is built to absorb shocks.At 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches, the Pixel 6 is bigger and thicker than the iPhone 13 and Samsung Galaxy S21. But the Pixel 6 has a larger 6.4-inch display. However, the OnePlus 9, which has a bigger screen than the Pixel 6, boasts a smaller form factor. At 7.3 ounces, the Pixel 6 is pretty hefty, too; the OnePlus 9 weighs in at 6.77 ounces.Think of the Pixel 6 as sporting the Goldilocks of phone displays — at 6.4 inches, it's not too big nor too small, but likely just right for most users. The 2400 x 1080p resolution is very sharp, and the minimal bezels mean that apps will fill up the available screen space.If you want a phone whose display maxes out at a refresh rate of 120Hz, you'll need to pony up for the Pixel 6 Pro, but Google hasn't left owners of the less expensive option high and dry. The Pixel 6 offers an adaptive 90Hz refresh rate, scaling up when your on-screen activity would benefit from smoother scrolling and gameplay and dropping back down to 60Hz at other times to preserve battery.Colors are fairly consistent on the Pixel 6's display when compared to similarly priced phones that use AMOLED panels. With its display set to Natural, the Pixel 6 shows off 100.9% of the sRGB color spectrum, which is slightly less than the iPhone 13 (110.2%), Galaxy S21 (109.2%) and the OnePlus 9 (104.1%). Based on Delta-E scores, the Pixel 6 with its 0.28 score is slightly less accurate than the iPhone 13 (0.26) and OnePlus 9 (0.27) in terms of color reproduction.Watching Cruella stream on Disney Plus with the brightness cranked all the way up, I thought colors looked a little muted on the Pixel 6 screen, though the brighter tones were certainly bright enough. Emma Stone's transformation into Cruella was highlighted by a bright red dress that stood out amid a more subdued sea of black and white clothing.Still, the Pixel 6 certainly isn't hurting for brightness. With the Adaptive Display feature enabled, we measured the Pixel 6's screen at 843 nits of brightness. That's brighter than the most comparable phones from Apple, Samsung and OnePlus.While the Google Pixel 6 Pro adds a fancy telephoto lens to its rear camera array, the Pixel 6 sticks with the traditional wide angle/ultrawide angle setup. But don't weep for the Pixel 6 — that main wide angle lens is getting a boost to 50MP, a big leap from the 12.2MP sensors Google has used on past flagships.In addition, the cameras on the Pixel 6 come equipped with Google's usual array of tricks powered by computation photography. This year's batch of tools include the ability to easily erase people and objects cluttering up the background of your photos, turn static shots into action photos with artistic blurs, software smarts that remove the blur from faces and improvements to how the cameras capture skin tone, particularly for people of color.I put the Pixel 6's cameras up against the iPhone 13's, because Apple's latest phone has the same kind of camera array — a main lens and an ultrawide — and it also ranks as one of the best camera phones available. You can see why in this shot of a statue down by the marina near my house. The iPhone 13 really nails the colors in this scene, from the pink suspenders on the statue to the red head of the carved vulture; the blue-and-yellow houseboat in the background really pops, too. The Pixel 6's shot is all right, but colors feel more muted. Perhaps it was the rainy, overcast day, but the Pixel 6 opted for accuracy in its colors, and the result is a less vibrant shot.Indoors, it's the same comparison. The Pixel 6 has gone cooler with its photo of this taco plate, while the iPhone 13 ramps up the color, as you can see by the pickled carrot slice and lime wedge in the foreground. It's really striking how the two phones handled that apple in the upper right corner of the picture — in the iPhone's rendition, it's sharp and bright green, while the Pixel renders it dull and a little bit blurry. Perhaps the light streaming in from the background tripped the Pixel 6 up, but the iPhone shot is clearly better.Back at the marina, the Pixel 6's approach to color finally pays off as the phone keeps the rainclouds over the Oakland skyline looking gray and foreboding, instead of giving them the blueish hue seen in the iPhone's shot. Things are a little sharper in the iPhone 13 photo, as you can read the Dulcinea name of the boat on the right side of the shot, but that Pixel 6 competes well here.The Pixel 6 may lack a telephoto lens, but its Super Res Zoom feature is able to assist any digital zooms up to 7x to keep the shot clear and focused. I only cranked things up to 4x, and was pleased by how the camera captured the Oakland skyline from across the San Leandro channel. Buildings remain in focus, particularly the Tribune Tower I zoomed in on, and there's minimal noise within the shot. The iPhone 13 didn't fare nearly so well with a 4x zoom, as the shot darkened considerably and the buildings tended to blend together.Both phones did well at night, with their respective night modes able to cleanly capture some Halloween decorations perched in an orange tree. The Pixel 6's Night Sight has the more realistic shot, with a cooler color cast that retains the shadows on the skull. The iPhone 13 brightens the orange tree leaves in a pleasing way, and it manages to bring out the white of the skull. But if you look closely, the skull loses some focus in the iPhone 13's Night mode. I think the Pixel 6 does the better job here.The portrait shot of my daughter is a tale of two color temperatures — the Pixel 6 skews cold while the iPhone 13 favors a warm cast. I think the iPhone 13 made the better decision, not just because it's a shot that looks more autumnal, but also because my daughter's striped shirt looks white where it should be and doesn't have the blue tint that the Pixel 6 has added. Neither phone offers a particularly convincing blur in this shot, perhaps because my daughter is standing too far back into the persimmon tree, confounding both phones' computational photography.Pictures taken with the front camera are more evenly matched, though again, the Pixel 6 really likes cool colors. It's a good effort even if it washes out some of the wrinkles in my face, but I think the iPhone 13 shot is more realistic, particularly the way it captures the different colors of my hair, including the graying patches up top. Old age comes for us all, friends.The Pixel 6 camera experience is about more than lenses, though, as Google puts its computational photography prowess to work with new photo editing skills that give you the chance to improve and enhance your photos. The features added to the Pixel 6's photo toolbox are easy to use, when they even require your intervention at all.Magic Eraser is probably going to be the most widely embraced feature, as most of us have probably taken what seems like a perfect shot, only to find it cluttered up by people and objects in the background. Magic Eraser, available in the editing tools in Photo will automatically select people and objects to remove, which you can do with a tap.Remember that Pixel 6 selfie I took up above? It has a person in the background over my left shoulder. But Magic Eraser can identify that person, along with anything else cluttering up the shot and offer to remove them automatically. You can also tap other areas to remove objects — or in the case of that No Time to Die movie poster over my right shoulder, tell Magic Eraser to leave Daniel Craig be.Motion is a new mode on the Pixel 6's camera that takes flat, static images and livens them up with blurs to denote movement. It's particularly useful for livening up action shots and can even improve otherwise dull photos of cars passing by a movie theater. Shot with the Motion mode enabled, the Pixel 6 added background blurs and other effects while keeping the SUV in focus. The result turns a leisurely downtown drive into an exciting chase scene.You can select Action Pan which focuses on the moving object, like my car photo up above. There's also long exposure, in which the moving objects get the blur treatment.There are other software improvements in the Pixel 6, too, including a feature that unblurs the face of anyone who moved just as you were taking the shot and the ability to process HDRnet in 4K videos for more vibrant colors. Speaking of color, Google has been working with image experts to improve how skin tones appear in photos shot by its cameras, and the result should be more accurate representation of people of color in your photos.Much of the focus around the Pixel 6 release has been on Tensor, the Google-built system-on-chip that powers many of the machine learning capabilities that highlight the new phones. It's Tensor, for example, that's helping power some of those photo-enhancing capabilities we just discussed. But silicon also drives performance, and one of the big questions surrounding Tensor has been how it will compare to the Snapdragon 888 chipset that powers the leading Android devices.The answer is that Tensor's in the same ballpark as the Snapdragon 888, even if it's sitting a few sections back. On Geekbench 5, the Pixel 6 posted single and multicore scores of 1,029 and 2,696, respectively. Both numbers were behind what we've seen from leading Snapdragon 888 devices like the Galaxy S21 (1,048 and 3,302) and the OnePlus 9 (1,126 and 3,618). With the iPhone 13 and its A15 Bionic chip outpacing Snapdragon 888 phones on this test, the Tensor proves no match either.When it comes to graphics, the Tensor's performance is more in line with other top Android flagships. In 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited test, the Pixel 6, OnePlus 9 and and Galaxy S21 all turned in frames around 34 frames per second. The iPhon 13, meanwhile, produced a 55.9 FPS score.The Pixel 6 can take comfort in how it performed in a real-world test where we use Adobe Premiere Rush to transcode 4K video into 1080p. While the Galaxy S21 and the OnePlus 9 both took a little more than 1 minute to complete the task, the Pixel 6 finished the job in 49 seconds. It's not the 26-second result the iPhone 13 produced, but it's one of the better times we've seen from an Android phone. To see how the Pixel 6 compares to the competition, check out our Google Pixel 6 benchmark overview, complete with charts and analysis. The bottom line is that Tensor is better than you think. Playing a graphically demanding game like PUBG Mobile on the Pixel 6, graphics looked sharp and response times were good, even if my aim wasn't. I was also impressed by the Pixel's speakers located at the top and bottom of the phone. Oftentimes, phones that use that setup run the risk of having your hands cover the speakers when holding the phone in landscape mode, but the sound of gunfire came through loud and clear on the Pixel 6.The Tensor chipset includes a 5G modem — reportedly one of Samsung's Exynos 5123 modems. That's a step or two behind the Qualcomm Snapdragon X60 modem found in current flagships such as the iPhone 13 and Galaxy S21. As a result, you'd expect 5G speeds to be a little slower on the Pixel 6.My testing showed signs of that. With my review unit loaded up with a Verizon SIM card, I recorded average download speeds of 35.3 Mbps on Verizon's nationwide 5G. (That's not the Ultra Wideband network Verizon's got in more than 80 cities around the US where speeds can approach 1 Gbps.) I popped that same SIM card into an iPhone 13 and recorded an average speed of 35.8 Mbps. No, that's not a big gap, but the iPhone speeds were consistently in that range, whereas the Pixel's 5G performance was all over the map.In the end, it's probably not a dealbreaker for most users, but throw in the fact that Pixel models have different models based on the type of 5G network they can connect with, and it creates some unnecessary confusion about the kind of performance you can expect.You want confusing performance, though, check out our battery test results we got from the Pixel 6 and its 4,614 mAh battery. Our test involves setting a phone to surf the web continuously over a cellular connection — ideally 5G — and then timing how long it takes for the fully-charged device to run out of power. For consistency, we set each phone's screen to 150 nits of brightness, which requires the Pixel 6 to be set at a very demanding 77%.That's a long way of saying that the Pixel's numbers when testing over 5G are not very impressive. With its 90Hz refresh rate enabled, the Pixel 6 lasted for 8 hours and 13 minutes on T-Mobile's 5G network — That's nearly two hours shy of the average for smartphones. However, I ran that same test on my house using a Verizon SIM, where I can only pick up an LTE signal. Without the power demands of 5G, the Pixel 6 lasted longer — an average of 10 hours and 52 minutes across multiple tests. Now that's more like it.To see how the Pixel 6 fares versus other flagship phones, check out our Pixel 6 battery life results overview, which includes runtimes for the iPhone 13 series and Galaxy S21. Our guess is that our battery test burdens the older 5G modem in the Pixel 6, as its subpar performance was in line with 5G phones we saw in early 2020. In real world usage over a mix of 5G, LTE and Wi-Fi, the Pixel 6's battery held up pretty well — not enough to challenge devices with the best phone battery life, but enough so that you won't need to seek out a mid-day recharge. Using a fully charged Pixel 6, I spent an afternoon taking pictures and running some other tests before leaving the handset unplugged overnight. The next morning, I still had a 71% charge remaining.To get more life out of the Google phone, check out our guide on how to disable 5G on Pixel 6. When it is time to recharge the Pixel 6, Google's device now supports 30W wired charging, a jump from the Pixel 5's 18W speed. That's the good news — the bad news is that Google doesn't include a 30W charger so you'll have to spring for one on your own. We had a 30W charger in our lab, and after 30 minutes of charging a drained Pixel 6, the phone's battery readout was back to 29%. The Galaxy S21 gets to 55% in that time, and the OnePlus 9, with its insane 65W charger, comes close to a full recharge.The Pixel 6 introduces the world to Android 12, Google's latest software update for Android phones. This is no mere tweak, as Android 12 introduces us to Google's new Material You interface that's baked right into the Pixel 6. That means the wallpapers adapt to the color of your Pixel — the available wallpapers all adjusted to complement my Kinda Coral review unit. You also get themed icons for the built-in Google apps, and even elements like the keyboard take on the shading of your phone.In some cases, it's a bit much. I don't know if I'll grow to appreciate the coral-themed keys on the Pixel 6's on-screen keyboard over time or if I'll continue to think of a bottle of Pepto-Bismol when it's time to tap out an email. But it at least shows some consistency as Google takes a page out of Apple's playbook and more closely integrates its software with its hardware.Google Assistant is smarter than ever, and some of the new features really have the potential to come in handy. You can now send text messages by dictating them through the assistant, and it's shockingly accurate, as the assistant can even insert punctuation without making it sound like you're sending an old-timey telegram. It's smart enough to know by the sound of your voice where to insert periods and question marks, and it can even recognize commands like Clear and Send. You do have to repeat ""Hey Google, type"" for each message, but a handy visual cue — the microphone icon lights up with a rainbow band — lets you know when the assistant is listening for dictation.Google is also taking its first tentative steps away from beginning every assistant request with ""Hey Google."" On the Pixel 6, you can stop an alarm simply by saying ""stop"" or ""snooze."" Similarly, you can say ""answer"" or ""decline"" when there's an incoming call. It's not an extensive list at this point, but I imagine Google is working on other voice commands where no ""Hey Google"" will be required.Past Pixel releases have introduced features to the phone app like Hold for Me, where you can task the assistant with handling interminable waits on hold and notifying you when a live person is finally on the line. That feature's back with the Pixel 6, and it brought some friends. Type in a phone number into the Pixel 6's dialer, and you'll see a chart with wait time patterns, giving you a sense of when might be a better time to call. You can also adjust the Phone app's settings to provide real-time transcriptions of automated phone messages, including menu options — the numbered buttons even appear at the bottom of the screen for easy tapping. These features only work with toll-free business numbers at this time. We have a full look at the new Wait Times and Direct My Call features Google added to the Pixel 6.The excellent Recorder app now can record and transcribe German and Japanese. And speaking of transcription capabilities, a new Live Translate feature can recognize different languages in messages, media and pictures and convert them to English for you. The most valuable implementation is an interpreter feature that lets the Google Assistant listen to and translate spoken text — it will handle German and Japanese on the Pixel 6 itself, and you can access 48 other languages if you have an online connection. The interpreter feature probably works best when you're traveling overseas and talking to native language speakers — I tried the feature with my wife who speaks a little German, and while it generally worked, I think her accent and pronunciation baffled the assistant at times.That's a lot of new features to digest, and Google doesn't always make it easy to find them, forcing you to dig into settings to enable them. But I'm glad Google continues to put its machine learning features to use in practical ways.Apple has made some hay by emphasizing the privacy features of its phones in recent years, and it's clear Google is tired of letting Cupertino claim all the glory here. The Pixel 6, aided by its Tensor chipset and dedicated Titan M2 secure enclave aim to keep your data safe and sound.My colleague Paul Wagenseil goes into greater detail on the Pixel 6's security and privacy features, but the highlights include a new Privacy dashboard that gives you a history of which apps are using the Pixel 6's location, camera and microphone; you can also add a camera/microphone toggle to the quick settings to easily turn access on and off. A security hub gives you a one-stop destination to manage your passwords, app permissions and Google account. Because of the switch to the Tensor chip, Google says it can now commit to five years of security updates for the Pixel 6. That's not the same thing as Android software updates, where it sounds like you're still going to get three, but it's a step toward providing the kind of lengthy support that Apple gives its iPhones, meaning you'll be able to hold onto this device longer.The Pixel 6 is the best phone Google's ever made. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily ready to supplant flagships from Apple and Samsung among the best phones you can buy.The cameras on the Pixel 6 are as good as ever, and the new editing tools bring some welcome features. That said, I think the iPhone 13 takes better pictures for the most part, particularly in low lighting, where past Pixels have previously excelled. Tensor seems like a welcome addition to the Pixel lineup as well, though the true value of its machine learning expertise is only going to fully reveal itself over time.I wish battery performance was more consistent on the Pixel 6 and that figuring out 5G connectivity didn't require a wall chart. Since Google can now commit to security updates for longer periods of time, it would do well to mirror Apple's stance on software updates, too.Between the new capabilities introduced by both Tensor and Android 12, though, the Pixel 6 is definitely a contender to become your next phone. Android fans who want the best out of Google's software would do well to consider an upgrade to the latest Pixel."

With upgraded cameras, a big 120Hz dynamic display, and the all-new Tensor chip, this is a phone that means business. Better yet, it starts at just $899, below other flagship phones that cost $1,000 or more.Tensor is especially exciting, since it offers huge possibilities for computational photography, on-device speech recognition and translation, and other nifty features. But the Pixel 6 Pro struggles with battery life in our testing, clocking in well below other flagship handsets, despite its large 5,000 mAh power pack. If you don’t need a 120Hz display or telephoto zoom, be sure to check out our Google Pixel 6 review. The smaller phone is more affordable with a starting price of $599, but it still has the same Tensor chip and upgraded main camera sensor.But if you prefer a larger display and want one of the best phones for the money period, the Pixel 6 Pro is a winner. As you’ll see in this full Pixel 6 Pro review, this flagship deserves to be considered right alongside the best from Apple and Samsung. Google has kept the Pixel 6 Pro's cost below those of fellow flagship handsets. Starting at $899 for the 128GB model, the Pixel 6 Pro packs in a lot of hardware value on top of Google's excellent software design and support.Announced October 19, the Pixel 6 Pro are available as of October 28. You can grab yours from the Google Store or Google Fi, plus AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Xfinity Mobile. Beware that some of the carrier prices come out higher than Google's MSRP, which appears to be related to 5G capabilities (some Pixel 6 SKUs don't have mmWave 5G, for example). With the Pixel 6 Pro comes the optional Pixel Pass, which starts at $45 per month. This all-in-one program gives you a Pixel upgrade every two years, device protection, a 200GB Google One cloud subscription, YouTube Premium (including YouTube Music Premium), and Google Play Pass. On paper, it's quite the deal.Check out the best Google Pixel 6 deals right now to get the best discounts. The phones are proving to be very difficult to get a hold due to high demand, but we have a breakdown on where to buy the Pixel 6 Pro.The biggest thing about the Pixel 6 Pro at first glance is the fresh, new design. Gone is the spartan, function-over-form Pixel language that we’ve had since 2016. The Pixel 6 Pro is a beautiful device with a curved display, a glass back with three nice color options, and the camera bar that spans the width of the phone.I’m of two minds about the camera bar. On the one hand, I like seeing Google try something new and unique in a sea of glass and metal slabs. On the other, I think it makes the Pixel 6 Pro look rather strange, for a lack of a better word. It feels awkward to me, especially since the whole thing juts out from the phone.Overall, I really like the Pixel 6 Pro’s feel and build quality. It’s solid and has a nice heft without being too heavy. The phone is overall narrower than the iPhone 13 Pro Max I’ve been using. While the 6.7-inch display is still too big to use one-handed, I think the Pixel 6 Pro is more comfortable to hold than Apple’s latest large phone. The curved back helps, too, versus Apple’s squared off edges.One thing I dislike about the hardware is the fingerprint sensor, and my colleague Roland Moore-Coyler agrees with me. No longer located on the back of the phone (which is where I prefer it to be), the Pixel 6 Pro sports an in-display fingerprint reader. Like the Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9 Pro, it’s fine, but I’ve noticed that it’s slower than the competition and it’s very picky about where you place your finger. Whereas I think the OnePlus 9 Pro or Galaxy S21 are more forgiving, the Pixel 6 Pro seems to have a smaller reader area.The Pixel 6 Pro’s display holds well against others for color saturation and color accuracy, but it falls behind on brightness. It features a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate, meaning it can go all the way down to 10Hz to save on battery, but ramp up to 120Hz for content where it makes sense.Here’s how the Pixel 6 Pro compares to its Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro Max rivals.As you can see, the Pixel 6 Pro holds up very well in comparison to the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Galaxy S21 Ultra, even getting brighter than the latter. All three phones are pretty equal when it comes to color saturation, even if the iPhone 13 Pro Max has quite a lead on the Delta-E color accuracy score (where 0 is perfect).Where I think the Pixel 6 Pro’s display falters a bit is on brightness. While it can get decently bright outside, it’s not nearly as visible as the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s ludicrously bright screen. Inside, the iPhone once again inches ahead with a higher peak brightness with adaptive brightness disabled. The Pixel 6 Pro doesn’t struggle outdoors as much as previous Pixels have, but it’s still a ways off from the iPhone 13 Pro Max.In practice, the display is excellent for playing games like Genshin Impact or the grim Back 4 Blood or The Ascent on Xbox Game Pass. Watching movies and videos is also a great experience, with enough saturation to make scenes like the harsh orange tones in Blade Runner 2049 absolutely pop. This is certainly the best display I’ve ever seen on a Pixel. Even though the Pixel 5’s or Pixel 5a’s screens weren’t bad, the Pixel 6 Pro is certainly leaps and bounds better.Now we’ve come to the thing that defines a Pixel: the cameras. Google pioneered what was possible with computational photography and although other phone makers have since caught up, Pixels regularly feature on our list of the best camera phones. This year, the Pixel 6 Pro ups the ante.Google upgraded the hardware to complement the improved software algorithms and Tensor strengths. The main sensor is now 50MP, letting in 150% more light according to Google. The 12MP ultrawide camera has a 114-degree field of view and the 48MP telephoto sports a 4x optical zoom thanks to its folded optics. Overall, the Pixel 6 Pro can go up to a 20x digital zoom, with the AI-powered Super Res Zoom to help clean up the final images.Among the new AI features powered by the Tensor chip, the highlight is Magic Eraser. This is an incredible feat of engineering, letting you effectively remove unwanted items from the background of your photos. It's obviously not perfect, but the Pixel 6 Pro will automatically suggest things to remove. Google says it works best on beaches and at parks.Without further ado, here’s how the Pixel 6 Pro stacks up to the likes of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the current king of our best camera phones list.In this photo of the pumpkins, the differences between the two photos is slight, but you can see that the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s picture looks a tad more saturated. You can see this in the scarecrow’s shirt and background in those blues and reds, plus the red building in the back. The Pixel 6 Pro’s image almost looks washed out in comparison, but this comes down to differences in post-processing. I personally prefer the iPhone’s picture here.Heading indoors to this produce stand, the Pixel’s shot is brighter and compensates better for the harsh lighting above. The iPhone warmed things up a bit too much in response to the cool lighting, and the image is overall dimmer than the Pixel’s. I think Google’s phone wins here.In this ultrawide landscape shot, the Pixel has a clear advantage when it comes to brightness. The scene looks more well-lit thanks to the sun off to the left. That said, the iPhone captures more of the landscape due to its wider field of view. The greenish tones to the water look a bit better in the Pixel’s image, but this is, as we’ve seen thus far, a very close race.In these portraits of Mark Spoonauer, both phones took different approaches to the final images. The Pixel zoomed out a bit while the iPhone brought things in a little closer to focus on Mark’s face. Both phones had to compensate for the direct sunlight on the subject and both did very well, even if the Pixel compensated better in my opinion. The blur radii are very artistic, too. I think either portrait is great, but I prefer the color tones in the Pixel’s image.This comparison between the two phones’ night modes certainly surprised me. Right away, the Pixel’s picture using Night Sight is brighter. The plant on the left is fully visible, as are the pumpkins and flowers in the foreground. The shadows remain deep, but they don’t overpower anything else in the photo, unlike the iPhone’s shot. That one is very dark, with the pink flowers on the left almost invisible.The two selfies are quite different. The Pixel’s image has softer colors, but sharp focus on my face. It does make my hair look a bit darker than it actually is. Meanwhile, the iPhone’s selfie is brighter, but my face looks a bit too smooth. The colors look off, though, with an overall yellow-green tinge to the final image — the Pixel’s colors are more natural.For zoom comparisons, we brought out the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Samsung went all out with zoom this year on its best phone. It can go all up the way up to 100x and features Zoom Lock, which uses AI to help keep your photos steady. The Pixel 6 Pro tops out at 20x, but sports Super Res Zoom. I decided to compare the Pixel’s 20x to the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s 20x.Despite the blurred out license plate in the S21 Ultra’s photo, both images look similar until you really look at the background. The Pixel’s picture is a bit cleaner, while Samsung’s seems a tad blurry on that purple SUV. But all of the signage in either image is clearly legible, including the chimney sweep and Help Wanted ones. Again, I think the Pixel’s image is cleaner than the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s, but it’s a very close race. Samsung obviously has the clear advantage when it comes to max zoom, however.Motion Mode, which includes Action Pan and Long Exposure, is great for those long exposure shots to create artistic photos that perfectly express movement. Action Pan focuses on a moving subject and blurs the background, while Long Exposure adds blur to moving objects within the scene. You can see the former above, with Action Pan on and off as this blue SUV drives by.Similarly, here’s Long Exposure on and off. It’s a pretty cool and artistic effect, as you can see in this photo of a running fountain.Finally, I included a sample from the Pixel 6 Pro’s astrophotography mode, grabbing a picture of the beautiful moon, and the ultrawide selfie cam. Both examples are in the gallery above. Video has also seen a boost thanks to Tensor. You can record HDR live in 4K, offering vivid and punchy videos — 4K video is also available on the front-facing camera. Selfie recordings get sound improvements, too, with Speech Enhancement. Google says the Pixel 6 Pro will better filter out background noise to make your voice come through clearly.Pixels have always taken excellent photos, but have historically struggled with video. That’s changed this year, though I’m not sure it’s as good as the iPhone 13 Pro Max. There’s certainly no Cinematic mode on the Pixel 6 Pro, but that isn’t really a bad thing. We knew the Pixel 6 Pro’s cameras would be good, but driving that excellence is Tensor, Google Silicon’s first-generation chip. It’s built for AI and machine learning (ML) and you can see that evident in the computational photography. But it also lends itself to on-device speech recognition and translation and other AI-powered features like Live Transcribe and Live Translate.Google flat out said that benchmarks alone don’t tell Tensor’s whole story, but we nonetheless have to look to them to draw comparisons to other devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Here’s how the Pixel 6 Pro, with its 12GB of RAM, stacks up to its competition.Overall, for a first-generation product, Tensor doesn’t do too bad. Apple’s A15 Bionic is still clearly superior and Google Silicon has a long way to go to catch up. But in most of the above tests, Tensor holds its own against the Snapdragon 888 (and its Adreno 660 GPU) in the Galaxy S21 Ultra.Of course, you can see that Tensor performed the Adobe Premiere Rush test — where a phone transcodes a 4K video to 1080p — faster than the Galaxy S21 Ultra. It’s still slower than the iPhone 13 Pro Max, but it’s certainly one of the best Android phones in this particular test. And surprisingly enough, the Pixel 6 Pro outperformed the Galaxy S21 Ultra in the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited gaming benchmark, netting six more frames per second than Samsung’s phone.We started running the Geekbench ML TensorFlow Lite tests after the S21 Ultra came out, but Tensor is pretty neck and neck with other Snapdragon 888 devices that have gone through those tests. For a chip designed specifically for AI/ML, I expected to see Tensor step really far ahead of the Snapdragon 888 or keep up with the A15 Bionic. That said, no one expected this first go to be perfect.As for 5G, the Pixel 6 Pro uses an older Samsung 5123 modem. This piece of hardware is more equivalent to the Qualcomm X55 modem from 2020 that we saw in the Galaxy S20 and iPhone 12 models. Granted, few US carriers take full advantage of the new X60 modem, but there are efficiency gains over the X55 and Samsung 5123. In practice, this leads to 5G on the Pixel 6 Pro (and the Pixel 6) draining more battery than it probably ought to.To see how the Pixel 6 Pro stacks up with other phones, see our dedicated Pixel 6 benchmarks page. The Pixel 6 Pro packs the biggest battery we’ve ever seen in a Pixel, clocking in at a huge 5,000 mAh. That’s the same size as the Galaxy S21 Ultra and 500 mAh bigger than the OnePlus 9 Pro. We don’t know the exact size of the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s battery in milliamp-hours, but you can’t draw direct comparisons between Android and iPhone batteries anyway.We do know that all of the three above-mentioned phones last longer than 10 hours in the Tom’s Guide battery life test. This is where we set a phone to 150 nits of brightness and task it to endlessly reload web pages on a cellular connection until it kicks the bucket. Here’s how the Pixel 6 Pro fared against the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Galaxy S21 Ultra. I am, in a word, flabbergasted. The Pixel 6 Pro’s incredibly poor battery life result gives me significant pause. A phone with a 5,000 mAh battery should not provide something this bad. Even considering that Tensor is a first-generation product (with an older 5G modem), I expected far, far better.To see how the Pixel 6 Pro compares with other flagship phones on endurance, see our Pixel 6 battery life results page. Anecdotally, I don’t think the Pixel 6 Pro’s battery life is that bad. I took the phone out to the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. for a full day of photography and navigating public transit, then spent the evening getting product photos and playing some Xbox Game Pass at 100% brightness. I ended the day in the 35% battery range, which isn’t awful considering how hard I pushed the phone. In the time since, I've regularly finished the day with more than enough life left to keep the battery anxiety away.The Pixel 6 Pro finally got a charging speed upgrade over previous Pixels. Before, Google limited things to 18W, which was just way too slow. Even Apple and Samsung got faster than that, though not by much at 20W and 25W, respectively. But the Pixel 6 Pro charges at 30W over a cable, 23W with the new Pixel Stand, and 12W with a standard Qi charger. Unfortunately, Google does not provide a charger with the Pixel 6 Pro.The Pixel 6 Pro debuts with Android 12, which arrived for other supported Pixels on October 19. Although you get the same OS-level features on any Pixel from the Pixel 3/3 XL and above, the Pixel 6 Pro is where Android 12 shines, especially with the new Material You design language and theming system. Rumors leading up to the Pixel 6 Pro suggested that we’d see longer support with the Pixel 6 series. While that’s true in some respect — the phone will receive five years of security patches — Google has only committed to three years of Android updates at time of writing. Considering that the company now owns the silicon powering the Pixel 6 Pro, I find this to be in really bad taste. I expected platform updates rivaling that of Apple. A full Android 12 review is outside the scope of this Pixel 6 Pro review. However, there are several Pixel 6-specific features that Google highlighted in its keynote. The company is touting the security and privacy aspects of the Pixel 6 Pro, with many of those powered by Tensor and its security core, which includes the new Titan M2 security chip. Google Assistant is getting a lot smarter and more helpful with the Pixel 6 Pro. For instance, when you're voice typing, you can insert emojis using your voice and issue commands like ""Clear,"" ""Stop,"" and ""Send."" I’ve never been big on voice texting, but the accuracy and convenience on the Pixel 6 Pro is unmatched right now. You might even consider me a convert.The Live Translate feature lets you just point the camera at a sign in a foreign language and see it translated. Or you can tell Assistant to be your interpreter and it will translate what's said in real time. Google showed this off in an interview with Marie Kondo.Google continues to lead the way on making phone calls more convenient. Not only is Call Screen still here — where you can make callers announce themselves before you pick up the phone — but you can now get wait time estimates and call menu transcriptions for those pesky options when you dial a business. Assistant is the perfect phone call companion now.Google Assistant on the Pixel 6 Pro also supports new quick phrases for things like ""Stop"" for an alarm or timer and ""Decline"" when getting incoming calls. And At a Glance can show you things on the home screen when you need it, such as your plane ticket, appointments, commute times and more.With an incredible camera array and the promise that Tensor provides, the Pixel 6 Pro is certainly a good choice for Android enthusiasts. It has enough power for any task and it is a wonderful camera phone. The best part is the price. At $899, the Pixel 6 Pro is more affordable than the iPhone 13 Pro Max and Galaxy S21 Ultra and just as capable in most areas.In fact, the Pixel 6 Pro is compelling enough to convince me to switch back to Android from the iPhone 13 Pro Max I’ve been using. I like the curved display, I love the cameras, and all of the convenient Pixel features that I’ve come to adore over the years have gotten even better — Call Screen alone is enough for me to recommend a Pixel to anyone.From my own experience with the phone, I can easily recommend the Pixel 6 Pro to anyone who’s looking for the best Android camera experience. Platform-agnostics may still want to look at the iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max, both of which are more powerful than the Pixel 6 Pro. But when push comes to shove, Google’s new top-tier phone offers everything you could want in a handset without breaking the bank."
3,Honor 50,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/honor-50,"Starting price: £449 Display: 6.57-inch OLED, FHD (1080 x 2340) Refresh rate: 120Hz Rear cameras: 108MP main (f/1.9), 8MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 2MP macro (f/2.4), 2MP depth (f/2.4) Front camera: 32MP (f/2.2) Chipset: Snapdragon 778G RAM: 6GB/8GB Storage: 128GB/256GB Battery: 4,300 mAh Charging: 66W wired Operating system: Android 11 with Magic UI 4 Size: 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches (160 x 73.8 x 7.8 mm) Weight: 6.17 oz (175 g)After taking a year off from selling phones in Europe, Honor is back with the plainly-named Honor 50. Because Honor can once again use Google Mobile Services, you can use all the Android apps that you're used to having on hand, making this a much easier sell for the average phone buyer.Somewhat surprisingly for a phone marking the brand's revival, the Honor 50 isn't a flagship, but a midrange device. That hasn't stopped Honor offering a surprisingly luxurious screen or a decent (albeit unreliable) camera package, which is good news given how competitive this part of the market can be. The OnePlus Nord 2 remains the better all-round phone in this price range, particularly given the Honor 50 is probably a bit too expensive at its current price for what it offers. Don't let that stop you if you love both watching and taking smartphone video though, as this is where this phone shines brightest.The Honor 50 goes on sale today (Oct. 27), and can be currently be found on Honor's websiteor at Currys PC World. There won't be any U.S. availability, which is in line with Honor's behaviour even before its divorce from Huawei.The price of the Honor 50 begins at £449 for 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, with a £529 8GB RAM/256GB storage option also available. Given that the OnePlus Nord 2 starts at £399 for 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, and offers 12GB RAM/256GB storage for £469, the Honor 50 on its face look like a bad deal.Photography and videography are the dual cores of Honor's pitch with the 50 series. The phone sports a 108MP main sensor, an 8MP ultrawide camera and then 2MP macro and 2MP depth sensors rounding off the back camera array. Honor embeds those lenses into two circular camera bumps. The Honor 50’s front camera uses a 32MP sensor.I compared the Honor 50's skills in producing still images to the OnePlus Nord 2, currently the best mid-range phone available in the U.K. and Honor's biggest rival in this price bracket. This shot of the London Underground sign hung above Tuffnel Park station proved tricky for the Honor. It took several tries to get a shot that balanced the bright autumn sky against the lit-up sign, but the final result was an image with warm, saturated color. The Nord 2's photos were more consistent, but the image is colder and a bit drab.I faced a different struggle with the Honor's cameras when I returned later to the same spot after night had fallen. Smudges of light from other sources within the camera's view kept spoiling the clear sky, although I was at least able to get a shot of the sign with much more consistency than I had earlier in the day. The Nord 2 again proved more consistent, but the image is again not quite as appealing and rich as the one I finally coaxed from the Honor 50.I noticed the Honor 50's issue with image consistency again when taking this indoor close-up of one of my housemate's decorate espresso cups. Even selecting the brightest shot captured by the Honor 50, the Nord 2's image is far brighter. It seems that without strong light sources around, the Honor 50 starts to lose its advantage.For the final comparison, I took portrait selfies with both phones. I really don't like the coloring of the Honor 50's shot — it’s richer than the Nord 2's image, but it gives my skin an unpleasant yellow tinge. I prefer the Nord 2's bokeh mode too. It offers a slider to control the intensity of the effect, unlike the Honor, and does a better job of capturing all the pinpricks of light coming through the gaps in the leaves behind me.On the video front, Honor adds some special features in the form of automatic dual-view and picture-in-picture recording, allowing the use of two cameras at once without any post-production work. This is clearly part of Honor's attempt to pursue the TikTok and vlog-obsessed youth, but if you've got the creativity to make use of this feature, it feels like a worthwhile inclusion to the Honor 50.The Honor 50 features a 6.5-inch OLED FHD 120Hz screen, with the selfie camera embedded in a central punch-hole notch. Unusually for a phone at this price, Honor has given the 50 a dramatically curved display. You typically only find curved displays like this on expensive flagships like the OnePlus 9 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. This feature gives the phone a handsome look, but it can be divisive due to how it feels in the hand and how it can interfere with using the display for some people. I didn't have trouble with mistouches when using the Honor 50.Watching the new The Batman trailer side by side on the Honor 50 and the OnePlus Nord 2 revealed that while the Honor phone manages a much brighter overall image on its slightly larger display, its colors are cooler and the contrast isn’t as bold as what you get on the Nord 2.I think the Honor 50 just falls behind the Nord 2 in this area, though the Honor phone gains some points back by having that 120Hz panel; the Nord 2 maxes out at 90Hz.Power management is also a strong point of the Honor 50. The phone offers 66W charging out of the box, precisely one watt more than OnePlus does with the Nord 2. After charging the phone myself, I found it reached 50% full in 15 minutes and 87% full in 30 minutes, with 100% arriving at the 44-minute mark. That's pretty zippy, but the dual-cell battery design of the Nord 2 beats that, filling to 100% from empty in 30 minutes, despite having a slightly larger total capacity than the Honor 50.At 4,300 mAh, the Honor 50 has one of the smallest batteries in a phone of its size currently on sale. Considering the quality and brightness of the display this battery has to power, I feared that this phone won't last that long during a day of normal use. But after performing a rundown test by playing a YouTube video non-stop at medium brightness over Wi-Fi, the Honor 50 actually lasted 7 hours and 40 minutes — nearly an hour longer than the Nord 2 lasted on the same test. Clearly Honor didn't need all the extra capacity in the end.That’s not the entire story involving the Honor 50. Here’s a quick look at some of the phone’s other features and whether they make the Honor 50 a worthwhile purchase.Honor 50 software: While this goes without saying on most Android phones, the Honor 50 is the company's first phone in some time to use Google apps. Now that Honor has spun out from the blacklisted Huawei, you can use its latest phones like the Honor 50 as you would any other typical Android device. Magic UI 4, the company's take on Android 11, still looks attractive too, pairing well with the excellent display. However I can't forgive the lack of an app drawer for more convenient access to everything you've downloaded. All your apps are just spread across multiple homepages whether you like it or not.Honor 50 performance: The Snapdragon 778G chip in the Honor 50 is paired with either 6GB or 8GB RAM. Despite my review unit using 6GB RAM — half the memory of the top-tier OnePlus Nord 2 model — the Honor 50 kept up on the Geekbench 5 general performance benchmark. But in the gruelling 3D Mark Wild Life Extreme graphical benchmark, it did a fair bit worse.Trying out Genshin Impact on the Honor 50 made the phone uncomfortably hot after just a couple of minutes. Despite a generally stable performance with the game set to 60fps, there were still some distractingly jagged edges around the characters, some unfortunate pop-in and a couple of stutters. depending on the environment I was exploring. It's a pity that in spite of the excellent display, the Honor 50 is not going to make for an excellent gaming phone. Since I was trying out the 6GB RAM version of the phone, perhaps this issue is reduced or eliminated with the 8GB model. Honor 50 design: Given Honor's intended audience is the ""global youth"", I'm impressed with how restrained and handsome the 50 can be. The phone is on offer in two quite loud colorways: the letter-splattered Honor Code or the glittery Splendid Starry version. But the glossy Midnight Black, Frost Crystal or Emerald Green editions are some sophisticated hues that look awesome draped over the curved back of the phone. The Emerald Green model I got to try proved to be very bad for picking up fingerprints, but after a wipe-down with a microfiber cloth, it is a striking hue.I am still unsure what to make of the Honor 50’s rear camera block design. The main camera sitting alone in the top circle looks good, but squeezing all the other cameras into the lower circle makes me question what the point of all that unused raised space is.Happily if you aren't too fussed by the aesthetics, the Honor 50 is a fab phone to handle. Its light, slim frame also makes the device really easy to carry and use for long periods, and I found the curved back and front only made the phone easier to use, and didn't cause any unwanted taps on the screen.It's great to see Honor return to the regular Android fold with a competent device in the form of the Honor 50. The new phone covers all the basics like you'd hope at this price, while offering premium features in the form of its large, bright display and rapid charging. The cameras can sometimes keep up with the best in the category, but it may require some patience to get the best images possible.With phones in this segment though, it's often about what the manufacturer has had to leave out to keep the price down. For me it's the chipset, or perhaps the lack of RAM even in the phone's highest specced version, that lets the phone down. You shouldn't struggle if you're a typical user, but perhaps go for a phone like the Realme GT if you want to get the most power for your money at this price point.Anyone interested in the Honor 50 should probably check out the OnePlus Nord 2 first, since I feel it's a more consistent device overall. Any potential U.S. customers shouldn't be too worried about the lack of availability either, since there are plenty of great phones you can get in the States, like the Samsung Galaxy A32 5G or the iPhone SE, that occupy the same spot that the Nord 2 does in Europe."
4,Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-pros-and-cons,"The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the best Android phone you can buy right now. It packs in all of the features you could possibly want in a phone, especially if you prefer big screens.For $1,199 — or $100 more than the iPhone 13 Pro Max — you a get dynamic 6.8-inch display and dual telephoto lenses for crazy zoom power. Plus, the S21 Ultra supports the S Pen, a first for the Galaxy S series.Display: 6.8 inches AMOLED (3200 x 1400); 10 to 120Hz CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 12GB, 16GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB Rear cameras: 108MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultra wide (f/2.2), 10MP telephoto (3x zoom, f/2.4), 10MP telephoto (10x zoom, f/4.9), laser AF sensor Front camera: 40MP (f/2.2) Video: 8K 30 fps/4K 60 fps Battery: 5,000 mAh Battery life: 11 hours 25 min (60Hz), 10:07 (adaptive) Wireless: 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, UWB Size: 6.5 x 2.97 x 0.35 inches Weight: 8.08 ouncesThe Galaxy S21 Ultra comes in a sleeker design and offers faster performance from Qualcomm's Snapdragon 888 chip. And, unlike the regular Galaxy S21, you don't have to make nearly as many trade-offs. You get a better main 108MP camera, a glass back (instead of plastic), more RAM and a higher-res display.As you'll see in my Galaxy S21 Ultra review, there are some trade-offs. But overall, this is one of the best phones money can buy for those willing to pay a premium and one of the best Android phones overall. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is available right now and you can buy carrier and unlocked versions of the phone. The Ultra starts at $1,199 and includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB of storage and to a model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The 256GB model costs $1,249 — basically an extra $50 — while you'll pay $1,379 for a Galaxy S21 Ultra with 512GB of storage.Over in the U.K, the Galaxy S21 Ultra starts at £1,149 for the 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage base model. That price rises to £1,199 for the 256GB handset and tops out at £1,329 for the model with 16GB and 512GB of internal storage.  The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is a monolith of a phone. Yes, the contour cut camera design blends the camera bump into the glass back, but this is still a massive device you’ll want to use with two hands. We've recognized as the best designed device in our Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones.With its 0.35 inch profile and weight of 8.08 ounces, the S21 Ultra is thicker and heavier than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The display is gently curved, unlike the fully flat regular Galaxy S21, but not annoyingly so. I never accidentally tapped something on screen as I did with last year’s Ultra.The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes in just two colors from carriers: Phantom Black and Phantom Silver. I might go with black because of its slimming effect. Samsung.com is offering exclusive S21 Ultra colors, though, including Phantom Navy, Phantom Titanium and Phantom Brown. Best Buy has an exclusive Navy Blue colorway, also.One of my favorite design upgrades is the 1.7x larger fingerprint sensor. It makes it easier to unlock the phone, and I found that the S21 Ultra didn’t ask me to press the sensor again like previous phones. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display on the Galaxy S21 Ultra is simply one of the best screens on a phone. It's bright, vibrant and doesn't make you choose between the highest resolution and highest refresh rate like its predecessor. Yes, you’ll be mesmerized when watching videos on this phablet. The colors are as rich as ever, and the viewing angles nice and wide when bing watching on Netflix. But the Ultra surpasses the iPhone with its dynamic refresh rate. Not only do you get super smooth scrolling and gameplay, you now get 120Hz and quad HD resolution at the same time. So you don’t have to choose between the highest resolution and highest refresh rates.The S21 Ultra is also smart enough to automatically dial the refresh rate all the way down to 10Hz to help save on power.More good news, the S21 Ultra’s display is easy to read outdoors, because it can reach a peak rated brightness of 1,500 nits. In our testing, the S21 Ultra averaged 821 nits, which beats the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 654 nits.The S21 Ultra’s screen proved plenty colorful in our lab tests, with the panel producing 81.4% of the demanding DCI-P3 color gamut, compared to 84.8% for the iPhone 12 Pro Max.The colors on the iPhone were a bit more accurate, with its screen achieving a Delta-E score of 0.07, compared to 0.35 for the Galaxy S21 Ultra. Samsung says the S21 Ultra has a 3 million:1 contrast ratio, which is 50% higher than the S20 Ultra. And there's an Eye Comfort Shield feature that's designed to reduce eye fatigue by limiting blue light. It's the cameras where the Galaxy S21 Ultra stands out the most against the S21 and S21 Plus. There's a main 108MP wide sensor and 12MP ultra-wide camera, which is complemented by a laser auto focus sensor.The Galaxy S21 Ultra will make you feel like a secret agent as you zoom in. While the iPhone 12 Pro Max is stuck at 2.5x optical zoom, the S21 Ultra packs two telephoto lenses of 3x and 10x optical zoom.I was amazed how close I got to this sign well across a highway. At 100x the zoom does get shaky but the new Zoom Lock feature can help you get a steadier shot with just a tap. The 108MP main camera can capture 12-bit HDR photos with 64 times richer color data and more than three times the dynamic range of the S20 Ultra. Plus, there's a 12-bit RAW file option in Pro mode.I tested the camera out at a nearby store to capture a shot of produce, and the green peppers in the foreground look shiny and delicious. And you can make out a pretty amazing amount of detail when you zoom in. However, by comparison, the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s shot looks even more vibrant.The Galaxy S21 Ultra is also a great partner to have when you're outdoors. Take this photo of towering trees I took at a nearby park. You can make out fine detail in the bark, and the phone does a great job capturing the clouds against the blue sky even while dealing with all of the shadows in the foreground. I slightly prefer the S21 Ultra’s photo in this case to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but it’s really close. Samsung says it has also improved the Portrait mode on the S21 by leveraging AI to better separate the subject from the background. The S21 Ultra delivers a great bokeh effect here. My skin tone is warmer on the iPhone 12 pro Max, but overall the S21 shot looks great.The Galaxy S21 Ultra also performs quite well in low light, thanks to a faster Bright Night sensor and 12MP nona-binning technology for reducing noise reduction. In this comparison you can make out more of the stones and bushes in the foreground in the S21 Ultra’s photo compared to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, although the iPhone’s colors look more natural. The iPhone 12 Pro Max pulls ahead in this photo of a golden retriever. The S21 Ultra’s pic is overly bright and a bit washed out, while his fur his more golden and natural looking with the iPhone. On the video front, the Galaxy S21 Ultra can record 8K video up to 30 fps and all of its cameras can capture 4K video at up to 60 fps. But the coolest video upgrade is Director's View.There's a new vlogger mode that lets you use the front and back cameras as the same time for recording video. And you can see live thumbnails of each camera while you're recording video, so you can make a quick call if you want to switch. The Galaxy S21 Ultra's footage looks stunning. As I swept around a river with the S21 Ultra, it delivered near movie-quality results. The dark blue water, dock and puffy clouds all came through crystal clear.And, yes, you can feel free to move around a lot while shooting. With Super Steady mode on the S21 Ultra engaged, I captured smooth footage even as I walked fast up a hill. If you want to take photos and stills at once, the Single Take 2.0 feature on the S21 Ultra is pretty fun. It managed to capture my attempt at a reverse layup in slow mo and pick a pretty good photo at the top of the jump. However, the music Samsung chooses sometimes for its auto-generated video clips sounds cheesy. The Galaxy S21 Ultra is one of the first phones powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 chip, which is complemented by 12GB or 16GB of RAM.And this is one fast Android phone. The S21 Ultra didn’t flinch as I sliced through multiple enemies in Grimvalor while delivering console-quality visuals. This flagship backs up my experience with impressive benchmark scores. On Geekbench 5, the S21 Ultra notched 3,440 on the multi-core test and 1,123 on single-core. That’s behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which cleared 4,100 and 1,600, but it’s still the best scores we’ve seen from an Android phone. The S21 Ultra also fared well on the 3DMark Wild Life graphics benchmark, hitting 34 fps. The iPhone 12 Pro Max averaged 54 fps.On our video editing test using the Adobe Premiere Rush app, the Galaxy S21 Ultra took 1 minute and 2 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. That’s faster than the Note 20 Ultra’s 1:16 but still well behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 28 seconds. Unfortunately, while you have a range of storage options to choose from for the S21 Ultra — 128, 256 or 512GB — Samsung ditched the microSD card slot. So you can't expand. If you’re looking for a phone that can last all day, this is it. On our web surfing battery test over 5G, the S21 Ultra’s 5,000 mAh endured for 11 hours and 25 minutes. That beats the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 10:53 and lands the Ultra on our best phone battery life list. Note that this time is with the standard 60Hz display mode turned on and that you’ll see less battery life with adaptive mode (up to 120Hz) engaged. In this mode we saw a runtime of 10 hours and 7 minutes. The biggest bummer is that you don’t get a charger in the box. Yes, it’s the green thing to do, but if you haven’t bought a phone in the last couple of years and don’t have USB-C, it will mean more money coming out of your pocket. Using a 25-watt charger, the S21 Ultra reached 56% in 30 minutes and 31% in 15 minutes. For the first time ever, a Galaxy S device supports the S Pen, the S21 Ultra makes that happen with a Wacom digitizer built into the display. The S Pen, which is optional, lets you draw, sketch and take notes, just as you can on the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra. It also comes in handy for quickly signing documents.Just keep in mind that the S Pen is sold separately, and you'll need to spring for a compatible case if you want to store the stylus on the go when it's not in use. Samsung sells a Silicone Cover with S Pen included for $69.99.I tried out this case, and it adds bulk to already bulky phone. The S Pen functionality worked pretty well, and you can enjoy features like Screen Off memo for quickly jotting down notes. However, because Bluetooth isn't built in, you can't use the pen as a remote control as you can with the Note 20 Ultra. So you can't skip tracks with a button press or control slideshows. Samsung is developing a second stylus. The S Pen Pro ships later this year for an undisclosed price, which will include Bluetooth connectivity. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra supports all of the latest wireless standards, starting with 5G. The Qualcomm X60 modem inside this device is capable of carrier aggregation, which should result in higher peak speeds while delivering better power efficiency.The performance was pretty solid in my neck of the woods on T-Mobile. I saw download speeds exceed 160 Mbps. It’s not fantastic, but the iPhone 12 Pro Max mustered only 100 Mbps in the same location when I popped the same SIM card in that phone. In addition, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is one of the first phones to support Wi-Fi 6E, a new standard that delivers faster speeds and more overall bandwidth when you have a compatible Wi-Fi 6E router. Lastly, the S21 Ultra has UWB (ultra-wideband), which makes it easier to share files with other UWB devices, like the Galaxy S21 Plus. And you'll be able to use this phone as a digital key for select 2022 cars. If you're constantly losing stuff — like me — you'll want to check out Samsung's new Galaxy SmartTags. You can use this tag in combination with the SmartThings Find app to track down everything from your keys to your bag. You can also use the SmartThings Find app to locate other Samsung devices, including phones, smartwatches, tablets and earbuds. We have a whole article dedicated to Galaxy S21 vs Galaxy S21 Plus vs Galaxy S21 Ultra, as there are many differences. But here are the key things to know. The Galaxy S21 Ultra has the highest resolution main camera (108MP vs 64MP for S21 and Plus), the most powerful zooms (100x vs 30x) and the sharpest display (QHD vs 1080p).In addition, the screen on the Ultra is more dynamic, as it can scale from 120Hz all the way down to 10Hz, while the panels on the regular S21 and S21 Plus go down to 48Hz. This helps save on battery life. And the S21 Ultra has the largest battery at 5,000 mAh, compared to the S21 (4,000 mAh) and S21 Plus (4,800 mAh).Lastly, the S21 Ultra has the most RAM at 12GB to 16GB, while the S21 and S21 Plus make due with 8GB. And only the S21 Ultra has a 512GB storage option. See our full Samsung Galaxy S21 review for more. The biggest competitor for the Galaxy S21 Ultra is the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Apple's phone delivers faster performance from its A14 Bionic chip, and you get a strong Ceramic Shield front display that's designed to be more durable. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is also thinner and lighter.But the Galaxy S21 Ultra has plenty of advantages over the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Samsung's phone offers more versatile cameras (especially when it comes to zooming), a 120Hz display, an in-screen fingerprint reader and longer battery life. I'd say that's worth the $100 over Apple's flagship. For more, see our in-depth Galaxy S21 Ultra vs iPhone 12 Pro Max face-off. Samsung's new foldable phones are here. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is the new kid on the block from Samsung, showcasing the company's prowess when it comes to display technology and hardware design. The Fold 3 is a big, powerful phone that Samsung has intended to succeed the venerable Galaxy Note line (RIP).The Z Fold 3 also has S Pen support like the S21 Ultra, though it has fewer cameras. Photography aficionados who prefer Samsung phones will want to stick with the S21 Ultra this year. Our Galaxy Z Fold 3 vs. Galaxy S21 Ultra face-off update is in the works, where we'll pit these two phones against each other to truly see which behemoth is the best option for you. But if you're tired of the old smartphone design, then the Galaxy Z Fold 3 (or even Galaxy Z Flip 3) is worth looking at — bearing in mind that it's quite expensive.Samsung has nearly perfected the big-screen phone with the Galaxy S21 Ultra. The display is best-in-class, the cameras are much improved and you can even use this thing as a Galaxy Note if you want to.Personally, I see the S Pen support as more of a bonus because of the added cost. There are some things I don’t like about this flagship. It’s a bit big and heavy, and the lack of a charger and microSD card slot both sting. And while the S21 Ultra is fast, it’s still a step behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Then again, Samsung’s phone lasts longer on charge and lets you do more with its cameras. Overall, if you’re looking for the pinnacle of Android phones, the S21 Ultra is it. It does, however, face stiff competition from the excellent OnePlus 9 Pro for the title of ultimate Android phone."
5,Google Pixel 5a,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-5a,"Price: $449 OS: Android 11 Display: 6.43-inch OLED (2400 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 765G RAM: 6GB Storage / Expandable: 128GB / No Rear cameras: 12.2MP (f/1.7), 16MP (f/2.2) ultrawide Front camera: 8MP (f/2.0) Battery: 4,680mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 9:45 Charging: 18W 5G: Sub-6Ghz, mmWave (US only) Size: 6.1 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches Weight: 6.5 ounces Colors: Mostly BlackThe Google Pixel 5a is a revelation in the most boring sense of the word. After the incredibly good Pixel 4a last year, some of us were left wondering how the Mountain View-based company could one up itself. While we loved the Pixel 4a — with it regularly appearing in many of our best phone lists — it had some flaws. But the Pixel 5a wows me more than tha 4a did. Essentially, this new phone is a cheaper Pixel 4a 5G with a bigger battery. Since we liked that phone a lot, too, you won’t hear me complain about getting what’s effectively a tweaked version of that phone with a $50 discount. The Pixel 5a costs $449. For that money, you get 5G connectivity (with both mmWave and sub-6Ghz networks) and the largest battery we’ve ever seen in a Pixel. That translates to real-world benefits, too, with the Pixel 5a lasting longer than almost any other Google phone that we’ve tested. It’s also the first water-resistant A-series Pixel, adopting a feature Google has long reserved for its flagship devices.In fact, I’m hard-pressed to find anything truly wrong with the Pixel 5a. It’s not the most powerful phone, and the display doesn’t wow. While budget-conscious buyers won’t like the price increase over the Pixel 4a, I don’t think these criticisms end up detracting from this phone’s merits.In this Google Pixel 5a review, I’ll go over everything that makes this one of the best Android phones you can currently buy. The $449 Pixel 5a features 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. It comes in one color option, Mostly Black. You can buy one unlocked from the Google Store and through the Google Fi wireless carrier. Here's our guide on how to pre-order the Pixel 5a.As with the Pixel 4a, the Pixel 5a’s biggest rival remains last year’s iPhone SE (2020), which starts at $399 but has half the storage of the Pixel 5a (64GB). The cheaper iPhone also makes do with a single camera versus two, and an LCD screen instead of an OLED panel.The Pixel 5a is only available in the US and Japan, possibly due to the chip shortage that led to rumors of the phone being outright cancelled earlier this year. A couple months after its release, we still don’t know if Google will expand the Pixel 5a’s availability in the future. Google's focus at the moment is on the Pixel 6, which at a starting price of $599 is just $150 more than the Pixel 5a. (We've got a Pixel 6 vs. Pixel 5a comparison to help you decide which phone is best suited for your needs.)With the exception of the new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, Google’s design language has been very minimalistic. I daresay it’s downright spartan in many respects, but it’s also pretty functional. The Pixel 5a follows in that vein, looking like an unassuming large plastic handset. Nothing about the phone stands out, except perhaps its mint-colored power button.And maybe that’s just how it should be. I love fancy-looking phones like those from Samsung or OnePlus, but I’m also a fan of function over beauty. The Pixel 5a won’t turn heads, but that’s not what Google was aiming for. Instead, this is a $449 phone that focuses entirely on software. As you’ll see in a bit, that largely translates to extraordinary camera prowess.The build quality of the Pixel 5a feels very solid, and it comes with an IP67 water-resistance rating — a first for A-series Pixel phones. Even though the 5a is a large polycarbonate slab, it has a smooth, soft-touch finish. Unfortunately, that also means it attracts fingerprint oils, which appear prominently on the black plastic. Unlike fingerprints on glass back phones, these oils can be difficult to remove with just your shirt or a microfiber cloth.There’s nothing on the Pixel 5a’s back but a simple square camera module, the fingerprint sensor, and a small Google “G” near the bottom. Around the front, there’s not much more going on, either. The big 6.34-inch display covers nearly the whole face of the phone with impressively slim bezels all around. The new phone looks like a more premium device compared to the Pixel 4a.The rear-mounted capacitive fingerprint sensor is incredibly accurate. I didn’t once have a false rejection (assuming I placed my index fingers properly) — I think this sensor is as good as the one on the Pixel 5. The placement feels very natural, as I think rear-mounted fingerprint sensors are superior to in-display ones.Like other A-series Pixels before it, the Pixel 5a still has a 3.5mm headphone jack. I love this decision still, and I think many of you will, too. Even though Bluetooth headphones and earbuds have gotten really good, having a headphone jack is still a must for many people, not to mention cars so that you can plug the phone in with an auxiliary cable.Sound quality on the Pixel 5a is very good, thanks to stereo speakers. The top speaker is nestled in the earpiece, which is a barely noticeable slit above the display. Combined with the bottom-firing speaker, the Pixel 5a can get very loud and punchy. While it lacks the bass and warmness you’d find in a pair of headphones (or higher-quality phones), the 5a has better sound than most other phones in this price range.Google is pretty proud of the Pixel 5a’s display, calling it the biggest one ever on a bezel-less Pixel, which covers the Pixel 4a, 4a 5G, and 5. At 6.43 inches, the full-HD OLED screen on the Pixel 5a is vibrant and bright. It’s not the most impressive panel we’ve ever seen, but it’s very good all the same, especially at this price. One thing I really appreciate is how easily I can see what’s on the display when I’m out in direct sunlight. When I was out wandering around to capture photos for this Pixel 5a review, I found myself surprised and impressed because I could see the photos I’d just taken. Normally, I have to find shade to see the photos clearly enough. Not so with the 5a, and not every phone that crosses my desk can claim that.Like the rest of the phone, the Pixel 5a’s display gets the job done. Neither awful nor amazing, the screen is average in the best kind of way. One area that has definitely improved over the Pixel 4a is the viewing angles. With the 4a, you’d start to notice distortion pretty quickly when viewing the phone from an off angle. I ran into no such problem with the Pixel 5a. In fact, the display has fantastic viewing angles and little visible distortion until you get to closer to 180 degrees, as you do with most phones.Once you go with an OLED screen, it’s hard to go back to LCDs on a phone. That comes down to how deep the blacks get, which lends itself to a sense of foreboding and dread in dark games like Limbo or adding stark contrast to the harsh orange scenes in Blade Runner 2049. Even Genshin Impact with its anime-style graphics or Dead Cells’ pixel art look amazing on the Pixel 5a. The resolution is just crisp enough to make nature photos almost look like you’re actually there, too. Even something as mundane as a YouTube video or sports clip looks great on this display.In its default color profile, the Pixel 5a managed to reproduce 119.3% of the sRGB and 84.5% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts. That’s actually a bit more saturated than the iPhone SE’s 111.2% sRGB rendering. The iPhone has a significant advantage with color accuracy, however, with a Delta-E score of 0.2 compared to the Pixel 5a’s 0.32. (Scores closer to 0 are best in this test.)The Pixel 5a is like most other Android phones out there, in that you can only achieve maximum brightness with Adaptive Brightness enabled. In our testing, the phone reached a 501-nit max, which is surprisingly lower than the Pixel 4a’s 681 nits and the iPhone SE’s 651-nit average. But like I said above, I had no trouble viewing the display out in direct sunlight.Adaptive Brightness uses AI to judge how you like your display brightness in certain lighting conditions. that requires you to train the feature, which I doubt most people do — I just let my phones adjust automatically. On some previous Pixels, a few people (including Adam Ismail in his Pixel 4a review) reported a general sense of indecisiveness with Adaptive Brightness. I ran into this problem on my Pixel 4 XL, which would vary wildly while sitting in one spot. I haven’t noticed this frustrating problem with the Pixel 5a.The biggest highlight with the Pixel 5a this year is the addition of the 16MP, 117-degree ultrawide camera, which joins the primary 12.2MP shooter. Last year’s Pixel 4a only had the single 12.2MP camera. Up front, the Pixel 5a’s 8MP selfie cam sits nestled in the top left corner of the display in a hole-punch cutout.This is a Pixel, so you’d expect the photography experience to be really good, especially given that the 5a has almost the same hardware as the Pixel 5. As you’ll see below, the Pixel 5a’s cameras meet that expectation and then some — they’re the best you’ll find under $500.When testing the Pixel 5a against an iPhone SE, you can immediately see the differences in approach between the two phones in this photo of some flowers. The Pixel 5a kept a more natural color profile, while the iPhone SE looks a bit too saturated and fantastical. The iPhone’s image also looks too cool, especially given the daylight’s overall warm tones in this scene. I prefer the Pixel’s shot.To see how well either phone captured vibrant color, I took a picture of this pickup truck. The blue is very bright, dazzlingly so in direct light. The Pixel once again opted for a more somber look to complement the overcast sky above. The truck’s blue paint is still beautiful in the Pixel’s image. However, with the iPhone SE, Apple’s phone turned up the saturation again. You can also see the evidence of this in the grass behind the truck, and even on the lighter portion of the wooden fence in the background. Heading inside, the Pixel 5a and iPhone SE took their own approaches to this statuette of Merida. WIth the 5a, the image is cool, but still captures the vibrant colors of Merida’s dress and hair, plus the yellow candle off to the right. The iPhone took a warmer image, a bit too yellow in my opinion. However, both phones compensated for the light in the room, producing well-lit photos.The portrait shots were also quite different, and the results surprised me. Apple pioneered the portrait photo mode years ago, but the Pixel 5a offers a much better and more artistic photo in this particular comparison. The iPhone SE zoomed out and had a softer bokeh effect, while the Pixel 5a focused solely on my face. The background is beautifully blurred, too.The night modes differ greatly between the two phones, mostly because the iPhone SE doesn’t have one. This remains a strange omission on Apple’s part, but the Pixel 5a features Google’s excellent Night Sight. You can see how well the 5a handled the smoker at night, producing a clear image with plenty of detail. The smoker is still visible in the iPhone SE’s photo, but it’s harder to see.A familiar pattern repeated itself when I tested the front camera. The Pixel 5a kept the colors toned down, giving my face a more natural look. The SE, meanwhile, cranked up the saturation and made my face look splotchy and unhealthily red. If my face isn’t proof enough, look at the pool umbrella in the background. It’s way too green for something that’s sat out in the sun for years.The Pixel 5a can record video up to 4K at 60 frames per second. Google also includes what it calls Cinematic Pan for capturing audio-less video clips. This effectively slows down the panning in your video clip, adding a more artistic, cinematic effect. Compared to the iPhone SE, the Pixel 5a’s video is simply better. Colors are more accurate, the mic quality is much better, and Google’s new phone focuses on close objects faster. Even the stabilization on the Pixel 5a is good, right on par with the SE’s. Google has gotten steadily better with video recording lately, and the 5a is definitely one of the best Pixels so far at this task.It may not have the Google-built Tensor chip introduced in the new Pixel 6 lineup, but the Pixel 5a takes a serious step up from its predecessor in terms of hardware. Rocking a Snapdragon 765G (the same system-on-chip as the $699 Pixel 5 and $499 Pixel 4a 5G from last year) and 6GB of RAM, this is a decently powerful phone for many tasks. As far as Android phones go, the Pixel 5a is pretty middle of the road.The 765G isn’t a bad chip and it’s an improvement over the Pixel 4a’s Snapdragon 730G system-on-chip. But the Snapdragon 765G is not going to hold up well against the A13 Bionic in the iPhone SE. Apple’s silicon magic makes the $399 iPhone SE a little powerhouse that even the best Android phones struggle to match. At $449, though, the Pixel 5a is about as powerful as Android devices in this price category get.Playing games on the Pixel 5a was a fine experience, though some of the more intense titles like Asphalt 9 and Genshin Impact caused the phone to heat up. Lowering the graphics settings can help, especially with dropped frames, but the Pixel 5a isn’t truly proficient at gaming in the way more powerful flagship phones are.However, in day-to-day tasks, this phone flies. Android 11 on the Pixel 5a feels buttery smooth, even with a display locked at 60Hz. Outside of gaming, I couldn’t get this phone to slow down, whether I was rapidly scrolling on a big web page, switching between several apps and games on the fly, or taking multiple photos in quick succession.Having the power of the Snapdragon 765G helps the Pixel 5a process photos quickly. Google’s software magic really shines on the Pixel 5a, and it’s thanks in part to the big processor upgrade over the Pixel 4a. As far as benchmarks go, we ran into some compatibility issues with Geekbench 5. I couldn’t download the app from the Play Store and the scores we did manage to get in lab testing (from sideloading) were startlingly low, much lower than the ones we saw from the Pixel 4a with its Snapdragon 730G. That said, the Pixel 5a did pass through the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited graphics test, managing a score of 1,678 with an average fps of 10 — this, once again, seems really low for a 765G. Regardless, it’s chump change compared to the iPhone SE’s 47.9 fps average. The A13 Bionic is still an incredibly powerful chip, and it makes the iPhone SE the performance champ in the sub-$500 category.Still, even if the Pixel 5a’s performance feels middling, that’s not really a bad thing. Google’s phone does most everything a phone ought to without any trouble.The Pixel 5a sports the biggest battery we head seen in a Google Pixel, though the Pixel 6 Pro now tops that. Nevertheless, the Pixel 5a's 4,680 mAh power pack helps it turn in one of the better times we've seen from a Pixel phone on our battery test. That's not a high bar to clear, though, as Pixels tend to falter on our test involving web surfing over a cellular connection. To that end, the Pixel 5a was able to remain powered up for 9 hours and 45 minutes, which is around the average for smartphones. That beats the Pixel 4a's time by nearly an hour, and it's roughly 30 minutes longer than the iPhone SE's result. Given Google's historical struggles on our test, it's nice to see the phone at least in the neighborhood of average performance. But given the size of the battery, we wish the Pixel 5a had come closer to landing on our best phone battery life list.Pixel 5a charging is less encouraging. With a max of 18W, the Pixel 5a got from a drained phone to 23% in 15 minutes, and to 43% in 30 minutes. That handily beats the iPhone SE’s charging times, which only reached 29% in 30 minutes in our testing. However, there’s no wireless charging onboard the Pixel 5a, unlike Apple’s budget iPhone.Android 12 is rolling out now, and that includes to the Pixel 5a. That’s one of the benefits of owning a Google phone — you get Apple-level access to the latest Android versions on the day they’re released. Now if only the Pixel 5a would be supported for as long as an iPhone.With Google debuting its own system-on-chips (called Tensor) for the Pixel 6, maybe we’ll see future Pixels stay updated as long as iPhones do. Nonetheless, the Pixel 5a will still see three years of platform updates and a minimum of three years of security patches. Out of the box, the Pixel 5a comes standard with stock Android 11. There’s nothing new here, since Android 11 is a fairly spartan affair. There is a section to customize some of the 5a’s gestures, like swiping on the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notification shade. That’s about it. If you’re coming from Samsung or OnePlus — or even Motorola — you might find the lack of customization and features to be a bit of a shell shock. That said, Android 12 is going to change that.The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro introduce more significant changes to Google's phone lineup, but the Pixel 5a is worth strong consideration if you want the Google software and camera experience for a lower price. Despite $449 being a $100 hike from last year’s phone, the Pixel 5a delivers almost everything that the $699 Pixel 5 managed, minus the 90Hz display, for $250 less.The Pixel 5a’s claim to fame comes down to its cameras, and boy do they deliver. This phone runs laps around anything at this price, even the iPhone SE. Apple’s budget iPhone isn’t a bad camera phone by any means, but the 5a is just better all around. This should come as no surprise to anyone who knows that Pixels regularly feature in our picks for the best camera phones.Despite the battery life not knocking my socks off, I really like the Pixel 5a. It does everything the Pixel 4a 5G did well for $50 less, and that’s impressive. While people in other countries will feel left out that the Pixel 5a only ships in the U.S. and Japan, you should absolutely consider this phone if you want a top budget handset.There are better phones that cost upwards of $1,000 or more, but I find it difficult to consider any of them to be as good of a value as the Pixel 5a."
6,Google Pixel 5,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-5,"Price: $699 OS: Android 11 Display: 6-inch OLED (2340x1080; 90Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 765G RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB Rear camera: 12.2MP wide (ƒ/1.7), 16MP ultrawide Front camera: 8MP (ƒ/2.0) Battery: 4,000 mAh Size: 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.3 in Weight: 5.3 ozThe Google Pixel 5 confuses me because it's both a wonderful phone and a strange one because, as consumers, we’re conditioned to expect that a new version of something is better than whatever it’s replacing. That's usually the case.In some ways, the Pixel 5 is better — at $699, it costs $100 less than the Pixel 4 did. The new Pixel has a much larger battery with wireless reverse charging, 128GB of base storage, and a new ultrawide lens; and, of course, it sports 5G connectivity.However, the Pixel 5 certainly isn’t better in every way. Critically, Google has chosen a lower-tier chipset to keep costs down and ditched some of the Pixel 4’s more advanced and unique features, like its 3D Face Unlock system. It’s also hard to discuss Google’s newest range-topping phone without mentioning its $200-cheaper sibling, the Pixel 4a 5G. That phone shares the Pixel 5’s processor and camera, among other things, allowing it to match the flagship in most key areas.Thus, our Google Pixel 5 review finds a device that is very pleasant to use, but also very confused. Google clearly had to make some tough compromises here, and while there’s no doubt that the company’s once again delivered one of the best Android phones you’ll find, the Pixel 5 doesn’t even qualify as the best value in Google’s own lineup.Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones. The Pixel 5 won a highly recommended award.The Pixel 5 costs $699 and packs 128GB of storage. Interestingly, Google isn’t offering a higher storage capacity version, and the Pixel 5 doesn't support microSD cards to give you more space to work with. There are two colors — Just Black and Sorta Sage.The Pixel 5 is sold unlocked, where you can take it to any carrier of your choosing, or through AT&T, Verizon, US Cellular and Google Fi. Google has designed the Pixel 5 to connect to both sub-6GHz low- and mid-band 5G networks, as well as millimeter-wave ones, meaning that it supports the full gamut of 5G service no matter which carrier you take it to. That said, I never experienced impressive speeds during my time with the phone, even when I happened to be in range of AT&T’s nationwide 5G network. In fact, the speeds I saw were consistently in the single digits in terms of megabits per second — of course, your mileage may vary.If you've seen a Google-branded phone in the last year or two, you've virtually seen the Pixel 5. All of Mountain View's modern handsets are remarkably simple and minimalist in terms of design, with small hole-punch front-facing cameras and tiny bezels encircling the display. On the back, there's a fingerprint sensor and a square camera module packing dual optics — and that's pretty much it.There are, however, a couple minute details to point out related to the Pixel 5's design. Whereas the company's cheaper devices employ matte polycarbonate, the Pixel 5's unibody housing is crafted from recycled aluminum (save for a small, invisible hole on the back underneath the paint that permits wireless charging — more on that later.) The Pixel 5 is also IP68 water resistant, while the Pixel 4a series isn't.The finish on the Pixel 5 appears to have drawn conflicting opinions from various reviewers. Some dismiss the matte, almost candied sort of coating Google has employed on this phone as cheap-feeling. Personally, though, I’m a sucker for unique materials — especially slightly-gritty or soft-touch textures — and I love the finish of the Pixel 5. I don’t know if it’s the most “premium” feeling smartphone I’ve ever held, but such questions are highly subjective. Whatever Google’s done to achieve the Pixel 5’s earthy sort of finish, I dig it.I especially dig the Sage Green version Google sent us. This is a lovely shade of green with some faint speckles in it, giving it sort of an eggshell-like luster. It also plays off brilliantly against the chromed green power button and Google logo on the back. I am slightly concerned about this coating chipping off in high-contact areas, like around the USB-C port (my Pixel 4 unfortunately fell victim to this phenomenon), but only time and ongoing use will reveal how durable the Pixel 5’s exterior really is.Something else I adore about the Pixel 5’s design is just how damn pocketable it is. Anyone who knows me knows I love a good premium small phone, and the Pixel 5 certainly is tiny. Google has trimmed the border around this device’s 6-inch display to maximize screen real estate. It’s perhaps the closest any company has gotten to a truly all-screen phone, though it’s come at a cost — namely the Pixel 4’s Soli radar chip and 3D Face Unlock stack that were formerly stashed in the top bezel.The Pixel 5 lacks those components, which is disappointing given that the Pixel 4's authentication system was pretty phenomenal, and noticeably snappier in our testing than Apple's Face ID in the iPhone 11 and 12 series. But with most everyone still using face masks, perhaps it's not all bad.As such, you’ll have to live with an effective-yet-dated rear-mounted fingerprint sensor in the Pixel 5. This probably isn’t a deal breaking proposition for an old-school Android user, though I can certainly imagine some folks recoiling in fear at the thought of inputting a PIN code when their device is lying flat on a table. You can also swipe on that fingerprint sensor to pull down or withdraw the notification shade.Thus, there is a sense of form triumphing over function with the Pixel 5’s design, though I’m personally not very bothered by that because the result is so eye-catching and compact. It’s feather-light, too — at just 5.33 ounces, the Pixel 5 is more than an ounce lighter than the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S20 Plus, which you certainly feel the moment you hold and compare.The Pixel 5’s 6-inch OLED display touts a full-HD resolution and 90Hz peak refresh rate, which you can drop down to 60Hz in the device’s settings if you so choose. The refresh rate isn’t variable per se — unlike the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s screen, it can’t speed up or down dynamically to any pace at will — though Google says the Pixel 5 switches between 60Hz and 90Hz depending on the type of content presented.It's worth noting that the Pixel 4a 5G also features an OLED panel with the same resolution as the Pixel 5's screen. But the refresh rate on the 4a 5G is capped at 60Hz, so that's one area where Google's flagship outdoes the cheaper 5G option.Pretty much all of those characteristics were true of the Pixel 4’s panel, though, meaning that not much has changed on the display front this go-around. Mind you, that’s not a criticism, considering the Pixel 4’s screen was pretty stellar all around. For what it’s worth, the Pixel 5 is at least better at maintaining 90Hz at low brightness levels — one particular area where the old device struggled.Colors on the Pixel 5 strike an excellent balance between muted realism and cartoonish oversaturation. Watching the trailer for the wonderfully surreal Iron Mask, I was so impressed by the fidelity with which the Pixel 5’s panel rendered Arnold Schwarzenegger’s magnificent sideburns that I momentarily forgot to laugh at the prospect of Arnold Schwarzenegger with sideburns.The Pixel 5’s display gets decently bright, though not as bright as its competition, topping out at 610 nits when adaptive brightness is enabled. For comparison’s sake, the $599 iPhone 11 managed 652 nits, while the Galaxy S20 FE managed 679 nits. Meanwhile, Google’s phone covered 128.8% of the sRGB color space, which happened to be slightly punchier than the 122.8% of the more expensive Galaxy Note 20.The Pixel 5 features a dual-lens camera system that's equal parts familiar and new for Google's handsets. The primary 12.2-megapixel lens is a mainstay of the Pixel brand; it's been around since the Pixel 2 days, and Google mostly relies on software enhancements to continually improve its output.The secondary shooter, however, is a new 16MP ultrawide camera, which replaces the telephoto lens employed in last year's version. Google drew criticism for offering a telephoto lens with a very slight optical zoom advantage in the Pixel 4, rather than an ultrawide optic. I believe this was the right call, as I suspect most Pixel 5 buyers will find the addition of an ultrawide camera more useful than a telephoto — especially considering Google’s Super Res Zoom technology is so effective at achieving lossless digital zoom.Here, we see a comparison between the ultrawide shooters on the Pixel 5 and also brand-new OnePlus 8T, and it’s honestly hard to choose between the two. While OnePlus’ camera demonstrates a wider field-of-view, the tradeoff is more distortion at the fringes than you’ll notice in the Pixel 5’s rendition. On the other hand, Google’s superior processing deftly colors in those darker, shadowy regions about halfway down the alley, with more nuanced blacks, grays and dark greens than OnePlus’ more contrast-heavy tuning can provide.Heading inside, we have a pair of portraits of yours truly that highlight how the Pixel 5 keeps Google firmly in the best camera phone conversation. Everything about the Pixel 5’s take is sharper, from my beard, hair and skin to the fibers in my sweater. I’m also impressed with the superior gradation in color within low-light areas (like my left shoulder), and simply pleased with how much more lifelike the colors are all around. There’s just no contest here.The bar above offers a good opportunity to demonstrate the Pixel 5’s excellence in handling medium-lighting scenarios that present a general lack of natural light with intense artificial sources, like neon signs. This is typically a challenging scenario for phones, and while I feel as though both these devices navigate it well, the Pixel 5 edges OnePlus’ best efforts thanks to its ability to isolate the brightest lights and hone in on textures, like the specular highlights glinting off the concrete countertop and the rustic wooden floor below.Here, 2x digital zoom was used on both the Pixel 5 and OnePlus 8T, and once again it’s Google’s device that stands out with better definition, bolder colors and pleasing contrast. The tree near the center of the frame denotes a clear point of distinction between these two photos; on the Pixel 5, you can discern between the individual leaves, whereas the OnePlus 8T melds them all into one amorphous, verdant blob.However, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the Pixel 5. In this example we see it struggle at dusk, bathing the entire alley before you in a deep and desolate blue. The OnePlus 8T balanced all the colors in the frame better, though it fell down once again in the sharpness department.But when things get really dark and it’s time to call upon Night Sight, the Pixel 5 really shines. The iPhone 11 Pro costs $300 more than the Pixel 5, and I’d say its performance here isn’t anywhere near the level of Google’s device. Everything is much too warm, and fidelity is clearly lacking in the big tree at the center and the lawn nearest to the camera. The Pixel is also far more successful at accurately representing the colors of various objects in the scene, like the tree’s greenish-yellow leaves and the maroon sedan parked on an adjacent street.Apple’s flagship phone is more susceptible to noise judging by this image, though it has to be said that the iPhone did process this photo in almost half the time it took the Pixel 5 to do the same — 3 seconds, versus 5. That’s clearly a case of Apple’s hardware flexing its muscle relative to the far less powerful Pixel, which we’ll explore a little later in this review.Finally, we end on another pair of pictures of your humble reviewer — though, this time, I spurned the assistance of a willing party and employed the Pixel 5’s front-facing 8MP camera to capture it.Again, this is another case where Google’s imaging outperforms rivals with far more impressive specs on paper, using a combination of ordinary hardware and extraordinary software. The OnePlus 8T might have a 32MP selfie shooter, but it obviously hasn’t helped much, based on the unflattering reddish tone that device’s camera lent to shadows in my face. Of course the Pixel’s result could stand to be a hair sharper, but overall, at least it left me looking like there was life left in my eyes.Before we move on from the camera section entirely, we should note that Google has punched up its video recording arsenal with the Pixel 5’s release by offering a range of electronic stabilization modes. There’s standard stabilization, which seeks to dull tremors caused by shaky hands, as well as modes targeted for shooting subjects at far distances, another for active or fast-moving subjects, and yet another for slow-motion, panning shots.The new stabilization options work well, though they’re certainly not immune to judder. You will notice moments where the camera interpolates frames in a blurry fashion to diminish the sensation of unexpected movement, so it’s still important to take care to maintain composure when shooting.Google’s decision to equip the Pixel 5 with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, rather than the Snapdragon 865 employed by the fastest Android flagships, has certainly left critics and enthusiasts alike scratching their heads.It’s not that the 765G is poor silicon — far from it. The 765 series certainly delivers good enough performance in the likes of the OnePlus Nord and LG Velvet. Rather, the skepticism stems from where the Pixel 5 sits within Google’s roster of phones.As it happens, the 765G is also employed in the Pixel 4a 5G, which costs $200 less than the Pixel 5. And to make matters even more confusing, Google’s insistence on going with a more modest CPU means the new Pixel 5 isn’t even as fast as last year’s Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL.Google’s strategy here befuddles me to no end, though that’s a discussion for another day. The more pressing concern is what all that means for the Pixel 5’s performance, and I’m happy to report that at least this phone doesn’t feel as slow as some will worry it is.To Google’s credit, the company has bumped up the RAM in this device to 8GB, which is more than the Pixel 4 had at its disposal. (It's also more than the 6GB of memory inside the Pixel 4a 5G.) And the 90Hz display certainly promotes the illusion of speed with every tap and scroll, even if the hardware under the surface is decidedly more pedestrian.But of course, the numbers aren’t encouraging. In the system-wide Geekbench 5 test, the Pixel 5 delivered a multicore score of 1,617 points. That’s certainly a far cry from the Galaxy S20 FE’s 2,928 points, making this a good time to reiterate that the Galaxy S20 FE costs exactly the same as the Pixel 5. To add insult to injury, the now-defunct Pixel 4 scored 2,329 points.In spite of that gulf in general performance, it’s not everyday tasks where you’re likely to test the limits of that 765G chip. Rather, that’s best reserved for more strenuous pursuits, like gaming. In GFXBench’s Vulkan Aztec Ruins graphics test for high-tier devices, the Pixel 5 totaled 438 frames, averaging 7 frames per second. The Galaxy S20 FE, on the other hand? 1,325 frames at 21 frames per second. That’s exactly three times better.A better judge of real-world performance is our video encoding test, where we task devices with transcoding a short 4K video clip to 1080p in Adobe’s Premiere Rush app. The iPhone 11 was able to do this in 46 seconds. The Pixel 5 needed 2 minutes and 25 seconds.Indeed, you can play games on the Pixel 5; they just won’t look all that good, or run as smoothly as they would on beefier hardware. I can attest to the fact that Asphalt 9 Legends is indeed playable on this device, though I’d much rather experience that arcade racer on a phone like the OnePlus 8T, which actually has the power to max out its 120Hz display while running that demanding title.The Pixel 5 isn’t slow, and I honestly doubt the majority of users are likely to notice what power it lacks. But I also believe that at $700, you should get the most for your money — and after two or three years of ownership, when things begin to bog down, I’d rather have something that was more powerful at the start.Previous Pixel phones have certainly struggled in the battery department, so the Pixel 5's 4,080-mAh power pack will hopefully go a long way to quelling those concerns. That's an increase of nearly 1,300 mAh compared to the Pixel 4, and I imagine it must have been a massive engineering feat to shoehorn such a gigantic battery into such a small footprint and thin frame.In Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where devices endlessly load web pages over a data connection until they run out of juice, the Pixel 5 lasted for 9 hours and 29 minutes at its default 90Hz mode. That’s an improvement of one hour and 26 minutes over the Pixel 4, also when running at 90Hz. Some may argue that’s a rather underwhelming showing given the big increase in battery capacity, though it’s important to point out that the Pixel 5 has power-guzzling 5G modems and radios the Pixel 4 never had to deal with.It’s also right in line, if not a little better than the Pixel 5’s current Android rivals. The Galaxy S20 FE also managed 9 hours, but that was at 60 Hz; attempt that same test at the phone’s optimal 120Hz setting, and it would assuredly underperform that result by at least another hour.Likewise, if you want to maximize battery life as much as possible with the Pixel 5, you can opt for 60Hz instead of 90Hz. Running the test this way, we saw an improvement of about 30 minutes.But battery tests only tell part of the story in the Pixel 5’s case. Google’s lavished a wealth of battery-extending software on the Pixel 5, including its Adaptive Battery system that intelligently regulates power draw so that only the apps you use the most consume the bulk of it. Additionally, a new Extreme Battery Saver mode goes even further, pausing activity for all apps except for the ones you deem essential.Like the Pixel 4 before it, the Pixel 5 can charge wirelessly. The difference this time is that the phone can also wirelessly charge other devices, using Google’s new Battery Share feature. If you happen to have a pair of Bluetooth earbuds, for example, with a wireless charging case, you can rest them on the back of the Pixel 5 for a little boost.As you’d expect with any Google phone, the Pixel 5 launches with Android 11 and is guaranteed three years of major updates. Android 11 adds some beneficial features, like screen recording, bubbles for messaging apps and the ability to grant temporary permissions to apps; you can read our full Android 11 review for a deeper dive into what’s new.But this being a Google phone, the Pixel 5’s software story is about more than simply having the latest version of Android. Google has once again gifted its own phones with some really clever features that make the most out of its expertise in artificial intelligence, like Hold For Me.Hold For Me quite literally does what it says on the tin. If you’re placed on hold, you can call upon your Google Assistant to stay on the line for you and listen for an operator when they arrive. When that happens, you’re notified and invited to return to the call.Hold For Me only works for 1-800 numbers. Given that many companies these days (the more humane ones, anyway) have a system where they’ll call you back when it’s your turn, I don’t quite think Hold For Me is as useful as, say, Call Screen, which can literally fend off robocalls on your behalf, or the Google Recorder with built-in transcription. But it is nice to have.While I wasn’t able to use Hold For Me in a realistic scenario during my review, my Pixel 5 did offer me assistance when I dialed a 1-800 test number. I initiated Hold For Me, and when the Google Assistant detected that the automated system on the other end needed my input, it vibrated to signal me to return to the call. Pretty neat.The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are finally here. Both phones are massive improvements over the Pixel 5 in terms of power, design, and displays. While the Pixel 5 isn't bad at any of those, it has room for improvement. That's where the Pixel 6 series comes in.Of course, the highlight of the next Pixel phones is the Tensor system-on-chip, designed by Google. It's the first time that Google has gone with its own silicon for a Pixel and could be the start of something wonderful. The cameras certainly performed beyond our expectations, especially the Pixel 6 Pro. But for more budget-conscious customers, the $599 Pixel 6 is a steal and has the same Tensor chip as the Pro. It also has a 90Hz display and the same 50MP main and 12MP ultrawide cameras. Battery life remains a problem for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but that could be down to the older Samsung 5G modem that both phones use. Still, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are significant upgrades over the Pixel 5 and well worth considering.As much as I like the Pixel 5, it’s hard to make a case for buying one — at least at full price.The $700 mark has become the new battleground for phone makers looking to woo buyers with top-tier specs, without forcing them to spend upward of a grand. This competition is producing really compelling phones, from Samsung’s Galaxy S20 FE to the OnePlus 8T and likely Apple’s just-announced iPhone 12 mini. The Pixel 5 is a poor value in light of those alternatives.Mind you, there’s plenty to like here. It’s heartening to see Google finally take battery life seriously after years of dismissing that concern. And once again, I’m smitten with the refreshingly cute, trendy and compact aesthetic Google’s settled on for the Pixel, amongst a sea of bulky, garish slabs.However a phone isn’t merely a fashion piece or a camera. And speaking of the Pixel 5’s wonderful camera, you can get it in the $499 Pixel 4a 5G — hell, you can get it in the $349 Pixel 4a. Since the Pixel 4a 5G offers the same dual camera array as the Pixel 5, the same processor and the same 5G connectivity but for $200 less, it's hard to recommend the Pixel 5 over Google's less expensive phone if you're looking for a 5G device.Those who love Pixel phones do so because of the software, and Google has done well to make that software accessible in much cheaper phones. Unfortunately for Google, that very ambition has almost neutralized any reason one might want to purchase a Pixel 5."
7,Microsoft Surface Duo,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-duo,"Price: $1399 (MSRP) / $649 (Current) OS: Android 10 Display: Two 5.6-inch AMOLED (1800x1350); 8.1 inches combined CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB/256GB microSD slot: None Camera: 11MP (ƒ/2.0) Battery: 3,577 mAh Size (closed): 5.71 x 3.67 x 0.39 inches Size (open): 5.71 x 7.35 x 0.18 inches Weight: 8.8 ouncesThe Microsoft Surface Duo is a beautiful tragedy. I've never been simultaneously enamoured and frustrated with a phone, even if it feels a little unfair to call the Surface Duo a 'phone' in the purest sense of the word. The reality is it's a productivity powerhouse that just happens to be able to handle calls and text messages.When you think about things that way, it's easy to call the Surface Duo a success. It's capable of things no other phone can do efficiently. But at the same time it struggles with some of the basics. Software is glitchy thanks to the dual-screen design, camera performance is mediocre, and it packs in a bunch of outdated hardware. Th phone may well be crafted meticulously, but that price tag is still astronomically high.The overall result is a charming handset that is still difficult to recommend. While it's a little too rough around the edges to be able to claim a place on our list of the best phones, our Microsoft Surface Duo review showcases what makes this one of the most curious devices of recent times.The Surface Duo is on sale now, though if you want to be able to buy it on contract you'll have to go through AT&T. If you want to take the phone to Verizon or T-Mobile, you’ll have to pick up one of the unlocked models. Originally the Surface Duo would have set you back $1,399, and for that you get a device with 128GB of storage and no microSD card slot for expandable memory. If you wanted double that capacity, it would have set you back $1,499.That said, Microsoft has made some hefty price cuts on this phone since the start of the year. It dropped to $1,000 ahead of the phones international release, and dropped down to $649 this past May. That's over 50% off the original price, and the 128GB model is still available at that discounted price point. The 256GB model is a slightly more expensive $699.Of course that will only buy you last year's model. With the Surface Duo 2 starting at $1,499, you want to pick up one of those instead. Not only does it have a faster Snapdragon 888 processor, it also packs in a bunch of features the original Surface Duo lacked, like Surface Slim Pen 2 support, and new, more versatile, design.The Surface Duo looks dull in pictures, it has to be said. In an age of devices with flexible displays, the Duo has two separate, conventional 5.6-inch Gorilla Glass-shrouded panels with gigantic bezels. The phone’s exterior is clad in white painted glass with a matte white frame, and all that exists to break that up is the stainless-steel double-barrel hinge and similarly-mirrored Microsoft logo.But then you hold the Surface Duo, and in spite of this drab and somewhat dated motif, it feels incredibly special.A lot of that has to do with just how phenomenally slender the Surface Duo is. At just 4.8 millimeters thin, Microsoft’s dual-screen phone is about as thick when shut as the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra when you factor in the enormous camera bump on Samsung’s device. As smartphones have gotten progressively more complex over the past decade, phone makers have had to concede thinness to fit larger batteries and antenna arrays for faster data speeds.Returning to a device of wafer-like proportions like the Surface Duo rekindled an amazement in compact mobile technology I haven’t felt in quite a long time. (Though I’d still appreciate a little less bezel around the display.)It helps too that the build quality is impeccable. For such a slim phone, the Surface Duo feels remarkably sturdy and balanced no matter how you hold or orient it. The hinge strikes the perfect midpoint between being rigid and resistant enough to remain in place when tented up on a table, while also being smooth and compliant enough to pry open easily. There’s a pleasing muffled clap to shutting the Surface Duo, rather than the glass-on-glass snap you might expect; it’s just a joy to physically interact with, from start to finish, and it’s that attention to detail that kept me eager to use it during the review phase.The Surface Duo feels incredibly special, and a lot of that has to do with how phenomenally slender this design is.All that said, the Surface Duo’s proportions do come with a few drawbacks, regardless of how good the device might feel in hand. The slenderness of this device meant Microsoft had nowhere to fit wireless charging or NFC coils for tap-and-pay transactions — two features you’d surely expect on a $1,400 phone. It also means the device has a hard time staying cool when put through its paces. When the Surface Duo is being strained — if you’re in a video call, for example, and both screens are on — you can feel it complain right then and there, as the back center of the right half of the device heats up awfully quick.Additionally, given its width (the Surface Duo is seven-tenths of an inch wider than the Galaxy Note 20 when closed) this is not a device that’s natural to carry around in a front pocket. Thus, you might naturally think to stash it in your back pocket, though I wasn’t comfortable doing that either because of how far the top of the phone stuck out of my jeans. For how hard Microsoft clearly worked to make the Surface Duo as compact as it is, it’s still unwieldy at times.The dual-display design makes the Surface Duo well suited for multitasking or interacting with two apps at once.Oh, and one more design oddity: Microsoft is generous enough to include a bumper case in the box with the Surface Duo, which should be industry-standard practice with devices that cost this much. However, be sure to take care when applying it. I say “apply” because the bumper doesn’t just snap around the edges of the phone; it’s a rubbery silicone jacket with peel-away adhesive encircling the inner grooves. It’s easy enough to put the case on; just be aware that after you do, you won’t want to take it off, unless you’re willing to shell out money for a replacement. The bumper also collects lint like nobody’s business.Critics may lament Microsoft’s decision to go with two 5.6-inch AMOLED screens on the Surface Duo rather than one big bendy one, but there are reasons for the approach. Aside from all the obvious benefits to durability and cost-saving, as well as the fact Microsoft wants the Surface Duo to stand up to the rigors of its Surface Pen, the dual-display design makes this device better suited for multitasking or interacting with two apps at once to complete tasks more swiftly.Microsoft prefers to envision each of the Duo’s displays as natural windows, which is certainly the most intuitive way I’ve ever heard a company pitch a device with multiple screens. In this sense, the gap presented by the hinge doesn’t really matter, because for the most part, the user isn’t really encouraged to spread a single app across two disparate panels anyway.The only scenario in which using both screens for one window is particularly useful is when turning the Surface Duo on its side. In that pose, the two 4:3, 5.6-inch displays comprise one 8.1-inch canvas that takes on a narrower aspect ratio, making it very accommodating for scrolling through webpages or social media feeds.Nevertheless, I have some qualms with Microsoft’s insistence on 4:3 screens: most Android apps aren’t built to put wider aspect ratios to good use, and so you end up with a lot of extraneous space in Spotify and Slack, to name two apps. Typing is made easier by the way Microsoft breaks up its Swiftkey keyboard for one-handed use, depending on which side you’re approaching it from. However, the keyboard becomes a little too wide and cumbersome when holding the Surface Duo sideways (in an orientation I like to call “Nintendo DS-style”), where the text field is partitioned off to the upper panel as you type on the bottom one.The 4:3 aspect ratio also isn’t conducive to watching media, resulting in a lot of black bordering in YouTube. That said, your content will still look good on either of the Surface Duo’s 1800 x 1350 displays, as Microsoft has gone to great lengths to ensure that the color temperature and brightness of both screens is as close to identical as possible. Indeed, I noticed no difference in the presentation of apps, videos and games across both of the Duo’s screens.That’s an important detail to reiterate, because panel variation tends to be a persistent and hard-to-eliminate problem for dual-screen hardware, like the LG V60 ThinQ 5G. Under our light meter, we measured peak brightnesses for 458 nits on the left display and 461 nits on the right. Colors are also very close, with the Duo rendering 133.9% and 132% of the sRGB color space on the left and right panels, alongside Delta-E color accuracy ratings of 0.26 and 0.28, respectively.That’s in line with other top-rated devices, like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which notched 121.5% and 0.24 in those tests. It’s worth noting, however, that the Note gets much brighter, peaking at 662 nits, and also features a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate for smoother animations — something you won’t find on Microsoft’s phone.Opening apps, placing them where you want and running them side by side in harmony — this is where the Surface Duo shines.No matter how nice the Surface Duo feels to hold, or how pretty its displays look, the software experience was always going to make or break this phone. While Google has updated Android over the years with provisions for flexible and multi-screen devices, this is still an operating system that, at its core, isn’t really intended for anything like what Microsoft is trying to do here.When the Surface Duo works, it really does work. I love how simple and intuitive Microsoft has made the system for moving apps between the displays. Each screen has its own gesture navigation bar, as is common in many Android phones. However, when an app is open in one screen, you can pull up from that bar and flick the app over to the other panel if you’d rather have it there, or place it between both screens to extend it across. You can also pull up the Recents page — an overview of all your running software — and shuffle apps from side-to-side from that interface as well.Opening apps, placing them where you want and running them side by side, in harmony — this is where the Surface Duo shines. Like on Samsung’s foldables, you can create shortcuts that open two apps of your choosing together; you can even select which sides they default to. I quickly made this a part of my morning routine, setting Microsoft News and Slack to open simultaneously so I could catch up with the day’s news while also discussing topics to cover with my colleagues.The Surface Duo is also one of a small yet growing number of Android phones (the others being recent Samsung models) that support both Link to Windows and phone screen mirroring via Windows 10’s Your Phone app. With Your Phone on desktop, you can respond to texts, view notifications, browse your device’s storage and media gallery and even navigate it, all from your PC. It’s a nice power play from Microsoft to bring some cross-platform integration between Windows and Android, though the screen mirroring feature has proven rather laggy and low-resolution in my experience, no matter whether I was using the Surface Duo or the Samsung Galaxy Note 20.Microsoft has also punched up its own Android apps, like Outlook, OneDrive and OneNote, to take advantage of the Surface Duo’s unique form factor. If you extend Outlook across both of the Duo’s displays, it will cleverly keep a view of your inbox on the left side, while allowing you to read one selected email in particular on the right. If you then begin a response and flip the device sideways, the keyboard will take over the bottom portion, while the compose field will reside up top. Dragging and dropping text and images even works across screens (provided you’re using Microsoft’s apps, anyway). Indeed, the Surface Duo can be very slick when it wants to be.The Surface Duo also supports touchscreen controls for certain games on Xbox Game Pass. While we haven't tested this feature, it does mean that you can stream compatible games to the phone and use it like a Nintendo DS.But therein lies the problem. When the Surface Duo reacts to your actions in predictable, helpful ways, you see the potential in it. Suddenly, that whole concept of “flow” that Microsoft has been proselytizing — navigating seamlessly through tasks on a pocketable device, without forcing you to relocate to a PC or tablet for duties that are simply too elaborate for a phone — seems like much more than marketing fluff.All too often, though, the Surface Duo does not respond predictably. Sometimes that’s due to obtrusive design, but it’s mostly the result of crippling, incessant glitches.My Surface Duo exhibits lag about half the times I return to the home screen. Sometimes, apps and widgets will take moments to redraw, and in other circumstances they’ll be present, albeit unresponsive to taps or swipes for upward of 5 seconds. Swiping up to return home from one app or summoning the keyboard often moves and repositions the app on the other display unintentionally. Even the wallpaper on my review unit occasionally disappears, only to be replaced by solid black. Locking and unlocking the device brings it back.The SwiftKey keyboard is a particular source of consternation. It’s often unstable and occasionally resizes itself from my preset preference since the last time I used it. In one especially annoying use case, if I’m holding the Surface Duo sideways with the entire bottom display used for typing, the keyboard frequently disappears without warning as I’m actively tapping away on it.All too often, the Surface Duo does not respond predictably, and it’s mostly the result of crippling, incessant glitches.The Surface Duo can be folded with its screens out, so it becomes more of a traditional, candybar-style device you can almost use with one hand. In these instances, the UI is designed so that the user can double tap the opposite display if they want to turn the device over for any reason.Unfortunately, in my experience, the double tap action rarely works as intended because the screen you don't want to use lacks palm rejection — so even when you flip the Surface Duo over, it thinks the panel facing away from you is still actively being used, and won't relinquish control to the other side.Even Google's mainstay Android apps, like YouTube and Google Duo (the video chat client, not to be confused with this phone) are easily flummoxed by the Surface's complexity. Turning the device to landscape mode while YouTube is open but a video isn't expanded to full-screen mode will cause the narrow, 4:3 orientation of the app to show in a landscape space. In other words, the app doesn't resize itself to better fit the wider crop — it just rotates the exact same window 90 degrees, thus only using about 50% of the total real estate of the screen.The list of general nuisances and bugs goes on and on — and none of those even touch upon the most concerning unintended behavior I discovered with our review unit.After a few days of using the Surface Duo, I noticed the phone no longer automatically locked itself and went to sleep when I closed it shut. Perplexing though this was on its own (it turned out a factory reset was necessary to set it right), it led to far more serious troubles down the line.One day, as I threw the Surface Duo into my bag for a little photography journey, the device’s camera must have launched; I either inadvertently opened the camera myself by double tapping the power key, or it managed to fire up on its own. Regardless, when I pulled the device out of my backpack two hours later, it was piping hot. The camera had presumably been on for two hours, reducing the battery level from 60% to 20%, all while the device was shut. The phone was so scorching, I could barely touch it; truth be told, I don’t think I’ve ever handled a device that hot before.These are the sorts of issues that drag the Surface Duo down, transforming it from a genuinely innovative and practical exercise in design to an unrelenting series of unexpected frustrations. To its credit, Microsoft did push out one firmware update during my time with the phone, and while it seems to have made app positioning and changing screen orientation a bit more reliable, the majority of those other qualms haven’t been stamped out. Weirdness can still happen, like when turning the device sideways while watching a YouTube video.Of course, these glitches should be fixable, and Microsoft has also expressed a desire to add basic functionality to the Surface Duo that isn’t present at the time I’m writing this review. For example, a double tap to wake feature isn’t supported on our review unit, though the company says it will deliver the capability soon.Similarly, there’s no action button or shortcut to flip screens while using the camera. (As I’ll later explain, this is important because the Surface Duo has only one lens, that serves both out-facing and selfie duties depending on how you’re holding the phone.) Rather, the device is just supposed to know where to put the viewfinder based on input from its motion sensors, though that approach doesn’t always work in practice. The Surface Duo development team tells us it’s sorting this out as well.Still, none of this instills confidence, considering both the Surface Duo’s high price as well as the fact that there are several other expensive phones on the market that don’t suffer these hang ups. You can spend upwards of a grand and a half on Microsoft’s promise of productivity, but it won’t buy you peace of mind.When the Surface Duo was announced in late 2019 with a Snapdragon 855 processor at the helm, many people understandably assumed Microsoft would update the device’s chipset during development with the then yet-to-be released Snapdragon 865. That chip would have also given the Surface Duo the ability to run on 5G cellular networks.However, that never came to pass. Thus, the Surface Duo enters the crowded fray of 2020 flagship phones with silicon that’s over a year old, as well as just 6GB of RAM, which is admittedly on the low end of the spectrum by today’s standard of premium handsets. Consider that the Note 20 Ultra packs twice the RAM that the Surface does, alongside a much faster Snapdragon 865 Plus CPU, even though Samsung’s device has but one screen and less of a multitasking slant.Now, the old 855 chip isn’t slow, but it’s also not blisteringly quick anymore when compared to other phones you can buy for this money. Couple that with the software gremlins already discussed, and the Duo simply doesn’t feel quite as snappy as you’d hope. Funnily enough, playing games is thoroughly pleasant, as the Adreno 640 GPU in the 855 is still adept enough to ensure a decently smooth experience playing graphically-demanding titles like Asphalt 9 Legends.Where the Surface Duo bogs down are those occasions when you’re repositioning the device while two apps are going at once. Changing orientations and moving between single-screen and dual-screen modes can either occur without a hitch, or transpire in a delayed, clunky fashion. This of course could be chalked up to more of a software optimization issue than a hardware one, but it all contributes to the perception of performance nevertheless.In terms of benchmarks, the Surface Duo’s multi-core Geekbench 5 score of 2,862 points is distant from the Note 20 Ultra’s 3,294 result, as well as the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s 3,500 score. Turning to graphics, the Surface totaled 1,073 frames in GFXBench’s Aztec Ruins test for high-tier devices, at 17 frames per second. That also paled in comparison to the Note 20 Ultra (1,455 frames) and iPhone 11 Pro Max (1,657 frames).Again, the omission of a newer Qualcomm chipset means that the Surface Duo isn’t future-proofed for 5G — whether you’re talking about long-range networks, like sub-6GHz 5G, or the much faster, short-range millimeter-wave infrastructure in cities. At the moment, that’s not a huge loss; 5G isn’t ubiquitous or performing well enough to really justify buying a particular device for its 5G support alone. That said, if you’re considering picking up a Surface Duo, it stands to reason you want to squeeze out more than a few years from your $1,400 phone. 5G might not matter much today, but that probably won’t ring true come 2022 or 2023.Microsoft’s imaging hardware and software simply can’t extract the vividity or sharpness you’d probably expect from the camera in a $1,400 smartphone.If you’re hopelessly searching the Surface Duo’s exterior for some kind of elaborate array of lenses, as so many other premium handsets tend to have these days, I regret to inform you Microsoft’s taken a considerably low-key approach to cameras. There’s just one 11-megapixel, ƒ/2.0 camera located above the right half of this dual-screen phone, and that’s the camera you use whether you’re shooting a vast landscape or an impromptu selfie.Now, that might sound like cause for disappointment, and indeed, with only one tiny 11MP lens, the Surface Duo obviously won’t pull off a caliber of photography that will embarrass the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra or any one of the other best camera phones we’ve tested. That said, the Surface Duo’s humble shooter can punch above its weight on occasion.Perhaps the best example of that is the image of a flower above, captured with the Surface Duo. While it took many attempts before I ended up with a result that was properly in focus, the detail on display in the petals and the nuance with which Microsoft’s phone captured the various shades of pink and white produced a shot that’s more visually engaging and realistic than the Galaxy Note 20’s oversaturated version of things.But it isn’t all praise for the Duo. The further you zoom in, the more you begin to notice graininess pervading darker areas of the frame as well as the background. And speaking of the background, the Note 20 surprised with a stunning natural depth-of-field effect that wasn’t intentional, but is nevertheless very pretty. The Surface Duo couldn’t match it, even when I attempted to use Portrait Mode.As it turns out, Portrait Mode on the Surface Duo needs to recognize faces to work consistently; you can’t just use it to take a dramatic bokeh shot of anything. Still, even when I used it to take a selfie, I was underwhelmed. The Duo appears to favor cool, dreary colors, compared to the iPhone’s tinge of warmth and Samsung’s penchant for punching up hues. I’m a relatively pale individual, but there’s a bit more life within me — not to mention the greenery behind me — than Microsoft’s camera would have you think. The blurring around my hair is also clearly inconsistent through the Duo’s lens, while the iPhone 11 Pro does a better job of gradually fading the foreground into the background.Sadly, things don’t get better for the Surface Duo from here. This comparison of shots from a river demonstrates how Microsoft’s imaging hardware and software simply can’t extract the vividity or sharpness you’d probably expect from the camera in a $1,400 smartphone. And while you could argue that that’s not really the purpose of the Surface Duo, when devices like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra are cheaper and camera quality is a major consideration for the vast majority of phone shoppers, you can’t overlook it, either.From inside a covered bridge, it’s clear to see the Surface duo exhibits trouble resolving the sunlight outside in this challenging scene. The Note 20 better balances the highlights in addition to the shadows within the bridge, pulling out impressive sharpness, clarity and color from the wooden beams above.The Surface Duo doesn’t have an optical zoom lens, nor does it capture enough megapixels to emulate lossless zoom with sensor cropping alone. Microsoft also hasn’t gifted this phone with a software-based solution like Google’s Super Res Zoom, and thus, the Surface Duo is woefully under-equipped when shooting from far away. The Note 20’s digital zoom can be cranked all the way up to 30x, but the Surface Duo’s tops out below 10x (an exact value isn’t provided in Microsoft’s camera app.) Alas, even at a distance of 10x for the Note 20 and an estimated 8x for the Surface Duo, the rendition from Samsung’s camera is infinitely clearer thanks to the Galaxy’s higher megapixel count and smarter zoom algorithms.Lastly, we turn to the Surface Duo’s performance in low light, which is unfortunately quite limited as this device doesn’t have a night mode like you find on countless other flagship handsets these days. This comparison serves as an illustration of what you miss out on.At the time these photos were taken, dusk hadn’t entirely concluded yet, and so there was still a bit of light in the sky for both devices to work with. The Note 20 churned out a gorgeous result, incorporating the light from the streetlamp illuminating the leaves of the tree above as well as the shine of the pavement. It’s plain to see that none of these plaudits ring true for the Duo’s shot.Regardless of how middling or disappointing the Surface Duo’s photography is, what’s even more frustrating is the user experience within the camera app. As stated earlier, the Surface Duo can be comically terrible at guessing what screen you’d like the viewfinder on, and thus, what direction you’re attempting to shoot in. The only way to attempt to change it is to turn the phone over, though that doesn’t always produce the intended response. By the time you've got the camera pointed in the proper direction — which even in the best case scenario, delays picture taking by a second or two — it’s quite possible you’ve missed your shot. I’d much rather Microsoft simply employed a manual switch button in the interface instead.Keeping both of the Surface Duo’s large displays lit is a 3,577-mAh battery that’s actually split into two units on each half of the device. That’s a somewhat impressive size, given how thin this phone is, but it’s also not a lot of juice compared to what other flagships are packing. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has a 4,500-mAh battery, and even the power-sipping iPhone 11 Pro Max has a greater capacity, at a shade under 4,000 mAh.Therefore, we didn’t expect the Surface Duo to last especially long through Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where devices are tasked with endlessly refreshing web pages until they run out of juice, over an LTE connection and while set to 150 nits of screen brightness.Given the Surface Duo’s unique setup, we ran the test in two configurations: twice with only one display active, and twice again with both screens lit. In single display mode, Microsoft’s device averaged 9 hours and 27 minutes. That fell to 7 hours and 7 minutes in dual-display mode. Both pale in comparison to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (10:26 in 60Hz mode; 7:59 in 120Hz mode) and the iPhone 11 Pro Max (11:54).The Surface Duo incorporates 18-watt USB Power Delivery charging which, coupled with the somewhat small size of the battery, helps Microsoft’s handset reach 49% from empty in 30 minutes. Some flagships, like the $899 OnePlus 8 Pro, can hit half capacity a bit more quickly, but require proprietary charging bricks and cables to do it.It's been almost a year since Microsoft launched the Surface Duo, and in that time the price has dropped pretty heavily. The question is, is it still worth buying the phone after all this time? The obvious answer is that you probably shouldn't.With the Surface Duo 2 now here, and with a $1,499 price, Microsoft has taken the best parts of the Surface Duo and improved them somewhat. It's not perfect, and still has its flaws, but it still managed to address a lot of the complaints people had about its predecessor.The Surface Duo 2 keeps the same dual screen design as its predecessor, but upgrades the chipset to the Snapdragon 888 chipset, larger 5.8-inch displays , a 90Hz refresh rate, mmWave and Sub-6 5G, and a triple-lens rear-facing camera with 12MP wife and telephoto lenses, 16MP ultrawide lens, and 2x optical zoom. There's also a 12MP selfie camera.On top of this the phone comes with a power button fingerprint scanner, support for the Surface Slim  Pen2 stylus, and a significantly larger battery. That extra capacity amounted to an extra 20 minutes of power in single display mode, and 31 minutes in dual display mode. You have to pay for these changes, but it's up to you to decide whether it's worth the extra $800.Then there's the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 to consider. While considerably more expensive than the Surface Duo was at launch at $1,800, it's still a true foldable phone. That means it has a single uninterrupted screen rather than two separate screens with a hinge. The Z Fold 3 also has powered stylus support with the S Pen, even if the optional extra does cost an additional $49 or $99 if you opt for the more powerful S Pen Pro.In other words, there are much better options than the original Surface Duo - particularly given how flawed the phone has proven itself to be. It's just up to you whether you think those phones are worth the extra money.I want to love the Surface Duo, and sometimes when I’m using it, I really do. Despite its flaws, this device feels truly special. The Surface Duo’s meticulous craftsmanship and thoughtful design supports its dual-screen ambitions remarkably well. It encourages you to try things and work in ways you previously never imagined on a mobile phone.The Surface Duo isn’t quite a smartphone, nor is it a small tablet. Yet, I could see it filling the roles of both — at least in concept — making the $1,400 price tag slightly more excusable.What isn’t excusable, however, are the myriad glitches and the disappointing compromises. There are times you’ll use the Surface Duo when you’re not entirely sure how it’s going to respond to your actions, or why it’s responded that way it’s chosen to. There are times it’ll hang when you’re doing something as simple as returning to the home screen, or the keyboard will just give up on you as you’re tapping away at an email. Whatever chains and limitations the dual-screen design eradicates, the software hiccups and general lack of responsiveness bring the whole experience crashing back down to Earth.It’s at that point you have to face the fact that the Surface Duo doesn’t give you the same amenities its flagship contemporaries do, even though it costs far more in some cases. Surface Duo users will have to live with an underwhelming camera that’s a pain to use; an outdated processor with the bare minimum of RAM; no 5G, wireless charging or NFC; and only average battery life. The more you ruminate over everything you give up, the more you’re convinced to cut your losses and go with a more reliable big-screen phone like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra instead.What surprised me most about the Surface Duo during my time with it is that it proves Microsoft right in a sense. I can recognize now that there’s enormous potential in dual-screen devices when done properly, and Microsoft has gotten closer to realizing it than anyone before them. As it stands, though, the Surface Duo’s potential is in dire need of refinement, and it’s saddled by a few too many headaches to recommend."
8,Microsoft Surface Duo 2,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-duo-2,"Starting price: $1,499 Screen size: Dual 5.3-inch AMOLED (1344x1892) with 8.3-inch full-screen mode (2688x1892) Refresh rate: 90Hz adaptive CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB | 256 GB | 512GB Rear camera: 12MP wide (f/1.7); 16MP ultrawide (f/2.2); 12MP telephoto (f/2.4)with 2x optical zoom Front camera: 12MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 4449 mAh Size: 5.7 x 3.6 x 0.43 inches (closed): 5.7 x 7.3 x 0.21 inches (open) Weight: 10 ouncesThe Microsoft Surface Duo 2 looks to right some of the original dual-screen device's wrongs by modernizing some of the phone's specs. Gone is the aging processor, replaced by a current Snapdragon 888. There's 5G connectivity, too, and multiple cameras this time around instead of a single lens that pulled double duty for both selfies and sweeping vistas.These changes at least get the Surface Duo 2 in the same ballpark as other flagships, though some of Microsoft's design decisions keep it from competing with the best foldable phones from Samsung. There's also the lingering debate over who actually needs a phone with expandable screens and whether Microsoft's approach is the way to go. This Microsoft Surface Duo 2 review looks at how this latest phone tackles those questions.The Microsoft Surface Duo 2 goes on sale Oct. 21, with a starting price of $1,499 for the 128GB model. Upgrading to 256GB of storage costs you an additional $100, and there's a $1,799 512GB version that's listed as out-of-stock at Microsoft as of this writing.To put the Surface Duo 2's price in context, it's $300 cheaper than the starting price of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, but $500 more than Samsung's other flip phone, the Galaxy Z Flip 3. The Flip was the first foldable phone to cost less than $1,000, and the Surface's price proves that dual- and flexible-screen devices remain a premium item.We haven't heard which phone carriers will be offering the Surface Duo 2, but we'll update this review with that information as it becomes available. The phone is available unlocked through both Amazon and Best Buy.Whatever misgivings people had about the specs on the original Surface Duo, there were few complaints about the build quality on that phone. So it's good to see that Microsoft isn't trying to reinvent the wheel (if wheels can unfold to reveal dual screens).Like its predecessor, the Surface Duo features two glass panels that come together on a pair of very sturdy hinges located at the top and bottom of the phone. Because the edges of the Surface Duo 2 are so smooth, opening the phone takes a little practice — I had my best success placing my thumbs on both side of the Duo and pulling apart — but once it's open, those hinges keep the screen in place. They're also flexible enough to keep the Surface Duo 2 open in different positions, including a tented view for watching videos and with the panels open a full 360 degrees so that they're lined up flat against each other.I tested the Obsidian version of the Surface Duo 2 and that black surface really picks up fingerprints, so keep a cloth handy. You can also get the Surface Duo 2 in Glacier.The front of the phone features a Microsoft logo. Because that's a simple square, I'll occasionally forget which side is up and try to open the Surface Duo from the wrong side. The back is smooth, too, save for a rather prominent camera bump.If the Surface Duo 2 has a design flaw, it may well be that bump which sticks out farther than most phones. When I try to slip the Surface Duo 2 into the pocket of my jeans, that camera bump usually gets caught, requiring me to do a little bit of wiggling to get everything to fit.Then again, the Surface Duo 2 isn't the sort of phone one easily slips into one's pants pocket. At 5.7 x 3.6 x 0.43 inches when closed, this device is meant to live in a coat pocket or a purse. Open the Surface Duo 2 up and the width expands to 7.3 inches while the phone itself is a mere 0.21 inches thin. If you've got the specs of the original Surface Duo handy, you'll notice that's a little thicker than before. There's no official explanation why, but the original phone was to thin to support NFC coils for tap-to-pay support, and this new version now offers that.Microsoft came up with a neat little trick for the hinge area when the Surface Duo 2 is closed. That's where Microsoft has put a glance bar that lights up when you've got incoming calls and text messages. My complaint here — the glance bar doesn't remain lit so if you weren't looking at your phone, you'll miss the notification. The glance bar also lights up as you charge the phone to show you what percentage of charge the Surface Duo has.Unlocking the phone is as easy as using the fingerprint reader embedded in the power button on the right side of the phone (the same panel that contains the camera array). I found the fingerprint reader to be fairly accurate and far enough removed from the volume rocker to avoid accidental touches.It's impossible to talk about the Surface Duo 2 without comparing it to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 3, currently the best foldable phone available. The two phones take different approaches — the Galaxy Z Fold 3 opens up to reveal a continuous 7.6-inch display while the Surface Duo 2 brings together to separate panels for an 8.3-inch work area. But both these devices are offering the same value proposition — get a tablet-sized screen in a device that's compact enough to carry around.Because the Surface Duo 2 offers more screen when opened, it's much wider than the Galaxy Z Fold 3. But Samsung's phone is taller and thicker, even when it's opened.As I've mentioned, the Surface Duo 2 is a dual screen phone so that 8.3-inch workspace is actually two separate 5.8-inch AMOLED panels each offering 1344 x 1892 resolution. When the phone's open, that resolution is boosted to 2688 x 1892.Both panels off 90Hz refresh rates, and while that's not the 120Hz variable refresh rate that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 boasts, it still means pretty smooth scrolling. The twin displays on the Surface Duo 2 are fairly bright, hitting 672 nits on a light meter. That outshines the 424-nit result from the Galaxy Z Fold 3's interior display, though it's not as bright as phones like the Galaxy S21 Ultra (821 nits) and the iPhone 13 Pro Max (1.038 nits when Adaptive Brightness is enabled).Colors felt a little muted when I watched the Dune trailer on YouTube until I cranked up the brightness. That's when the sands of Arakis took on more golden hue. Likewise, the Nightmare Before Christmas on Disney Plus benefitted from maxing out the display so that the creatures of Halloween Town weren't obscured by shadows.It was watching those videos that really cemented my chief gripe with the Surface Duo 2. You're really not watching videos on an 8.3-inch display. Rather, your best viewing experience comes when you watch a video on either one of the 5.8-inch panels, and that's not as expansive as you might think, particularly given the rather thick bezels surrounding the viewable area of the display.Oh, you can drag an app to the middle of the Surface Duo 2 and expand it into a full-screen mode that stretches across both panels. But there's a gap between the two screens, and while Microsoft says it's not as prominent as it was on the original Duo, that still means a long strip running through the middle of Jack Skellington's face that wouldn't be there on a more conventional display.Some apps, like YouTube, are optimized for the Surface Duo's 2 screens, though this means that the video appears on one panel while thumbnails of other videos appear on the other. Your best best for watch videos is to swivel the two screens into a tent mode and watch your program on one of the screens. Even then, the unconventional aspect ratio of the Surface Duo displays can lead to some odd stretching and cropping. A soccer match I streamed on Paramount Plus, for example, had its edges trimmed off when viewed in full-screen mode.If the Surface Duo 2 isn't ideal for watching videos or gaming — and it's not unless those apps have been optimized for a dual-screen device — then what is Microsoft's smartphone good for? The answer is the same as it was for the original Surface Duo — multitasking.The best use case for the Surface Duo is to run two apps side by side on each of the phone's panels. That way, you can keep a note-taking app open while researching topics in a mobile browser, or you can have a chat app while referencing a document from Microsoft's Office suite of apps.As before, the Surface Duo 2 supports app pairs, in which you can tie together two apps to launch at the same time when tapped. My Surface Duo review unit featured a pre-assembled pair of Microsoft OneNote and the Edge browser, but I was able to easily set up one of my own with Gmail and Chrome, just by pressing and holding one of the app icons and then selecting Group to pick its pair.App pairs should make it easy to jump into whatever work you need to perform on the Surface Duo 2, though the feature remains a bit glitchy. When I was using the phone for awhile and went to launch an app pair, sometimes the app tied to the left panel of the phone wouldn't appear, while the right panel did. The missing app would show up in the recently used apps tray, but not on the display itself. Quitting apps or restarting the phone would address the problem, but it seems like a pretty annoying glitch.You can access apps in full-screen mode by grabbing the bottom bar that you normally use to exit an app and dragging it over to the middle of the two screens. (If you want to switch which panel an app appears on, just keep dragging until the app shows up over there.) If the app hasn't been optimized, it will expand to fill up both screens, which gives you a bigger work area, albeit one with that aforementioned gap running down the middle where the two panels meet. I'll take the visible crease on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 over that, thank you very much.Fortunately, there are optimized apps for the Surface Duo 2 that take advantage of both panels simultaneously. In Teams — yes, Microsoft's video chat app has a prominent role on this phone — you can see a video of your fellow meeting participants on one screen and the presentation on the other. Editing photos from the Camera app puts the controls on a different screen from the image so that you can clearly see the changes as they're being made.Third-party apps have been optimized, too, and Microsoft includes a few bundled onto the Surface Duo 2. TikTok is present, with one screen showing videos in full screen mode while the other offers previews. Gameloft's optimized several games like Asphalt 9, which puts the controls on the bottom panel when you're holding the Surface Duo in portrait orientation. The experience is OK, through having the controls so removed from the game display takes a little getting used to.If there's an issue here, it's that there's no way of knowing which apps are optimized for the Surface Duo 2's screens and which ones aren't, short of dragging them to the middle of the device and finding out which ones open in both panels and which merely expand to fill up the entire 8.3-inch workspace.Your days of getting by with just a lone 11MP camera for all your photos as you had to on the Surface Duo are over. The Surface Duo 2 turns to a more conventional triple lens setup, with a 12MP wide camera serving as the main lens. To that, add a 16MP ultrawide angle shooter and a 12MP telephoto lens supporting a 2x zoom. Those aren't world-beating specs, but they at least allow the Surface Duo 2 to compete on more level footing with the best camera phones. In addition to the hardware changes, you get a dedicate night mode along with low-light and HDR multi-frame photo capture. In other words, Microsoft has put together a far more capable camera phone — at least on paper.The results in the real world look pretty good, too. While this shot of a fountain and the mosaic behind it is a little dark in the Surface Duo 2's rendering, it's a much better treatment than what the Galaxy Z Fold 3 produced, as Samsung's foldable phone over-exposed the scene. Other colors, like those ferns in the foreground are excessively brightened; the Surface Duo 2's shot tackles those plants with more realistic tones.Switching to the ultrawide angle lens on both phones to bring in more of the background, this time it's the Galaxy Z Fold 3 that makes the scene look a little dark than it was. As a result, the Surface Duo 2 makes those gray, brown and silver tiles look a lot more distinct and the shimmer in the blue tiles behind the sunflowers is more apparent.You can't really see it in this side-by-side comparison but the Galaxy Z Fold captured more of the surrounding scene — those lamps are almost completely contained in the Samsung picture, while the Surface Duo 2 cuts them out. That's because Samsung's phone offers a wider field of view on that particular camera — 123 degrees vs. 110 degrees on the Surface Duo 2.To test out the Surface Duo's zoom lens, I stood across the room and zoomed in at 2x on a bookshelf to see if the titles came through clearly. They really didn't — there's some noticeable distortion i you focus in on the book titles, and the entire image is pretty dark. Things look much brighter in the Galaxy Z Fold 3's shot, and text is crisp and legible.Indoors, we see how the phones approach the remnants of a pizza my daughter and her friend tore into. (The wine bottle in the background is mine, concerned onlookers.) The Surface Duo 2 produced more natural looking colors, but at the expensive of a rather dull looking image. In contrast the Galaxy Z Fold 3 cranked up the warmth — almost excessively so — but the pizza looks a little more appetizing in the latter shot.The Surface Duo 2's promised improvements in low-light photography don't really show up in this instance. Perhaps the orange lights illuminating the Halloween decorations on our porch overwhelmed the Surface Duo, but everything is bathed in that light. The Galaxy Z Fold 3's shot is more balanced, and although there's an orange tints from the lights, the skeletons and skulls don't look like they're coated in Tang.Turning to portrait mode, the Surface Duo 2 does a credible job with this picture of my daughter. The background blur is certainly stylish, though it did catch some of her shoulder on the right. But the picture is well lit even though we took it in a shadow. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 produced a much darker photo that washed out features like the freckles on my daughter's face.As for the Surface Duo 2's 12MP front camera, it didn't touch the beam of sunlight hitting my face as I snapped a selfie. The result is an interestingly lit shot that makes my face look a lot ruddier than it actually is. The colors on the Samsung photo are more balanced, even if you have the same problem with overly aggressive face-smoothing that we saw in portrait mode. (Note that this comparison uses the under-display camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which typically takes more disappointing shots in our experience.)Taken altogether, the photos produced by the Surface 2 Duo are fairly decent — nothing that will challenge the best camera phones, but certainly better than what the original Surface Duo produced with its only camera.When the original Surface Duo arrived, it featured a Snapdragon 855 system-on-chip at a time when other leading phones had already moved on to the Snapdragon 865. That meant a gap in performance between those phones and the Surface Duo — not an easy thing to swallow when you've paid four-figures for a phone.The Surface Duo 2 does not repeat that mistake. Microsoft has turned to the same Snapdragon 888 chipset found in the top Android devices, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Microsoft augments that silicon with 8GB of RAM.In terms of benchmarks, that translates to performance that's close to what you'd expect from phones with similar specs. On Geekbench 5, the Surface Duo 2 posted single- and multicore scores of 1,008 and 3,384, respectively. That's a little behind the 1,107 and 3,418 results we got with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, but it's not the sort of performance gap you're likely to notice. The same can't be said of the iPhone 13 Pro Max and its A15 Bionic chip, which blows away the competition with respective GeekBench scores of 1,720 and 4,549.The Surface Duo fared better in graphics testing, where it produced nearly 34 frames per second on the 3DMark Wild Life test. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 came in at 33 fps.Apps run smoothly on the Surface Duo 2 and graphics look sharp enough in demanding games like Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile. I did notice a slight lag when launch apps not stored in memory — particularly with app pairs when the first app would launch on the right screen and there would be a brief pause before the second app launched on the opposite panel.Using a top-of-the-line chipset does more than just improve the Surface Duo 2's performance relative to other Android devices. The Snapdragon 888 means there's 5G connectivity in this model, something the original Surface Duo lacked. Microsoft's spec sheet lists support for both mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G, so if you've got 5G coverage in your area, you should be able to connect to the faster networking standard.To handle those two screens and the power demands of 5G, Microsoft outfitted the Surface Duo 2 with a 4,449 mAh battery, quite the leap up from the 3,577 mAh power pack in the original Surface Duo. That didn't translate to much of an improvement in battery life when we put the Surface Duo 2 through our battery test, in which we have the phone surf the web continuously at 150 nits until it runs out of power.We first tested the Surface Duo 2 with only one of its screen active — the 9 hour and 47 minute result is just about average for a smartphone. Making both screens active reduced the phone's battery life to 7 hours and 38 minutes. That drop of just over two hours is consistent with how the original Surface Duo performed when we tested that phone.Anecdotally, the Surface Duo 2 packs enough power to get through most days, though particularly intensive rounds of testing caused the battery level to drop noticeably.While the Surface Duo 2 supports 23W charging speeds, Microsoft doesn't include a charger with the device — just a USB-C cable. I happened to have a 21W charger lying around, and that boosted the Surface Duo 2's battery from 76% to 82% after 15 minutes. That may not seem like much, but it can be useful for topping off the phone's battery in a pinch.The Surface Duo 2 runs on Android 11 — a significant decision by Microsoft, since it gives Surface Duo users access to the vast array of Android apps though the Play Store. But Android 12 is now out, and Microsoft is non-committal about when that update will come to its dual-screen device, saying only that it will work with Google on the issue.You can use Microsoft's $129 Surface Slim Pen 2 with the new Surface Duo for drawing in OneNote, diagramming things on the whiteboard in Teams and other sketching and note-taking tasks. I didn't find the pen to be an essential add-on for the phone, but if you do get it, you'll also want to pick up a $65 Surface Duo 2 Pen Cover, which attaches to your phone.With the Pen Cover, the Slim Pen 2 can magnetically attach to your phone while also charging so that your stylus will always be at the ready. Whether that's worth another $195 on top of the Surface Duo 2's price tag is another question altogether.To Microsoft's credit, the Surface Duo 2 addresses many of the complaints we had about the company's original dual-screen phone. The specs are more in line with the premium price, the cameras are much improved, and dual-screen multitasking is a definite productivity booster.But the reason people turn to bigger phones is for the expanded tablet-like work area. Because the Surface Duo 2 uses two separate displays, it really doesn't offer that experience; rather, it's just two 5.8-inch screens that are woking in tandem most of the time.For people who want to run apps side by side that will be enough to make the Surface Duo 2 an intriguing option. But if you're looking to lose yourself in the expansive flow of an uninterrupted screen, the Surface Duo just doesn't provide that — not with the approach Microsoft has taken."
9,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-z-flip-3,"Price: $999 (128GB), $1,049 (256GB)OS: Android 11 / One UI 3.1 Inner display: 6.7-inch Super AMOLED (2640 x 1080) Outer display: 1.9-inch Super AMOLED (260 x 512) Refresh rate: 120Hz (inner) CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 12MP (f/1.8) main, 12MP (f/2.2) ultrawide Front camera: 10MP (f/2.4) Battery: 3,300 mAhBattery life (Hrs:Mins): 5:43 (adaptive); 6:00 (60Hz) Charging: 15W wired, 10W wireless Charger included: No Size: 3.4 x 2.8 x 0.63-0.67 inches (closed); 6.5 x 2.8 x 0.27 inches (open) Weight: 6.5 ouncesThe Galaxy Z Flip 3 is here, and it’s the “cheapest” foldable phone yet at $999. No, a grand isn’t cheap, but the Galaxy Z Flip 3 brings foldable phone technology down to a much more attainable price. And more people can try out the foldable life than ever before.Will that lower price win people over to the foldable phone side? The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is also more durable than its predecessor, thanks to IPX8 water resistance. The screen is 80% more durable and the phone itself sports Gorilla Glass Victus on the outer display and Samsung’s new Armor Aluminum body. In short, the Z Flip 3 is built to withstand more punishment than the original Galaxy Z Flip, though we still wouldn’t drop it.If you're on the fence about which Samsung foldable to buy, I also encourage you to read our Galaxy Z Fold 3 review, too. And, our Galaxy Z Fold 3 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 3 comparison looks at how the two new foldables differ.Based on our testing, one area where the Galaxy Z Flip 3 majorly stumbles is battery life. It's not pretty. While the Flip 3 is a very good foldable phone for the most part, it's not quite great. Read on for our Galaxy Z Flip 3 review.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is available now for pre-order, with a shipping date of August 27. The 8GB/128GB base configuration runs $999, but there’s a 256GB option, too, for $1,049. Those who pre-order the Galaxy Z Flip 3 will get a $150 Samsung.com credit and 12 months of Samsung Care+ free with a three-year plan.Samsung also announced the Galaxy Z Flip 3 Bespoke Edition, which is a customizable phone for $1,099. You have 49 possible color combinations between the frame, front, and back. You can also subscribe to the Bespoke Upgrade Care plan, which lets you trade in your Flip 3 for a different color combination whenever you want. You also get a year of Samsung Care+. Just head over to the Bespoke Studio to get started.Samsung took durability seriously with the Galaxy Z Flip 3. The screen is now 80% more durable than the one found on the Galaxy Z Flip and Galaxy Z Flip 5G, thanks to a new film. Gorilla Glass Victus covers the 1.9-inch outer display and Samsung constructed the phone’s frame from its Armor Aluminum material. All of that provides enhanced scratch resistance, especially on the cover display.Combined with the enhanced durability, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is truly a marvel of modern engineering.The Flip 3 also sports IPX8 water resistance. That means you don’t need to worry about dunking it, though neither I nor Samsung would recommend that. We were not able to test the water resistance in our hands-on time with the phone.The cover display is probably the biggest change introduced to the Galaxy Z Flip 3’s design. That’s four times larger than the Galaxy Z Flip’s 1.1-inch exterior strip, meaning that you’ll see much more information than before. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 comes in four colors: Cream, Green, Lavender, and Phantom Black. The lavender really stood out to us in our hands-on, truly catching the eye and exemplifying the Flip 3’s focus on style. Samsung will also offer Gray, Pink, and White colorways exclusively on its website. I’m testing the Cream model and it’s very beautiful in its subtlety. The smooth finish is also really pleasing, considering how slippery the original Galaxy Z Flip was.Another big Galaxy Z Flip 3 upgrade involves the phone’s stereo speakers, which got loud enough that we had to turn down the volume in our hands-on session to avoid drowning out nearby conversations. Even when I was listening in on a Tom’s Guide meeting, the speakers still managed to impress me with their clarity. Suffice to say, the Flip 3’s sound system is much better than the original Flip’s.The main appeal of the Galaxy Z Flip 3 beyond its more attractive price remains how pocketable the device is when folded up. When closed, the phone is just 3.4 x 2.8 x 0.63-0.67 inches, meaning it can fit in almost any pocket.Opened up, the phone measures 6.5 x 2.8 x 0.27 inches, still making for a phone that fits easily in the hand. And at a mere 6.5 ounces (just like its predecessor), the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is easy to take with you anywhere. Overall, Samsung slimmed down the Flip 3 ever so slightly. The original Flip measured 6.6 x 2.9 x 0.28 inches when opened and 3.4 x 2.9 x 0.61-0.68 inches when closed. Although the new phone is the same weight, it’s a smidge thinner and taller. Combined with the enhanced durability, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is truly a marvel of modern engineering.When you unfold the handset, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 sports a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display. The 2640 x 1080 resolution combined with the 120Hz refresh rate made for a truly beautiful viewing experience. Scrolling was silky smooth with the Flip 3, showing off Samsung’s true display prowess.When closed, the 1.9-inch touchscreen lets you control music, check the weather, and even take selfies. (The touchscreen doubles as a viewfinder.) Simply double press the power button to launch the camera and you’re golden. This is a huge improvement over the Flip’s tiny outer display, making the Flip 3 more usable when it’s closed (and thus saving battery life, theoretically).Compared to the original Flip, I immediately loved the Flip 3’s new cover display. It’s incredibly versatile and useful, allowing you to interact with many major phone functions without opening the device up. By far, it’s my favorite Flip 3 feature outside of the folding itself.However, one thing that carried over from the original Flip is the crease across the middle of the interior display. It’s still quite noticeable when you scroll over it, even though you may not see it all the time. The image distortion is especially visible in direct sunlight or in apps that use light mode. The visible crease is by no means a deal-breaker, but if you were hoping for something more subtle this time around, you might be disappointed.The Galaxy Z Flip 3's inner displays reproduced 102% of the sRGB and 76.4% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts. That's actually less saturated than the iPhone 12 Pro's 115.6% sRGB rendering. However, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 has worse better color accuracy with a Delta-E score of 0.32 compared to the iPhone 12 Pro's 0.28. (0 is perfect in this test.)On the camera front, they’re unchanged from the original Flip. On the back, you get a 12MP (f/1.8) wide-angle shooter and a 12MP (f/2.2) ultrawide one. The selfie camera is 10MP with a f/2.4 aperture. And there is still no telephoto lens on the Galaxy Z Flip 3, unlike other $999 phones such as the iPhone 12 Pro — which I chose to use for the following photo comparisons.The Flip 3 has its work cut out for it if it’s going to go head-to-head with one of the best camera phones you can buy. And let's not forget that the Galaxy S21 has a telephoto lens and that Samsung works some impressive magic with its those lenses. The Galaxy Z Flip 3’s camera improvements come down to software, offering enhancements to portrait mode and indoor photography.Kicking things off is this photo of a copse of trees. Both shots are remarkably similar, but you can see hints of Samsung’s tendency to oversaturate colors in the Flip 3’s photo. The iPhone kept things more toned down. The resulting image isn’t as bright as the Flip 3’s, but its colors are more natural and accurate.To see how both phones handled direct sunlight, I took a picture of some flowers. This is where the Flip 3 noticeably struggled in comparison to the iPhone. The image looks overexposed, with some of the colors washed out. The iPhone 12 Pro handled the sunlight and colors better, lowering the exposure while showing off the flowers’ brightness.Heading inside, this photo of a Merida statuette was taken later in the day, so the room isn’t as bright. Even so, the Flip 3’s image is a bit darker than the iPhone’s. That picture looks a bit brighter compared to the dimmer Flip attempt. The iPhone’s shot has more vibrant colors than the Flip’s.For portraits, you can immediately see two different approaches. The Flip 3’s image is zoomed out more, adding in more of the background surrounding me, but I think I prefer the iPhone’s portrait. Its entire focus is on me and the background in secondary. I also like the iPhone’s stronger bokeh better, too. Samsung still has some work to do with its portrait mode.Taking a break from the iPhone 12 Pro comparisons for just a second, I brought out the Galaxy S21 Plus to test the Galaxy Z Flip 3’s zoom capabilities. The folding phone has a max digital zoom of 10x, whereas the S21 Plus can crank up to 30x. The S21 also has the Zoom Lock feature, which uses AI to stabilize the image. I’ll let the results speak for themselves on this one.Heading back over to the iPhone 12 Pro, here’s a shot at night of my smoker. Right off the bat, you can see the differences. While the Flip 3’s night shot isn’t bad, the iPhone’s is clearly better. Not only is the image brighter than the Flip 3’s, but it’s got more details, too. Samsung’s night mode has improved in recent years, but it still has a ways to go before it matches Apple’s.I tested the Galaxy Z Flip 3’s selfie capabilities using the front lens on the phone’s display. The differences here are more subtle than the other images we’ve looked at, but the Flip 3 applied some face smoothing to my face while the iPhone kept my ruddy complexion. The iPhone’s shot is also a bit warmer, which suited the miserably hot and bright day. I don’t dislike the Flip 3’s selfie, but I prefer the iPhone’s.Finally, here’s a selfie using the rear cameras with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 closed. Obviously, it’s a better image than the one from the internal front-facing camera, but even with the larger cover screen, lining up the shot properly takes a bit of practice. It’s really convenient, though.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 can record video at up to 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. The end result is crisp and smooth, and looks great. The iPhone 12 Pro is also able to record up to 4K 60 fps so I used both phones to record a brief walk to test stabilization, microphone quality, and overall visual fidelity.The Flip 3’s video is pretty close to the iPhone 12 Pro’s, which is one of the better options for shooting video. Colors in the Flip 3-shot footage  were accurate and vibrant, with excellent compensation for the bright daylight. Samsung did a great job with the Flip 3’s stabilization, but the iPhone had better mic quality and background noise isolation. That said, you won’t be disappointed with the Galaxy Z Flip 3’s video recording capabilities.With a Snapdragon 888 and 8GB of RAM, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a powerhouse. It didn’t stumble once as I flipped through apps in Flex mode. In short, the Flip 3 feels like any other Snapdragon 888-powered device.Intensive games like Genhin Impact and Asphalt 9 play beautifully on the Flip 3. I never noticed any frame drops. Games that support higher refresh rates like Dead Cells also play wonderfully on this phone. Of course, battery life is the only hindrance, which I'll get to in a second.In Geekbench 5, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 scored an impressive 2,984 in multicore. That's not too far off from the iPhone 12 Pro's 3,669. Geekbench isn't necessarily 100% indicative of real-world performance, but it gives an idea of what a system-on-chip like the Snapdragon 888 is capable of.In the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited graphics benchmark, the Flip 3 managed an average fps of 27.3. Compare that to the iPhone 12 Pro's whopping 51 fps average. Finally, in the Adobe Premiere Rush video test — where the phone must transcode a 4K video to 1080p — the Galaxy Z Flip 3 performed the test in 53 seconds. That's pretty good, but the iPhone 12 Pro did it in just 27 seconds.With a 3,300 mAh battery, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 retains the size of the original Flip’s battery capacity. This is cause for some concern, since the Flip’s battery life wasn’t all that impressive. 3,300 mAh is smaller than other Samsung phones, too, including the regular Galaxy S21 with its 4,000 mAh battery.We tested the Galaxy Z Flip 3's battery in both refresh rate modes and neither was a good result. In its adaptive mode, the Flip 3 lasted for just 5 hours and 43 minutes. In the 60Hz mode, it lasted for a slightly better 6 hours. I've also heard of other reviewers who got abysmally bad battery life, too. The Flip 3's poor battery life significantly detracts from the phone overall.The original Flip’s battery life lasted for a disappointing 8 hours and 16 minutes. Obviously, there’s not a lot of room for a big battery on the Galaxy Z Flip 3, but there’s now a larger outer display and a 120Hz refresh rate on the inner one, both of which draw more power than before.Another letdown with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the 15W max wired charging. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 supports up to 25W, so I expect charging your Flip will feel slow in comparison. Wireless charging on the Galaxy Z Flip 3 caps out at an even slower 10W.In our testing, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 recharged from 0% to 22% in 15 minutes, and to 44% in 30 minutes. That's not bad per se, but the battery is also smaller than many Android phones nowadays.As with the Galaxy S21 series, Samsung won’t be including a charger in the box. We’re not fans of this decision, either.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 comes with Android 11 and One UI 3.1 out of the box, with an Android 12 update on the horizon. As with other Samsung phones, you can expect three years of platform updates and four years of security patches with the Flip 3. Samsung’s update policy has paved the way for better support for Android phones, especially in the US where its presence is quite strong.You can refer to our previous coverage of Samsung devices for our thoughts on One UI 3.1, but it’s a very good rendition of Android. There are a ton of features and enough of Samsung’s design chops to help One UI stand out. In fact, it’s probably the de facto Android experience for many, many people.But the star of the show isn’t One UI itself, but the software enhancements that Samsung has slapped on to make the Galaxy Z Flip 3 feel useful. Key among those is Flex mode, which significantly bolsters the app user experience where supported. Flex mode allows you to split UI elements between the two displays. One of the best places to try this out is in the Camera app, where you can have the viewfinder on the top display and the shutter controls on the button. Similarly, you can video call with the phone folded at an angle and sitting on a table — that should help with arm fatigue on long video chats. One complaint with Flex mode on the Galaxy Z Flip was that there just weren’t that many apps that took advantage of it. YouTube was an exception, letting you watch the video on the top screen and scroll through comments on the bottom one. In fact, when asked, Samsung provided a paltry few apps that support Flex mode — most of the attention was seemingly on the Galaxy Z Fold 3's multi-screen capabilities. The Galaxy Z Flip 3 addresses a lot of our complaints with the original Galaxy Z Flip. Not only that, but the new phone is even cheaper than the 5G option Samsung released in 2020. A $999 starting price is very attractive to those who might’ve been on the fence about foldables before.That said, you can get a Galaxy S21 Plus for $999, which has a telephoto lens and better battery life. Furthermore, the Galaxy S21 is just $799 and it also has a telephoto lens. And the Galaxy S21 FE is likely coming soon, too, with an even lower price tag. Then there’s the $999 iPhone 12 Pro, which is one of the best phones around. In other words, the Flip 3 has a lot of competition and it fails to offer everything that its rivals can. Its terrible battery life certainly doesn't help things.But the Galaxy Z Flip 3 is meant to push things forward, offering something novel versus the glass and metal slabs we’re so used to nowadays. However, the Flip 3's extremely disappointing battery life gives us pause, making it difficult to recommend this phone in the end. You'll want to keep a charger or battery pack with you if you decide to go with the Galaxy Z Flip 3."
10,Samsung Galaxy S20 FE,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe,"The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE remains one of the better values in Android phones. For a reasonable $699, Samsung gives you a 120Hz display, 5G and triple cameras with 30x Space Zoom. That's $100 cheaper than the newer Samsung Galaxy S21. There have been rumors of a newer Galaxy S21 FE, but the phone doesn't appear to be launching anytime soon. Samsung clearly gears the Galaxy S20 FE toward younger shoppers. For one, the 32MP selfie camera is sharper than the front camera on the Galaxy S20. And you can get the S20 FE in six colors. But it's really for anyone who wants a great phone for an affordable price.Price: $699 Screen: 6.5-inch AMOLED (2400x1080: 120 Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 865 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB, expandable up to 1TB Rear cameras: Triple-lens: 12MP main (ƒ/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2), 8MP telephoto with 3x zoom (ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 32MP (ƒ/2.2) Battery size:  4,500 mAh Size: 6.29 x 2.93 x 0.33 inches Weight: 6.7 ouncesAs you might expect, Samsung had to cut corners in a few places to keep the price down, from the display resolution and RAM to the charger and plastic back. And the newer $799 Samsung Galaxy S21 offers faster performance, a dynamic 120Hz display and more advanced cameras.Based on my testing for this Galaxy S20 FE review, it remains one of the best phones for the money.The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE has a price of $699 and had a release date of Oct. 2, 2020. It comes in just one configuration, with 128GB of storage and 6GB of RAM, though owners can expand storage by up to 1TB with a microSD card.The Galaxy S20 FE is available through AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. The Verizon variant, dubbed Galaxy S20 FE 5G UW, supports the carrier's millimeter-wave 5G network for much faster speeds in urban areas. Some retailers already have the Galaxy S20 FE on sale for $599, or $100 off. And we've seen the Galaxy S20 FE for as low as $529. Check out the best Galaxy S20 FE deals so far.The Galaxy S20 FE will stand out in a crowd with its six color options. You can take your pick from Navy, Lavender, Mint, Red, White and Orange. We checked out the Navy option, which has a sophisticated sheen to it. Just note that the color selection will vary by carrier.Samsung makes a couple of design concessions in the name of affordability, but this phone doesn't look or feel cheap. The back uses polycarbonate (plastic) instead of glass, but Samsung did a nice job curving it around the sides to make the handset feel unified and solid.When you put the Galaxy S20 FE side by side with the regular Galaxy S20, it's easy to tell that the former has thicker bezels. However, once you start using the S20 FE it's fairly close to a full-screen experience. It also helps that the cutout from the S20 FE's front camera is smaller than on the regular S20. The Galaxy S20 FE doesn't cut corners when it comes to water resistance. The handset is IP68 rated, which means it can handle a dunk with ease.Measuring 6.29 x 2.93 x 0.33 inches and weighing 6.7 ounces, the Galaxy S20 FE is a bit thicker and heavier than the regular Galaxy S20 (5.9 x 3 x 0.31 inches, 5.7 ounces), but that's not a surprise given the FE has a larger display than the S20 (6.5 vs 6.2 inches).I do have one complaint about the Galaxy S20 FE's design, and it's the choice of fingerprint reader. Unlike the Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series, the S20 FE uses an optical sensor embedded in the display instead of a more accurate ultrasonic sensor. As a result, I encountered more false negatives trying to unlock the phone than I would like. I found that I had to be more deliberate when pressing down with this phone.I'm glad that the Galaxy S20 FE features a 120Hz display, which I think is a better feature to bring over from the regular Galaxy S20 than its sharper quad HD resolution. The S20 FE makes do with a full HD+ screen with 2400 x 1800 pixels.The 120Hz setting delivers smoother scrolling and better gameplay in a growing array of titles that support 120Hz panels. Thumbing through NYTimes.com was buttery smooth, and I enjoyed fluid animation when playing Marvel Contest of Champions as I used Iron Man to fire a laser at The Punisher.Samsung's OLED panel really shined when watching an episode of Cobra Kai. As Sam LaRusso crashed into a dessert table, the explosion of color really came through, with pops of green, blue, brown and orange.The Galaxy S20 FE's display performed well in our lab tests. It hit a peak of 679 nits of brightness with Adaptive brightness turned on. Anything above 600 nits is good, but the regular Galaxy S20 reached a max of 857 nits. This screen is also quite colorful, as the S20 FE registered 133.3% of the DCI-P3 color space, which is shy of the regular S20's 162.5%. In terms of color accuracy, the Galaxy S20 FE fared slightly better than the Galaxy S20, notching a score of 0.3; a score of zero is perfect. The regular S20 hit 0.37, and the iPhone 11 a better 0.22.The Galaxy S20 FE is one of the most versatile camera phones for the price, offering a trio of rear lenses, plus a front 32MP camera for selfies.The back cameras consist of a 12MP ultra-wide shooter with a f/2.2 aperture and 123-degree field of view. There's also a main 12MP camera (f/1.8) and a 8MP telephoto lens with a 3x optical zoom and 30x Space Zoom (digital).I had fun testing out the Space Zoom on the Manasquan River in New Jersey. I could zoom in on a boat from far away, and the Galaxy S20 FE got me in close enough to make out the two passengers and the sides of the vessel. It's definitely grainy up close but it's still pretty impressive for a phone.The Galaxy S20 FE also did a fine job capturing this close-up of a portulaca flower. The pink came out darker than real life, but I appreciated the level of detail in the water droplets around the petal.I compared the Galaxy S20 FE against the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro Max in this portrait, and Samsung's phone held its own. The S20 FE did a better job illuminating my face, even if it's a bit blown out. However, the water and surrounding trees look richer in the iPhone's shot, and the blur effect is a bit more subtle.The Galaxy S20 FE also performed well when I took several shots at a nearby park. When I shot a photo on a hiking trail, the S20 FE rendered the trees and leaves with pretty sharp detail, and the sunny sky didn't blow out the shot.I next challenged the Galaxy S20 FE with a shot of trees in a shadowy foreground, a rippling river in the center and a line of trees and puffy clouds in the background. Overall, the exposure looks pretty well balanced, and this is a pic I would be happy to share.The Galaxy S20 FE delivered a brighter photo of this tree in darkness with its Night mode. The lights on the right side are a little blown out, but overall you can make out more detail in the brick, trees and grass in Samsung's photo.The 32MP selfie camera on the Galaxy S20 FE gives you a normal and ultra-wide option for maximum flexibility, which comes in handy when you want to fit more people in the shot.Samsung says this selfie shooter uses what's called tetra binning (which combines four pixels into one to capture more light) and a re-mosaic algorithm (which remaps pixels into a conventional color patter for producing more detailed pics in bright conditions).In my testing I found that the Galaxy S20 FE had a tendency to smooth my face, though I'm not complaining too much. My blue shirt certainly pops and there's a fair amount of detail in my hair.I also tried out the Galaxy S20 FE's Super Steady mode, which is designed to minimized camera shake when you're in motion. I noticed only a slight difference with the setting on when walking at a moderate pace, so Super Steady is probably best for more rigorous activities and action sports. The Galaxy S20 FE packs a Snapdragon 865 processor and pairs that with 6GB of RAM, which is half as much as the 12GB in the regular Galaxy S20. You also get 128GB of storage, which is expandable up to 1TB via a microSD card.In my everyday use, I found the Galaxy S20 FE to be quite responsive, whether I was switching between a dozen open apps or racing around the track in Asphalt 9. I did notice a hint of lag when exiting to the home screen at times, but overall the S20 FE has performed well thus far. In Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the Galaxy S20 FE scored 2,928 in the multi-core test. That's lower than the Galaxy S20, which notched 3,147. The iPhone 11 reached a score of 3,251.On the GFXBench graphics test (Aztec Ruins Vulkan test off-screen), the Galaxy S20  FE reached 1,325 frames (21 frames per second).  The regular Galaxy S20 hit 1,319 and the iPhone 11 1,481.To test the Galaxy S20 FE's real-world performance, we transcoded a 4K video to 1080p after applying an effect and transition in Adobe Premiere Rush. The Galaxy S20 FE took 1 minute and 24 seconds, which is behind the regular S20's 1:15. The iPhone 11 took only 46 seconds.The Galaxy S20 FE should last you through most of your day on a charge, but it didn't last as long as we expected given the size of its battery. It's equipped with a 4,500 mAh battery, which is bigger than the 4,000 mAh pack in the Galaxy S20 and the same size as the Galaxy S20 Plus.After unplugging at 7 a.m. and using the Galaxy S20 FE regularly for several hours, it still had 55% juice left at 4:16 p.m, which is pretty good.However, on our web surfing battery test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness, the Galaxy S20 FE lasted only 8 hours and 58 minutes over AT&T's 5G network and 9:03 on Verizon's LTE network. (I don't have Verizon 5G in New Jersey). The handsets on our best phone battery life list all last 11 hours or more.By comparison, the regular Galaxy S20 lasted a slightly longer 9:31 over T-Mobile's network, and the iPhone 11 endured for a whopping 11:16. Note that these tests were run with the Galaxy S20 FE's display set to 60Hz; the 120Hz setting can reduce battery life by 2 or more hours based on our testing.The Galaxy S20 FE ships with a 15W charger, which is notably slower than the 25W charger that comes with the regular Galaxy S20. On our testing, the phone reached 16% charge in 15 minutes and 35% in 30 minutes. You can buy a 25W charger for faster charging with the FE, but it's going to cost you an additional $29.While the competition is heating up for flagship phones that cost less than $700, the Galaxy S20 FE remains be tough to beat. It offers a big display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, strong cameras and solid performance in a colorful design. I can deal with the plastic back and most other trade-off; I just wish Samsung included a more advanced ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and the battery life was a bit longer.The Galaxy S20 FE's powerful zoom, in particular, help Samsung stand out against the likes of the Google Pixel 5 and iPhone 12. The Pixel 5 offers better photo quality, but its performance trails the S20 FE. And while the iPhone 12 is faster than the S20 and also delivers better looking photos, it doesn't last as long on a charge and lacks a telephoto zoom. (We go into greater depth on the differences in our Samsung Galaxy S20 FE vs. iPhone 12 face-off.)Some may prefer the Samsung Galaxy S21, which costs $100 more than the Galaxy S20 FE. The Galaxy S21 offers a faster Snapdragon 888 chip, better image processing with its cameras and a sleeker design. Samsung is reportedly working on a Galaxy S21 FE model with a faster processor and other upgrades, but it likely won't launch until later. Overall, the Galaxy S20 FE is still one of the best phones for the money."
11,Apple iPhone 13,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-13,"The iPhone 13 (from $799) doesn’t seem very new when you first look at it. But when you start using this flagship, you realize that it delivers a lot more than a smaller notch. The new iPhone’s display is brighter than its predecessor’s. The battery life is longer. And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro (even on a non-Pro phone).Yes, the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land. But it’s more about what this chip lets you do. This includes Cinematic mode, which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus, and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.Check out our iPhone 13 mini review if you want all the same features of the iPhone 13 in a smaller design. Want a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom? See our iPhone 13 Pro review. And our iPhone 13 Pro Max review is the place to go if you want the biggest screen.Of course, if you decide you want to wait another year for the iPhone 14 before upgrading from your current Apple phone, then check out the seven biggest upgrades we want to see from the iPhone 14. Available right now, the iPhone 13 starts at $799 for 128GB of storage (up from a meager 64GB on the iPhone 12), and that goes up to $899 for 256GB and $1,099 for 512GB. In the U.K. the entry-level model starts at £779, with the 256GB handset coming ins at £879, and the 512GB model hitting £1,079. These are hardly cheap phones but you can save with trade-in offers from Apple as well as from wireless carriers, and there are plenty of discounts available. Do make sure to check out our iPhone 13 deals page for the latest offers. Also be aware that some iPhone 13 orders have annoying delays — but Apple is working on it.There’s really two design changes of note for the iPhone 13. First, the cameras on the rear are now arranged diagonally instead of vertically.Second — and more importantly — the notch is now 20% smaller while still delivering the same great TrueDepth camera system and Face ID you’d expect since the iPhone X ushered in this feature four years ago.Honestly, the smaller notch doesn’t make much of a difference in day-to-day use of the iPhone 13. When watching videos in landscape mode side by side at full-screen, I didn’t find either notch that distracting.I did appreciate the mini notch more when using apps with a white background in portrait orientation, such as Gmail. However, the notch on the iPhone 13 mini swoops down a bit more despite being narrower.The button placement is slightly different on the iPhone 13 versus the iPhone 12. The power button is lower on the right side, and the same thing goes with the ringer switch and volume buttons on the left side.Otherwise, the iPhone 13 offers the same tough CeramicShield display up front, durable glass back and flat edges. And you get the same IP68 water resistance as before. Unfortunately, the iPhone 13 doesn’t offer Touch ID, an upgrade many of us would have appreciated since Face ID doesn’t work well with masks. I didn’t need a sensor in the display like many Android phones now support; a Touch ID sensor embedded in the power button like on the iPad mini 6 would have been fine. For now, it appears the iPhone 13 is having a problem unlocking with the Apple Watch in some cases. Apple has acknowledged the issue and says a fix is coming soon. The iPhone 13 comes in five colors, including Pink, Blue, Midnight, Starlight and (Product) Red. I tested the blue model, which is a fun shade without being too loud. And I continue to appreciate the color-matched aluminum frame Apple includes with its entry-level iPhones.Alas, the iPhone 13 doesn’t boast the adaptive 120Hz refresh rate of the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s still a stellar OLED panel. This Super Retina XDR display is now 28% brighter than the iPhone 12; it’s also rated at 800 nits, compared to 600 nits for last year’s phone.In my testing, I wouldn’t say the brightness difference is dramatic, but it can help when you’re trying to view the iPhone 13’s display in direct sunlight.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.On our lab tests, the iPhone 13 averaged 795 nits of brightness, compared to 569 nits for the iPhone 12 and 702 nits for the Galaxy S21. The iPhone 13 also registered 78.1% of the DCI-P3 color gamut and 110.2% of the sRGG color gamut, where higher numbers are better. The iPhone 12 hit 81.1 and 114.5 and the Galaxy S21 77.4 and 109.2. The iPhone 13 panel’s color accuracy is stellar, too, as it achieved a Delta-E score of 0.26 (lower is better.) That compares to 0.29 for both the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12.There’s much more to the iPhone 13 cameras than just a new diagonal arrangement of the lenses. The wide camera now gathers 47% more light than the iPhone 12, thanks to a larger camera with 1.7μm pixels.Another plus is that the ultrawide camera can now capture four times more scene and its newer sensor delivers better low-light performance along with less noise.   If you’re not a fan of the iPhone’s usual color temperature — or you just wanted more control over your photos — you’ll appreciate the Photographic Styles feature. In the Camera app, you can switch from multiple styles, including standard, vibrant, rich contrast, warm and cool.I tried out the feature with a series of portraits, and I appreciated the difference between styles. For example, the rich contrast mode made the shot look less hazy, while the vibrant setting made the coleus plants pop more along with the tree in the background. It’s not that easy to switch this effect on the fly, as you have to tap a setting and then select the style you want, but I like that you can customize your own styles. In this photo taken at the Manasquan reservoir in New Jersey, you can see how superior the iPhone 13’s camera is compared to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. The water looks more vibrant and translucent, and the iPhone 13 does a better job rendering the shadows around the wood. The iPhone 13 also delivered a better looking shot of these Halloween decorations. The orange pumpkin sign looks more vibrant and brighter, as do the surrounding real-life pumpkins. The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s pic is plenty sharp but looks a bit flat.In many shooting situations, the iPhone 13 was on par with the iPhone 12, but I did notice a marked improvement in Night mode. While the result is a bit on the fuzzy side, the iPhone 13 captures a brighter pink in the hydrangea flowers and the surrounding leaves are brighter.The iPhone 13 is the rare smartphone that can make you feel like a director as you shoot videos. And that’s thanks to a new feature called Cinematic mode. This effect brings depth of field to your footage and automatically changes the focus to various subjects depending on what’s happening in the frame, such as someone turning their head to talk to another person. You don’t have to lift a finger and it works (almost) like magic.When shooting my three dogs playing with my daughter, I was really impressed when the iPhone 13 placed the focus on the pup that was closest to me at first, and as he left the frame my daughter and older golden retriever automatically came into focus. The bokeh effect on the background is something other smartphone makers have attempted, including Samsung, but the Galaxy S21 Ultra isn’t smart enough to switch the focus from subject to subject in real time.Cinematic mode isn’t perfect, as the iPhone 13 sometimes took a second to recognize faster moving subjects (our younger golden retriever). A bigger drawback is that this mode is capped at 1080p, as you can’t record Cinematic mode in 4K. But overall, it’s a cool feature I think a lot of people will want to try, especially for social videos on TikTok.The overall video quality from the iPhone 13 is stellar, with improved noise reduction, better dynamic range and enhanced semantic rendering that can identify skin, faces, the sky and more. As I swept around the Manasquan reservoir with the iPhone 13 and iPhone 12, I especially noticed less noise in the blowing leaves from the iPhone 13’s footage. And in a separate 4K clip, I got lost in the gentle waves lapping against the sand.The A15 Bionic doesn’t offer dramatic performance gains over the A14 Bionic powering the iPhone 12, but it didn’t need to just to remain the fastest chip in any phone. As with the A14 Bionic, the A15 offers a 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU, but there’s now a 16-core Neural Engine for machine learning and AI, up from 8 cores on the previous chipset.Apple says that the iPhone 13’s CPU is up to 50% faster than the competition while the GPU can handle graphics rendering 20% faster. Before we get into the benchmarks, I think it’s important to talk about how swift this phone feels in everyday use. In a game like Genshin Impact — an open-world adventure combat title — the animations and particle effects felt console-quality as I climbed mountains, explored sweeping landscapes and tried to battle enemies. I was equally impressed by the Seek app, which instantly identified plants when I pointed the camera around my backyard. On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the iPhone 13 scored 4,129 and 1,684 respectively. That’s considerably better than the 3,859/1,593 turned in by the iPhone 12, and it destroys the Galaxy S21’s scores of 3,302/1,048. The iPhone 13’s graphics performance also impresses. On the 3DMark Wild Life benchmark, the new iPhone hit 55.9 frames per second. That’s just a bit higher than the iPhone 12 (51 fps), but the Galaxy S21 Ultra mustered only 33 fps.We didn’t see much of an improvement on our video editing test using Adobe Premiere Rush. The iPhone 13 took 25.9 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p compared to 26.5 seconds for the iPhone 12. The Galaxy S21 took 1 minute and 2 seconds.Check out our iPhone 13 benchmarks results page to see how all four models perform and how they compared to the Android competition. Apple says that the iPhone 13 lasts up to 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12, thanks to a bigger battery, more efficient display and the A15 Bionic chip. But our testing showed even better results.On the Tom’s Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over 5G at 150 nits of screen brightness over cellular (AT&T’s network in this case), the iPhone 13 endured for 10 hours and 33 minutes. That’s more than 2 hours longer than the 8:25 time that the iPhone 12 turned in. The best result we saw from the Galaxy S21 was 9:53.To see how all four iPhone 13 models fared, check out our iPhone 13 battery life results summary, which includes comparisons with more Android phones. Unfortunately, the iPhone 13 offers the same charging speeds as before. The new iPhone got to 51% capacity in 30 minutes with Apple’s 20W charger. Other phones on our fastest charging phones list are much speedier, such as the OnePlus 9 Pro. The iPhone’s 15W MagSafe charger is a bit slower, but some may find it more convenient because it’s magnetic and doesn’t involve the Lighting port.iOS 15 delivers some welcome improvements to your iPhone, many of which focus on shared experiences. FaceTime has improved audio and a cleaner interface, and a future update will let you listen to music or watch movies or TV shows with friends or family. And the Messages app delivers a new Shared with You section for photos, articles and more to make it easier to keep track of all the different links friends text your way.I personally appreciate the new Focus feature in iOS 15, which lets you filter notifications based on what you’re doing. And notifications themselves have been refined, complete with a new summary view so you don’t get overwhelmed by constant alerts.Other iOS 15 highlights include a redesigned Safari (I actually don’t like the address bar at the bottom, but Apple lets you change the location), a more full-featured Weather app and an enhanced Maps app with more detail and better road views. Last but not least, Live Text bites off Google Lens by recognizing text in real time via the camera when you want to look things up or get translations.Thus far iPhone 13 owners have encountered a few problems. For example, some iPhone 13 users are finding that the phone won't unlock with an Apple Watch, though a fix apparently is on the way. In addition, some iPhone 13 owners are complaining about the touch display not being responsive enough in some cases, which could be an iOS 15 issue. On the iPhone 13 Pros, there are complaints that the cameras are automatically switching between lenses without warning, and Apple will be rolling out an update that will enable users to turn this off. And the ProMotion displays on the iPhone 13 Pros are not running at 120Hz with some apps, which Apple will be addressing in an update. And developers need to optimize their apps as well. See our iPhone 13 problems roundup for more info. The closest Android has to an iPhone is Google's Pixel line, which is due for a refresh right about now. While the Pixel phones don't sell in numbers that even give the iPhone 13 pause, they do offer serious competition when it comes to cameras. Google and Apple trade blows on who has the best camera phone and this year is set to be a major battle.With Google taking a page from Apple's playbook and going with its own silicon (named Tensor), we could see the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have some incredible AI and machine learning capabilities. We're still waiting to get our hands on the Pixel 6, but rest assured that we'll be putting it through its paces to see how it compares to the iPhone 13.The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks. I’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on a par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do."
12,Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-pros-and-cons,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (from $1,299) is still the phone to get if you want a handset with a stylus, especially since Samsung has confirmed that a Galaxy Note 21 isn't happening this year. So is the Note 20 Ultra worth the ultra-premium price? After thoroughly testing this big-screen phone, I'd say the answer is yes — if you can appreciate all the bells and whistles. Price: $1,299 OS: Android 10 with One UI 2.0 Display: 6.9-inch AMOLED (QHD; 120Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 865 Plus RAM: 12GB Storage: 128GB, 512GB Rear camera: 108MP wide (ƒ/1.8); 12MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom (ƒ/3.0); 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2) Front camera: 10MP (ƒ/2.2) Battery: 4,500 mAh Battery life: 10 hrs 26 min (7:59, 120Hz mode) Colors: Mystic Bronze, Mystic Black, Mystic White Size: 6.48 x 3.04 x 0.32 inches Weight: 7.33 ouncesThe Galaxy Note 20 Ultra boasts a huge 6.9-inch display with a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate, a sharp 108MP camera with laser auto focus and a more responsive S Pen. The regular Galaxy Note 20 is the better option for those who can live without a 120Hz display and and more advanced cameras.The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the better phone overall, as it offers more advanced cameras and a faster Snapdragon 888 chip. And some may want to wait for the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which is tipped to an include an S Pen holster along with other upgrades.However, as you'll see in my full Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review, this is still an excellent device.The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra had a release date of August 21, 2020, and is  available through all of the major carriers. The 128GB version of the Galaxy Note 20 costs $1,299. The 512GB version costs $1,449 — the same price Samsung charges for its Galaxy Z Flip 5G foldable phone. Note that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra often goes on sale, and we've seen it for as low as $1,049 on Best Buy with activation. Samsung has made its most elegant looking phone yet with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. The squared off edges combined with the sophisticated Mystic Bronze color give this handset a corner office vibe.I also like that the finish does a good job resisting fingerprints, unlike the Aura Glow finish on the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. You can also get the Note 20 Ultra is Mystic Black and Mystic White.There’s a couple things I don’t like about the design. One, the camera patch on the back is big and bulky, which not only reminds me of brass knuckles — it props up the entire phone. You can hear the phone wobble when you press down on the top of the display.And while the curved display is sexy, it can sometimes cause accidental taps when you’re just holding the phone. In some cases my screen taps did not register, as I didn't realize my other hand holding the phablet was interfering.Measuring 6.49 x 3.03 x 0.32 inches (164.8 x 77.2 x 8.1 mm) and weighing 7..3 ounces (208 grams), the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is not as big as the Galaxy S20 Ultra (6.6 x 2.7 x 0.34 inches and 7.7 ounces), but it’s still a handful compared to the Galaxy Note 10 Plus (6.4 x 3 x 0.31 inches and 6.9 ounces) which had a smaller 6.8-inch display. There have been some complaints from Galaxy Note 20 Ultra owners that the camera housing has been collecting dust and condensation underneath the glass. However, our review unit has not exhibited this issue. Overall, despite some minor complaints the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra really does look and feel like a $1,300 handset.The massive 6.9-inch OLED quad HD+ display on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is big, bold and colorful. More important, this is the first Samsung phone to offer a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate. The Galaxy S20 lineup introduced a faster refresh rate to Samsung phones, delivering smoother scrolling as well as better visuals, especially for games and movies. But it was a feature you had to manually adjust. With the Note 20 Ultra, the refresh rate automatically adjusts based on what content is on screen, which should save on battery life. When using the display I found scrolling to be super smooth and fast in Chrome with Adaptive mode turned on. You can always choose 60Hz manually if you want to save every last drop of juice.I also tried the Dead Trigger 2 games, which is one of the titles optimized for the 120Hz panel. As I ran around shooting zombies and navigating dark corridors the game looked smooth and felt extremely responsive.The Note 20 Ultra's panel is exceedingly bright and is fairly easy to read in direct sunlight. The display hit a fairly high 662 nits on our light meter, which is very good but not as high as the iPhone 11 Pro's 752 nits. The Note 20 Ultra's screen produced 121.5% of the sRGB color gamut in Natural Mode and 201.2% in Vivid mode, compared to 118.6% for the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The Note 20 Ultra beats Apple on accuracy, registering a Delta-E score of 0.24, compared to 0.28 for the iPhone 11 Pro Max (where 0 is perfect).Some Galaxy Note 20 Ultra owners are complaining that a green tint is appearing on the screen when the brightness is lowered. We have not experienced this issue on our review unit. We reached out to Samsung but they do not have any comment at this time.The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra features a trio of rear cameras, plus a laser auto-focus sensor that should address one of our bigger complaints about the Galaxy S20 Ultra and its issues with focus.The phablet's camera array starts with a 108MP wide camera with a a f/1.8 aperture, and it’s paired with a 12MP ultra-wide camera with a 120-degree field of view and f/2.2. The 12MP telephoto lens delivers a 5x optical zoom and up to a 50x super resolution zoom. I tired out the powerful Space Zoom on the Note 20 Ultra with this tree as the subject. As you can see in the gallery below, the results look fairly sharp all the way up to 10x zoom, but the 20x and especially the 50x shots look blurry. Still, this is better than what you get from the iPhone right now.The 108MP camera option may seem like overkill, but it can come in handy when you want to have the freedom to crop way into a photo after the fact. Just make sure you have enough ambient light, as this setting is best used outdoors.As you can see in this photo of Halloween decorations, I could crop in on just a few of the straw the people, a ghost and witch, and you can still make out plenty of detail. There's just a bit of noise in the frame.The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra's Night Mode is good but it's not quite as bright or colorful as what the iPhone 11 Pro could muster. You can see the difference in this photo of a fruit basket taken in almost complete darkness. You can make out more of the lemons and Apples, as well as the basket itself.The Note 20 Ultra delivered better results than the iPhone 11 Pro in this close-up of a flower.  The Note 20 Ultra's shot is closer to reality as the petals look more red than violet and the white balance is better. However, the iPhone's shot blurs out less of the background.The Note 20 Ultra did a fairly good job with portraits, but Samsung's tendency to slightly wash out faces is prevalent here, and you can see that it had a bit of trouble with the sunlight on my arm. The iPhone 11 Pro Max's portrait is more pleasing and make me pop more against the background, even if the pic is overly warm. Where the Note 20 really beats the iPhone is with its zoom. In this 10x zoom of a tree straddling a creek, you can make out more detail in the bark and surrounding leaves. The only bummer is that Samsung blows out some of the highlights. The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra's camera turns out to be a formidable cooking partner. It managed to capture the juice on top of this steak while grilling and the flames below while keeping everything in focus. If you want to record the sharpest video possible, you’ll be pleased to know that the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can record 8K video with a 21:9 aspect ratio at up to 24 frames per second. There’s also a new Pro Video mode that lets you control the focus, exposure and zoom speed. Plus, you can use the onboard mics or external mics, such as the Galaxy Buds Live.The 12MP selfie camera up front (f/2.2) has a 120-degree field of view, which should come in handy for group selfies. in this selfie, the Note 20 Ultra did a great job capturing the lush green background at a nearby park, and the blue in my shirt really pops. However, my face looks a bit too smooth and a little washed out.The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra benefits from a swift 9ms response time for its S Pen, which is designed to deliver more of a pen-to-paper feel when taking notes or drawing.In addition, the S Pen now offers five new Anywhere actions, which build on the Air Actions from the Galaxy Note 10 series. You can return to the home screen, take a screen shot, return to a recent app and more through various gestures. But it will take some practice before you can remember every gesture-based Anywhere action.Other S Pen upgrades come on the software front. The improved Samsung Notes app now includes Live Sync so you can save all of your notes to the clouds and then access them from any device.Plus, the Note 20 Ultra is smart enough to time sync your notes along with voice recordings, so you can hear what was being said right when you scribbled down that thought. I tried recording a voice memo in the Samsung Notes app, and sure enough, I could see the words I wrote highlighted as I played back the clip. In addition, the Samsung Notes app now makes it easier to find your notes with a more PC-like file folder structure. The software can even straighten out your handwriting. The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is one of the fastest Android phones around, as it’s one of the first handsets with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 Plus processor. This chipset boosts the clock speed by 10% up to 3.1 GHz and the graphics is also 10% faster than the regular Snapdragon 865 chip inside the Galaxy S20.This processor is paired with 12GB of RAM and either 128GB or 512GB of internal storage. For $1,299, I wish the Ultra started with 256GB of storage, but at least you can expand it via microSD card slot by up to 1TB.I handed the Note 20 Ultra to our resident Fortnite expert, my 12-year-old son, and he found the gameplay to be so smooth that I had to lobby hard to get the phone back. On Geekbench, which measures overall performance, the Note 20 Ultra hit a multi-core score of 3,294, which is ahead of most Android phones but behind the Asus ROG Phone 3 with the same Snapdragon 865 Plus chip, which notched 3,393. The iPhone 11 Pro scored an even higher 3,500.The Note 20 Ultra also trailed the iPhone on our video editing test, taking took 1 minute and 16 seconds to the iPhone’s 45 seconds.On the GFXBench graphics test, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra scored 1,455 frames on the Aztec Ruins (High Tier) off-screen benchmark, compared to 1,657 frames for the iPhone 11 Pro.As you would expect for a premium flagship, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra supports both flavors of 5G, so you should be able to hop on both sub 6-GHz networks and mmWave networks with ease where they are available.In New Jersey I saw decent download speeds on T-Mobile's 5G network, ranging between 40 Mbps and 99 Mbps. But it was not exactly blazing. Uploads ranged between 10 and 35 Mbps.Some reviewers have complained that the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can run a little hot. A Note 20 Ultra teardown has revealed that the phone uses a multi-layered graphite thermal pad to aid with heat dissipation instead of the copper pipe and vapor chamber system used in the Galaxy S20 Ultra. However, we have not experienced any heat issues.The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is geared toward power users who are looking for a productivity boost, and this phone offers a couple of big upgrades on that front. Multitaskers will also appreciate the improved DeX experience, which is now completely wireless, instead of requiring you to use a cable or dock to connect to a monitor. Now you can beam what’s on your Galaxy Note 20 Ultra screen to a compatible smart TV from across the room; the TV needs to support Miracast, though.After some tinkering I was able to get the Wireless DeX mode to work on my 55-inch TCL Roku TV. After connecting to the TV I could use the Note 20 Ultra's screen as a touchpad to move the cursor around the display. Although the movement was a bit jerky, I enjoyed being able to pull up pics from the Google Photos app and show them on the big screen. I also tried streaming the Asphalt 9 racing game to the TV, but the gameplay stuttered. The Note 20 Ultra delivered better performance when playing Fortnite; using a PS4 controller my 12-year-old son was able to play a match and make a couple of kills with not too much lag.Another key upgrade is Link to Windows integration, which allows you to access mobile apps on your Windows 10 PC via the Your Phone app. I was able to send and receive messages, make calls, and see my notifications on a Galaxy Tab S laptop. I also could scroll through my photo gallery.The fun really starts when you start running Android apps on your laptop. I tried a few games, including Asphalt 9, which ran smoother here than it did over DeX mode. The keyboard controls actually worked well, though you can also use your laptop's touchscreen.Some apps ran at full screen, but the Skyforce shooting game stayed in a small window. Samsung says that Link to Windows will eventually let you run up to six mobile apps on your PC at once.Last but not least, you can mirror the Galaxy Note 20's interface directly on your Windows laptop and run apps from there. I had no problem firing up Twitter and scrolling through my feed. You can't do this with an iPhone.Through the power of Microsoft’s xCloud game streaming, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra can play more than 100 Xbox games via Xbox Game Pass (currently in beta). Titles include Gears 5, Forza Horizon 4, Minecraft Dungeons and Halo: The Master Chief collection. I tried a few rounds of Forza, and the gampplay was surprisingly fluid using a PS4 controller, despite the fact I was streaming over the cloud. The only bummer was having to wait a while for each game to load; however, this time could be less once Xbox Game Pass is out of Xbox Game Pass costs $15 a month, and when you pair the Note 20 Ultra with a game controller it could feel like a mini console. (Those who pre-order the Note 20 Ultra can get a three-month free trial.) The fun gets underway September 15 when the service officially kicks off, so we'll report back with final impressions. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra packs a pretty beefy 4,500 mAh battery, which held up well in daily use.After unplugging at 9 am I used the Note 20 Ultra with a wide range of apps. I watched over an hour of Umbrella Academy on Netflix, streamed Spotify with the screen on for an hour and a half and played about 40 minutes of Fortnite. I also used Twitter for nearly an hour, surfed the web and checked email.After all that I still had about 27% juice left at 9 pm. That's not bad. The Note 20 Ultra endured for 10 hours and 26 minutes on the Tom's Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness over 5G. In this case we used T-Mobile's network. This was with 60Hz screen mode on. The device lasted just 7:59 with the 120Hz screen mode turned on.By comparison, the Galaxy S20 Plus with its 4,500 mAh battery lasted 10 hours and 31 minutes and 8:55 in 120Hz mode. And the OnePlus 8 Pro lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes in 60Hz mode and 9:02 in 120Hz mode. The handsets on our best phone battery life list all last over 10 hours. The Note 20 Ultra comes with a 25-watt charger, which juiced the device to 56% in 30 minutes. That’s good, but it’s not as fast as the OnePlus 8 Pro’s 63% in the same amount of time.The Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is nearly the pinnacle of Android phablets — and it should be for $1,299. It offers a best-in-class display, a better S Pen experience and a boatload of features for work and play. The cameras are very good, fixing the focusing problem with the Galaxy S20 Ultra, and the powerful zoom and Xbox gameplay give the Note 20 Ultra a couple of advantages over the iPhone 12 Pro Max.The iPhone 12 Pro Max is the superior camera phone based on our testing, as it includes a bigger main sensor that lets in more light, a LiDAR sensor that speeds up autofocus and Dolby Vision video recording and editing. And the new iPhone boats a tougher Ceramic Shield display. But it lacks the Note 20 Ultra's 120Hz display and S Pen support.Some may prefer the newer Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra for $1,199. It delivers a faster processor, even better cameras and optional S Pen support. But if you really want the stylus built in I'd go with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, especially since a Galaxy Note 21 reportedly isn't coming this year."
13,Motorola Edge 5G UW,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-edge-5g-uw,"Starting price: $549 Screen size: 6.8-inch FHD+ resolution Maximum refresh rate: 144Hz CPU: Snapdragon 778G RAM: 6GB | 8GB (unlocked) Storage: 128GB | 256GB (unlocked) Rear cameras: 108MP main (f/1.9); 8MP ultrawide (f/2.2); 2MP depth sensor Front camera: 32MP (f/2.25) Battery size: 5,000 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 11:38 (60Hz); 9:23 (144Hz) Size: 6.7 x 3 x 0.35 inches Weight: 7.1 ouncesThe Motorola Edge 5G UW faces the same dilemma as last year's Motorola Edge — how to stand out from a sea of similarly priced phones. Motorola takes on this task by making some key improvements to the latest Motorola Edge — the main camera packs more resolution, the screen refreshes at a faster rate, and the phone charges faster than before — while keeping the price competitive.Those kind of improvements generally help a phone break through a crowded field of options, and our Motorola Edge 5G UW review finds a device that's much improved over last year's model. You'll still have to overlook some particular quirks with the latest Motorola Edge, but otherwise, this is a solid rival to other top midrange models and a decent alternative to higher-priced flagships.We're reviewing the Motorola 5G UW, a $549 phone with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage that's available through Verizon and works with that carrier's high-speed Ultra Wideband 5G network. You can buy the phone in 30 monthly installments of $18.33. Verizon is also offering the Motorola Edge 5G as a free device (via monthly credits on your bill) when you sign up for a select unlimited plan.If you're not enamored with the idea of Verizon as your carrier, there's an unlocked version of Motorola Edge (2021) with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM available at a regular price of $699. This version lacks the Ultra Wideband connectivity, but it will work with other 5G networks; otherwise, there's no difference between these two Motorola Edge (2021) models.To put the Motorola's phone price in context, Apple's iPhone 13 mini costs $699 while Samsung's Galaxy S20 FE has fallen to $599. The midrange Galaxy A52 5G costs $499, so the Motorola Edge 5G UW falls squarely between a lower-end flagship and an upper-midrange model.With its Nebula Blue back panel shimmering in the light, the Motorola Edge 5G UW looks deceptively fancy, especially when the light catches the back of the phone and reflects on the 6.7 x 3 x 0.35-inch device. But once you pick up the Edge, you know why it costs less than the premium phones it tries to emulate — that's a plastic back meant to evoke fancier phones. The Motorola Edge can pick up fingerprints through regular use, though I've used phones in this price range that have done a worse job at hiding smudges.The Motorola Edge houses its fingerprint sensor on the side power button, which is responsive enough when it comes to unlocking the phone. If I have any objections, it's that the power button is built a little too subtly into the right side of the phone, so that it can take some time sliding your finger up and down the side to find it. The power button is also pretty close to the volume toggle, so you could wind up adjusting volume when all you want to do is unlock your phone.This is a fairly large phone so that it can accommodate the Motorola Edge's 6.8-inch display. Unlike the edge-to-edge screens in vogue these days, there's a noticeable bezel at the bottom of the Edge's LCD panel, presumably to house the phone's speaker. With a punch-hole cut-out at the center of the display, don't expect a lot of encumbered screen real estate, despite the Motorola Edge's size.On the back of the phone, the three rear lenses on the Motorola Edge jut out, with multiple layers on the camera array itself. The end result is that the Motorola Edge 5G UW doesn't lay flat on its back — the pronounced camera array means it will always wobble.As noted above, the Motorola Edge features an LCD panel — an odd choice given the number of similarly priced phones that feature an OLED screen. Still, that doens't stop the Motorola Edge from picking up the vibrant colors of the Encanto trailer when I streamed it on YouTube or from handling the multicolored battle between Ultron and the Guardians of the Multiverse when I streamed the season finale of What If…? on Disney Plus.Our test numbers bear this out. The LCD panel of the Motorola Edge captured 123% of the sRGB color spectrum in saturated mode and 104.2% of that same spectrum in natural mode. That compares to 119.3% on the Google Pixel 5a. The screen on the Galaxy A52 5G is more colorful — in vibrant mode, it shows off 201.35% — but the colors are slightly more accurate on the Motorola panel. The Edge has a Delta-E rating of 0.21 to the Galaxy A52's 0.22 result. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)You're not getting a very bright panel with the Motorola Edge 5G UW, which we measured at 507 nits with adaptive brightness turned on. That's slightly brighter than the Pixel 5a (501 nits), but well behind the Galaxy A52 (708 nits) and iPhone 13 mini (788 nits).The true highlight of the Motorola Edge 5G UW is the phone's adaptive refresh rate, an increasingly common feature among phones in this price range. But while a lot of phones top out at 120Hz, the Motorola Edge is capable of reaching 144Hz — a refresh rate more common among the best gaming phones. You could argue that this is overkill — to the naked eye, screens scroll as smoothly at 120Hz as they do at 144Hz. Nevertheless, this is a welcome addition that adds to the Motorola Edge's value.Motorola makes a big change with the main lens on its new phone. While last year's Motorola Edge featured a 64MP sensor, the Motorola Edge 5G UW offers a 108MP wide angle camera — the kind of spec you normally see on a much more expensive phone like the Galaxy S21 Ultra. The Edge's other rear cameras are comparatively ordinary — an 8MP ultrawide angle lens with a 119-degree field of view and a dedicated 2MP depth sensor.By default, the main camera captures 12MP photos, but you can tap into settings to switch to Ultra Res mode for photos at full resolution. You can see the difference in these images of Halloween decorations — one shot with the Edge's default settings and the other in Ultra Res mode; the colors of the Ultra Res photo are richer, particularly around the flower petals. While this also gives the photo a darker cast, the shot still looks more vibrant, with greater depth. You wouldn't want to shoot at full resolution all the time — the pictures take up quite a lot of space — but it can really bring out the colors of a scene.I shot some other photos using the iPhone 13 as a comparison. Perhaps that's not the fairest of fights — Apple's $799 device is one of the best camera phones around. But the side-by-side shots do give you a sense of how far the Edge's photo capabilities have come since the disappointment of last year — and the work that still needs to be done.Sticking with those decorations for a moment, the Motorola Edge's shot in its default mode compares well to the iPhone 13's effort. That said, the iPhone 13's image-processing smarts bring out more of the colors and handle that glass jar in the background with greater aplomb. There's too much of a glare off the jar in the Motorola Edge's photo, and it detracts from the overall shot.Moving inside to a not terribly well lit plate of Chinese takeout, the Motorola Edge bathes its photo in cool tones. The shot is OK, but it lacks the warmth and definition of the iPhone 13's photo, where the orange chicken glistens, and you can make out char marks on the strips of onion. The iPhone's colors are accurate, too — an issue that came up again and again when testing the Motorola Edge 5G UW's cameras.The coolness continues at night, where the Motorola Edge's Night Vision mode captures the apples on a table lit only by an overhead light. But the apples look a little fuzzy around the edges, which can happen when there's not a lot of light to go around. Here, we see the advantage of Apple increasing the size of the iPhone 13's sensor to let in more light. The iPhone photo is not only sharp, but also colorful, as you can make out the different shades of color for each apple — a detail lacking in the Motorola Edge picture.I went down to the shoreline to try out the Motorola Edge's ultrawide angle camera, and here I think Motorola's phone is on more equal footing with the iPhone 13. It's the Motorola image that actually has the more pleasing color this time around, at least in terms of accuracy. The iPhone expends a lot of energy pumping up the blue in the sky, and that's to the detriment of the other objects in the frame. I certainly think that Coast Guard ship far in the distance stands out a little more in the Motorola Edge photo.Speaking of that Coast Guard ship, I zoomed in on it to see how the digital zoom looks on both phones. (Neither the Motorola Edge nor the iPhone 13 offers a dedicated telephoto lens.) Motorola's phone produced the crisper shot, with the edges of the ship sharply in focus. Things are a little fuzzier on the iPhone 13 at a 3x zoom.For a phone with a dedicated depth sensor, the Motorola Edge's portrait shot of my daughter disappoints. The image itself is OK, though my daughter's skin looks a little pale and washed-out in the photo. It's the half-hearted blur that mystifies here, with the bush behind my daughter and the tree she's leaning against only haphazardly blurred. The result looks more random than artistic. Contrast that with the iPhone 13, where the blur is consistent throughout, and the warmer skin tones are better rendered.On the other hand, the 32MP selfie cam on the Motorola Edge 5G UW produces some fine self-portraits, at least when compared to the iPhone 13's output. My skin looks very natural in the Motorola shot, and there's not a lot of evidence that the photo-processing software tried vainly to pretty me up. The iPhone, on the other hand, emphasizes the ruddiness in my complexion. It's a warmer portrait, but not necessarily a more accurate one.In addition to those lenses, the Motorola Edge 5G UW has a few other photographic tricks up its sleeve. There's a macro option right next to the buttons for switching between the main and ultrawide lenses. Enable macro mode and you can get up to 2cm away from your subject matter — in this case a rose that looks very detailed in the Motorola Edge's photo.On the video front, you can capture 4k video at 30fps with the rear lens and you can shoot slow-motion video in Full HD at 120 fps. But I think the more impressive feature is a dual-camera mode that shoots from the rear and front cameras simultaneously. The feature's sure to win the hearts of video bloggers, especially given how easy it is to toggle between the two shots.The Snapdragon 778G system-on-chip inside the new Motorola Edge isn't the most powerful one by Qualcomm, but it does offer more muscle than some of the other chips in Qualcomm's 7 Series. To that end, on Geekbench 5, the Motorola Edge turned in a single-core result of 764 and a multicore result of 2,716. That's ahead of the respective results of 637 and 1,866 turned in by the Galaxy A52 5G and its Snapdragon 750G chipset. Really, the Motorola Edge 5G UW's numbers are more in line with the Galaxy S20 FE, which produced a 2,928 multicore score on Geekbench with older Snapdragon 865 silicon.In terms of graphics test results, the Motorola Edge once again outperformed phones with less powerful Snapdragon Series 7 chipsets like the Galaxy A52 and Pixel 5a (which uses a Snapdragon 765G). In 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited, the Motorola Edge 5G UW managed to produce a result of 14.8 frames per second, topping the respective 10 fps and 6.6 fps results for the Pixel 5a and Galaxy A52.That translates to some solid if not spectacular performance on the Motorola Edge 5G UW, as I used the phone in everyday tasks. Apps launch promptly enough, and I had no trouble switching between open applications. Graphically intensive games like Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile performed well on the Motorola 5G UW, though I noticed a couple of stutters when tracking the movements of my teammates on the latter game.My biggest objection to gaming on the new Motorola Edge, though, has nothing to do with performance, but more to do with sound. The phone features a single speaker on the bottom, and when you're holding the phone in landscape mode, chances are good your hand will cover that speaker. That leads to muffled sound, and on a game like PUBG Mobile, where you have to listen for your enemy's approach, that can mean an untimely demise.As noted, the version of the Motorola Edge I tested works with Verizon's Ultrawide Band 5G network. That's only available in portions of 87 cities as of this writing, though Motorola's slower nationwide 5G has a broader reach. Alas, that does not include my house, indicating that the much ballyhooed benefits of 5G remain elusive for some users at this point.Fast-refreshing displays can put a serious hit on battery life, and we see that with the Motorola Edge 5G UW's 144Hz refresh rate on its 5,000 mAh battery. When that mode is enabled, the phone produces very pedestrian times on our battery test, in which we have a phone continuously surf the web over cellular until it runs out of power. When the display was set to 144Hz, the Motorola Edge 5G UW lasted 9 hours and 23 minutes, which is a little more than half-an-hour shorter than the average smartphone. Set the refresh rate to 60Hz, though and times improve dramatically. At 60Hz, the Motorola Edge can hold out for 11 hours and 38 minutes — good enough for a spot on our list of best phone battery life. We'd recommend setting the phone's display to automatically adjust its refresh rate, which will let you enjoy smoother scrolling without the hit on battery life that comes when you lock in the phone at 144Hz.At least the Motorola Edge lasts longer than the iPhone 13 mini (8:54) even with that battery-draining 144Hz mode enabled. The Edge's battery test result is just a shade behind the Google Pixel 5a's time of 9 hours and 45 minutes. Among comparable phones, the Galaxy A52 outperforms the Motorola Edge, though it too sees its time drop when you enable the display's faster refresh rate.Motorola has equipped this year's version of the Edge with 30W TurboPower charging, which promises speedy recharging. Using the charger that came with the Motorola Edge, we got a drained phone back up to 56% charge after 30 minutes. The Pixel 5a gets up to 43% while the Galaxy A52 reaches 31% in that same time.The Motorola Edge 5G UW launches with Android 11 installed. With Android 12 launching this month and coming to Motorola's phones at a later date, that takes care of one of the two promised software upgrades; you can also expect two years of bi-monthly service upgrades. That seems skimpy, especially at a time when Samsung and Google are offering longer support for their Android devices.I do happen to like Motorola's My UX interface, which leaves the Android operating system largely untouched, save for a couple of useful add-ons. These include support of gesture controls such as being able to twist your wrist to launch the camera and taking a screenshot by touching and holding the display with three fingers. My UX is packed with useful shortcuts like those, but if you don't find them to your liking, you can always disable them in the Moto app.The Motorola Edge also supports Ready For, Motorola's feature for using your smartphone as a portable PC. As with other Ready For phones, the Motorola Edge 5G UW can connect to a monitor with either a USB-C to USB-C or USB-C to HDMI cable. From there, you'll get a Windows 10-style interface, letting you use your Android apps on a bigger display. My colleague Richard Priday tested Ready For earlier this year on a different Motorola phone and found it to be a work in progress, but it's a nice feature to have for productivity mavens.Finally, this Verizon-tied version of the Motorola Edge includes Verizon Adaptive Sound, which you can find in the Sound section of the phone's settings app. Verizon Adaptive Sound is meant to make the phone's lone speaker sound more expansive. It makes a difference — audio sounds a lot deeper and richer when you've got Verizon Adaptive Sound enabled, even if it's nothing that can compete with stereo speakers.If you've overlooked Motorola's higher-end phones in the past, the Motorola Edge 5G UW does a very good job at trying to regain your attention. Improvements to the main camera impress, and even if this can't topple a premium camera phone like the iPhone 13, it's a vast improvement over the previous Motorola Edge. I'm also impressed by how quickly the phone recharges.The 144Hz refresh rate is probably a step too far, given the impact it has on what would have been solid battery life — especially when a 120Hz refresh rate would have been more than enough at this price point. I also think the lone speaker detracts from what would otherwise be an enjoyable gaming experience on an affordable phone.It's the affordability that ultimately wins the day for the Motorola Edge 5G UW. At less than $600 for the Verizon-tied version — and only a little bit more for the unlocked Motorola Edge (2021) — this phone offers enough premium features to put it at the forefront of midrange options. If you're looking for high-end features without a correspondingly high price tag, make sure that the Motorola Edge 5G UW is on your shortlist."
14,iPhone 13 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-13-pro,"Price: Starts at $999 Display: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED (2352 x 1170) Refresh rate: 10-120Hz CPU: A15 Bionic RAM: 6GB Rear cameras: 12MP (f/1.5) main, 12MP (f/1.8) ultrawide, 12MP (f/2.8) telephoto with 3x optical zoom Front camera: 12MP (f/2.2) Video: Up to 4K 60 fps, 4K 30 fps ProRes (256GB+), 1080p 30 fps ProRes (128GB), 1080p 30 fps (Cinematic Mode) Battery life (hrs:min): 11:42 Charging: 20W wired, 15W MagSafe Size: 5.8 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches Weight: 7.19 ouncesI’ve seen a lot of phones in my career, but the iPhone 13 Pro is the best phone I’ve ever reviewed. Apple's latest handset raises the bar so much that it’s hard to find any true fault with the iPhone 13 Pro except maybe the lack of Touch ID and that the charging speed still maxes out at 20W.But consider what the iPhone 13 Pro does bring. From an excellent and bright 120Hz OLED display to the A15 Bionic’s crushing performance, this is one powerful device. If you’re a fan of slender phones, this is about as good as it gets for a phone with a 6.1-inch screen. Best of all, there’s no feature disparity between this model and the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Both phones have the same telephoto zoom capabilities and all four iPhone 13 models have sensor-shift optical image stabilization. You’re not losing anything by opting for the cheaper and smaller iPhone 13 Pro.In this iPhone 13 Pro review, I’ll walk you through why this is one of the best phones you can buy — it is the best if you want a smaller screen. Be sure to also check out our iPhone 13 Pro Max review, as well as our iPhone 13 review and iPhone 13 mini review. And if you do decide to buy the iPhone 13 Pro, make sure you also pick up one of the best iPhone 13 Pro cases.As with every iPhone, the iPhone 13 Pro is available from nearly every carrier in addition to Apple. And the iPhone 13 Pro is available to buy right now, starting at $999 for the 128GB model. From there, a 256GB version costs $1,099, while the 512GB sets you back $1,299. For the first time ever, Apple offers a 1TB iPhone 13 Pro, which costs $1,499 — as much as a 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 chip and a 512GB hard drive.In the U.K. the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro starts at £949, that ramps up to £1,049 for the 265GB model and £1,249 for the 512GB version. If you have deep pockets, then the 1TB iPhone 13 Pro will cost a hefty £1,449. I encourage you to check out our best iPhone 13 deals page to ensure that you get the best offer, whether you opt for a trade-in, payment plan, or buy the phone outright. And also check out our iPhone 13 delays page to see the latest shipment date info. The iPhone 13 Pro looks remarkably similar to the iPhone 12 Pro except for two key differences: the bigger camera hump and the smaller notch. The former is pretty self-evident. The lenses and the square around them stick out quite noticeably — the phone is far from flat when laying on a table or desk.The smaller notch is worthy of note, though. Apple says it’s about 20% smaller than the one we’re all used to. In practice, you can definitely tell the difference when you hold up the new phone next to an iPhone 12 Pro.The smaller notch is certainly a step in the right direction, though I still find it unsightly. Since Apple remains all-in on Face ID, the notch is here to stay for now — under-display TrueDepth tech is probably still a ways off.On that note, a serious omission on the iPhone 13 Pro is Touch ID. Rumors suggested that Apple was testing in-display fingerprint technology similar to what you find on many of the best Android phones. In a world where the COVID-19 pandemic is still raging and many of us are heavily encouraged to wear masks, I think Apple failing to offer an unlock alternative to Face ID remains a problem. The Apple Watch workaround introduced with iOS 14.5 earlier this year isn’t good enough.A stainless steel frame gives the iPhone 13 Pro a serious heft. It feels heavier, more solid, than the 7.19 ounces Apple lists as the phone’s weight. While my time with the phone has been brief up until now, I did feel wrist and pinky fatigue while using it, more so than the iPhone 12 Pro I use as a daily driver.Because the iPhone 13 Pro’s design is largely unchanged, it feels more like an iterative upgrade over its predecessor instead of one pushing the boundaries. I think Apple played it safe this year, instead focusing on the display and camera enhancements.With the same size OLED panel as its predecessor, the iPhone 13 Pro packs a lot of pixels in a screen that measures 6.1 inches diagonally. Apple calls this the latest version of its Super Retina XDR technology, and it sure is pretty. Colors pop, there’s plenty of contrast, and the viewing angles are stellar.Whether I was playing the anime-inspired, saturated Genshin Impact or watching the harsh orange scenes in the latter part of Blade Runner 2049, the iPhone 13 Pro’s display delivered in every regard. Even vibrant cyberpunk or retrowave images with their bright neon pinks, magentas and purples looked stunning.Here’s how the iPhone 13 Pro’s screen stacks up against the Galaxy S21 Plus and iPhone 12 Pro in display benchmarks.The iPhone 13 managed similar color saturation to its predecessor, and its Delta-E color accuracy score (where 0 is perfect) was about the same as the iPhone 12 Pro’s. But pay attention to the max brightness we measured in our lab: 1,024 nits is insanely bright.Of course, the star this year is the 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate on both the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. The ProMotion experience is really nice. The iPhone 13 Pro’s display can automatically jump between 10Hz and 120Hz, offering a smooth experience that adapts to not only the content on screen, but also how fast your finger swipes across the glass.Once you experience a 120Hz display, it’s hard to go back to a 60Hz one. The same holds true for the iPhone 13 Pro, which has a noticeably smoother screen than the 12 Pro. Side-by-side, I strongly prefer the ProMotion display. Not only is it easier to read text on a web page while scrolling, but the crisp animations jumping between emails in Gmail or just unlocking the phone all make for an extremely premium experience.Some third-party apps are apparently experiencing problems with ProMotion, with the display either locking at 60Hz or jumping between 60Hz and 120Hz, but Apple says a fix will come soon in a software update. It's not something I've experienced, though, and while I wouldn’t say that the iPhone 13 Pro has the best display on the market, it’s certainly very, very good and more competitive now thanks to ProMotion.The iPhone 13 Pro comes equipped with three 12MP rear cameras, including a telephoto lens offering a 77mm focal length and 3x optical zoom. The main shooter features a larger sensor and wider aperture this year at f/1.5, so it can let in more light than before. The 12MP 120-degree ultrawide also received a larger sensor, as well as autofocus for sharper super wide-angle shots. It’s in low-light where the new phone really shines, especially over its predecessor and the competition.In this photo of a collection of signs, the iPhone 13 Pro kept an interesting balance. Not only are the colors more natural, but they’re also vibrant. I compared the iPhone’s camera to the Galaxy S21 Plus, which produced a surprisingly washed-out image, as if the phone struggled to compensate for the sunlight. The iPhone’s focus is also sharper and the contrast is stronger.With this photo of an old trailer with the weeping willow in the background, the iPhone handled the direct sunlight very well. The image is well-lit with plenty of detail and depth. The S21 Plus’ shot is dimmer and more muted. The focus is also softer in that telltale Samsung way.Moving inside, I captured this warm, artificially-lit scene. There’s a lot going on this image from the lamp in the foreground to the backlighting and multitude of shadows. The iPhone managed a pretty nice image with proper tones and sharp focus. The S21 Plus struggled with soft focus and proper contrast again, creating an image that feels flatter than the iPhone’s.Another indoor shot offered some excellent natural lighting and more color variation than our last scenario. The iPhone 13 Pro’s image is vibrant, capturing the autumn-esque colors near perfectly. From the oranges to the dark greens, the iPhone’s picture is cozier. The S21 Plus’ photo isn’t too bad, but it once again struggles with soft focus and ever-so-slightly washed out colors. The lines on the wall look almost smoothed over, making for a flatter image.Trying out the ultrawide lens, I challenged the iPhone 13 Pro to take a good photo of this pile of bright orange pumpkins in direct sunlight. The final image is pretty good, with natural color balance, proper exposure, and sharp focus — the autofocus on the ultrawide camera this year definitely helps. The Galaxy S21 Plus did the typical Samsung thing by oversaturating the colors, notably on the plants in the background. It takes on a fantasy oil painting vibe. The focus also seems off, too.For the telephoto test, I took a picture of these knick-knacks from across the room. The yellow ducks, blue birds, and red frame look plenty colorful in the iPhone’s shot, even if the image feels a bit too warm for my liking. The S21 Plus’ photo is cooler, but the colors in the aren’t as vibrant as the iPhone’s. Both phones struggled with this scene.For portraits, I had my photographer stand a few feet away from me. The iPhone 13 Pro has a much stronger bokeh effect around my face, artistically blurring the hats on the wall behind me. It did make my face really red and splotchy, but I’ll chalk that up to a hot day and being indoors without A/C. The Galaxy S21 Plus had a much weaker blur radius and it didn’t draw enough attention to the subject. It also applied too much face smoothing by default.The night mode shots were interesting, if only to see the differences between them. It’s strange to say that the S21 Plus’ image is brighter than the iPhone’s. It’s also a bit sharper with better colors. The iPhone 13 Pro’s Night Mode should have surpassed the Galaxy S21 Plus’, but in this nearly pitch black scene (to my eye), it did not.I found this incredibly surprising, and I noticed a similar thing with the iPhone 13 mini (which faced off against the regular Galaxy S21). Apple touted improvements to Night Mode — which also works on the ultrawide and telephoto cameras now — so seeing the results here, which speak for themselves, left me flabbergasted.Apple talked up the new macro mode that uses the ultrawide lens to take photos of subjects at up to 2 cm away. I tried this out on this yellow flower, getting pretty close to it. Overall, the image looks pretty good, with sharp details and on-point focus. Compare this to the Galaxy S21 Plus, where I simply used the zoom lens to get close. Here you can see soft focus, colors that are too warm, weak contrast that makes the image look flat.The iPhone’s picture could use some work in post-processing to be presentable, but it ultimately shows that a phone doesn’t need a dedicated macro lens to take some cool pictures.The macro mode is an automatic switch, but Apple says, ""A new setting will be added in a software update this fall to turn off automatic camera switching when shooting at close distances for macro photography and video.""Finally, the iPhone 13 Pro features a 12MP front camera with support for Night Mode selfies. It captured the proper amount of warmness from the scene, which made my ruddy face stand out. But at the same time, the Galaxy S21 Plus produced a cooler image with my eyes being a bit brighter. It also seemed to do better with the harsh backlighting.The iPhone 13 Pro includes Photographic Styles — essentially preset filters, though calling them just that would be a disservice. Each style appears in real-time, letting you find the right lighting and color balance option to match the artistic look you’re going for. From Vibrant to High Contrast, these modes offer new ways of taking pictures without applying filters after the fact. These work on both the front and rear cameras. Above is a gallery of the default mode and the four options you get out of the box — you can customize them to your liking later.For the last several years, the iPhone has been the phone to get if you cared about video recording. New with the iPhone 13 Pro is Cinematic Mode, which is essentially the portrait video we heard rumors about. This new mode is much more than that, though, offering a truly professional and artistic way to shoot videos. Cinematic Mode not only applies a bokeh effect around the subject, but it tracks said subject as you shoot.For example, it can tell when a subject enters or leaves the frame, dynamically shifting the focus accordingly. Or if the subject looks behind them, the iPhone 13 Pro will shift to the area that the person is looking at. In this mode, you can record at 1080p 30 fps. Cinematic Mode is really cool in practice, and expertly shows off the power of the A15 Bionic’s Neural Engine, but I’m not sure how often an average user will take advantage of it.For a more traditional video approach, the iPhone 13 Pro supports Dolby Vision HDR at up to 4K 60 fps. You can also shoot in the ProRes format, which lends itself well to professional-grade editing — which you can also edit on the iPhone 13 Pro, thanks to the phone’s processing power. However, ProRes in 4K 30 fps is only available on the 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB iPhone 13 Pro models. The 128GB version is limited to 1080p at 30 fps for ProRes.To learn more, see our tutorial on how to record ProRes video on the iPhone 13 Pro series. New with the iPhone 13 series is the A15 Bionic system-on-chip. It features a six-core CPU and a 5-core GPU on the Pro models, plus an upgraded Neural Engine. (The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini make do with quad-core GPUs). Paired with 6GB of RAM, the iPhone 13 Pro is a veritable powerhouse, leagues ahead of the best Android has to offer. The A15 crushes the Snapdragon 888 and further proves the quality of Apple’s deft hand with silicon. The iPhone 13 Pro’s graphical prowess is not to be underestimated. The GPU in the A15 Bionic is powerful, with Apple claiming it’s 50% faster than the competition (likely referring to the Snapdragon 888 and its Adreno 660 GPU). It’s difficult to measure real-world gaming performance since iOS doesn’t let you track framerates in games, but the more intensive titles like Genshin Impact and Asphalt 9 look great on the iPhone 13 Pro. I included the iPhone 12 Pro in this comparison so that you could see the generational improvement from last year. Not only has the A15 Bionic improved over the A14, but it is several leaps ahead of the Snapdragon 888 in the Galaxy S21 Plus. Nothing in Android land can hold a candle to the A15, even if synthetic benchmarks aren’t necessarily analogous to real life.Using Adobe Premiere Rush, we try to get a sense of real-world performance by having a phone transcode a 4K video file to 1080p. The iPhone 12 Pro could already knock out the test in a blistering 27 seconds while the Galaxy S21 Plus lags far behind at a flat minute. The iPhone 13 Pro managed to perform the transcode in just 26 seconds. It’s not a huge jump over the A14-equipped iPhone 12 Pro, but it furthers Apple’s lead over Qualcomm.3DMark’s Wild Life is a graphics benchmark, and I included the original and Extreme test results. The Extreme Unlimited benchmark brings any phone to its knees, even the iPhone 13 Pro. But the average framerate in the original Wild Life Unlimited test shows a huge boost over the A14, and a massive step ahead of the Galaxy S21 Plus.This all to say, the iPhone 13 Pro is the most powerful phone you can get right now (along with its big brother, the iPhone 13 Pro Max). Android and its multitude of devices certainly have their own strengths, but the hardware backing the ecosystem has a hard time keeping up with Apple’s own chips. Check out our iPhone 13 benchmarks page to see how the iPhone 13 Pro and all the new iPhones compare to each other and the Android phone competition. Apple upgraded its phones’ 5G capabilities this year, furthering the steps made with the iPhone 12 series. The iPhone 13 Pro features more 5G bands this time around, meaning it can work more places and on more carriers. Smart Data Mode returns, letting your phone switch to LTE when 5G isn’t needed (and theoretically saving on battery life).We’re still in the early days of 5G and, thanks to some rollout issues, it’s not always an improved experience everywhere you go. But that’s a carrier problem. Rest assured that the iPhone 13 Pro has the hardware chops to handle future network improvements.We don’t know the iPhone 13 Pro’s battery capacity because Apple doesn’t disclose that information. Teardowns will fill in that info, but we do know from Apple that there’s bigger batteries in this year’s iPhones.To that end, Apple says the iPhone 13 Pro lasts up to 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12 Pro. Apple is usually fairly conservative in its battery life estimates, so I was excited to see how the new phone would perform in the Tom’s Guide battery test, where we force a phone to endlessly reload web pages on a cellular connection until it dies. The larger battery in the iPhone 13 Pro certainly pays off, increasing the phone’s longevity by nearly 3 hours over its predecessor and more than 2 hours longer than the Galaxy S21 Plus for a total time of 11 hours and 42 minutes. For reference, the last iPhone hit 9 hours and 6 minutes while the Galaxy S21 Plus managed 9 hours and 41 minutes.This is a major benefit for people looking to upgrade, seeing as the iPhone 13 Pro landed on our best phone battery life list even with an adaptive display and power-hungry 5G connectivity. Seeing such a jump over the iPhone 12 Pro’s lackluster battery life is certainly impressive — even the Galaxy S21 Plus can’t compare. Head over to our iPhone 13 battery life results page to see how the iPhone 13 Pro compares to the other new iPhones and the best Android phones. Unfortunately, Apple hasn’t figured out how to include faster charging on this phone. The iPhone 13 Pro maxes out at 20W wired and 15W via MagSafe. In a world where the OnePlus 9 Pro can charge at 65W over a cable or at 50W wirelessly — or where Xiaomi has gotten to 120W — Apple’s paltry offering is just disappointing. The iPhone 12 Pro only hit 53% in 30 minutes in our testing.The iPhone 13 Pro still uses a Lightning connector instead of USB-C, which even the new iPads use. There’s no charger in the box either, continuing a trend Apple started with the iPhone 12 release.The iPhone 13 Pro ships with iOS 15. We’ve covered the latest version of Apple’s mobile OS quite extensively since we got our hands on the beta over the course of the summer. There are quite a few features to take note of, such as a tweak to notifications, Live Text/Visual Look Up, Focus, FaceTime enhancements, and improvements to many of the core apps. I encourage you to check out our extensive coverage of the update, including our iOS 15 review.I didn’t find any iPhone 13-specific software features (other than the camera and video stuff I mentioned earlier), but I think iOS 15 is best experienced on the iPhone 13 Pro because of the ProMotion display and the A15 Bionic chip. That’s usually the case — the newest hardware runs the latest software version the best and shows off everything it has to offer.If you have an Apple Watch, we do suggest you proceed with caution if you're going to buy an iPhone 13 Pro right away, as a caveat with on the software side of things in that it appears iPhone 13 models are having a problem unlocking with the Apple Watch. However, this issue doesn't appear to be affecting every single user and Apple has officially acknowledged the problem and has stated a fix is coming soon.As is often the case with a new phone release, iPhone 13 owners have already encountered a few problems. For example, some iPhone 13 users are finding that the phone won't unlock with an Apple Watch, though a fix is on the way. There are also issues with the touch display reportedly not being responsive enough in some cases, though that could be an iOS 15 issue rather than an iPhone 13 one. As far as the iPhone 13 Pros go, there are complaints that the cameras are automatically switching between lenses without warning; an update that will enable users to turn this off is said to be coming. Plus, the ProMotion displays on the iPhone 13 Pros are not running at 120Hz with some apps, which Apple will be addressing in an update. And developers need to optimize their apps as well. See our iPhone 13 problems roundup for more info. The iPhone 13 Pro and its bigger brother are the best phones you can buy right now. This smaller Pro model is better suited for people who balk at larger phones. The battery life has vastly improved over past iPhone models, which is a serious point in this device’s favor. And Apple has proven its prowess with cameras, with the iPhone 13 Pro producing some beautiful photos and videos.I have two gripes with this phone, though. I’d like to see faster charging, but more importantly, I really wanted to see Touch ID this year. Despite the annoyance of unlocking the iPhone 13 Pro manually, and a second time to use Apple Pay, though, the iPhone 13 Pro has basically everything else going for it.Of course, you might decide to wait for the iPhone 14 before you upgrade from your current Apple phone; if so check, out the seven biggest upgrades we want to see from the iPhone 14.But, if you want the absolute best experience on a phone possible right now, this is the device to get. Assuming you’re used to iOS, you won’t be disappointed."
15,iPhone 13 Pro Max,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-13-pro-max,"The iPhone 13 Pro Max is what happens when you get practically everything you could want in a phone. This premium flagship (from $1,099) packs a 120Hz refresh rate display, the fastest performance of any handset and epic battery life.But it’s the iPhone 13 Pro Max's cameras that put this phone over the top, as they're the best I've tested on a phone so far. You can shoot Cinematic mode videos with a compelling bokeh effect, choose your own Photographic styles and take super close-up shots with a new macro mode that leverages the ultra-wide camera. Starting price: $1,099 Storage: 128, 256, 512, 1TB Battery life (hrs:min): 12:16 Screen size: 6.7 inches Resolution (ppi): 2778 x 1284 (458) Adaptive refresh: Up to 120Hz Processor: A15 Bionic Rear cameras: Pro 12MP (Telephoto, Wide, Ultra Wide) Zoom: 3x optical / 15x digital Front camera: 12MP TrueDepth Colors: Graphite, Gold, Silver, Sierra Blue Size: 6.3 x 3.1 x 0.3 inches Weight: 8.5 ounces Water resistance: IP68The iPhone 13 Pro Max’s camera bump is definitely more prominent this time around, thanks to the larger sensors, and the overall design is heftier than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. But I do like that the notch on the 6.7-inch display is smaller. Check out our iPhone 13 Pro review if you want all the same features in a more compact and slightly less expensive phone.If you're looking for something more affordable and don't need a telephoto lens or 120Hz display, check out our iPhone 13 review and iPhone 13 mini review. While I wish Apple offered faster charging and Touch ID, as you’ll see in my full iPhone 13 Pro Max review, this is the best iPhone — and best phone period.The iPhone 13 Pro Max is available to buy right now, starting at $1,099 for 128GB of storage. Going up to 256GB costs $1,199, 512GB is $1,399 and the whopping 1TB option is priced at a gulp-inducing $1,599.On the other side of the Atlantic in the U.K., the 128GB iPhone 13 Pro Max starts at £1,049, hitting £1,149 for the 265GB model and £1,349 for the 512GB version. If you have plenty of money to burn and want a lot of storage, then the 1TB iPhone 13 Pro will cost a wallet-walloping £1,549.Note that you can save on the iPhone 13 Pro Max if you trade in your old iPhone or other phone. And we’re tracking the best iPhone 13 deals to help you save some money on this rather pricey Apple phone.The iPhone 13 Pro Max retains the flat edges of the iPhone 12 Pro Max but looks a bit different. For one, the camera array is larger than before, so it takes up a bit more real estate on the back of the phone.Weighing 8.46 ounces, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is also notably heavier than its 8.03-ounce predecessor. But I’ll allow that given the new iPhone Pro has a larger battery.On the plus side, the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s notch is a bit smaller on the display, as Apple shrunk it 20% while retaining the same key Face ID tech. It’s not a full-screen look, but it’s an improvement over recent iPhones.My only real complaint with the iPhone 13’s design is that it doesn’t offer Touch ID, either in the power button or underneath the display. At a time many people are still wearing masks in public places, it would be nice to have an alternative way to easily unlock our iPhones.There have been some user complaints that the iPhone 13 series is having issues unlocking with the Apple Watch, which is supposed to work while you're wearing a mask. Fortunately, Apple says that a fix is coming. The iPhone 13 Pro Max comes in four colors: graphite, gold, silver and sierra blue. I would opt for the blue model if paying with my own money. The graphite model I tested has a sleek professional vibe, but it’s not as playful.The biggest upgrade to the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s display — and biggest upgrade overall — is the new ProMotion display. This 6.7-inch panel can dynamically scale its refresh rate from 10Hz to 120Hz, which results in smoother overall performance and animations.For example, when scrolling on The New York Times homepage with the iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 12 Pro Max side by side, I could more easily read the text on Apple’s newer phone when quickly scrolling on both displays. It just feels more responsive.These benefits carry over to other activities as well, such as swiping between apps or returning to the home screen. But I’m more excited by apps that take advantage of ProMotion. This includes Catalyst Black, a frenetic online battle game that had me shooting in all directions and transforming into monsters. And the whole experience was wonderfully fluid. The iPhone 13 Pro Max and iPhone 13 Pro currently have an issue where certain third-party apps are not running at 120Hz. Apple says that a fix is coming. Another plus for the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s screen is its increased brightness. We measured an average of 837 nits with the Adaptive setting off and 1,038 nits with with Adaptive on. The iPhone 12 Pro Max averaged 654 nits with Adaptive off. The Galaxy S21 Ultra maxes out at 821 nits.The iPhone 13 Pro Max’s display delivers stunning detail even in low-light scenes. When watching the trailer for James Bond No Time to Die, I could make out every creepy crevice in Rami Malek’s transformed face.The iPhone 13 Pro Max has a bigger camera array for a reason. The main wide camera is Apple’s largest yet at 1.9μm pixels (up from 1.7μm) while offering a f/1.5 aperture, which is rated to deliver a 49% more light thant the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And the ultrawide camera offers a larger f/1.8 aperture (was f/2.4 for iPhone 13 Pro Max) for brighter pics while offering a wider field of view.Zooming on the iPhone 13 Pro Max gets a boost as well, as the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s telephoto lens offers a 3x optical zoom, up from 2.5x on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.And there’s lots of camera upgrades beyond the hardware. For example, the iPhone 13 Pro Max leverages the ultrawide camera to capture images as close as 2 cm away. I really enjoyed getting up close with this piece of wood on a nearby beach. While the iPhone 12 Pro Max struggled to get close, I could capture every nook and cranny with the new iPhone.The iPhone 13 Pro Max also did a superb job capturing this purple pansy, with rich color and lots of details in the petals. And I got real close to this dreaded spotted lanternfly crawling in the rocks; I could even make out each of its legs and fine lines in its wings. Another new iPhone 13 camera feature is Photographic styles, which lets you choose how you want your photos to look in terms of tone and warmth. Your options include standard, rich contrast, vibrant, warm, cool. And you can adjust these as you see fit. In terms of overall image quality, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is a step ahead of the other best camera phones. Take this photo of pumpkins, which has the sun overhead and a fair amount of shadow. The iPhone 13 Pro Max captures a more vibrant sign in the foreground and the pumpkins themselves look more vibrant than in the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s shot. However, Samsung’s photo is a bit brighter overall.The iPhone 13 Pro Max takes a more pleasing portrait of me standing in front of the Manasquan reservoir. My face and green shirt are both brighter. And if you’re hanging on to an older phone like the iPhone 11 Pro, you can see how much better the new iPhone is; I come out dark and fuzzy in this shot. The more complex a photo is, the more the iPhone 13 Pro Max shines, as evidenced by this comparison shot taken near the edge of the water. The iPhone’s photo more accurately captures the translucence of the water while making the surrounding rocks pop, while the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s pic looks flat by comparison. Despite a jump from 2.5 to 3x for the telephoto zoom on the iPhone 13 Pro Max, it’s still behind Samsung’s best. Zooming in on some boats at 3x, I prefer the slightly brighter images from the S21 Ultra in this case. And at 15x digital zoom, the writing on the boat looks sharper in the Samsung shot. At least the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s 15x zoom is better than the 12x max digital zoom on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.The iPhone 13 Pro Max’s bigger sensor shines in this selfie comparison with the iPhone 12 Pro Max. My face and blue shirt look brighter with the new iPhone while I get a little bit lost in the shadows with last year’s camera.When it comes to ultrawide photos, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is neck and neck with the Galaxy S21 Ultra here. But I give a slight edge to the new iPhone because of the detail in the rock and especially the ripples in the water.To test the iPhone 13 Pro Max in low light I shot these hydrangea flowers at night in nearly complete darkness. Neither image looks very sharp, but the iPhone delivers a more accurate pink and brighter green leaves.The Cinematic video mode on the iPhone 13 Pro Max is so good that you’ll feel like a mini Spielberg. That’s certainly how I felt after shooting several clips that apply a bokeh effect to your footage and automatically switch the focus to multiple subjects depending on what’s going on in the frame.In one video I recorded of a German Shepherd and Shepherd-Rottweiler mix, I appreciated how the iPhone 13 Pro Max automatically blurred out the dog in the background, resulting in a sense of depth, and I could change the focus point on the fly just by pressing on the display.I also had fun with the Cinematic mode by having my son capture me walking along a trail and attempting a layup playing basketball. In both cases, the iPhone 13 Pro Max delivered a convincing bokeh with the video. Check out the video below to see how iPhone 13 cinematic mode works. Unfortunately, the resolution for Cinematic mode is capped at 1080p across the entire iPhone range, so you can’t have portrait mode videos and 4K quality at the same time. If you want even more creative control, the iPhone 13 Pro Max supports ProRes video, a format preferred by video editors. You can record in ProRes up to 30 fps in 4K, but note that only the 256GB and higher models support 4K; the 128GB model is limited to 1080p in ProRes likely because these files take up so much storage. Check out our how to record ProRes video on the iPhone 13 Pro tutorial for more. info. No matter what you shoot, you won’t be disappointed in the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s video quality. In this sweeping shot of the Manasquan river, everything from the sky trees and puffy clouds to the rippling water and swaying branches looks DSLR-like. However, I did notice a little noise as I zoomed in at 3x.Thanks to its new A15 Bionic chipset, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is ridiculously fast and grabs the title of world’s fastest phone. I got totally lost in the Warp Drive racing game, which delivers fast frame rates and silky smooth action even as you zoom (and sometimes teleport) around the track.And I also got a kick out of Seek, which flexes the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s machine learning muscles by instantly identifying several plants around my abode, from coleus to new guinea impatiens.In terms of benchmarks, the iPhone 13 Pro Max once again destroys the Android competition. In Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the iPhone 13 Pro Max notched a multi-core score of 4,549 and a single-core score of 1,720. The Galaxy S21 Ultra hit 3,440 and 1,123, respectively, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max reached 4,111 and 1,603. Interestingly, the iPhone 13 scored a slightly lower 4,436/1,668, which we think could be due to the Pro Max having more RAM. (Apple doesn’t reveal how much memory it puts into its different iPhone models.)You should expect a graphics boost on the iPhone 13 Pro Max, as it vaulted ahead of the competition on the 3DMark Wild Life unlimited test. It registered a frame rate of 68.4 frames per second, compared to 54 fps for the iPhone 12 Pro Max and 34 fps for the Galaxy S21 Ultra.Video editing should be quick work for this phone, too, as it took only 25 seconds for the iPhone 13 Pro Max to transcode a 4K file to 1080p in the Adobe Premiere Rush app. That’s only a little faster than the 28.5 seconds from the iPhone 12 Pro Max but way speedier than the Samsung’s 1:02 time.Check out our iPhone 13 benchmarks page to see how the iPhone 13 Pro Max and all the new iPhones compare to each other and the Android phone competition. Now we come to one of the best parts of the iPhone 13 Pro Max review: battery life. Thanks to a larger battery and other enhancements, the iPhone 13 Pro Max lasted a fantastic 12 hours and 16 minutes on the Tom’s Guide battery test, which surfs the web over 5G continuously at 150 nits of screen brightness.The iPhone 12 Pro Max last year lasted 10 hours and 53 minutes and Galaxy S21 Ultra endured for 11:25. Anything above 11 hours is great, so the iPhone 13 Pro Max earns a spot on our best phone battery life list. Head over to our iPhone 13 battery life results page to see how the iPhone 13 Pro Max compares to the other new iPhones and the best Android phones. The news is not that great on the charging front, as the iPhone 13 Pro Max reaches just 50% capacity after 30 minutes using a 20W UBC-C charger, while other phones like the OnePlus 9 Pro and Xiaomi 11T Pro can get to 100% in 30 minutes or less. MagSafe charging, while convenient, is even slower at 15W.There is some good news. The iPhone 13 Pro Max can get to 100% in a fairly brisk 90 minutes if you use a higher-power 30W charger. It costs $49 from Apple. iOS 15 isn’t the leap iOS 14 was in terms of adding widgets, but it delivers some smart and fun upgrades. FaceTime gets some needed audio and video improvements and a future iOS 15 update will let you listen to music or watch movies or TV shows with friends or family. And the Messages app has a new Shared with You section for easier access to shared photos, articles and more.I especially like the new Focus feature in iOS 15, which lets you filter notifications based on what you’re doing. Notifications are also more streamlined, thanks with a new summary view so you don’t get overwhelmed.Other iOS 15 goodies include a redesigned Safari (I actually don’t like the address bar at the bottom, but you can change it), a more full-featured Weather app and an enhanced Maps app with more detail and better road views. Last but not least, Live Text gives you Google Lens-like powers by recognizing text in real time via the camera for looking up things.Thus far iPhone 13 owners have encountered a few problems. For example, some iPhone 13 users are finding that the phone won't unlock with an Apple Watch, though a fix  is on the way. In addition, some iPhone 13 owners are complaining about the touch display not being responsive enough in some cases, which could be an iOS 15 issue. On the iPhone 13 Pros in particular, there are complaints that the cameras are automatically switching between lenses without warning, and Apple will be rolling out an update that will enable users to turn this off. And the ProMotion displays on the iPhone 13 Pros are not running at 120Hz with some apps, which Apple will be addressing in an update. Of course, developers need to optimize their apps as well.See our iPhone 13 problems roundup for more info.The iPhone 13 Pro Max is that rare phone that gets a 5-star rating from us. You get superior cameras and video recording capabilities — including the very compelling Cinematic mode and macro mode — blistering performance and a very responsive 120Hz display. Plus, the battery life is even better this time around and among the best we’ve seen from a 5G flagship.I also appreciate the slightly better 3x optical zoom and 15x digital zoom on the iPhone 13 Pro Max, the brighter screen and the slightly smaller notch. But I wish Apple could deliver faster charging, and I’d like to see a sleeker design next time around with the iPhone 14 with less of a camera bump and perhaps full-screen look. Some may simply prefer the iPhone 13 Pro because it’s smaller and lighter, as there are no other functional differences between the two handsets. But if you prefer a bigger screen, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is the closest thing to perfect you can get in a phone.Of course, you might want to wait another year for the iPhone 14 before you decide upgrade from your current Apple phone; if so check, out the seven biggest upgrades we want to see from the iPhone 14."
16,iPhone XR,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-xr,review-5868.html","Update: The iPhone XR has officially been discontinued by Apple but the iPhone 11 is a very good alternative at $499. Some carriers and retailers are still stocking the iPhone XR for now and it can be had for a lower price. The iPhone XR remains a good buy if you're looking for an iPhone under $500. You get a roomy 6.1-inch display, swift performance from Apple's A12 Bionic processor and good camera quality in a colorful design. Most important, the price is a very reasonable $499.There are some features you don't get here with the iPhone XR, such as a Night mode for the camera, 5G or an OLED display. If you can handle a smaller phone, the 4.7-inch iPhone SE is even cheaper while offering a faster processor. But based on my iPhone XR review, Apple's big-screen phone is worth buying for those on a budget.Some may want to wait for the iPhone 13 to see what Apple has to offer this fall, but those phones will likely have a much more premium price. The iPhone XR gives you pretty much everything you could want in an affordable phone with minimal trade-offs. The iPhone XR went on sale Oct. 26, 2018. It now starts at $499 for 64GB of storage, and it's available through Apple and all of the major U.S. carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. You can also buy the iPhone XR through US Cellular and Xfinity, as well as through retailers such as Best Buy and Sam's Club.If you think most iPhones look too conservative, the iPhone XR will change your mind. Apple achieved a look that's fun yet elegant via a seven-layer color process.The glass backs are available in black, white, blue, yellow, coral and red. I'm partial to the cerulean blue. All of these hues have color-matched aluminum bands, which blend together with the back seamlessly. I've also been spending some time with the yellow and coral models. The yellow isn't as bright as the photos would have you believe; it's more of a lemony yellow.Again, as a phone snob, I can't help but notice that the bezels are slightly thicker on the iPhone XR than on the iPhone XS, but typical users won't care. The TrueDepth camera is up front, along with the notch, to help you log in via Face ID, as well as have fun with Animoji and Memoji and capture portrait selfies.If you'll allow me to geek out for a moment, OLED screens are much easier to manipulate than LCDs, so it's a pretty impressive feat that Apple was able to deliver a near full-screen design on the LCD-based iPhone XR that curves toward the edges.Apple pulled this off through a combination of precision milling, advanced pixel masking and subpixel anti-aliasing. That means that the very edges of the screen that look like bezels are actually part of the display and are made to look black.In terms of ruggedness, the front of the iPhone XR has the same durable glass as the iPhone XS, but the back is not as tough, so you may want to get an iPhone XR case. The iPhone XR is IP67 water-resistant, which means it can withstand 1 meter of water for 30 minutes, compared to 2 meters for the same amount of time for the IP68-rated iPhone XS.If you need to repair a cracked screen on the iPhone XR, it costs $199/£196.44 if you don't have AppleCare+. It costs $29/£25 if you do pay for AppleCare+ service, which for the iPhone XR is $149/£149.I've been switching between the 5.8-inch iPhone XS and the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max over the last month, so the 6.1-inch iPhone XR feels just right to me. It's big enough to deliver the immersive experience smartphone buyers want these days for Netflix bingeing, Instagramming and gaming, but it's not so big that it's unwieldy.The design will take some adjustment for those stepping up from a puny, 4.7-inch iPhone 7 but not those stepping up from an iPhone 7 Plus. That's because Apple squeezed a bigger display into a design about the same size as the iPhone 7 Plus by banishing the Home button.As you might expect, the iPhone XR's size and weight (6.8 ounces, 5.9 x 3 x 0.3 inches) is in between that of the iPhone XS (6.2 ounces, 5.7 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches) and that of the XS Max (7.3 ounces, 6.2 x 3.1 x 0.3 inches). Google's Pixel 3 XL (6.5 ounces, 6.2 x 3 x 0.3 inches), with its 6.3-inch screen, is a bit lighter but noticeably taller than the iPhone XR.It's worth noting that the Galaxy S10e delivers a colorful design in a more compact package, as it sports a smaller 5.8-inch display.The iPhone XR's 6.1-inch Liquid Retina LCD is one of the brighter and more colorful smartphone displays out there. It's just not OLED-great. On the plus side, the 1792 x 828-pixel screen delivered excellent detail when I watched the trailer for Aquaman, as I could make out every scale in his superhero uniform. (Yes, even though this panel is not technically full HD.) And the laser beams being shot at Amber Heard were an intense blue.This LCD fared well in our lab tests as well. It registered an excellent 589 nits of brightness, and I had no trouble reading this screen in direct sunlight. That number blows away the Pixel 3 XL's 362 nits. The iPhone XS (606 nits) and Galaxy Note 9 (604 nits) are even brighter, though. The Galaxy S10e hit 603 nits.The iPhone XR's screen registered a good 123.4 percent of the sRGB color gamut, which is on par with the iPhone XS's result (123 percent) but is behind showings from the Pixel 3 XL (170.2 percent) and Galaxy Note 9 (224 percent). The Galaxy S10e registered 148 percent.The color accuracy is great, too, as the iPhone XR turned in a Delta-E score of 0.28 (0 is perfect). That beats results from the Pixel 3 XL (0.35) and Note 9 (0.34) and is comparable to the iPhone XS' showing (0.25). The Galaxy S10e was behind at 0.57.What you don't get on the iPhone XR's screen are the perfect blacks and ultrawide viewing angles that OLED displays offer. I noticed the difference when I put the iPhone XR and iPhone XS side by side with an aquarium screen saver. The OLED panel is just more vibrant, and blacks can look more gray on an LCD.The iPhone XR's display doesn't offer 3D Touch capability like the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max do, which means you can't long-press on apps on the home screen to reveal shortcuts. But the XR does support what's called Haptic Touch, which delivers haptic feedback and a lot of the same functionality.So, instead of deep-pressing to launch the camera from the lock screen, you long-press with a soft touch. And instead of pressing hard anywhere on the keyboard to control the cursor while you're typing, you just long-press gently on the space bar. This change took some getting used to for me after I'd been using 3D Touch-capable phones, but overall, I don't think most iPhone owners will notice the difference between Haptic Touch and 3D Touch.With wider stereo sound, the iPhone XR's dual speakers delivered excellent audio quality when streaming Post Malone's ""Better Now."" The vocals and instruments were rich and full, so good that my family told me to keep it down. More importantly, there's a true volume boost over the iPhone X, which I appreciated when getting turn-by-turn directions via Google Maps while I was driving. I could even hear the directions over my car stereo played at moderate volume.If you're worried that the single-lens iPhone XR won't capture photos that are as good as those from the dual-lens iPhone XS and XS Max, you can stop worrying now. This phone has the same stellar wide-angle camera sensor as its pricier siblings and the same Smart HDR functionality, which delivers better highlights in the shadows.You can even shoot Portrait mode shots with the rear lens, complete with artistic bokeh effect, but there's a catch: For now, the back camera can snap Portraits only of people, and if you try something else, the iPhone will tell you that it's waiting for a person to enter the frame. The Pixel 3 doesn't have that limitation.The good news is that the iPhone XR's people portraits look pretty convincing. Plus, the iOS 12.1 update lets you tweak the depth control in your portraits in real-time preview as you shoot, not just after the fact.Take this shot of my colleague Sherri. The street scene to her left is artfully blurred, and yet the edges of her jacket look crisp. The iPhone XR's camera delivered good results in uneven sunlight, though the left side of Sherri's face could be brighter. Just keep in mind that because the iPhone XR doesn't have a telephoto lens like the iPhone XS has, your results will look more zoomed out than they would on Apple's dual-camera phones.How about food? The iPhone XR took a more appetizing shot of this dessert than the Pixel 3 did. The raspberry on top is much brighter on the iPhone's photo, and the chocolate topper is more in focus.When shooting pink flowers, the iPhone XR's camera delivered less of a gradient in the color than the Galaxy Note 9 did, so I actually preferred the results from Samsung's phone.The Pixel 3 outperformed the iPhone XR on this shot of a lion in bright sunlight. There's more contrast in the Pixel 3's shot, and the shadows don't get lost. There's also a bit of lens flare in the iPhone XR's photo.Because the iPhone XR lacks the 2x optical zoom of the iPhone XS Max, I took this shot of the facade of the New York Public Library with the XR's digital zoom. As it turns out, the iPhone XR's image looks pretty sharp, though the text on the iPhone XS Max's photo is more defined and has better contrast when you zoom in further. Same thing goes for the stone figures to the left.To test low-light performance we took the iPhone XR and Pixel 3 XL into our video studio and shut off all the lights, leaving just a bit of light coming in from the hallway. The iPhone XR captured a brighter shot, making the Cappy hat, Unicorn Meat tin and white water bottle more visible. The Pixel 3 XL’s image was dimmer with more noise.The 7-MP front camera did an excellent job taking selfies. There's good detail in my blue-and-red checkered shirt, as well as in my hair, and the lamp post and street in the background are artfully blurred. Just as with the iPhone XS, you can tweak the depth effect and change lighting effects, although the Contour Light option made me look like I was wearing makeup.MORE: Pixel 3 vs. iPhone XS Camera Face-Off: Why Google WinsApple is also issuing a bug fix in iOS 12. 1 that can result in selfies with a so-called skin smoothing effect. According to The Verge, this was because the iPhone XR's and iPhone XS' Smart HDR feature was selecting the wrong base frame for the shot.No surprise here: The A12 Bionic processor in the iPhone XR is just as fast as those in the iPhone XS and XS Max, which means you're getting a phone that beats the best Android flagships for hundreds of dollars less. I enjoyed silky-smooth performance when playing the augmented reality puzzle game AR Blast, which has you shoot colored blocks in front of you. Plus, other people can join in on the AR action for multiplayer fun, something you can't do on Android (at least not yet).On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the iPhone XR scored 11,312, which is comparable to the scores from the iPhone XS Max (11,515) and iPhone XS (11,420). That beats scores from the Galaxy Note 9 (8,876) and OnePlus 6 (9,088) and blows past the Pixel 3 XL's result (7,684).The Galaxy S10e, which has a fast Snapdragon 855 processor, scored 10,513 on Geekbench 4.The iPhone XR also excelled in our video-editing test, taking just 40 seconds to convert a 4K clip to 1080p. That's only a second behind the iPhone XS and way faster than the Pixel 3 XL (2:42), Galaxy S9+ (2:32) and OnePlus 6 (3:45). The Galaxy S10e finished in 2:26.On 3DMark's Slingshot Extreme Unlimited test, which evaluates graphics performance, the iPhone XR notched 4,416. The Pixel 3 XL was just a bit behind, at 4,396, but the Galaxy Note 9 reached a higher 4,639.The iPhone XR pulled ahead in everyday tasks like opening apps, too. For example, it took the phone 12.3 seconds to open the Tekken fighting game, compared to 21 seconds for the PIxel 3 XL. The gap was a lot narrower on the Asphalt 9 racing game, with the iPhone taking 4.98 seconds to the Pixel 3 XL's 6.4 seconds.While the iPhone XR doesn't support the fastest Gigabit LTE network standard that the iPhone XS and XS Max do, it delivered excellent data rates in our testing. On the Speedtet.net app, the iPhone XR averaged 58.4-Mbps downloads, compared to 58.2-Mbps down for the iPhone XS. However, the iPhone XS offered about double the upload speeds, at 25.4 Mbps versus 12.87 Mbps for the XR.One of the best reasons to choose the iPhone XR over the iPhone XS Max and XS is longer battery life.On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness, the iPhone XR lasted 11 hours and 26 minutes. That beats the times from the iPhone XS Max (10:38) and iPhone XS (9:41) by a significant margin.The Pixel 3 XL lasted only 9:30, while the Galaxy Note 9 also endured for 11:26. The Galaxy S10e endured for 9:41.In everyday use the iPhone XR's endurance also impressed. After unplugging at 100 percent at 7 a.m., I used the phone intermittently to play games, check Facebook and email, and stream Spotify and capture photos and videos, and I still have 24 percent battery left at 9 p.m.Unfortunately, Apple once again doesn’t offer fast USB-C charging on this phone. You’ll have to pay about $50/£50 for a USB-C charger and USB-C to Lightning adapter if you want to get to 50 percent in 30 minutes. The iPhone XR does support wireless charging.The iPhone XR runs iOS 14. The top features of iOS 14 include widgets on the home screen to give you more info at a glance, as well as App Library for automatically organizing your apps. Other enhancements include compact incoming call notifications (so they don't take over your whole screen, picture in picture, pinned conversations in Messages, a Translate app and more.The iPhone XR remains a good value, but there are reasons to consider stepping up to the iPhone 11. The iPhone 11 has a more durable design with tougher glass and a faster A13 Bionic processor, but the biggest reason to opt for the iPhone 11 over the iPhone XR is its new camera system.The iPhone 11's camera takes much better pictures in low light and has a sophisticated Night Mode that takes stellar shots. On the other hand, the iPhone 11 starts at $599, so if you want to keep the price low on your next phone the $499 iPhone XR is still a good buy.For more info see our iPhone XR vs iPhone 11 face-off.Our iPhone SE vs iPhone XR face-off has more details, but here's the gist if you're on the fence between these two phones. The cheaper $399 iPhone SE is faster, thanks to its A13 Bionic processor, and that same chip enables several photography features, including Portrait mode for the rear and front cameras and Smart HDR. The iPhone XR makes due with an older A12 Bionic chip.On the other hand, the iPhone XR has a larger display than the iPhone SE (6.1 inches vs 4.7 inches), longer battery life and Face ID. The iPhone SE uses a Touch ID sensor. The iPhone XR has shockingly few trade-offs compared to pricier iPhones. You get a big and bright display, very good cameras, fast performance and long battery life for a very affordable price. Overall, we prefer the newer iPhone 12 because of its better cameras, OLED display and 5G, but if you're on a budget you should be very happy with the iPhone XR.A tougher choice is between the $499 iPhone XR and even cheaper $399 iPhone SE 2020. The iPhone XR offers a larger screen and Face ID, but the new iPhone SE has a faster A13 Bionic chip and better cameras in a more compact design. See our iPhone XR vs iPhone SE face-off for more info.Some may want to wait to see if Apple launches a new iPhone SE 3, but that's apparently not being launched this year. And while the iPhone 13 is on the way this fall, we expect prices to continue to start at $799. Overall, the iPhone XR is one of the best iPhones out there if you don't want to pay a flagship premium.Credit: Tom's Guide"
17,iPhone 12,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-12,"Price: $729 unlocked; $699 on contract OS: iOS 14 Display: 6.1-inch OLED (2532x1170) CPU: A14 Bionic Storage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB Rear camera: 12MP wide (ƒ/1.6), 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 12MP (ƒ/2.2) Battery: 2,815 mAh Battery life: 8:25 (5G), 10:23 (4G) Size: 5.78 x 2.81 x 0.29 inches Weight: 5.78 ouncesThe iPhone 12 is one of best iPhone values around now that it has a discounted price of $699. It's still among the best phones you can buy overall, offering an attractive design, full 5G connectivity, good cameras and better performance than any Android phone. Even before the iPhone 13 appeared, the iPhone 12 was far from perfect perfect. A low amount of base storage and the lack of a charger included in box means this iPhone isn’t as affordable as it initially seems. Additionally, some of the best features in the Android realm — like the powerful digital zoom and fast-refresh rate displays of the Samsung Galaxy S21 — are missing in action here.The iPhone 12 mini is worth a look if you want something cheaper and smaller, and the iPhone 12 Pro series is better if you want a telephoto lens. But the regular iPhone 12 gets our nod for being a great all-around phone. See our iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 12 comparison for more info.Our full iPhone 12 review below shows why this phone is still very much worth your consideration. The iPhone 12 was released in October of 2021 and it remains available from Apple as well as a number of carriers. The newly reduced price is $699 for 64GB of storage. Upping that to 128GB costs $749 and 246GB costs $849. In the U.K., the iPhone 12 now tarts at £679 for the 64GB model, but pay an extra £30 and you can get 128GB of storage for £849. The 256GB handset now costs £829.If you want the lowest price,  we continue to track iPhone 12 deals for all of Apple's phones. You can save anywhere from $110 to $790 on an iPhone 12 when you buy from Apple and trade-in your current iPhone, assuming you've got an iPhone 8 or later. (Newer models fetch the highest return.)Apple isn’t shipping a charging adapter or headphones in box with the iPhone 12, so you'll need to pay extra if you need one.Apple rarely alters the physical design of the iPhone from generation to generation, and thus any change — no matter how small — is typically received with enthusiasm. You can chalk up the iPhone 12’s new flat-edge aesthetic as one of those more modest revisions.Sure, the flat edges look nice enough and offer a much appreciated change of pace from the last several consecutive years of rounded iPhones. What’s more, they improve the iPhone 12’s durability in tandem with Apple’s new Ceramic Shield material, as the rounded frames of previous iPhones actually made them more fragile.We will be conducting our own drop tests, but the Ceramic Shield display held up well in EverythingApplePro's torture test on YouTube. Both the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro did not crack at hip or shoulder height when dropped, and the display on the regular iPhone 12 didn't even crack from 10 feet, though the back did. All that said, I can’t say my hands have really taken to the sharper design. Few smartphones employ flat sides these days, and the iPhone 12 reminds me why. The edges dig into your palm, and make the entire device a bit harder to grip. For example, the iPhone 12 measures 0.29 inches thick — which is perceptibly identical to the 0.31-inch-thick Pixel 5. However, the Pixel 5 feels more slender in the hand, because it naturally fits the curvature of your palm.Additionally — and I won’t blame you for dismissing this as a nitpick — as a longtime iPhone 11 Pro user, I can’t help but feel the 6.1-inch iPhone 12 is a hair taller than it really needs to be. I find the 5.8-inch size the perfect compromise between display real estate and pocketability, but with the iPhone 12 series, Apple has left that form factor to die. Now, those who desire a more compact device will have no choice but to go for the 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini. And though I commend Apple for making a small flagship phone in the year of our lord 2020, I can’t help but feel a 5.4-inch display might be a bit too tiny for modern users.Nevertheless, I’m generally smitten by the iPhone 12’s design. I like that Apple’s shaved down the bezels considerably compared to the iPhone 11 and XR, though a slightly reduced notch would have been appreciated. And while I’m not a huge fan of the new blue color — I find this sort of navy a bit dull — I like the mint green on offer, and I especially like the elegant simplicity of this design. The iPhone 12 comes three other colors — black, white and red.The iPhone 12 feels substantial and premium, and not necessarily any less luxurious than the iPhone 12 Pro. You even get the same caliber of IP68 water resistance here as in the Pro (20 feet for 30 minutes) which far exceeds other handsets on the market, as well as the aforementioned crystal-infused Ceramic Shield material protecting the display, which Apple estimates is four times less likely to shatter when dropped — a claim we look forward to testing ourselves soon.While the miracle of magnets continues to baffle the world’s top minds, Apple has made them a fundamental aspect of the iPhone 12’s design. A ring of magnets centrally placed on the back of the iPhone 12 enable Apple’s new MagSafe ecosystem of accessories, from wireless chargers to cases and wallet attachments that simply snap on and off.There’s nothing inherently unique about Apple’s brand of wireless charging here. The company’s own $30 MagSafe charging puck uses the very same Qi standard as any other wireless charger for any other phone — it just incorporates magnets, too. Your iPhone 12 will still be compatible with whatever wireless chargers or Qi accessories you already have, though to get those peak 15-watt speeds, you'll need a first- or third-party solution that incorporates MagSafe.The bad news is that MagSafe is slower than Apple's 20W wired charger. Much slower. In a third-party charging test, the iPhone 12 charges to 50% full in 28 minutes using the 20W fast charger. The 15W MagSafe charger took an hour.Still, that’s not to discredit the philosophy behind MagSafe, which makes a lot of sense. The magnets help localize the iPhone 12 on chargers and makes accessory attachment more convenient. And it’s surely easier to top off your phone by setting it down a puck that instantly aligns itself perfectly, rather than fumbling around at your bedside to plug in a tiny Lightning connector.I think it’s going to take more third-party involvement and experimentation before we really see MagSafe reach its full potential. Case in point, Apple’s leather wallet attachment. It’s a clever idea, and I have no doubt some iPhone owners will love it. But the magnets within the iPhone 12 aren’t quite strong enough to keep the wallet rigidly attached in all instances. In fact, the friction of pulling the iPhone 12 out of my jeans pocket was enough to knock the wallet off center on a few occasions, which to me doesn’t evoke very Apple-like design.The iPhone 11’s LCD display has unquestionably been the Achilles' heel of Apple’s entry-level premium iPhones in recent years, but the iPhone 12 alleviates that. It’s all thanks to a new 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display that matches what you get in the iPhone 12 Pro.This panel packs a 2532x1170 resolution, making for a dramatic increase in the clarity of on-screen content compared to the iPhone 11’s dated 1792x898 display. It’s also HDR10 rated, allowing you to watch any videos recorded with the device’s Dolby Vision-equipped rear camera the way they were intended to be seen.Watching the trailer for the upcoming Monster Hunter film that really looks as though it never should have been made, I at least came away pleased by the fidelity of the scales, horns and teeth on a Black Diablos glinting in the desert sun. The black smoke from an explosion also contrasted heavily against the otherwise bright daylight scene in a way that wouldn’t have looked nearly as alluring on the iPhone 11’s LCD panel, with its inability to display true black.The iPhone 12’s screen still isn’t perfect, and the reason why is clear to anyone who has used a recent Galaxy, Pixel or OnePlus phone for any length of time. Following months of rumors suggesting the opposite, Apple decided to forgo high refresh-rate displays on the entire iPhone 12 line, which have actually become quite common in the flagship smartphone space over the past year.As a result, animations aren’t as smooth and taps and scrolls don’t respond with the same immediacy on Apple’s latest handsets as they do on, say, the 90Hz Pixel 5 or 120Hz Galaxy S20. Even though the iPhone 12 is more powerful than those devices — as we’ll soon see later in the review — it feels slower to use at times, simply because the display isn’t as athletic. And that’s something Apple should surely attempt to rectify by the time the iPhone 13 becomes reality.In terms of brightness, under our light meter the iPhone 12 topped out at 569 nits at its highest setting, which actually falls considerably short of Apple’s 625-nit estimate. It was able to render 114.5% of the sRGB color space — just shy of the 122.8% of the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 — indicating slightly more restrained and natural hues, rather than oversaturation.Looking to the Delta-E color accuracy test, the iPhone 12 scored a result of 0.29, which is surprisingly a bit worse than the iPhone 11’s 0.22 result. (Numbers closer to zero indicate more accurate hues.) Nevertheless, colors seemed appropriate to my eye, and the switch to OLED alone makes this a massive leap compared to the previous generation, generally speaking.Judging from the outside, you wouldn’t think a whole lot has changed in the camera department for the iPhone 12. The dual-lens rear shooters are arranged in a similar fashion as they were for 2019, and both of the wide and ultrawide optics are backed by 12-megapixel sensors.Don’t let your eyes deceive you, however, as upgrades have been made. The primary camera in particular now benefits from a new 7-element design with an ƒ/1.6 aperture, the largest yet in an iPhone. The upshot of both of these changes is a 27% improvement in low-light performance, which, coupled with advancements to Smart HDR and Deep Fusion, should translate to more detail in even the least favorable conditions.So let’s begin, then, with a couple of Night Mode shots that illustrate what a year’s worth of improvements have done for the iPhone’s low-light performance. Both of these photos make for dramatic, stunning night scenes, but the iPhone 12’s rendition is slightly sharper across the board, with more lifelike hues inside the shadow-clad brick and better sensitivity to specular highlights, evident in the way the brick picks up the light from the lamps above. Still, the iPhone 11 Pro doesn’t lose out by much at all to the newer handset.That said, Apple’s got some work to do. Google looks to have the upper hand at night, judging by how the iPhone 12’s best work compares to the Pixel 5’s in the example above. While Apple’s software emboldens object boundaries, giving everything in the frame a tinge more depth, Google’s algorithms deliver a universally more visible result, in tandem with far less overall noise. There’s some ugly vignetting going on around the edges of the iPhone 12’s shot that plainly isn’t there in the Pixel’s shot.In daylight, the iPhone 12’s main camera gives you little to complain about. While the Note 20 painted this idyllic lakeside scene a bit more sharply, particularly within the distant trees, I largely prefer the iPhone 12’s attempt for its more realistic treatment of colors, from the deep blue mid-afternoon sky to the yellows, oranges and greens encircling the water. Samsung once again went overboard with post-processing here, as it has a habit of doing.When we zoom into that fountain off to the right, though, the iPhone 12’s limitations become painfully obvious. There’s no optical zoom on offer with the iPhone 12 — for that, you have to spend more on the iPhone 12 Pro or Pro Max. But even then, you wouldn’t get the same crystal clarity provided by the Note 20’s 3x hybrid zoom, which nails the beads of water, the ripples on the lake’s surface and the wall of trees in the background.Here we see the very same lake, now viewed through the ultrawide lenses of the iPhone 12 and $749 OnePlus 8T. Both of these shots fall astray in different respects; the iPhone 12 bungles the white balance, producing a green cast in the water and clouds, while the OnePlus 8T’s photo just isn’t sharp enough at all, and heavily distorts the image along the perimeter.Rounding out this fall-themed photo op is a pair of portraits of my colleague Jesse, taken with the iPhone 12 and Pixel 5. Interestingly, the iPhone 12 defaults to a more pulled-out perspective for portraits than the Pixel 5, which automatically applies some cropping.Still, the iPhone 12’s version still looks a bit sharper to my eye, with better treatment of Jesse’s skin tone, and Smart HDR deftly managing the contrast between the deep shadows blanketing his right shoulder and the rest of his hoodie. The iPhone 12 also applies a more precise bokeh around Jesse’s hair and ears, which is often the challenge of simulated shallow depth-of-field portraits like these.To test out the capabilities of Apple’s Deep Fusion mode, which favors scenes with granular details in medium-light scenarios, I used the iPhone 12 and Pixel 5 to grab a shot of a painting on canvas. Deep Fusion is designed to composite various exposures of different lengths for optimal sharpness, but I was surprised to find Google’s handset actually generated the most precise output here, drawing the hatchwork texture of the canvas with a crispness the iPhone 12 couldn’t quite match. However, I think the iPhone’s treatment of colors at large — and the warmth it lends to the reds, whites and the neutral-toned background — ultimately results in a more appealing image.A better example of Deep Fusion at work may be this selfie I took as the sun was going down, where the iPhone 12 rendered the individual fibers in my sweater with richness and nuance compared to the Note 20’s blurry output. The iPhone 12’s 12MP front-facing camera unsurprisingly captures more detail than the Note 20’s 10MP sensor, but Apple’s algorithms also don’t uncannily over-brighten shadows and drain contrast from my face like Samsung’s do. If I was forced to post one of these to Instagram, the choice wouldn’t be difficult.Overall, the iPhone 12 lands among the top tier of its price bracket where camera performance is concerned, but it’s not the best in every scenario. For night shots, I’d still rather have a Pixel, which can paint the same challenging scenes with less noise. And if I was working from a distance, I’d rather have the Pixel 5 as well for its superior digital Super Res Zoom, or one of Samsung’s devices — either the Galaxy S20 FE or the Note 20 — for their 3x optical and hybrid zoom systems.Apple has gone all in on 4K HDR video recording with the iPhone 12 line. Like the iPhone 12 and Pro Max, the regular iPhone 12 (and the smaller iPhone 12 mini) can record Dolby Vision video, albeit only at 30 frames per second to the Pro models’ 60. Dolby Vision is a type of HDR encoding that goes beyond the standard HDR10 format to provide superior color depth, while ensuring a consistent visual presentation as closely aligned to the source material as possible, no matter where or how the content is viewed.It may be hard to visualize, but trust us on this one — the difference is immediately clear when observing the same content side-by-side in HDR and SDR. I recorded a short video in a park as the sun descended behind the trees, and the gap in contrast in each instance was eye-opening. For one, the sky was markedly brighter in the Dolby Vision capture, and I could actually make out individual leaves and trees reflecting the sun. These aspects were faded, washed out and obscured in the SDR take, and as someone who has been using an iPhone 11 Pro for video for the better part of a year, I had no idea what I’d been missing.Now, to be fair, the iPhone 12 is far from the only smartphone out there that can shoot HDR video. However, it is the only Dolby Vision-certified one, and I can definitely say that HDR video I’ve shot on our Galaxy S20 Plus has never looked anywhere near as good unedited as what the iPhone 12 churns out by default.Lots of smartphones today support 5G, and you don’t even really need to pay more for the privilege anymore. However, Apple’s philosophy toward 5G is what distinguishes the iPhone 12 from all other 5G phones.Whereas the vast majority of 5G handsets support one kind of 5G and not another, or only the specific bands necessary to work on a certain network, the iPhone 12 goes all out. It is built to run on the most bands of any 5G phone, which means a greater chance of 5G coverage, especially in these spotty early days of the technology. What’s more, the iPhone 12 works on both sub-6GHz 5G — the nationwide 5G that has formed the backbone of T-Mobile and AT&T’s service as of yet — in addition to much faster and shorter-range millimeter-wave 5G, like what Verizon has focused on deploying in America’s cities.This dual-pronged approach to 5G is critical, because it means when 5G eventually does become ubiquitous, your 5G-capable iPhone won’t be hamstrung with a modem that only supports some networks and not others. Mind you, that day could be far off in the distance; on AT&T’s network in a Pennsylvania suburb, I tended to see downloads in the neighborhood of 85 Mbps on our iPhone 12 while pulling a two-bar signal. That’s serviceable, but only about as third as quick as the fastest LTE Advanced networks we’ve tested.5G does increase demand on the iPhone’s battery, however, and so to that end, Apple has developed Smart Data Mode. This feature intelligently switches between LTE and 5G depending on whether or not the device really needs the extra speed. For example, if you’re simply streaming music over Spotify with the screen off, your iPhone 12 may elect to remain on 4G to save power. But the second you begin actively web browsing or attempting a FaceTime HD call, 5G will kick in in full effect. Smart Data Mode is totally optional; if you'd rather have 5G firing at all times, you can deem it so in the phone’s settings.Armed with the first 5-nanometer processor ever embedded in a smartphone — Apple’s new A14 Bionic — the iPhone 12 delivers best-in-class performance that never wavers. The A13 Bionic chip in the iPhone 11 series was already faster than Qualcomm’s top-tier 2020 silicon, the Snapdragon 865 Plus, but the A14 extends that gap further still. Now that it's 2021, however, we're starting to see more Snapdragon 888 phones, including the Galaxy S21 series.Most phones need about a minute or more to complete our video encoding test, where a short 4K video is transcoded to 1080p using Adobe’s Premiere Rush app. The iPhone 11 Pro needed 46 seconds to complete this task; the 888-equipped Galaxy S21 Ultra, 1 minute and 2 seconds. The iPhone 12, though? Just 26 seconds.The Geekbench 5 test, which measures overall system performance, shows a similar advantage for Apple’s newest CPU. Here, the iPhone 12 set a blistering pace with a score of 3,859 in the multicore portion of the benchmark. The Galaxy S21 Ultra garnered 3,440 points.And Apple hasn’t skimped on the graphics side of things, either. Apple says the GPU inside the A14 Bionic is 50% faster than the one in the A13. While the latest mobile games don’t always take full advantage of phone makers’ rapid innovation, I can say that Asphalt 9 Legends — a game that can occasionally be chuggy on some higher-end Android phones — felt smooth and sharp on the iPhone 12. (Of course, a faster refresh-rate display would have heightened the illusion of responsiveness and immersion, but that’s another issue.)A better measure of performance is 3DMark’s Wild Life graphics benchmark, which tasks devices with rendering complex, taxing scenes in real-time. The Galaxy S21 Ultra tops out at 34 fps in this test. The iPhone 12 hit 39 fps in our testing.Apple never reveals battery capacity figures for its devices, which makes it challenging to glean any insights regarding longevity from a spec sheet. A recent teardown suggests the iPhone 12 could be working with a 2,815-mAh unit, which translates to roughly 200 mAh less capacity than the iPhone 11 Pro had at its disposal. Nevertheless, larger screen iPhones tend to perform decently in our custom battery test, where devices continuously surf the web over cellular at 150 nits of screen brightness.For a bit of perspective, the iPhone 11 tallied 11 hours and 16 minutes in this test, and we deem anything over the 11 hour mark to be very good. The iPhone 12, however, averaged 8 hours and 25 minutes in the very same test, which would appear to be a significant decrease.However, there is a deeper story here. Like the iPhone 11, Apple rates the iPhone 12 for an identical 17 hours of video playback, along with 65 hours of audio. However, the iPhone 11 didn’t have 5G to contend with. And when we ran our test again with 5G switched off in favor of LTE, the iPhone 12 performed better — a lot better.The iPhone 12 lasted 10 hours and 23 minutes on 4G — two hours longer than its 5G time. If we had to guess, the culprit could be that 5G consumes more power, or that the limited span of 5G networks makes it difficult for the iPhone 12 to maintain a consistent 5G connection, forcing it to switch back and forth between 5G and 4G. It could very well be a combination of both factors, as we noticed some switching in our testing, but ultimately it’s too early to conclusively say what the culprits are.The battery story gets a bit worse as we approach the elephant in the room — Apple’s decision to forgo a charging brick and wired headphones with every iPhone going forward.Say what you like about how much of this can be chalked up to Cupertino’s environmental initiative, but the fact of the matter is that this will leave prospective iPhone buyers without the fastest-charging solution for the iPhone 12 unless they shell out an additional $20 for Apple’s 20-watt USB-C adapter. And, to add insult to injury, the Lightning-to-USB-C cable that Apple does pack in with the iPhone 12 won’t work with older chargers, and won’t be of much use to you unless you buy a new brick.The charger situation is the same for U.K. buyers, with Apple wanting £39 for the MagSafe charger and £19 for the wired 20-watt charging block.In our testing, the new 20-watt adapter got the iPhone 12 from empty to 57% in 30 minutes. That exceeds Apple's own 50% estimate, though you assuredly won’t see that kind of speed if you depend on your old 5-watt brick from iPhones of yore to charge your new device. The iPhone 12 can also now charge wirelessly at a peak speed of 15 watts, which is noticeably better than Apple’s lethargic old 7.5-watt mandate.As you'll see in our iOS 15 review, Apple's OS delivers some welcome improvements to your iPhone, many of which focus on shared experiences. FaceTime will let you listen to music or watch movies or TV shows with friends or family. And the Messages app delivers a new Shared with You section for photos, articles and more.A new Focus feature in iOS 15 lets you filter notifications based on what you’re doing. And notifications themselves have been refined, complete with a new summary view. Other iOS 15 highlights include a redesigned Safari and an enhanced Maps app with more detail and better road views.Live Text bites is similar to Google Lens, as it recognizes text in real time via the camera when you want to look things up or get translations.I’m of two minds about the iPhone 12. There’s no question this is a great phone overall, and many of the changes Apple has made to its most popular iPhone are for the better. The new Super Retina XDR panel is a phenomenal improvement over the disappointing LCD panels in previous models at this price, even if it lacks a high refresh rate. And the design, MagSafe system and excellent dual-camera system all earn the iPhone 12 high marks.But Apple’s resistance to change in key areas is still disappointing. Practically every major phone maker has stopped being stingy with base storage. The fact the iPhone 12 still only starts with 64GB is borderline criminal, especially in light of the iPhone 13's expanded storage. Some may opt for the iPhone 13 instead, even though the iPhone 12 costs $100 less. The new iPhone delivers delivers faster performance, better cameras, and a smaller notch. But nearly a year after its arrival, the iPhone 12 is still very much worth buying."
18,Samsung Galaxy S21,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s21,"OS: Android 11 with One UI 3 Screen size: 6.2 inches (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 48-120Hz Processor: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB microSD: none Rear cameras: 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultra-wide (f/2.2), 64MP telephoto (f/2.0) with 3x hybrid zoom/30x digital Video: Up to 8K at 24 fps Front cameras: 10MP Battery: 4,000 mAh Battery life: 9 hours and 53 minutes (60hz), 6 hours and 31 minutes (adaptive) Charging: 25W (charger not included) Colors: Phantom Violet, Phantom Pink, Phantom White, Phantom Gray Size: 5.97 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches Weight: 5.95 ouncesFor years, the Galaxy S series have been do-everything, have-everything flagship phones. But with the Galaxy S21, Samsung has decided to take away almost as much as it’s upgraded. What could be a recipe for failure has actually yielded an excellent Android smartphone that’s $200 cheaper than the Galaxy S20. With its 6.2-inch display, trio of rear cameras, and the same 4,000 mAh battery, the Galaxy S21 isn’t much of an upgrade over its predecessor. Sure, it comes with a new camera module and colour schemes, as well as Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888. But the Galaxy S21 turns out to be very much an iterative upgrade; the big changes come in the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra this time around. Yet there's a lot more to this take-away tale. Keep reading our Samsung Galaxy S21 review to find out why removing stuff has worked out rather well for Samsung’s new flagship phone.You can buy the Samsung Galaxy S21 right now, either by itself or via a carrier contract. In the U.S., for a starting price of $799 you can get the Galaxy S21 with 128GB of storage, but fork out an extra $50 and you can get the 256GB model for $849. That’s $200 cheaper than the Galaxy S20 cost a year ago — quite the saving. In the U.K. the Samsung Galaxy S21 starts at £769 for the 128GB model, with double the storage setting you back £819. The 5G Galaxy S20 came in at £899, so the S21 is £130 cheaper.   Just bear in mind, there’s only a USB-C cable in the box, so you’ll need to pay out for a charger if you don’t have one already. And the S21 only comes with 8GB of RAM, with no option to get the 12GB of the Galaxy S20, unless you opt for the considerably more expensive Galaxy S21 Ultra. The Samsung Galaxy S21 undercuts its most obvious rival the iPhone 12, which costs $879 for a handset with 128GB. (The $799 iPhone 12 only offers 64GB of storage.) But the S21 is more expensive than the $699 Google Pixel 5, which is a little lacking in raw specs but offers a fantastic camera. Somewhat ironically, the reasonably recent Samsung Galaxy S20 FE could be a threat to the Galaxy S21 as it offers a 120Hz display, a still powerful Snapdragon 865, and a trio of solid rear cameras for $699. The S20 FE isn’t as advanced as the S21, but it still has a lot going for it for a sub flagship price.From the front, the Galaxy S21 looks alot like the Galaxy S20, with its 6.2-inch display complete with a neat punch-hole selfie camera in the top middle of the screen. Look closer and you’ll see the S21 has dropped its predecessor's curved display and opted for flat edges.This might sound like a downgrade, given the new phone doesn't look quiet as sleek, but I’m fine with it. I think curved screens on Android phones with displays under 6.5 inches tend to be a little slippery to hold, especially as you can mostly use them one-handed; large handsets tend to feel a bit more comfortable with curved edges when you’re performing finger gymnastics to reach apps on the display’s far side.The flat edges on the Samsung Galaxy S21 lead to the metal edges flowing to the new “Contour Cut” camera design, where the rear camera module seems to blend into the S21’s left-hand edge, as well as the back.Speaking of which, the metal gives way to what’s arguably the Samsung Galaxy S21’s biggest change: a plastic back. Samsung calls it polycarbonate but it's basically fancy plastic, whereas the S20 makes use of glass.Opting for a plastic back is likely the biggest reason Samsung can offer the Galaxy S21 at its cheaper price. And while the lack of a glass back might seem odd for a flagship phone, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn’t feel cheap. Not only do I think it feels a little nicer than the polycarbonate on the S20 FE’s rear, it also has a more tactile finish than the glass-backed Galaxy S series, making it feel less likely to escape your grip or suck up fingerprints. Personally, I’m happy to pocket the savings if this helps keep costs down.And the Phantom Violet S21 I had to review looks fantastic, even if the name sounds a little daft. The violet panel has a pleasantly soft hue, while the faint copper color of the camera bump and edges give the S21 a pseudo retro sci-fi look; think Star Trek meets Art Deco.Three other color options — Phantom Gray, Phantom Pink, Phantom White — are available but I've yet to see them in the metal and plastic.Measuring 6 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches and weighing 6.07 ounces, the Galaxy S21 is a bit smaller yet a little heavier than the Galaxy S20 (5.9 x 3 x 0.31, 5.7 ounces). But I think it is the ideal size and weight for one-hand use; small enough for my thumb to reach two-thirds of the display, but large enough to sit down and watch hours of videos on. The Galaxy S21’s in-display ultrasonic fingerprint reader is also more responsive thanks to using Qualcomm’s new scanner, which is 1.7x larger and 50% faster than the previous generation. I found the S21 rarely rejected a hasty tap from my thumb, which does wonders for my quick-temper.What’s not ideal is the Galaxy S21 dropped the microSD card slot its predecessors have sported for a while. I’m not sure why Samsung did this, as there’s no obvious limitations of space inside the Galaxy S21, nor would I expect its removal to change manufacturing costs by much. Perhaps it's one way for Samsung to encourage people to buy the 265GB version, though with so many free cloud storage services, I’m ultimately not too fussed about the lack of expandable storage.Samsung has both downgraded and upgraded the Galaxy S21’s 6.2-inch AMOLED display from what the S20 previously featured. You no longer have to choose between a full HD+ resolution running at 120Hz or a QHD running at 60Hz, like you did with the Galaxy S20, but that’s because the S21 tops out at 1080p resolution.While that’s more restrictive, I feel it removes complexity. You can go and set the display to stick to 60Hz, if you want to eek out as much battery life as possible, or you just love a bit of judder when scrolling through web pages. But then you’d be given up a dynamic refresh rate, which allows the S21 to drop its refresh rate from 120Hz to 48Hz depending on the task at hand. It’s not an upgrade you’ll necessarily notice when you’re not scrolling, but it's a smart one that quietly makes the S21 more enjoyable to use. Testing its “natural” screen setting, the Galaxy S21 display delivers 109.2% sRGB and 77.4% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage, and a Delta-E of 0.29. Those are good scores, though the iPhone 12 and the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra beat the S21 in terms of coverage and color accuracy. However, in practical use the Galaxy S21’s display is fantastic. Stick it in “Vivid” mode and you’ll see heaps of contrast and color, even if the latter errs on the side of oversaturation. The display is great for watching videos and movies, ogling Instagram pics, and playing games on. Samsung has long had excellent displays on its Galaxy S phones, and the S21 is no exception.Hardware-wise, the Galaxy S21 cameras are exactly the same as the Galaxy S20. The triple camera array comprises a main 12MP wide-angle lens, a 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 64MP telephoto lens with 3x hybrid optic zoom and 30x space zoom.But Samsung is pulling a Google and leaning hard on software and computational photography upgrades to improve the trio of rear cameras. And for the most part, the Galaxy S21 achieves this. Let’s start with the standard photo mode. Take a look at the photo below; with multiple colors and shades to deal with, plus the light coming in from the left, it presents a smartphone camera workout. The Galaxy S21’s photo is flush with color and detail, though like Galaxy phones in the past, the colors are perhaps a little more saturated than those of the Google Pixel 5 I used for comparison. The Pixel 5 delivers a warmer tone and more true-to-life colors, with better dynamic range.However zooming in, the S21 picks out some finer details, likely due to its telephoto camera, with the grill on the model Aston Martin DB5 and the numbers on the Vox headphone amp clearer than in the Pixel 5’s photo. It’s worth noting I switched off the Scene Optimizer feature, which uses AI to identify what’s in-frame and adjust the camera accordingly to get the best shot. In practice, I feel this can result in some over-processing. Outdoors in natural light and the S21‘s main camera does a fine job. While it was hardly an ideal photography situation, in the shot below, the Galaxy S21 picks out more detail than the Pixel 5 in the tower buildings on the right and London's Canary Wharf in the background. However, the Pixel 5 offers more dynamic range and colors that are truer to life. Speaking of which, things get a little complicated in lower-light situations or environments lit by artificial light. I found the Pixel 5 was better at edge detection and resolving detail in low light areas, whereas the S21 occasionally throws up smudged and over-smoothed results. You really have to go looking for this though, and I believe it's down to the Galaxy S21 ramping up the ISO and introducing more noise into darker sections of a shot as a consequence. I suspect this could be some teething problems with the AI processing being applied to low-light areas, something which Samsung could fix with a software update. Poor light doesn't help the portrait mode either. Thanks to social distancing rules in the U.K. I had to snap a pic of my friend Claire on her doorstep as the sun went down; this meant there was the challenge of dealing with low light on one side and a porch light on the other. The Pixel 5 copes admirably, delivering more natural skin tones and picking out details in the highlights and the shadows. But S21 struggles a bit, washing out and over-smoothing Claire’s face. And it fails to pick out much detail in her hair especially on the left-hand side. Non-portrait S21 photos fare better, so I suspect the portrait mode’s algorithm is struggling to pick out what’s in the foreground and what should be blurred out; something the Pixel 5 is particularly good at. In better light conditions, the portrait mode is much better for both the rear and 10MP front-facing camera; take a look at the photo below of Tom’s Guide's Mark Spoonauer as an example.And shooting objects rather than faces sees the Galaxy S21 deliver a nice portrait photo.The Galaxy S21 doesn't deliver the sharpest of portrait mode cutouts like the Pixel 5, as Samsung opts for a more gradual blur effect. I prefer the clarity of Google’s handset but the S21 still gets some nice results. Switch over to the S21 night mode, and the low-light problems are swept away. In the shot below, the S21 delivers a bright image that's more detailed (notably in street lights) than the Pixel 5. With more cameras to use for capturing light and detail, the S21 shows up the limitations of the Pixel 5’s dual rear cameras. I prefer the colors the Pixel 5 offers, though. And the S21 seems to apply a good amount of sharpening to its night shots. Night mode can also be used across all three of the Galaxy S21’s cameras. Ultra-wide angle shots are expensive on the Galaxy S21, but once you zoom in  things come apart. While it captures a wider view than the Pixel 5, punching into a shot reveals hazy details, whereas Google’s phone is much clearer. You’ll have to weigh up whether a lack of fine detail is worth a more expensive photo. It’s with the telephoto camera’s 20x and 30x “Space Zoom” where the S21’s real camera upgrades come into play. Notably, the new Zoom Lock feature, which uses AI to identify the subject and steady the shot.This works rather well and you can get shots that are surprisingly clear for such extreme zooms, even if you have rather shaky hands. Then the processing afterward cleans up the photo and results in a zoomed shot that’s not a muddy mess. Using Space Zoom I could get a reasonably clear pic of a small mint tin on my window still from the other side of the room. I’m not sure how practical it is for every-day smartphone photography, but it’s an impressive showcase for AI tech. On the video front, the Galaxy S21 covers a lot of bases. Like the Galaxy S20 it offers up to 8K capture at 24 fps, which its overkill for most, but it lets you snap high-quality photos while recording very high resolution videos. Other high-end features include 1080p video recording at 120 fps, which makes them super-smooth. Speaking of smooth, the Super Steady mode, which uses AI to compensate for shaky recording, will works on 1080p 60 fps video capture. Another highlight is the new Director's View when you're shooting video. You can shoot using the front and rear cameras at the same time, as well as view live thumbnails from the multiple cameras. This makes it easier to switch to the best shot for your video. It works rather well and is less of a gimmick than I first thought. The portrait video, which is basically a renaming of live focus video, is also rather slick, delivering footage where the subjects are in focus while the background is blurred. If you move around a lot you can see the S21 working its algorithms, which results in sometimes over smoothing details on faces. Other camera upgrades include an improved Single Take feature that takes a bunch of stills and photos with a single tap. Single Take now delivers Highlight Video and Dynamic Slow-Mo clips.All the above taken into account, the Galaxy S21 delivers an upgrade over the Galaxy S20. I don’t think it has what it takes to knock the iPhone 12 Pro Max off our best phone cameras list and the iPhone 12 could still have it beat, But the S21 trades blows with the Pixel 5, and beats Google's phone in a lot of areas. Potential for further refinement on the AI and computational photography side by Samsung leaves plenty of scope for the S21s camera to get better over time.In the U.S, the Galaxy S21 comes with the latest Snapdragon 888 chip, which promises 20% better CPU performance, 35% more GPU speed, as well as boosted AI performance. Even though there's no 12GB of RAM option, the S21 does plenty with its 8GB, and I didn't encounter any slowdown in my testing. Speaking of which, putting the Snapdragon 888-equipped S21 through a series of benchmarks, saw the chip deliver a multi-core score of 3,302 in Geekbench 5. That’s slower than the iPhone 12, which raked in a score of 3,859. But the S21, unsurprisingly, outpaces a lot of other Android phones with the older Snapdragon 865.As for the graphics performance, the S21 topped out at 33 frames per second in 3DMark’s Wild Life graphics benchmark. It’s beaten by the iPhone 12’s 39 fps, but is ahead of other flagship Android phones. In practical use, though, the S21 chews through games. Both Call of Duty: Mobile and Asphalt 9 Legends ran smoothly at max settings, with the 120Hz refresh rate further adding to the smoothness. It’s worth noting that while we tested the Snapdragon 888 Galaxy S21, I was using a handset with the Exynos 2100. Built on a 5-nanometre process node like the Snapdragon 888, the Exynos 2100 is meant to deliver 20% improvement in energy efficiency and a 10% improvement in performance over the last-gen 7nm Exynos 990. Throwing the S2100 at Geekbench 5, it got a score of 3,391 so is on par with the Snapdragon chip, which is gratifying as Exynos chips have previously lagged behind. With those games open and a load of other apps running at the same time, I didn’t notice any slowdown or lack of responsiveness from the S21, though its back got a little warm.Like its predecessor, the Galaxy S21 comes with a 4,000 mAh battery. That’s fine for a phone of its size, though it's a pity Samsung didn't up the capacity a little. Still the adaptive refresh rate and improved chip efficiency should deliver better battery life. Set at the 60hz refresh rate, the Galaxy S21 managed 9 hours and 53 minutes in Tom's Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness over 5G.That’s not long enough to make our best phone battery life list, but it beats the 8 hours and 25 minutes of the iPhone 12. And it just about outlasts the Galaxy S20 with its 9 hours and 31 minutes, so the new silicon seems to be playing its part. Left in its default ""Adaptive"" mode, which dynamically adjusts the display's refresh rate, the Galaxy S21 lasted 6 hours and 31 minutes. That's not amazing, but it's far from bad when you get a vibrant display with a 120Hz refresh rate. Furthermore, the AI smarts in the S21 should learn about my phone use over time and better optimize battery consumption, but that’s not going to be something that happens over night. Charging is where things get a little messy. Fast charging is on offer over the USB-C PD standard, juicing up the battery to 55% in 30 minutes in our testing. The problem is, you need to make sure you have a charging brick to hand, as Samsung only puts the USB-C cable in the box. If you don’t have a charger then Samsung will sell you a 25W charger. Samsung made a big song and dance about this decision being environmentally friendly; of course, it saves Samsung money too. Ultimately, I feel this is the right move, whatever the motivation. Helping cut down on electronic waste is worth the extra expense and minor inconvenience it might cause some S21 buyers who aren’t flush with phone chargers.While I’ve used Samsung phones for years, I’m not the biggest fan of the user interface it drops on Android. But with the introduction of One UI in 2018, I’ve been slowly warming to Galaxy series take on Google’s mobile operating system. One UI 3 featured on the Galaxy S21 (and now older Samsung models that have upgraded to Android 11) builds upon this goodwill.The interface is more elegant, complete with a redesigned Quick Panel and a notifications screen that feels less cluttered. I especially appreciate the redesigned lock screen widgets as well as the ability to place widgets on the screen and adjust their transparency.One UI 3 still comes with a lot of options to tweak your Galaxy experience, which some will love. But it can get a bit overwhelming at times when you just want to find one particular setting. And my word, do I dislike the main apps drawer of the One UI. Despite its third iteration, the apps are arranged n a seemingly random manner which if you’re moving from one app-heavy phone to another can make finding the apps you want to set up your homescreen a minor nightmare. Compared to the elegance of the app drawer in stock Android, Samsung’s is a mess. I understand Samsung would like me to use its services, but so many other Android phones default to Google features, such as auto-fill for passwords. But One UI 3 tries to force me to use Samsung Pass and my Samsung account, which ironically I often forget the password for. It’s fine once you get setup, but it can be frustrating to use until you adapt to it. There’s still definitely room for Samsung to improve here. Nevertheless, One UI 3 is better that previous version. And it’s useful to remember that it comes with a lot of powerful tools such a Samsung DeX, which allows for the Galaxy S21, and other compatible Galaxy devices, to be connected to an external monitor to turn the phone into a pseudo Chrome OS experience.As the year goes on, the next big question is: what about the Galaxy S21 FE? The rumored successor to the S20 FE supposedly aims to offer what the Galaxy S21 offers for less. Considering the already low starting price of the S21, we're skeptical as to the need for an S21 FE, but Samsung is intent on making a convoluted, messy portfolio.The Galaxy S21 FE isn't confirmed yet and it could be a few more months before it launches. Its purported existence doesn't change our opinion on the Galaxy S21 as we've stated here. You can perpetually wait for the next big thing and we don't expect the Galaxy S21 FE to offer anything better than what you get with the S21.If you have an older phone such as the Galaxy S10, Google Pixel 4 or OnePlus 7T, then yes an upgrade to the Galaxy S21 is definitely worth it. If you have a more recent phone like the Galaxy S20 or Google Pixel 5, then you might be better off waiting. That's because we have several new phones that are available now, or are coming soon. Chief among the former is the iPhone 13. But if you're an Android fan, the Google Pixel 6 is right around the corner. Furthermore, it’s looking likely we’ll see the debut of the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE, which is poised to offer a more affordable but very capable take on the Galaxy S21. This late into the year, though, it might be best to wait until the Galaxy S22 early in 2022. With Black Friday coming on, however, you might be able to score a Galaxy S21 for cheap.Having said all that, if you’re desperate to upgrade then you can't really go wrong with the Galaxy S21 as it’s still an excellent phone that can be found for cheaper these days, especially if you shop around. With Samsung removing as much from this phone as it adds, I was prepared to be let down by the Galaxy S21. But I needn’t have worried. Sure, a plastic back isn’t ideal on a flagship phone but I soon got used to the polycarbonate, and the overall design of the Galaxy S21 is lovely, as well as more practical than the S20. The lack of any hardware upgrades for the cameras was a little disappointing, but then they still produce flagship-grade results and have a huge amount of features and tools to really dig into. I would have liked to have seen Samsung push the hardware envelope for the Galaxy S21, but that’s the domain of the Galaxy S21 Ultra. By making what I feel was the right choice when it came to removing features, the Galaxy S21 still offers the latest flagship chips, a fantastic display and powerful cameras in a refined smartphone at a competitive price; one that should worry the iPhone 12. The only fly in the ointment, is the Galaxy S20. If you already have an S20 then I don’t think you’ll benefit from an upgrade. I feel Samsung knows this and the S21 is more for people with older Galaxy phones or looking to move to their next phone. If you're in such a position, then I really suggest you consider the Galaxy S21 as you won’t be disappointed."
19,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3,"Price: $1,799 (256GB), $1,899 (512GB) CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB, 512GB External display: 6.2 inches (2268 x 832) 120Hz Adaptive Internal display 7.6 inches (2208 x 1768) 120Hz Adaptive Rear cameras: 12MP wide (f/1.8); 12MP ultrawide (f.2.2, 123-degree FOV); 12MP telephoto (f/2.4, 2x optical zoom, 10x digital zoom) Front camera: 10MP (f/2.2) Under-display camera: 4MP (f/1.8) Battery: 4,400 mAh Charging: 25W (charger not included) Size: 6.2 x 2.6 x 0.56 to 0.62 inches (closed); 6.2 x 5 x 0.25 inches (open) Weight: 9.55 ouncesThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is determined to win over foldable phone skeptics. Worried about the device’s durability? The display is up to 80% tougher, and the whole phone is water resistant. Want to do more with a massive 7.6-inch screen? There’s S Pen support, plus an under-display camera to make for a more immersive display. Think foldable phones cost too much? Well, we can’t help you much there. This sequel is still pricey at $1,799, but at least it’s $200 cheaper than its predecessor at launch. If you’re looking for a truly affordable foldable, the new $999 Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is a better bet. (For a deeper comparison, see our Galaxy Z Fold 3 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 3 face-off.)Other notable Galaxy Z Fold 3 upgrades include a brighter display and enhanced multitasking features, complete with a Windows-like taskbar. However, the battery life could be better, the design is still quite bulky, and Samsung should have included the S Pen.While this foldable remains a niche device, our Galaxy Z Fold 3 review shows that Samsung has refined the best foldable phone you can buy, making it an excellent choice for power users who want a phone and tablet in one gadget.The Galaxy Z Fold 3 was released on August 27. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a starting price of $1,799 for the 256GB model, and the 512GB version costs $1,899.Check out our best Galaxy Z Fold 3 deals page for all the biggest discounts, and you might also find our guide to the best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 cases helpful. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 adds a lot of in the way of durability, even if it's still on the bulky side.Right off the bat, you’ll be glad to know that the new Galaxy Z Fold is IPX8 water resistant, which means it can withstand being in up to 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. I doubt most people will dunk this foldable, but it’s good to know it can handle everything from splashes to rain.Unfortunately, we are not able to test water resistance on our review sample, but we have purchased a Galaxy Z Fold 3 and will put that unit to the test and update this review. Just note that the Z Fold 3 is not dust resistant, so I wouldn’t feel comfy bringing this foldable to the beach.To further fortify the Galaxy Z Fold 3, its stronger Armor Aluminum body and Gorilla Glass Victus display are designed to resist scratches and drops. Last but not least, Samsung claims that the Z Fold 3 employs a new protective PET film that when combined with “optimized” main screen layers results in a 80% more durable screen.The Galaxy Z Fold 3 measures 6.2 x 2.6 x 0.56 to 0.62 inches when closed and 6.2 x 5 x 0.25 when open. And it weighs 9.5 ounces. Compare that to 6.2 x 2.6 x 0.66 inches (closed), 6.2 x 5 x 0.27 inches (open) and 9.9 ounces for the Galaxy Z Fold 2. Still, this is way thicker and heavier when closed then most phones, so you'll feel it in your pocket. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 comes in three main colors: Phantom Black, Phantom Green and Phantom Silver. I’m a fan of the silver because it pops most. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 once again features two displays: a 6.2-inch OLED cover display and a 7.6-inch main screen that’s revealed once you unfold the device.Both panels offer a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, and I experienced smooth scrolling and overall performance during my hands-on time with the phone.The resolution for the interior screen is the same as before at 2208 x 1768 pixels, but the good news is that the new display is rated to be 29% brighter than before, thanks to new Eco display technology.The Galaxy Z Fold 3’s main display looks pretty stunning, and a big reason for that is a new under-display camera. Instead of having to stare at a notch or punch hole, the UDC on the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is nearly invisible, especially when you go full screen on content like photos and videos. When the display is dark, say on the home screen, you can make out the tiny hole, but it’s not that noticeable.Unfortunately, the Galaxy Z Fold 3’s display averaged 422 nits of brightness in our lab testing. That’s okay but nearly half what the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra turned in (821 nits), and the iPhone 12 Pro Max also hit a relatively high 654 nits.The Galaxy Z Fold 3's speakers are quite powerful and delivered clear and loud sound while listening to Spotify and when making calls. The sound can get a bit muffled when you stand the Z Fold 3 on a desk (one of the speakers is on the bottom) but overall the audio is solid from this foldable phone. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 Is a multitasking powerhouse. Thanks to the Multi-Active Window feature, you can run two apps side by side (dragging and dropping content between them) or run up to three apps at once. And now the enhanced App Pair feature lets you create shortcuts for two apps later in the same way you had them open. Don’t feel like constantly swiping in from the right side to open the Edge Panel to see these and other apps? Samsung added a new Taskbar feature that lets you switch between apps on the fly; it just sits there on the right side of the display, similar to the Windows taskbar. To get the Taskbar to work, I had to dig into the Settings menu and activate Samsung Labs, which most people won’t know how to do.Once activated, the Taskbar is a great addition. I love that I can quickly glance at how many notifications I might have in Slack, for example, then quickly switch to that app. Or I can quickly open my favorite App Pair: Gallery and Messages. Samsung Labs can also force apps that are not optimized for foldable displays to work in Multi-Active Windows mode. For example, I could park Netflix on the left side of the display and continue watching Outer Banks while keeping an eye on messages on the right side of the screen. Another cool feature is drag and split. For example, if you're in the Samsung browser and you're looking at items on Amazon, you can simply drag one over to the right to open a new window. That way you can look at the details on one product while comparing other products on the left. Other apps that support this feature including Samsung Message, MS Office, One Note and more. When you fold the Galaxy Z Fold 3 like a laptop, a number of apps support Flex mode, which puts the content up top and controls on the bottom portion on the display. This works in YouTube and the Camera app, and I also used it during a hands-free Google Meet video call. You can even force Flex mode to appear in apps, but I’d rather see more developers just embrace the feature.Samsung is also working closely with third-party developers to roll out more apps that work natively with the Galaxy Z Fold 3. These include Snapchat, TikTok, Netflix, Spotify and YouTube. For example, when you're using Spotify, you'll see the Now Playing window on the bottom left side and the rest of the discover menu on the right side, making it easier to multitask. But my favorite optimized app for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Chrome. I like being able to see all my tabs at the top and move them around, just as I would on the desktop. Given that I’ve always found using a stylus on even the biggest phablets cramped, it’s refreshing to see Samsung add S Pen support to a 7.6-inch foldable phone. There’s simply more room to take notes, sketch or mark up documents without needing to constantly zoom in.But right away, there's an issue with the Galaxy Z Fold 3's S Pen support. While the stylus will work with the foldable phone, it's not included, nor is there a built-in slot for the stylus like there is with Galaxy Note models. Instead, the S Pen is an accessory that you buy separately on top of the $1,799 you're already spending on your phone. If you want a way to store the pen, you'll need a specially designed case, which is another purchase.You've got two S Pen options — the $49 S Pen Fold Edition and the $99 S Pen Pro. The latter offers Bluetooth connectivity for supporting features like Air Gestures and other remote control capabilities. The S Pen Fold Edition is merely a writing instrument, albeit one that's been specially designed with a collapsible tip to work with the Galaxy Z Fold 3's screen.We tested the S Pen Fold Edition, and it's a good sturdy stylus in a uniform black. We struggled to find the S Pen’s button at times, and that's unfortunate since you'll need to press that button to activate features like off-screen memo or quick note. Just hovering the pen over the Galaxy Z Fold 3's active screen summons up the S Pen menu, though, giving you access to various tasks you can perform with the stylus.The Galaxy Z Fold 3's expansive 7.6-inch canvas offers ample space to jot down a quick note — just hold that button on the S Pen and tap the screen to start writing things down. If the screen is turned off, all you have to do is press and hold the S Pen button and tap the screen to create an off-screen memo.Other S Pen-powered features include productivity boosters such as Screen Write (a markup feature), Smart Select (pull text and pictures out of other apps) and translate (where you can tap words to find out what they mean in different languages). Other features like Live Message — where you can capture an image and add text and doodles — or AR Doodle for superimposing your drawings over real-world objects are less about productivity and more about fun.Note that you can only use the S Pen on the Galaxy Z Fold 3's main screen. The cover display doesn't support input from the stylus. This seems like an oversight, as if you want to jot down a quick note, maybe you don't want to bother with unfolding the device. There’s really not much new to report on the camera hardware front with the Galaxy Z Fold 3, with the exception of the under-display camera. But Samsung has brought some of the best camera features over from the Galaxy S21 Ultra, including Single Take (Dynamic Video) and Director's View (for using the front and back cameras at once). Other highlights include rear camera selfie and a Capture View Mode that lets you see your photos on the left and your live preview on the right.The rear cameras once again include a trio of 12MP lenses: an f/1.8 wide-angle shooter, an ultra-wide f/2.2 camera with a 123-degree field of view, and a 12MP telephoto camera. Based on our photo comparisons, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 takes colorful and mostly sharp photos. But it's a step behind the iPhone 12 Pro in terms of details and more realistic hues. And you miss out on the zooming power of the Galaxy S21 Ultra.You can see in this shot of portulaca flowers that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is capable of delivering vibrant colors, though the details could be a bit better in the petals when I zoomed in. I slightly prefer the contrast offered by the iPhone 12 Pro Max.In this portrait, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 does a mostly fine job with the bokeh effect, blurring out most of the background, though the leaves on the right side are fairly pronounced. My blue shirt really pops, and there's a good amount of detail in my hair, but my skin tone is a bit washed out, with the iPhone 12 Pro offering a warmer and more realistic take. Once again the Galaxy Z Fold 3 produces a colorful shot here of various peppers, offering saturated hues of green, orange, yellow and red. And this time the detail remained fairly strong as I zoomed in on the sign and even the stickers on some of the produce. It's nearly a draw with the iPhone 12 Pro Max, though once again the added contrast gives Apple's phone a slight edge, and the oranges are a bit richer.In this beach scene you can see that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 struggles to deliver the same amount of detail and subtlety as the iPhone, especially when it comes to the translucence of the water, the variations in sunlight and the bark in the tree on the right side.With Night mode engaged, I compared the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy S21 Ultra, and the Fold has an edge with more realistic colors. The S21 Ultra's shot is brighter but has an orange tinge to it. To test out the Galaxy Z Fold 3's selfie capabilities I used both the 4MP under-display camera and 10MP front camera, and it's no contest. My face looks blurrier and washed out with the UDC photo, and my hair, shirt and the surrounding grass just look better with the 10MP camera. For more on this UDC see my Galaxy Z Fold 3 under-display camera test results. It’s too bad that you get just a 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom with the Galaxy Z Fold 3. The Galaxy S21 Ultra, for example, packs dual telephoto lenses with 3x and 10x optical zoom, and that phone’s Space Zoom (digital) goes up to 100x.In the above photo the Z Fold 3 delivers a shot that's nearly as good as the S21 Ultra at 10x, even if the pic is a bit too bright. But the Galaxy Z Fold 3 pushes much further, as you can see in the above shot taken with the 50x zoom setting. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 proved mostly snappy in our hands-on time, and that’s because it has some pretty beefy hardware under the hood. A Snapdragon 888 chip runs the show, and it’s backed by 12GB of RAM. There’s also 256GB of internal storage standard, though you can opt for 512GB.In everyday use the Galaxy Z Fold 3 provided swift performance, whether I was running three apps at once or racing around the track in Asphalt 9. However, I did notice some glitches at times, such as when going from the cover display to the main display. On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 notched 3,418 on the multi-core portion of the test and 1,107 on single core. That’s on par with the the Galaxy S21 Ultra (3,400/1,123) but well behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max (4,100/1,600).The Galaxy Z Fold 3 wasn’t as far behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max on the 3DMark Wild Life graphics test. The Samsung mustered 33 frames per second, compared to 39 fps on the iPhone. On our video editing test using the Adobe Premiere Rush app, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 took 50 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. That’s faster than the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s 1 minute and 2 seconds but still slower than the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 28 seconds. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 packs a 4,400 mAh dual battery, which is a bit smaller than the Z Fold 2’s 4,500 mAh pack. And we were disappointed in the results of our web surfing battery test, which involves surfing the web over 5G on 150 nits of screen brightness. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 lasted just 7 hours and 52 seconds in 60Hz display mode, and even less on adaptive mode (up to 120Hz) at 6:35. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 lasted a much longer 10:10 and 9:05, respectively, on the same screen modes. Last year we used T-Mobile's network so that may account for some of the difference. We will report back with more test results.As expected, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 doesn't include a charger, so we used a 25W Samsung charger to test the charge time. After 30 minutes, the phone reached 47%, which isn't bad. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 also supports up to 10W wireless charging. You can also use the back of the Z Fold 3 to reverse wireless charge other devices up to 4.5W.Foldables are a category of their own and Samsung is essentially the only player right now. While Apple allegedly prepares its own foldable, we can only draw comparisons to what's available right now, and that's the iPhone 13 Pro Max.It's a bit unfair to compare these phones in some regards due to the differing form factors, but Samsung has to convince people to buy the Fold 3. And when compared to the new iPhone, the Fold 3 falls far short in several areas. Key among these are battery life and camera quality. In fact, the iPhone 13 Pro Max has earned a spot on our best phone battery life and best camera phones lists.Foldables are still in their infancy, but when you get an arguably better phone for several hundred dollars less, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a tough sell in some respects. It's still a neat and novel phone/tablet and it's by no means bad, but Apple knocked it out of the park this year. The Fold 3 has trouble keeping up in some places.With the Galaxy Z Fold 3, Samsung retains the title of best foldable phone, and that’s not just because there’s really no competition right now. You get a more durable design, improved multitasking and better displays for a little less money than last time around.The under-display camera is a step forward in terms of design, letting you see more of the screen when not in use. But you'll need to trade off some image quality from this 4MP shooter.Samsung also deserves credit for working with developers to optimize more apps for foldables. However, while I appreciate the S Pen support, Samsung should have included the stylus for $1,799. Plus, the battery life could be better and the overall design slimmer.Overall, the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a winner, but it's only for those users who are willing to pay a premium for a phone that can double as a tablet."
20,iPhone 13 mini,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-13-mini,"Price: Starting at $699 Display: 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR OLED (2340 x 1080) CPU: A15 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB Rear cameras: 12MP (f/1.6) main, 12MP (f/2.4) ultrawide Front camera: 12MP (f/2.2) Video: Up to 4K 60, 1080p 30 (Cinematic Mode) Battery life (hrs:min): 8:41 Charging: 20W wired, 15W MagSafe Size: 5.2 x 2.5 x 0.3 inches Weight: 4.97 ouncesSmall phones aren’t dead yet, with the iPhone 13 mini leading the charge. Don’t let this little guy’s size fool you — it packs a serious punch. With enhanced cameras and improved battery life over its predecessor, the new mini iPhone fulfills the dream for fans of diminutive handsets.While Apple reserved some of the best features for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max (like 120Hz displays, telephoto zoom and macro mode), the iPhone 13 mini gets plenty of welcome upgrades. You get a brighter display, fast A15 Bionic processor and compelling new camera features like Cinematic mode for video.In this iPhone 13 mini review, we’ll take a look at just how the best small phone in the world stacks up to its predecessor and the competition. And be sure to also check out our iPhone 13 Pro Max review, iPhone 13 Pro review, and iPhone 13 review.The iPhone 13 mini is available to buy right now. The 128GB model starts at $699, with the 256GB jumping to $799 and the top-end 512GB going for $999. Yes, Apple doubled the base storage this year while keeping the price the same. Considering all of the power under the hood, the iPhone 13 mini for $699 is a great deal.In the U.K. you're looking at a starting price of £679 for the iPhone 13 mini, with the 256GB model hitting £779, and the 512GB handset costing a healthy £979. Before you pull the trigger on buying one, I encourage you to check out our best iPhone 13 deals page to make sure you get the best offer. But, you may decide you want to wait another year for the iPhone 14 before making the upgrade from your current Apple phone; if so, check out the seven biggest upgrades we want to see from the iPhone 14.The iPhone 13 mini looks very similar to its predecessor with one notable change: the notch. It’s about 20% smaller this year, according to Apple, and it’s certainly noticeable. It’s nice to have more screen real estate, even if the notch is still there.The iPhone 13 mini features the same squared off edges and the small size is still easily pocketable and I could use it in one hand effortlessly. All the iPhone 13 models are IP68-certified, meaning that the 13 mini can survive up to six meters underwater for 30 minutes.I’m disappointed to see a lack of mask-friendly authentication on the iPhone 13 mini. Apple has failed to adapt Face ID to the mask life many of us still live. I’d like to see Face ID get smarter or for Apple to roll out Touch ID next time.The iPhone 13 mini’s 5.4-inch OLED display is relatively unchanged, but there’s a big boost in brightness this year. Thanks to the OLED panel, colors are punchy and vibrant with true, deep blacks. I played Genshin Impact (an interesting experience on such a small phone) and came away impressed with how well the phone rendered the saturated color palette. The iPhone 13 mini also portrayed the section in Blade Runner 2049’s third act well with rich contrast between the orange fog and the shadows.Here’s the breakdown of our display testing as compared to the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 mini. The iPhone 13 mini compares quite well against the iPhone 12 mini and Galaxy S21, with some slightly stronger saturation than Samsung’s phone. The Delta-E color accuracy score, where 0 is perfect, shows a slight edge over the S21.And with a max brightness of 788 nits in our testing, the iPhone 13 mini gets plenty bright enough to see outdoors. This is great especially for photography, meaning that you can actually see the photos you took even if you’re standing in direct sunlight.The iPhone 13 mini got several camera upgrades this year. The main 12MP camera has a larger sensor that lets in more light, improving photos in poorer lighting conditions. There’s also sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which Apple introduced on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. This should help things stay even more stable than traditional OIS.As for the 12MP ultrawide camera, it also has a larger sensor. There’s autofocus on board now, too, which can make a big difference in ensuring ultrawide shots come out sharp. For the following camera comparisons, I brought the Galaxy S21 along so you can see how Samsung’s best compares to Apple’s latest flagship.In this first outdoor shot, the phones had to capture the blue chairs, vibrant red door, the white wall, and the cloudy sky beyond. The iPhone 13 mini has a much richer image with brighter colors with a stronger sense of depth. The Galaxy S21 looks a bit washed out and flat in comparison. Otherwise, the two images are fairly similar, though I think the iPhone’s is truer to life.In this photo of flowers on a tree, a similar thing happened. The iPhone captured a more vibrant image without going too far with the saturation. The worn blue wall to the left and the orange umbrella in the background look realistic. The S21, as is usual with Samsung, has has some oversaturation issues, but it also struggled with the sunlight where the iPhone did not — there’s some lens flare in the S21’s picture.Heading inside, the iPhone 13 mini captured this scene well. It handled the natural and artificial light while maintaining the contrast and shadows. This image captures the mood and tone of the room and offers an artistic vibe. The Galaxy S21 also produced a good image that’s brighter than the iPhone’s. That said, it boosted the highlights too much and so lost much of the contrast. The final picture looks a bit flat and while it’s brighter, it’s not what that room looked like to my eye.In this second indoor image, both phones are nearly identical. The iPhone’s shot is a bit warmer and the S21’s is slightly brighter. Both phones captured the vibe of this scene with sharp focus on the tree decoration. However, the red of the books up top on the S21’s image look a tad washed out, while they’re a bright red in the iPhone’s photo.For portraits, both phones are once again rather similar. The iPhone 13 mini opted for a slightly warmer tone to complement the lighting that day, while the Galaxy S21 cooled things down and brightened the final image. Not only is the green in the iPhone’s picture richer, but the orange car behind me looks striking. The same car in the S21’s portrait looks a bit faded. However, both phones managed near perfect blur radii, even if the S21 applied too much face smoothing.For the ultrawide test, check out this cool vintage Beetle scrap heap. The focus on the iPhone’s photo is a bit sharper than the S21’s. That’s not to mention the color disparity, with the iPhone looking richer and the S21 having a washed out look. The yellow Beetle looks a bit livelier in the iPhone’s picture, whereas it looks a little too faded in the S21’s. This all comes back around to what I wrote in the outdoor section above.Night mode proved interesting, as you can see. The Galaxy S21’s attempt at photographing this smoker in the dead of night turned out much brighter than the iPhone 13 mini’s. Not only is the smoker in stronger focus with more details, but you can even see the fence slats in the background better. I expected much better from the iPhone, considering that Apple’s Night mode is usually very good.Wrapping up with front-facing camera comparisons, the two phones took two very different approaches. The iPhone 13 mini opted for a softer, warmer tone, highlighting the reds in my face and clothes behind me. The Galaxy S21 cooled things down and brightened them significantly, making my eyes brighter, but also applying too much face smoothing. New this year is what Apple calls Photographic Styles. You can think of these like real-time filters which come in four presets. You can select something that matches your personal taste and see what it looks like as you’re lining up your shot. You can also tweak things to totally match the style you want. It’s a cool feature that adjusts the camera settings on the fly instead of relying on a filter after the fact.You can see a sample gallery of the standard option and the different Photographic Styles above.Apple holds the crown for video recording on a smartphone, with the iPhone 13 series continuing that trend. The true star of the show this year is Cinematic mode. Possible thanks to the upgraded Neural Engine in the A15 Bionic, this new feature is portrait video on steroids.Not only does Cinematic mode apply a bokeh effect to your video, it can dynamically shift the focus depending on where your subject is in frame or where they’re looking. It’s quite interesting to see in practice, offering a truly artistic and professional way to record video. It tops out at 1080p 30 fps and all the work is done on-device.The true applications of Cinematic mode for the average person remain a mystery and I don’t think you should rush out to buy an iPhone 13 mini just to get this feature alone. It’s definitely neat and impressive, not to mention a great use of the Neural Engine, but, on its own, it doesn’t sell any of the iPhone 13 models for me. Regular video recording, meanwhile, remains a solid strength for Apple.With the new A15 Bionic system-on-chip, which includes a quad-core GPU, the iPhone 13 mini is a very powerful little phone. In fact, it destroys the best that Android has to offer, even the best gaming phones.The fastest chip that an Android phone can use, the Snapdragon 888, already had a hard time keeping up with the A14 Bionic from last year and the A15 furthers Apple’s lead over its competitors.We ran a few benchmarks, which you’ll find below.The iPhone 13 mini is quite a ways ahead of the Snapdragon 888-equipped Galaxy S21. It even beats out the iPhone 12 mini by a slight margin, which is what I’d expect for a next generation chip at this point.For example, look at the Adobe Premiere Rush benchmark, where a phone transcodes a 4K video file to 1080p as quickly as it can. The iPhone 13 mini managed it in a blistering 27 seconds, where it took the Galaxy S21 more than twice as long to accomplish the same task.The other benchmarks stress test the hardware, like the 3DMark Wild Life graphics test. You can see a noticeable jump from the iPhone 12 mini, and a huge leap over the Galaxy S21. Even in Geekbench, which measures CPU performance, the results show a significant difference between Apple and Samsung.While the Pro models perform better across the board with their bigger GPUs and 50% more RAM, the $699 mini does some serious work and provides the best bang for your buck.Check out our iPhone 13 benchmarks page to see how the iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 13 Pro compare to each other and the Android phone competition. Apple doesn’t disclose iPhone battery capacities, but the company did say that it improved the iPhone 13 mini’s battery life by up to one and a half hours over its predecessor. In our testing, that ended up accurate.In the Tom’s Guide battery life test, we set a phone’s display to 150 nits and task it to endlessly reload web pages over a 5G connection until it dies. Here’s how the iPhone 13 mini compares to the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 mini.Year-over-year, you can see an improvement of just over an hour. Still, over eight and a half hours of battery life is better than the iPhone 12 mini’s seven and a half. Head over to our iPhone 13 battery life results page to see how the iPhone 13 mini compares to the other new iPhones and the best Android phones. Apple once again didn’t include a charger, but that’s no surprise. Neither did the company upgrade the iPhone 13 mini’s charging speed, keeping the new phone at a 20W max wired. MagSafe is still here, which tops out at 15W. I would have liked to see the iPhone 13 mini get more competitive with its charging, especially as other phone makers push the limits of what’s possible. The iPhone 13 mini debuts with iOS 15, which is a pretty major update. It sports new features like tweaked notifications, Focus mode, FaceTime improvements and upgrades to many core apps such as Safari and Notes. We already have some excellent coverage on iOS 15, which I encourage you to check out so you can see exactly what’s new.Apple likes to keep the iOS experience as universal across devices as possible. Some of the older devices can’t do some of the new stuff due to hardware limitations, but iOS 15 on the iPhone 13 mini will feel basically the same as it does on the iPhone 12 mini. Other than some of the iPhone 13-specific features like Photographic Styles and Cinematic Mode, there’s not a whole lot to say about the software experience on the iPhone 13 mini. As is often the case with a new device, iPhone 13 owners have encountered a few problems. Among them, the iPhone 13 models are having a problem unlocking with the Apple Watch, though this issue doesn't appear to be affecting every user. Apple has officially acknowledged the problem and a fix is supposedly on the way. There are also issues with the touch display reportedly not being responsive enough in some cases, though that could be an iOS 15 issue. A couple of other problems are specific to the iPhone 13 Pro models, including that the cameras are automatically switching between lenses without warning and that  the ProMotion displays on the iPhone 13 Pros aren't running at 120Hz with some apps. Apple is said to be addressing both these issues in an update.See our iPhone 13 problems roundup for more info. The iPhone 13 mini continues the legacy laid down by the 12 mini last year. It’s the best small phone you can possibly buy, outpacing anything Android can offer. Fans of smaller handsets will love this phone, as it fits in many a pocket. I can think of a few people personally who would appreciate that.Even though the design hasn’t changed much, the iPhone 13 mini is still a pretty device. I appreciate the smaller notch, even if Apple doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen space. But what I dislike is the lack of competitive fast charging and biometric authentication that works with masks. The latter is a serious lost opportunity. Despite the iterative improvements made across the board with the iPhone 13 mini, none of them obviate the annoyance of typing in my PIN while in public, and doing so again for Apple Pay.If you’re on an iPhone 12 mini, I don’t think that the 13 mini is worth an upgrade. But if you’re coming from something older and want a small phone, this is basically the best you can get."
21,Google Pixel 4a,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-4a,"Price: $349 OS: Android 10 (updated to Android 11) Display: 5.81-inch OLED (2340x1080) CPU: Snapdragon 730G RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB Rear camera: 12.2MP (ƒ/1.7) Front camera: 8MP (ƒ/2.0) Battery: 3,140 mAh Battery life: 8:55 Size: 5.7 x 2.7 x 0.3 inches Weight: 5.04 ouncesThe Google Pixel 4a takes everything that made 2019's Pixel 3a great — the flagship-caliber camera, the thoughtful software, the impressive build quality — and improves upon it, while also lowering the price to $349. The result isn’t simply the best cheap phone on the market; it’s one of the best phones, period, even as we get closer to the first anniversary of its release.In fact, after testing the Pixel 4a when it shipped last year, I personally wouldn’t hesitate to choose it over the iPhone SE. While the iPhone SE is more powerful and has conveniences like wireless charging and water resistance, Google’s midrange offering tops Apple’s in several other areas, including a larger and brighter OLED display, more modern design and double the storage out of the box. There'a a reason the Pixel 4a topped the iPhone SE for best phone value in our Tom's Guide Awards 2021 honoring the top phones.I would prefer more battery life, and the Google Pixel 4a 5G is a better option if you want 5G connectivity and are willing to pay about $100 more. But as our Google Pixel 4a review illustrates, this is one of those rare affordable smartphones that does just about everything well. The only reason to look elsewhere for a phone is that Google now offers the Pixel 5a, which is more powerful, offers better cameras, and works with 5G, though it's also $100 more.Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for the phones category. The Pixel 4a won the best phone value award.The Pixel 4a continues to be available unlocked from Google and retailers like Amazon, though supplies are drying up. You can also buy the phone through Verizon's prepaid service, and US Cellular. At Google Fi, the Pixel 4a is no longer available now that the Pixel 5a is here.In the UK, you can still readily find the Pixel 4a, as Google didn't release the Pixel 5a in that market.There’s only one configuration of this $349 device with 128GB of storage. That's a $50 drop from the price of the Pixel 3a when that phone debuted in 2019. (We've got a look at all the differences between those two phones in our Google Pixel 4a vs. Pixel 3a face-off.)We reviewed the Just Black version. After this review went live, Google released a Barely Blue color option that's exclusive to its online store but seems to have sold out.As with all Pixel phones, there’s no microSD expandability here, so having all that space available from the get go is certainly useful.If you’ve seen Google’s Pixel phones in recent years, you know they don’t tend to take risks in terms of design. At a time when Mountain View’s competitors began churning out devices with miniscule bezels, massive multi-lens cameras and hole-punch front-facing shooters, the latest Pixels have been rather pedestrian in terms of their appearance, only distinguished by unique materials, finishes and colorways.And so it’s hardly surprising that the Google Pixel 4a looks a lot like Pixel 4, but cleaner and lighter, with slimmer bezels and a plastic-clad chassis replacing the pricier phone’s combination of glass and metal. Thankfully the Pixel 4a still manages to feel satisfyingly solid, thanks to a matte texture that’s pleasing to the touch. The square camera patch on the back seems a little silly, especially considering the Pixel 4a only features one lens and the LED flash, though at least the camera array is smaller and dare I say cuter than the one on the back of the flagship Pixel 4.Rather than an in-screen fingerprint sensor, the Pixel 4a has the rear-mounted capacitive Pixel Imprint scanner of old, which I actually prefer to newer optical and ultrasonic solutions. It’s cheaper to implement, so it keeps the cost of the phone down, and I also find it to be much snappier to use, with fewer false negative results. Additionally, because it’s on the back, you can effortlessly swipe down on it to reveal quick toggles and notifications, which makes for a handy shortcut.There are two things I really appreciate about the Pixel 4a’s design that deserve callouts. First is the headphone jack, the inclusion of which still isn’t lost on me all these years since most phone makers have abandoned it. The second is the presence of stereo speakers, which is especially impressive given that the Pixel 4a lacks the prominent top bezel of the Pixel 4.Despite the packaging constraints, Google was still able to stuff a speaker within the earpiece, housed in a barely-perceptible slit in the top edge. In conjunction with the bottom-firing speakers, it’s quite powerful — less warm and bassy as my iPhone 11 Pro’s drivers, but still just as loud.That said, this phone isn’t flashy, even though you can now pick either a black or blue version (at least if you do your shopping at Google). Blame the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, as Google has told us it originally released one color to “streamline manufacturing and prevent further delays.” It’s disappointing, especially because the Pixel line has always adopted a playful and refreshing approach to colors — though at least Just Black still receives a hint of flavor thanks to its mint power button.Unfortunately, there’s two areas in which the Pixel 4a falls to the iPhone SE where design is concerned. This phone isn’t rated for water resistance at all, and it cannot charge wirelessly. Given that those are rare features at this price, I’m not bothered too much by that — after all, the iPhone SE is the exception to the budget phone rule, not the norm. Also, for what it's worth, the infinitely more modern and attractive design of the Pixel 4a offsets those concessions. Given my penchant for small phones, I love that the 5.8-inch Pixel 4a is just a smidge taller than the 4.7-inch iPhone SE, but packs so much more screen real estate.The Pixel 3a was one of the cheapest handsets on the market with an OLED screen, and the Pixel 4a continues that distinction. The 5.81-inch, full-HD panel in Google’s new midrange phone delivers bold yet realistic color, and gets surprisingly bright as well.The deep, inky blacks of the Pixel 4a’s OLED panel lended a suitably dark and grizzly vibe to the trailer for the Train to Busan sequel, Peninsula, while the impressive contrast made the daybreak scenes all the more captivating. And as I watched the trailer for the new science fiction thriller Sputnik, I was drawn toward the flashing CRT monitors and lights illuminating the desolate darkness of a Soviet control room in crisis.When set to its Natural color profile, the Pixel 4a rendered 105.8% of the sRGB color space, which is actually a bit less saturated than the 111.2% of the LCD-powered iPhone SE. However, if you want more lively hues, you’re free to opt for the Boosted or Adaptive color settings on the Pixel. The iPhone SE has a slight advantage in terms of color accuracy though, notching a Delta-E score of 0.2 compared to the Pixel 4a’s 0.29. (Numbers closer to zero are better in this particular test.)When it comes to brightness, the Pixel 4a follows the precedent established by most Android phones, in that you can only access its true peak full-screen brightness setting when Adaptive Brightness is turned on. The maximum manual setting tops out at 433 nits; outdoors in sunlight, with the adaptive setting enabled, the Pixel 4a’s panel can reach 681 nits. By comparison, the iPhone SE can hit 653 nits no matter whether you use auto or manual brightness.Overall I’m hugely impressed with the Pixel 4a’s panel, save for two nitpicks. First, given that this phone is relatively low-priced compared to others that employ OLED technology, I’m not surprised that the viewing angles on the 4a pale slightly next to more premium OLED-toting models, like Google’s own flagship Pixel 4. There’s a bit of red and blue polarization that creeps in when viewing the panel from steep angles, though it’s nonexistent if you’re looking at the screen in a natural way, so it’s not a significant issue by any means.A more aggravating albeit fixable complaint concerns the Pixel 4a’s Adaptive Brightness tuning. Google introduced AI-aided Adaptive Brightness in Android 9 Pie, and unlike standard auto brightness, it’s built to learn your preferences and remember how bright you prefer your screen to be in certain lighting conditions. It worked excellently for me on the Pixel 3 and Pixel 4, but it’s an indecisive mess on the Pixel 4a.Upon turning Adaptive Brightness on, the device raised and lowered the brightness seven times in the space of a minute, even though I didn’t move the phone at all. I tried to lead it in the right direction by manually adjusting the slider every time it made a change I didn’t want, but that didn’t help either. The software is simply far too aggressive as it stands, and refuses to defer to the user’s wishes. Hopefully, it’s something Google will address in an update.Looking at the Pixel 4a spec sheet alone, you’d expect very little from its camera. It uses the same lens and sensor as the past two generations of Google phones, and the numbers — 12.2 megapixels and an ƒ/1.7 aperture out of a single lens — surely aren’t very awe inspiring in an era when flagship models are boasting triple-digit megapixel counts.But you can’t argue with results, and boy, does this combination of modest hardware and clever software deliver results. The Pixel 4a benefits from many of the same features you’ll find in Google’s more premium phones, including Super Res Zoom to improve the quality of digital zoom, Live HDR+ to see the effect of HDR processing before you tap the shutter and Dual Exposure sliders that give you the ability to modify contrast and brightness on the fly. Beyond that, there’s Google’s beloved Night Mode, and just like the Pixel 4, this model can capture the starry skies as well.No, the Pixel 4a doesn’t blow away the iPhone SE in every side-by-side image comparison that follows. But Google’s latest contender wins at enough of them, and offers so many more special features, that it’s hard to argue it’s not the best camera phone overall for the money.We start with this shot of a forest, and straight away it’s easy to tell that the Pixel 4a extracts more lush, verdant greens out of the vegetation and more deftly reins in the overexposed sky breaking through the leaves. The iPhone SE’s rendition of this scene feels washed out and oversharpened by comparison.However, the Pixel 4a’s emphasis on color can occasionally result in oversaturated scenes with unrealistically strong contrast, like this shot of a vase of sunflowers. The iPhone SE unquestionably delivered the more natural rendition here, as the yellow petals turn to a golden pseudo-orange through the Pixel 4a’s lens, and the shadows in the foreground and background alike are a little more pronounced than they should be.That said, I don’t think either shot is necessarily poor; personally speaking, if I took the iPhone’s shot and did some light editing to it before sharing, I’d probably end up with the Pixel’s version, so it’s really a matter of preference.Here I used 3x zoom on both devices to illustrate the advantage that Google’s Super Res Zoom tech offers. To me, this is the most underrated feature in any Pixel camera. Super Res Zoom almost negates the need for optical zoom or a telephoto lens by using natural hand shake and motion to intelligently “fill in” areas of the frame, giving the sensor more information to work with and thereby improving sharpness and overall image quality. Where the iPhone SE’s take is overcome with noise, the Pixel’s is precise, with more neutral white balance as well.As both the Pixel 4a and iPhone SE sport single-lens rear cameras, they rely entirely on software to separate foreground and background for shallow depth-of-field bokeh shots. You immediately notice the vast difference in perspective the Pixel 4a and iPhone SE offer when capturing portraits — Google’s handset crops into the frame to simulate the use of a telephoto, while Apple’s doesn’t fuss with the vantage point.Personally, I prefer Google’s approach, as it’s simply more useful for portrait taking. If I wanted to achieve a portrait more like the Pixel’s with the iPhone, I would have had to move in mere inches from the subject’s face — awkward already, but certainly a no-no in the age of social distancing.Comparing the two on the basis of quality alone, however, Apple’s camera wins in terms of sharpness, and also accurately separates the subject from his surroundings — something that the Pixel 4a struggles with, particularly with the bokeh erroneously applied to the individual’s ear. That said, Google’s device was less intent on overly smooth facing features, and the colors, speaking both of the environment and the subject’s skin tone, are slightly more accurate.A big question surrounding the Pixel 4a’s camera will likely be how it performs at night. Given that it has a Night Mode, which the iPhone SE lacks, it’s hardly surprising that it emerges the victor in this particular face-off. Google’s software is able to illuminate far more of the image, providing a sharp and noise-free view of the front door of the house in the image, while rendering the shadow of the railing on the grass below with exceptional contrast. It’s an example of how powerful a good Night Mode can be, as well as a reminder of the iPhone SE’s most glaring deficit.Turning the camera back at myself, there are again aspects I like about both of these attempts. The Pixel 4a, with its 8MP front camera, is better at managing highlights and shadows, managing not to overexpose my white t-shirt like the iPhone did, while dulling the shine of my face on a humid, hot summer day. That said, Google’s take is inexplicably blurrier, and strangely warps the proportions of my face just a bit, despite beautification or retouching features being turned off.Of course, starting with the Pixel 4a 5G, Google added a second ultrawide angle lens to its A Series phones. That trend has continued with the Pixel 5a, which also matches up well against other camera phones under $500.One of the most obvious concerns surrounding the Pixel 4a — or any budget-minded Android phone — tends to be performance. Qualcomm’s flagship 8 Series Snapdragon chipsets are tried and tested in flagships from every manufacturer, and 9 times out of 10, they perform flawlessly. But the chipmaker’s lower-end silicon often falls somewhere between weak and serviceable, and let’s face it — no mid-tier Qualcomm CPU is going to embarrass Apple’s A13 Bionic tech in the iPhone SE, let alone the even more powerful A14 Bionic powering the iPhone 12 models.Bearing all that in mind, I’d say the Snapdragon 730G chipset in the Pixel 4a, coupled with its 6GB of RAM, delivers smooth and sufficient performance overall, though obviously faster phones have come out since the Pixel 4a's debut.I often swap between an iPhone 11 Pro and Pixel 4 for my daily drivers, but during my time reviewing the Pixel 4a, I never felt desperate for power. In fact, when it comes to the basic tasks, I reckon the Pixel 4a is every bit as sprightly as the Pixel 4.Unsurprisingly, though, gaming and photography where things start to waver a bit. Playing Asphalt 9 Legends on the Pixel 4a was a fine experience overall, but occasional skipped frames and a lower rendering resolution kept me well aware of the hardware I was racing on.Likewise, you’ll have to wait a second or few longer for the Pixel 4a to conjure its post-processing magic on photos with that 730G chip, as this cheaper Pixel lacks Google’s dedicated Visual Core architecture. Burst shots, or repeatedly tapping the shutter for a bunch of frames in quick succession, won’t quite yield immediate results.The benchmarks tell us why. In Geekbench 5, which evaluates overall system performance, the Pixel 4a achieved a multi-core score of 1,647 points; the iPhone SE managed 3,226, and with just one of the A13 Bionic’s six cores, it hit 1,331 alone. The Pixel 4a also took far longer to dispatch our Adobe Premiere Rush video encoding test, clocking 2 minutes and 27 seconds to convert a minute-long 4K video clip to 1080p. The iPhone SE needed just 47 seconds for the same task.Ultimately, I believe the Pixel 4a’s performance will certainly be adequate for the vast majority of people, even with more powerful midrange phones now available. But if all-out power for the absolute least money is your priority, the iPhone SE remains unassailable. And if you're more of an Android fan, the Pixel 5a offers a performance boost with its Snapdragon 765G system on chip.Armed with a 3,140-mAh battery — a modest size by today’s standards, even though Google notes it’s the largest battery ever fitted to a “small” Pixel — the Pixel 4a’s battery life isn’t anything special. Google’s new midrange phone lasted an average of 8 hours and 55 minutes across four sessions of Tom’s Guide’s battery test, where the device endlessly refreshes web pages while set to 150 nits of screen brightness.That’s a bit worse than the 9 hours and 18 minutes the iPhone SE turned in, and considerably poorer than a number of pricier smartphones, including the OnePlus 8 (11:04) and iPhone 11 (11:16), though ironically, the Pixel 4 actually churned out an hour less than its half-price brethren. If you want better battery life for even less than the Pixel 4a, we’d direct you toward the $249 Moto G Power, our current leader for the best phone battery life at an astonishing 16 hours and 10 minutes.If you decide to go for the Pixel 5a, instead, you can expect better battery life. That phone lasted 9 hours and 45 minutes on our battery test.At least the Pixel 4a recharges rather quickly, owing to its packed-in 18-watt adapter. This brick got our unit from completely dead to exactly half capacity in 30 minutes, which is pretty speedy for a device in this class. While it’s nice to know the Pixel 4a can juice back up in a pinch, its longevity on a charge is easily its weakest quality.Just as Google preserved the Pixel 4’s best camera tricks despite the Pixel 4a’s lower price, the Pixel 4a contained many of our favorite Pixel features that made Android 10 a little bit better at the time of the phone's launch. The Pixel 4a has subsequently gotten the Android 11 update, so you can expect the latest and greatest Android experience. The newly released Android 12 beta runs on the Pixel 4a, too, and the full version will run on this phone when it debuts in a few weeks.Android-based conveniences abound in the Pixel 4a, including Call Screen, which can fend off robocalls and telemarketers without forcing you to pick up your phone just to be duped. Google’s excellent Recorder app is here too — software we once hailed as our favorite app, because it transcribes voice to text in real time, and it’s also really, really good at it. Recorder can now export transcriptions to Google Docs, for even more seamless note taking.Otherwise, this is Android as you know and love it, with the addition of Android 11 features like Bubbles and notification grouping for messaging apps; one-time permission granting for apps; built-in screen recording; and a new power menu that offers quick access to your Google Pay cards and passes.One feature that was often derided in Google previous Pixels that I actually miss in the Pixel 4a is Active Edge — the pressure-sensitive sides of the device that you can squeeze to summon Google Assistant. It was a feature that was admittedly easy to forget about, but proved quite handy when committed to memory. Google omitted Active Edge in the Pixel 4a presumably in the name of keeping costs low, and we wonder if it’ll ever return in another Pixel again.Google promises a minimum of three years of software and security updates for the Pixel 4a, which is far better than the usual year that most cheap Android phones get, or even the two years at best granted to higher-end models. Of course, three years falls short of the five or so years Apple supports its handsets, but it’s respectable nevertheless.The iPhone SE is an excellent proposition for those who want to remain in the Apple ecosystem, and of course its performance is unmatched, thanks to the A13 Bionic chip. The iPhone SE also offers a water-resistant design and wireless charging — two features the Pixel 4a lacks.That said, the Pixel 4a is superior in many ways. It has a more sophisticated camera, a newer design with slimmer bezels, a much roomier OLED display, fast charging out of the box and a headphone jack — all for $50 less than the 64GB iPhone SE and a full $100 less than the model with comparable storage. I personally think the Pixel 4a is a better phone for most people, because it checks more boxes.The OnePlus Nord is an excellent alternative to the Pixel 4a, provided you live in an area where OnePlus’ midrange phone is available. The £379 Nord offers a larger 6.4-inch display with a faster 90Hz refresh rate, 5G connectivity and a bigger battery that lasts longer on a charge. The Nord also pulls off both wireless charging and wired charging that’s even faster than the Pixel 4a’s.Since this review as posted, OnePlus has shipped the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, available for a mere $299. That phone offers 5G — the Pixel 4a does not, making that omission seem more glaring as time goes by. With the Pixel 4a, Google has once again delivered a device I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to anyone who wants the best phone for the least amount of money — at least if they don't want to hold off for the expected release of the Pixel 5a in a couple months.The Pixel 4a does practically everything well — it has a pretty display, solid performance, lots of base storage, a well-built design and especially, a stunning camera. About the only area in which it comes up short is battery life, but even then, that’s not a deal breaker.The midrange phone market is flush with options, and many will naturally shop the Pixel 4a against its two best competitors — the iPhone SE (which is faster) and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G (which has a better display, bigger battery and 5G). And of course, there's a better in-house option a year after the Pixel 4a's release in the form of the Pixel 5a, though you will have to pay more for that model.But overall, the Pixel 4a strikes a great balance between affordability, performance and quality. Like its predecessor, it makes you wonder why anyone should spend twice or three times as much on a so-called flagship. If you're on a tight budget and dead set against paying more than $400 for a phone, the regular Pixel 4a remains a great value that's becoming harder to find. Otherwise, we recommend opting for the more powerful Pixel 5a at this point."
22,iOS 15,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ios-15,"The best compliment I can pay iOS 15 is that for all the changes Apple’s latest software update introduces — and there are a lot of them — it isn’t long after updating that the enhancements blend into your everyday iPhone usage. The changes and enhancements seem a natural extension of what’s already there.I’ve been using iOS 15 since the first beta came out earlier this summer. My standard practice is to install any iOS beta on a couple different iPhones (an iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone 12 in this instance), occasionally referring back to a reference device like my wife’s iPhone just to confirm what’s different from the last iOS update. In recent weeks, I find myself borrowing my wife’s iOS 14-powered phone more frequently, as the many iOS 15 enhancements feel like they’ve always been there on my phone. That’s a sign of a successful upgrade.iOS 15 isn’t a revolutionary upgrade — while the changes are many, there’s no radical rethinking of what you can and can’t do on an iPhone. But at this stage in the life of Apple’s smartphone business, it doesn’t need to be. iOS 15 beefs up some built-in apps that needed retooling highlighted by changes to FaceTime and Maps, introduces some new welcome new capabilities like being able to store ID cards in Wallet and super-charges your iPhone’s on-device intelligence with new features like Visual Look Up and Live Text. Not all of these changes are fully polished, but when you download iOS 15, you should like what you see. iOS 15 has been available as a public beta since the end of June, but the software is now out as a download that anyone can install. Just head to the Settings app on your phone and tap General — from there, you can select Software Update, where iOS 15 will be there waiting for you, if you haven’t installed the update yet.As for supported devices, if your phone runs iOS 14, you'll be able to upgrade to iOS 15. That means anything from an iPhone 6s onward will work, including the original iPhone SE and the 7th gen iPod touch. iPads get their own version of the software, known as iPadOS 15. Be aware that not every iOS 15 feature will work on older iPhones, with capabilities that require a lot of neural processing power only available on iPhones with at least an A12 Bionic processor. These include:iOS’s 15 revamp of the FadeTime video messaging app would go down as one of the most prominent changes in iOS 15, though the biggest addition isn’t available with iOS 15’s debut. That would be SharePlay, the much ballyhooed feature that lets you watch videos, listen to music and share your screen with everyone else on a FaceTime call. SharePlay won’t appear until a later update as Apple fine-tunes the capability that will be available across iPhones, iPads and Macs. It doesn't sound like we'll be waiting long for SharePlay — the feature has already resurfaced in the iOS 15.1 beta currently in the hands of developers and beta testers as of this writing.Don’t let SharePlay’s current omission trick you into thinking there’s nothing new under the FaceTime sun. iOS 15 introduces a number of changes aimed at making FaceTime a compelling alternative to Zoom, Microsoft Teams and all the other video messaging tools we’ve been using for the past 18 monthsI’m not going to pretend that FaceTime has been high on my list of go-to video messaging apps, and that’s largely because I’ve found the app to be too cluttered for my taste, particularly for group calls. iOS 15 fixes that by giving you a grid view option that neatly stacks the faces of the people on a call instead of treating them as floating windows that resize depending on who’s talking.Even better, FaceTime in iOS 15 lets you reap the benefit of spatial audio, at least if you’ve got an iPhone XR or later. With spatial audio, you’ll hear the voice of the person speaking emanating from the part of the screen where their square is located. It's a seemingly small tweak, but it makes a world of difference in letting video calls feel more natural.Those aren’t the only audio enhancements in FaceTime. The app also adopts new Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum features — the former can filter out background noise on calls so that your voice is amplified while the latter can pick up all the ambient sounds around you. Even better, those features can be adopted by third-party apps, as can FaceTime’s newfound ability to introduce a background blur when you’re on camera.One last addition to FaceTime will benefit people who don’t have an iPhone. Apple is extending FaceTime to Android and Windows, too, though with a browser-based interface and not a dedicated app. You can now schedule FaceTime calls by creating shareable links. And just in case you’re concerned that someone uninvited might crash your call, you not only have gatekeeper powers over who can enter a call, but you can also boot people out 30 seconds after they join if they turn out to be an imposter.So what about SharePlay, a change so sweeping that it will also come to iPad, Mac and Apple TV software?  When SharePlay arrives, most likely as part of the iOS 15.1 update, you'll able to stream audio or video on a FaceTime call, and it will play for the other people you're FaceTiming with, with playback synced up so that everyone's watching or listening at the same time. You can also share your iPhone screen via SharePlay.Other video chat apps offer similar features, whether they're built in or available as extensions, but Apple including the functionality within its own video messaging app is significant. And Apple clearly has high hopes for SharePlay, as it's releasing a developer tool so that software makers can add compatibility to their apps to work with FaceTime once the feature comes via a future iOS 15 update. To that end, Apple promises that prominent streaming services like Disney Plus, Hulu, Paramount and others.Before Apple removed SharePlay from iOS 15 betas — and before it returned in iOS 15.1 — I tested the feature using Apple TV Plus, watching an episode of Ted Lasso with two of my Tom's Guide colleagues. Each one of us could control playback from our various devices. I could even resize the video window to make it easier to view Ted Lasso's antics while minimizing the FaceTime window, and then flip around the sizes when I wanted to see my colleagues' reaction. When FaceTime arrives, you can also switch to text or audio chats, so the video playback is front and center.In beta form, SharePlay did a pretty good job of dropping the audio of whatever it is you're watching or listening to so that you can keep your conversation going. However, audio controls in SharePlay seemed to be universal — you can't boost the volume of what you're playing back without also increasing the volume on your FaceTime call, at least in my initial testing. Perhaps that’s something Apple is fine-tuning right now.If FaceTime tackles Apple's stated goal of keeping people connected with iOS 15, then the new Focus feature is front and center for the company's plan to free us from distractions and time sucks. Think of Focus as a more refined version of Do Not Disturb, keeping out irrelevant notifications and even restricting your home screen to only the apps you need to access for the task at hand.For example, you can set a Work focus that blocks out notifications from streaming apps and social networking tools; it can also restrict incoming messages from contacts you haven't white-listed. To filter out distractions even further, you can designate a home screen that only displays your work-focused apps. (I've got mine set up to show off Slack, Gmail, Google Docs and a couple handy utilities, plus widgets for my reminders and calendar appointments.) Other iOS 15 users will see your Focus status in Messages and, hopefully be less inclined to ping you (or at least know why you're not as responsive as usual.) Third-party messaging apps have the option of displaying your Focus status as well — a feature I hope many of them pick up. What’s more,  your Focus setting follows you from device to device, since iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey support the feature, too.Focus is easy enough to set up and turn on, which is half the battle. Focus lives in the Control Center, so you just swipe down from the upper corner of your iPhone screen (on the iPhone X or later) to set your focus. You can also turn off a focus by tapping on the icon that appears on your phone's lock screen when you've got the feature enabled. We've largely talked about setting up a work focus, but Apple lets you customize and name whatever focus mode you want, whether it's for gaming, family time, driving, sleeping or what have you.My one criticism of Focus is that the home screen feature is a little bit limited. You don’t create a new home screen that only appears when you turn on a particular focus mode and fades into the background when you're done. Instead, you select an existing home screen. This is actually contrary to how I organize my apps, where I put the most frequently used on one screen, whether they're for work or personal use. Also, you can still access apps you've left out of your focus by swiping left until you reach the App Library, so it's not as if I can't launch PUBG Mobile when I really should be answering that email from the boss.I mentioned that Focus setup is half the battle, but the other part of what determines whether the new feature will be a success is out of Apple’s control. For Focus to truly work, you’ve got to adapt your working habits, remembering to turn Focus modes on and off. This hasn’t really happened for me yet, though perhaps with IOS 15 out of beta, I’ll be more diligent about using the distraction-fighting tools Apple’s provided. Still, as promising as Focus is, don’t treat it like a silver bullet for immediately addressing your need to go distraction-free.Apple's attempts to do away with distractions don't stop with Focus. The company is taking another stab at streamlining notifications in iOS 15. App icons on notifications are now larger, making them easier to spot at a glance so that you can determine if this notification is really worth your time; incoming messages will show the contact photo you've assigned to a person in the Contacts app.You also have the option to temporarily mute notifications, either for an hour or a day. Just swipe left on the notifications to bring options, which now include your expanded choices for muting. iOS 15 is also smart enough to suggest you mute a conversation if you haven’t replied in a while.The biggest change to notifications, though, is Apple's new notifications summary, which you set up in the Notifications section of the Settings app. When setting up a summary, you can decide which app notifications you only need to see at select times of the day — those will then appear in on-screen summary at a time of your choosing, so you can skim through updates you may have missed without feeling bombarded throughout the day. I've found the summary to be a clever way to discover when new podcast episodes are available without having that info interrupt me during my work day.Count me as one of the people who's gotten over Apple's stumble in moving away from Google Maps to its own mapping data nearly a decade ago in iOS 6. Maps has steadily improved, particularly in recent years, and I prefer it to Google Maps. It probably helps that I live near Apple HQ and therefore often get access to Maps improvements long before they roll out to other parts of the country.Case in point with Maps in iOS 15: this new update adds more detailed 3D views of cities that include better landmarks, 3D buildings, clearly labeled commercial districts, more detailed roads and trees, with all that data collected from the vehicles Apple sends around to improve its master map. That feature is available in select cities, initially — San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and London — before it hits other places. Having gazed at downtown San Francisco, with a detailed Oracle Park nestled against the San Francisco Bay, I can tell you it's a look that really helps you get a sense of place when you explore in Maps.At least everyone with an iPhone XR or later will be able to experience the new interactive globe that's now visible in iOS 15. Zoom out and you'll see a view of the earth from space, complete with an accurate star field. Zoom in and you'll see other details — mountain ranges, deserts, ocean depths — that are clearly labeled, making it feel like you've got an interactive relief map stored on your phone.A more practical addition to Maps is the app's new 3D driving view that gives you a driver's eye perspective on roads around complex interchanges. I took Maps for a spin around the MacArthur Maze, a series of interchanges, merge lanes and potential wrong turns in the East Bay, and Maps clearly showed me which lane I had to worry about and which ones were merely flyovers. (One complaint: In the beta at least, Maps was labeling the streets that are below overpasses but that have no exits — an unnecessary level of detail that I found mildly distracting. I’ll check to see if iOS 15’s full release has tweaked that feature on my next road trip.) Also helpful were 3D renderings of roadside buildings that helped orient me as to where I was on the road.People who rely on public transit in major cities will appreciate that Maps now includes key bus routes. (That feature works in downtown San Francisco for me, for example, but not in my home city 14 miles away.) You can also pin your favorite transit lines to easily spy departure times. The least fleshed out feature in iOS 15 is immersive walking directions, limited to the Bay Area when I was testing the feature. In theory, it’s a clever addition — Maps will superimpose arrows and street names when you’re walking to confirm you’re going in the right direction. In practice, though, the feature is awkward to use. You first need to scan the surrounding area with your phone — drawing attention to yourself when you might already feel disoriented. The superimposed directions will then appear, but if you turn to head in that direction, they’ll only resurface when you turn tour phone to face across the street, 90 degrees from the direction you’re walking. At the same time, your iPhone will warn you of the dangers of looking at your phone screen while walking. All told, it’s a bit of a mess, unlike the other more polished additions to Maps. We can argue about what the biggest changes are in iOS 15, but there's no question as to the most controversial addition. Safari in iOS 15 sports a new look inspired by Apple's efforts to streamline the version of the browser in macOS Monterey. And I don't think I'm going out on a limb when I say that this new approach is not going to be universally loved, especially when Apple has already introduced an option for rolling back some of Safari’s new look.By default, Safari's tab bar lives at the bottom of the screen. Apple is betting that we'll all get used to it, especially since placing the tab bar down by your thumb makes the browser easier to navigate with one hand. I certainly had no problem doing so with an iPhone 12; using the browser one handed on the iPhone 11 Pro Max was more challenging but still doable.At least the tab bar is unobtrusive, disappearing into the bottom of the screen as you scroll through a page. Tapping the bottom causes it to pop back up again. And if you really hate the new look, Apple made a change to the iOS 15 beta that lets you return the tab bar to the top of the Safari screen if you prefer.Initially, I was not a fan of Safari’s renovations, mostly because I found navigating to different tabs very complicated on smaller-screen phones. But Apple made some tweaks to Safari’s look during the beta process that improved navigation. And frankly, I got used to the tab bar being where it was. I wish I could say the same for the X icons used to close out Safari tabs, which are on the right side of the tab thumbnail, not on the left where my brain thinks they should be.Speaking of those tabs, Safari also adopts a new grid view to show you an overview of any open tabs. This is a more handy view than the stacked windows featured in previous versions of iOS, as you can see all your tabs at a glance.Apple introduced this tab overview grid to better support another addition to Safari in MacOS Monterey — grouped tabs. Whether on your Mac or your iPhone, you can now group related browser tabs together. I find it useful when looking for online recipes to store them in one collective tab, for example. Jumping between pages is as simple as swiping right or left on your iPhone screen. In addition to those changes, iOS 15's Safari adds support for web extensions, a feature I haven't had a chance to dig into yet, though I expect that will change as developers launch mobile-friendly extensions..For a while now, Google Lens has offered AI-driven super-powers that allow you to use your camera for everything from finding out more about the world around you to capturing and acting upon the text in images. iOS 15 follows suit by adding Live Text and Visual Look Up to your iPhone's bag of tricks. It's very much in line with Apple's history of not necessarily being the first to add a feature, but attempting to do it better than its rivals. And as I found out when testing Live Text and Visual Look Up vs. Google Lens, Apple’s made some strong early strides.Live Text does what it says in its name. If there's text in a photo you've taken, you can tap on it to capture it and copy it. You can then pin the resulting text in a note, email or text. The feature works best with clearly printed text as opposed to handwritten notes, but it's a step in the right direction. Live Text support in iOS 15’s Notes app even lets you summon the phone’s camera from within the note taking app and capture text directly.An even better component of Live Text is the ability to call phone numbers or look up addresses directly from the photos you've shot containing phone numbers and addresses. Just long press on a phone number, for example, and a pop-up menu appears giving you the option of starting a phone call, sending a text message, adding a number to your contacts or even placing a FaceTime call. Results with addresses have been more hit and miss — sometimes, Live Text picks up the street number but not the city, so you can get directions to entirely the wrong location.Visual Look Up is similarly hit or miss — some things Siri recognizes, other things it doesn't. For instance, when I swiped up on photos that I took in the Musée de l'Orangerie, Visual Look Up correctly identified paintings by Monet and Rousseau, though other shots produced no such knowledge. The feature couldn't — or wouldn't — recognize baseball stadiums from a trip to Texas I took in 2019, but it did have plenty of info on the iconic Sather tower on the University of California, Berkeley campus.My takeaway is that Live Text is pretty dependable on just about everything but transcribing handwriting and some plaques. Visual Look Up is a little more inconsistent, but when it has additional information to impart about your photos, it’s very helpful.Past iOS updates have introduced a lot of changes to Messages, as Apple's chat app has evolved into a place where a lot of iPhone users spend most of their time. The Messages additions are pretty minimal in iOS 15, unless you're hankering for new Memoji clothing and accessibility options. But there is one fairly significant addition — Shared With You — that also impacts a number of other built-in apps.Now, when someone shares with you a web link, photo, song, or podcast, it will not only appear in Messages, but also in a Shared with You section in the relevant iOS app. (Apps supporting Shared with You include Safari, Music, Podcasts, News, Photos and TV.) The idea is that you don't always have the time to look at what someone's sharing with you right at that instant, but when you do have a free moment to look, you can find it more easily in the relevant app.For example, when my wife finds a web article she thinks I’d find interesting, the subsequent link now lands in a Shared with You section in Safari that lives on Safari's start page underneath frequently visited pages and above the browser's privacy report. Similarly, photos that my friends text me now get a Shared with You section on the For You tab in the Photos app. I can also pin these items in Messages to find them easier.Even better, I have the option of replying to all that shared content from within the relevant app instead of having to schlep back to Messages. A reply box lets me respond to those web links my wife is sending me or to the photos I've gotten. Replying to shared content from group texts can be a little trickier — you tab the name of the person who shared it with you to bring up a reply window — but it’s doable.While we're on the subject of photos in messages, it's a lot easier to save them now in iOS 15. To save a photo from Messages in iOS 14, you had to long-press on the photo, then select Save from the ensuing pop-up menu. iOS 15 simply adds a save icon right next to the photo in your Messages conversation; tap it, and the image is saved to your Photos library.Photos doesn’t get the most sweeping changes in iOS 15, but the enhancements made to the Memories feature in particular make it one of my favorite things about iOS 15. In the new update, Photos will still auto-assemble collections of images into a slideshow based around a date, location, trip or event, but now you can add songs from Apple Music. The real treat, though, is being able to personalize your memories.You can tap on the Memories as they play and hit an icon that looks a lot like a music note to adjust both the song that plays and the filter that appears on your images. I wish the controls lingered on the screen a little longer — they have a habit of disappearing while you're still trying to figure out what button takes you where — but this is an addition that will really let you flex your creative muscles and put your own stamp on various photo collections. You can control playback, too, and iOS 15 introduces new Memory types. It really makes the Photos app more engaging.That's clearly the highlight of Photos, which also adds more detail to the info panel that appears when you swipe up on an image to see when and where it was taken. New info includes the lens used as well as the shutter speed, if you're the type that likes to drill into these sorts of things. You can also tell Photos to not show certain people or memories as frequently by tapping a Feature Less option. People recognition features are better, too, with a shortcut for adding names of the people who appear in your shots.Like Photos, Notes doesn’t see a lot of changes in iOS 15, but you’ll really like the productivity-boosting enhancements that are there. A new tagging feature — you just type a hashtag and the name of your choosing, such as “#research” for study notes — helps you organize notes by grouping similarly tagged items together. (Apple correctly sees tags as a great approach to organization all around, as the iOS 15 version of Reminders adds that feature too.)An even better addition to Notes bolsters the shared notes feature that Apple’s built-in note taker has had for a while. Now you can assign tasks to people just by adding their name next to an @ symbol. I’ve found it a helpful way of calling a collaborator’s attention to a specific part of a shared note.By this point, we’re all pretty comfortable with using the Wallet app to stash credit cards, organize electronic passes and manage Apple Pay usage. But Apple wants to turn this feature into a true digital wallet, capable of holding electronic ID cards and even digital keys.On the ID card front, eight states — Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah — have already committed to bringing digital driver’s licenses and state ID cards to iOS 15 wallet. We’re also waiting on word for more car makers, hotel chains and lock makers to detail on what cars, hotels and offices will offer digital keys through wallet.That’s already a pretty lengthy list of new features, and we’ve only scratched the surface of what’s coming in iOS 15. Here’s a quick rundown of other changes of note.Chances are you’re going to upgrade to iOS 15 no matter what I tell you. Apple has the stats showing how many people migrate to its OS updates, and it’s a percentage that puts Android to shame. So let’s assume you’re going to upgrade to iOS 15. The big question, as always, is when.Recent major iOS updates have had their share of bugs, which can be impossible to predict. In my own experience, the iOS 15 beta was pretty stable. I’ve been using it on my everyday phone since mid-summer without any hiccups. The most persistent bug I noticed involved apps crashing when I launched them, requiring a relaunch. Annoying, sure, but hardly a show-stopper.That’s not to say bigger bugs might be lurking. Since this review was published, reports have surfaced about iOS 15 affecting AirPods audio and pairing. (It's not something I've experienced with my AirPods and my iPhone 11 Pro Max, but my colleague Rory Mellon has, and it sounds very annoying.  Spotify has also confirmed that its iOS app drains the battery of phones running iOS 15.The truly cautious may feel better by waiting to see if early adopters experience any other problems or if these issues get fixed. As mentioned, iOS 15.1 is already in beta testing, so you'd imagine that fixes are on the way.No matter when you upgrade, though, you’ll have plenty of new features to enjoy with iOS 15. It’s a welcome addition that will feel right at home on your iPhone."
23,iPhone 12 Pro Max,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-12-pro-max,"Price: $1,099 Display: 6.7 inches (2778 x 1284) Colors: Silver, Graphite, Gold, Pacific Blue CPU: A14 Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB Rear cameras: 12MP wide (f/1.6), 12MP ultra-wide (f/2.4), 12MP telephoto (f/2.2) Zoom: 2.5x optical/12x digital Front camera: 12MP TrueDepth (f/2.2) 5G: sub-6Ghz, mmWave Battery: 3,687 mAh Battery life: 10 hours 53 minutes Size: 6.33 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches Weight: 8.03 ouncesThe iPhone 12 Pro Max is much more than just a big-screen version of the iPhone 12 Pro. With its 6.7-inch display, this is the biggest display ever on an iPhone. But the iPhone 12 Pro Max (from $1,099) lives up to its name in other ways, with an even more advanced camera than the regular iPhone 12 Pro and considerably longer battery life.Of course, you get the same blazing fast A14 Bionic chip and 5G connectivity as all the other iPhone 12 models, but this is the Apple phone to get if you want the best of everything. Is all this worth an extra $100 over the regular Pro? Absolutely.In fact, based on my testing, this is the top iPhone 12 of the range, assuming the big screen is right for you. If you're on the fence about that, check out our iPhone 12 Pro vs iPhone 12 Pro Max comparison. The iPhone 12 Pro Max topped our Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones in multiple categories, and used to be our number 1 pick for the best phones. However the iPhone 13 series is now here, and that spot now belongs to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. The new iPhone line also means the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max have been discontinued, meaning it may be hard to buy one new from now on. But nevertheless, here's the full lowdown on the iPhone 12 Pro Max.The iPhone 12 Pro Max came out November 13, 2020 with a starting price of $1,099/£1,099 for 128GB of storage. Upgrading to 256GB costs $1,199/£1,199, and the 512GB version costs $1,399/£1,399.The iPhone 12 Pro Max generally costs $100/£100 more than the regular iPhone 12 Pro regardless of the storage. Note that the iPhone 12 Pro Max does not come with a charger. A fast 20W charger costs $19 and Apple's MagSafe charger costs $39. See our iPhone 12 deals page for the latest discounts from retailers and all the major wireless carriers. If you buy your iPhone 12 Pro Max from Apple, for example, you can get up to $525 off the cost of the new iPhone by trading in your own device. (Only newer models fetch that high of a return, though — a two-year-old iPhone XS Max fetches you a $320 rebate from Apple.)The iPhone 12 Pro Max is a beast of a phone compared to the regular iPhone 12 Pro. It’s really the difference between having a flagship phone you can comfortably use with one hand and, well, not. But in exchange you get a much more expansive and immersive display, which not only fits more content on the display at once but gives you a bigger keyboard for typing and a mini movie theater in your pocket. The iPhone 12 Pro Max looks more premium than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. And that’s because of the new phone’s sleeker-looking flat edges. The polished gleaming gold stainless steel on my unit was particularly eye-catching. It’s the smartphone equivalent of jewelry. However, the finish picks up fingerprints in a hurry.Besides gold, the other color options include the more ho-hum silver and graphite, as well as the head-turning Pacific Blue I really like on the regular iPhone 12 Pro.The notch on the iPhone 12 Pro remains pretty large, but the TrueDepth camera still comes in very handy for Face ID. I just wish Apple found a way to integrate Touch ID in the display or the power button like it did for the new iPad Air. At 6.33 x 3.07 x 0.29 inches at 8.03 ounces, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a bit heavier than its predecessor. But you get a bigger display in roughly the same size, as Apple trimmed the borders around the screen. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is also tougher this time around. You get a Ceramic Shield display up front that’s rated for four times the drop performance as well as a better IP68 water resistance rating that goes down to 6 meters instead of 4 meters.With its 6.7-inch OLED display, the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s OLED panel is smaller but brighter than the 6.9-inch Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. When watching Stranger Things, I enjoyed an explosion of colors that almost made me forget I was holding a phone. The iPhone 12 Pro Max also happens to offer the most color-accurate display we’ve ever tested. The panel registered 0.07 on the Delta-E test, where 0 is perfect. The Note 20 Ultra notched 0.24.The iPhone 12 Pro Max’s display averaged 654 nits in our lab tests, compared to a slightly higher 662 nits for the Galaxy. But outdoors we found the iPhone’s screen easier to read in direct sunlight. The only thing missing from the iPhone 12 Pro Max is a smooth 120Hz rate, which would have made for smoother scrolling and even better gameplay like it does on the latest Samsung flagships. Here’s hoping for the iPhone 13.The iPhone 12 Pro Max offers the best cameras on any phone, and that’s saying something considering how good the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and Pixel 5 are.The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a larger main sensor than the iPhone 12 Pro, which is designed to deliver an 87 percent improvement in low light conditions vs the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The main lens on the iPhone 12 Pro Max also features a fast f/1.6 aperture and a LiDAR sensor for faster auto focus.You also get a 2.5x optical zoom from the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 12MP telephoto lens, which is behind the Note 20 Ultra’s 5x zoom but is better than the 2x on the iPhone 12 Pro. As you'll see in this gallery of iPhone 12 Pro Max images, the camera does a superb job in low light; I've never been able to get good shot of the moon until I used this phone. The moon itself could be clearer, but the surrounding clouds are remarkably sharp.The iPhone 12 Pro Max camera's Smart HDR 3 capability also did an amazing job capturing a challenging scene of a river in the background of several trees with a complex mix of sunlight and shadows.For camera comparisons, let’s start with this photo of mums captured by the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The iPhone’s shot is a brighter and richer yellow, while the Pixel 5 shot turns the flowers more gold. There’s no pop to the Pixel photo.The iPhone 12 Pro also beats the Pixel 5 in this shot of produce. There’s much more of a sheen to the peppers in the iPhone’s image. Google’s photo looks flat and dull by comparison. The iPhone 12 and Pixel 5 were more evenly matched in this portrait. The iPhone does a better job rendering my face, especially in the shadow. However, the yellow in my Star Wars shirt looks more vibrant and there’s more contrast overall with the Pixel. How about zoom? At 7x, the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s photo of this mural looks ok, while the Pixel 5’s version looks like a watercolor painting. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra has the sharper and more powerful zoom. At 12x you clearly make out the text way across the street on the fish market sign and even the license plate numbers on the cars. Plus, the Note 20 Ultra can keep going all the way to 50x.When it comes to low-light performance, the Pixel 5 has the edge in this Christmas tree shot. The greens are richer and you can make out more detail in the jade pieces. The iPhone 12 Pro Max’s image looks more washed out.Outdoors, the iPhone 12 Pro Max gets the nod, as it captures a bit more detail in the pumpkin and flowers. The Pixel 5’s shot is brighter but there’s a bit of a film over it.In this selfie, both the iPhone 12 Pro and Pixel 5 capture satisfying images, but they excel in different ways. The Pixel 5's shot offers more detail in my stubble and shirt, while the iPhone 12's shot is a bit warmer and delivers more even lighting across my face. Last but not least, this Night Mode shot shows how Apple's LiDAR sensor gives it an advantage. It can pull off portraits in night mode, while the Pixel 5 cannot. The result is that my face is much more in focus in the iPhone 12 Pro Max shot. The iPhone 12 Pro Max uses what’s called sensor shift stabilization to keep things steady, as opposed to optical image stabilization. But the results were still quite impressive. Even when walking at a brisk pace, the iPhone 12 Pro Max did a superb job keeping this park footage smooth, even if some lens flare crept in from the sun.And this sweeping panorama of the Manasquan river recorded by the iPhone 12 Pro Max looks absolutely gorgeous. You easily make out lots of ripples in the water, and the wisps of clouds against the blue sky look well defined. This is thanks to the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s Dolby Vision HDR support for video.Even at 2.5x the fidelity is excellent. When it comes to sheer performance, the A14 Bionic processor in the iPhone 12 Pro Max, paired with 6GB of RAM, has no equal. When playing the Arena fighting game, I kicked, slashed and impaled enemies with abandon and the gameplay remained as fluid and smooth as a console.The iPhone 12 Pro Max also outperformed the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra on the 3D Mark Wild Life graphics benchmark. Apple’s handset notched 41 frames per second, compared to just 24 fps for the Galaxy.As expected, the iPhone 12 Pro Max also blew away the Android competition on Geekbench 5. Apple’s phone hit 4,111 on the multi-core test and 1,603 on single core. Compare that to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, whose Snapdragon 865 Plus chip scored just 3,294 and 985.On our own video editing test. It took the iPhone 12 Pro Max just 28 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p, compared to 1 minute and 16 seconds for the Note 20 Ultra.The iPhone 12 Pro Max supports every flavor of 5G, including sub-6GHz and mmWave. I tested the phone on T-Mobile’s network, and saw solid speeds in central New Jersey — but nothing blazing.Using the Speedtest.net app, the iPhone 12 Pro Max maxed out at 211 Mbps for downloads and 77.5 Mbps for uploads. Like other iPhone 12 models, the iPhone 12 Pro Max can automatically switch to 4G via its Smart Data Mode. This comes in handy mostly when the screen is off, such as when you’re streaming music. One of the biggest reasons to splurge on the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the extra endurance you get from its larger battery.On the Tom’s Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over 5G, the iPhone 12 Pro Max lasted 10 hours and 53 minutes. That’s nearly two hours longer than the regular iPhone 12 Pro, which endured for 9:06. Samsung’s Galaxy Note 20 Ultra was slightly behind the 12 Pro Max with a runtime of 10:26 over 5G, which dropped to 7:59 with the 120Hz display mode on.Like the rest of the iPhone 12 lineup, Apple doesn’t include a charger in the box with the 12 Pro Max. That might be the green thing to do, as Apple has argued, but it’s also annoying, especially if you want to fast charge your phone.A $19 20W fast charger will get a drained iPhone 12 Pro Max to just under 50% in 30 minutes. But MagSafe is getting more attention, because it works with the magnets in the back of the iPhone 12 Pro Max to easily attach a charger. This $39 charger is 15W, which is slower, but it’s twice as fast as previous iPhone wireless chargers.Just keep in mind that you’ll need a power brick and MagSafe adapter, as they’re sold separately. The iPhone 12 Pro Max also works with a growing array of MagSafe accessories, including cases and wallets you can attach, as well as Apple’s $129 MagSafe Duo charger that juices your iPhone and Apple Watch simultaneously. Again, though, you'll need to spring for a 20W charger for this accessory to work.The iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPhone 12 Pro share most of the same features, but there are some key differences. While both flagship phones offer Apple's A14 Bionic chip, 5G and OLED displays, the iPhone 12 Pro Max's 6.7-inch screen is a lot larger than the 6.1-inch panel on the iPhone 12 Pro.In addition, the iPhone 12 Pro Max offers a bigger optical zoom than the iPhone 12 Pro (2.5x vs 2x) and larger digital zoom (12x vs 10x). The iPhone 12 Pro also benefits from having a larger sensor for its main wide camera, which lets in more light.Other than the larger display, the biggest reason to get the iPhone 12 Pro Max over the regular iPhone 12 Pro is the longer battery life. The iPhone 12 Pro Max has a strong competitor in the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, which features powerful dual telephoto cameras for up to 10x optical zoom. It also features a more dynamic 120Hz AMOLED display, longer battery life and even S Pen support. However, the S21 Ultra costs $100 more to start and it falls a bit behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max in terms of performance and overall image quality.See our in-depth Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra vs iPhone 12 Pro Max face-off to see which phone is right for your needs. The iPhone 12 Pro Max lives up to its name in a few key ways. You get a much bigger display than the regular iPhone 12 Pro and much longer battery life. Personally, I didn’t find that the Max’s larger camera sensor produced much better looking images than what you get from other iPhone 12 models, but it is nice that you get a more powerful zoom.It really comes down to whether you want a more compact phone or you really like big screens. I fall into the latter camp, but you won’t go wrong with either iPhone 12 Pro model. As for the Android competition, the iPhone 12 Pro Max put them all on notice with generally better cameras and faster performance. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is a great alternative with its more powerful zoom and dynamic 120Hz display, but the iPhone 12 Pro Max is still the superior phone overall. The iPhone 12 Pro Max remains a great phone even a year after launch. It's just going to be much harder to buy now that the iPhone 13 Pro Max is on sale. The iPhone 13 Pro Max improves on the 12 Pro Max in several ways though, so it is worth the extra money if you can't find the older phone in stock anywhere now it's been discontinued."
24,iPhone 11 Pro Max,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro-max,"The iPhone 11 Pro Max isn't just the best phone around, it's the phone I'd buy with my own money. Yes, the regular $699 iPhone 11 is a fantastic value, but the iPhone 11 Pro Max ($1,099) has a more dynamic OLED display compared with the iPhone 11's LCD. I also like having the third lens on the iPhone 11 Pro Max for telephoto zoom, which the iPhone 11 lacks. And as much as I like the smaller iPhone 11 Pro — which shares all the key features with the Max — I prefer the iPhone 11 Pro Max for its bigger screen and longer battery life. Apple should have included more storage to start, and I'm getting tired of that notch. But as you'll see in this in-depth iPhone 11 Pro Max review, it's the best iPhone for now. Editor's note: Apple has discontinued the iPhone 11 Pro Max (and its successor, the iPhone 12 Pro Max). The company's latest big-screen device is the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which has even better cameras and a 6.7-inch, 120Hz display, and is our new top pick among the best phones. Read our full iPhone 13 Pro Max review.The iPhone 11 Pro Max is now available and went on sale Sept. 20. The phone starts at a fairly steep $1,099 ($45.79 per month) but can be had for as little as $499 ($20.79) if you trade in an iPhone XS Max. (Older iPhones fetch a smaller trade-in value from Apple.) The iPhone 11 Pro Max comes with 64GB of storage. A 256GB model sells for $1,249 and the 512GB version costs $1,449. It's worth noting that the Galaxy Note 10 and Note 10 Plus come with 256GB standard, which is quadruple the storage. If you’re buying the iPhone 11 Pro Max in the UK, prices start at £1,149 for 64GB of storage, then £1,299 for 128GB and £1,499 for 256GB. Apple is running a trade-in offer if you’re willing to give them your current phone in part-exchange, meaning that you can get the iPhone 11 Pro Max for as low as £859 depending on your existing phone's value.Be sure to check out our iPhone 11 deals page for the latest discounts.The iPhone 11 Pro Max has a look from the back that says ""Come at me, Android."" The three camera lenses are so large that I feel like something's about to launch out of them. I do like the matte glass finish on the back, which is downright refreshing compared with glossy, smudge-prone phablets like the Galaxy Note 10 and Huawei P30 Pro.I could see why the iPhone 11 Pro Max might be jealous of the regular iPhone 11. It comes in four colors to the iPhone 11's six. And instead of fun hues like green, purple and yellow, Apple sticks with more conservative options for the iPhone 11 Pro Max that befit its pro-user status. These include the midnight-green color on our review unit (which frankly looks gray). The midnight green only really shines through on the stainless-steel band and in the rings around the cameras. Space gray (which is darker), silver and gold round out the options.The iPhone 11 Pro Max looks the same from the front as the iPhone XS Max. The notch toward the top, which houses the Face ID TrueDepth camera, is still distracting but I've gotten used to it.At 6.2 x 3.06 x 0.32 inches and 7.97 ounces, the iPhone 11 Pro Max continues to be a handful. It's heavier than the 7.34-ounce iPhone XS Max and also a bit thicker. The Galaxy Note 10 Plus, which has a larger 6.8-inch screen, is a full ounce lighter at 6.9 ounces and it's also slightly narrower and slimmer at 6.4 x 3 x 0.31 inches.Speaking of intimidating, Apple says that the front and back of the iPhone 11 Pro Max have the toughest glass in a smartphone. However, the regular iPhone 11 cracked on the first drop in our drop test from 3.5 feet on a sidewalk. We would invest in a case if you're worried about breakage.By the same token, some iPhone 11 Pro owners have complained that their screens have scratched easily. We have not encountered any issues with our review unit. But if you're concerned about your phone picking up scuffs or scratches we would invest in a screen protector.Apple has improved the IP68 water resistance on the iPhone 11 Pro Max; the phone can withstand being submerged in 4 meters of water for 30 minutes (up from 2 meters on the iPhone XS Max). That makes it more durable than any other flagship phone against liquids, earning it the top spot in our list of the best waterproof phones.If you're on the fence between the iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone 11, don't bring both phones outside. You'll notice the huge difference in brightness that I did. In fact, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display vastly outshined the Galaxy Note 10 Plus, too, when I put both phablets side by side.When watching the Star Wars Episode 9 Trailer: The Rise of Skywalker on both the iPhone 11 Pro Max and last year's iPhone XS Max, I could make out more gradations of color in Princess Leia's hair as she hugged Rey. This is likely thanks to the extended dynamic range offered by the improved panel on the iPhone 11 Pro Max.Our lab results backed up my real-world impressions, as the iPhone 11 Pro Max turned in an average nit reading of 761 nits, compared with 652 nits for the iPhone 11 and 686 for the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The iPhone 11 Pro Max's panel isn't the most colorful, registering 118.6% of the sRGB color gamut, compared with 124.6% in the Note 10 Plus' Natural screen mode. The OnePlus 7 Pro hit 180%. Regarding color accuracy, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's display registered a Delta-E score of 0.28 (where 0 is perfect). That's stellar, but not quite as good as the Galaxy Note 10 Plus (0.25) and OnePlus 7 Pro (0.18).The sound on the iPhone 11 Pro Max is just as bright as the visuals, as there's now spatial audio with Dolby Atmos support. When watching the trailer for Yesterday, Jack's cover of The Beatles famous track had more dimension to it through the iPhone 11 Pro Max compared with the iPhone XS Max. The guitar strings and vocals were much more present, while they sounded flatter on last year's phone.Although Apple has taken a back seat to Android camera phones over the past couple of years, Apple has regained its footing — and then some— with the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The new phone offers three stellar 12-MP rear cameras: a wide-angle, a 2x telephoto with wider aperture that lets in more light than before and an ultra-wide camera with a 120-degree field of view.Check out the many photo comparisons below, as well as our iPhone 11 Pro vs Pixel 4 camera face-off to see how the two phones compare in various situations. While you're shooting with the standard-wide camera, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's camera interface shows you a live preview outside the frame of what you could fit into your shot if you engaged ultra-wide mode. It's a nice touch and I found myself switching to that mode several times during my testing to get a more dramatic shot.We put the iPhone 11 Pro Max up against the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus' ultra-wide camera in this photograph in Bryant Park, and Apple's camera delivers a warmer pic and more natural hues. However, you'll see sharper details in the Note 10 Plus' photo.The other big new feature for the iPhone 11 Pro Max's camera is Night Mode, which kicks in automatically when the iPhone detects more than 10 lux of available light. In this comparison with the Note 10 Plus, Apple soundly beats Samsung's effort. The Note 10 Plus' shot is entirely too grainy, while the wood and decorations look more realistic on the iPhone 11 Pro Max.We took another photo in low light with lots of people in the frame with the iPhone 11 Pro (which has the same camera as the Pro Max) and the Pixel 3, and it was a much closer contest. The Pixel 3 captured a brighter scene overall, but I prefer the way it handles the lights in the trees, and the wood in the table and surrounding fence looks more natural. It's a night shot that looks more like night, while the Pixel 3 washes some things out, like the man's shirt in the middle of the frame, as well as his beer.The iPhone 11 Pro Max's camera also boasts a new Smart HDR feature that leverages machine learning to recognize people and ensure that details and highlights and faces look their best.In this portrait of my colleague Shaun, the Note 10 Plus pretty much ruins the shot with its washed-out face, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max's camera delivers a warmer skin tone and better detail around the subject's cheeks. The skin is a bit too smooth on the Note 10 Plus, although Samsung's camera offers more detail in Shaun's hair and in his tattoos. I didn't include many comparisons with Google's Pixel 3 because the Pixel 4 is on the way, but I thought this statue photo provided an interesting contrast between Apple's and Google's approach to photography. The Pixel 3's image is detailed but on the dark side, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max's brighter pic does a better job rendering the stone, giving you a better sense of texture.With this indoor shot taken at an Oyster Bar with a moderate amount of light, I give the edge to the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The lights lining the walls look more distinct and as you zoom in the lettering on the menus appears sharper. Plus, all the different neutral shades in the tiles look better in Samsung's photo than on the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which look more gray.Finally, I pitted the iPhone 11 Pro Max against the Galaxy Note 10 Plus in this photo of a cookie, and it's not even close. From the darker brown of the cookie to the more colorful M&M's on top, Apple's camera simply took a more delicious shot. The iPhone 11 Pro's camera gets even better with Apple's Deep Fusion feature. Debuting in iOS 13.2, Deep Fusion performs pixel-by-pixel photo processing to deliver even more detail and better textures along with less noise. As with Night Mode, you don't have to enter a separate mode to reap the benefits of this feature.We put Deep Fusion through its paces in a series of photos with the iPhone 11 Pro (with Deep Fusion) and iPhone 11 Pro Max (without), and you can see that there are some tangible benefits. For example, you can make our more stubble in my colleague Rami's face, as well as more detail on the inside of his hoodie.Apple has focused on improving its video recording with the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and it shows. There's now extended dynamic range for better highlight details along with cinematic stabilization for smoother footage.To put the iPhone 11 Pro Max to the test, I put it up against the Note 10 Pro as I walked through the park. At first, the Note 10 Pro's cameras seem better with more vibrant greens in the grass, but once you look closer, you'll see that the iPhone 11 Pro Max offers better detail. Plus, the iPhone had fewer problems with lens flare.With iOS 13, it's now easier to start shooting videos on the fly, with the phone's QuickTake video feature. You just press and hold the shutter button, and if you want to keep shooting you slide your finger to the right.The front camera on the iPhone 11 Pro Max gets several upgrades from the iPhone XS Max, including a sharper sensor (12MP vs. 7MP) and a wider view to fit more subjects (or just more of the scene) into your shots. A clever software trick automatically engages the wide view when you flip the phone to landscape mode.To add some levity to video selfies, the iPhone 11 Pro Max lets you record slow-motion videos with the front camera at up to 120fps — a feature Apple calls ""slofies.""I gave it a shot by recording myself in front of a trickling fountain, and the background effect is  mesmerizing. So despite the groan-inducing name, this feature could prove viral as people get creative with it.This is going to sound like a broken record, but Apple has the world's fastest phone once more, thanks to its powerful A13 Bionic processor. This chip packs a CPU and GPU that are both 20% faster than last year’s A12, along with a neural engine for machine learning that's also 20% faster.I noticed this speed difference when opening apps like Asphalt 9. The iPhone 11 Pro Max took a little less than 4 seconds, compared with 8 seconds for the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. Mortal Kobat also loaded a couple of seconds faster on the iPhone 11 Pro Max.On Geekbench 5, a relatively new benchmark that measures overall performance, the iPhone 11 Pro Max notched a single-core mark of 1,334 and a multicore score of 3,517, The Galaxy Note 10 Plus scored 736 and 2,691 respectively, while the OnePlus 7 Pro was also behind with 744 and 2,802. Last year's iPhone XS Max scored 1,106 and 2,773. To test graphics performance we ran GFXBench, and once again the iPhone 11 Pro Max lapped Android phones. On the Aztech Ruins High Tier off-screen test, the iPhone 11Pro Max hit 1657 frames (25 fps), compared with 1,058 frames (16 fps) for the Galaxy Note 10.The iPhone 11 Pro Max didn't perform as well on 3DMark, another graphics benchmark. On the Slingshot Extreme Unlimited portion of the test, Apple's phone notched 5,974, while the Galaxy Note 10 Plus and OnePlus 7 Pro both cleared 6,200.We gauge real-world performance across iOS and Android phones using our own video- editing test. We time how long it takes to transcode a 4K video to 1080p in the Adobe Rush app after applying an effect and transition. The iPhone 11 Pro Max took just 45 seconds to complete this task versus 1:34 for the Note 10 Plus. On this test, however, last year's iPhone XS Max was just as speedy.Apple has answered one of the few complaints I had about the iPhone XS Max by giving the iPhone 11 Pro Max more juice. Thanks to a more efficient A13 chip and display, as well as a bigger battery, this new phone lasts more than an hour longer on our battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE at 150 nits of screen brightness.While the iPhone XS Max lasted a pretty good 10 hours and 38 minutes on our test, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's battery lasted an average of 11 hours and 54 minutes, which lands the 11 Pro Max on our list of phones with the best battery life.To put this runtime in perspective, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus lasted an average of 11 hours and 9 minutes, while the OnePlus 7 Pro was more than 2 hours behind with 9:31.It's worth noting that the smaller iPhone 11 Pro lasted only 10 hours and 5 minutes on our battery test, so if you really care about endurance you should go for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.When it comes to charging, the good news is that Apple finally includes a fast charger in the box. The bad news is that this somewhat bulky 18-watt adapter isn't as speedy as the top Android phones. After 30 minutes of charging, the iPhone 11 Pro Max reached 48% in 30 minutes. (The regular iPhone 11 Pro got to 55% in 30 minutes, but it also has a smaller battery).That's great, but the Galaxy Note 10 Plus got to 65% in the same amount of time with its 25-watt charger and the OnePlus 7 Pro hit 60 with its 40W charger.The iPhone 11 Pro Max gives you a lot of phone for the money, but it's not future-proof, and that's because it doesn't support 5G networks. Although we've seen spotty 5G performance in our early tests, 5G phones like the Galaxy S10 5G and Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G can exceed 1Gbps download speeds.The problem is that 5G networks are still a year away from rolling out nationwide nationwide, and that the modems needed to support multiple 5G bands were not available to Apple in time for this launch; the next iPhone in 2020 should have a versatile 5G modem from Qualcomm.In the meantime, you'll have to make due with 4G LTE across the major carriers. The iPhone 11 Pro Max features the most advanced 4x4 MIMO antennas, compared with 2x2 antennas for the cheaper iPhone 11. On T-Mobile's network, we saw a notable delta in throughput, with the iPhone 11 Pro Max averaging 12.5 Mbps down and 3.5 Mbps up in central New Jersey, compared with 9 Mbps and 1.5 Mbps up for the iPhone 11. Assuming you have a Wi-Fi 6 router, the iPhone 11 Pro Max should deliver faster Wi-Fi speeds when connected to those networks.One wireless feature that will be available after launch on Sept. 30 is Ultra Wideband via Apple's new U1 chip. This technology can pinpoint the exact location of other iPhone 11 devices with a U1 chip inside, and there are rumors that Apple is working on a Tile-like object tracker powered by the U1. For now, the only application to benefit from the U1 chip is AirDrop; you can point your phone toward another U1-powered iPhone to share content over the air.For now, iPhone 11 devices ship with Apple's new iOS 13 software, and although Apple didn't make any groundbreaking changes to its mobile OS, there are several handy improvements. Dark Mode makes reading content for longer stretches easier on the eyes, and there's a redesigned Reminders app that makes it easier to create and organize your various to-do lists. The large numbers next to various lists provide extra incentives to knock things off.Other iOS 13 highlights include Sign in with Apple, which is designed to be a more private way to sign into various apps than Facebook or Google. And there's a rebuilt Maps app with street-level images via a new Look Around feature.This fall iOS 14 will bring much bigger changes to the iPhone interface, including widgets on the home screen a tidier new App Library view, pinned conversations in messages and a Translate app. iOS 14 also brings a more compact design for Siri and spatial audio support for the AirPods Pro for more immersive sound.I recommend that you check out our iPhone 11 vs. iPhone 11 Pro vs. iPhone 11 Pro Max comparison for more details, but here's the gist if you're trying to figure out which new iPhone to buy. At $699, the 6.1-inch iPhone 11 gives you the most bang for your buck, including great dual cameras and the same handy Night mode and fast A13 Bionic chip found on the pricier models.The $999 iPhone 11 Pro is smaller than the iPhone 11 at 5.8 inches, making it a good choice for those who want to use a phone with one hand. And you get a third camera on the back for telephoto zoom and a richer OLED display, compared with the iPhone 11's LCD.The reasons to step up to the $1,099 iPhone 11 Pro Max are its best-in-class battery life and ginormous 6.5-inch display.The iPhone 11 Pro Max is the closest Apple has come to the perfect smartphone. The cameras truly are a leap forward and put the company ahead of both Samsung and Google — at least for now. And the bright OLED display outshines most other phones. The iPhone 11 Pro Max also sports the fastest phone processor you can get in its A13 chip and the longest battery life we've seen from any iPhone.Although some may want to wait for Apple to roll out a 5G-capable iPhone 12 this fall, there are very few reasons to skip the iPhone 11 Pro Max if you want the best flagship phone now. My only big complaint is the 64GB of included storage (it should be at least double), and this phone is a bit heavier than its predecessor.When you look at the phone landscape, there are plenty of great options, but right now the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the pinnacle of handsets."
25,iPhone 12 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-12-pro,"Price: $999, £999 Display: 6.1 inches OLED (2532 x 1170) Colors: Silver, Graphite, Gold, Pacific Blue CPU: A14 Bionic Storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB Rear camera: 12MP wide (f/1.6), 12MP ultra-wide (f/2.4), 12MP telephoto (f/2.0) Zoom: 2x optical/10x digital Front camera: 12MP TrueDepth (f/2.2) Battery: 2,815 mAh Battery life: 9:06 (5G), 11:24 (4G) Size: 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.29 inches Weight: 6.66 ouncesThe iPhone 12 Pro represents a big leap, both inside and out. On the inside, there’s fast 5G connectivity and the world’s first 5nm processor that blows away all Android phones. And on the outside, the iPhone 12 Pro is made both tougher with a 6.1-inch Ceramic Shield display and sleeker with a flat-edge design.But the real reason to get the $999 iPhone 12 Pro over the $799 iPhone 12 or $699 iPhone 12 mini is the cameras. The iPhone 12 Pro offers not only a telephoto lens for optical zoom but a new LiDAR scanner that speeds up autofocus and enables Night mode portraits. Like the other new iPhone 12 models, the iPhone 12 Pro ditches the in-box charger and picks up support for MagSafe wireless charging.After testing the iPhone 12 Pro, I believe it’s worth the splurge for serious photographers, but heavy 5G use drains the battery quickly. Others may want the iPhone 12 Pro Max, which offers a larger 6.7-inch inch display, even more powerful cameras and longer battery life for $100 more. While still a fantastic phone that was one of best camera phones around and one of the best phones overall at launch, the iPhone 12 Pro has now been succeeded by the iPhone 13 series, and specifically the iPhone 13 Pro. As a result the 12 Pro has been discontinued. You may still find some new ones knocking around, but retailers' supplies are likely very limited if they have any left at all.If you're unable to find a 12 Pro on sale, the 13 Pro is probably now your best option since the experience is more refined and the price is identical to the 12 Pro's when it was new. The Samsung Galaxy S21 is a viable Android alternative, which starts at $799 and features a more powerful zoom and 120Hz display. But as you'll see in my iPhone 12 Pro review, it's still a fantastic device even as it enters retirement.The iPhone 12 Pro is widely available after its release last October. The phone starts at $999, which is the same price as the iPhone 11 Pro. However, now you get 128GB of storage, which is double last year’s amount and frankly overdue.If you want more storage, you can get 256GB for $1,099 and 512GB for $1,299.Over in the U.K., the iPhone 12 Pro starts at £999 for the 128GB model, then jumps to £1,099 for 256GB of storage, and tops out at £1,299 for the 512GB handset. Bear in mind you can get £280 off the by trading in an older and eligible iPhone. Keep in mind that Apple does not include a charger in the iPhone 12 Pro box. You get only a USB-C to Lightning cable. If you want to charge the iPhone 12 Pro quickly, a 20W faster charger costs $19. The new MagSafe wireless charger costs $39, which we’ll get into later.The same is true in Britain, with the MagSafe charger costing £39 and the 20W wired charger coming in at £19. Check out the best iPhone 12 deals for latest discounts from retailers and carriers. If you buy your iPhone 12 Pro from Apple, you can get up to $525 off the price of your new device by trading in an iPhone 7 or later. (The new the phone, the more the rebate.)Now this is refreshing. Apple has moved away from the rounded design of the last few iPhones to a flat-edge look on the iPhone 12 Pro. The stainless steel sides feel more solid and less slippery than on the iPhone 11 Pro and are reminiscent of the iPhone 4 (in a good way). The flat edges are sharper than the curvier sides I’m used to, but I didn’t feel any discomfort.Another plus is that you get a bigger 6.1-inch display in nearly the same size chassis as the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro. That’s because Apple trimmed the bezels around the display. The result is a smartphone with more real estate that’s easier to use with one hand. The iPhone 12 Pro measures 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.29 inches and weighs 6.66 ounces compared to 5.67 x 2.81 x 0.32 inches and 6.63 ounces for the iPhone 11 Pro.If you’re worried about damage, the front display on the iPhone 12 Pro now uses Ceramic Shield glass, which is rated for four times better drop performance than the iPhone 11 Pro. Apple pulled this off by growing nano-ceramic crystals within the glass matrix. Apple also claims that the back glass is 2x tougher than the iPhone 11 Pro.We’ll be putting these claims to the test with our own drop tests. However, both the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 performed exceedingly well in EverythingApplePro's torture test on YouTube. The front glass did not crack at hip or shoulder height when dropped. It took a drop from 10 feet to crack the iPhone 12 Pro's panel. The iPhone 12 Pro is tough in another way: this phone has a IP68 water resistance rating of 6 meters (19.7 feet), which is considerably deeper than the 2-meter (6.5 feet) rating on the iPhone 11 Pro. In other words, you don’t have to worry if the iPhone 12 Pro takes a dive in the deep end of the pool.The iPhone 12 Pro comes in four colors: Graphite, Silver, Gold and Pacific Blue. I tested the Pacific Blue model, and I appreciate that the matte glass back did not pick up fingerprints easily.Yup, the notch is still here on the iPhone 12 Pro, which is not the full-screen experience I was hoping for. But the iPhone 12 Pro does deliver a more immersive viewing experience than the iPhone 11 Pro because of the larger 6.1-inch panel and slimmer bezels.The resolution is slightly higher on the iPhone 12 Pro at 2532 x 1170 pixels and 460 dpi, compared to 2532 x 1170 pixels and 458 ppi for the iPhone 11 Pro.When watching the trailer for Wonder Woman 1984, the iPhone 12 Pro, her golden bracelets gleamed as she tried to fight off Kristen Wiig’s Cheetah, and the red, white and blue fireworks that exploded around Gal Gadot and Chris Pine really popped.The iPhone 12 Pro’s panel reproduced 115.6% of the sRGB color gamut and 81.9% of the more demanding DCI-P3 color space. That’s slightly below the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s OLED screen in Natural mode (121.5%/86.1%). The Note 20 Ulta’s screen is also a bit more accurate with a Delta-E rating of 0.24, compared to 0.28 for the iPhone 12 Pro.However, the iPhone 12 Pro’s display is brighter, averaging 742 nits on our light meter, compared to 662.7 nits for the Note 20 Ultra. We also found it easier to read the iPhone 12 Pro’s display in direct sunlight. What the iPhone 12 Pro display doesn’t have that is a fast refresh rate display. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, OnePlus 8T and other phones have 120Hz panels that enable smoother animations and faster scrolling. It’s not a deal breaker that this feature is missing from the latest iPhones but it is a bummer.The iPhone 12 Pro’s photography capabilities are so impressive that it’s almost an insult to call it a camera phone. Although the 12MP resolution remains the same on the wide, ultra-wide and telephoto lenses, there are a ton of upgrades here, starting with a faster f/1.6 aperture for the main camera, which results in 27% improved low-light performance.The iPhone 12 Pro’s photography capabilities are so impressive that it’s almost an insult to call it a camera phone.Other highlights include Night Mode for the Ultra Wide and TrueDepth (front) cameras, Deep Fusion on every camera for better detail and Smart HDR 3 for getting the best results in tricky lightning conditions.I took a bunch of photos compared to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and the iPhone 12 Pro won nearly every round. Take this shot of some mums and pumpkins on a bench, photographed at daytime in the shadows. The iPhone 12 Pro brings out more details in the pumpkins and especially in the flower petals, resulting in a sharper and brighter image.The iPhone 12 Pro also outperformed the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra when we tested both cameras at a nearby park. Samsung’s picture is overly bright in the leaves toward the top of the frame and blows out the sky a bit, while the iPhone 12 Pro delivers a deeper blue in the sky and more contrast overall.I was very impressed with how well the iPhone 12 Pro performed in this portrait. Check out the detail in my brown jacket; you can make out fine stitching even from a distance, which is Apple’s Magic Fusion at work. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra muddies those details and my face looks overly bright and smooth.The iPhone 12 Pro does have a camera weakness, and that’s zoom. You get only 2x optical zoom, compared to 5x for the Note 20 Ultra. Check out the difference with both phones set to 10x digital zoom. The wood sign looks a lot blurrier on the iPhone 12 Pro’s shot, as does the grass and garbage can in the background. And the Note 20 Ultra can go much further than this, all the way out to 50x.The iPhone 12 Pro and Note 20 Ultra were pretty evenly matched in this shot of produce. Both images are sharp, but the highlights in the peppers on Samsung’s pic are more pleasing to the eye. The tomatoes in the background, though, look richer on the iPhone 12 Pro.The Night Mode on the iPhone 12 Pro is improved because it’s now available on the Ultra Wide camera as well as the telephoto and wide lenses. And I found that the iPhone 12 Pro captured Night Mode images more quickly than on the iPhone 11 Pro.When snapping a photo of a glass pumpkin next to a candle in close to complete darkness, the iPhone 12 Pro took 3 seconds, compared to 6 seconds for the Note 20 Ultra. That’s a much longer time to hold the camera still. However, while the iPhone’s shot is brighter, it’s also grainier.The TrueDepth camera on the iPhone 12 Pro gets a big upgrade with Night Mode. It will turn on automatically when you don’t have enough light, and I noticed a big difference. In this selfie, taken in a room at dusk with no other lights on (other than my computer monitor), the iPhone 12 Pro captured a much brighter image. You can make out more details in face and hair, as well as in my blue blue-and-gray shirt.If you really want more creative freedom, the iPhone 12 Pro will get support for Apple ProRAW later this year, which will let you shoot in RAW format. This deep image file will be editable in the Photos app and other professional photo apps.The iPhone 12 Pro is the world’s first phone that can shoot footage in HDR with Dolby Vision support. That means this handset can capture up to 700 million colors when recording videos. And the frame rate goes up to 60 fps in 4K. In addition, you can watch and edit the Dolby Vision HDR video you shoot right on the iPhone 12 Pro.I was blown away by the footage the iPhone 12 captured near the shore of the Manasquan river. Right from the opening frame, I could make out the gradations of color in the sky, and the green moss on the left side of the path and the leaves as I panned up looked more vibrant than with the Note 20 Ultra’s camera.Another perk is that the iPhone 12 Pro’s larger aperture delivers better low-light video recording. And you can capture Night mode Time-lapses for dramatic looking footage — provided you use a tripod.To test out the iPhone 12 Pro’s low-light video recording, I captured some 4K footage at 60 fps in my front yard as the sun was coming up. The iPhone’s video looked brighter and sharper in the pathway, pumpkins and especially the yellow mums.The iPhone 12 Pro supports all the varieties of 5G, including sub-6GHz, mmWave and upcoming mid-band frequencies being rolled out by various carriers. The benefit of 5G is that you can enjoy faster downloads, as well as lower latency when playing games or when running real-time apps like augmented reality experiences.Apple adds on to the 5G experience in a couple of ways. Smart Data Mode can automatically switch from 5G to 4G LTE to save you battery life, such as when you’re streaming music with the screen off. You can also conduct full-HD FaceTime calls over 5G, which you couldn’t do before.In our testing over T-Mobile’s network, the iPhone 12 Pro topped out at 177 Mbps for downloads and 26.9 Mbps for uploads. Those speeds are okay, but they’re not much better than 4G LTE. If you want 2 Gbps speeds, your best best is Verizon’s 5G network right now, which has high-speed mmWave deployed in 51 cities and counting. Buy you’ll need to be in line of sight to a nearby node. (Verizon’s nationwide 5G network just went live in 1,800 cities, but speeds there aren’t as fast as mmWave.)As the world’s first 5nm chip in a handset, Apple claims that the iPhone 12 Pro has the fastest chip in a smartphone. Benchmarks and our own real-world tests back up that claim. In fact, Apple is just widening the gap at this point between the iPhone and Android phones.We transcoded a 4K video to 1080p in Adobe Premiere Rush app, and it took the iPhone 12 only 27 seconds. The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra was way behind at 1 minute and 16 seconds. The iPhone 11 Pro took 46 seconds.The iPhone 12 Pro also provided swift performance when playing Samurai Jack from Apple Arcade. Even with more than a dozen enemies on screen, the gameplay didn’t stutter as I threw ninja stars and swung my sword in every direction.On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the iPhone 12 Pro scored 1,595 on the single-core test and 3,880 on the multi-core test. By comparison, the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra’s Snapdragon 865 Plus chip scored 985 and 3294, respectively. The Asus Rog Phone 3, one of the most powerful Android phones we’ve reviewed, hit 3,393 on the multi-core test.To test the graphics performance on the iPhone 12 Pro, we ran the new 3DMark Wild Life benchmarks. It measures GPU performance by rendering demanding game scenes in real time. The iPhone 12 Pro scored 6,567 and 39 fps, compared to 4,164 and 24.9 fps for the Note 20 Ultra.We have a more in-depth iPhone 12 Pro benchmarks results comparison if you want to see how the iPhone 12 Pro compares to other phones and the previous iPhone 11 Pro..The iPhone 12 Pro includes a 2,815 mAh battery, which is smaller than the 3,046 mAh battery in the iPhone 11 Pro. Overall, we saw pretty good battery life in day-to-day use, but 5G can take a serious toll.On the Tom’s Guide battery test, which involves surfing the web at 150 nits of screen brightness over cellular, the iPhone 12 Pro lasted 9 hours and 6 minutes on T-Mobile’s 5G network. The similarly priced Galaxy Note 20 lasted 9 hours and 38 minutes over AT&T’s 5G network.When we switched over to 4G, the iPhone 12 Pro lasted a much longer 11 hours and 24 minutes. The handsets on our best phone battery life list all last more than 11 hours, but you shouldn’t have to toggle between 5G and 4G to get there. By comparison, the iPhone 11 Pro lasted 10:24 over 4G, but that had a smaller 5.8-inch display and (presumably) a smaller battery.We have a more in-depth iPhone 12 Pro battery life comparison with the iPhone 12 and other Android phones if you want to check it out. The iPhone 12 Pro can help you save battery life when you’re not surfing the web. A Smart Data mode can toggle switch between 5G and 4G automatically under certain conditions, such as when you’re streaming music with the screen turned off.Alas, Apple did not include a charger in the box with the iPhone 12 Pro in an effort to be more environmentally friendly. I get it — there are millions of existing charging bricks out there. But if you want the fastest possible charging speeds, you’re going to have to pay an extra $19 for a 20W charger, promising 50% capacity in 30 minutes.The iPhone 12 is behind the Android competition here. Samsung supports 25W charging on the Note 20 Ultra and 45W charging on the Galaxy S20 Ultra. And the OnePlus 65T does 65W charging.To take the guesswork out of wireless charging, Apple has introduced MagSafe for the iPhone 12 Pro and other new iPhone 12 models. Because the iPhone 12 Pro has magnets built into its back, the MagSafe charger ($39) easily snaps onto the phone and starts charging. This charger delivers 15W of power, taking the iPhone 12 Pro to just 39% in 30 minutes.There is a side benefit to MagSafe, and that’s the fact that you don’t have to deal with the Lightning connector, which can stop working properly over time. However, we found the charging to be slow. After 30 minutes, the iPhone 12 Pro got to just 31% capacity with MagSafe, and it took 52 minutes to get to 50%.There are MagSafe-ready cases available for the iPhone 12 Pro as well, and a MagSafe wallet you can snap on the back of your iPhone if you want to carry real credit cards and cash to complement Apple Pay.We don't recommend the $129 Apple MagSafe Duo. While it charges the iPhone 12 Pro and an Apple Watch simultaneously, it does so only at 11W when paired with a 20W charger. And even if you spring for a 30-watt charger, the iPhone 12 Pro will max out at 14W. The iPhone 12 faces stiff competition from the Samsung Galaxy S21, which features a dynamic 6.2-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and longer battery life. Plus, the S21 offers a more powerful 30x digital zoom. However, the iPhone 12 Pro offers faster performance, a more premium glass design (the S21 is plastic) and better image quality. The iPhone 12 Pro is a serious step up from the iPhone 11 Pro, but that’s not who this flagship is really for. It’s for those who own older iPhones who are looking to upgrade, such as the iPhone XS, iPhone X or iPhone 8. You get a bigger display in a design that’s just as compact, cameras that deliver astonishingly good results (especially in low light) and 5G connectivity.At this stage, fast 5G is not widespread, so you may not enjoy home-broadband-like speeds in your neck of the woods for some time. And even when you can get it, 5G can take a serious hit on the iPhone 12 Pro’s battery life. I’d like to see Apple get even more aggressive with its Smart Data mode to squeeze out more juice.The iPhone 12 Pro gives you double the storage in the regular iPhone 12, as well as its optical zoom and better auto-focus, and for me the $200 premium is well worth it. However, those who prefer a larger display should definitely check out the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. Overall, the iPhone 12 Pro beats every Android phone in its class in terms of performance and camera quality, even if it’s a step behind in battery life."
26,iPhone SE (2020),Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/apple-iphone-se-2020-review,"Price: $399/£419 CPU: A13 Bionic Storage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB Display: 4.7 inches (1334 x 750) Rear camera: 12MP (f/1.8) Front camera: 7MP (f/2.2) Video recording: 4K video up to 60 fps Water resistance: IP67 Battery life: Up to 13 hours video playback Wireless charging: Yes (Qi) Fast charging: Yes via optional 18W adapter Size: 5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 inches Weight: 5.22 ouncesThe iPhone SE 2020 remains one of the best phones for those on a budget, even more than a year after its release. For less than $400, you get Apple's A13 Bionic processor, delivering fast performance and camera capabilities you’d expect from a pricier phone. And it's all wrapped in a compact design.The iPhone SE also offers premium features you won’t find on some Android phones in its price range — including its metal-and-glass design, wireless charging and water resistance. Some old-school features are along for the rider here, too, such as Touch ID for unlocking the device (which can come in handy at a time when we're still wearing face masks).I just wish Apple trimmed the bezels on this phone and added a night mode for the camera. If that's too big a problem for you, then there is the iPhone 13 mini, or last year's iPhone 12 mini, which offer larger 5.4-inch displays and 5G, but for a few hundred more dollars. Some may want to wait until next year, as rumors suggest that an iPhone SE 3 with 5G is due out in early 2022. Regardless of how good the new iPhone 13 may look when it debuts, you can't deny that the iPhone SE 2020 remains one of the best phones you can buy for the money.The iPhone SE costs $399/£419, the same price it debuted at in April 2020. The $399 model features 64GB of storage for $399, but you can upgrade to the 128GB version for $449/£469 and to 256GB for $549/£569. Trade in your old device when you buy the iPhone SE, and you could get as much as $120 off your new phone, lowering the price to $279. You can also check out the best iPhone SE deals to see if there are additional savings available.The iPhone SE is available through all of the major carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon, as well as other carriers including Xfinity Mobile and Visible.I generally like the iPhone SE’s design — with one exception. On the plus side, it’s a very well made handset with the same sturdy glass-and-aluminum design of the iPhone 8. There are three color options for the iPhone SE: black, white and (Product)Red. I like how the aluminum band is color matched with the back of the device.I tried out the black model, which looks and feels sleek but did pick up smudges despite the oleophobic coating. You’ll probably want to opt for white if you want to hide fingerprints.Another plus to the iPhone SE: The whole design is almost comically compact compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max or the new iPhone 12 Pro Max. It’s the difference between barely noticing a phone is in your front pocket and having it bulge out. I also didn’t feel any discomfort when gaming for over 30 minutes at a time; I can’t say that about my iPhone 11 Pro Max.The iPhone SE measures 5.45 x 2.65 x 0.29 inches and weighs 5.22 ounces, which is smaller and narrower than the Google Pixel 4a but about the same weight. The Pixel 3a has a much bigger 5.81-inch edge-to-edge display with a hole punch cutout. However, unlike Google's budget phone, the iPhone SE 2020 has IP67 water resistance. That means it can be submerged in 1 meter of weather for up to 30 minutes. You also shouldn’t have to worry about coffee or soda spills with this phone.Unfortunately, the bezels around the iPhone SE’s screen look big and dated for a 2020 smartphone. I kept trying to zoom in on videos to no avail. I would have liked Apple to fit a larger display in the same size chassis.Another issue is that Haptic touch does not work on the lock screen of the iPhone SE for some reason. Unlike other iPhones, you can't long press on notifications to expand them on the lock screen.Although Apple has offered Face ID on all of its newer phones for the past couple of years, the new iPhone SE 2020 uses a Touch ID sensor underneath the display for unlocking the device. This same sensor can be used for authorizing App Store downloads, Apple Pay and entering passwords.Just like I remembered, the combo Touch ID/home button worked well, and you can choose the amount of haptic feedback you prefer when you press down. The Touch ID button has a very important — and unexpected — benefit right now as many are being ordered to wear face masks in public. You can still easily unlock your iPhone SE without having to take off your mask. Face ID won’t work with masks.A 4.7-inch screen on a modern-day phone may seem antiquated, but those shopping for one of the best small phones won’t be disappointed in this panel.I enjoyed checking out the Wonder Woman 1984 trailer on YouTube on the iPhone SE 2020’s Retina Display. The superhero’s gleaming red, blue and gold suit popped as she deflected bullets with her silver bracelet. The iPhone SE’s screen also did a good job rendering finer details in a Tiger King scene: I could make out individual whiskers on the majestic animal’s face.Just don’t expect a full HD picture. The iPhone SE’s display resolution is just 1334 x 750 pixels. We would prefer to see a 1080p display but it’s not too bad of a trade-off. The iPhone SE’s screen is bright, as it’s rated for 625 nits and scored an even higher 653 nits in our testing. It’s just a bit dimmer than the Pixel 4a’s 681 nits.I didn’t have any issues viewing the screen outdoors when surfing the web or taking photos. The panel also supports True Tone, which means it can automatically adjust the screen’s color temperature based on the ambient lighting conditions. Based on our tests, the iPhone SE’s display reproduces 111.2% of the sRGB color gamut, which just barely beats the 105.8% from the Pixel 4a’s OLED panel. The iPhone SE delivers accurate colors, too, achieving a Delta-E score of 0.2; a score of zero is perfect. The Pixel 4a’s screen scored 0.29.The iPhone SE 2020’s camera is so good that you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference between it and the iPhone 11 in many cases. The one exception is Night mode, which the iPhone SE simply does not have.Like the iPhone 8 before it, the iPhone SE features a single 12-megapixel rear camera and a 7MP front camera. You don’t get a ultra-wide angle lens like the iPhone 11 or a telephoto lens with optical zoom like the iPhone 12 Pro models. But the iPhone SE's A13 Bionic chip boosts its camera performance in several ways.For instance, you can take portraits using both the back and front camera on the iPhone SE, complete with Portrait Lighting effects and the ability to control the depth of field. The iPhone SE also benefits from Smart HDR for bringing out the highlights in faces.I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail in this iPhone SE photo of a man-made pond. You can make out the drops of water in the waterfall in the distance, and the greenery pops around the rock formations. The iPhone SE also did a great job capturing the black-and-white and orange-and-white fish in that pond, as well as the blue-green water.The iPhone SE held its own against the Pixel 3a in this photo of light pink cherry blossom flowers. The iPhone SE’s shot is warmer and brighter, but the Pixel 3a’s image is a bit more detailed and has more contrast.I also give the nod to the iPhone SE here with this portrait. My skin tone looks more natural and the bokeh effect looks very convincing. The Pixel’s manages to take a chunk out of the right side of my head. There is one small drawback to the iPhone SE when taking portraits, though; you have to get considerably closer to your subject than you do with the iPhone 11 Pro because the iPhone SE doesn’t have a telephoto lens. (You will be within 6 feet, which is not social-distancing friendly.)The iPhone SE pulled ahead in this photo of an Aperol Sprtiz cocktail. The overall image just looks brighter and more appetizing. I also like how the iPhone SE blurs out the background. The only strike against the iPhone here is that the tile looks more yellow than white; the Pixel 3a got that right.The one camera weakness for the iPhone SE is the lack of a Night Mode. In this photo taken outside at night, the Pixel 3a is able to render the trees in the foreground, the car in the street and the house in the background. You can barely make out anything in the iPhone SE’s shot. I don’t know if the iPhone SE could pull off a Night mode with a software upgrade, but it would be great to see Apple add the feature.If you're wondering how the iPhone SE's cameras measure up to a more recent device than the Pixel 3a, check out our Google Pixel 4a vs. iPhone SE face-off for a camera comparison to Google's current budget offering.On the video front, the iPhone SE can record 4K video at up to 60 fps, and you can enjoy extended dynamic range if you drop down the frame rate to 30 fps. This brings out more details in the shadows along with better highlights.While Android phone makers outfit their budget phones with weaker processors, the iPhone SE packs the same A13 Bionic chip as the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. This means you’ll enjoy the same fast and responsive performance.For example, the iPhone SE delivered silky smooth gameplay while I sped along in Sayonara Wild Hearts and tried to stay on the track in Super Impossible Road. The graphics were not as crisp due to the iPhone SE’s lower-res display, but the overall action was just as swift and enjoyable. Loading apps and switching between apps was also lag-free.Scrolling on the iPhone SE feels slower than on phones with a 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate, but I don’t expect that perk on a sub-$400 phone.On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the iPhone SE scored 3,226 on the multi-core test and 1,337 on the single-core portion. Those numbers are comparable to what the iPhone 11 (3,251 and 1,331) turned in. They also beat the Galaxy S20, which scored 3,147 and 867 and costs $600 more.The iPhone SE performed very well on real-world performance tests, too. It took the phone just 43 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p after applying a few edits in the Adobe Premiere Rush app. That result actually beats the pricier Samsung Galaxy S20, which took 1 minute and 15 seconds.Since our testing iPhone SE review, Apple has released the iPhone 12 family, with four models powered by the faster A14 Bionic chip. Those phones outperform the iPhone SE, but make no mistake — the A13 inside Apple's cheapest iPhone still delivers a punch that tops many other devices.The iPhone SE is rated for less battery life than the the iPhone 11, so you shouldn't expect the longest endurance. For instance, Apple says that the iPhone SE delivers 13 hours of video playback, versus 17 hours for the iPhone 11.On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE, the iPhone SE 2020 averaged 9 hours and 18 minutes. That's well below the endurance of the iPhone 11 (11:16), iPhone 11 Pro (10:24) and iPhone 11 Pro Max (11:54). The iPhone SE did, however, best the Pixel 4a, which scored a mere 8:55.In my anecdotal testing, I found that the iPhone SE does have less staying power than my iPhone 11 Pro Max, as it has a smaller battery. For example, after unplugging the iPhone SE at 7 am and using it for web surfing, playing games, taking photos and more throughout the day, I had 20% juice left at 8 pm. That's not bad, but my iPhone 11 Pro Max still had close to 40% power.Unfortunately, the iPhone SE comes with Apple’s standard 5-watt Lightning charger. (The bright side? Apple stopped including chargers with last fall's iPhone 12 releases.) And with that you can expect to get to just 29% power in 30 minutes, based on our testing. If you want to be able to juice this phone to 50% in 30 minutes, you’re going to have to pay extra for an 18W charger from Apple. It’s $29 for the power brick and another $19 for the USB C to Lightning cable.If you want to go wireless, the iPhone SE supports 7.5W wireless charging and supports the Qi standard. Check out all the best wireless chargers to pair with this phone.Released after the iPhone SE, the Google Pixel 4a is a very good alternative to Apple's phone. At $349, it costs $50 less than the iPhone SE. And for that price you get a bigger 5.8-inch OLED display, much slimmer bezels and a Night mode for the camera, which the iPhone SE lacks. The Pixel 4a also offers double the storage at 128GB vs 64GB for the iPhone.On the other hand, the Snapdragon 730 processor inside the Pixel 4a is slower than Apple's A13 Bionic chip. Plus, the iPhone SE has a water resistant design, as well as wireless charging. So it really comes down to whether you prefer iOS or Android.The iPhone SE 2020 is the affordable iPhone to beat, and the one of the best cheap phones you can get. It’s the closest thing to future-proof you’ll find under $400, offering the fastest performance around, very good cameras, wireless charging and a premium design that outclasses cheap Android phones.Yes, I wish the bezels were smaller and that Apple included Night mode for the camera — and you don’t get 5G connectivity — but overall it’s hard to complain too much at this price. A 5G-capable iPhone SE 3 could be on the horizon, but it likely won't arrive until 2022. The iPhone XR is a tempting alternative to the iPhone SE as it now costs just $499. For that money you bet a bigger display and bigger battery but a slower CPU and less advanced cameras. If you prefer a smaller phone, however, this handset will not disappoint. Overall, the iPhone SE is the one of the best phones for those on a budget.Reasons to buy the iPhone SE 2020Reasons to skip the iPhone SE 2020"
27,iPhone 11 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro,"Apple may have since moved ahead with the iPhone 12 Pro, but the iPhone 11 Pro continues to provide big performance in a compact package. You get triple rear cameras offer amazing performance, complete with an ultra-wide lens, a new Night mode and better Smart HDR, plus extended dynamic range in video. Why more recent iPhones rank among the best camera phones around, the iPhone 11 Pro remains one of the best unlocked iPhones, if you can find it for a discounted price.Other highlights include a very bright 5.8-inch display that's easy to use with one hand, a fast A13 Bionic processor that smokes the Android competition that came out at the same time and a fast charger in the box (finally) — something you won't get with any iPhone 12 model. Apple wins both our iPhone 11 Pro vs Galaxy S10 face-off and a more recent Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus vs. iPhone 11 Pro comparison. Read on for our full iPhone 11 Pro review.Editor's note: Apple has discontinued the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max (as well as the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max); if you're looking for Apple's newest big phones, check out our iPhone 13 Pro review and our iPhone 13 Pro Max review.The iPhone 11 Pro debuted at $999 in 2019 for a relatively skimpy 64GB of storage. It's no longer part of Apple's iPhone lineup, though you can still find the iPhone 11 Pro at carriers and retail sites. Just make sure the price is less than the $999 you'd pay for a newer iPhone 12 Pro.By comparison, the Galaxy Note 10 packs four times as much storage at 256GB, though Apple does a better job with compression than Android phones. You can pay $1,149 for 256GB of storage on the iPhone 11 Pro or $1,349 for 512GB. If you’re a U.K. user, the iPhone 11 Pro used to cost £1,049 for the 64GB storage version, then £1,119 for 128GB and £1,399 for 256GB. Be sure to check out our iPhones 11 deals page to make sure you take advantage of any discounts on Apple's older iPhones.One look at the back of the iPhone 11 Pro and you know this phone means business. The three large camera lenses dominate the top left corner, and they're a bit intimidating at first. And while the iPhone 11 has friendly colors like green, purple and yellow, the iPhone 11 Pro sticks to conservative hues like midnight green, space gray, gold and silver.I really like the matte finish on the back; it not only resists fingerprints (I'm looking at you, Galaxy Note 10) but it's less slippery than other glass phones. The iPhone 11 Pro has no trouble shrugging off water. I dumped it in a fountain and the phone didn't experience any issues. The device is IP68 rated and can withstand being submerged in up to 4 meters for up to 30 minutes. (That's a full 2 meters more than the iPhone 11 can withstand.)There's a couple of things that I don't love about the iPhone 11 Pro's design. The first is that it's a bit heavier than the iPhone XS (6.63 ounces versus 6.24 ounces), and it's also slightly wider and thicker, which I suspect has to do with additions like the third camera and perhaps a larger battery. Nevertheless, it is still compact enough to top our list of the best small phones.The second nitpick is that the iPhone 11 Pro looks nearly identical to recent iPhones from the front. Yes, the notch has become iconic at this point, but I'd like to see something closer to a full-screen iPhone.Apple says the iPhone 11 Pro has the ""toughest glass ever"" in a smartphone. And we put that claim to the test by conducting an iPhone 11 Pro drop test from different heights onto a sidewalk. The results were not great.At a height of about 3.5 feet, the iPhone 11 Pro's front cracked when we dropped the handset on its face. Interestingly, the back of the phone didn't suffer any damage when we dropped it from the same height, but the rear did crack from a shoulder-height drop. Regardless, we would invest in an iPhone 11 Pro case.Some iPhone 11 Pro owners have complained that their screens have scratched easily. However, we have not encountered any issues with our review unit. If you are concerned about your phone picking up scuffs or scratches we'd suggest investing in a screen protector.It's one thing to measure the brightness of the iPhone 11 Pro's 5.8-inch Super Retina XDR display in our labs. And it impressed the lab with an average reading of 752 nits. That far outshines the Galaxy Note 10 (674 nits) and last year's iPhone XS (611 nits).But you especially notice the difference when you put the iPhone 11 Pro next to the Galaxy Note 10 outside. Even without a lot of sunlight, the iPhone 11 Pro's screen made the Note 10's panel look downright dim. I had to double-check that Samsung's phone was on max brightness.Overall, the OLED panel on the iPhone 11 Pro is pretty stunning, thanks to its wide color support and ultrawide viewing angles. In the trailer for See coming to Apple TV+, the sweeping landscapes and minute details in people's faces really drew me into the action, though I’d personally prefer the larger 6.5-inch canvas on the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The sound through the iPhone 11 Pro is just as compelling, thanks to support for spatial audio and Dolby Atmos. When watching the See trailer, it felt like the driving rain on Jason Momoa's head was happening around me instead of just in front of me.With three lenses comprising the rear camera, backed by a wealth of computational photography smarts, the iPhone 11 Pro's new imaging stack is phenomenally ambitious, even by Cupertino's imaging standards.It starts with a trio of 12-megapixel sensors, each tied to a different type of lens to offer a unique perspective on your surroundings. Like with the iPhone XS and iPhone X before it, there's a secondary telephoto shooter that offers 2x optical zoom, although Apple has widened the aperture to ƒ/2.0, up from ƒ/2.4 in last year's flagship to let in more light. Meanwhile, the new ultrawide camera delivers a 120-degree field of view, akin to a 0.5x zoom. But it's not all about hardware. Apple’s new Night Mode finally enables the latest batch of iPhones to contend with Google and Huawei's benchmark low-light camera performance.That's immediately clear from this striking shot of an outdoor bar, captured using the iPhone 11 Pro’s Night Mode. With an older iPhone in hand, you'd could never attain a shot this crisp and balanced in the highlights and shadows, at this time of the evening. Apple's low-light smarts plainly best Google's in this comparison, as the Pixel 3 has no answer for the detail present in the concrete slab, or in the patina of the wooden fence, as they were captured with the iPhone's primary lens.I also love the darker, more realistic tone of the sky in the iPhone's example, and how Apple's hardware and software correct for the distortion that plagues the perimeter of the Pixel's attempt.Google's newer Pixel 4 offers even better cameras, and you should check our iPhone 11 Pro vs Pixel 4 camera shootout to see how they stack up. Spoiler alert: Apple wins. The iPhone 11 Pro's impressive performance in dim conditions proved to be a theme for the rest of the night. Inside a club, Apple's handset again paints a sharper, more lifelike view of a complex scene, mixing lighting of various colors with lots of intricate textures.Compared with the image the Pixel 3 delivered, you can actually pick out the individual drivers shrouded behind the mesh of the speaker to the right of the room. And where Google's software dulls the spotlights considerably, Apple's seems more willing to allow those to shine brightly in certain places, which handily boosts the contrast and depth of the overall result.The iPhone 11 Pro's camera is so stunning in the dark, that if you own one, your friends will assuredly designate you as the group's official photographer. They'll insist you take every shot — although, as we discovered, the iPhone 11 Pro's low-light capabilities have one weakness: portraits.The new telephoto lens captures stunning shallow depth-of-field shots in the daytime, though it strangely produces portraits that are simultaneously noisy and blurry when lighting isn't ideal. And while I prefer the iPhone's warmer cast — it more naturally fits the true conditions of the venue — the Pixel 3's take is so much clearer, that almost doesn't matter. There's no reason the iPhone 11 Pro shouldn't be able to punch up dim portraits the same way it does typical night shots, so hopefully this can be corrected in a software update.The iPhone 11 Pro's ultrawide lens similarly struggled to top the one on the back of Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 Plus inside New York City's iconic Grand Central Station. Every detail is a bit duller through the new iPhone's camera. Whether it's the shadows cutting across the pillars, or the separation between the bricks in the walls, or the carvings adorning the ceiling, Samsung's optics rendered it with more sharpness.On the flip side, I much prefer the way Apple's ultrawide camera painted the view from the southwest corner of Bryant Park. Excluding the difference in sunlight in the background, the grass, fallen leaves and lettering on the signage in the foreground are just more discernible on the iPhone. I also love the way the camera's HDR processing brought out all the grays and whites lurking within the clouds in the sky. The contrast adds a richness and gravity to the scene that Samsung's phablet misses out on.For this delectable close-up on a cookie, we used the primary lens on both the iPhone and Note. Even though Samsung's device packs an AI-aided Scene Optimizer that can recognize food and adjust exposure, contrast and saturation accordingly, it was Apple's handset that brought home the unmistakably more delicious shot. All the cookie's nooks and crannies are so much richer, both in color and depth, looking at the iPhone 11 Pro's result. The Galaxy somehow glosses over those intricacies.Finally, we put the iPhone 11 Pro's new 12-MP front-facing camera to the test with an ultrawide selfie that seemed fuller of color and texture compared with the Note's best work. Samsung's software dials up the skin smoothing and opts for flatter, less saturated hues, which makes the photo look as if it were captured on a cloudy day, even though it wasn't. The improvement from the iPhone XS' 7-MP selfies is clear to see for users coming from that device, and I love how Apple has made it so easy to widen the field of view when shooting with the front-facing camera. You don't even need to tap anything — all you have to do is turn the phone from portrait to landscape orientation.The iPhone 11 Pro's camera is so stunning in the dark, that if you own one, your friends will assuredly designate you as the group's official photographer.In fact, the only thing I find more impressive than the iPhone 11 Pro's photography is how easy Apple has made it to use the camera app. This is a phenomenally advanced mobile imaging system, and yet it's not anywhere near as complicated to get the most out of, in practice, compared with the best camera phones from the likes of Huawei and Samsung.For example, Night Mode is triggered automatically based on shooting conditions, but the phone still tells you how long the exposure will have to be before you even press the shutter button. A countdown commences as Night Mode shots are captured, which means you're not holding still indefinitely while you wonder how much time the camera needs to work its magic. Additionally, the new viewfinder experience, which shows other zoom perspectives in the overflow area behind the controls to give you a sense of what a wider vantage point can offer, is another brilliant idea. All mobile camera interfaces should be this straightforward.The iPhone 11 Pro's photography gets even better with Apple's new Deep Fusion mode, which is part of the iOS 13.2 upgrade. Deep Fusion is sort of like traditional HDR, in that it comprises a wealth of differently-exposed frames. However, it goes a step further by analyzing each one at the pixel level.Apple says the technology delivers unparalleled sharpness by incorporating elements of every photo for an optimized, ideal shot. And we did see a difference when we used Deep Fusion on the iPhone Pro versus the regular camera mode on the iPhone 11 Pro Max.If you take a look at my colleague Rami in this portrait, you can make out his facial hair more clearly with Deep Fusion on, and there's more texture when you compare the inside of his hoodie across both images. There's not a huge difference, but it's noticeable.Apple has lavished unprecedented attention on the iPhone 11 Pro's video capabilities. Unlike most similarly priced flagships that can deliver only the highest frame rates and resolutions from a phone's primary camera, the Pro devices can capture 4K-resolution video at 60 frames per second from any one of their its rear lenses. What's more, even while you're shooting with one camera, your iPhone is priming the exposure levels and white balance of the other two sensors in the background, so that the transition from perspective to perspective is seamless.The result is, quite simply, the finest video-recording experience I've ever enjoyed on a phone. Watching our sample video depicting a stroll through Bryant Park, the iPhone 11 Pro handles on-the-fly changes in lighting, lens switching and stabilization so much better than the quadruple-lens Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The difference in zooming in and out is especially jarring; on the iPhone, the transition is fast yet smooth, whereas the Note's is jerky and instantaneous. Additionally, Samsung's phablet clearly sustains a few hiccups at the outset of the video, dropping a handful of frames somewhat embarrassingly mere moments after I begin rolling.The result is, quite simply, the finest video-recording experience I've ever enjoyed on a phone.This iPhone is also the first capable of shooting slow-motion video at 120 fps through the front-facing camera. You might wonder why someone might use such a feature, but Apple has prepared an answer for that: Slofies. All iPhone 11 models make it possible to document super-slow footage of your hair blowing in the wind or a pie to the face.The results certainly maintain parity with the high-quality video you can get using the back cameras, though we'll have to wait to find out whether the slofie becomes ubiquitous, or fizzles out like a passing fad, in much the same way Animojis did.In less surprising news, Apple once again has the world's fastest phone, thanks to the iPhone 11 Pro’s A13 Bionic chip. This processor offers 20% faster CPU, GPU and machine-learning performance, and it shows in benchmark testing and real-world tests.On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the iPhone 11 Pro scored 1,337 on the single-core portion of the test and 3,509 on the multicore test. The Galaxy Note 10 mustered 746 and 2,640 on the same tests, while the OnePlus 7 Pro also trailed the iPhone 11 Pro at 744 and 2,802.The iPhone 11 Pro also dominated on the GFXBench graphics test. This handset scored 2,174 frames, or 33.8 fps, on the Aztec Ruins (High Tier) off-screen benchmark, compared with 1,058/16 fps for the Note 10.Apple's phone impressed again on the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme test, another graphics benchmark. The iPhone 11 Pro notched 6,163, while the Note 10 (5,374) and the OnePlus 7 Pro (5,581) fell behind.On our real-world performance test, the iPhone 11 Pro shined once more, but it wasn't any faster than its predecessor this time around. It took the phone 46 seconds to export a 4K video to 1080p after applying a color filter and transition. The Galaxy Note 10 Plus took 1:34. Because it's a smaller phone, I didn't expect the iPhone 11 Pro to outlast the iPhone 11 or the iPhone 11 Pro Max, but it performed well given its size. The phone lasted an average of 10 hours and 24 minutes on the Tom's Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE on 150 nits of screen brightness.By comparison, the iPhone 11 lasted an average of 11:16 on our test, with the iPhone 11 Pro Max enduring for a whopping 11:54.In the iPhone 11 Pro vs. Samsung's S10 face-off, the Galaxy S10's runtime of 10:19 is similar to the iPhone 11, but the Galaxy S10 Plus lasted a much longer 12:35. Interestingly, the Galaxy Note 10 endured for just 9:25, while the Note 10 Plus hit 11:09 on average. The OnePlus 7 Pro eked out only 9:31.I’m glad that Apple has finally bundled a fast charger with an iPhone. The iPhone 11 Pro ships with an 18-watt charger that got to 55% juice in only 30 minutes. That's great, and outpaces the Note 10's 25-watt charger (47% in 30 minutes). However, the OnePlus 7 Pro hit 60% with its 40-watt charger in the same time frame. The short answer to the above question is not really — at least at this moment. The fact that the iPhone 11 Pro lacks 5G is disappointing in the sense that you're probably going to hold onto this phone for the next few years. By then 5G should be everywhere, but right now the 5G networks are still being built out, and the speeds they're offering aren't appreciably better than what the latest LTE infrastructure offers.So you’ll have to settle for 4G LTE on this phone, and the iPhone 11 Pro supports 4x4 MIMO, giving you two more antennas than the regular iPhone 11. The iPhone 11 Pro also comes with Wi-Fi 6 built in, which means you should enjoy more efficient throughput if you buy a Wi-Fi 6 router.One wireless surprise is Apple's proprietary U1 chip, which uses Ultra Wideband to accurately locate other nearby devices with the same chip inside. For example, you can share files over AirDrop with other iPhone 11 or iPhone 11 Pro owners by pointing your phone in their direction, and the transfers will be handled more efficiently than before. But I’m guessing that more exciting applications are on the way, such as the rumored object tracker from Apple that would take on devices like the Tile.Apple's iOS 13 came preloaded on the iPhone 11 Pro, and it brought some welcome improvements. I especially appreciated Sign in with Apple, which made it easier to sign in with all sorts of apps without having to futz with passwords — or worry as much about my privacy.But right out of the gate I really appreciate the new Photos app. The Days, Months and Years views help your pics come alive, and I like the way Apple mixes in videos with still photos. While I'm not giving up Google Maps anytime soon (Apple burned that bridge for me and then gave me incorrect directions back to the bridge), I'm glad that there's a new Maps app that's been rebuilt from the ground up with high-res 3D photos. There's also a Look Around feature that's similar to Google's Street View.It's a small thing, but I like the redesigned Reminders app, as there are more in-your-face counters to see at a glance how many items on a to-do list you still need to complete. Of course, since this review initially posted, Apple released iOS 14, which brought even more features to all iPhones, including the iPhone 11 Pro. (Our iOS 14.5 review has the latest assessment of those capabilities.) And this fall, the iPhone 11 Pro will support iOS 15.The iPhone 11 Pro continues to be one of the last great small phones in existence. And that's no small feat when you consider all of the great stuff Apple packed into this phone. You get arguably the best cameras in a phone along with class-leading performance and an OLED display that outshines most Android phones. My only reservations with the iPhone 11 Pro are its measly 64GB of included storage and that its battery life, while good, trails both the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max.If it were my dough, I would spend the extra $100 on the iPhone 11 Pro Max for its bigger screen and extra endurance. (Or I'd buy a new iPhone like the iPhone 12 Pro, which has a 6.1-inch display.) But the regular iPhone 11 is still very much worth the investment for those who desire killer cameras in a more compact package."
28,iPhone 11,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-11,"Thanks to its reduced price, the iPhone 11 remains one of the best phones for the money. Now at $499 following the iPhone 13 launch, the new iPhone costs $200 less than the iPhone 13 mini and $300 less than the iPhone 13. Yet, if you don't mind the two-year-old hardware, the iPhone still provides pretty much everything you need in a smartphone. The cameras are very good, thanks to an ultra-wide lens and a Night mode for better low-light performance.As you'll see in our full iPhone 11 review, Apple upped the ante with greater video-recording quality while also delivering superb battery life. At $799, the iPhone 12 is a great option with its 5G support and an even faster A14. But if you’re on a budget, the iPhone 11 is the best phone for you, and it's one of the best unlocked iPhones if you don't want to commit to a carrier.Editor's note: If you're having trouble deciding which phone to buy, check out our comparison of the iPhone 13 vs. the iPhone 11, as well as our iPhone 13 review. The iPhone 11 went on sale Sept. 20, 2019 at a starting price of $699 for 64GB of storage, or $29.12 per month. That was $50 less than the iPhone XR's debut price. Apple has since cut the price the iPhone 11 and dropped the iPhone XR from its lineup now that we're living in an iPhone 13 world. You can get an iPhone 11 for $499 these days, and if you trade in an iPhone at Apple, you can lower the cost even further.The new iPhones boost starting storage to 128GB, but the iPhone 11 is a relic of the days when Apple thought 64GB of storage was good enough. You can upgrade to the 128GB iPhone 11 model for $50 extra.For the UK, you can buy the iPhone 11 from Apple’s website, where it debuted at £729, £779, £879 for the 64GB, 128GB and 256GB storage versions respectively. In comparison, this was about £20 less than the entry level iPhone XR’s launch price, which is unarguably a discount, but a paltry one. These days, UK shoppers pay £489 for the iPhone 11.Check out our iPhone 11 deals page for the latest sales and discounts.The iPhone 11's design is a mix of familiar and fresh. The front and sides are pretty much samesies with the iPhone XR, complete with the notch at the top, aluminum band and somewhat chunky bezels (at least compared to the iPhone 11 Pro and the best Android phones).The telltale sign that you have the new iPhone is the oversized dual cameras on the back, housed in a matte glass square. The lenses kind of remind me of robot eyes. The rest of the glass has a glossy finish, so this camera patch provides an interesting bit of contrast. (The iPhone 11 Pro is all matte glass on the back.)I like the colors for the iPhone 11, which have a more restrained vibe than the Technicolor rainbow that made up the iPhone XR lineup. The more muted hues include a mint green, a pale yellow and a light lavender purple. You can also pick from back, white and Product Red.The biggest design change on the iPhone 11 is what you don't see. Apple claims that this phone has the toughest glass — front and back — of any smartphone, thanks to a dual-ion exchange process. Some iPhone 11 owners have complained about easily scratched displays, although we have not noticed any scratches on our review unit. Still, you may want to invest in an iPhone 11 screen protector or iPhone 11 case.This device also has IP68-rated water resistance, which means that it can withstand 2 meters of water for 30 minutes, and is one of the best waterproof phones out there. The iPhone XR could do only 1 meter. The iPhone 11 Pro ups that to 4 meters, but that's hardly a reason to spend extra dough.At 5.94 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches and 6.84 ounces, the iPhone 11 is identical to the iPhone XR in size and weight. This puts the phone in between the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro and the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max, which I find to be a happy medium in terms of immersive viewing and being able to use the phone with one hand.The iPhone 11's Liquid Retina HD display is still 6.1 inches like the iPhone XR with the same 1792 x 828 resolution. And our opinion of this panel remains unchanged. It's fantastic for an LCD, with vibrant colors and excellent brightness, but it's not OLED-great.When watching a scene from Stranger Things, both the iPhone 11's LCD and iPhone 11 Pro OLED screen delivered rich colors and fine detail but the viewing angles were narrower on the iPhone 11. The Pro's OLED panel also delivered blacker blacks, which makes for better contrast.In our lab tests, the new iPhone turned in solid results. The display registered 652 nits of brightness, which is better than the iPhone XR's 589 nits. This panel also registered 113% of the sRGB color gamut. That pales in comparison to some phones with OLED displays; for example, the Galaxy S10 got 208.2%, the OnePlus 7 Pro 180%. It's important to note, though, that Apple purposely tunes its displays to not offer oversaturated hues.And this is also one accurate screen. The iPhone 11's LCD turned in a Delta-E rating of 0.22 (0 is perfect). The Galaxy S10 was slightly worse with 0.38.When it comes to sound, the iPhone 11's new spatial audio provides a wider soundstage, complete with Dolby Atmos support. And for a moment I thought I was in a movie theater as I watched the Trailer for John Wick 3. I could clearly hear glass breaking to the left and right of me as it smashed on screen, and every gunshot echoed through my brain (for better or worse).The new iPhone also provided more robust audio as I listened to Weezer's ""Take On Me"" side by side with the Galaxy Note 10. Samsung's handset sounded tinnier by comparison.Apple's iPhone cameras have recently taken a back seat to the likes of the Google Pixel 3, Huawei P30 Pro and Galaxy S10. The iPhone XR literally couldn't hold a candle to the Pixel 3 in low light in our camera face-off. What a difference the iPhone 11 makes.Take a look at this image of a flower and vase shot indoors in near darkness. The image from last year's iPhone XS is a dim blob of petals, while you can make out the individual petals and colors in the new iPhone's shot (even though there is noticeable noise).Thanks to a new wide camera sensor with 100 percent Focus Pixels and smarter software, the iPhone 11 does a much better job snapping pics in little to no light. And the Night Mode kicks in automatically, so you don't have to swipe or tap to activate it as you do with the Android competition. With the iPhone 11, you just have the hold the phone steady for up to 3 seconds as you shoot.We didn't need Night mode on the iPhone 11 or Pixel 3 for this shot taken inside a dim bar, but it still proved to be a good challenge for both phones. The iPhone 11 triumphed in this case, as it delivered a brighter overall image, especially in the overhead lights. You can also make out more detail in the woman's hair in the iPhone 11's photo, and the Pixel 3 has more trouble with the light shining behind the bottles in the upper left corner.The other big improvement comes from the iPhone 11's new 12-MP ultra-wide camera, which joins the standard 12-MP camera. This feature lets you fit in up to four times more scene without having to back up, thanks to a 120-degree field of view. In a clever move, the redesigned camera interface gives you a sneak preview of what you could squeeze into the frame if you engaged the ultra-wide lens.In this photo taken in Bryant Park on an overcast day with the iPhone 11 and Galaxy Note 10, the Note 10 delivers a brighter shot overall. The grass is definitely a more vibrant green. There are other aspects that make the iPhone 11's ulta-wide shot look better, including sharper details and less distortion toward the edges of the frame, but in this case I prefer the Note's pic.Apple also takes Smart HDR to the next level in the iPhone 11, as the machine learning can understand what the subject is and keep the details you want in the face while retaining the shadows.In this portrait of my colleague Shaun, his face looks warmer and you can make out the finer lines in his forehead more easily. The Note 10's shot looks washed out. However, the iPhone 11's image accidentally cut off a piece of Shaun's head on the right side.My only gripe with the iPhone 11 and taking portraits is that it puts you farther away from your subject than the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro do, because the regular iPhone 11 lacks a telephoto lens. So, you'll either have to walk up to your subject or just accept having more of the background in the frame.The one photo that won me over with the new iPhone's camera versus the Note 10's is this cookie. The iPhone 11's photo captures practically every nook and cranny and the M&Ms really pop, while the Galaxy Note 10's pic looks somewhat washed out and overly bright.I'm not including many comparisons here versus Google's Pixel 3 because the Pixel 4 is on the way, but I thought this flower shot taken with 2x digital zoom with both phones was interesting. The iPhone 11's shot delivers more realistic colors given the lighting conditions. Still, some may prefer the Pixel 3 photo because of the darker lavender petals and slightly sharper detail.With iOS 13, the iPhone 11 offered a Deep Fusion feature to perform pixel-by-pixel photo processing to deliver even more detail and better textures along with less noise. Again, you don't need to activate a separate mode; it will just kick in when you're indoors and there's a decent amount of light.We put Deep Fusion to the test using the iPhone 11 Pro with a beta version of iOS 13.2 and found that there was a subtle improvement. (Deep Fusion works the same on the regular iPhone 11.) Take the above portrait of my colleague, Henry; you can make out more detail in his eyebrows and hair, but his sweater looks pretty much the same across both shots. More and more smartphone makers are upping their video game, and Apple has come out swinging with 4K support for both of its cameras at 60 fps. Apple designed the iPhone 11's cameras to offer extended dynamic range to achieve better highlight details and smoother motion via cinematic stabilization.What Apple set out to do was give videographers the ability to shoot the same quality video using either lens while maintaining the color and exposure even as you walk through trick lighting situations.To put the phone's video capabilities to the test, I walked on a gravel path on a park trail, and found that there's really no contest between the new iPhone and Galaxy Note 10. Although Samsung's cameras produced more vibrant greens, the colors were not realistic, and you get more gradation of color and contrast in the iPhone 11's footage. You can also make out more detail in the surrounding grass and leaves in the iPhone 11's video. The Note 10 also had a bit more difficulty with lens flare.To make shooting video feel more integrated with taking photos, Apple redesigned the iOS 13 camera interface so that you can easily capture QuickTake videos. You just hold the shutter button to start shooting video. You then slide your finger to the right to continue shooting that clip. Don't worry, if you press the shutter and then slide to the left you can still do burst captures of still images.You could say that the iPhone XR's 7-MP front camera was selfie challenged, but the iPhone 11 rectifies that with a sharper 12-MP sensor with a wider field of view. With a tap you can engage the wider angle or you can simply rotate the phone to landscape mode and the wide view will turn on automatically, which is a smart implementation.But the one front camera feature everyone is talking about with the new iPhone is ""slofies,"" which are slo-mo selfie videos shot at 120 fps. I don't know if the name will take off, but it's a fun feature for those who want to add some drama to selfies.For kicks, I took a slofie while trying to make a basket in the driveway behind my head. Apple makes it easy in the editing software to slow down just the bits you want. I won't tell you how many takes it took to make the basket, but I like the detail in the shot, especially in the clouds behind me.For regular selfie videos, you can shoot in 4K up to 60 fps, though if you want the same extended dynamic range offered by the iPhone 11's rear cameras you'll have to stick with 30 fps.Apple already had the fastest CPU in a phone at the time of the iPhone 11's release, and that phone's A13 Bionic processor extended the company's lead. (The A14 Bionic in the current iPhone 12 lineup is even faster.) Apple claims that the A13 chip offers 20 percent faster performance across the board over its predecessor, including CPU, graphics and machine learning.The game Grimvalor played silky smooth on the new iPhone as I hacked, slashed and double jumped my way through this side-scrolling platformer. I didn't notice any hiccups even with multiple enemies on screen. I also enjoyed playing Angry Birds AR; I could get up real close to the pigs before I flung my sling shot and didn't notice any stuttering as I walked around the level.On Geekbench 5, a benchmark that measures overall performance, the iPhone 11 notched a single-core mark of 1,333 and a multicore score of 3,251, compared with 736 and 2,691, respectively, for the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The OnePlus 7 Pro hit 744 and 2,802 on the same test.When it comes to graphics performance, the iPhone 11 fell behind top Android phones on the 3DMark benchmark app. On the Slingshot Extreme Metal portion of the test, the iPhone 11 scored 5,785 on the Slingshot Extreme Unlimited Test. By comparison, the Note 10 scored 6,295 on and the OnePlus 7 6,375.We also ran GFX Bench, which is another graphics benchmark, and this time the iPhone 11 crushed it. On the Aztech Ruins High Tier offscreen test, the iPhone 11 hit 1481 frames (23 fps), compared with 1,058 frames (16 fps) for the Galaxy Note 10. On the Normal Tier version of the same test, the iPhone 11 hit 4,366/67.9 fps versus the Galaxy Note 10’s 1,486/23 fps.To test real-world performance, we used the Adobe Rush app to edit a 4K video and then transcoded it to 1080p. The iPhone 11 took just 45 seconds, which is surprisingly just about as fast as last year's iPhone XR result. However, this time still smokes the Android competition, as the Note 10 Plus took 1:34.The iPhone 11 offers very good endurance. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G at 150 nits of screen brightness, the iPhone 11's battery lasted an average of 11 hours and 16 minutes. You can see how the iPhone lineup fared overall in our iPhone 11 battery life guide.By comparison, the Galaxy S10 hit 10:35 and the Galaxy S10 Plus lasted 12:35. The OnePlus 7 Pro was much further behind with just 9:31. The iPhone 11 Pro Max lasted a bit longer than the iPhone 11 with an average time of 11:54, but the smaller iPhone 11 Pro lasted an average of 10:24.Unfortunately, while you can fast charge the iPhone 11, you don't get a fast charger in the box like you now do with the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Those higher-end phones come with an 18-watt charger. So if you want to juice up to 50% in about 30 minutes, you’ll have to pay $25 for a 18-watt charger plus another $19 for a USB-C to Lightning cable. Boo.Apple is skipping 5G networking altogether for the iPhone 11, which is a bummer because you'll miss out on the blazing speeds offered by phones like the Galaxy S10 5G, which can go as high as a gigabit per second. 5G networks are still being built out, and the modems that support multiple 5G bands are just now hitting the market. Still, if you want a true future-proof iPhone, you may want to wait for the iPhone 12.The iPhone 11 supports 4G LTE, which offers decent performance but not the same speeds as the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. Why? Because while the new iPhone has 2x 2 MIMO antennas, the iPhone 11 Pro models offer 4x4 MIMO for better performance.On the Speedtest.net app, the iPhone 11 delivered an average download speed of 13 Mbps over T-Mobile's network in the same location in New Jersey, compared with 15 Mbps for the iPhone 11 Pro Max. Uploads speeds were a similar story, with the iPhone 11 averaging 5.4 Mbps to the iPhone 11 Pro Max's 6.1 Mbps. That's not much of a speed difference.One unique wireless feature on the iPhone 11 is a new U1 chip for spatial awareness that uses Ultra Wideband technology. With this chip, the iPhone can accurately pinpoint the location of other U1-enabled devices; for now, that just means other iPhone 11 handsets, and the U1 chip initially benefits just AirDrop at this point. Point in the direction of another iPhone 11, you can then share the files more efficiently than you could before.Rumor has it that Apple has an AirTags object tracker in the works to better take advantage of the U1 chip. This would directly challenge the best key finders made by Tile and others.If you're on the fence about which iPhone to buy, these are some notable differences between Apple's different models. The biggest? The  iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro cost more than the iPhone 11, even with those models available for less where they're still on sale. (Neither Pro model is featured at Apple any more.) And for that premium, you get a third rear camera for telephoto zoom, higher quality OLED displays, a fast charger in the box, slightly better water resistance and zippier LTE.Is all of that worth the premium? It is for me, but I doubt it will be for most. Check out our iPhone 11 vs. iPhone 11 Pro vs. 11 Pro Max face-off for more more info.The iPhone 12 packs even better cameras, an OLED display and 5G speeds and remains on sale at a reduced cost. The iPhone 13 specs are even more impressive. But the iPhone 11 remains a good phone for those looking to spend less. With the iPhone 11, you still get a bright and colorful screen, good performance, excellent image quality and long battery life. The only strikes against the iPhone 11 other than the newer phones in Apple's lineup are its skimpy 64GB of storage in the base model and that the fast charger costs extra."
29,iPhone 12 mini,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-12-mini,"“How did they make it that small!?”That’s invariably the reaction of friends and family when I show them the iPhone 12 mini. They can’t process how tiny this 5.4-inch device is; they didn’t know smartphones could be this small anymore.Truthfully, I didn’t either. Small phone lover though I am, I have grown accustomed to the gargantuan size of modern flagships; an age where my 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro constitutes a “compact” handset, and devices like the 6.7-inch Galaxy S20 Plus that barely fit in your pocket are inexplicably the norm. The iPhone 12 mini feels like it was made for me.My favorite thing about the iPhone 12 mini, though, isn’t merely its diminutive frame; it’s the fact that this is essentially, pound-for-pound, the very same device as the 6.1-inch iPhone 12 I’ve already reviewed. You expect corners to be cut in downsized premium smartphones, yet the iPhone 12 mini never makes them. As you’ll see in our iPhone 12 mini review, aside from unavoidable sacrifices to battery life, this is still every bit the iPhone you want, at an even cheaper price now that Apple has dropped the price to accommodate the new iPhone 13 mini. (Yes, Apple made another one as part of the iPhone 13 release.) The iPhone 12 mini also happens to be a device that lovers of the best small phones and best unlocked iPhones are certain to adore. But be sure to check out our iPhone 13 mini review to see if Apple's newer small phone is right for you.Price: $729 unlocked; $699 on contract OS: iOS 14 Display: 5.4-inch OLED (2340x1080) CPU: A14 Bionic Storage: 64GB, 128GB, 256GB Rear camera: 12MP wide (ƒ/1.6), 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 12MP (ƒ/2.2) Size: 5.18 x 2.53 x 0.29 in Weight: 4.76 ozThe iPhone 12 mini debuted a little less than a year ago at $699 on contract, from carriers like Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and many others. Off contract, you’d pay $729. At that price, you’ll get 64GB of storage, though there are 128GB and 256GB versions available.These days, Apple sells the iPhone 12 mini for $599 ($629 if you buy the phone unlocked) to make way for the iPhone 13 mini which inherits that old $699 starting price. The newer mini does offer 128GB of storage in its base model.Buy your iPhone 12 mini from Apple, and you can lower the price by trading in your current iPhone — an iPhone 8 will net you up to $110 off the iPhone 12 mini, for example, with newer models earning a larger rebate. That's one of the many best iPhone 12 deals we're tracking.You won’t get a charging adapter or wired EarPods with the iPhone 12 mini, though you will get a Lightning-to-USB-C cable in the box.Like the other iPhone 12 models, the iPhone 12 mini is built to support sub-6GHz 5G and millimeter-wave 5G (mmWave) on every network. This should mean you’ll get similar 5G band support no matter what iPhone 12 you buy; whatever differences you experience in 5G service will be down to each network’s specific infrastructure and limitations.I never expected Apple to release a handset small enough to make the iPhone SE look big, but then 2020 has been all about subverting expectations.The iPhone 12 mini has a 5.4-inch display that stretches nearly from edge to edge, impeded only by a notch. Because the screen dominates the device’s surface area in the way that it does, there’s far more available real estate than what the 4.7-inch SE offers, even though the iPhone 12 mini’s footprint is nearly three-tenths of an inch shorter and a tenth narrower. That’s quite an achievement, considering modern phones’ wealth of power-guzzling componentry and need for big batteries.You almost have to relearn how to live with a device and screen this small; I found my thumbs clashing into each other more often when typing, for example. But the adjustment period isn’t daunting, and as an iPhone 11 Pro owner, I have to admit there’s a part of me that wants to swap out my iPhone for the 12 mini. It’s just so easy to hold and reach every corner of the display.Aesthetically and structurally, the iPhone 12 mini is identical to the 6.1-inch iPhone 12, only smaller. You have the same flat-edge, matte aluminum design, mostly-glossy glass back and flat display protected by Apple’s new Ceramic Shield material that promises 4x improved shatter resistance. Cupertino has also improved water resistance yet again, as every iPhone 12 is built to withstand up to about 20 feet of submersion for a maximum of 30 minutes.This is a premium-looking, premium-feeling iPhone for $700, and there’s almost nothing to complain about. Though, if I were forced to nitpick, I’d say the notch is harder to ignore on the iPhone 12 mini. It’s essentially the same size as it is on other larger models, and therefore dominates more of the mini’s tiny display. Nevertheless, the overall package is beautiful.The back of the iPhone 12 mini is where you’ll find Apple’s new MagSafe system, which can be used for wireless charging or a range of snap-on accessories, like a leather wallet attachments, sleeves, cases and so on.There’s no significant difference in the way MagSafe operates on the 12 mini relative to other iPhones, save for the fact that Apple has reduced the phone’s peak charging speed over MagSafe to 12 watts, down from 15 watts on the other models. Still, because the 12 mini’s battery is so much smaller than those in the other models, charging speeds are likely to shake out even — more on that later.Apple has closed the gap between the regular and Pro iPhone models this year by offering OLED displays on all of its devices. If you’re upgrading from an LCD-powered iPhone 8 or earlier, or perhaps the iPhone XR, the iPhone 12 mini’s screen is going to present a big leap forward.Just about everything looks richer on an OLED display. Colors are more vivid, while blacks especially are deeper and truer-to-life. Watching the trailer for The Kid Detective on YouTube, I was drawn to the pastiche of reds, yellows and oranges blanketing the trees of the bucolic autumn suburb in which the film is set.One thing missing from the iPhone 12 mini’s display repertoire, however, is a high refresh rate. The non-Pro iPhone 12 models were likely never in the running to receive 120Hz panels, but it has to be said that similarly-priced handsets from other companies — including the Google Pixel 5, the OnePlus Nord or Samsung’s Galaxy S20 FE — all offer 90Hz or 120Hz screens. The Galaxy S21 — just $100 more than the iPhone 12 mini — offers a display that dynamically adjusts its refresh rate. The iPhone 12 mini’s display is indeed very colorful and rich, however the overall experience of using the device feels less responsive all around on account of that traditional 60Hz limitation.Under our light meter, the iPhone 12 mini’s screen registered a maximum full-screen brightness of 505 nits. That’s far from the best we’ve ever seen — the regular iPhone 12 reached 569 nits, for example, while the Galaxy S20 FE topped out at 679 nits. If we were to wager a guess, the iPhone 12 mini’s peak brightness is likely curtailed a bit to eke the best possible battery life out of the device’s relatively small battery. Still, it’s easy enough to read the display outdoors on a sunny day.In terms of color reproduction, the iPhone 12 mini captured 117.8% of the sRGB color space and 83.4% of the wider DCI-P3 gamut, indicating hues that lean toward realism, but may seem a bit muted compared to what other handsets present out of the box. For example, the Galaxy S20 FE registered 133.3% in DCI-P3, which translates to far more saturation.Even the smallest iPhone 12 benefits from a dual-camera system, and not just any dual-camera system. This is the same slate of optics you get in the $100 more expensive iPhone 12: a 12-megapixel primary lens with an ƒ/1.6 aperture, paired with a 12MP ultrawide featuring an ƒ/2.4 aperture and 120-degree field of view.The main sensor is the one that’s seen the most improvement for the iPhone 12 line, with Apple’s fastest-ever ƒ/1.6 lens contributing to a quoted 27% increase in low-light performance and a new optical image stabilization system that can perform 5,000 micro-adjustments per second. That same sensor can also capture 4K HDR video at up to 60 frames per second, or 30 frames per second with Dolby Vision processing enabled.So what kind of photos can iPhone 12 mini owners expect from that new primary camera? I took Apple’s smallest flagship and the similarly-priced Pixel 5 out on a peaceful fall day to snap a pair of photos of a river, and came away impressed with the result from both for different reasons. The Pixel 5 does color in more of the river bank and hillside to the left, and the last leaves left hanging on the trees pop just a bit more. However, the iPhone 12 mini’s rendition is universally sharper. And though it’s not necessarily the focal point of the frame, the iPhone’s shot retains more color in the brick wall to the right as well.Neither the iPhone 12 mini nor the Pixel 5 has a telephoto lens with optical zoom — they both rely on processing to sharpen up digital zoom. Previously, this was an area where the iPhones have struggled, but Apple has definitely closed the gap with the iPhone 12 range, and so the biggest difference relates to color balancing and contrast here. Google’s phone still may retain a slight advantage in sharpness with its Super Res Zoom system, but the smoke stack itself is clad in considerably more darkness and everything has a bit of a red shift to it, whereas the iPhone 12 mini better picks up the specular highlights bouncing off the brick.The iPhone 12 mini has an especially wide ultrawide lens compared to the Pixel 5, pulling in more of the surroundings in this example. This does certainly lead to some distortion at the fringes, but the iPhone controls it well, and the result is an image with more color and deeper contrast than what Google’s handset has given us here. What’s especially surprising is how Apple’s imaging system is able to really hone in on details like the window panes and brick texture, achieving a crispness that the Pixel 5 can’t match, even though it packs a higher-resolution sensor on paper.Improvements to Apple’s Night mode, along with that aforementioned new wider aperture, certainly help the iPhone 12 mini rein in more light in adverse conditions. I’m impressed with how the tiny iPhone navigated this scene, which mixed extremely dark and shadowy regions with white-hot sources of light from lamps. I also prefer the warmer tone and white balance of the iPhone’s shot, compared to the Pixel’s rendition here. That said, Google’s Night Sight technology is a bit better at lighting those especially dim areas, like the roof of the building immediately ahead and the brick off in the upper left. Google’s still got a bit of an edge at night in my opinion, though Apple’s certainly done well to close the gap with this generation.To get a sense of how the iPhone 12 mini’s low-light performance fares against its predecessor’s, I snapped another pair of images of a nearly pitch-black river, this time comparing it to my iPhone 11 Pro. There isn’t much separating the two, though if you look closely, the newer iPhone dials in a bit more sharpness closest to the camera, like with the leaves in the immediate foreground and the reflection of the street lamp in the water. Throughout most of the frame, however, it’s clear to see Apple’s hasn’t transformed Night Mode with this generation — the differences are few and far between.But the iPhone 12 mini’s greatest advantage, in my opinion, is the way it navigates selfies and portraits. Compared to Google’s effort, I’d be much more willing to post Apple’s showing here to my Instagram. Not only is the iPhone’s shot generally sharper, retaining more warmth in my skin tone, but it also nails those especially minute details, like the fabric of my winter hat and the texture of the tag on the front. This is Apple’s Deep Fusion feature at work, snapping and melding multiple exposures together to dial up the fidelity on the most intricate aspects of every scene. Look closely, and you’ll also notice the iPhone does a better job of isolating my hair and cap from the background bokeh as well.The iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are the most powerful smartphones we’ve ever tested at Tom’s Guide, and the iPhone 12 mini shares their processor — the A14 Bionic. Typically, small phones are short-changed on the performance front, but the iPhone 12 mini is every bit as fast as those larger, pricier variants.It really doesn’t matter what you’re doing on the iPhone 12 mini. Whether gaming, swiping through social media or using the camera, this device never drops a bead of sweat. Asphalt 9 Legends is my graphics-pushing game of choice when I test handsets, and this little iPhone still pushes console-quality visuals at a stable framerate — a rare feat for this particular title. I was especially impressed with the smoothness of the motion blur, which really heightened the immersion of racing on this tiny display.In the system-wide Geekbench 5 multi-core test, the iPhone 12 mini totaled 4,123 points — even better than the iPhone 12’s 3,859 points, and certainly worlds apart from the Galaxy S20 FE (2,928) and Pixel 5 (1,617). The Galaxy S21, which came out months after the iPhone 12 mini and boasts a fast Snapdragon 888 system-on-chip, still falls short of the iPhone 12 mini's result, with a 3,302 score.Likewise, in our video encoding test, where we convert a 4K clip to 1080p using the Adobe Premiere Rush app and time the result, the iPhone 12 mini needed just 27 seconds to complete the task, compared to the Galaxy S20 FE’s 1 minute and 24 seconds. The older iPhone 11 needed 46 seconds, so it’s not just Android phones that the A14 outperforms.Finally, bringing it back to graphics, 3DMark’s Wild Life benchmark offered yet another glimpse at the iPhone 12 mini’s power. Apple's device tallied 39 frames per second in this test — identical to the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, and much better than the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (25 fps), OnePlus 8T (23 fps) and Pixel 5 (7 fps).Apple has gone all in on 5G for the iPhone 12 line, and that extends to the iPhone 12 mini as well. While it’s no longer rare to see 5G handsets for less than $700 anymore, it’s the iPhone 12 mini’s complete support of next-generation networks in all their forms that makes it a great 5G value.Most inexpensive or mid-range 5G phones support sub-6GHz 5G, which carries long distances across the country, but offers marginally better speeds than what LTE already delivers at best. But there’s also millimeter-wave (mmWave) 5G, which is mostly reserved for dense urban areas. Millimeter-wave networks can achieve multi-gigabit downloads, so long as you’re close enough to the 5G small cell node and have an unobstructed line-of-sight view.This latter form of 5G is the kind that most cheaper 5G phones skimp out on to save costs and battery life. However, the iPhone 12 mini supports mmWave 5G on every network, and even if you buy it unlocked. That, coupled with Apple’s claim that this device supports more 5G bands than any other handset, makes it the most future-proofed choice for a 5G phone on the market right now. It’s certainly the smallest 5G phone too, given that 5G phones tend to be larger to fit bigger batteries to offset their increased power draw.That said, don’t expect phenomenal speeds everywhere, especially over those low-band, sub-6GHz networks. In eatsern Pennsylvania I only saw download speeds hovering around 50Mbps over AT&T’s 5G in my testing. State-of-the-art LTE Advanced networks can download five times faster than that, so the presence of a 5G indicator on your iPhone’s screen doesn’t mean it’s going to be lightyears faster in every instance.5G also can consume a lot of power, which explains one of the iPhone 12’s other new features — Smart Data Mode. Enabled by default, Smart Data Mode drops the device back down to LTE to consume less power, typically when background processes are running or data is being streamed when the screen is off. If you notice Smart Data Mode resulting in longer downloads or not tapping into those faster data speeds as readily as you like, you could always turn it off — though, given the kinds of situations under which it operates, that’s probably unlikely.With such a small frame, the iPhone 12 can’t help but lose out to its brethren where battery life is concerned. Apple doesn’t publish battery life figures — you’ll have to wait for teardowns to reveal that information — but we do know that the larger iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro pack 2,815-mAh units.The 6.1-inch iPhone 12 lasted 8 hours and 25 minutes in our battery test, where devices repeatedly load web pages over mobile data (in this case, AT&T 5G) while set to 150 nits of screen brightness. The iPhone 12 mini, on the other hand, averaged 7 hours and 28 minutes on the same network.Any result in our test under 8 hours isn’t ideal; the Pixel 5, for example, lasted two hours longer, also on 5G, likely thanks to a significantly larger 4,000-mAh battery. At one point during my testing of the 12 mini, I streamed video and briefly gamed for three straight hours, and the phone’s battery life dropped to 50%. This probably won’t be the best device for users who really need every minute of longevity they can get during the day.The iPhone 12 mini doesn’t ship with a charger, though using Apple’s new 20-watt brick, we saw 60% in 30 minutes. The new MagSafe charging system, which offers peak speed of 15 watts, actually tops out at 12 watts for the iPhone 12 mini in particular. Given the smaller size of the mini’s battery, 12 watts should be fast enough to equal the other, larger iPhone 12 models in terms of charging times, but it is a small stipulation to be aware of nevertheless.All iPhone 12 models launched with iOS 14 — the latest version of Apple’s mobile operating system at the time. That update actually packs a number of sizable changes and upgrades compared to iOS 13. Most notably, the update adds support for more colorful, informative widgets that can be placed on any home screen, and introduces the App Library which organizes your apps into folders by type.Notifications are now more compact, obscuring less of the screen; Maps and Messages have been redesigned a bit to add extra functionality; and there’s a picture-in-picture mode that allows you to watch or listen to video no matter what app you’re currently using, among many other additions. For a deeper look into all of iOS 14’s features, check out our iOS 14.5 review.When iOS 15 arrives on Sept. 24, expect an easy upgrade for your iPhone 12 mini. We've got a look at the best iOS 15 features coming to all iPhones.The iPhone 12 mini is exactly the kind of device I wish more phone makers had the conviction to build. And Apple has, in the form of the iPhone 13 mini that offers more storage, a faster chipset and camera improvements.In a way, the iPhone 12 mini felt like the most impressive member of the iPhone 12 lineup, because it does everything the larger, more expensive models do, but amazingly fits all that capability into an impossible small frame.As I said when the iPhone 12 mini was announced, the arrival of 5G has forced us to accept so many compromises in the phones we buy. They’ve had to become significantly bigger, to accommodate more spacious batteries and all the necessary antennas and modems to support next-generation networks (especially the mmWave kind). They’ve also had to become more expensive, to offset the cost of all these new and emerging technologies and components.One could argue that the iPhone 12 mini isn’t as great a “deal” as it may seem. Sure, it now starts at $599 — on contract, mind you — but it’s also likely smaller than many consumers would be comfortable with. The majority of shoppers may flock to the 6.1-inch iPhone 12, which has also seen a price cut to $699.For some discerning buyers, though, this will be exactly the iPhone they’ve been waiting for, at a very agreeable price. The iPhone 12 mini answers the call for a premium small iPhone, and in doing so immediately rockets to the top of our list of the best small phones. It is an achievement of packaging, and a device without a true competitor, except for the newer iPhone 13 mini. So long as you can put up with a slight hit to battery life and don't need Apple's latest compact phone, the iPhone 12 mini is truly a phone in a class all its own."
30,Google Pixel 4,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/pixel-4,"The camera may be the Google Pixel 4's headline feature, but there's a lot more on offer with this phone. Especially when compared to the new, but also less impressive, Pixel 5. Whether it's the silky-smooth 90Hz display, super-secure Face-Unlock, and so much more.Unfortunately, as forward thinking as the Pixel 4 may be, Google still repeated a lot of the same frustrating mistakes. Plus, with the Pixel 5 not really having that wow factor, we've had to look forward to see if Google ever has any intention of fixing common Pixel problems like underpowered hardware and weak battery life.The Pixel 4's battery is too small, has a much shorter lifespan you'd expect, and that's why so many people have taken interest in the larger Pixel 4 XL instead. The base storage is also a concern, plus it's quite clear that the screen has a brightness issue. Even if it does look really nice.It's enough to make you want to buy a Pixel 5a instead. While the phone still has the same Snapdragon 765G chipset as the standard Pixel 5, Google managed to solve the battery issues with a phone that clocked in at nine hours and 45 minutes during our testing. And that would only set you back $449.Weak battery life is one foibles that are the most frustrating, because as our Pixel 4 review notes, this phone is otherwise close to perfection. Mountain View has yet again put on another master class in doing more with less and building a handset that's far greater — and smarter — than the sum of its parts. And with the Pixel 6 on the way, it means that buying a Pixel 4 is now less enticing than ever before. Especially if Google manages to offer solid performance and battery life on the upcoming handset.Sadly it meant the Pixel 4 never made it onto our best phones list, even when it was brand new.At launch, the Pixel 4 started at $799 for a 64GB model, with the 128GB variant costing $899. However, in the time since the phone's release, it's been heavily discounted on more than a few occasions, and Google no longer officially sells it. With the Pixel 5 out there and starting at $699, prices have continued to slide where the device is still in stock. Right now you can get brand new models for under $500, and refurbished ones for under $250 without having to look too carefully.The Pixel 4 was Google's first phone offered through all major carriers in the U.S. — Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint — as well as some discount and regional providers, like Visible, U.S. Cellular and, of course, Google Fi. You could also buy an unlocked phone and take it to practically any carrier. With support for both GSM and CDMA bands, the Pixel 4 is widely compatible with all U.S. networks that permit you to bring your own device.Google's flagship comes in two sizes: the 5.7-inch Pixel 4, which is the subject of this review, as well as the 6.3-inch Pixel 4 XL, which packs a significantly larger battery to match its bigger, higher-resolution screen. Otherwise, both models have the same specs and cameras, and are available in the same selection of colors: Just Black, Clearly White and limited-edition Oh So Orange, which is hard to track down these days.The past year has treated us to phones with motorized, pop-out selfie cameras; entire displays that slide down to reveal lenses; the narrowest of bezels; and exotic, dazzling exterior finishes.If these are the things you're looking for in your next handset, you should probably look elsewhere, because the Pixel 4 has none of them.The Pixel 4's design doesn't match Apple's, but it is delightfully weird — and damn, if there isn't space in this oversaturated market for weird.In fact, much like its predecessor, the Pixel 4 rejects most of the tech industry's notions of what constitutes thoughtful design. For starters, there's that eyesore of a square camera module on the rear. And while the bezel below the display has been trimmed to iPhone 11-esque proportions, the bezel above it is about as prominent as the Pixel 3's. (At least this time around, there are technical justifications for the bulky forehead, but we'll dive into those later.)On the backside, you won't find glass polished to look like metal that catches spectrums of light in hypnotic rays — just plain old solid colors. In fact, the rear of this Pixel seems especially sparse now that Google has ditched the capacitive fingerprint sensors of previous iterations in favor of Face Unlock.All this is to say that some might call the Pixel 4's über-minimalism and lack of an edge-to-edge screen ugly, and I can sort of understand that sentiment. When Samsung pushes the limits of packaging with devices like the Galaxy Note 10 — which manages to cram in three cameras, a stylus compartment and a generous battery — the Pixel 4 can't help but look a little humdrum.But these things are all a matter of taste, and personally, I dig the Pixel 4's unique aesthetic. I like the playful, lighthearted contrast of the Clearly White colorway, which combines a frosted Gorilla Glass 5 back with a powdered black aluminum frame and a traffic-cone orange power button. These things shouldn't go together, but against all odds, the funkiness has grown on me.And funky is the best way I can articulate the Pixel 4's vibe. The iPhone 11 Pro is, unquestionably, a more luxurious handset, with a noticeably heftier build and surgical-grade accouterments. Then again, at $999, it should be. The Pixel 4's design doesn't match Apple's, but it is delightfully weird — and damn, if there isn't space in this oversaturated market for weird.At 5.7 inches, the smaller Pixel 4 is also relatively accommodating for those who prefer compact handsets, and one of the best small phones you can buy. While it's about a tenth of an inch taller than the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro, Google's offering is also narrower by the same margin, making the Pixel slightly easier to reach across with your thumb. And in keeping parity with the Pixel 3, this one is also rated as IP68 water-resistant, meaning it should withstand 5 feet (1.5 meters) of submersion for up to 30 minutes.One more thing on the design front: While there are only three color options for the Pixel 4, Google deserves kudos for sweating the details and differentiating materials between them. Only the white and orange variants sport matte finishes on the back. That's in stark contrast to the all-business black version, which employs a glossier, stealthier and more slippery sheen. Personally, I prefer the matte version, but I can't deny the premium flair of the shiny option.The Pixel line has rarely been praised for its displays, but Google's fourth-generation handset goes a long way toward changing that reputation. The Pixel 4 is the first Google device with a screen capable of refreshing at 90Hz — a feature the company has dubbed Smooth Display.The 90Hz Smooth Display makes conventional 60-Hz phones feel sluggish.Smooth Display is on by default, and it essentially means the Pixel 4's 5.7-inch, 2280 x 1080 OLED panel updates on-screen content more frequently than the 60Hz displays in the majority of phones. A higher refresh rate translates to silkier animations that react to your inputs more immediately, in turn making the entire experience of using your phone snappier.The fluidity of 90Hz makes conventional displays feel sluggish. The Pixel 4 isn't the first handset with a panel like this. But its inclusion is nevertheless appreciated and reinforces that 90Hz should be the standard for flagships in the future.The refresh rate isn't the only improvement, though. The Pixel 4 has a new Ambient EQ feature, which modulates the white balance to suit lighting conditions. It's similar to Apple's True Tone system, and it works just as well in this implementation.While watching the trailer for Netflix's adorable and breathtaking stop-motion series Rilakkuma and Kaoru, I was impressed most by the dynamic range of the Pixel 4's display. The titular bear's fur was rendered with striking clarity in the highlights and shadows alike. I noticed that Google's device exhibits a warmer cast than the iPhone 11 Pro, even when Ambient EQ and True Tone are each turned off. Yet I liked the effect, and users who fancy a more realistic tint can switch to the Natural or Boosted color profiles in the Pixel's settings.In terms of numbers, the Pixel 4 didn't disappoint — at least, not out of the gate. Google's 130.1% coverage of the sRGB spectrum is a bit higher than the iPhone 11 Pro's 118.6%, indicating slightly more saturated hues on the Pixel. What's more, the Pixel 4's Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.34 is very close to the iPhone's 0.28, so you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)However, the Pixel 4's display came crashing back down when we measured its peak brightness. At just 429 nits through our light meter, Google's flagship is merely a candle compared with the white-hot intensity of the iPhone 11 Pro's category-leading 752-nit reading. The Galaxy Note 10 also far outmatched the Pixel 4, registering 674 nits.Indoors, you're less likely to mind a display that isn't the brightest. But step outside on a sunny day, and you'll have a much harder time reading the Pixel 4's screen. And for a phone that originally cost $800, that's not a nuisance you should have to tolerate.The Pixel 4's main camera is still rated at 12.2 megapixels. But there's a second shooter now — a 16-MP, ƒ/2.4 telephoto lens — that, when combined with Google's Super Res Zoom technology, gives the Pixel 4 incredible range: up to 8x with limited loss of quality.Super Res Zoom is a microcosm of Google's entire imaging strategy with the Pixel 4: to use a mix of computational photography and artificial intelligence to do what hardware alone cannot. Take the new AI white balancing, for example, which automatically color-corrects strongly tinted images using a machine-learning model trained on thousands of similar scenarios. Then there's Live HDR+, which processes your optimized HDR output in real time through the viewfinder so you know what the final product will look like before you tap the shutter button.Because the Pixel 4 works so much of its magic in the background, without user intervention, it's never easy to tell precisely the difference any one feature is contributing independently. All you can really go on are the results — and they speak for themselves.Case in point: this stunning scene inside the New York Public Library, which the Pixel 4 painted with brilliant contrast and a nuanced touch, especially in the highlights. The iPhone 11 Pro struggles to rein in the light breaking through the window underneath the ornate ceiling. Apple's device also dials down the shadows to an almost unnatural level while applying a warm cast. Some onlookers might be put off by the relative darkness of the Pixel's shot, but I love how Google's optics capture the richness of the cherry tones in the carvings and pillars adorning the walls.Outside the library, we dialed the zoom up to 2x on both handsets to capture a close-up on a pair of street signs. For a phone with a secondary telephoto lens, the Pixel 4's approach is unconventional. There's no tapping to enable optical at 2x power as there is on the iPhone 11 Pro or Samsung's range-topping Galaxy handsets. The camera UI encourages users to zoom continuously, as if they were using a single lens, rather than switching between wide and telephoto perspectives. There's a seamless interplay between the optical advantage of that second camera and the moment when Super Res Zoom kicks in.Super Res Zoom works well, using natural hand movement to collect additional data points for a crisper photo. When we enlarged both images, it became clear that Google levies significant noise reduction on solid colors, particularly within the signs themselves. On the flip side, that leads to oversmoothing in places, compared with the iPhone 11 Pro. Apple's rendition is also brighter, with more eye-catching specular highlights on the metal screws at the center of the pole. The edges of the Fifth Ave. and West 41st St. signs also reflect the light with more pronounced contrast, which helps to convey texture.Next, my colleague Phil and I took to Bryant Park on a chilly, dreary fall day to snag a pair of portraits using each phone's bokeh mode. The Pixel 4 doesn't draw quite as close to the subject as the iPhone 11 Pro can, so Phil's hair, skin tone and blue sweater appear slightly blurrier through Google's lenses. Meanwhile, Apple's software punches up the saturation too much, especially in Phil's cheeks, which don't look particularly realistic either. Ultimately, neither device gets this one totally right, but the iPhone 11 Pro is closer to the ideal.You'd never believe these two photos were taken at the same time of day based on the difference in lighting. Once again, the iPhone 11 Pro plays up the warmth well beyond the actual ambient lighting conditions. It might make for a cozier, more picturesque scene, but I wouldn't call it true to life. The Pixel 4 doesn't manipulate the white balance as heavily, but it does double down on the shadows, leaving less detail in darker regions of the frame.Night Sight on the Pixel 4 produced a striking scene elsewhere in the park, exposing the tree trunks, the bed of green beneath them and the faces of nearby buildings more clearly than the iPhone 11 Pro could manage. Perhaps the Pixel 4's rendition is a bit cooler than it should be, but everything's a bit better focused compared with the image produced by Apple's Night Mode, which comes off slightly blurry and dim by comparison.To test out the limitations of Super Res Zoom, I closed in on carvings adorning the library's facade. Sure, the Pixel 4's 8x attempt isn't perfect, but it's worlds better than 8x from the Galaxy S10, which doesn't benefit from the same kind of AI-based sharpening as Google's zoom shots. Add in that this photo was taken in the dark, using Night Sight, and it's remarkable how Google has been able to overcome hardware limitations that have quelled the rest of the industry using computational photography pretty much alone.And yet there's more you can do with the Pixel 4's cameras. New Dual Exposure controls allow you to adjust highlights and shadows independently while shooting. As with Live HDR+, you'll see the results in real time, which makes the whole experience more intuitive. Although I did play around with Dual Exposure, I found that Google's HDR system usually knew how to get the best shot — so, in most situations, it won't be particularly relevant. That said, I suspect professionals will love the potential for creativity.You'd hope the Pixel 4's three-dimensional Face Unlock system would work well, because there's no fingerprint sensor to fall back on. Much like Apple's Face ID technology, Google's system unites an array of infrared cameras, a flood illuminator and a dot projector to identify your face reliably.The way Motion Sense enhances Face Unlock is the phone's cleverest feature. The radar chip knows when you reach for the Pixel 4, so it's ready to identify you before you wake it.Theoretically, Google's Face Unlock is secure enough to be used for mobile payments, too. I say ""theoretically"" because it's not yet supported in any of the banking apps I use, which previously worked with fingerprint sensors. That's an issue Google admits it must solve quickly, though it's mostly the responsibility of third-party developers.In practice, however, Google's first crack at Face Unlock works well and offers a few advantages over Apple's approach. It works when the Pixel 4 is lying flat, and it even registers when the device is held in landscape orientation. The iPhone 11's TrueDepth camera has improved over its predecessor in the first regard, but not the second.Face Unlock on the Pixel 4 even works while your eyes are closed, though Google has come under scrutiny for this; the company has since added an optional setting in an update that forces the phone to confirm attention before unlocking.Overall, the system is very fast, which brings us to the Pixel 4's other party piece: Motion Sense. Built upon Google's Project Soli radar technology, Motion Sense allows the Pixel 4 to monitor midair gestures and other movement around it.You can wave your hand above the phone to skip tracks in apps like Spotify and YouTube or snooze alarms. When you do either, you'll see a subtle glow move across the top edge of the display, indicating that the Soli radar sees your hand and recognizes its placement.But the way Motion Sense enhances Face Unlock is probably Google's cleverest use of the feature. The Soli chip knows when you reach for the Pixel 4, even when the phone is sleeping. Once it realizes you're motioning to use your device, it fires up the Face Unlock stack so it's ready to identify you before you wake it.Those gestures are surprisingly intuitive, but there's a slight learning curve. There's some muscle memory you'll have to ascertain, particularly with that waving shortcut. Fast, passing motions are preferred; slower actions seem to confuse the radar.One Motion Sense annoyance is that, when you're skipping a succession of songs, the Pixel 4 sometimes erroneously registers movement back to your hand's starting position as an intentional gesture. In other words, if you wave your hand from right to left to go forward one track and then move your hand back to the right to do it again, that return motion will trigger a skip in the opposite direction unless you're really careful about keeping your hand away from the device.Motion Sense isn't perfect, and Google still has work to do. But it's not the fundamentals or usability that have me concerned but that there's so little you can do with Motion Sense outside of controlling media playback and snoozing alarms. The functionality feels pretty limited even a year since the phone's release, similar to Google's Active Edge squeezing feature, which returns from last year's model and once again has little use outside of summoning your Assistant.That's really a shame, because Google decided to sideline Motion Sense and Face Unlock in the new Pixel 5, marking an unfortunate and untimely end for the company's promising experiments. Hopefully, it's not the last we'll see of them.The flagship Pixel received a noticeable performance bump for 2019, moving to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 chip and gaining another 2GB of RAM compared with the Pixel 3, for a total of 6GB. In fact, that 855 silicon is still faster than the newer 765G chipset inside the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5.The 855 brought necessary improvements for its time, but they still left the Pixel 4 behind other premium Android phones — not to mention Apple's A13 Bionic-powered iPhones, which at launch were among the best-performing in the industry. That divide has only grown larger in the two years since the Pixel 4 was releasedIn Geekbench 5, which evaluates overall system performance, the Pixel 4 delivered a multicore score of 2,329. The $599 OnePlus 7T, which utilizes Qualcomm's slightly faster 855 Plus chip and has 8GB of RAM, finished well ahead, at 2,759. The iPhone 11 demolished both, at 3,251.Graphics crunching didn't end much better for the Pixel, with Google's phone notching 4,923 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test. That's serviceable yet behind the Note 10 (5,374), which utilizes the same processor but has more RAM. And unsurprisingly, it trails the iPhone 11 Pro (6,163) by an even larger margin.The numbers aren't record-setting, but Google's phones have never been about raw performance. Rest assured that the Pixel 4 still feels snappy in regular use and handles demanding games, like Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile, about as well as other flagships. And just like its rivals, the Pixel 4 starts to heat up when you ratchet the battle royale shooter's graphics up to HDR quality with anti-aliasing.What the benchmarks don't tell you is that the Pixel 4 has an all-new coprocessor — the Pixel Neural Core — joining the Visual Core and Titan M security chip. As the name suggests, it's the Neural Core that is tasked with accelerating machine-learning tasks and handling Google's on-device language models, allowing many Assistant tasks to be conducted locally.As a result, Google Assistant feels really fast on the Pixel 4, with commands deciphered at a pace I've never witnessed on another handset. That includes the iPhone 11 Pro, which took nearly 10 seconds to respond to a simple alarm command. In contrast, the Pixel 4 clapped back with an alarm set for 5 p.m. almost instantaneously.Between the 90Hz display, Soli radar and all the sensors and projectors necessary for Face Unlock, the Pixel 4 packs a lot of additional power-sipping components the Pixel 3 did not. So you'd imagine Google would have increased the size of the battery, right?The Pixel 4's battery life is not only worse than the Pixel 3's; it's well off the longevity of the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S10.Actually, quite the opposite. At 2,800 mAh, the Pixel 4 has a smaller battery than the 2,915-mAh unit in the Pixel 3, and a much smaller one compared to the 3,700-mAh Pixel 4 XL. That doesn't sound encouraging, and well, the results weren't, either.In Tom's Guide's battery test, which forces the device to endlessly refresh web pages while set to 150 nits of screen brightness, the Pixel 4 called it quits after an average of 8 hours and 3 minutes, across two tests. One additional session, run with the display adjusted to a less-energy-consuming 60Hz, produced a slightly better time of 8 hours and 36 minutes.How does that compare to other flagships? It's not only worse than the Pixel 3 (8:27) but well off the longevity of the iPhone 11 (11:16), iPhone 11 Pro (10:24) and Galaxy S10 (10:19). In an age when high-end phone makers are finally listening to consumers and sacrificing some thinness for much-needed endurance, Google is still inexplicably reluctant to follow suit.During one day of moderate use — no photography or gaming, but lots of browsing, flipping between apps and messaging — I made it from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. with 23% of the battery left. That's not much better than the Pixel 3 I've been using for a year now.At least the packaged 18-watt USB-PD charger helps the Pixel 4 juice back up rather quickly; it got to 47% capacity in exactly 30 minutes in our testing. It's the same adapter that came with the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL, so no improvements have been made there. Additionally, the Pixel 4 again supports wireless charging, either over third-party Qi pads or Google's own Pixel Stand.It's worth pointing out the the Pixel 5 has a much larger battery than the Pixel 4, rated at 4,080 mAh. Thus, if longevity on a charge is a serious concern for you, we recommend going with the newer model instead.Like you'd expect from a Google phone, the Pixel 4 launched with Android 10, was the first phone to get Android 11 and will be supported with updates until 2022. Three years of major version upgrades is more than the two that most flagship phones get, and because they're coming directly from Google, you won't have to wait six months before Android's newest features trickle down to your device.If you're interested in a deep dive into the Pixel 4's operating system, you can head over to our Android 11 review. But since the Pixel 4 also supports the Android 12 beta, and will be among the first devices to get the next version of Android when it arrives.With Android 10, however, the Pixel 4 marked Live Caption's debut. The feature is like omnipresent subtitles across your phone. No matter what's on screen or what app you're using, if there's speech, Live Caption will spell it out, on the fly. There's a short delay between the audio and the caption, because the Pixel 4's Neural Core is transcribing what it hears in real time. It even modifies earlier words and punctuation based on contextual cues that become evident later.Live Caption is a powerful tool that leverages the Pixel 4's artificial intelligence in a useful way. But it does expend a lot of battery power, as Google points out the moment you switch on the feature (which, conveniently enough, you can do right from the volume slider). So you won't want to leave Live Caption on indefinitely.The intelligence that powers Live Caption has also been extended to Recorder, Google's built-in voice recording app. With the power of machine-learning-aided transcription that's remarkably accurate, the Pixel 4's recording software has instantly become my favorite way to record interviews. (And fortunately, it's already been isolated as an APK that can be sideloaded on other handsets.)Over time, the Pixel 4 should continue to learn new tricks, since Google announced an initiative to regularly update the device with ""feature drops"" that include new capabilities. The introductory drop, released in December 2019, added enhancements to Duo video calls, memory management improvements, the ability to add bokeh into old portraits via the Photos app and automated Call Screen using the Google Assistant.Previous Pixels came with unlimited original-quality photo storage in Google Photos for several years, but surprisingly, Google has eliminated this hugely beneficial perk. Images captured on your Pixel 4 count against your Google Photos storage cap if stored at full quality, just like on any other device. If you're low on space, you can back up content at ""high"" quality, but those pictures and videos will be compressed.It's a very disappointing decision, given the Pixel 4's phenomenal imaging. Google clearly wants to move customers to cloud storage subscriptions, as evidenced by the free three-month trial of Google One that the company includes with this device. But losing this bonus makes the Pixel 4 not only a less-compelling value but a less-attractive mobile camera.If you're interested in a more affordable take on the Pixel 4 that trades processing power and a few other luxuries for a lower price the Pixel 4a and new Pixel 5a are very much worth considering.The Pixel 4a has the same 12.2-megapixel main camera as in the Pixel 4, and captures images every bit as attractive. It also incorporates Super Res Zoom and Smart HDR, so you're not losing a whole lot compared to Google's pricier flagship.The Pixel 4a only costs $349, and yet it still offers 128GB of built-in storage, an OLED display (albeit, only a 60Hz one) and some of Google's best AI-laden features, like its Recorder transcription app and Call Screen. It's one of the best cheap phones out there today, and a more than worthy adversary for Apple's iPhone SE. There's also the Pixel 4a 5G to consider, which adds connectivity to next-generation networks, as well as the $449 Pixel 5a which features a larger battery and more powerful chipset than the Pixel 4a series.In fact the Pixel 5a is so good that we've already declared it the 'king of cheap phones' in our review. It may be $100 more than the $399 the Pixel 4 commands these days, but it also packs in a large screen, bigger battery, and a stronger battery life. Camera performance isn't too shabby eitherThe Pixel 5a may not have as powerful a chipset as the Pixel 4, rocking the same Snapdragon 765G as the Pixel 5, it's arguably got a lot more going for it than its now-two year old predecessor. The only issue is price, but the extra $100 may well be worth it.The Pixel w4 was a pretty hard sell when it was new, thanks to the poor battery life, which was a shame. The 2019 Google phone was otherwise pretty great, with clever software with a number of unique features like Face Unlock and Motion Sense. It also had one of the finest cameras we've ever seen on a phone.But it was killed by the fact its battery wasn't up to scratch, and its display was just too dim to read outdoors. Limited storage options certainly didn't help either. The only option at the time was the Pixel 4 XL, which offered much of the same features but without the major problems - albeit at the expense of the standard model's smaller size.Herein 2021, with the launch of the Pixel 6 imminent, and with the Pixel 4a, Pixel 5, and Pixel 5a  already out in the world, the Pixel 4 is even less appealing. The phones that came after it may not be as powerful, or feature-packed, but they were cheaper and offered better battery performance. And if rumors regarding the Pixel 6 are true, it has more than enough to blow the Pixel 4 right out of the running for ""most powerful Pixel phone"".So should you go out and buy a Pixel 4 right now? No, you should not. Even if the Pixel 6 isn't to your liking when it is announced, there are still plenty of other Pixel options for you to choose from that don't have the Pixel 4's shortcomings."
31,Google Pixel 4a 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-the-best-5g-phone-value,"Starting price: $499/£499 Screen size: 6.2-inch FHD OLED (1080 x 2340); 60Hz refresh rate CPU: Snapdragon 765G RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB Rear cameras: 12MP main (ƒ/1.7 ); 16MP ultra-wide (ƒ/2.2) Front camera: 8MP (ƒ/2.0) Battery size: 3,885 mAh Charging: 18W wired Size: 6.1 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches (153.9 x 74 x 8.2 mm) Weight: 5.9 ounces (168 grams)The Google Pixel 4a 5G remains a good buy despite it now having been replaced by the Google Pixel 5a. Particularly for U.K. customers where the 5a isn't currently sold.While the basic Pixel 4a was for people who wanted the best camera phone in the cheapest possible device; the Pixel 4a 5G aimed for people who want a competitively-priced camera phone but also 5G connectivity, better performance and a larger display.There are a slew of other mid-range 5G phones which the Google Pixel 4a 5G goes toe-to-toe against — an LG Velvet here, a Galaxy A71 5G there. And I think it fares pretty well, as Google's expertise with mobile photography outweighs any concerns about the Pixel's subpar battery.But in many ways, the real competitor to the Pixel 4a 5G are other Google phones. Aside from the Pixel 5a, the Pixel 5 shares much in common with its cheaper sibling — so much so that ultimately, the Pixel 4a 5G gets the better of any comparison. If you want a 5G phone from Google, and can't wait for the Pixel 6 or can't get the Pixel 5a, the Pixel 4a 5G is the one to get.There's one version of the Google Pixel 4a 5G — a 128GB model with 6GB of RAM — and it will cost you $499/£499. That's $200/£200 cheaper than the Pixel 5 despite sharing many of the same components. You will pay $150/£150 more over the basic Pixel 4a though, which may strike some as a steep premium for 5G connectivity. The Pixel 4a 5G is only $20 more than the starting price of the Pixel 3a XL, which doesn't work with 5G. (See how the latest Pixels compare to their predecessors in our Google Pixel 4a vs. Pixel 3a comparison.)Google sells the phone unlocked, and you can also buy versions from the Google Store that are tied to Verizon and Google Fi. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon all stock the Pixel 4a 5G themselves too.One note about the Pixel 4a 5G sold through Verizon — it costs $100 more than the standard $499 version. That's because it's designed to work with Google's high-speed mmWave-based 5G towers that outperform 5G networks built on low- to mid-band spectrum. Verizon 5G features mmWave in 51 cities, while a nationwide network built on lower band spectrum launched in October. (You'll still get 5G with the Pixel 4a 5G without mmWave, but it only be a little bit faster than LTE.)The Pixel 4a 5G is a handsome phone, and at times, when it was sitting face-up on my desk opposite of a Pixel 4 XL, I had to do a double-take before I knew which phone to grab. That's not the case when the Pixel 4a 5G is flipped over — the back is made from plastic, and it definitely looks it.You may not get a fancy glass or metal frame to lend your phone a touch of style, but the Pixel 4a 5G is still comfortable to hold. Even with a 6.2-inch screen, it's fairly lightweight at just 5.9 ounces (168 grams). The fancier-looking LG Velvet tips the scales at 6.3 ounces, and if you like easier-to-carry handsets, the Pixel 4a 5G's lighter weight makes a world of difference.The edges on the Pixel 4a 5G are fairly plain, with the power button (in a contrasting white on the Just Black version of the phone) and volume rocker on the right side. The top contains a headphone jack, which is good news for people still using wired headphones and earphones.On the back of the phone, a little bit southeast of the rear camera array, Google included a fingerprint sensor. The location seems a little high up for my taste, as I sometimes had trouble locating the sensor. Maybe that explains why it occasionally took me a couple of tries to unlock the Pixel 4a 5G, especially when I was holding it with my right hand.Buy the Google Pixel 4a 5G from the Google Store, and you can only pick the Just Black option. That's also the only color offered to U.K. buyers. Verizon currently gives you a choice between black and white, which aren't exactly the most vibrant color decisions you'll ever be asked to make.Like the Pixel 4a and Pixel 5, the Pixel 4a 5G uses an AMOLED display with an FHD resolution, and a punch-hole notch for the front camera in the top left corner. At 6.2 inches across, the Pixel 4a 5G is the largest of the 2020 Pixel line-up, beating the 5.8-inch Pixel 4a and 6-inch Pixel 5. The display is one of the biggest trade-offs you'll make when you choose between the Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5. It's not that the more expensive Pixel has a more colorful screen — it covers 128.8% of the sRGB color spectrum, compared to 128.3% by the Pixel 4a 5G. Rather, the Pixel 5 offers a 90Hz refresh rate that can make scrolling smoother and other content more immersive. The Pixel 4a 5G goes with a more conventional 60Hz rate.Set the two phones side by side and you'll notice a difference. A phone with a faster-refreshing display offers a better experience overall. I'm not sure it's $200 worth of difference, though, and unless you're downgrading from a phone that already offered a fast-refreshing screen, you're not likely to be bothered by its absence on the Pixel 4a 5G.The Pixel 4a 5G's screen is colorful enough, though the LG Velvet captures more of the sRGB color spectrum at 140.6%. Colors are just as accurate on both phones, though, as they have equal Delta-E rating of 0.3. That's about equal to the Pixel 4a's 0.29 rating, but behind the iPhone SE and its 0.2 score. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)One of my biggest complaints with last year's Pixel 3a lineup was the dim screen Google used on its budget phone. Things have improved with the Pixel 4a 5G, which can reach a maximum brightness of 638 nits when you've got Adaptive Brightness turned on. That's not as good as the Pixel 4a's 681-nit rating, but in line with the iPhone SE's 625 nits. It's also ahead of mid-tier 5G phones like the LG Velvet (567 nits), Motorola Edge (558 nits) and Galaxy A71 5G (481 nits).Just make sure you have Adaptive Brightness enabled when you go outside. Otherwise, brightness tops out at 411 nits for the Pixel 4a 5G, and the glossiness of the display can make it very hard to make out details in the bright sun. I had to squint when watching Hail, Caesar! on Netflix or playing PUBG Mobile to get the full picture of what I was looking at when outdoors.Indoors, I found the Pixel 4a 5G's display nice and colorful, whether it as Channing Tatum's clean dress whites from a Hail, Caesar! musical or the green wallpaper in the bar where he was dancing. The YouTube trailer for Stardust also reflected the muted '70s colors as well as Johnny Flynn's transformation from David Bowie to the magenta-haired Ziggy Stardust.While Pixel 4a owners make do with a single rear camera, the Google Pixel 4a 5G gets the same set of sensors as the Pixel 5 — a 12MP main lens along with a 16MP ultrawide shooter. Google's superlative computational photography is along for the ride, too.Those cameras are probably the best thing about the Pixel 5, and the same can be said here. Even better, you're paying $200 less for photos that look just as good as the ones captured by Google's flagship.The Pixel 4a 5G does a solid job capturing this photo of some breakfast tacos, even with some unforgiving light streaming in from a kitchen window to the right of the shot. The colors are accurate — from the bright red peppers to the dollop of sour cream. I also like how the Pixel kept everything in focus, even the taco in the background. That same taco doesn't look as sharp in the LG Velvet's photo and the colors seem to have an overly yellow cast to them. The differences are minor but they're enough to separate a decent midtier camera phone like the Velvet from a superior one like the Pixel 4a 5G.That's not to say the Pixel 4a 5G nails every shot. There's nothing really wrong with this scene of a foggy Santa Cruz cliffside, though I think the LG Velvet does a better job overall depicting the fog in the shot, particularly as it wraps around the trees in the far background. The Velvet's photo shows a more detailed texture for the tree trunk in the left foreground of the shot, while that same tree looks much darker in the Pixel's shot. That said, the Pixel 4a 5G more successfully handles the sunlight breaking through the fog and backlighting the tree on the right-hand side of the photo. You have a little over-exposure in the LG Velvet's image.How does the Pixel 4a 5G fare against beefier competition? To find out, I used Google's phone and an iPhone 11 Pro Max to shoot a picture of my favorite surfer. You'd really be hard-pressed to say which photo came from which phone, though if you study the details, the iPhone 11 Pro Max did a better job highlighting the patches of blue in an otherwise foggy sky. Still, you wouldn't look at those two photos and see $600 worth of difference, particularly in the way the Pixel 4a 5G matches the iPhone's ability to capture the surfer's reflection on the water of the tide pool.Speaking of tide pools, I used last year's Google flagship — the Pixel 4 XL — to shoot a picture of a tide pool to see just how much the Pixel 4a 5G could replicate its more expensive predecessor. And I think these pictures come as close to being a perfect match as possible. Both pick up the details of mussels clinging to the surrounding rocks and you can see a fairly detailed outline of a sea anemone just underneath the surface of the water. If you want a flagship-quality camera without the accompanying price, the Pixel 4a 5G is as close as you're going to get.I'm also impressed by how the Pixel 4a 5G makes the most of Google's prowess with computation photography. The Night Sight feature on the Pixel 4a 5G produces photos as sharp as any Pixel phone and can go toe-to-toe with the low-light photo mode of handsets like the iPhone 11 Pro Max. You could argue that the Pixel 4a 5G better captures some of the nuances of the flowers in this picture of Halloween decorations, though I think the iPhone does a better job with the shading on the skull to the right of the flowers, not to mention the background lighting. Still, this Pixel 4a 5G low-light shot is better than anything produced by a sub-$500 phone should be.I think the Pixel 4a 5G also does a credible job with portrait shots, at least determining where the background ends and the subject begins. The outline of my daughter is very distinct in the Pixel 4a 5G's photo, unlike with the iPhone 11 Pro Max where some of her hair and a little halo around her left should get caught up in the blur. I also prefer that the Pixel 4a 5G's shot includes more of the background, though that can be a personal preference. Where the iPhone excels is skin tone — you can still see my daughter's freckles, while the Pixel over smoothes her face. (This happens a lot with Google phones.) And I just think the blur on the iPhone's shot looks a little more natural and less computer-generated.Turning back to a phone in the Pixel 4a 5G's price class, we see how much better its 8MP front camera can handle selfies than the front shooter on the LG Velvet. My face looks hearty and healthy in the Pixel's shot. Perhaps my skin's a little too smooth, but it's a very good shot with balanced colors and lighting. The Velvet makes me look as if I've seen a ghost, draining all the color from my face and making me look slightly over-exposed.We find more similarities between the Google Pixel 4a 5G and the Pixel 5 when it comes to their processors. Both use a Snapdragon 765G, which isn't the most powerful chip you'll find in this year's best Android phones. But it is a processor favored by phone makers who want to offer 5G-ready devices — the Snapdragon 765G includes a built-in 5G modem — but don't want their phones to cost as much as the priciest flagships. The LG Velvet also uses the Snapdragon 765G, while the Galaxy A71 and Motorola Edge use a slightly lower-powered Snapdragon 765.On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the Pixel 4a 5G had the worst multicore score of any of those Snapdragon 765/765G-powered phones, posting a result of 1,614. That wasn't far off the Pixel 5's 1,617 result, but the A71 (1,796), Motorola Edge (1,867) and LG Velvet (1,927) finished well ahead of that mark. The Motorola and LG phones have the same amount of RAM as the Pixel 4a 5G, so that doesn't really explain the difference in scores. In graphics testing, the Pixel 4a 5G also trailed the rest of the field, scoring a 2,885 in 3DMark's SlingShot OpenGL test, compared to 4,644 for the LG Velvet and 4,237 for the Motorola Edge. On a newer 3DMark graphic test, Wild Life Unlimited, the Pixel 4a 5G at least edged the Pixel 5, with a score of 1,199 (7 frames per second) to the Pixel 5's 1,160 (also 7 fps). The LG Velvet outperformed both phones with a score of 1,680 (10 fps).Ultimately, this probably won't affect users who turn to their phone to run basic apps like social media, email and web browsing. I even found that demanding games like PUBG Mobile run just fine on the Pixel 4a 5G, even if I've seen sharper-looking graphics on more powerful phones. It's just a little disappointing that the Pixel 4a 5G appears to be at the back of the class for Snapdragon 765G-powered devices.That letter and number at the end of the Pixel 4a 5G name tells you all you need to know about what networks this phone connects to. Like the Pixel 5, the Google Pixel 4a 5G works with the emerging 5G networking standard.U.S. customers can either connect to sub-6GHz networks like the kind favored by AT&T, T-Mobile and now Verizon for their nationwide coverage. High-speed networks like Verizon's mmWave-based Ultra Wideband network require a different model that's a little thicker and heavier to make up for the extra antennas — and more expensive, as we mentioned. Otherwise, it's the same as the standard Pixel 4a 5G. (In the U.K. Google only sells a sub-6GHz version of the phone, which makes sense since it's the only kind of 5G available in the country.)You may have heard about 1 Gbps speeds with 5G, but temper your expectations. At this point, the most widespread form of 5G is just a little bit faster than the LTE you're used to. Using a T-Mobile SIM on the Pixel 4a 5G, I can connect to T-Mobile 5G, but I only get 25 Mbps download speeds, which is a hair or two better than T-Mobile LTE in my area. Such modest speed gains — for sub-6GHz 5G anyhow — may make you wonder if you're better off getting the cheaper Pixel 4a and its LTE-only connectivity. That depends on how long you plan to hold on to your phone. 5G performance is going to improve, and if you've already picked up a 5G phone like the Pixel 4a 5G, you'll benefit from that improvement over time.You get 3,855 mAh of battery capacity with the Pixel 4a 5G, which is quite a lot more than the Pixel 4a (3,140 mAh) and a little less than the Pixel 5 (4,080 mAh). That should be enough to keep the Pixel 4a 5G powered up, but 5G can be a demanding connectivity standard.The Pixel 4a 5G didn't fare very well in our battery test, in which we set the phone's display to 150 nits of brightness and have it surf the web over cellular — in this case, T-Mobile's 5G — until it runs out of power. The Pixel 4a 5G averaged 8 hours and 12 minutes on our test, which is well below the average for smartphones. It's also not in line with similarly priced 5G phones, as the LG Velvet lasted 10:29 and the Galaxy A71 5G fared even better at 10:49.To be fair, the Pixel 4a 5G held up well in daily use, as I was often able to make it through a day of gaming, video watching and surfing without needing to recharge the battery. We'll continue to investigate why the Pixel 4a 5G fared so poorly on our battery test, though it's worth noting other recent 5G phones did not have the same problem.To help with longevity, Google uses adaptive battery software to analyze how best to manage the apps and processes going on in the Pixel 4a 5G’s circuitry. It promises to prioritize powering the features you’re actually using and reduce the drain from your lesser-used apps, therefore eking out the most from the battery. This isn't something you're likely to notice working the moment you begin using your Pixel, as some time is required to ""learn"" your habits, though it could extend endurance down the line.Google also boasts that the Pixel 4a 5G can use its Extreme Battery Saver mode to last up to two days before needing to charge again. You're unlikely to need this most of the time, but it could certainly be handy if you need to stretch out the power you have left.The Pixel 4a 5G charges up somewhat quickly, thanks to 18W charging. In 15 minutes, you can charge the phone up to 23%, and 46% in half an hour. That's well ahead of the iPhone SE, which only got up to 29% after 30 minutes with its 5W charger. The LG Velvet was a slowpoke, too, only reaching 24% in half-an-hour. One thing you can't do with the Pixel 4a 5G is charge the phone wirelessly. That's a feature that didn't make it over from the more expensive Pixel 5.Early access to the latest version of Android used to be the Pixel's exclusive calling card, and while you'll find Android 11 on the Pixel 4a 5G, it's not a unique proposition anymore. The OnePlus 8T also ships with Android 11 pre-installed. At least Pixel owners can count on Android updates reaching their phones as soon as they're available.Android 11 introduces some nice improvements — even long-time iPhone users will appreciate the snap of changing apps and swiping between home screens. Google also offers some special features you won't find in Android 11 on other phones. For instance, suggested apps will now appear just above the search bar based on contextual clues and AI.Like Google's previous phones, the Pixel 4a 5G also has call screening to fend off robocallers and the excellent Recorder app with its genius automatic transcription. Recorder adds handy new editing features that lets you trim an audio file by highlighting text in the transcript and chopping it out. Another Recorder feature lets you share a video of your recording, transcript and all.Like the Pixel 5, the Pixel 4a 5G adds Google's new Hold for Me feature (though, you do have to enable it by going into the setting of the phone app and turning Hold for Me on). With Hold for Me, when you're placed on hold, you can task the Google Assistant to listen to that horrible hold music on your behalf, alerting you when a human operator is on the line to talk to you.The Google Pixel 4a 5G hits the market at a time when other similarly priced 5G phones have become the rule rather than the exception. And while other 5G phones certainly deliver better battery life and a little more processing oomph than the Pixel 4a 5G, Google's phone provides something those phones can't offer — a camera that produces pictures to rival what more expensive flagship phones are capable of.In fact, after conducting this Google Pixel 4a 5G review, I can't help but feel that it's not the likes of the LG Velvet or Galaxy A71 5G or any one of a number of mid-range handsets that this phone is competing against. Rather, the Pixel 4a 5G's biggest competitor appears to be the Pixel 5.On that front, the Pixel 4a 5G holds up very well. It doesn't have the 90Hz refresh rate that the Pixel 5 offers nor the IP68 water resistance. But at $200 less, you're getting an excellent camera, 5G connectivity and no real trade-off in terms of overall performance. Google now offers two 5G-ready devices between the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G. And it's clear to me that the Pixel 4a 5G is the better buy.Richard Priday contributed to an earlier hands-on with the Google Pixel 4a 5G."
32,OnePlus Nord N10 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review,"The OnePlus Nord N10 5G is a good phone for a good price. It's just a pity that it struggles to stand out among some very well rounded competitors.Normally, the release of a low-cost 5G phone like the OnePlus Nord N10 5G would be greeted with a lot of anticipation, particularly from the phone maker's dedicated fans. But this latest budget device has a hard act to follow, with the OnePlus Nord having made its debut in 2020 to enthusiastic reviews — and envious stares from the parts of the world where it wasn't launched. Starting price: $299/£329 Screen size: 6.49-inches (2400 x 1080; 90Hz refresh rate) CPU: Snapdragon 690 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.8); 8MP ultrawide (f/2.25); macro lens; monochrome lens Front camera: 16MP (f/2.05) Battery size: 4,300 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 11:48 Size: 6.4 x 2.9 x 0.35 inches Weight: 6.7 ouncesThe original Nord, and the OnePlus Nord 2 that followed it, have it all — a solid design, better-than-expected specs like a fast-refresh display and 5G connectivity and a low starting price that you wouldn't expect to be attached to such a capable device. But the OnePlus Nord and Nord 2 have been limited to Europe and India, leaving US customers out in the cold.The OnePlus Nord N10 5G changes that. Like the original Nord, the N10 5G marks OnePlus' return to its roots as a low-cost phone maker, but this time, the trade-off is more pronounced. The processor inside the OnePlus Nord N10 5G isn't as powerful as the first OnePlus Nord, it uses different cameras, and there's only one storage option this time around.Do these concessions make a difference? Can this phone compete with the Google Pixel a-series or the iPhone SE? In our OnePlus Nord N10 5G review, we find a phone that may not reach the heights of the original OnePlus Nord but that still delivers a lot of value for a shockingly low price.The OnePlus Nord N10 5G has been available in the UK since Nov. 14, where it debuted for £329 in a Midnight Ice Option that features 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It landed in North America on Jan. 15, where it costs $299.That's a very low price for a 5G-capable phone, considering that many of the best 5G phones approach $1,000. Up until the Nord N10 5G's arrival, the cheapest 5G device we've seen has been the TCL 10 5G UW, a Verizon-exclusive that costs $399 — or $100 more than the N10 5G.You can buy the OnePlus Nord N10 5G from OnePlus itself or from Amazon, Best Buy and B&H. Significantly, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile will offer the OnePlus Nord N10 5G (as well as a cheaper phone, the $179 OnePlus Nord N100, which lacks 5G). If you want to buy the N10 5G in installments, you'll pay $12.50 a month over 24 months at T-Mobile.The design of the OnePlus Nord N10 5G is the first hint that you're shopping in the bargain section for your next phone. It's not that the N10 is ugly, but it doesn't look very premium, and its plastic feel won't fool anyone into thinking you're carrying around a flagship handset.That said, the Nord N10 5G follows the design cues of recent OnePlus releases — a full-screen display on the front with a rectangular camera array positioned in the upper left corner on the back of the phone. The backside of the OnePlus Nord N10 5G also includes a fingerprint sensor housed just above the OnePlus logo, while you'll find a headphone jack on the bottom of the device next to the USB-C charging port.At 6.4 x 2.9 x 0.35 inches (163 x 74.7 x 8.95 mm), the OnePlus Nord N10 5G is a little bit taller, wider and thicker than the OnePlus Nord. It's also a quarter of an ounce heavier at 6.7 ounces (190 grams).OnePlus has fitted the Nord N10 5G with a 6.49-inch LCD display that runs interrupted from top to bottom with only a camera cutout in the upper left corner to interrupt your view. There's a noticeable bezel on the bottom of the screen, but otherwise, the front of the phone is all screen.One area where the OnePlus Nord N10 5G stands out from the competition is its refresh rate. Like the original Nord, this new model refreshes at 90Hz. That's a feature Google reserves for the Pixel 5, so scrolling is much smoother on the OnePlus phones than it is on the Pixel 4a 5G.The lack of an OLED display makes for some less vivid colors when you're watching videos on the Nord N10 5G. Watching the No Time to Die trailer via YouTube, Daniel Craig's James Bond never really stood out from the shadows, making the darker scenes a little bit more murky. At least the Nord N10 5G handles color well, as it managed to capture 124.8% of the sRGB color spectrum. That's about what the OLED panel on the Pixel 4a 5G reproduced (128.3%) and it's ahead of the 111.2% and 105.1% turned in by the iPhone SE and TCL 10 5G UW, respectively, which both have LCD screens. The OnePlus N10 5G falls between those phones when it comes to accurately rendering colors with a Delta-E rating of 0.22. The iPhone SE was tops at 0.2 while the TCL 10 5G and Pixel 4a 5G trailed at 0.28 and 0.3, respectively. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)I found the Nord N10 5G's screen a little hard to see when I was outside, and the phone's maximum brightness of 405.7 nits is likely to blame. That's well behind the Pixel 4a 5G (638 nits), iPhone SE (653 nits) and OnePlus Nord (700 nits). Only TCL's phone is dimmer at 385 nits.Inexpensive as the OnePlus Nord N10 5G may be, you still get a four-camera array on the back of the phone. Unfortunately, one of those lenses isn't a telephoto one. Instead, OnePlus gives you a 64MP main camera with an 8MP ultrawide angle lens. Dedicated macro and monochrome lenses round out the optics.One the camera front, OnePlus phones have the reputation of offering good but not great imaging — decent enough for what you're paying, but not anything that challenges the best camera phones on the market. To see if that holds up with the Nord N10 5G, I tried out OnePlus' latest handset alongside a Pixel 4a 5G, which produces some of the best photos I've seen in a sub-$500 phone. OnePlus holds its own in many cases, but it still can't quite catch the top camera phones.Take this photo of a persimmon tree. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G washes out some of the fall colors; you can see just how dramatically when you contrast it with the Pixel's shot. The reddening leaves aren't as dramatic as they are in the Pixel 4a 5G photo, and even the orange skin of the persimmons looks muted and dull in OnePlus' photo.The same thing happens when we move indoors and take a picture of some baked sole fresh out of the oven. The fish looks pretty white in the OnePlus Nord N10's photo, missing the light brown sear that the Pixel manages to capture. The green onions I've added for garnish are pretty washed out in the Nord's photo, and the capers dotting the fish on the tray in the background lack sharpness and definition. I know which plate I find more appetizing, and it's not the OnePlus rendition.I was impressed by the ultra wideangle lens on the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, though, when I tested it by photographing a local church with two distinctive towers. Using the main camera, the OnePlus N10 5G produced a shot that looks every bit as good as what the Pixel 4a comes up with. The sky is a perfect shade of blue, and if you zoom in on the tree leaves, you'll find that the OnePlus camera does a better job of keeping them in focus. Text on both the traffic signs and the church marquees is perfectly legible in both shots.Pulling out to a wider angle with both cameras, I prefer the OnePlus Nord N10's effort. The darker shades of blue in the sky closest to the clouds draws my attention to where it should be in the photo — at the clouds radiating behind the church's twin towers. That said, the fish-eye effect at the edge of the photo is less noticeable in the Pixel 4a 5G's rendition.UWhen it came time to test the night mode, the OnePlus Nord N10 5G simply doesn't measure up to what Google brings to its Pixel phones. My daughter's pink stuffed animal is visible in this low-light shot captured by the OnePlus camera, but it's hard to make out the other stuffies that are clearly visible in the Pixel 4a 5G photo. What's more, you can also see the basketball to the right of the stuffed animals in the Pixel's shot. That ball fades into the blackness of the OnePlus night mode photo.Similarly, it's no contest when it comes to the portrait mode on either camera, starting with the different approaches OnePlus and Google take to framing their shot. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G shows a lot of the background, adding a minimal blur that helps my daughter to stand out but doesn't really add anything artistic to the mix. The camera's software does a good job recognizing where she ends and the background begins, but it also keeps her face rather pale and smooth, so that you can't really see her freckles. That's not an issue on the Pixel 4a 5G portrait, which cuts in closer and bathes my daughter in warmer colors. That not only highlights the redness of her hair but the details of her face.Maybe the OnePlus Nord N10 5G just has a problem with skin tones because the 16-megapixel front camera struggles with sunlight and shadow in this self-portrait. The entire left side of my face is lost in shadow, a problem that the Pixel 4a 5G didn't suffer even though it had to contend with similar lighting. The glare on the right side of my face in the OnePlus shot is also pretty harsh when compared against the Pixel 4a 5G's selfie. Google's software gets overly aggressive with face smoothing in its photos, but here it pays off with a better balanced shot.As for the other cameras on the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, I confess to remaining skeptical of what dedicated macro lenses bring to the table, and this up-close shot of some hard-boiled eggs flaked with pepper show why. There's nothing particularly wrong with the OnePlus shot. It makes the pepper flakes stand out and you can see the creaminess of the yolk (just the way I like my eggs). But you can also see those same details I shot with the Pixel 4a 5G, which doesn't have a macro lens. Instead, I got Google's phone as close to the eggs as possible before an on-screen warning flashed up that I needed to back up if I wanted something in focus. I don't think the end result is all that different, which makes me wonder why there's a macro lens other than to pump up the camera count.The monochrome photos taken by the Nord N10 5G are certainly decent — the details of this Victorian house still stand out even in black and white — but I can't imagine making this camera a regular part of my shooting routine. Plenty of photography buffs will tell you that a dedicated lens will produce better shots than a simple filter, and they're certainly, right, especially when it comes to accurately reflecting things like shadows. But having a dedicated monochrome lens seems like adding a camera just so you can say that you have X number of lenses. As Google has proven time and again with its Pixel phones, less is often more, especially when you can nail the software.One of the most eye-catching changes between the OnePlus Nord and OnePlus Nord N10 5G is the step down from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G to the Snapdragon 690, one of the first chipsets from Qualcomm's 6 series to feature 5G connectivity. It's also a piece of silicon aimed more squarely at phones in the lower midrange of the market.When it comes to both benchmarks and real-world use, though, the change in processors doesn't make that much of a difference. On Geekbench 5, which measures general performance, the OnePlus Nord N10 5G posted a single-core score of 606 and a multicore result of 1,843. That actually beat the 602 single-core number posted by the original Nord, though that phone's 1,984 multicore score would suggest that the more expensive Nord is better suited for apps that take advantage of multiple cores.As you might expect, the iPhone SE, with its superior A13 Bionic chip, dusts the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, with single- and multicore scores of 1,337 and 3,226, respectively. But the N10 actually tops the Snapdragon 765G-powered Pixel 4a 5G, which posted scores of 598 and 1,614 in Geekbench. The Nord N10 5G trails the 1,932 multicore scored posted by the TCL 10 5G UW and its Snapdragon 765 chipset.It's a different story in graphics, where the OnePlus Nord N10 5G lags behind the competition. Using 3DMark's new Wild Life benchmark, we saw a score of 809 (4.8 frames per second) for the N10 5G. That's behind the score of the Pixel 4a 5G (1,199 or 7FPS), which is not exactly a graphics powerhouse; TCL's 5G phone posted a 1,670 (10FPS) result The OnePlus Nord N10 5G also trailed similar phones when it came to 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme benchmark, too.Ultimately, though, this doesn't translate to noticeable performance lags when you use the OnePlus Nord N10 5G. Yes, I've seen sharper graphics when running PUBG Mobile on other phones, particularly those with beefier graphics support. But the multiperson shooter game runs without any hiccups on the new OnePlus phone — certainly nothing that would impact game play. I imagine that unless you're in the habit of running graphically-demanding games on your mobile device, the OnePlus Nord N10 5G will suit you just fine.As noted above, the OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers 5G compatibility and at a price that's much lower than other phones like the $499 Pixel 4a 5G and $399 TCL 10 5G UW. But there's a caveat to the Nord N10's 5G support. The embedded X51 modem on the Snapdragon 690 chipset doesn't work with high-speed mmWave-based 5G networks. That means the OnePlus Nord N10 will only connect to sub-6GHz 5G networks, which are only marginally faster than LTE at this time. That's likely to improve as wireless carriers build out their 5G coverage, but if you opt for the latest OnePlus Nord, don't expect speeds that reach 1 Gbps. For that, you'd need a phone like the TCL 10 5G that's built to work with Verizon's high-speed 5G towers.OnePlus also tells me that the N10 5G only works on LTE at AT&T and not with that carrier's 5G network, so in essence, you should only consider the OnePlus Nord N10 5G if you're planning on getting wireless service from T-Mobile or a discount carrier that uses T-Mobile's towers.OnePlus may have dialed back the processor on the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, but it hasn't sacrificed battery life for the phone. The latest Nord features a 4,300 mAh battery, which helped power it one of the best results on our battery test that we've seen from a 5G phone.In our battery test, we have a phone surf the web over cellular — T-Mobile's 5G network in this case — with its screen set to 150 nits of brightness until it's out of power. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G held out for 11 hours and 48 minutes on that test. Among the 5G phones on our best phone battery life list, only the LG V60 ThinQ 5G, Motorola Edge, and Galaxy S20 Plus lasted longer (and that latter phone's result was with its 120Hz refresh rate turned off). All those phones are far more expensive than what OnePlus charges for the Nord N10.As for phones in the Nord N10 5G's expected price range, the OnePlus device handily out-performed them. The iPhone SE lasted a little more than 9 hours on our battery test, while the Pixel 4a 5G ran out of battery just past the 8 hour mark.The OnePlus Nord N10 5G charges quickly, too, thanks to OnePlus' Warp Charge 30T technology. That's not as fast as what OnePlus 8T owners experience, but it's still plenty speedy for a lower cost phone. Our N10 5G was back up to 68% of its battery capacity after 30 minutes of charging, the same result we got when we tested the OnePlus Nord. The Pixel 4a 5G and iPhone SE only got to 46% and 29% charges, respectively.Like all OnePlus phones, the Nord N10 5G uses the company's OxygenOS software which is built on top of Android. In the case of the Nord N10 5G, that's Android 10.5 — an interesting decision when the OnePlus 8T was among the first Android phones outside of Google's own devices to ship with the newer Android 11 installed. That's the price you pay for going with a cheaper model, I guess, but it means new features found in Android 11 aren't available here.It gets worse — after this review was published, OnePlus confirmed to Android Central that Android 11 will be the only guaranteed update for the Nord N10, other than two years of security updates. OnePlus says that upgrade plan ""aligns with industry standards for smartphones in more affordable price ranges,"" but that's not something you want to see phone makers emulate — particularly when they've previously positioned themselves as a fan-focused company.You also don't get an in-display sensor like you'd find on pricier OnePlus handsets, a trade-off I suspect bargain hunters won't find. It helps that OnePlus placed its sensor in an easy-to-reach area, and that the sensor proved pretty responsive in my testing. I wasn't sure what to expect when I started my OnePlus Nord N10 5G review, as some of the stripped-down specs from the OnePlus Nord made me worry that U.S. users would be missing out on the value that the original Nord had brought to other parts of the world. As it turned out, I needn't have fretted. The trade-offs you make with the N10 5G may be slightly more pronounced than they are with the standard Nord, but this is still a very capable phone for what OnePlus is ultimately charging U.S. customers. If you've been intrigued by 5G but put off by the high price of 5G phones, the N10 5G may be what pushes you to upgrade.It's undeniable that the cameras are better on Google's Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5a models, and that the iPhone SE offers a more compact design along with the whole iOS experience. But the main and ultrawide angle cameras on the OnePlus Nord N10 aren't bad (even if the macro and monochrome lenses feel superfluous) and the gap in performance from other midrange Android devices isn't that substantial.Far more noticeable than what you give up is what the Nord N10 5G delivers — a fast-refresh screen, long battery life, fast charging and 5G performance at a lower price than you'd otherwise pay for such welcome capabilities."

And while there aren't many competitors to compare it to right now, ZTE looks to have set the standard for under-screen sensors for the time being.Once you look past the disappearing selfie camera, the phone that remains is still an impressive one. Sitting at the more expensive side of mid-range phones, the Axon 30 boasts a huge display, a strong chipset and rapid charging. But the rougher sides of the Axon 30 experience — its undersized battery, divisive design and disappointing photos — should give you pause if you're thinking about a purchase.This ZTE Axon 30 5G review will explain why you may not want to give into temptation with this phone. Yes, its invisible camera is a visually impressive feature and can be yours for a fraction of the price of a phone like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. However if you want more than a fancy front camera, you may find your needs are better catered to by other excellent phones in this price range.You can buy your own Axon 30 5G from September 9, with prices starting at $499/£429 for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage version, and RISING to £519 for the 12GB/256GB edition. You can buy the phone directly from ZTE, or from Amazon once sales go live.At this price, the Axon 30 5G is a touch too expensive to be one of our best cheap phones. However it is still a legitimate competitor for the Google Pixel 5a (or Pixel 4a 5G for U.K. readers), the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G or the more expensive 12GB/256GB variant of the OnePlus Nord 2.Staring at the ZTE Axon 30’s 6.9-inch display, you'll struggle to find a bigger screen on a phone this year, especially at the price. You'll also struggle to find the front camera, since this phone's most prominent feature is somewhat ironically its disappearing under-display camera, which makes the front of the phone an elegant uninterrupted sheet of flat glass. Only Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 also sports such a feature at this point, and it’s more than three times the cost of Samsung’s foldable.Turning the phone over reveals a messy set of design elements on the ZTE Axon 30’s curved back. You have a choice of either black or aqua colors, which are by themselves fairly classy, glossy hues. However ZTE added a pearlescent effect, as well as the phone's name and a diagonal texture beneath the glass, which is too much for my liking. And it only gets worse after you've been holding the phone for a little bit, as that gloss finish insists on picking up every fingerprint and speck of dust it's exposed to.Also contributing to this visual clutter is the Axon 30’s camera block. The circles-within-circles design looks different from most other Android phone camera bumps, but also features a weird mix of textures. It approaches the level of visual distraction you'd find on gaming phones, although ZTE fortunately stopped short of adding RGB lighting.Let's address the signature feature of the ZTE Axon 30 5G before anything else. Beneath a small rectangle of pixels in the top center of the display sits a 16MP camera. As this is ZTE's second attempt at this type of camera (the first being last year's ZTE Axon 20 5G), there have been quite a few improvements, including new transparent display materials, larger sensor pixels, a higher pixel density in the display and improved photography algorithms. But how good are the pictures this camera produces? ZTE is being realistic, warning you not to expect  photos up to the standard of conventional selfie cameras. That said, the images produced by the Axon 30’s UDC are much better than last year's Axon handset, and should be much better than the tiny 4MP camera under the display of the Galaxy Z Fold 3. Stay tuned for a more detailed comparison between these two cameras.For now, I compared the selfie cam on the ZTE Axon 30 to the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G, a similarly priced phone from a much bigger competitor. The clarity of the ZTE image seems minimally affected, although in bright light, you start getting strange defects in the ZTE's image. It comes in the form of lost definition between the leaves in the background, but this can also take the form of distracting halos of light with more focussed light sources.I wouldn't use the Axon 30’s front camera to take myself a long-overdue new profile picture for my social media accounts, but this sub-screen sensor works fine if you merely want serviceable selfies or need to make a video call.Let's move to the screen which that under-display camera is beneath. As we've mentioned, the ZTE AXon 30 5G offers a 6.9-inch panel — one of the largest you can buy right now. It's also got a 120Hz refresh rate and an FHD+ resolution, meaning the panel matches the stats of much more expensive phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S21, while still being larger. I watched the trailer for Star Wars: Visions on both the ZTE Axon 30 and the Galaxy A52, and found that ZTE’s phone offers a more immersive experience, though the colors and strokes of the anime art-style come off better on the Samsung phone. The action seems sharper and the colors more vivid on the A52’s smaller display.Fortunately the ZTE isn't let down by the display covering the front camera. You can notice the camera's rectangular recess most easily at an extreme angle and with an all-white background, but this isn't how you're going to normally use the phone. When you’re watching video or concentrating on the task at hand, the hidden lens is even more difficult to notice.The rest of the cameras on the ZTE Axon 30 5G aren’t nearly as big a deal as the under-display camera, but you do get four rear sensors. Sadly these are not all equally useful, but they do match up well to rival camera systems.The quartet of Axon 30 sensors consists of a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultrawide camera and a 5MP macro camera, backed up with a 2MP depth sensor. To try the Axon 30’s cameras out, I tested them against the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G.The main cameras on both the ZTE and Samsung phones feature 64MP sensors, so it's perhaps unsurprising to see two similar shots of the Merchant Square Fan Bridge's signature counterweights. The grey of the painted metal looks deeper in the Samsung's image, which is as expected since highly saturated photos are a signature Samsung trait. It doesn't draw me any more to the Samsung's photo than the ZTE's though.The two images in this ultrawide comparison look quite different because the two phones use slightly differing magnification. Ignoring how the lines of Paddington Station's roof don't quite match, this is a shot where I think the Axon 30 finally has an edge over the Samsung device. The Axon's image looks bright and natural, whereas the A52 has given the scene a strange green-yellow tinge.I tried out a portrait shot of this statue to see how the depth sensors on both phones produce a bokeh effect. The Galaxy A52 5G is my favourite here, since it has a deeper blur and it brings out the colors in the metal of the statue much better than the Axon 30 manages.Macro cameras on cheaper smartphone often produce dire quality images, but these two haven't turned out too badly. Picking a winner is hard though. The A52’s image has a better depth of field, keeping more of this red flower in focus. However the image's colors are overly saturated, while the Axon 30’s algorithm has kept the intensity of the colors in better balance.The ZTE Axon 30 5G uses a Snapdragon 870 system-on-chip, a decently powerful chip for a phone at this price. This is accompanied by either 8GB of RAM in the base version or 12GB if you pay for the fancier version.We ran the 8GB RAM Axon 30 through our usual battery of benchmarks, and found these specs resulted in surprisingly potent results. On the general performance Geekbench 5 test, the ZTE's results were a 976 on the single core test and a 3,150 on the multi-core test. Compared to the 786 and 2,757 scores of the OnePlus Nord 2, powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI chip, and 637 and 1,866 of the Snapdragon 750G-backed Galaxy A52, the Axon 30 is far more powerful. ZTE’s phone still loses out to the 1,337 and 3,226 of the iPhone SE and its A13 Bionic chip, even though that chip is almost two years old.Moving to 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited graphics benchmark, the Axon 30 scored 4,230 points for an average framerate of 25.3 fps. That’s slightly better than the Nord 2's 4,185 and 25.1 fps, but still nowhere close to the iPhone SE's results of 8,000 and 47.9 fps. But if you're determined to stick to Android, it's hard to find more power for the price of the Axon 30.I played a few rounds of Crash On The Run, which turned out to be a great experience on such a large and well-powered phone. Crash Bandicoot himself, the environment and the hazards all looked detailed and ran smoothly and responsively, thanks to the display's high refresh rate and touch sampling rate.5G comes built in with the Axon 30's Snapdragon 870 chipset. The bad news is that it's the sub-6GHz flavor of 5G, which is more commonly supported but isn't as fast as the mmWave version used by mobile carriers like Verizon.Having checked the available 5G bands on the Axon 30's NA model, it should work with T-Mobile and Verizon’s slower 5G bands. U.K. buyers needn't worry since all available 5G networks should be supported.Despite the size of the ZTE Axon 30 5G, it only contains a 4,200 mAh battery. Comparably-sized phones, like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, can have closer to 5,000 mAh of capacity, so it's a noticeable deficit. The new phone’s power pack is even slightly smaller than the Axon 20's battery, if only by 20mAh.On my unofficial rundown test, playing a calming 10-hour aquarium video on YouTube at medium brightness and volume with the phone set to its maximum 120Hz refresh rate, it took 6 hours and 21 minutes for the battery to drop 50%. That's just a touch shorter than the OnePlus Nord 2 I tested recently (which lasted 6 hours and 33 minutes on the same test). Hopefully, it means you can easily get a day of intensive use out of the Axon 30 before needing to recharge it.Somehow this annoys me more than if the Axon 30 had lasted for a shorter time. I don't know exactly why ZTE didn't fit a larger battery in the Axon 30, but I'd wager if it did, it would easily make it onto our best phone battery life list. Instead, this feels like wasted potential.ZTE's been generous with the charging speed, though. You still get a charger in the box, something you actually have to confirm these days thanks to Apple and Samsung's influence. The charger you get is a powerful one too, offering 65W charging just like the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro. The results of our charging test were a drained Axon 30 filling up to 49% in 15 minutes, 78% in 30 minutes and to 100% in 47 minutes. That's actually slower than the OnePlus Nord 2, despite the OnePlus phone featuring a slightly bigger 4,500 mAh battery. While filling your phone completely in under 50 minutes is not to be sniffed at, ZTE seems to need to put a bit more work into its charging tech if it wants to catch up with the best.Aside from the under-display camera, the software running on the ZTE Axon 30 5G is perhaps the most improved aspect of the phone since last year’s model. ZTE is using its revised MyOS Android skin, based on Android 11. It's far more pleasant to use than MiFavor, ZTE’s previous software which came on the Axon 20.However, not much has really changed from the last time I tried a ZTE phone, the ZTE Axon 30 Ultra. The interface is clearly designed and looks welcoming with a focus on rounded-off menu elements and pastel colors. But ZTE still needs to do another pass over its Settings menu descriptions, where the descriptions read clumsily and may annoy users who aren't too familiar with the features being described.The ZTE Axon 30 5G is uniquely exciting because of its futuristic under-display camera and the phone’s unexpectedly good specs, combined with a fairly low price. Still, it's tricky to actually recommend the phone as a practical purchase.You may want to go for the Axon 30 5G because of the large display and great performance, which makes it an excellent option for games. The phone’s charging and battery life do well also, but are not the best you can get for the money. The photography is about passable, but it isn't any better than its rivals, particularly when it comes to selfie quality.The Axon 30 is a much better phone than the Axon 20 was, but unfortunately the competition has moved forward, too, as you can see with comparable phones from OnePlus and Samsung. At least the Axon 30 can still lay claim to having the best under-display camera on the market, especially when it costs about a third of the price of the other phone with the same feature."
34,Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-s20-ultra,"Is it still worth buying the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra? It's been over 18 months since the phone launched, at which point it's been passed by the Galaxy Note 20, as well as the S-Pen toting Galaxy S21 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 3.The answer is still a resounding yes. Not only is the S20 Ultra a perfectly capable and powerful phone, time has only lowered its once-hefty price tag. It may not have S Pen support, a folding screen, or even a dual 3x and 10x telephoto camera lenses, but what this phone does have means it's still a very appealing choice.Samsung packed what was the most advanced camera at the time into the Galaxy S20 Ultra: a quad-lens module that includes a 108-megapixel main sensor, and 10x lossless zoom that offers up to 100x in digital power.One quick look at those top-flight optics and sensors, and you'd assume the Galaxy S20 Ultra was destined to be the best camera phone on the market. But thanks to a number of frustrating bugs at launch, the photos we initially took weren't anywhere near as impressive as you'd hope. Especially given the original price.Fortunately, the S20 Ultra is so much more than just a camera, with its gargantuan 6.9-inch, 120Hz display and future-proof support for every major carrier’s 5G network. And if nearly 7 inches of screen real estate is more than you need, Samsung offers alternative options: there's the slightly more compact 6.7-inch Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus or the even smaller and cheaper 6.2-inch Samsung Galaxy S20 — though those models lose the Ultra’s powerful zoom.Just about everything is supersized about the Galaxy S20 Ultra. That makes it one of the best high-end phones out there, though the newer Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra  and Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra incorporate many of the S20 Ultra's features — like that 108-MP camera — to better effect.The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra launched with an eye-watering $1,399 price tag, though thankfully that price has not stuck around The starting configuration includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but you can upgrade to a 16GB/512GB model for a bit more money if you need more memory and capacity. Thankfully the launch of the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which starts at $1,199, means the price has been dropping quite a bit. Shop around and you can easily find a brand new S20 Ultra for less than $1,000. Expect that to decrease even more as time goes on. The Galaxy S20 Ultra is available through all major U.S. carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. If you're looking to snap up an S20 Ultra and save, be sure to check out our guide to the best Galaxy S20 deals. Some retailers and carriers are offering goodies, such as gift cards and additional credit toward a new S20 when you trade in your current smartphone.In some ways, the Galaxy S20 Ultra looks a lot like Samsung phones that have preceded it — namely, the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10. The edges are curved, the display goes right up to the edge of the device and nearly kisses the metal frame, and there’s an Infinity-O hole punch camera cutout up top, smack dab in the center.But the S20 Ultra in particular is like a Galaxy flagship on steroids. To the point where the phones that followed many of its design features. Features like the massive display, stretching 6.9 inches from corner to corner, and the giant rectangular camera array on the rear dominates the back of the device, aggressively protruding from an otherwise unremarkable slab of gray glass.Sadly the S20 Ultra only comes in two extremely boring shades — Cosmic Black and Cosmic Gray — that are underwhelming considering how much this phone has going on under the hood. Samsung does offer Cloud Blue and Cloud Pink versions of the less expensive Galaxy S20 variants, though those hues are absent for Ultra customers. And no matter which shade you buy, this phone is also a serious magnet for fingerprints; perhaps Samsung should have offered a matte glass option, too. The one aspect of the S20 Ultra’s design we haven’t yet touched upon is size, and make no mistake — this is one beast of a smartphone. It measures 6.6 x 2.9 x 0.34 inches and weighs 7.7 ounces, making it much taller and a smidge thicker than the iPhone 11 Pro Max, but a hair narrower.To Samsung’s credit, though, it was able to keep the S20 Ultra lighter than 7.97-ounce iPhone 11 Pro Max, even though the iPhone has a significantly smaller battery and a more compact camera module. Regardless, if you prefer your smartphones smaller, the S20 Ultra is certainly not for you. The Galaxy S20 Ultra’s camera system has a lot going for it, including a 108MP sensor that captures highly detailed images, a 10x lossless zoom and up to a 100x digital Space Zoom. Plus, every sensor is larger, which helps pull in more light. That all sounds good, but there's one big problem: The S20 Ultra has some issues focusing. For example, when trying to hone in on a miniature arcade machine up close, the S20 Ultra definitely takes longer to get its bearings than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The Samsung handset's focus was jumpy, while the iPhone’s was almost instantaneous and smooth.The S20 Ultra also exhibited jumpy autofocus when shooting video in Bryant Park. As my colleague Mike Prospero moved around the frame, the S20 Ultra demonstrates obvious trouble keeping up; both he and the background shift in and out of focus. Meanwhile, the iPhone 11 Pro Max kept him and the rest of the scene in perfect clarity. In the days following the S20 Ultra's launch, Samsung provided the following statement surrounding the camera glitches many reviewers have reported:“The Galaxy S20 features a groundbreaking, advanced camera system. We are constantly working to update software to provide with the best camera experience for consumers. The rollout is beginning in Korea and will arrive in additional regions over the next few weeks.”That update is out now, and looks to have squashed some of the jumpiness that was unavoidable upon the phone's initial release. Overall, the S20 Ultra truly shines when capturing zoom shots from a distance, but in other scenarios — like at night, or when capturing a shallow depth-of-field Live Focus portrait — the results can be mixed.The good news is that the 108MP camera can capture a stunning amount of detail under the right conditions. In this shot of the curved Grace building, we could crop around the letters on the facade and still make them out clearly. Low light photography, however, is more of a challenge for the S20 Ultra. The iPhone 11 Pro’s shot in this particular face-off is noticeably more detailed than the one captured using Samsung's flagship. The texture in the yellow petals is much clearer in the result from Apple's handset.But then, in other circumstances, the Night Mode shots produced by the Galaxy S20 Ultra compare more favorably to those we took with the iPhone 11 Pro Max. This photo of a tree at night taken with the S20 Ultra is highly detailed and well lit, though there is a slight yellowish cast to the shot. The iPhone 11 Pro Max’s version is much darker and some details, like the bark, don’t stand out as clearly.Another complaint about the S20 Ultra’s camera is that it aggressively smooths out faces. We took a couple of portrait photos of Mike again, and the S20 Ultra’s image was in focus this time, but still lacking precision. You can especially tell around Mike’s eyes and the right side of his face, which gets blown out by the sunlight. The S20 Ultra’s shot features better contrast, but overall it loses to the iPhone 11 Pro Max here.The issues we’ve noticed with the S20 Ultra’s camera are especially frustrating, given how the camera performed in most of our other head-to-head tests, particularly when we utilized the other lenses on the device. Samsung’s high-end phone benefits from a 4x optical, 48MP telephoto lens capable of 10x lossless zoom and up to 100x digital zoom. That’s some serious power, and Samsung has an appropriately bombastic name for it: Space Zoom.We tested the S20 Ultra’s 10x hybrid zoom — which employs software on top of the lens' natural 4x optical power — by snapping a photo of Manhattan’s iconic Chrysler Building from the corner of West 42 St. and 5th Ave., which is about three blocks away. We then captured the same picture from the same vantage point with the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which has only a 2x optical zoom telephoto lens, and none of the post-processing that Samsung uses to clean up digital zoom on the S20 Ultra.The difference, as you can plainly see, is night and day — like the difference between an impressionistic painting and an actual photograph. The S20 Ultra’s rendition is exponentially more detailed, and it’s amazing when you consider it was produced by a smartphone.Zooming in on the carvings adorning the facade of the New York Public Library, the S20 Ultra’s mix of sophisticated hardware and software delivered a precise image of two figures and adjacent text. The iPhone 11 Pro Max’s attempt is also extremely grainy and too warm, with a greenish, sepia-like cast that wasn’t true to the day’s actual conditions.Inside Grand Central Station, the S20 Ultra captured this dim yet once again much clearer shot of the transit hub’s iconic gold clock on top of the information booth. Apple’s device more aggressively exposed the rest of the scene, rather than the clock alone, though the iPhone’s shot is blown out as a consequence in many places. The S20 Ultra’s attempt is conversely a little too dark, but at least it’s crisp enough that it still gives you something to work with in editing.That said, you won’t really want to test the limits of the S20 Ultra’s full 100x digital zoom. For one, it’s really hard to shoot at that kind of power. Any natural hand movements are amplified to the point where it’s nigh impossible to take a perfectly clear and straight picture without noticeable shake. Make no mistake — this is truly tripod territory.Secondly, even the best results with 100x zoom on the S20 Ultra are remarkably blurry, and all the computational photography hacks in the world won't help 100x digital zoom from a 4x optical lens look remotely presentable. Anything up to about 30x proves to be the S20 Ultra’s sweet spot, but you won’t want to push your luck much further beyond that. Previous Galaxy S flagships were always weakest when capturing Live Focus shallow depth-of-field portraits. However, even with some of the weaknesses noted above, the S20 Ultra has improved in that regard. Apple can still claim the portrait crown, but some of our portrait comparisons put Samsung in a better light.The S20 Ultra manages to avoid the hazy warmth of the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s version of this scene, though it also doesn’t do quite as nice a job of exposing the darker regions of the frame and the details within, like the texture of my jacket and scarf. Still, I’d argue the S20 Ultra captured the more realistic photo here, even if it’s not necessarily the best — and that’s a massive step up from portrait mode in Samsung’s prior phones.Personally, the S20 Ultra impressed me the most when I snapped a pic of one of Grand Central’s ornate chandeliers at 5x zoom. Not only is it generally sharper than the iPhone’s version of the same scene, but the lightbulbs are better isolated, and the way the gold portions catch and manipulate light is rendered with remarkable clarity and contrast by Samsung’s camera.Even the S20 Ultra’s ultrawide lens — often the weak link of mobile cameras — churns out good results, delivering an eye-catching shot of Brooklyn’s underground DeKalb market in challenging lighting conditions. The iPhone 11 Pro Max delivered a comparatively softer and warmer take, that slightly blew out the neon signs and didn’t paint the edges of objects and text quite as crisply.As noted, you have to force the S20 Ultra's main camera to shoot at 108MP. What you're then often left with is an ultra-high resolution photo that looks pretty flat, and likely not as good as if you just left the camera alone to begin with. I’m more impressed with the saturated yellows and pinks that the S20 Ultra pulled out of the flowers you see above, but the Pixel 4 clearly wins where contrast is concerned, as it better separated the petals.Finally, we turn to the S20 Ultra’s 40MP front-facing shooter, which — like the main 108MP camera — also uses pixel binning. The selfie you see here actually only weighs in at 6.5MP, though it you wouldn’t know it. The iPhone 11 Pro Max’s portrait is clearly a little sharper, owing to Apple’s Deep Fusion processing technique, which is designed to extract exceptional detail in medium-light conditions.I like how much brighter Apple’s take is, and you can especially notice the improved detail in the fabric of my sweater and my skin tone. But I don’t appreciate how pulled back the iPhone’s perspective is compared to the S20 Ultra’s, and once again, Samsung’s white balance is more neutral and not as artificially warm.The most standout camera feature on the S20 Ultra (aside from all those megapixels and the crazy zoom) is Single Take mode. When engaged, Single Take records a 10-second video and snaps multiple images, giving you an entire gallery of options to choose from and share. The S20 Ultra will pick the best-looking still shot, take a 12MP ultrawide photo, a portrait with Live Focus mode and capture both a sped-up video and a normal-speed clip. I was impressed with the Single Take mode’s results when I recorded a juggler in action with the S20 Ultra. However, Single Take’s appeal is sort of limited, as it’s really only reserved for when you have a unique subject in motion. It’s also very difficult to determine which shots are which from a glance — this mode could really benefit from an update that labels each piece of content so you can better tell them apart by their thumbnails, like “ultrawide,” “best shot,” ""Live Focus” and so on.Last but certainly not least, the S20 Ultra is capable of recording 8K video at 24 fps, and you can turn moments from your clips into 33MP photos. When you’re done shooting, you can cast 8K videos to Samsung QLED TVs or share them with other Samsung devices — though with 4K displays only now becoming commonplace, it’s hard to imagine anyone has the tech necessary to view such content today, and so Samsung’s achievement here rings pretty hollow. And with the autofocus issues that have emerged, this is a feature that requires more fine-tuning.Samsung supplies the displays in a great number of the world’s smartphones, which is why it was so surprising to see the Galaxy S10 fall behind the competition last year when it came to the screen. While other handsets —from the OnePlus 7 Pro to the ROG Phone 2 and Google’s Pixel 4 — boasted 90Hz and 120Hz refresh rates, the S10 offered a pedestrian 60Hz.Fortunately, Samsung is catching up with the Galaxy S20 line. All three S20 models tout 120Hz panels, though the S20 Ultra’s is the largest of the bunch by far, sized at 6.9 inches with a 20:9 aspect ratio and 3400x1440 resolution.Unfortunately, the Galaxy S20 Ultra’s display comes with a rather hefty caveat to running at 120Hz. When it’s in this high-refresh mode, you only get a Full HD resolution, rather than the native QHD resolution. The reason for this appears to be a means to conserve battery life, as the higher the resolution and refresh rate the more power hungry a display is. As such, you’ll need to pick and choose when you want to have: a super smooth display versus a super sharp one. There’s an argument that QHD resolutions aren’t so important on phone displays, but they can make a difference when using a phone with the Galaxy S20’s large screen. It’s also a bit of a bummer as both the OnePlus 8 Pro and the Oppo Find X2 Pro support their QHD resolutions while running at 120Hz. This is facilitated by extra hardware between the phones’ screen and their innards, meaning both handsets are thicker than the Galaxy S20 Ultra’s. So Samsung’s compromise is arguably an acceptable one when it comes to keeping a slim frame in a large phone.   At first, this limitation bothered me. However, in practice, I didn’t notice the resolution hit in typical usage, and I came away so impressed by the heightened refresh rate that I didn’t really care about those missing pixels. I thought the 90Hz panel in the Pixel 4 offered a major step up in terms of responsiveness and ease of use compared to the conventional 60Hz screens of old when I reviewed that device. Likewise, the S20 Ultra’s 120Hz display is even faster and therefore even more refreshing to use. I almost don’t want to get to familiar with it, because I expect it’ll be hard to go back.The only problem with the switch to 120Hz is that almost all games and media aren’t optimized for it. This is something that third-party app developers could address on a case by case basis; Microsoft’s Forza Street racing game will be among the first titles to take advantage of the doubled refresh rate, for example. Additionally, the screen’s speedy 240Hz touch sampling rate should make it ideal for highly-competitive games — particularly shooters like Fortnite. But most of the time, chances are you’ll only feel the difference 120Hz makes when thumbing around the interface.Aside from the refresh rate, the S20 Ultra’s screen looks phenomenal as you’d expect from Samsung, with robust color reproduction, especially at the default Vivid setting. The S20 Ultra covered 231.1% of the sRGB color space according to our light meter, which far exceeds the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s 118.6%. That’s not surprising, given that Apple usually tunes its panels for more subdued, realistic hues — and if you desire the same in the S20 Ultra, you can opt for a Natural color profile in the device’s settings.Watching the trailer for the second season of Netflix’s Formula 1: Drive to Survive, the S20 Ultra rendered the smoke pouring off the rear wheels of a Red Bull grand prix car in slow motion with striking dynamic range and definition.It’s a very impressive screen broadly speaking — though if I had one gripe, it could be a smidge brighter. The S20 Ultra peaks at 662 nits when set to maximum brightness (though it only reaches that peak in extremely bright ambient conditions). That’s a bit dimmer than the iPhone 11 Pro Max at 761 nits, and even Samsung’s cheaper Galaxy Note 10 Plus narrowly bests it, at 686 nits.The roughly 100 nits of additional brightness offered by the iPhone isn’t a hugely significant difference, though it may make contents on the S20 Ultra’s display ever so slightly harder to read outdoors on a sunny day. Plus, it must be said that Apple’s devices can reach their highest possible brightness manually, whereas Samsung’s only reach it in certain circumstances, with the adaptive setting on.While most early 5G phones supported just millimeter wave (mmWave) technology, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is compatible with both mmWave technology and sub-6 GHz bands. The latter gives you a lot more range (though data speeds don't always exceed those of LTE), while mmWave is much faster but requires that you be within line-of-sight of a nearby node.Verizon’s 5G network is built on mmWave and available in more than 30 cities, while T-Mobile and AT&T both offer low-band networks. (T-Mobile’s reaches 5,000 cities, while AT&T is in 20 cities.) Sprint’s midband network delivers slightly faster speeds than T-Mobile and Verizon, but it’s not nearly as fast at Verizon’s 5G network. No matter the network, though, the Galaxy S20 Ultra will work with any carrier’s 5G setup.While our review unit was often connected to T-Mobile's 5G network, we didn't find it to be all that fast in initial testing, as the phone never pulled down more than 4 Mbps in midtown Manhattan. That's obviously very slow, but successive tests in Brooklyn produced download speeds hovering around 100 Mbps over the Uncarrier's sub-6GHz 5G infrastructure. Certainly much more like it — though some advanced LTE networks can deliver those kinds of speeds, too.5G networks are still rolling out across the country, but this feature is a necessity if you plan on holding onto your S20 Ultra for years to come.The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, like all S20 handsets, will be the first phone on the market with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 865 processor, which promises faster performance and reduced power consumption.That CPU gets paired with 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but you can order the S20 Ultra with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $1,599. (Of course, you can also expand the S20 Ultra’s storage with a microSD card, and the phone will support cards up to 1TB in size.)Thus it comes as little surprise that the S20 Ultra was never wanting for more horsepower during our testing. The combination of that 865 silicon and all that RAM means this handset is equipped to handle everything from ordinary multitasking to the most demanding mobile titles, like Fortnite and Asphalt 9 Legends. Fortnite in particular yielded a console-like experience, thanks to the S20 Ultra's massive, super-vivid display, the quality of its graphics and the device's all-around responsiveness.Samsung's new flagship proved strong in benchmarks, too. In Geekbench 5’s multicore system-wide test and GFXBench’s Aztec Ruins high-tier offscreen graphics test, the S20 Ultra delivered scores of 3,076 and 1,319 (20.7 frames per second) respectively. Those compare well with — yet fall just shy of — the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s performance in those tests, where Apple’s flagship delivered scores of 3,517 and 1,657 (25 fps).In our video editing test, where a brief 4K video clip is transcoded to 1080p using Adobe’s Premiere Rush app, the S20 Ultra completed the task in 1 minute and 16 seconds, compared to the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which needed just 45 seconds. It’s fair to say this could have something to do with Adobe possibly better optimizing its app for iOS than Android, though it’s impossible to be certain.One of the S20 Ultra’s handy time-saving features allows users to allocate up to three apps to be stored in RAM so that they launch instantly. And that number goes up to five apps if you opt for the 16GB model.One of our most pressing questions entering this Galaxy S20 Ultra review was how long this phone would last on a charge. Samsung has stuffed the S20 Ultra with a ginormous 5,000 mAh battery, which is the biggest yet in a Galaxy S series device — certainly bigger than the 4,500 mAh battery in last year’s Galaxy S10 5G.But the S20 Ultra is going to need all the power it can handle in order to keep that 120Hz, 6.9-inch display lit up and maintain a speedy 5G data connection around the clock.Tom’s Guide sends every smartphone we review through our custom battery test, where devices are forced to reload a list of webpages indefinitely on T-Mobile’s LTE network until they run out of juice, while set to 150 nits of brightness. For the S20 Ultra, we ran this test four times: twice with the screen set to the standard 60Hz, out-of-the-box setting, and twice at 120Hz. In all instances, the resolution was left at the default full-HD.The difference in runtime due to the refresh rate change was staggering. At 60Hz, the S20 Ultra lasted 12 hours and 13 minutes in its first test, and then 11 hours and 53 minutes in the second. That’s more or less consistent with most other big flagships. To put it in perspective, the iPhone 11 Pro Max lasted 11 hours and 54 minutes in the same test, while the Galaxy Note 10 Plus lasted 11 hours and 9 minutes. Neither of those phones have 5G modems or 120Hz refresh rate options.When we went back and ran the same battery test on the S20 Ultra two more times — now at 120Hz — it lasted exactly 9 hours and 13 minutes in both attempts. That’s about three hours less than its 60Hz performance; so in other words, you’ll be sacrificing about a quarter of the S20 Ultra’s longevity on a charge if you insist on taking advantage of that smoother refresh rate.When it’s time to juice back up, the Galaxy S20 Ultra supports wired 25-watt charging with the stock adapter of the box, as well as Samsung’s 15-watt Fast Wireless Charging 2.0. Owners also have the option of purchasing an even faster 45-watt brick, though the standard 25-watt option seems plenty fast already, judging from our testing. In just a half hour, it took the S20 Ultra from completely dead to 63 percent capacity.All Galaxy S20 phones come with Samsung’s new One UI 2 software, which simplifies the interface to make it easier to jump into your favorite apps, change settings and more. This rides on top of Android 10, which includes new features like Smart Reply and enhanced privacy and notification controls.Samsung is also trying to build better experiences into the S20 line, starting with Google Duo integration. Google’s answer to FaceTime, this video chat app is built right into the phone dialer and contacts apps, and you can video chat with up to 8 people. Plus, you can video chat in full HD for the first time.Other software features include Music Share for sharing out your Bluetooth connection to your car (so you can pass off DJ duties to someone else) and Spotify integration with Bixby routines, so your S20 Ultra will recommend playlists based on contextual cues, like your location and the time of day.Right now the question you may be asking yourself is which Samsung flagship you should be buying. On paper the Galaxy S21 Ultra seems like a clear winner. It has a hybrid zoom with 3x and 10 x optical lenses, support for Samsung's S Pen stylus, the more powerful Snapdragon 888 chipset, plus an extra year of Android and security updates.But that's not to say that the Galaxy S20 Ultra is that bad a phone. It's older, sure, and hasn't picked up all the same upgrades that have been afforded to the galaxy S21 Ultra. That said it still has the same 120Hz QHD+ display, the same 5,000 mAh battery, and a camera that is similar, if not completely identical, and still manages to offer a killer 100x zoom. Plus last year's Snapdragon 865 is no slouch either.It also has a 45W fast charging, compared to the S21 Ultra's 25W, and a microSD card slot — something Samsung decided to pull from the S21 range. That means you don't necessarily need to cough up the cash for bigger storage options.Crucially, the S20 Ultra isn't going to cost you nearly as much as the S21 Ultra does right now. The S21 Ultra may have started off at a much lower price point, but the newer phone is still more expensive than its predecessor. The choice is up to you, but the S20 Ultra is still a strong choice, despite its age, so don't feel you have to get the S21 Ultra if you don't want it.The Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra is an almost a parody of the excesses of smartphone design, from its ginormous 6.9-inch display to its 108MP camera and 100x zoom. It’s the hypercar of flagship handsets, among sports cars.The battery life on the Galaxy S20 Ultra is great, so long as you don’t use the 120Hz screen mode that often. And I’m glad that this phone has 5G to future-proof your investment, provided you can get coverage where you are.However, when you're originally asked to pay $1,399, you deserve a flawless experience. Unfortunately, the camera's inconsistent performance gives us pause. Fortunately, the newer Galaxy S21 Ultra refines many of the S20 Ultra's rough edges for a better all-around experience — and for $200 less than the S20 Ultra cost when new. If you must have the absolute best in mobile tech, we advise looking at the S21 Ultra first.Besides, the overwhelming majority of people will do just fine with the $999 Galaxy S20 or $1,199 Galaxy S20 Plus. Buyers of those phones will get the same fast Snapdragon 865 processor, rich displays and improved — albeit different — imaging stacks, which lacked the S20 Ultra's particular glitches at launch.There's also yet another high-end Samsung handset that arrived not too long ago, in the form of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Fan Edition. The Galaxy S20 FE brought many of the S20 line's most defining features down to an even more reasonable price point, below $999.On top of that the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is now available, and while expensive it offers a more hybrid phone/tablet experience and S Pen support to boot. The Galaxy S21 FE is also set to arrive in the coming weeks, likely offering the best of the Galaxy S21 range for an even lower price than the $1,199 of the original model. In other words the S20 Ultra has a serious amount of competition right nowAll this is to say that while the Galaxy S20 Ultra was indeed very impressive at launch, Samsung's other premium handsets tend to be cheaper with fewer of the S20 Ultra's more frivolous bells and whistles, or of a similar price with more impressive specs and features. Once upon a time, the S20 Ultra was indeed the king, but those times have long since changed."

The partnership with the camera experts has produced a lot of little tweaks, such as the orange shutter button and the unique shutter sound.But the changes introduced to the OnePlus 9 Pro involve more than superficial homages to the company’s new partner. While still just a bit shy of the best camera phones, the OnePlus 9 produces the best photos of any phone OnePlus has ever produced.If you're looking for something more affordable, check out our OnePlus 9 review. But as you'll see in this OnePlus 9 Pro review, there's a lot to love for less money than Samsung's Galaxy S21 Ultra. Both phones go head-to-head for the crown of the best Android phone. Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021. The OnePlus 9 Pro won the award for the fastest charging phone and one highly recommended award.In the US, the OnePlus 9 Pro starts at $969 for the 8GB/128GB base model. For another $100, you can double the storage and get 12GB of RAM. Overall, that’s a $70 increase from the OnePlus 8 Pro, which started at $899. OnePlus has steadily increased its prices year over year, so this is bound to upset longtime fans.Luckily, if you don’t want to drop that much on the Pro model, you can opt for the cheaper OnePlus 9. Starting at $729, you get much of the same phone minus some bells and whistles. OnePlus wanted to go all out with the 9 Pro, and that unfortunately means a higher cost to the consumer.However, $969 costs less than the Galaxy S21 Plus and iPhone 12 Pro, both of which start at $999. For $30 less, you get an equally capable handset, so it’s not a bad deal in the grand scheme of things. OnePlus has built its reputation on offering more phone for less money, but that’s not the company’s sole focus anymore. The flagship killer has joined the ranks it once swore to defeat. At time of writing, only the 12GB/256GB OnePlus 9 Pro is available to pre-order from OnePlus. The 8GB/128GB was officially canceled earlier this year, likely due to the chip shortage that has affected many industries. The OnePlus 9 Pro comes with a 65W charger and a USB-C cable in the iconic red and white. The ludicrous 50W wireless charging stand is sold separately for $69.99.The OnePlus 9 Pro impresses with a gorgeous, eye-catching design. That’s not all that surprising coming from OnePlus, which from the very beginning has created unique phones. From the sandstone back on the OnePlus One and the OnePlus 2 to the red OnePlus 6, this company knows how to make pretty devices that wow when you see them in person.The OnePlus 9 Pro camera module has a lot going on, and it clashes a bit with the minimalism on the rest of the phone’s back. With four lenses, a laser autofocus, LED flash, and a microphone — not to mention the Hasselblad logo — there’s a lot packed into the upper left corner of the phone. The material surrounding all of it has a nice semi-matte look. It certainly doesn’t match the mirror-like finish on the rest of the phone, but it complements the back quite nicely.With the curved display and minimal top and bottom bezels, the OnePlus 9 Pro looks incredible from the front. Though neither the Galaxy S21 Plus nor the iPhone 12 Pro are ugly phones, the OnePlus 9 Pro is one step above them.It comes down to the curved display on the OnePlus device. The curve is subtle and doesn’t hamper usability with accidental touches. With only the hole punch cutout in the top left corner to mar the all-display experience, the 9 Pro looks amazing from all angles.At 6.4 x 2.9 x 0.34 inches, the OnePlus 9 Pro is a big phone. But weighing just 6.9 ounces, it’s also quite light and easy to use. Compare that to the Galaxy S21 Plus’ 7.05 ounces and the iPhone 12 Pro’s dense 6.66 ounces, and the 9 Pro just feels light in my hand. The finish makes the phone very slippery, though, so be careful of the OnePlus 9 Pro falling out of a pocket or slipping from your grip.Tucked into the display is an optical fingerprint sensor and it’s quite good. I only had a few false negatives in my time with the 9 Pro. It’s extremely quick and I can’t tell a difference between it and the ultrasonic reader in the Galaxy S21 Plus. It’s a heck of a lot quicker than Face ID and much more convenient out and about (especially for mobile payments).I have to give OnePlus props for the vibration motor in the 9 Pro. The haptics engine is spectacular — almost on par with the iPhone 12 Pro in my opinion — and makes for a lovely experience tapping, typing, authenticating, and receiving notifications.One confusing thing has been IP certification for the OnePlus 9 Pro. If you buy the phone through T-Mobile, you get IP68. Confirmation on unlocked models remained a mystery, until OnePlus CEO Pete Lau confirmed on Twitter that the 9 Pro is, in fact, IP68.The OnePlus 9 Pro comes in two colors: Morning Mist and Pine Green. I received the Morning Mist model, which has this beautiful mirror-like sheen to it. Head on, you’ll see your face reflected, but look at the phone from an off angle and you’ll notice the finish get darker. Unfortunately, it picks up fingerprints and smudges very easily.If you heard rumors about the quality of the OnePlus 9 Pro’s display leading up to its launch, know that all of that hubbub ended up being true. The OnePlus 9 Pro’s display looks fantastic, both in our lab testing and in my personal use. It’s bright with rich colors, deep blacks, and a smart 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.The 9 Pro scored well in our lab results. In its Natural mode, the phone managed 119.9% of the sRGB spectrum and 84.9% of the taxing DCI-P3 gamut. With a Delta-E score of 0.2 (where 0 is perfect), the OnePlus 9 Pro stands out among the competition.Take the Galaxy S21 Plus, for example. In its natural mode, that device managed 103.8% of the sRGB space and 73.5% of DCI-P3, with a Delta-E of 0.18. The iPhone 12 Pro reproduced 115.6% of the sRGB color gamut and 81.9% of the more demanding DCI-P3 color space, with a 0.24 Delta-E rating that’s not as accurate as the OnePlus 9 Pro’s.Out of the box, the OnePlus 9 Pro display is set to Vivid. At that setting, the 9 Pro reproduced 208.1% and 147.4% of the sRGB and DCI-P3 color gamuts, respectively. Its Delta-E was 0.32. So if you like bright, vivid colors, this mode is for you. That said, I opted for the Natural mode and found it more than punchy enough for my eyes. Everything looks so rich and smooth.I personally find the OnePlus 9 Pro’s display to be more interesting to look at than the Galaxy S21 Plus’ or iPhone 12 Pro’s. It may not be as bright as either at an average of 722 nits (versus 747 on the S21 Plus and 742 on the 12 Pro), but it performs more than adequately outdoors.Another key aspect of the display’s excellent performance is its touch sampling rate. OnePlus calls its super high rate Hyper Touch and claims it sextuples the speed with which the screen communicates with the processor. That gives the OnePlus 9 Pro a very low touch latency, which is key for certain games. At launch, Hyper Touch supports four titles: Brawlstars, League of Legends: Wild Rift, Call of Duty: Mobile, and PUBG Mobile. More will come in time.In practical, day-to-day use, Hyper Touch doesn’t mean much. It shaves off a few milliseconds in the delay between when you touch the screen and the phone responds. Practically every phone nowadays has decently low touch latency, but Hyper Touch is meant to give a slight edge in mobile games.For 2021, OnePlus has put a huge effort into improving its mobile photography. The partnership with Hasselblad is evidence of this. Both companies are focusing initially on producing natural color tones, more akin to what you’d see on a Pixel or iPhone rather than the oversaturated look of a Galaxy device. There are other things about the camera setup that OnePlus wants you to consider, too. Some of these include a lack of edge distortion in ultrawide shots, improvements to the low-light Nightscape mode, and a 3.3x optical and 30x digital zoom on the telephoto lens. That’s all well and good, but how does the OnePlus 9 Pro perform in real-world use?The short answer is very well. The 9 Pro is a marked improvement over past OnePlus phones in terms of photography. The lenses are useful in their own ways (though I find the monochrome one to be the least helpful) and photos come out looking quite good. The main camera is a 48MP Sony IMX789 capable of shooting in 12-bit RAW for advanced photographers and DOL-HDR for rich video. The ultrawide is a 50MP IMX766 sensor with a freeform lens to correct for edge distortion. Finally, there’s the 8MP telephoto. All of this works in tandem with the monochrome sensor and the laser autofocus above the dual-LED flash.To put the OnePlus 9 Pro through its paces, I spent a weekend out photographing and comparing it to other top-tier camera phones in different departments. I mostly challenged the 9 Pro to take on the iPhone 12 Pro and it did really well. For low-light, I put it up against the Pixel 5’s Night Sight and for zoom testing, it went head-to-head with the Galaxy S21 Plus.Starting off, this photo of a produce stand at Whole Foods forced each phone to show off colors the best. Since either device favors softer, more natural colors, there’s hardly a noticeable difference between the two. The OnePlus 9 Pro really brought out the reds, yellows, and greens. Even the teal color of the zucchini baskets looks rich and lively. The iPhone’s shot is a bit brighter, but almost too exposed.In this photo of a small fountain, the pictures once again look strikingly similar. The OnePlus’ image is a bit warmer than the iPhone’s, but it’s still a very close competition between the devices. Which one wins this comparison is down to personal preference — I happen to like the iPhone’s shot a bit more in this scene, but mostly because it’s slightly cooler.This close-up shot of these polka dot plants shows a bit more of a difference between the two. Here, the 9 Pro softened the scene, opting for cooler colors while the iPhone went all out with the pinks and whites. The iPhone’s image is brighter and feels more colorful, even if the OnePlus’ is more true to life. Again, this one boils down to personal preference.Before we leave this plant store, we come to this scene of an anthurium plant. The differences between the OnePlus 9 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro are readily apparent. The OnePlus’ shot is very yellow, as if the temperature got really warmed up. The iPhone’s shot is much cooler and more realistic. The green of the leaves in the background is much richer than what the 9 Pro put out. The iPhone clearly wins here.To test the OnePlus 9 Pro’s ultrawide lens, I took a hike around the shore of Lake Accotink in Virginia. The iPhone’s ultrawide shot feels richer, with deeper colors and more depth. The 9 Pro, meanwhile, feels a bit drab. However, if you look closely at the edges, you can see a tiny bit of distortion on the iPhone’s image. The OnePlus photo doesn’t have this problem.Changing phones for a moment, I pulled out the Galaxy S21 Plus and used it to test zoom, starting with the optical zoom. The 3x on the S21 Plus is just a tiny bit further back, but it’s hardly noticeable. What you can see, however, is that the OnePlus 9 Pro’s shot looks much calmer.Though the sun was out in full force, the S21 Plus’ image looks much brighter. This is a common thing with Samsung phones and it’s almost never realistic. So while both phones do well with zoom, I have to give the OnePlus the victory here simply because of how much more accurate its image is.Testing the max 30x zoom on each phone, neither image is good. However, the S21 Plus has the AI-based Zoom Lock feature to make things steadier. It also has the preview in the top left corner so that you can see where you’re zoomed in. The 9 Pro lacks either of these features.Going back to comparisons against the iPhone, both phones do a remarkable job of capturing my likeness in their respective portrait modes. The background blur radius is nice and artistic, colors are great, and you can tell that I was looking right into the sun. That being said, the iPhone’s shot is brighter and verges on overexposure. The OnePlus wins this comparison.For low-light night modes, I pulled out the Pixel 5. Google’s Night Sight is the best night mode out there, while Nightscape, OnePlus’ night mode, is inconsistent, sometimes failing to even expose properly. In this photo, you can see that the 9 Pro’s image is a bit cooler than the Pixel’s, though it’s more in focus. The bricks look redder in the Pixel’s shot.When it comes to selfies, you can see a difference with the OnePlus 9 Pro. The OnePlus’ image looks washed out, as the phone had trouble accounting for the sun behind me and getting enough details of my face. The iPhone’s shot, meanwhile, looks better with a downplayed tone to the image. The redness of my face and beard stand out more, and the blondeness of my hair is richer. I’d much rather post the iPhone’s selfie than the 9 Pro’s.The Hasselblad partnership also extends to the Pro mode in the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera app if you really want to fine tune your photography experience. Pro mode has options for white balance, ISO, shutter speed, and everything else you’d expect from a manual mode. The 12-bit RAW mode can output 64 times more colors than the traditional 10-bit RAW mode on other devices.The OnePlus 9 Pro also does well with recording video. I tried a couple of times while out on a hike compared with the iPhone 12 Pro. I recorded my walking on the trail with both phones simultaneously at 1080p 60 FPS.The 9 Pro did a great job with stabilization and microphone quality — you could hear me huffing and puffing quite well. The footage was silky smooth and I came away very impressed. OnePlus did an excellent job with the video capabilities of the 9 Pro, including support for 8K 30 FPS and 4K 120 FPS.Beside visual fidelity and frame rate, the OnePlus 9 Pro also supports DOL-HDR, time lapse on the ultrawide camera, portrait video (which works well unless you move too much), focus tracking, and even Nightscape Video for capturing footage in low light. All in all, it’s a robust suite of features for videographers and you’ll be quite pleased with what you can capture.For as long as I can remember, OnePlus has prided itself on providing top-tier smartphone performance for less than its competitors. Even with gaming phones floating around that pack huge batteries, large, high refresh rate screens, ultrasonic shoulder buttons, and high-performance modes that eke out every last bit of power from the processor, the OnePlus 9 Pro measures up well to these tricked-out handsets.The OnePlus 9 Pro packs a Snapdragon 888, currently the best system-on-chip you can get in an Android device, paired with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. I’m confident that you cannot make this phone stutter or slow down. It’s a veritable powerhouse. Whether I was editing documents, messaging on Slack, listening to Spotify, or hopping into a Call of Duty: Mobile match, nothing made the OnePlus 9 Pro slow down. The OnePlus 9 Pro went through the usual suite of benchmarks in our lab. In Geekbench 5, it scored 1,126 in single-core and 3,685 in multicore. For reference, the iPhone 12 Pro manages 1,595 on the single-core test and 3,880 on the multi-core test, so Apple’s A14 Bionic is still the leader of the pack. But compare the OnePlus 9 Pro to most powerful Android phone that we’ve tested to date, the ROG Phone 5, and you’ll see a noteworthy similarity — the ROG Phone scored 1,125 on single-core and 3,672 in multicore, just behind the OnePlus model. In 3DMark’s Wife Life Unlimited graphics test, the OnePlus 9 Pro managed 34.5 frames per second with a score of 5,755. These results put the 9 Pro neck and neck with the ROG Phone 5, which managed 34.8 FPS and a 5,806 score. The iPhone 12 Pro, meanwhile, handily beats both of them both with a 8,619 and 51 FPS. When we spoke to OnePlus, the representatives touched on what the company called OnePlus Cool Play. This is basically a multi-layer cooling system that shifts the heat to the outside frame, making the phone more comfortable to hold when you’re gaming for a long time. While not as advanced as the cooling solutions you find on gaming phones, it’s still pretty impressive and the impact is noticeable.Make no mistake, the OnePlus 9 Pro is a powerful phone. Not only does it almost reach Apple’s crown, but it practically matches the ROG Phone 5. The OnePlus 9 Pro is the most expensive OnePlus device yet, but when it comes down to raw and gaming performance, it leaves nothing to be desired.The OnePlus 9 Pro comes with a 4,500 mAh battery that lasts a respectably long time in my experience. In Tom’s Guide’s battery test, where a device is left to endlessly reload webpages repeatedly on a 5G connection, the 9 Pro averaged 10 hours and 40 minutes with the Smart 120Hz enabled. Surprisingly, switching to the 60Hz mode barely made a difference — it was actually a lower 10 hours and 38 minutes.What could explain this discrepancy? My hypothesis comes down to the LTPO technology. In the 120Hz mode, the OnePlus 9 Pro can go all the way down to 1Hz for static content. The refresh rate will ramp up to 120Hz when it’s needed, such as when you’re scrolling through a web page. But you’ll likely be on the lower end of things a lot of the time.Going for 10 hours and 40 minutes is quite good. Though it’s not quite up to par with the best phone battery life list, it’s still quite nice. The iPhone 12 Pro only managed 9 hours and and 6 minutes in its 5G mode and the Galaxy S21 Plus lasted for 9 hours and 41 minutes. Any phone that lasts longer than 10 hours on 5G with a high refresh rate is impressive in our book.OnePlus and its sister company Oppo have paved the way for incredibly fast charging. For a long time, OnePlus’ Warp Charge (formerly Dash Charge) was the fastest charging you could get in the US, destroying Qualcomm’s Quick Charge in every regard. Nowadays, OnePlus and Oppo have less of a lead in wired charging, but their VOOC technology is great.The 9 Pro uses what OnePlus calls 65T charging. The T means that there is lower internal resistance, which allows the phone to charge at a higher wattage for a longer period of time. You don’t need to be an electrical engineer to understand that the charging speed on this phone is bonkers.But the OnePlus 9 Pro also supports wireless charging, up to a mind-boggling 50W with the OnePlus Wireless Charger. That’s right, the 9 Pro can charge faster wirelessly than the Galaxy S21 Plus and iPhone 12 Pro can charge wired!We tested the 9 Pro’s wired charging prowess — in 15 minutes, the phone went from 0% to 61% and in 30 minutes, it just about fully charged, reaching 99% from 0%. We didn’t test wireless charging times, but OnePlus claims 0% to 70% in 30 minutes and 0% to 100% in 50 minutes.The OnePlus 9 Pro ships with Android 11 out of the box with OxygenOS 11 on top. OnePlus once built a reputation for offering a stock-like Android experience with OxygenOS. I used to call it “stock+” because it looked and felt like Google’s Android vision, but it had added features like gestures, some theming stuff, and other tweaks.With OxygenOS 11, OnePlus started to move away from that. The new software design felt a bit more like Samsung’s One UI, which itself has aimed for a more stock-like feel. Suffice to say, it’s a mess trying to compare OEM skins these days. All that said, I love the OxygenOS experience on the OnePlus 9 Pro.I like how smooth everything feels. I like the theming options, including accent colors and second font option (which I really, really enjoy using). I like the extra features like additional gestures such as double tap to wake or the shortcuts. Moreover, I like the stability and how well the software utilizes the power of the hardware powering it. I was using a press build, so the software will be tweaked slightly for the final release, but I only came across a few things that OnePlus told me would definitely be fixed for the phone’s launch.In the past, OnePlus has liked to be overly aggressive with memory management, but I haven’t noticed this problem with the OnePlus 9 Pro. I received the unit with 12GB of RAM and I never came close to needing that much. However, I never once had an issue with Spotify or YouTube closing in the background like I have with previous OnePlus phones.OxygenOS is elegant in all the right places while putting on a minimalist face. When you first boot up the OnePlus 9 Pro, you’ll find a simplistic, easy-to-use experience. But if you dig around in the settings for the phone and the launcher itself, you’ll find plenty of things to tinker with to make the whole thing feel like it’s your device.The story about the OnePlus 9 Pro and 5G has been confusing at best. Here's how it boils down.It's not a one and done situation with 5G and the OnePlus 9 Pro. Carefully consider the above facts before you make your purchase. For what it's worth, I have not had trouble using a Verizon SIM in our OnePlus 9 Pro review unit.The only thing I have noticed is a lack of Wi-Fi calling at time of writing — it's possible that OnePlus will address this in a software update since my unit uses a press build of OxygenOS.Of course, it's been a few months since the OnePlus 9 Pro has launched. It came to light that OnePlus was messing with throttling app performance, spoofing benchmarks, and that the company would support the phone for longer. All told, the OnePlus 9 Pro is still one of our favorite Android phones, going head-to-head with the powerful Galaxy S21 Ultra.We'd be remiss if we didn't mention phones that have released since then, or are expected to launch very soon. For example, Samsung's new foldable Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3 have launched to much praise. The iPhone 13 is due in just a few weeks and we're even approaching the Google Pixel 6. The OnePlus 9 Pro faces stiff competition in both Android land and the smartphone market at large. OnePlus will have a lot of work to do to make the OnePlus 10 Pro a worthy adversary for the Galaxy Z Fold 3, iPhone 13, and Pixel 6. But for now, it's hard to go wrong with the OnePlus 9 Pro.The OnePlus 9 Pro is one hell of a device and one that I adore using. The OnePlus 9 Pro rejuvenated my love of Android and all that the OS is capable of doing, something that didn’t happen when I tested the Galaxy S21 Plus. OxygenOS is the smoothest Android experience possible. I didn’t once have a problem with apps lagging or delaying to launch, I never saw a single hiccup, and I didn’t have issues with apps closing in the background prematurely. I can’t say the same things for my Pixels. OnePlus has taken OxygenOS to new heights and it’s my favorite iteration of Android right now.If you opt for the OnePlus 9 Pro, you’re getting a very capable camera. While Nightscape might be a bit inconsistent and just plain inferior to the Pixel’s Night Sight or iPhone’s Night Mode, you can still get decent low-light photos. Out in broad daylight, though, the 9 Pro stays extremely close to its camera rivals, if not outright beating them in certain scenarios.Whether you need solid video or competent photography, the OnePlus 9 Pro has you covered. While the iPhone 12 Pro does arguably better with video, I found the 9 Pro to be pretty good, especially for an Android phone.Yes, a $969 starting price is really steep for OnePlus. Long gone are the days where OnePlus’ flagship would cost hundreds less than their counterparts, but I don’t know if that’s really a bad thing. I’m a longtime OnePlus user and fan, and while it’s sad to see the company leave its legacy behind with the 9 Pro, I see why it happened. The 9 Pro is the pinnacle of what the company could accomplish. No holds barred, this phone has all the bells and whistles, and other Android phone makers have a lot of work to do to catch up."
36,Samsung Galaxy A52 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-flagship-features-for-less,"Starting price: $499/£400 Display: 6.5-inch FHD AMOLED (1080 x 2400) Refresh rate: 60Hz/120Hz Chipset: Snapdragon 750G RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB Expandable storage: microSD up to 1Tb Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 5MP macro (f/2.2), 5MP depth sensor (f/2.2) Front camera: 32MP (f/2.2) Operating system: Android 11 with One UI 3.0 Battery: 4,500 mAh Battery life (Hrs: Mins): 12:19 (60Hz), 10:19 (120Hz) Charging: up to 25W wired Size: 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches (159.9 x 75.1 x 8.4mm) Weight: 6.7 ounces (189 grams) Water/dust resistance: IP67The Samsung Galaxy A52 5G offers just enough premium features for little enough money to make users think twice about buying a flagship phone. Priced at $499/£400, it’s designed for the average user who cares mainly about photography, streaming, gaming and battery life. With this phone, you get a 120Hz display, four rear cameras and 5G connectivity in a colorful design — all for less than $500.The Galaxy A52 5G delivers enough flagship-level features that may tempt you to buy this phone rather than the more expensive Samsung Galaxy S21 or Galaxy S20 FE. But as we found during testing for our Samsung Galaxy A52 5G review, this handset isn't as strong as other midrange phones in its price range.The Galaxy A52 5G began shipping in the U.S. back in April after previously going on sale in the UK.  The Galaxy A52 5G costs $499/€429, and comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. This is the same price as the Google Pixel 4a 5G, $100 more than the basic iPhone SE (which lacks 5G connectivity), and $200 more than the OnePlus Nord N10 5G.The latest rival for the A52 5G is the Google Pixel 5a. At $449 it costs a little less than the Samsung, and while it misses out on some features like the 120Hz refresh rate or multiple rear cameras, the Pixel 5a offers stellar photography and a bright colorful display that may turn your head.Samsung has given its new batch of mid-range Galaxy A phones — which include the A32, A52, A52 5G and A72 — another colorful, playful design. I don't think it looks quite as stylish as the Galaxy S21 series, but there is still a lot I like about it.I particularly love the color options, especially my demo model's Awesome Blue (yep, that's its actual name), though the Awesome Purple, White and Black all have their charms. The single-piece back, which near-seamlessly flows up into the camera module looks great, and gives the Galaxy A52 5G its own fully formed identity, rather than it being a knock-off Galaxy S or Galaxy Note device.The Galaxy A52 5G features a plastic back, but at least it doesn't feel cheap, thanks to a nice semi-matte texture that keeps the fingerprints at bay. From the front, the A52 5G looks like all modern Samsung phones, with its central punch-hole camera. The top and bottom bezels are a little thicker than the average phone, but otherwise the Galaxy A52 5G looks just as smart as a Galaxy S21. The metal edges share the same color as the back. Samsung has again placed the volume and power buttons on the right side of the phone, leaving the left totally blank.In terms of durability, the Galaxy A52 5G has a IP67 water/dust resistance rating, which means it can survive 30 minutes under about three feet (1 meter) of water, and won't let in any dust.The Galaxy A52 5G’s display is one of its strongest features. You get a bright and colorful 6.5-inch screen with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate — a rare feature in a phone that doesn't carry a flagship's lofty price.The downside with the Galaxy A52's display is that the refresh rate is static, with options for 120Hz or 60Hz only. A dynamic system, like what you get with the S21 family, means a phone can save battery life while offering its max refresh rate when it's needed. In contrast, the A52 52's approach requires you to pick between a high refresh rate and a lower battery life or vice versa. At least the refresh rate is faster than the Pixel 4a 5G, which maxes out at 90Hz.While watching the trailer for Rick and Morty's fifth season, it was immediately obvious that the A52 is an excellent phone for streaming fans. The large panel rendered the anarchic animation clearly, with the show's bright and varied colors showing up vividly on the bright AMOLED panel. How bright? We measured the Galaxy A52 5G at 708 nits with adaptive brightness turned on. That's brighter than both the Pixel 4a 5G (638 nites) and iPhone SE (625 nits). Set the Galaxy A52 5G to vivid mode, and you'll get a lot of saturated colors — 201.35% of the sRGB color spectrum to be exact. Colors are much more accurate when set to Natural mode, which recreates 128.1% of the sRGB spectrum. To put that number in context, the iPhone SE hits 111.2% while the Pixel 4a 5G gives you 140.6%. In natural mode, the Galaxy A52 5G's screen is more accurate than the Pixel 4a 5G's — Samsung's phone has a Delta-E rating of 0.22 compared to 0.30 for the Pixel — but the iPhone SE (a 0.20 rating) is more accurate than both. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)Unfortunately, the Galaxy A52 5G’s display picked up some scratches during my testing. The phone didn't come from Samsung with the scuffs, and I only laid it down on a mousepad and duvet when not testing it, in addition to wiping it down periodically with a micro-fiber cloth. I didn’t even put the phone in my pocket before noticing the scratches.When we reviewed the Samsung Galaxy A20 last year, that phone also picked up scratches without any obvious cause, although on its plastic back rather than the screen. The A52 5G uses sturdy Gorilla Glass 5 on its display, so we're baffled as to why this problem has struck again except on the other side of the phone. We've reached out to Samsung for comment, but for now we advise you use a screen protector if you buy this phone.Samsung has included a headphone jack on the A52 5G, which is great for anyone still clutching onto their wired headphones. That also helps emphasize the stereo speaker system on the A52 5G, which is quite good. Listening to black midi's ""John L,"" the strings, guitar and vocals of the self-described ""infernal din"" came across clearly, even in the song's quieter moments. Even as the discordant melody rose in intensity (and I increased the volume), the mix remained well-balanced. Considering the price of the phone, the Galaxy A52 5G has some impressive lungs.Stereo speakers are sometimes found on phones in this price range; the Pixel 4a 5G has them, for example. In comparison, the quality of sound broadcast from both phones' speakers is about the same, but the mix is different. The Pixel is much more treble-forward, which is great if you're listening to spoken word content or the average piece of music. However, listeners with a love for thumping bass or a flatter tone will like the A52's system more.You get a generous four sensors on the back of the Galaxy A52 5G, but some are more useful than others. The main camera is 64MP, but by default it takes pictures at 12MP to keep the images file sizes smaller. The other main sensors are a 12MP ultrawide shooter and a 5MP macro camera, with the last sensor being a 5MP depth camera for adding depth-of-field effects to portrait mode shots.I tested the Galaxy A52 5G’s cameras against the Pixel 4a 5G's dual rear cameras, which feature a 12MP main sensor and a 16MP ultrawide sensor. For the main camera test, I chose this view of Highgate No 1 Pond at Hampstead Heath in London. While I appreciate the more honest coloring of the Pixel 4a 5G's photo, the brighter colors from the A52 5G, aided by its much larger sensor, make for a far more attractive image.I took the same photo with the A52's camera set to its full 64MP resolution, and other than lighting changes caused by clouds passing overhead, there's not much difference beyond the fact you can zoom in much further. Without a dedicated telephoto camera on the A52 5G, being able to take large images like this will let you take acceptable zoomed-in shots, although they won't hold up next to a proper optical zoom lens.I tried out these sensors in night mode also, with a portrait-oriented shot of Tufnell Park's Boston Arms pub. Google's Night Sight mode is one of the best low-light photo modes in the business, so it's no wonder I prefer it more here. The A52's image is brighter, which could sometimes be of use, but it's far less saturated than the Pixel's shot.Now we come to the ultrawide camera, which I tested by shooting down the north side of Parliament Hill, back at Hampstead Heath. This is probably the worst comparison of all for the A52. Its small sensor produced a dim shot compared to the Pixel 4a 5G.I also tested the Galaxy A52 5G’s macro camera, a feature the Pixel 4a 5G doesn’t have. This close-up of the dialing pad in a London telephone box, is better than I thought it would be, particularly with reproducing the many different colors in the weathered metal. Where this photo falls down is its limited focal range, causing the ""5"" button to look blurry.I don’t particularly like the portrait mode photos taken by either phone here, as both shots appear oversaturated. However, the depth sensor-assisted A52 5G delivers a more natural-looking blur than the software-only Pixel 4a 5G.Here we see a portrait image taken with the two phones' front-facing cameras. Neither phone was able to accurately capture all my hair flying about in the wind, but generally both phones provided good quality software bokehs. The Pixel 4a 5G is my favorite here, as its tendency toward more saturated images makes my skin and the sky in the background look much nicer.Overall, the Galaxy A52 5G’s cameras make it more versatile than the Pixel 4a 5G, but Samsung's camera phone is a step behind in terms of overall photo quality. The Pixel 4a 5G remains one of the best camera phones available for less than $500.With a mid-range Snapdragon 750G chipset and 6GB RAM, the Galaxy A52 5G should offer the power you need to accomplish everyday tasks.On the Geekbench 5 benchmark, the Galaxy  A52 5G got an average score of 637 in the single-core test, and 1,866 in the multi-core one. That beats the Pixel 4a 5G's scores of 598 and 1,614. This is to be expected since the 750G and 765G chips both debuted in 2020, but Samsung has released its phone much later, giving the company more time to optimize the chipset. The A52 5G still gets crushed by the iPhone SE, though, which managed scores of 1,337 and 3,226 with the help of Apple's still-mighty A13 Bionic chipset.On the 3DMark Sling Shot Unlimited test, which measures graphical power, the A52 5G managed 2,875 points, which is lower than the Pixel 4a 5G's 2,959 points. This can possibly be explained by the Google phone using a slightly better Adreno 620 GPU than the Samsung's Adreno 619.Trying out Call of Duty Mobile and Brawl Stars revealed the A52 5G does a decent job of playing mobile games. Both titles had a few jagged edges, likely a result of the below-average GPU performance and the screen's FHD resolution, but I still had a blast with both titles, thanks to smooth overall performance from the 750G chip and the 120Hz refresh rate display.You have 4,500 mAh of battery capacity in the A52 5G, a generous amount of room for a phone of this price. In testing how much YouTube I could watch, I found that 5 hours of video streaming over Wi-Fi (my standard Sunday afternoon) drained the battery from 100% to 68%. Safe to say, the A52 should last as long as you'd expect from a battery of this size.Our battery test backs that up. We set phones to surf the web continuously over cellular and the Galaxy A52 5G held out for 12 hours and 19 minutes, placing it high on the best phone battery life list. That result came when the phone's refresh rate was set to 60Hz, though; turn on the 120Hz refresh rate, and the endurance drops to 10 hours and 19 minutes. Still, even that time is better than the average smartphone's.Samsung offers support for 25W fast wired charging on the A52, and throws in a charger in the A52's box too, an accessory you no longer get with its flagship phones. The catch is that the included charger is only a 15W model; you'll have to buy a separate 25W brick if you want max speeds.With the bundled charger, the A52 5G filled from empty to 31% in 30 minutes when we tested charging in our lab. It took around 90 minutes to charge the phone to full. This puts it firmly in the middle of the pack when comparing it to rivals. The Pixel 4a 5G has a maximum charge speed of 18W, but since an 18W charger comes with the phone, it charges faster than the basic A52 5G package does, up to 46% full in 30 minutes.Samsung is one of the most notorious manufacturers for stuffing its phones with pre-installed apps. These are great if you're already well integrated into the Samsung ecosystem, but otherwise they just take up storage space along with slots in your app drawer and home screens that could otherwise be left clean. At least you can delete them if they bother you too much.The look of Samsung's One UI 3.0  built on top of Android 11 doesn't appeal to me much. As a fan of simplistic Android skins like OnePlus' OxygenOS or the stock Android of the Google Pixel phones, the sheer quantity of colorful custom icons strikes me as a patchwork eyesore. The silver lining I suppose is that One UI looks distinct. You won't ever mistake this Samsung for another brand of phone.The one Samsung-unique feature I do like is the phone's Edge Panels. These let you place various apps and tools within a set of menus that slide from the side of the display. It's a cross between the normal Android quick settings menu (which you can still access as normal from the notification shade) and an iPhone-style Control Center with its mix of practical and personalized options. Edge Panels are something that a power user would love to spend time with tweaking to their exact needs.There are also some things I really like about the Galaxy A52 5G, including its playful design, the 120Hz refresh rate and its versatile main 64MP camera. And the performance and battery life are very solid for the price. However, a couple of things frustrated me about this phone, including the easily scratched display. And while Samsung offers more cameras than the Pixel 4a 5G, Google’s phone tends to take better pics overall. While we've not put it head to head with the Pixel 5a yet, we'd imagine this statement holds true there too.The Google Pixel 4a 5G remains the better choice for the money, assuming you want 5G in your Android handset. Stepping down to the Nord N10 5G is probably only worth it if you're on a very tight budget. If you're very interested in the A52 5G's high refresh rate or its main camera, though, those are good enough reasons to go for this over the more well-rounded competition."
37,Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/qualcomm-smartphone-for-snapdragon-insiders,"Qualcomm's announcement earlier this summer that it would team up with Asus to make the not exactly evocatively named Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders caused a lot of head-scratching in the mobile world. Qualcomm certainly knows its way around mobile chipsets, the thinking went, but what's the point of building your own handset, when plenty of the best Android phones already showcase Qualcomm silicon?Now that we've gotten our hands on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders — really, they couldn't come up with a snappier name? — Qualcomm's reasoning is a little clearer. Qualcomm wants to show off everything its chips can do — not just performance and graphics, but in capturing photos, providing stellar audio and keeping you connected. There are Qualcomm technologies involving gaming and charging to highlight, too.And that's what Qualcomm's Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is meant to do — give us a phone that puts many of the chip maker's innovations front and center in a smartphone. In this Smartphone for Snapdragon for Insiders hands-on, we'll see how close Qualcomm comes to delivering on that objective.Starting price: $1,499 Screen size: 6.78-inch AMOLED (2248 x 1080; 144Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 16GB Storage: 512GB Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 8MP telephoto  with 3x optical zoom Front camera: 24MP Battery size: 4,000 mAh Charging speed: Qualcomm QuickCharge 5.0 Size: 6.8 x 3 x 0.38 inches Weight: 7.4 ouncesThe Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders costs $1,499. If that price makes you gulp, it's because Qualcomm's phone is one of the most expensive available, topped only by the $1,799 Galaxy Z Fold 3 Samsung introduced this month. The Galaxy S21 Ultra, the most expensive option in Samsung's Galaxy S21 flagship lineup, costs $300 less than the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders.Of course, that $1,499 buys you more than just a phone. Qualcomm includes a pair of MW08SI wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation from Master & Dynamic, a charging case for those earbuds, a custom rubber bumper to protect the phone and charging cables plus a 65W charger for your phone. That latter accessory is more than Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 owners can expect.You can only order the phone if you're a member of Qualcomm's Snapdragon Insider program, which in addition to giving you the chance to buy $1,500 handsets also delivers behind the scenes information about Qualcomm's various mobile initiatives. The Insider program is free to join.As of this writing, Qualcomm says carrier certification is still in progress with U.S. wireless providers, so it's unclear with networks will welcome the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, though 5G support for the phone is quite extensive, as we'll see below.Unlike the reference designs Qualcomm builds to let people test out its chipsets, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders has a decidedly more polished form that doesn't look out of place among other Android handsets. That's likely because Qualcomm tapped Asus to build its phone, and the result is a decent-looking handset with rounded edges, a midnight blue matte finish and red accents.The back of the phone features a Snapdragon logo that lights up when the phone comes to life or when you launch a new app. Above that is a thumbprint scanner for unlocking the phone. The scanner lacks any sort of cutout or guide to help you place your finger, so if you're staring at the front of the phone, it may prove hard to unlock it by tapping around. I found the sensor pretty hit or miss, though thankfully, you can also enable face unlocking as well.The other noteworthy design flourish on the back of the phone is the rear camera array, featuring three lenses arranged in a vertical strip. The rectangular array juts out pretty far, so that it's impossible to set the Qualcomm phone on its back without resting on the array. On the bright side, the array is so large that the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders doesn't rock back and forth.I can't pretend to be in love with the look of the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. It's functional enough, but a bit on the heavy side at 7.4 ounces. The iPhone 11 Pro Max I use every day actually outweighs that, at 7.9 ounces, but the weight feels more evenly distributed in Apple's device. The trend in higher-end phones these days is to ramp up the refresh rate on the screen for smoother scrolling and more immersive experiences. Many flagship phones like the Galaxy S21 series opt for 120Hz as the maximum refresh rate. The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders does that one better by going with 144Hz on its 6.8-inch OLED panel, a refresh rate typically found on gaming phones.I found I had to crank up the brightness on the screen to enjoy its colors, but once I did, the bright pinks and vibrant look of Girls5Eva streaming on Peacock looked just as accurate on the Qualcomm phone's screen as the warm 1970s film stock of The Godfather.Then again, you're not picking up the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders for its design or display. You're interested in this phone because you want to experience Qualcomm's top mobile features. And the Snapdragon 888 system-on-chip that powers the device helps put those front and center.If you keep tabs on the latest Android phones, you're well aware of what the Snapdragon 888 can do. It's the fastest chipset yet for Android phones, though it lags behind the pace set by Apple's A14 Bionic chip. That trend continues with the Smartphone for Snapdragon insiders, at least based on our testing.Across multiple runs of Geekbench 5, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders posted single-core and multicore scores of 1,125 and 3,697, respectively. That's ahead of the Galaxy S21 Ultra (1,123/3,440) and in line with the OnePlus 9 Pro (1,126/3,685), two other Android flagships that rely on the Snapdragon 888. The iPhone 12 Pro Max trounces its Android competition with single and multicore scores of 1,603 and 4,111, respectively.The story's the same when we tested graphics. Like the OnePlus 9 Pro and Galaxy S21 Ultra, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders tallied a little more than 34 frames per second on 3DMark's Wild Life test. That's about what you'd expect from the best Android phones, though it trails the iPhone's result.It's worth focusing on graphics performance, and not just because the Adreno 660 GPU on the Snapdragon 888 chipset promises a 35% boost in graphics performance over the last generation of Qualcomm 8 series silicon. Qualcomm has also made gaming one of the pillar features on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, including Snapdragon Elite Gaming features designed to bring a console-like experience to mobile devices.That means features like Variable Rate Shading, which not only boosts gaming performance but also offers better resolution and higher frame rates while consuming less power. The phone also supports Qualcomm's Game Quick Touch technology that boosts responsiveness on games by up to 20%.I have no way of verifying whether that helped with the games I played on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. But whether I was turbo-boosting my way past the competition in Asphalt 9: Legends or blasting at the competition in PUBG Mobile, I didn't notice any graphical lags and the controls did what I expected them to do when I pressed the on-screen buttons. If there's one area where the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders definitely delivers, it's in supporting demanding games, making this one of the best gaming phones, if you're willing to put up with its high price.Just as important as the gaming experience to Qualcomm is what you can do with the cameras on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. To that end, Qualcomm has opted for a setup that mirrors what you'd expect from a top-of-the-line camera phone. A 64MP Sony IMX686 sensor provides the main camera, with 12MP ultrawide and 8MP telephoto lenses joining that shooter on the back of the phone. The telephoto lens is capable of a 3x zoom.It's not just the optics on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders that matter, though, with the software also having a few notable features. The device uses a Spectra 580 triple ISP that aims to produce stellar shots no matter the lightning conditions. In particular, Qualcomm calls out the phone's prowess with low-light shots and the bokeh effect produced in its portrait images. The ISP also teams with the phone AI Engine to lock on on what you're shooting and keep it in focus.Despite the considerable effort Qualcomm puts into both camera hardware and smarts, the results were mixed when I compared photos taken by the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders with those from an iPhone 12, one of the best camera phones we've tested in the last year. When shooting an apple growing on the tree in my backyard, the Qualcomm phone did an excellent job balancing the afternoon sunlight to create a colorful shot that highlights the strips of red streaking across the apple. The iPhone 12 photo is probably the more accurate of the two, but the Qualcomm shot is more pleasing to the eye.Moving inside to a restaurant at night, a plate of lasagna doesn't show up as well in the photo from the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. That shot is darker than I like and the decorative splatters of olive oil are lost on the plate. Everything about the iPhone 12 shot — the tomato sauce, the herbs dotting the top of the lasagna — looks more vibrant.Qualcomm's pride in its low-light photos is justified when I tried out the phone's night mode, in this backyard scene lit only by a string of green LED lights overhead. I think the Qualcomm phone did a better job of balancing the green lighting of the scene, as the iPhone gets a little too aggressive in trying to brighten the image. That said, in the iPhone shot, you can detect some of the colors of the stuffed animals, whereas everything's the same shade of green in the Qualcomm photo.I was less impressed by how the Qualcomm phone handled portrait shots. It gets the color of my face right, though my features look a little bit sharper in the iPhone 12 portrait shot, especially when you zoom in. The major difference here is the background blur — not only does the iPhone 12 offer a more artistic blur, it does a better job of figuring out where I end and the background begins. If you look closely on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders photo, the wisps of beard on the left side of the shot have disappeared into the background blur.To test out the telephoto and ultrawide lenses, I switched to an iPhone 11 Pro Max for comparison shots, since it has a dedicated telephoto lens like the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. Despite the fact that the iPhone 11 Pro Max is nearly two years old and that its telephoto lens tops out at 2x, it gets the better of Qualcomm's phones in both comparisons.Neither zoom shot is particularly good — the Oakland skyline is fuzzy in both photos — but there's also fuzziness in the foreground of the Qualcomm photo. Even worse, while it was an overcast day when I took these photos, the iPhone 11 Pro Max manages to find some blue in the sky. Everything in the Qualcomm shot looks gray and muted.That continues when we switch to a wide angle view of the same shot. The Qualcomm photo is better than the telephoto one — like the iPhone 11 Pro Max, it manages to capture the reflection of the boats on the water. But again the sky is washed out and lacks the blue hue of the iPhone shot.By far, though, the most disappointing images from the Smartphone for Snapdragon insiders comes the device's 24MP selfie cam. The photo produced by that camera seems to have struggled with focus and color, making my skin look blotchy and blurred. That's not an issue with the iPhone 12 shot, where my skin is at least the right color.Not everyone shares my opinion about the lackluster performance of the Qualcomm's phone cameras. As this Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders hands-on is being published, camera experts DXOMark is giving the phone a high score for its cameras, rating it No. 1 among U.S. camera phones. Of course, DXOMark has the advantage of testing the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders with a software update that wasn't available to me. That software update, coming later this month, improves camera tuning, autofocus, texture and noise performance and night shot quality. Hopefully, it addresses the issues I ran into; we'll revisit this hands-on if it does.Besides still images, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders offers both 8K and 4K video capture, with the latter shot at either 60 or 30 fps. (8K video is only available at 30 fps.) The video footage I shot looks smooth and free of shake. I was less impressed with an auto-tracking feature that keeps the camera focused in on a subject of your choosing, even as they move around; I ran into problems with focus and auto-zooms that I'm hoping to see corrected when the promised camera software update arrives.The camera experience isn't the only incomplete one I came across while using the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. Qualcomm has also placed an emphasis on audio, with support for Snapdragon Sound. This new technology from the chip maker is supposed to deliver 24-bit 96kHz music streaming as well as support for super wideband voice to improve your sound on phone calls. To power that audio experience, the phone ships with Master & Dynamic's MW08SI wireless earbuds, which feature active noise cancellation.Unfortunately, the review unit supplied by Qualcomm featured pre-production earbuds that weren't enabled to support Snapdragon Sound. That means no high-resolution music streaming or super wideband voice — not for me anyhow. There was an over-the-air software update for the MW08SI earbuds meant to address some minor bugs, but repeated attempts to download it proved fruitless.So I can only address the experience I had with the earbuds and the dual speakers on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, features which were very incomplete at this point. At least the earbuds deliver strong bass, with the drumline that opens Imagine Dragon's ""Monster"" rumbling in my ears. Higher tones sounded a bit more muted to my ear, though, with the Girls5Eva song ""Space Boys"" sounding a lot cleaner when I listened using a pair of AirPods connected to an iPhone 11 Pro Max. Perhaps the software update for the MW08SI earbuds will straighten that out, once I get it to download.The final marquee feature in Qualcomm's smartphone is one that people may not appreciate right now, especially if they're sticking close to home. But as 5G networks continue to expand, you'll find the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders boasts extensive 5G options — ""comprehensive support"" for both sub-6GHz and millimeter wave-based bands, Qualcomm says. The X60 modem on the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders should deliver top speeds, too.At least, that's the theory. I haven't been in any hurry to upgrade to a 5G phone myself and so I don't have any 5G sim available to take the phone out for a spin. (Even if I did, I'm not sure how much faster download speeds would be over LTE at this stage in 5G's development.) I hope to be able to test out 5G performance on this phone shortly.Closer to home, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, the latter of which adds support for 6GHz wireless spectrum. Both flavors of Wi-Fi 6 should speed up your connectivity — at least if you've upgraded to a Wi-Fi 6 router that's capable of delivering this improved performance to any compatible devices on your home network.The Smartphone for Snapdragon insiders supports Qualcomm's QuickCharge 5 technology, which promises super-fast charging. According to Qualcomm, 30 minutes of charging should get an uncharged phone to 70%, while you can expect the phone to be fully charged after 52 minutes or so.That wasn't quite what I experienced when I plugged a drained Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders into the included 65-watt charger and started a stopwatch. After half-an-hour, the phone hit 46% — off Qualcomm's promised pace — though after an hour, the phone was essentially charged at 96%. Later in my testing, the battery indicator dipped below 20%, and in the time it took me to shower, dress and comb my hair, the phone was fully charged. That's fast enough for me.But it's not the fastest charging phone. That honor goes to the OnePlus 9 Pro, which also supports 65W wired charging, and can go from drained to fully charged in a little more than 30 minutes. (There's a reason we gave the OnePlus phone a Tom's Guide 2021 award.) The OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging, too — you can't wirelessly charge the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders at all. A 4,000 mAh battery keeps the Smartphone for Snapdragon insiders powered up. While we haven't run a formal Tom's Guide battery test on this device — in that test, we set phones to surf the web over cellular until they run out of power — I'd expect all-day power from this phone. I generally got around a day-and-a-half of standard phone use from the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders before I had to plug in, so this is a phone that seemingly makes the most out of its battery life.Likely, any question you had about whether to buy the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders was answered the moment I mentioned how much it costs — something about a $1,500 price tag triggers the sound of wallets around the country snapping shut. Indeed, Qualcomm clearly does not anticipate this phone selling like hotcakes, reserving it for members of its Snapdragon Insider program instead of putting it out for wider release.So why put out the phone when you know it's only going to land in the hands of a limited number of people? I think it's because Qualcomm wants to show us what's possible — what kind of experiences its silicon can power when a phone maker throws all restraint out the window and pushes a flagship Snapdragon system-on-chip to its limits. In this sense, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders does put Qualcomm's best foot tentatively forward.But not completely forward, as the need for software updates to fine-tune the camera and sound experiences give the impression that this phone remains a work in progress. For that reason, we're holding off on a final verdict and rating for the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders.We can say that even if these promised updates do significantly improve the phone, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders won't be for everyone — the price tag assures that. But if future updates can improve the features found in this device, it bodes well for future Android phones that turn to Snapdragon to deliver these kinds of experiences — ideally in more affordable packages."
38,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-pros-and-cons,"Update: Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 3 with a more durable design, water resistance S Pen support and improved multitasking. See our Galaxy Z Fold 3 review in progress. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is a quantum leap better than the original Fold. And it needs to be for the high price. The front display is a lot bigger, 5G is standard, and the unsightly notch on the inside is gone. Plus, this foldable is more durable than the first Fold.Samsung has further innovated to make this phone-tablet hybrid a lot more versatile, thanks to a new Flex Mode. Plus, the multitasking is better for running up to three apps at the same time, and several apps have a dual-pane view for enhanced productivity.The Galaxy Z Fold 2’s cameras are not as advanced as what you'll find on the Galaxy S21 Ultra (especially the zoom) and the design is pretty hefty. Plus, Samsung is reportedly prepping the Galaxy Z Fold 3 for a launch that's tipped for August, a sequel that may offer S Pen support along with other upgrades.But if you're in the market for a foldable phone now, the Z Fold 2 does a very good job of justifying Samsung's high asking price. It's no wonder why we named this the best foldable phone in our Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones.Price: $1,799 OS: Android 10 Main display: 7.6 inch inches 120Hz (2208 x 1768 pixels) Cover display: 6.2 inches 60Hz (2260 x 816 pixels) CPU: Snapdragon 865 Plus RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB Rear cameras: 12MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP telephoto (2x optical/10x digital zoom) Selfie cameras: 10MP (cover), 10MP (main display) Battery: 4,500 mAh Battery life: 10 hours 10 minutes Size: 6.2 x 2.6 x 0.66 inches (closed); 6.2 x 5 x 0.27 inches (open) Weight: 9.9 ouncesThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 release date was September 18, 2020. It's available for sale through multiple carriers as well as unlocked.When it debuted the Galaxy Z Fold 2 cost $1,999 for 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. Note that a microSD card slot is not included and there are no other capacities available. These days, after a permanent $200 price cut, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 sells for $1,799. (That could be a sign that Samsung is looking to clear out stock in advance of the anticipated launch of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 later this year.)To put the Z Fold 2's price in context, Microsoft charges $1,400 for its Surface Duo phone. To see how similar these two foldable devices are, check out our Microsoft Surface Duo vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 face-off.If you're looking for Galaxy Z Fold 2 deals, the phone has been discounted as low as $999. So it can pay to look for sales on this foldable phone. The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is available through all of the major carriers, including AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile (Sprint), as well as unlocked. Samsung offers the Galaxy Z Premier Service for the Z Fold 2, which includes on-demand concierge support from dedicated experts. In addition, Z Fold 2 owners can get a membership to FoundersCard, access to a prepared meal from a Michelin star restaurant and access to a various golf clubs.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 immediately makes a better impression than the Galaxy Fold because of its larger exterior display. You no longer feel like you're operating Android through a peep hole, and that's because the cover screen has grown from 4.6 inches to 6.2 inches.The interior display is also bigger at 7.6 inches for the Galaxy Z Fold 2, compared to 7.3 inches for the previous model. Even better, the ugly notch on the main screen is gone, replaced by a small cutout for a selfie camera.Samsung also made several enhancements fo the Galaxy Z Fold 2 to improve durability and usability. This includes a sturdier new Ultra Thin Glass display, which is designed to provide a better touchscreen feel than the plastic screen Fold, and a Hideaway hinge that uses sweeper technology to prevent dust and dirt from entering the phone.In a third-party test by YouTuber JerryRigEverything, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 survived having dirt thrown on it, which suggests that the new hinge works better than on the original model.Similar to the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, the Galaxy Z Fold 2's hinge uses a CAM mechanism that allows you to position the screen in multiple positions. And while there's still a gap between the two sides of the phone when closed, it's narrower than before.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 comes in two colors: Mystic Bronze and Mystic Black. But you'll be able to add some flair in the form of four hinge color options if you order through Samsung.com. Options include Metallic Silver, Metallic Gold, Metallic Red and Metallic Blue.Measuring 6.2 x 2.6 x 0.66 inches when closed and 6.2 x 5 x 0.27 inches when open, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 is slightly shorter but wider than its predecessor. It's also heavier, as the Z Fold 2 weights 9.9 ounces, compared to 9.48 ounces for the original model. I definitely felt a bit of strain after using the phone several minutes and typing out messages.Another bummer: The Galaxy Z Fold 2 doesn't offer water resistance, so you can't get it wet as you can with other flagship phones.In addition to a larger size, the 7.6-inch main display on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, so you should enjoy smooth scrolling and overall performance compared to the 60Hz rate on the Galaxy Fold. Plus, because the panel is adaptive, it's smart enough to dial the rate down or up based on the content on screen.The cover display on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 does not offer a 120Hz refresh rate, but it's still a heck of a lot better than what the first Fold featured. Measuring 6.2 inches, this OLED screen is big enough to perform pretty much any task, and you can still instantly resume what you were doing on the main display when you unfold the device.Just keep in mind that the aspect ratio on the Z Fold 2's cover display is narrower than most phones, so typing can feel a bit cramped.One of the complaints we had about the Galaxy Fold is that many of the apps just felt like blow-up phone apps in tablet mode. But Samsung is addressing this drawback with the Galaxy Z Fold 2. For example, in Gmail I could see my messages on the left and the body of emails on the right. And in Slack my contacts were on the left and messages on the right. You need to flip the Galaxy Z Fold 2 display's orientation to landscape mode to see these changes, but it makes a huge difference in productivity. And it makes the Galaxy Z Fold 2 feel more laptop-like. Samsung also promises an optimized viewing experience in Microsoft Office and YouTube.The Galaxy Z Fold 2's Flex Mode gives this foldable phone a lot of versatility. The idea is that you can have controls or settings on one side of the display and content on the other for maximum productivity. I really enjoyed using Google Duo in Flex Mode, as it lets you set the phone down in a laptop-like position and have a video call with the other person without having to hold the device. It's something I immediately wished my iPhone could do.Samsung says that Flex Mode is supported by several Samsung apps, including Camera, Video call, Gallery, Video player, Clock and Calendar. And Google is supporting Flex Mode with YouTube as well as Google Duo. Samsung is working with third-party developers as well to create Flex Mode optimized apps.Another key Galaxy Z Fold 2 upgrade is multi-tasking. With the improved Multi-Active Window feature, you can open up to three apps at the same time and can quickly create presets called App Pairs that you launch with just a tap.I tried this with Slack, Twitter, and Spotify as well as YouTube, Photos and Messages, and it was very cool to launch three apps at once.You can also quickly re-arrange the layout with a tap or drag an app from one window to another.Even cooler, you can also drag and drop content from one window to another. I had no problem dropping a photo from the Gallery app into an outgoing message. However, it didn't work with the Google Photos app. Multiple Samsung apps support Drag and Drop, as does Microsoft 365, Gmail, Chrome and Google Maps.Samsung's App continuity feature is also on board from the original Galaxy Fold. The idea is that you can start an app on the cover display, open the main display and pick up right where you left off. This worked in most apps, but the Sky Force 2 game forced to me restart the app when moving to the bigger canvas.It's a bit strange to say this, but the $2,000 Galaxy Z Fold 2 represents a step down from the $1,300 Galaxy Note 20 when it comes to the cameras. You don't get a 108MP main sensor, a 5x optical zoom or a 50x Space Zoom, but you do get three capable shooters you can use in a variety of ways.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 features a 12MP main wide-angle camera, a 12MP ultra-wide angle camera with a 123-degree field of view and a 12MP telephoto lens with a 2x optical zoom and 10x digital zoom.The fun really starts with the camera features that are unique to the Galaxy Z Fold 2. For example, Dual Preview lets subjects see how they're going to look using the front display while you're taking the shot. You can also take higher quality selfies with the rear cameras.All you need to do is fire up the camera on the cover display and then press a button in the top right corner, then the Z Fold 2 will invite you to unfold the device and you'll see a live preview. Another perk: you can prop up the Galaxy Z Fold 2 in what looks like laptop mode and it will keep your subject in focus when shooting video using a feature called Auto framing. Thanks to Flex Mode, you can also review recent pictures on the bottom half of the screen while maintaining the live preview in the top half.The Z Fold 2's camera did a fantastic job capturing a close-up of these yellow and violet flowers. You can make out fine details in the petals and even fine droplets of water when you zoom in.I also took this selfie using the rear 12MP camera and the Z Fold 2's cover screen as the viewfinder. The blue in my shirt pops, and the surrounding trees and grass look vibrant. You simply can't do this on an iPhone.As expected, the 10x digital zoom proved disappointing compared to the more powerful Space Zoom on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. As we zero in on the tree and hanging flower baskets, there's a fair amount of grain. It's certainly passable, though.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 did a fairly good job in this portrait shot, artfully blurring the photos in the background. The bokeh effect is better on the Z Fold 2 than the iPhone 12. However, my face is a bit more blown out in Samsung's shot. In this shot of fall decorations, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 delivers a brighter overall image, and you can make out lots of detail in the turkeys. The iPhone 11 Pro Max does a better job rendering the hay but overall I give the edge to Samsung here.The Galaxy Z Fold's 2 Night mode worked well in this shot taken in near darkness of a wall hanging. However, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's Night mode captured a considerably brighter image of the scene.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 sports a Snapdragon 865 Plus processor along with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage (UFS3.1). So we would expect similar performance to the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 scored 3,193 on the mult-core portion. The Note 20 Ultra with the same chip scored a slightly higher 3,294 and the Asus ROG Phone 3 hit 3,393. The iPhone 11 Pro was fastest with 3,500.On the GFXBench graphics test, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 scored 1,461 frames on the Aztec Ruins (High Tier) off-screen benchmark, compared to 1,455 for the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and 1,657 frames for the iPhone 11 Pro.Overall, the Z Fold 2 offers smooth performance, but I noticed minor software glitches at times. The YouTube app view didn't change I switched screen modes at one point, but restarting the app resolved the problem.In terms of 5G, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 supports both mmWave and sub-6GHz flavors, so you should have no problems tapping into 5G networks where there is coverage. I didn't see the best results in central New Jersey. On AT&T's network the Galaxy Z Fold 2's download speed hit only 22 Mbps, but on T-Mobile it was a much higher 122 Mbps in the same location.Because the Z Fold 2 also supports Ultra Wide Band technology, you can leverage Samsung's Nearby Share features to quickly share files with other compatible devices, which thus far only includes the Note 20 Ultra.The Galaxy Z Fold 2 packs a 4,500 mAh battery, which should be able to get you through most of the day. The Galaxy Fold had a slightly smaller 4,380 mAh, so this is a step up. On our battery test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness, the Galaxy Z Fold 2 lasted 10 hours and 10 minutes on the 60Hz display setting. That's not enough to make our list of best phone battery life, where are the handsets last longer than 11 hours. But given the size of the Z Fold 2's display that's pretty good endurance.As expected, the battery life dropped on the Z Fold 2 with the display set to 120Hz (adaptive), with the phone lasting 9 hours and 5 minutes.Anecdotally, the battery life on the Z Fold 2 is pretty solid. I started using the phone at 10 am and after a day of heavy usage it had about 18% juice left at 10 pm.The Z Fold 2 supports 25W fast charging, as well as fast wireless charging and PowerShare reverse charging. But we didn't see the best results in our testing. After 30 minutes the Z Fold 2 was at 46% and we would expect 50%.  By comparison, the Note 20 Ultra hit 56% in the same amount of time.Note that a Galaxy Z Fold 3 is rumored to launch this summer. It's expected to include a faster processor, S Pen support and perhaps an under-display camera, among other upgrades. So you'll probably want to hold off until mid-August until you make a move.Overall, though, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 is the quintessential example of a company listening to its customers and delivering a wide range of improvements they asked for. Even at its reduced $1,799 price, this is a phone that's still very much for early adopters. At least the Z Fold 2 seems a lot less like a prototype and more like a viable product.The front display on the Galaxy Z Fold 2 alone is a huge upgrade. I also really like Flex Mode and the versatility that gives this phone. Being able to prop up the device at various angles really makes the Z Fold 2 feel like a brand new type of device. And while the Mult-Active window multitasking requires a bit of a learning curve, it maximizes productivity.If you want a more powerful phone and better cameras, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is the better option, but Apple doesn't have anything nearly as innovative in its lineup to take on the Z Fold 2. An iPhone Flip could be on the way at some point, but we doubt it will be anytime soon.Overall, I am really impressed with what Samsung has accomplished with the Galaxy Z Fold 2. This is clearly the best foldable phone yet and a sign of great things to come in the category."
39,Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-s21-plus,"OS: Android 11 / One UI 3.1 Screen size: 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 48Hz - 120Hz Processor: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 12MP wide (f/1.8), 12MP ultra-wide (f/2.2), 64MP telephoto (f/2.0) with 3x hybrid zoom/30x digital Front camera: 10MP (f/2.2) Video: Up to 8K at 24 fps Battery: 4,800 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 09:41 (adaptive) /  09:53 (60Hz) Charging: 25 W (charger not included) Colors: Phantom Black, Phantom Silver, Phantom Violet, Phantom Red, Phantom Gold Size: 6.36 x 2.98 x 0.31 inches Weight: 7.05 ouncesThe Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus once again proves why Samsung is the dominant Android phone manufacturer. The company pioneered things we take for granted nowadays like huge displays. Samsung has previously taken a “throw everything at the wall to see what sticks” kind of approach. And although it might’ve seemed silly at points in the past, this MO has given us mainstay features.With the Galaxy S21 Plus, however, Samsung takes a step back, restraining itself to instead offer a compelling, big screen device. All of the over-the-top focus was on the Galaxy S21 Ultra, while the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are more iterative upgrades on their S20 predecessors.Though we are conditioned to not only want the newest thing, we’re also taught that the latest version ought to offer significant upgrades. Some might see a few of the design choices with the Galaxy S21 Plus to be downgrades or Samsung standing in place, but I argue that’s not the case. Despite feeling like the awkward middle child of the S21 family, the S21 Plus offers a lot to love.In the US, the Galaxy S21 Plus starts at $999 for the 128GB model. That’s a $200 drop from the Galaxy S20 Plus’ starting price. An extra $50 doubles the storage on the Galaxy S21 Plus to 256GB.  In the UK, the S21 Plus starts at £949, with the 256GB variant costing £999. For reference, the Galaxy S20 Plus launched at £999 in 2020. You can purchase the Galaxy S21 Plus directly from Samsung or through your carrier. Before you do, check out the best Galaxy S21 deals to see if there’s ways to save on the Galaxy S21 Plus.The Galaxy S21 Plus’ price is identical to the iPhone 12 Pro. You can also draw comparisons between the Galaxy S21 Plus and Google’s $699 Pixel 5, which despite having lower-tier specs still kicks above its weight in raw camera performance.Since Samsung copied Apple and didn’t include a charging brick, you’ll need to figure out a charging solution. If you have a 25W brick from the S20, or something similar, you’re good. But if you’re using an older USB-C charger, you’ll want to consider a wireless charger or the $20 25W wall charger from Samsung. You will get a USB-C cable with the phone, though.On its face, the Galaxy S21 Plus looks quite similar to the Galaxy S20 Plus. It has very appealing slim bezels with a single hole punch cutout for the front camera in the center of the top edge of the display. Depending on which color you picked — the Galaxy S21 comes in Phantom Black, Phantom Silver or Phantom Violet — you can also see the edge of the frame around the bezels, making for an attractive device. The screen is now flat instead of curved, which may not look as pretty, but leads to fewer inadvertent touches. It’s on the back that Samsung made some changes from last year’s S20 Plus. The triple camera module no longer sticks out on its own, instead melding seamlessly into the frame in what Samsung calls the contour cut design. Though the S21 Plus still has a noticeable camera hump, it looks less awkward than its predecessor’s.Smooth to the touch, the back doesn’t show fingerprints or smudges very easily. Despite its size, I noticed that the Galaxy S21 Plus didn’t slip around in my hand. It's a very grippy device that I haven't worried about dropping or sliding out of my pocket.The Galaxy S21 Plus is not a small phone at 6.36 x 2.98 x 0.31 inches, weighing in at 7.05 ounces. It’s practically the same size as the Galaxy S20 Plus (6.37 x 2.90 x 0.31 in, 6.56 oz). One-handing the Galaxy S21 Plus can be difficult, especially if you have smaller hands. If big phones are your thing, though, this one will make you happy. Samsung touts the new and improved fingerprint sensor under the display, which is 1.7x larger and 50% faster than its predecessor. While previous models have had varying degrees of accuracy, the sensor in the S21 Plus is quite reliable. It’s quick and very accurate.For the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus, Samsung “downgraded” the display to a 1080p resolution. However, you can have the 120Hz adaptive mode enabled at all times at this resolution. Contrast this to the Galaxy S20 Plus last year, where you had to choose between QHD 60Hz and 1080p 120Hz. Now, you just choose which refresh rate you want.If you want things to be as buttery smooth as possible, then leave your S21 Plus display on the adaptive mode. This will let the display’s refresh rate shift between 48Hz and 120Hz, which means that phone can adapt to your use and save battery life where possible. If you want to get the most out of your battery, however, then lock the display to 60Hz and let it be. You’ll be missing out on noticeable differences, but at least Samsung offers the choice.Moving onto the quality of the display itself, Samsung opted for a top-tier screen after all. In both the Natural and Vibrant settings, colors pop and blacks are very deep. It gets plenty bright enough for direct sunlight, while media, games or videos, look great on this screen.In our lab testing, the Galaxy S21 Plus managed 103.8% of the sRGB space and 73.5% of DCI-P3 in Natural mode. In Vivid, the phone hit 212.3% of sRGB and 150.4% of DCI-P3. The iPhone 12 Pro, meanwhile, reproduced 115.6% of the sRGB color gamut and 81.9% of DCI-P3. And finally, for its Delta-E color accuracy rating, the S21 Plus got a 0.18. That handily beats both the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (0.24) and iPhone 12 Pro (0.28), as numbers closer to zero are more accurate.Whatever mode looks best to you, Vivid or Natural, you’ll have one of the best smartphone displays around. I really enjoyed watching and playing things on this phone. I checked out Blade Runner 2049 from my Plex server, which has scenes later in the movie with harsh orange tones. The Galaxy S21 Plus handled these wonderfully.The Galaxy S21 Plus uses the same camera setup as the Galaxy S20 Plus. It features 12MP wide-angle, 12MP ultrawide, and 64MP telephoto lenses. The latter camera sports a 3x hybrid optic zoom and 30x space zoom. Samsung’s trump card this year, however, comes down to software, as it finally learned from Google and that company’s Pixel 5.I tested the default photo mode of the Galaxy S21 Plus against the iPhone 12. (I don’t have a 12 Pro for photo comparisons, but with the exception of a telephoto lens, the iPhone 12 gives the S21 Plus a pretty fair fight.) Right off the bat, you can see the Galaxy S21 Plus saturates the photo more than the iPhone 12’s image — too much so in my opinion. Apple’s device also captures the shadows better, whereas the S21 Plus bumps up the exposure and flattens a lot of the blacks.For another outdoor shot, t the Galaxy S21 Plus managed to capture the car’s details fairly well considering that I took this shot in direct sunlight. You can see the red stripes along the Mini’s skirt and the brake rotors behind the spokes of the rims. The refracting sunlight isn’t so harsh, either. Meanwhile, the iPhone’s shot has that awful lens flare ruining the whole image. You can still make out some details, but overall I think the iPhone effort is a worse photo.Moving indoors to my office, the Galaxy S21 Plus once again brightened everything up in this picture of the office decor, with the color on my metal poster looking a bit washed out. The iPhone 12 produced something much truer to life with more realistic colors. While still well-lit, the iPhone’s shot captures the warm tones of the wood paneling, the soft grey of the concrete Celtic cross, and just a bit of the tiny dots of color in the cross-stitch pattern.Once again, when testing portrait mode, both phones took two different approaches. The Galaxy S21 Plus photo is more true-to-life with a soft blur radius. I’m in clear focus with accurate colors. The iPhone 12 cooled everything down significantly, possibly due to the combination of shadows with the snow in my backyard. The blur radius is similar to the S21 Plus’, but everything from my face to the smoker behind me is way too cool. Even the sky is too blue. This was consistent across portrait shots.At night, the Galaxy S21 Plus tends toward darker photos compared to the iPhone 12. The Galaxy S21 Plus still retains a lot of detail, even if it is a bit darker. The iPhone 12 is noticeably brighter with deeper shadows and more detail in the bricks. Both are quite good, but I like the iPhone 12’s night mode performance better.For the front-facing camera, I stepped into the shadows behind this row of townhouses. Right away, you can see how cool and smoothed the Galaxy S21 Plus’ shot is. The blue of my eyes appears despite a bit of a squint, the grey of my shirt is truer to life, and the fences behind me are the right colors. On the other hand, the iPhone’s selfie is a bit weirder. Notice how everything got warmed up, like the tint and black level correction got overtuned. My face appears much redder than usual, my beard looks darker than it is, and the wood fences seem a bit off.Finally, Samsung stresses the zoom capabilities with its new phones. The S21 Plus offers a 3x hybrid optical zoom telephoto lens, which is already neat for far away shots. But with that comes Space Zoom, which can net you up to 30x zoom photos, letting you capture things that are ridiculously far away. For quick reference, here’s the S21 Plus’ max zoom versus the iPhone 12’s. You can easily spot the differences, and it’s no contest between the two. The S21 Plus could pick up the pink stool at the very end of the road, whereas you can barely see it in the iPhone 12’s picture.As far as video, the Galaxy S21 Plus can go all the way up to 8K at 24 frames per second (fps). If you want something a bit more reasonable, the phone also supports 4K at 60 fps and 1080p at 120 fps. All told, you can have super smooth, high resolution videos that look awesome later when you go to watch them. If you opt for 1080p at 60 fps, you can use the Super Steady mode, which utilizes AI to help eliminate hand shake in your recording, making for an even smoother video.If you’re really into vlogging, you can switch on Director Mode, which activates both the rear and front cameras for recording at the same time. Director Mode also generates live thumbnails from all of the S21 Plus’ lenses.Some of the other features Samsung packed into the Galaxy S21 Plus’ camera include the portrait video and an updated version of Single Take. The former is just what it sounds like, where the subject of the video is kept in focus while the background remains blurred. The blurring can get a little overzealous when you move the camera around, but it’s all around pretty solid.Single Take lets you choose from a selection of the best shots in a given scene. The S21 Plus will actually capture multiple photos at a time, so that you can pick the best one for your needs. This might be helpful if your pet or child happens to move while you attempt to photograph them.Samsung brought to bear its best with the Galaxy S21 Plus’ cameras. It goes head-to-head with other heavyweights like Google and Apple and holds its own quite well. While I don’t have a Pixel 5 to test it against, you can check out the camera section of our Galaxy S21 review to see how these cameras compare against Google’s latest. In the end, the S21 Plus’ cameras really impressed me. Although the phone’s cameras like to oversaturate and overexpose sometimes, the photos that it produces come out nice most of the time.U.S. versions of the Galaxy S21 Plus uses Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 system-on-chip (SoC. (In the rest of the world, your S21 Plus is powered by the Exynos 2100.) Compared to the Snapdragon 865, the 888 promises 20% better CPU performance, 35% improvements in GPU speed, and upgrades to the AI capabilities. Samsung paired this processor with 8GB of RAM in the Galaxy S21 Plus, making for a very powerful phone.Unlike the Galaxy S20 Plus, there’s no 12GB RAM option with the S21 Plus, but most people don’t need that much memory in the first place. Power users can always turn to the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which will better suit their needs with its 12GB and 16GB options. So the S21 Plus losing 4GB of RAM in today’s age isn’t as bad it might seem. Android has gotten better with memory management and Samsung has a few tweaks in One UI to help with that, too.In testing, the Snapdragon 888 still falls behind Apple’s A14 Bionic SoC. For Geekbench 5, which measures single- and multicore performance, the Galaxy S21 Plus hit 1,116 in single-core and 3,300 in multicore. Compare the latter to the results of the iPhone 12 (3,859) and the iPhone 12 Pro (3,880).For the GPU, we used the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited test, which pushes the GPU hard to render challenging scenes in real time. The Galaxy S21 Plus managed a final score of 5,571 with an average fps of 33.37. Compare this to the iPhone 12 Pro’s 6,567 and 39 fps.Finally, we ran the Galaxy S21 Plus through a video transcoding test, where the phone must transcode a 4K video to 1080p in the Adobe Premiere Rush app. The S21 Plus managed a time of one minute, the best we’ve seen from an Android phone. But as good as that task was, the iPhone 12 Pro did the same task in a mere 27 seconds.Once again, the iPhone beats the leading Android devices in raw performance, but synthetic benchmarks don’t tell the whole story. In daily use, I didn’t find the Galaxy S21 Plus to be lacking in any regard. I played Call of Duty: Mobile, Pascal’s Wager, and Grid Autosport on max settings, all of which push the phone hard. The phone handled all of them brilliantly. I also tried some Xbox Game Pass and Steam Link streaming to it with no problems. The Galaxy S21 Plus also works well with the Razer Kishi gamepad, which levels up mobile gameplay considerably in the games that support it.As with display size, the Galaxy S21 Plus sits right in the middle of the S21 and S21 Ultra when it comes to battery life. The S21 Plus and its 4,800 mAh battery turned in a so-so performance in our battery tests and even threw in a little surprise for us.Tom’s Guide’s proprietary battery test involves a phone being left to endlessly load webpages over and over using a cellular connection. We tested the S21 Plus on both adaptive and 60Hz modes on T-Mobile 5G.In adaptive mode, the Galaxy S21 Plus reached 9 hours and 41 minutes, which is just shy of the 10-hour mark we see on average. For reference, the Galaxy S21 Ultra hit 10:07 in adaptive mode, while the Galaxy S21 managed 6:31. So 9:41, while not great, is respectable. Meanwhile, in 60Hz mode, the S21 Plus reached 9:53. Compare that to the S21 Ultra’s excellent 11:25 and the S21’s 09:53.That result surprised us. As you can see, there’s quite a disparity between the 60Hz and adaptive modes in terms of battery life for the S21 and S21 Ultra. However, the S21 Plus has nary a noticeable difference between the two, meaning that you don’t save a lot of battery life by using the 60Hz mode on this phone.As you’ve heard by now, none of the Galaxy S21 phones come with a charger. They do include a USB-C cable so that you can use a charging brick you already own. Or, you can buy one separately at your discretion. The phone supports up to 25 W of fast charging, and you also have the wireless charging route if you so choose.Until very recently, Samsung had a lousy reputation for software. But when Samsung introduced One UI a couple of years ago, things changed. It proved that the phone maker was taking software seriously and offering a more mature skin, something more akin to Google’s stock Android.One UI looks nice, feels slick in its animations and transitions, and does a fairly good job at staying out of the way while offering useful features. Samsung made something that offers elegance that doesn’t feel bloated. Sure, the S21 Plus has unnecessary apps pre-installed, but a surprising amount can be uninstalled and you can disable the rest. Overall, a lot of people will like the One UI experience.With the Galaxy S21 series, Samsung introduced One UI 3.1, which came with several changes. A few of these include the Google Discover feed integrated into the stock launcher, Google Home device controls, Google Duo baked into the stock phone app, video call effects, and several enhancements to the camera app. Not all is well with One UI, however. Samsung wants you to use its features out of the box, including Edge Panels and the Bixby shortcut. Considering how useless Bixby is, even when compared to Siri, I highly recommend changing what a long press of the power button does so that it no longer wakes Bixby. We have some quick Galaxy S21 tips to get you started.I replaced the S21 Plus stock launcher with a third-party one — first Nova, then Niagara. The paginated app drawer in the One UI launcher is frustrating and I thought it a relic of the long-forgotten past. Out of the box, Samsung organizes the apps in some nebulous, contextual manner, but when you have a lot of them, things can get irritating. Luckily, you can organize the drawer alphabetically.Samsung could address a lot of my One UI complaints by offering more choices during initial setup. It could let you choose your navigation model (nav bar or gestures) and whether you want certain features enabled or not, for example. A lot of people simply won’t spend a lot of time digging through the settings menus to find what they want.The Galaxy S21 Plus comes with Android 11, which is great. Samsung has promised that it’ll provide three years of OS updates for its phones, meaning that the S21 Plus will probably see Android 14 in 2023. This is a huge improvement versus the Samsung of the past and I’m happy to see this. How quickly the company will release updates is another issue entirely.The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is right around the corner, and it's rumored to start at $999 like the Galaxy S21 Plus. But beyond just folding up in half, does the Z Flip 3 stand to offer as much as the S21 Plus does? We can only go off of rumors right now, but the short answer is: We think the S21 Plus will be the better phone.For starters, the Z Flip 3 looks like it'll only have two cameras, and we'd guess that the second one is an ultrawide. That means no telephoto on the Flip 3. Furthermore, we've heard that the battery on the foldable won't be as large as the S21 Plus', meaning that it won't last nearly as long as the more traditional S21 Plus.We'll have to see how the two phones compare once we have them both in hand.All told, Samsung nailed it with the Galaxy S21 Plus. It has most of the strengths of the smaller S21 in a bigger package. If you don’t want to shell out $1,199 for the Galaxy S21 Ultra, the Plus model is the next best choice if you prefer a big phone.Samsung might have pared back the features on the S21 and S21 Plus, but I think it works in this phone’s favor. Having the display tuned down to 1080p works just fine, especially in the adaptive refresh rate mode. If you’re using a Galaxy S20 Plus, however, this isn’t a worthy upgrade. The software features Samsung introduced with the S21 will trickle down to your device, if they haven’t already. You still have excellent performance, an awesome display, and plenty of camera power to keep you happy.Moreover, if you’re using a Galaxy S20 FE, then I strongly recommend against upgrading to the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus. Samsung put out a great phone with the S20 FE and it’s honestly the best Android competitor to the S21 and S21 Plus at this point. Other than the Snapdragon 865, the S20 FE is remarkably similar to its S21 cousins (the Ultra notwithstanding). The Galaxy S21 Plus is not a bad purchase at $999. It’s got a lot going for it. If you’re coming from an older device, like the Galaxy S10 series, this is a solid upgrade."
40,Samsung Galaxy A32 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-a32-5g,"OS: Android 11 / One UI 3.1 Display: 6.5-inch LCD (1600 x 720) Refresh rate: 90Hz CPU: MediaTek Dimensity 720 RAM: 4GB Storage / Expandable: 64GB  / Yes Rear cameras: 48MP (f/1.8) main, 8MP (f/2.2) ultrawide, 5MP (f/2.4) macro, 2MP (f/2.34) depth Front camera: 13MP (f/2.2) Video: Up to 4K at 30 fps Battery: 5,000mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 11:39 (adaptive), 12:22 (60hz) Charging: 15W Colors: Awesome Black, Awesome White, Awesome Blue, Awesome Violet Size: 6.46 x 3.00 x 0.36 inches Weight: 7.23 ounces5G has become more prevalent recently, so it’s no surprise to see 5G support appearing in less expensive phones. Samsung’s midrange A models now include 5G, and the cheapest of the lot — the Galaxy A32 5G — lets you enjoy faster networking speeds for $280. That’s a major bargain, even with some serious shortcomings. As you’d expect for $280, there’s nothing high-end about the Galaxy A32. The 720p display isn’t good, the performance is mediocre at the best of times, and it’s a rather large device that might be hard to manage for some people. However, the Galaxy A32 5G packs incredibly impressive battery numbers, a 90Hz refresh rate on the TFT LCD panel, and Samsung’s promise of three years of platform updates and four years of security patches. US shoppers will see similarities between the Galaxy A32 and  the OnePlus Nord N200 5G, which I called the best cheap 5G phone when I reviewed it a month ago. At $40 less than the A32, the Nord N200 does a lot of things right, sporting a notably better display and similar performance. However, Samsung wins out in the camera department, as you’ll see below. And with much longer support, the A32 is a safer bet long-term, making it one of the best cheap phones you can buy.Our Galaxy A32 5G review will walk you through exactly what this phone does well and where it’s lacking. If you want 5G under $300, this is a phone you must consider.The Galaxy A32 5G has the benefit of being available basically anywhere. It has the full weight of Samsung behind it, and you can buy it through a variety of wireless carriers, as well as Samsung itself and Best Buy. It’ll run you $279.99 outright for 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, though you can probably find a good deal around with a trade-in and/or same-day activation.The A32 doesn’t support mmWave 5G, but it does come with C-Band support (which is important for some of AT&T’s and Verizon’s future 5G expansion plans). The lack of mmWave on the Galaxy A32 5G isn’t surprising — it’s a premium feature that’s often seen as a luxury these days.At first glance, the Galaxy A32 5G looks very nice. The three vertical camera lenses, coupled with the macro camera and flash, make for a subtle camera module on the back of the phone. With a glossy plastic body, the A32 really attracts fingerprints, which requires frequent cleaning to keep it looking sharp.The display takes up most of the Galaxy A32’s front. The chunky bottom and top bezels, however, muddle any illusion that this is an edge-to-edge screen. The front camera is housed in a teardrop notch up top, not the hole-punch cutout we see on other phones, like the Nord N200 5G.The A32’s power button also houses the fingerprint sensor, which worked well enough in my testing. I did have trouble with proper placement with my left index finger sometimes, but the phone recognized my right thumb pretty much every time.At $280, it should surprise no one that the Galaxy A32 5G feels cheap. The buttons ring hollow and loud. You do get a headphone jack, something you don’t find on the much more expensive flagships.We don’t see a lot of phones with TFT LCDs anymore, but Samsung went with this option to keep the Galaxy A32 5G’s cost down. It’s definitely a far cry from the company’s Super AMOLED panels and at 720p, the screen’s sharpness won’t knock your socks off. It’s a middling 6.5-inch display that struggles with crushed blacks, so-so brightness, and washed out colors.Watching videos on the Galaxy A32 isn’t the best experience, whereas the OnePlus Nord N200 5G had a decent display that did a much better job with colors, viewing angles, and deeper blacks. Holding both phones next to each other shows the visible differences between TFT and IPS LCD panels. (The latest Nord features the latter.)The displays on both phones can go up to 90Hz, though, which is really nice to see for devices that cost less than $300. That higher frame rate means that scrolling will be smoother. Games that support high refresh rates will also theoretically look better, too, if the Galaxy A32 could muster the power it would need for such a task.I watched my favorite scene in the later parts of Blade Runner 2049 with its extreme orange color palette. On most phones, this scene looks rich and draws you in with the strangeness and mystery of it. On the Galaxy A32 5G, it looked washed out and bland.Looking at the display lab results shows off more differences between the A32 and Nord N200. The A32 produced 96.1% of the sRGB and just 68.1% of the DCI-P3 gamuts. The Nord N200 managed 160.7% of the sRGB spectrum and 113.8% of the DCI-P3. The A32’s Delta-E score, where 0 is perfect, is pretty high at 0.35, too. Compare that to the Nord N200, with its 0.25 Delta-E score.As for brightness, the Galaxy A32 hit a max of 485 nits in our testing (with the Nord N200 seeing a lower 415 nits). Seeing such a mediocre display from Samsung is quite surprising, especially since OnePlus offers a superior screen on a phone that’s $40 cheaper.The Galaxy A32 5G employs four cameras: the 48MP main camera, an 8MP ultrawide shooter, a 5MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. As you might expect only the main and ultrawide cameras are worthwhile — the latter two don’t seem to add anything.Overall, the A32 does an admirable job for a phone that’s less than $300. It certainly fares better than the OnePlus Nord N200 5G, which I used for the following camera comparisons. Samsung likes to oversaturate on its more expensive phones, but that tendency is not as readily apparent on the A32’s photos. This could be because the processor doesn’t have the horsepower to do all the post-processing that higher-end Galaxy phones do.Starting off outdoors, the Galaxy A32 5G shot a well-balanced picture of these flowers. The colors are rich, the exposure is good considering how sunny the scene was, and the image altogether feels more alive. This is especially true when you look at the Nord N200’s image, which is flat, bland, dull, and generally lifeless. It’s an awful picture.For this second outdoor shot, the Galaxy A32 didn’t do as well as before, but still fared better than the Nord N200. This scene involved direct sunlight, and both phones struggled. Even so, the A32 did a better job with toning down the exposure and still showing off some of the flower colors. The Nord N200 couldn’t account for the sun or flowers, producing a blown out image that I wouldn’t dare post anywhere but here.Inside, the Galaxy A32 once again beats the Nord N200. The photo of Merida is vibrant with her red hair, blue dress, and the little details therein. The Nord N200’s image is flat and dull, with washed out colors and poor detail capture. Both phones struggled with soft focus, making the final images look blurry in some spots. I wouldn’t call either shot good, but the A32 clearly wins this one.Where the Galaxy A32 5G had trouble was with portraits. It struggled not only with the light coming in off to the right of the image, but also with color accuracy. The blur radius, however, is quite artistic, so I’m left to wonder if the issue here was just with the A32’s inability to handle poorer lighting conditions. Compare the image to the Nord N200’s portrait shot which, while more zoomed in with a weaker bokeh effect, looks more color accurate with a stronger focus on me. Samsung includes a night mode on the Galaxy A32 5G, and it’s not bad. Unfortunately, it’s not good, either, far from the likes of Google’s Night Sight on the Pixel 4a. However, it’s not as bad as the Nord N200’s night shot. Compared to the OnePlus phone, the Galaxy A32 produced a much brighter image of the smoker. Details remain scarce, but at least you can see the darn thing. The Nord N200 just shows a void of blackness.Finally, the Galaxy A32 5G has a 13MP front-facing camera. It’s not amazing, but it did produce a much better selfie than the Nord N200 did. The A32’s image is crisper with richer details, showing the ruddiness in my face and beard and the blue of eyes much better. The Nord N200 applied too much face smoothing and it’s not a selfie I’d ultimately be willing to post anywhere.The Galaxy A32 5G can record video up to 4K at 30 frames per second. That’s a lot of pixels for a phone under $300, though I’d wager most people will want to go with 1080p at 60 fps for a smoother video. Video recording on the A32 wasn’t amazing. Samsung’s phone ran into noticeable trouble correcting for the bounce and sway in my steps. It also struggled with background noise, with the final video being very loud with wildlife and cars providing a lot of distraction. The mic quality wasn’t the best, either, with my voice sounding hollow and far away.For a $280 phone, the Galaxy A32 5G can record decent video, but don’t expect too much out of it. If you’re just trying to catch a cute moment with your pets or a particular event with your children, it’ll get the job done.MediaTek-powered phones aren’t that common in the US, so seeing one from Samsung of all places was a bit of a shock. The Galaxy A32 5G uses the Dimensity 720 system-on-chip paired with 4GB of RAM. It’s not a powerhouse, but this chip lines up well with some of Qualcomm’s lower-tier offerings like the Snapdragon 480 5G found in the OnePlus Nord N200 5G. In day-to-day use, the Dimensity 720 does well enough, but anything more intensive than browsing social media and checking your messages is where you’ll notice slowdown.Gaming can be a chore sometimes on the A32, especially if you need to drop graphics settings to get any sort of reasonable performance. Lighter games will be fine, but anything that requires heavy lifting like Genshin Impact will make the phone noticeably struggle. That’s not surprising.In Geekbench 5, the Galaxy A32 5G scored 1,642 in multicore. The OnePlus Nord N200 5G managed 1,602 in the same test, so the phones are pretty close to one another. In the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited graphics benchmark, the A32 managed an average of 7.3 frames per second. The Nord N200 scored a lower 5.8 FPS.One of the Galaxy A32 5G’s greatest strengths is its battery life. With a 5,000mAh battery, the phone lasts an impressively long time considering its 90Hz refresh rate. I like to see phones last longer than 10 hours, which we would consider about average for smartphones nowadays. But the A32’s numbers might just earn it a spot on our list of the best phone battery life.To test batteries, we task phones to endlessly reload pages on a cellular connection at 150 nits of brightness until they die. In the adaptive mode, where the display clocks up and down depending on the content you’re consuming, the A32 went for 11 hours and 39 minutes. And in the 60Hz mode, the phone lasted for a longer 12 hours and 22 minutes.The OnePlus Nord N200 5G didn’t fare as well, seeing 10 hours and 28 minutes in its 90Hz mode and 10 hours and 36 minutes in its 60Hz mode. So the A32 lasted considerably longer, despite having the same size battery as the Nord N200.We also tested the recharge times for the Galaxy A32 5G, with the phone recharging from 0% to 14% in 15 minutes and to 27% in 30 minutes. That’s pretty inline with the Nord N200, which recharged to 32% after half-an-hour.Another plus for the Galaxy A32 5G, the software on this phone is practically the same as you’ll find on the Galaxy S21. And to go along with that, Samsung has promised three years of Android updates and four years of security patches. That destroys anything else in this product category, certainly the OnePlus Nord N200 5G with its paltry 1-year/2-year promise.Samsung’s One UI 3.1 looks very different from Google’s vision, but you might find it to your liking. Samsung even gives you the option of choosing which bloatware you want to install during setup, which is a great thing to see. You pick and choose what you want, or deselect them all.The software on the A32 doesn’t have much else going on, which is fine. Samsung has done a good job with making One UI very easy to use with slick animations, pretty transitions, and plenty of things tucked away in the settings.Buying the Galaxy A32 5G is a better decision long-term over the Nord N200, since Samsung will support the phone for much longer than OnePlus will update the Nord N200.The Galaxy A32 5G is a great phone for the price. It has notable drawbacks, like the display and performance, but it impressed me with its battery life. The cameras are pretty good for $280, but for $70 more, you can get the excellent Pixel 4a and its incredible camera. Granted, you lose 5G, but you also get a noticeably better display, too.And with Samsung’s great software update policy, the Galaxy A32 will last you for a few years before it hits end-of-life. There’s a lot to be said for that, and it helps make the A32 an easy recommendation for 5G on the cheap.The Galaxy A32 5G is good enough at most things and it packs a punch. That’s all you can ask for sometimes."
41,Motorola Moto g100,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-moto-g100,"Starting price: £449 Display: 6.7-inch FHD LCD (1080 x 2520) Refresh rate: 60Hz/90Hz Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.7), 16MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 2MP depth (f/2.4), time-of-flight sensor Front cameras: 16MP selfie (f/2.2), 8MP ultrawide (f/2.4) Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 RAM: 8GB/12GB Storage: 128GB/256GB Battery: 5,000 mAh Charging: 20W wired Operating system: Android 11 with MyUX Size: 6.6 x 2.9 x 0.4 inches (168.4 x 73.9 x 9.7mm) Weight: 7.3 ounces (207g) Water/dust resistance: Water repellent (no IP rating)The Motorola Moto g100 is the company's attempt to redefine what exactly budget phones are capable of. While you'll want to pick something else if you desire the best camera phone around, it gets an awful lot right for those who prize power and a premium screen.With some supercharged silicon and an impressive-looking display, you could mistake the g100 for a more expensive phone when watching movies or playing games. The Pixel 4a 5G is a more well-rounded handset for bargain hunters, but our Motorola Moto g100 review finds a slick, head-turning device. But some might be put off by its average power and display.The Moto g100 is available from Motorola U.K., Amazon and other major electronics retailers in the U.K. It's also just gone on sale in the U.S. from Motorola, as an unlocked phone that can be used with either AT&T or T-MobileCustomers will pay £450 for the g100 in the U.K., which also includes the ReadyFor cable and stand bundled in. That’s the same price as the Pixel 4a 5G, but that ReadyFor cable allows users the ability to connect their phone to a monitor or TV as well as a phone — something Google’s phone lacks. The U.S. price is $599, but it's currently on sale for $499.The front of the Moto g100 is, in a word, functional. The display has some thick bezels, typical of less expensive phones with LCD displays, although the dual front cameras offer something unique to look at. Checking around the edges will reveal a side-mounted power button/fingerprint scanner plus the volume buttons, on the right, and a Google Assistant button on the left. The bottom of the phone features the ubiquitous USB-C port along with an increasingly rare 3.5mm headphone jack.Turning the phone over reveals some surprises, both good and bad. The Iridescent Ocean back shifts from blue to purple in the light, and catches your eye effortlessly. Your other options are Iridescent Sky, which does something similar, but with a white base, and looks more elegant; and the U.S.-exclusive Slate Gray, which makes the g100 look a lot more grown-up. Unfortunately, the back on all versions is made of plastic rather than a more luxurious glass. It’s common at this price range, but still a shame to see. The Moto g100 features a curved back and a 2.9-inch width that’s more narrow than the average smartphone. It means that despite the large amount of screen space and the thicker than average depth of its body, the g100 feels easy to handle even with a single hand.The square rear camera bump protrudes only minimally from the main body, and three of the four cameras have a neat blue metal ring around the lenses. Motorola could have got away with something more spectacular considering the color scheme, but I appreciate the practicality of this uncomplicated design.There's a lot of screen real estate for the money with the Moto g100. At 6.7 inches and with an FHD display, this phone’s screen is on par even with some premium phones like the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus, at least in terms of size and resolution. The g100 also features a 90Hz refresh rate, which can scale down to 60Hz either manually or adaptively.Watching the Horizon Forbidden West trailer on the g100 and a Google Pixel 4a 4G, I noticed cooler colors on the Motorola, although Aloy’s journey through some dense forests and along the water’s edge didn’t look any worse, just different from what the Pixel displayed. The g100’s display is plenty bright enough too, even when I used it outdoors in some recent very sunny weather here in London.Although the Moto g100 has four round glass lenses on its back, only two of them are actually cameras — a 64MP main sensor and a 16MP ultrawide shooter. The other two lenses are a 2MP depth sensor and a time-of-flight sensor, both used to help with camera effects.I put the g100 up against a Pixel 4a 5G for this shot of Piccadilly Circus. The g100 produced a decent shot, though it’s not quite as bright as the Pixel’s image. That extra brightness benefits both the billboards and their reflections in the rain-slick road and sidewalk, and to a lesser extent the building fronts too, which makes the Pixel the clear winner.I also tried the main sensors in night mode while wandering around Coal Drop Yards near Kings Cross. The g100 produces images with a distinct yellow color cast, which isn’t ideal. While looking through the several shots I took the same evening, I also noticed that the g100 can’t quite get the balance right between brightening the image enough to see more of the scene and keeping the color of the sky, buildings and lights looking good. This is a balance the Pixel 4a 5G consistently strikes, thanks to Google’s excellent Night Sight low-light mode.An ultrawide shot, taken of the busy road crossing at Oxford Circus, is a closer contest. The Moto g100’s image is a little less saturated than the Pixel’s, which arguably makes it better since it’s a more accurate depiction of the dreary weather on the day I took the photos.The g100’s ultrawide camera has another trick up its sleeve. Thanks to a ring light built around the edge of the lens, Motorola claims it functions as an effective macro camera too. In theory, this solves the normal problem with macro cameras — that they don’t let in enough light because of how close you have to hold the phone to whatever it is you’re photographing. To try this out, I used a Redmi Note 10 Pro, which sports one of the best macro photo phones around, as the yardstick to measure the Motorola against.If this were any old macro camera, the Motorola’s well-lit (albeit yellow-tinged) shot of a wine bottle cork would beat it, since you can see a good amount of detail. However, I still prefer the Redmi’s shot, as the telemacro lens allowed for a greater distance between the phone and the cork, producing a more natural color. You see less of the cork due to the narrower lens angle compared to the Motorola shot. Plus, the small punctured portion is cast in shadow rather than lit up. But the Redmi has produced an all-around better image.The last two cameras on the g100 are a pair of depth sensors. This called for a portrait mode shot, for which I swapped back to using the Pixel 4a 5G as my comparison phone.The bokeh effect in the g100 image is spot on, featuring a nice amount of blur plus a near-flawless cut-out between my head and the background. I am a little over-exposed, though. The bokeh in the Pixel shot is post-processing-only, but still looks good. However I look much more normal, even if my skin tone looks a touch too saturated.We have two images to look at from the Moto g100’s front cameras, first off from the main sensor. Again the g100 image is strangely yellow, plus a little too bright for my liking. The Pixel selfie has a more normal color temperature, although I again have much pinker skin than I do in real life.The second set of shots were taken with the Moto g100’s ultrawide selfie camera and the Pixel 4a 5G’s equivalent zoomed-out selfie mode. While my complaints about the images’ coloring are the same, I do respect the utility of a front ultra-wide sensor. Even though I was holding the phone fairly close to me, there’s enough room in the Moto g100’s image for another one or two people, and holding the phone in landscape orientation and at arm’s length will leave more space to squeeze in you and your friends.The g100 contains a Snapdragon 870 chip and 8GB RAM, which are powerful specs for a phone of this price. The Snapdragon 870 is a step up from the Snapdragon 865 Plus that powered many top Android flagships in 2020, so that’s an impressive amount of power for a mid-range phone. For context, the identically priced Pixel 4a 5G uses a Snapdragon 765 chip, and only 6GB RAM.On the Geekbench 5 performance benchmark, the g100 scored 961 points in the single-core test and 2,855 in the multi-core test. That crushes the Pixel 4a 5G’s 598 and 1,614 scores, as well as the Samsung Galaxy A52’s 637 and 1,866 results. Before you get too excited though, the Samsung Galaxy S21, with its top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 chip, managed 1,048 and 3,302, so it's well shy of flagship-level performance.On the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited graphics benchmark, the g100 managed a score of 4,157 points and an average framerate of 24.9fps. That’s a ways behind the Galaxy S21 5,805 and 34.8fps, but miles ahead of the Galaxy A52’s 1,101 and 6.6fps.The  Snapdragon 870 chip means you can enjoy 5G connectivity with the Moto g100. Motorola’s device only offers sub-6GHz 5G, but this isn't a problem for U.K. customers who only have access to sub-6GHz 5G. For U.S. buyers, the moto g100 works with T-Mobile and AT&T's 5G networks, which are both sub-6GHz networks. You'll get faster 5G if you pick up a mmWave-compatible Pixel 4a 5G, but the Moto g100 should still offer future-proof data speeds.Motorola put a large 5,000 mAh battery, typical of the company’s G-series phones, in the g100. However, in my unofficial rundown test, discharging the phone from 30% to 0% by playing non-stop YouTube videos, the phone managed a rather average 3 hours and 58 minutes. This could be down to the g100’s large LCD display, which is less efficient than the OLED panels that many of its rivals use. Motorola's other phones manage this same test better. The LCD HD display on the g100's little sibling, the Moto g10, lasted closer to six hours when drained from the same amount of charge via non-stop video.The included 20W charger is perhaps a little underpowered for a phone with such a big battery. It fills the phone to just 34% in half an hour, and takes 1 hour and 35 minutes to fill the phone completely from empty. Those are identical timings to the Galaxy A52 5G (assuming you buy one of Samsung's 25W chargers separately), but slower than the Redmi Note 10 Pro, which fills 56% of its 5,020 battery in half an our with an included 33W charger.Motorola’s MyUX is very similar to stock Android, aside from a few custom colors and a couple of Motorola-made apps. For this reason, Android fans really won’t have much to complain about with the g100’s implementation of Android 11.A couple of features I like that are unique to MyUX include the Peek Display, which lets you check your notifications in full without unlocking the phone. And the Moto app, which is full of worthwhile tips to help you get the most of your phone.One of the big new features for the g100 is Motorola’s ReadyFor mode, which lets you open the phone’s apps on a monitor or TV via a USB-C to HDMI cable. When I tried out ReadyFor for a full day’s work, I found that the translation of Android apps to a desktop-style interface didn’t always work smoothly, with enough small inconsistencies to make working from the g100 irritating after an hour or two. That said, ReadyFor is definitely an easy way to put your mobile games or video calls on a big screen where you can make the most of the g100’s potent hardware.The Moto g100 is a real workhorse of a phone, covering all your needs as practically as possible. But unlike other members of the Moto G series, it’s also got some premium features that let the g100 excel in a few key areas.The Moto g100 provides get one of the highest performance to price ratios in all the smartphone market thanks to a generously mighty chipset; you get a lot of display space to make the most of that power, too At best, the Moto g100’s cameras are serviceable, though the ultrawide selfie camera is a standout. The software, assuming you’re using it on the phone itself, is nice and straightforward to use, and even if it can’t replace your laptop, ReadyFor still has a place as a big-screen gaming, movie watching or video conferencing mode."

And that’s true if you're asking for a great, reasonably-priced phone, and happen to live in Europe or India.Ignoring the question of availability, OnePlus has an amazing mid-range device on its hands. The parts that make up the Nord 2 are more than you'd expect for its price, with some components lifted straight from the flagship OnePlus 9 series. Even the places where OnePlus has made big changes — the cameras and the processor on the OnePlus Nord 2 — have paid off, with the quality matching the rest of the phone.In cutting back the extraneous elements from the first OnePlus Nord, OnePlus has been able to refine what remains, which is ultimately far more important than the extras the Nord 2 lost. If the Nord 2 is sold in your country and you've got a limited phone budget, this new Nord belongs on your shortlist next to the Google and Apple phones you were likely already considering.OnePlus is offering the Nord 2 for pre-orders from July 22, and for normal sales from July 28. You can buy the phone at the OnePlus online store, Amazon U.K. and John Lewis; or from mobile carriers O2 and Three. You can pick from one of two versions: a £399 model with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, or a £469 model with 12GB and 256GB instead.The OnePlus Nord 2’s chief competitors are the Google Pixel 4a 5G (£499), the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G (£399) and the iPhone SE (from £399). Not only is the Nord 2 competitively priced, but as you'll see below, it tops these other devices in several different areas.OnePlus isn't selling the Nord 2 in the U.S. sadly. Instead, its current mid-range offerings consist of the cheaper OnePlus Nord N10 and OnePlus Nord N200. Both of these are decent devices for their cost, but don't match the Nord 2 for quality.As I unwrapped the OnePlus Nord 2 from its plastic protector, I couldn't help but feel it was a dull successor to the original Nord. Last year's Nord was a brash upstart of a phone, with a huge number of camera lenses on both the front and back and a unique stadium-shaped camera block. The Nord 2, with a single front camera and a rectangular rear block containing just two main cameras, could easily be mistaken for any other budget Android phone out of China.The Nord 2 recovers from its generic design with an excellent selection of colors. The two available in the U.K. are the sophisticated Gray Sierra or the more playful Blue Haze, which I tested. Both colors offer impressive fingerprint resistance, so they'll maintain their good looks through everyday use.I love the feel of the Nord 2, which stands at 6.4 inches but weighs a delicate 6.7 ounces. Combined with the curved back edges, the Nord 2 feels secure to hold and all parts of the display are easy to reach. Part of the reason for this however is that the phone's back is made of plastic. The old Nord used a glass-like finish to give the impression of extra luxury, but there is no pretension here about materials. OnePlus claims the Nord 2 is splash-proof, but the phone doesn't have an official IP rating for water/dust resistance. This isn't unusual for OnePlus, since it's only just started to list IP ratings on its most expensive flagships.OnePlus also deserves kudos for making the Nord 2's box more eco-friendly. All the inserts, aside from the protective wrapping and the shrink-wrap around the charging brick, have been turned from plastic to paper, making them easier to recycle. Although Apple and Samsung went a step further and got rid of the included charging brick — a decision with some major cons — I am glad OnePlus still offers a charging brick by default.Keeping to a promise of a fast, smooth display, the Nord 2's Full HD AMOLED screen boasts a 90 Hz refresh rate. However the refresh rate isn't dynamic like you’ll find on more expensive phones, including the OnePlus 9 Pro. You set the 6.4-inch screen’s refresh rate to 90Hz or 60Hz in the settings menu and that's it. So you have to decide whether to prioritize display smoothness or the phone's battery life, and have to go through a few menus every time you change your mind.Your video viewing experience on the OnePlus Nord 2 is further enhanced with AI Color Boost and AI Resolution Boost on certain apps, including YouTube. I checked out the trailer for Marvel's What If…? and thought the animated series' bold style was well matched by the vividness of the OnePlus Nord 2 display; the phone's stereo speakers made sure the dialog and soundtrack came through with plenty of power too.The Nord 2 also boasts a smart ambient display, which adapts brightness based both on how bright your surroundings are and how bright the content on-screen is. While the phone was just about usable in very bright light, I can't say I noticed any big difference from other AMOLED phones I've used in the same situation.Cameras on the OnePlus Nord 2 are less extensive than what the original Nord offered. The good news is that this reduced range of sensors allows the Nord 2 to match up to the best cameras in its price range.The primary camera has a 50MP sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS). The 50MP sensor is the same one you can find behind the ultrawide lens on the OnePlus 9 series, but with added OIS for the kind of stability you need from the main camera.This shot of a handsome flower head I found in London's Whittington Park is evidence of the overarching theme of the Nord 2's photos —they're bright, at the expense of a little color richness. The Pixel 4a 5G offers some of the best photos from any phone, period, and produces a better-rounded image. However I think personal preference could still mean some users prefer the OnePlus shot.Swapping to the Nord 2’s full 50MP mode doesn't change much. You can see a little more of the veins in the petals of the flower, but in terms of color and meaningful detail, it's not that much better than the default 12.6MP image.OnePlus has also updated its low-light photo capabilities with a new Nightscape Ultra mode, boasting it can take photos even in dark, interior environments. I tested this with a line-up of espresso cups on a shelf in a dark room. Compared to the Pixel 4a 5G's Night Sight, the Nord 2's image is much warmer, seemingly aiming for the impression of the image being taken in daylight. Google's algorithm instead appears to give images a bluer tint. While I normally love the Pixel 4a 5G's low-light shots, in this example I think the Nord 2 offers something better.The other main camera on the Nord 2 is an 8MP ultrawide camera, ideal for fitting more into frame when up close to your subject. The big difference between these two shots of Whittington Park's World War I memorial is the contrast: the Nord 2's image is so much sharper compared to the Pixel's, it looks like it was drawn in a comic-book style. The Google phone's image remains the better one for color though, offering a more attractive saturation level.To round out the rear array, OnePlus has added a 2MP monochrome sensor. This doesn't actually take photos itself, but instead acts as an auxiliary sensor for the main camera to help add extra detail and texture when you enable a built-in black-and-white photo filter. This monochrome image of a log certainly turned out well, with the rings and bark all coming across clearly. The mono sensor is somewhat superfluous since it's not difficult to turn photos black and white in various mobile and desktop apps, but perhaps some users will find it convenient. Personally, I'd much prefer this to a basic macro camera, the throwaway sensor often found on phones in this price range.The Nord 2 features a single front camera, instead of the main/ultrawide duo OnePlus fitted to the original Nord. It's still an impressive 32MP sensor, which should provide plenty of detail for your selfies, but I kind of liked the utility of being able to fit more scenery or people with an ultrawide front lens.As we can see from these selfies, the Nord 2 is again producing brighter images. I'm quite impressed with the bokeh effect on the Nord 2, which is of similar quality to the Pixel's. Not only is it attractive, but also the division between me and the background is near-flawless. It's the coloring that draws me to the OnePlus' image more however. In the bright sunlight of a rare British heatwave, the OnePlus can keep me looking more or less my normal self, while the Pixel ends up making me look oddly dark red.OnePlus has broken from tradition with the Nord 2 by equipping it with a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI chipset, rather than Qualcomm’s Snapdragon silicon it's used since the OnePlus One. The ""AI"" version of this Dimensity chip is unique to OnePlus, and allegedly offers enhanced machine learning capabilities to the phone's photography and display compared to the vanilla chip.Joining the Dimensity 1200-AI is either 8GB or 12GB of RAM, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, OnePlus' habitual memory options for its latest phones. This is another area where the phone maker’s been quite generous, since comparable phones offer only 6GB RAM or less, and of that group, only the iPhone SE lets you spec up to 256GB storage.The results from the benchmarking apps for my 12GB OnePlus Nord 2 were suitably impressive. On Geekbench 5, a benchmarking app that tests general performance, the Nord 2 achieved scores of 786 for the single core test and 2,757 for the multi-core test. It is still a ways off beating the A13 Bionic-powered iPhone SE's 1,333 and 3,108. But the Nord finished well ahead of the Google Pixel 4a 5G (598 and 1,614) and Samsung Galaxy A52 5G (645 and 1,903), which are powered by the Snapdragon 765G and Snapdragon 750G, respectively.Looking at the results on 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited graphical performance test, the Nord 2 crushed the competition. The OnePlus' results were a score of 4,185 and an average frame rate of 25.1 fps. The Galaxy A52’s results of 1,106 and 6.6fps are nowhere near. The iPhone SE, with its flagship-grade chip, still defeats the Nord 2 with a score of 8,000 and a 47.9 average frame rate. The budget iPhone is an outlier, though, and it seems safe to say that switching from Snapdragon to Dimensity chips hasn't done the Nord 2 any harm.We may need to take these figures with a pinch of salt. OnePlus was recently caught throttling the performance of its 9 series phones on apps aside from well-known benchmarks. This may mean that in terms of real-world performance, these figures don't quite translate.Nevertheless, I tried out racing game Asphalt 9: Legends and found that my test results matched my real-world experience. While the gameplay was beautifully smooth when in normal graphics mode, the Nord 2 didn't quite have the power to run at the higher graphics setting without occasional stuttering. You'll still need a proper flagship phone if you want to get the best gaming experience.The MediaTek chip within the Nord 2 also adds 5G connectivity. Since this phone is bound for Europe and India rather than the U.S., it only supports sub-6GHz 5G, rather than the faster mmWave format available through some American carriers. What's more, none of the 5G bands listed in OnePlus' press material match up with those offered by U.S. carriers. That means even if you bring your Nord 2 to the U.S., you won't be able to benefit from 5G speed.This isn't much of an issue since the Nord 2 isn't sold in the U.S. It's still going to be a bit of a disappointment for overseas visitors though.OnePlus has fitted 65W wired charging to the Nord 2, which is the same charging system used on the OnePlus 9 series; it also remains faster than basically any other charging standard out there. Using that 65W technology, the OnePlus went from empty to 58% in just 15 minutes, and to 100% in an impressive 30 minutes, which means you need never worry about forgetting to plug your phone in overnight.You don't get wireless charging though, something that the iPhone SE does offer. As useful as it is to have the option to power up your phone without plugging it in, wireless charging remains a more premium feature and is therefore one of the most sensible omissions OnePlus made to keep the Nord 2's price down.The zippy charging feeds a 4,500 mAh dual-cell battery, which is again quite impressive for a budget phone since it's again taken directly from the OnePlus 9. As a result, the OnePlus Nord 2 lasts a while. I drained the battery by playing a 10-hour aquarium video on YouTube over Wi-Fi, with the display set to 90Hz, OnePlus' AI picture enhancements turned on, the phone's brightness slider fixed to the center and the speaker at mid-volume. It took 6 hours and 33 minutes to drain the phone from 50% to empty. While I don't have other phones to compare that result against directly, being able to watch more than 12 hours of video on a single charge seems to guarantee that the Nord 2 won't ever leave you in the lurch by suddenly switching off when you need it most.Running the show on the Nord 2 is OxygenOS 11.3, possibly one of the last OnePlus phones to use its own Android skin before the phone maker adopts Oppo's ColorOS on future devices. The switch is a shame since OxygenOS has consistently been one of the prettiest and best laid-out versions of Android around, and this upgraded version of Android 11 is no exception. Even better than the handsome visuals, OnePlus has pledged to two full Android upgrades and three years of security updates for the Nord 2, which is particularly generous for a low-cost phone. Between this and the 5G compatibility, there's no rush for you to upgrade from the Nord 2 as it ages, at least compared to the average Android phone.A related point to software is the Nord 2's introduction of Haptics 2.0, which makes the Nord 2 just as nice to type on as the OnePlus 9 Pro. I still prefer Google's phones when it comes to the perfect tap feedback experience though.OnePlus was brave when to choose its ""everything you could ask for"" slogan, but it's been proven correct in our OnePlus Nord 2 review. The Nord 2 ticks basically every box when looking at its specs, and is a capable new rival in the premium mid-range market, even if its claims of being a flagship killer aren't quite borne out. The Nord 2 is a phone to go for if you prioritize display quality and charging speed, but not one if you want the best performance. If you're a phone photography fan, the Nord 2 doesn't quite edge out the competition on image quality alone, but its cheaper price may convince you it's a better buy than a Pixel 4a 5G or an iPhone SE.The only major complaint I can levy at the Nord 2 is the fact that American readers can't buy it. Sure U.S. phone buyers can pick the Nord N10 or Nord N200, but they are far cheaper phones with more distinct flaws. The Nord 2, like its predecessor, is an outstanding mid-range phone that is unfairly kept from large numbers of potential customers."
43,TCL 20 Pro 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/tcl-20-pro,"OS: Android 11 / TCL UI 3.0 Display: 6.67-inch AMOLED (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 60Hz CPU: Snapdragon 750G RAM: 6GB Storage / Expandable: 256GB / Yes Rear cameras: 48MP (f/1.8), 16MP (f/2.4) ultrawide, 2MP (f/2.2) macro, 2MP (f/2.4) depth Front camera: 32MP (f/2.5) Video: Up to 4K at 30 fps Battery: 4,500 mAh Charging: 18W wired, 15W wireless Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 8:30 Size: 6.46 x 2.87 x 0.35 inches Weight: 6.7 ouncesThe TCL 20 Pro 5G is the company’s latest attempt to make a splash with phones bearing its own name, after years of building handsets for other brands. And this $499 phone is quite the looker, with a beautiful design and an immersive display..As strong as those features are, the TCL 20 Pro 5G ultimately disappoints in practically every other regard. From cameras that failed to capture good video to below average battery life,this mid-range phone fails to impress beyond its pretty veneer.As you’ll see in our TCL 20 Pro 5G review, the phone wants to do so much more, but it can’t quite live up to its similarly-priced (or even cheaper) rivals.The TCL 20 Pro 5G is available right now for $499, which you can pick up from Amazon in either Marine Blue or Moondust Grey. There’s only one configuration available with 256GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. This is a $50 price hike over last year’s TCL 10 Pro. Part of the increase comes down to 5G on the new phone — you get sub-6Ghz support, but no mmWave — and the improvements to the display tech. Overall, on paper, the TCL 20 Pro is a compelling device for $500. It does, however, face competition from the likes of the $399 iPhone SE (2020), $499 Pixel 4a 5G, and $499 Galaxy A52 5G.Hands down, the TCL 20 Pro 5G is the best looking phone at this price. Put TCL’s phone side-by-side with more expensive devices such as the OnePlus 9 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro, and the TCL 20 Pro 5G feels right at home. TCL deserves commendation for building a device that looks and feels great. The huge 6.67-inch display on the TCL 20 Pro is surrounded by minimal bezels — the screen even curves with adjustable palm rejection settings to make it work well for you. The front-facing camera sits in a hole punch cutout in the middle of the display’s upper edge, giving the TCL 20 Pro a Samsung-esque look at first.The back of the phone also impresses, with the cameras stacked vertically along the left border. My review unit is the Moondust Grey model, which looks quite unassuming. The other available color — Marine Blue — is quite stunning.Along the top of the phone, you’ll find a headphone jack and an IR blaster. The accompanying IR remote app lets you attempt to connect to a wide variety of TVs, but I didn’t have luck with my old Toshiba office TV. If you own a TCL TV or anything from the last few years, you’ll probably be able to set up the remote function.The star of the show with the TCL 20 Pro 5G is the phone’s display — a 6.67-inch FHD+ AMOLED panel, locked at 60Hz. TCL’s panel features excellent color calibration, staying nice and bright. You also get several great options for enhancing viewing experiences on the TCL 20 Pro. You can choose between two calibrations: Vivid and Natural. There’s also an option for image enhancement, including videos and games, that boosts contrast, sharpness, and provides HDR where applicable.My go-to thing to watch on phones is the scene in the later parts of Blade Runner 2049 where everything is orange. On the TCL 20 Pro 5G, this scene looked fantastic. From the stark contrast to the action-packed sequences, I really enjoyed watching the whole section on this phone. For $500, the TCL 20 Pro 5G has an awesome display, great for movies and games.In Vivid mode, the TCL 20 Pro 5G managed 184% of the sRGB spectrum and 130.4% of the more challenging DCI-P3 gamut. Our testing showed a Delta-E score (where 0 is perfect) of 0.28, which is a fairly standard ballpark for most phones nowadays. Compare that to the $500 Pixel 4a 5G, which netted 128.3% of the sRGB and 91.3% of the DCI-P3 gamuts with a Delta-E score of 0.3.The TCL 20 Pro 5G also has a sunlight viewing mode, which cranks up the brightness for outdoor use. With this setting enabled, the phone reached a max of 622 nits in our lab. That’s pretty close to the Pixel 4a 5G’s 638 nits.The TCL 20 Pro 5G has a 32MP front camera and four rear cameras: a 48MP primary shooter with optical image stabilization, a 16MP ultrawide lens, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. The latter two are effectively useless, as we’ve seen time and time again with other budget and midrange phones. In my opinion, they’re included only so that TCL can say the phone has four cameras.For the shootout comparisons, I used a Pixel 5, which has an identical camera setup to the Pixel 4a 5G. That should make it a fair fight with the TCL 20 Pro 5G, but TCL’s phone wasn’t always up to the challenge.For this outdoor shot, the TCL 20 Pro 5G did a decent job capturing the red of the flowers and the green of the other plants. However, the image appears overexposed, making for a washed-out photo and one that ultimately doesn’t look all that good in comparison to the Pixel 5’s. That phone kept the lighting in check while doing a nice job with the reds and greens. Despite the Pixel’s tendency to favor natural colors, I think the final image has richer tones than the TCL’s.Out in direct sunlight, the TCL 20 Pro 5G fared a lot better. It kept pace with the Pixel 5, capturing plenty of details without blowing out the final image. Direct sunlight can be a challenge for camera phones, and I found myself impressed with how well the TCL performed in this scene. There’s just a tad more saturation with the TCL’s image, which isn’t necessarily better than the Pixel’s natural colors — it just comes down to personal preference.Inside, the TCL 20 Pro 5G once again did a fine job with these flowers. While it managed to capture the colors pretty well, TCL’s cameras bumped up the exposure a bit too much given how bright the room was already. You only really notice this when comparing it to the Pixel 5’s shot, which is a bit dimmer but more accurate. The TCL’s image is by no means bad, though.The TCL 20 Pro 5G produced a decent portrait, though it opted for a zoomed-out look. The blur radius is acceptable. The final image is a bit cooler than the Pixel 5’s, which captured the warm tones of the room. The Pixel also created a better portrait, with a stronger bokeh effect and more emphasis on the subject. The TCL is fine, just not as good.It’s hard to go up against the Pixel 5’s Night Sight, but the TCL 20 Pro 5G did all right with its Super Night mode. The final image didn’t come out as bright or as sharp as what Google’s phone produced, but we’ve seen worse attempts recently. The TCL’s image still shows the smoker and some of the light on the other side of the fence. The Pixel’s picture is brighter and has stronger details.In this selfie, the TCL 20 Pro 5G struggled a bit with the sunlight filtering onto my face. The final image came out a bit bright and some of the finer details of my face were lost as a result. Compare that to the Pixel 5’s selfie, which managed to compensate for the sunlight all while capturing the ruddiness of my face and darker red in my beard. It even did a better job with my blue eyes than the TCL did.The TCL 20 Pro 5G supports up to 4K video at 30 frames per second in SDR, 1080p 30 with HDR. There’s also EIS to keep things stable and a couple of other options like better motion capture and such. The one thing I noticed while recording my sample video was that the final footage looked overexposed, much like the very first image in our still camera face-off. Colors looked washed out, and I wasn’t that happy with the final result.However, the EIS and two microphones did a good job at producing a stable video with decent sound quality. Overall, the TCL 20 Pro 5G is a respectable video recorder.The TCL 20 Pro 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G paired with 6GB of RAM. This processor is newer than the Snapdragon 765G in the Pixel 4a 5G, and they’re neck-and-neck in terms of performance. The 765G has the slightest advantage in some tasks and is slightly more power-efficient with its 7nm process (versus the 8nm in the 750G). But for all intents and purposes, both system-on-chips are equal when it comes to real-world performance.We’ve seen the Snapdragon 750G before in the Galaxy A52 5G and found it to be good enough for many uses. It’s not a gaming champ, mind you, but it can handle AI-specific and other intensive tasks well enough. While using the phone, I didn’t find the performance to be lacking for the most part. The TCL 20 Pro kept pace with the 765G-powered Pixel 5 I frequently use. In Geekbench 5, the TCL 20 Pro 5G scored 1,922 in multicore. That beats the numbers we got for the Pixel 4a 5G, which averaged 1,614. The TCL 20 Pro 5G, like the Pixel 4a 5G, struggled with the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited test, which measures graphics performance. The TCL managed an average of 6.7 frames per second — the Pixel 4a 5G similarly netted a 7 fps average.At $500, the TCL 20 Pro 5G has pretty standard performance for Android phones in this price category. But the $399 iPhone SE handily beats anything else under $500, so if performance is your only consideration, then Apple’s budget-friendly iPhone is worth looking at. With its 4,500mAh battery, I expected the TCL 20 Pro to last a good while, especially with a 60Hz display drawing less power than fast-refreshing screens. But our testing proved that to be false, much to my disappointment. While other phones with a 4,500mAh cell can last upwards of 10 hours or more, the TCL 20 Pro 5G averaged just 8 hours and 30 minutes in the Tom’s Guide battery test.Our test involves setting a phone to 150 nits of brightness and having it endlessly load webpages over a cellular connection until it kicks the bucket. All told, the TCL 20 Pro 5G’s result is extremely disappointing, putting it well behind other devices like the OnePlus 9 Pro (which also has a 4,500mAh battery). For reference, the Pixel 4a 5G with its much smaller 3,885mAh battery managed 8 hours and 12 minutes.Even so, I’m not impressed by the TCL 20 Pro 5G’s battery life, especially considering the fact that the Snapdragon 750G ought to be a power-efficient SoC. It likely comes down to software optimization — the likes of OnePlus, Samsung, and Google focus heavily on battery optimization, something not in evidence here. For charging, the TCL 20 Pro 5G supports up to 18W of wired fast charging and 15W Qi wireless charging. That 18W charging speed refills the battery from 0% to 18% in 15 minutes and 38% in 30 minutes. Compare that to the Pixel 4a 5G, which recharged to 23% in 15 minutes and 46% in 30 minutes.The TCL 20 Pro 5G comes with Android 11 out of the box with TCL UI 3.0 on top. This skin has several visual tweaks with some resemblance to Samsung’s One UI. You’re presented with a lot off features to sift through, like palm rejection adjustments, a quick launch dock for frequently used apps, an adjustable smart key to which you can map shortcuts and a few pre-installed TCL apps like the IR remote one I mentioned earlier.TCL UI does a decent job of staying out of the way while offering some nice options. For instance, the default launcher lets you choose between the traditional app drawer and iOS-style home screen app layout. But I’ve had the UI crash a few times and even experienced the whole phone crashing more than once while performing seemingly simple tasks like attempting to set up the IR remote or scrolling down a web page quickly. Beyond crashing, TCL has opted to support the 20 Pro 5G for just two years of platform and security updates (perhaps longer). That means the phone will see Android 12 at some point, plus Android 13 after that update debuts next year. Consider the fact that Samsung offers three years of support (and four years of security patches) on the Galaxy A52 5G and Google also offers three years of platform updates on the Pixel 4a 5G (and the $349 Pixel 4a). TCL’s pledge seems paltry by comparison. The TCL 20 Pro 5G wants to be so much more than a mid-range alternative to more widely known phones, and it gets close in some areas. But underwhelming battery life results and cameras that don’t quite live up to the Pixel 4a 5G hold it back, despite excellent marks in the display and design categories. For $500, this isn’t a bad phone, but it isn’t really a standout either.In comparison to the similarly-priced Galaxy A52 5G and Pixel 4a 5G, not to mention the $399 iPhone SE, the TCL 20 Pro 5G doesn’t make a compelling case for itself. The Galaxy A52 has a nice display, too, and TCL banked too much on its phone’s screen winning the day.And let’s not forget that Google, Apple, and Samsung will support their phones for longer than TCL has promised to support this one. In the case of the Pixel and the iPhone, updates are available practically the same day they’re announced.Considering that the TCL 20 Pro 5G doesn’t have much else going for it, I find it hard to recommend it over other competing phones. It’s a fine device, but not good enough to best the Galaxy A52 5G, Pixel 4a 5G, and iPhone SE."
44,OnePlus Nord N200 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-nord-n200-5g,"OS: Android 11 / OxygenOS 11 Display: 6.49-inch IPS LCD (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 90Hz CPU: Snapdragon 480 5G RAM: 4GB Storage / Expandable: 64GB / Yes Rear cameras: 13MP (f/2.2), 2MP (f/2.4) macro. 2MP (f/2.4) depth Front camera: 16MP (f/2.1) Video: Up to 1080p at 30 fps Battery: 5,000 mAh Battery life (Hrs:mins): 10:28 (90Hz), 10:36 (60Hz) Charging: 18W Colors: Blue Quantum Size: 6.42 x 2.95 x 0.33 inches Weight: 6.67 ouncesOnePlus decided to get into the budget phone space last year with the launch of the Nord series. We got the Nord N10 and the Nord N100 here in the US, but OnePlus decided that 2021 required the Nord N200 5G. All around, this is the best phone for less than $300 and one of the best 5G phones under $400.Despite some shortcomings when it comes to both performance and camera output, the Nord N200 is a good phone. It features a nice IPS LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate, a headphone jack, a big 5,000 mAh battery, and the excellent OxygenOS based on Android 11. However, OnePlus has only promised a single OS upgrade for this phone, meaning that it'll only see Android 12 which comes out in a couple of months. Budget-conscious customers will want to give the Nord N200 serious consideration for their next phone if updates don't matter to you. Seeing 5G and 90Hz on a phone this cheap is quite impressive, and it does most of what you’d want a phone to do. However, you can get better cameras with the $349 Pixel 4a and much more powerful hardware in the $399 iPhone SE (2020).Read on for our full review of the OnePlus Nord N200 5G.Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones. The OnePlus Nord N200 5G won a highly recommended award.The OnePlus Nord N200 5G comes in one variant, 64GB/4GB for $239.99. You can buy it unlocked from OnePlus. It will also be available from T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile. If you prefer a different retailer, Amazon, B&H, and Best Buy will also stock the Nord N200 for the same starting price of $239.99. The Nord N200 looks and feels like a more expensive phone. It’s got this soft-touch plastic back in a beautiful blue-ish, dark aquamarine color. The triple camera array hangs out in the top left corner, looking a bit like the module from the OnePlus 9 series. It’s nice to see some design language parity between the two product lines.Around front is the 6.49-inch LCD with the selfie cam in the top left corner. The bezels on the OnePlus Nord N200 5G are incredibly slim. The whole phone, in fact, feels quite svelte despite the large 5,000 mAh battery tucked inside.On the bottom of the phone is the USB-C port, speaker, and headphone jack. If you’re still rocking 3.5mm wired headphones or aux cables for your car, you’re in luck here. The Nord N200 comes with dual-SIM functionality, plus a micro SD card on top. I’m glad to see expandable storage here, since this phone only comes with 64GB of on-board capacity.The power button along the right side of the N200 also houses the fingerprint sensor, which is quite responsive in my experience. Some of you might prefer this to an in-display sensor found on more expensive phones since you won’t have to touch your screen to unlock your phone.For $240, I expected much less of the Nord N200, but the build quality is top-notch. The Nord N200 sports an IPS LCD panel with FHD+ resolution. It’s definitely a nice display, especially for the price, and it’s easy to use in a dark room or out in the sun. While the N200’s LCD screen lacks the true blacks of an OLED panel, most people will enjoy it when they’re looking at photos, watching videos, or playing games.One of the standout features of the Nord N200 has to be the 90Hz refresh rate on the display. There are phones that cost quite a bit more than the Nord and are stuck at 60Hz. That’s quite impressive and in real life, it makes Android buttery smooth. Scrolling on webpages or in Google Discover is a breeze and you can enjoy content at higher framerates where supported and applicable.Genshin Impact looked great on the Nord N200’s display, and other games that support high refresh rates (like Dead Cells) played well, too. The FHD+ resolution helps make text super crisp and wide color reproduction helped make some of my films pop — most notably the heavy orange scenes toward the end of Blade Runner 2049.We tested the Nord N200’s display and found that it reproduced 160.7% of the sRGB spectrum. That’s extremely good, especially with a Delta-E color accuracy rating of 0.26 (where 0 is perfect). Compare that to the $349 Pixel 4a’s OLED screen, which managed 105.8% of the sRGB spectrum with a Delta-E of 0.29.For a $240 phone, the Nord N200’s display is excellent. You lose out on some of the finer intricacies of an OLED panel, but I doubt many people will care. The Nord N200 features a triple camera setup, with a 13MP main shooter leading the charge. Along with that camera comes a 2MP macro and a 2MP depth sensor, neither of which proved useful in testing. Around front, you get a 16MP selfie cam.Although OnePlus has upped its photography game for its flagship phones, particularly the OnePlus 9 Pro, here at the low end, it’s not pretty. Compared to the Pixel 4a, which uses a single lens, the Nord N200 flounders in practically every setting. From outdoors to portrait mode, the camera performance here did not impress.Starting off outside, this photo of a bush tested both phones’ use of depth and foreground focus. They each had to capture the details of the bush while keeping everything in perspective without flattening out over overexposing the image. The Nord N200 struggled with overexposure, blowing out the final image. The Pixel 4a kept things reined in. The light levels are more even in the Pixel’s shot, and the bush is clearly in focus. At least the Nord N200 handled that part well, too.In this second outdoor image, the Nord N200 once again struggled with controlling for the bright sunlight. The flag looks washed out compared to the Pixel 4a’s more controlled tone. The flag’s colors are richer on the Pixel’s shot, and the flowers in the background pop. Looking at the Nord N200’s photo practically sears the eyes.Inside, both phones performed more alike one another. The only noticeable difference is that the Nord N200’s image is slightly warmer, giving a very slight yellowish tint. The Pixel 4a’s shot of Merida is plenty bright enough, despite it feeling subdued. The Nord N200 kept up quite well in this image.Immediately, you can see a big difference in the portrait shots from either phone. The Pixel 4a takes a zoomed-in, artistic approach to portraits and it often works well. The Nord N200 does the opposite and I think the end result suffers overall. Not only is the blur radius weak, but the image is too warm and the focus on me is too soft. I don’t like the Pixel’s much better, but it has the qualities of a decent portrait. Also, the Nord N200 seems to have done some kind of smoothing to my face, whereas the Pixel captured more facial details.Perhaps the most damning comparison yet, the Nord N200 didn’t even attempt to shoot a proper night time photo. The Pixel 4a’s Night Sight created a clear picture where you can make out the details of the smoker and it frankly looks like there’s a lot more lighting in the backyard than there actually was. The Nord N200, meanwhile, couldn’t even muster an attempt. It’s like OnePlus forgot to include a proper night mode, though even Nightscape on its higher end phones struggles to match Google’s Night Sight. Even so, this photo comparison startled me with the stark difference between the two phones.So the rear cameras on the Nord N200 are a bit of a bust, but what about the front camera? Again, the differences stand out immediately. I may be a pale individual, but the Nord N200’s photo makes me look like a ghost. There is very little detail in my face, my natural ruddiness is just obliterated by the aggressive face smoothing, and the image is, once again, too bright. The Pixel 4a, meanwhile, captured my skin tone and fine details, even showing off the green of my shirt better. In my opinion, there’s no contest here — the Pixel 4a wins hands-down.The OnePlus Nord N200 5G supports up to 1080p video recording at 30 frames per second. Those aren’t exactly stellar specs, but at least you can record FHD video on a $240 phone. In practice, the video quality produced by the N200 is just alright. The stabilization needs some work, since the final footage shows noticeable bouncing while I’m walking. The Pixel 4a, which I used in the other hand simultaneously, produced a much more stable video.Mic quality on the Nord N200 is okay, though not great. The phone’s two mics seemed to struggle to pick up my natural voice volume at half an arm’s length away. The Pixel 4a did much better and it balanced out the surrounding noises like cars and cicadas better, too. While we don’t expect mind-boggling camera performance from a $240 phone, the OnePlus Nord N200’s true disappointment comes down to its overall performance. The Snapdragon 480 5G that powers this new Nord is a good chip for its affordability, but it struggles to keep up with more intensive tasks, like gaming. And with 4GB of RAM, I found that several apps got kicked from memory, like Spotify while I was actively listening to music.This isn’t the first phone with the Snapdragon 480 5G. I just reviewed the Moto G Stylus 5G, which was similarly disappointing in terms of performance, but it costs $160 more than the Nord N200. That said, Motorola’s midrange 5G phone also has that extra 2GB of RAM, which can make a small difference in day-to-day, real-world use.Gaming on the Nord N200 requires you to drop many settings down to low or medium at best. Genshin Impact, one of the most taxing games on the Play Store, struggled to hit a reasonable frame rate. It’s not the end of the world, but don’t expect the Nord N200 to be a mobile gaming powerhouse. It’s not built for that.Of course, when it comes to performance in the sub-$500 category, we can’t forget about the iPhone SE (2020). It packs the A13 Bionic processor which absolutely stomps any Snapdragon in this price range — hell, it can go toe-to-toe with Qualcomm’s best system-on-chips. If you’re platform-agnostic, then the iPhone SE is the best option if you want the best performance for the least amount of money.In benchmarks, the Nord N200 scored 1,602 in multicore in Geekbench 5. The pricier Pixel 4a with its Snapdragon 730G scored 1,647 in multicore, while the iPhone SE managed a whopping 3,226. The SE also handily beat the Nord N200 in the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited test, where the Nord N200 managed just 5.8 frames per second. Compare that to the iPhone SE’s 47.9 fps.It’s the same story we’ve been telling since Apple surprised everyone with the iPhone SE last year. While there are comparable experiences at or below $400 in Android land, people wanting the most out of their phones ought to look to the SE. That said, phones like the Nord N200 handle most daily tasks. Other than games, the phone only really struggled with rapid photography, where I noticed lag when clicking the shutter button multiple times in quick succession.With a 5,000 mAh battery, the OnePlus Nord N200 ought to last for a long time on a charge. That’s true, though it falls short of the devices on our best phone battery life list. The 90Hz display impacts the longevity a little bit, though not as much as you might think.In the Tom’s Guide battery test, where a phone is left to reload web pages endlessly over a cellular connection until it runs out of power, the Nord N200 managed 10 hours and 28 minutes in its default 90 Hz mode. Setting the display to 60Hz improved that time to 10 hours and 36 minutes. With that in mind, you’ll get more enjoyment out of the phone if you leave it at 90Hz since it makes a negligible difference in overall battery life.Being a budget-friendly device, the Nord N200 does not feature OnePlus’ hallmark Warp Charge technology, which charges your phone blazingly fast. Instead, you get support for 18W wired charging, which got a drained N200 back to 32% after 30 minutes of charging.The Nord N200 comes with Android 11 out of the box, with OnePlus’ popular OxygenOS 11 software on top of Google’s OS. With OxygenOS, you get access to several customization options, a great default launcher, and an indescribable level of refinement. It’s basically the same software experience as the much more expensive OnePlus 9 Pro.OnePlus has said that the Nord N200 will receive a single OS upgrade, which means that this phone won't see Android 13 and beyond. I railed against Motorola for this in the Moto G Stylus 5G review and I won’t give OnePlus a pass, either. Simply put, limited software support for cheaper Android phones is bad and these companies should be ashamed.While the Nord N200 is an excellent value overall, the Pixel 4a or iPhone SE enjoy longer support (especially in the iPhone’s case). Considering that the Nord N200 will only see Android 12 later this year (plus three years of security patches, apparently), I struggle to restrain my distaste for seeing what is otherwise an excellent phone get less than a year of platform support.OnePlus hasn't even committed to three years of platform and four years of security updates for the flagship 9 series, unlike like Google and Samsung. I suppose that I can't that I'm surprised that OnePlus has chosen such a lazy update policy for the Nord N200. For $240, the OnePlus Nord N200 delivers a lot of phone — it’s also the best 5G value available in the US. That said, OnePlus’ latest has noticeable flaws, especially with its cameras. The secondary and tertiary lenses are borderline useless and the Nord N200’s main shooter struggles to not blow its photos out. The selfie cam is also just not good and video recording quality is mediocre.Performance is underwhelming and OnePlus has decided on a shoddy update schedule. Still, for $240, this phone exceeded many of my expectations going in. It looks nice, it’s built well, and it has a good display. You get sub-6GHz 5G, too. Obviously, the N200 won’t perform to the same level as more expensive phones, so I would strongly encourage you to save up the extra cash for a Pixel 4a or iPhone SE (or a Pixel 5a if that phone arrives in a few months as expected). Both phones are superior in most ways, especially the cameras, and they’ll both be supported for a while, far longer than the Nord N200 will be. The only things they lack are 5G and a 90Hz display, neither of which seem like compelling advantages for the Nord N200 in comparison.Then again, those phones cost at least $110 more than the Nord N200, so if budget is your primary concern, the Nord N200 5G is your best bet. It delivers a lot of higher-class features for less than $300 and we should applaud OnePlus for that accomplishment."
45,Realme GT,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/realme-gt,"Starting price: €449 Display: 6.4-inch FHD AMOLED (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 60Hz/120Hz (adaptive) Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.8), 8MP ultrawide (f/2.3), 2MP macro (f/2.4) Front camera: 16MP selfie (f/2.5) Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB/12GB Storage: 128GB/256GB Battery: 4,500 mAh Charging: 65W wired Operating system: Android 11 with Realme UI 2.0 Size: 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches (158.5 x 73.3 x 9.1 mm) Weight: 6.6 ounces (186 grams) Water/dust resistance: Water-resistant (no IP rating)You could easily mistake the Realme GT for a flagship phone if you just looked at the phone’s specs list. It mirrors the chipset, charging speed, and display components found in far more expensive phones like a Samsung Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9, but the GT costs far less than what you’d pay for those high-end handsets. All that’s bundled together into a compact body with a bold design.The Realme GT has some flaws, most notably lackluster cameras. But our Realme GT review finds a device that makes a claim for a spot on the best cheap phones or best gaming phones lists.The Realme GT goes on sale from June 16 in the U.K., via the Realme website and Amazon UK; and also on AliExpress from June 21. There aren't GBP prices available yet, but Realme says it costs €449 (around £390 or $543) for the basic 8GB RAM/128GB storage version. The 12GB RAM/256GB model costs €599 (around £520 or $724).Buying either version from AliExpress on June 21 gets you an early bird discount. The 8GB/128GB model will be reduced to €369  and the 12GB/256GB model to €499). UK prices are likely to be different as phone makers rarely do straight currency conversions.For comparison, the Google Pixel 4a 5G costs £499, while the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G costs £399, but those budget phones have less powerful chipsets inside. The next cheapest phone with the same Snapdragon 888 chipset I could find is the RedMagic 6, which sells for £509/$599. In other words, considering some of the prices on Snapdragon 888-powered phones, the Realme GT seems like a genuine bargain.Realme doesn't currently sell in the U.S. market, and it’s unlikely to anytime soon, given the barrier to entry facing many Chinese phone makers.The GT follows the common design formula for Android phones this year of placing a selfie camera in the left corner of a flat-edged display. The screen protrudes quite far up from the side rails, which makes me worried about how much damage even a small drop would cause. Moving to the sides, there's a power button on the right, volume buttons on the left, and a 3.5mm headphone jack, a rare thing to find on phones these days, next to the USB-C port on the bottom.The Realme GT’s Racing Yellow back is what makes the phone stand out, as does the choice of vegan leather material. The black stripe through the middle, which contains a subtle carbon-fiber-esque chevron pattern, is made of plastic however. That means it contrasts both in feel and how fingerprint-prone it is. If the yellow is too loud for you, you also have Sonic Silver and Speed Blue options, both with glass backs.Measuring 6.4 inches, the Realme GT's display isn’t as large as many of the phablets you’ll find dominating the best Android phones. I think the smaller size makes the phone more usable, but I can see where some people might hope for more screen real estate. At least the Realme GT is lightweight at just 184g (6.5 ounces). The Galaxy A52 5G, which is roughly the same size, weighs slightly more.Even if the Realme GT's display is a bit smaller than other flagships, you can't fault its other specs. The GT uses an AMOLED panel with an FHD resolution and a 120Hz max refresh rate. You can also set the refresh rate to 60Hz to save battery, or to a dynamic mode that lets the phone save battery by using 120Hz mode only when it'll benefit what's on screen.Watching Bo Burnham's ""Welcome to the Internet"", the darkness of his room looked blacker on the Realme GT but bluer on the Pixel 4a 5G’s OLED panel. Watching the more colorful Rick and Morty Season 5 trailer 3, it was harder to spot a color difference in the two phones' interpretation of the show's exaggerated and vivid art style. However the Realme GT does offer a higher maximum brightness, which was handy when I took the phone outside to continue watching video during a sunny lunch break.The rear camera array at the top of the Realme GT's black racing stripe contains three sensors. The main camera uses a 64MP sensor, while the ultrawide and macro lenses offer 8MP and 2MP, respectively.I compared the GT to the Google Pixel 4a 5G, which doesn’t attempt to challenge flagship phones, though it does have the same camera array as Google’s Pixel 5. And that device is among the best camera phones we tested.Our first photo face-off used the main cameras to take a photo of the old Keeper's Lodge in Highgate Wood. We can see a typical brighter, less saturated shot from the Realme GT's 64MP camera, which by default produces 16MP shots with the aid of pixel binning. Considering how bright the sun was on the day, the GT's shot is probably more accurate. The Pixel 4a 5G's saturated image is much more striking though.Enabling Super Nightscape mode for a low-light shot of the rose window of St. Joseph's Church, Highgate, we see how far behind Realme's night mode is compared to Google's Night Sight. The Pixel 4a 5G has captured the color and detail of the brickwork and glass far more effectively. At least the GT's image is still passable when taken on its own merits.For the ultrawide cameras, I pointed the phones at this tree stump in Highgate Wood, roughly carved into the form of a chair. Again, the Realme GT's image is a touch too bright, failing to account for how bright the sun was and losing detail because of it. That detail can be found in the Pixel's shot, though.To test the macro sensor, I swapped to the Xiaomi Mi 11, as the Pixel 4a 5G doesn’t bother with this oft superfluous sensor. Xiaomi’s phone has one of the best macro lenses we’ve tested, though, and unsurprisingly it does much better in this shot of my souvenir rivet from the Golden Gate Bridge. The macro camera on the GT requires you to get very close to focus the shot, which in turn reduces the light that you need to take an attractive shot. The telemacro sensor on the Xiaomi works from further away, meaning you get a lot more light, while the larger sensor captures more detail of the patterns within the metal and paint.Our final test is a selfie, comparing the Realme GT and the Pixel 4a 5G again. Since I'm standing in a sunny park, the Realme's shot is a bit too bright. Even though I don't always like the high level of saturation on the Pixel's image, it's the better one of the pair.It looks like the Realme GT will be the cheapest phone with a Snapdragon 888 that you can buy right now in the U.K. There's no telling how long Realme will retain this title, since there are a bevy of cheap phones on offer in India and China that could easily follow its lead, but it’s still impressive to have a phone this cheap use Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line silicon. On the Geekbench 5 app, which measures overall performance, the GT's single core score was 1,136 while its multi-core score was 3,592. That single core score actually beats the OnePlus 9 Pro, which managed 1,126 despite having 12GB RAM instead of the 8GB on our Realme test unit. The OnePlus still achieved a higher multi-core result of 3,685 however, while the category leader, the iPhone 12 Pro Max, got 1,603 and 4,111 from its best-in-class A14 Bionic chip.The GT continued strongly when tested on 3DMark’s Wild Life Unlimited graphics test, it managed 5,847 points and 35 frames per second, which are flagship-beating results. That includes the OnePlus 9 Pro (5,755 and 34.5 fps) and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (5,739 and 34.4fps). It still can't capture the Android holy grail of beating the iPhone 12 Pro Max, as Apple's mighty phone scored 9,113 and 54fps in this test.Playing Marvel Contest of Champions on the Realme GT was a real treat. There was only minimal artifacting around the characters, and the high refresh rate made watching Iron Fist mercilessly beat up Spider-Man very enjoyable. I had a try at the more graphically intensive Real Racing 3 too, and while it didn't look quite as sharp as Contest of Champions did on the GT, it still ran smoothly, with the 360Hz touch sampling rate providing rapid feedback to my taps and swipes.The GT did get quite warm while playing these games and running the tests. However thanks to the low conductivity of the vegan leather back, plus Realme's stainless steel internal cooling system, it wasn't uncomfortable to keep using.The Realme GT offers decent 5G coverage by merit of its 5G-ready chipset and a generous number of compatible bands.It only works with sub6GHz 5G, rather than the mmWave 5G on offer in some U.S. locations; that means no ultra fast 5G downloads from this phone. While there are 5G bands that match with AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Cricket,  it's not enough to make the GT worth importing over any of the other best cheap phones you can buy in the U.S. already.The Realme GT's 4,450 mAh battery is a little small for a flagship, but makes sense given the more compact frame of the phone. However it still lasted for about four and a half hours when I left it playing a 1080p YouTube video non-stop from 30% battery capacity. This strong result is likely to be thanks to its energy-efficient AMOLED panel and the dynamic refresh rate switching down to preserve power.Because it uses an identical two-part battery and wattage to the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro, I hoped the GT would match these much more expensive phones when it came to charging speed. It took just 34 minutes to fill the phone from 0% to 100%, which is nearly identical to the OnePlus 9 Pro. However unlike premium phones, the GT doesn't offer wireless charging, let alone something as fast as the 50W wireless charging that the OnePlus offers.Compared to other phones in its price bracket though, the GT leads the pack by a mile. The Pixel 4a 5G charges at a maximum of 18W, and the Galaxy A52 5G at 25W.Realme has kept things simple with realme UI 2.0, its take on Android 11. Much of the basic experience is just stock Android, although there is some unique app icon art to give the interface a unique identity. The whole UI's colors, app icons and the optional always-on display can be adjusted in terms of style and size too, if you want to make things even more your own.There are a few pre-installed apps included, such as Realme's own video, music, theme store and game space apps, and popular services like LinkedIn, Booking.com, Facebook and Netflix. It means there's a bit of tidying up to do if you want a blank canvas to organize your own apps across.I'd be happy to shortlist the Realme GT for almost any user looking for a mid-priced Android phone. The headlining features — the fast-refreshing display, the powerful chipset, and the battery system all work beautifully, while the software, 5G compatibility and looks are all suitable enough for most users. Especially if you go for a color other than bright yellow model I tested.The only people who definitely shouldn't look at the GT are camera buffs, as you will only end up disappointed by the Realme's photography. Fortunately, there's the Pixel 4a series for those users, and we’re expecting the Pixel 5a later this summer.While you lose out on high quality cameras with the Realme GT, this is otherwise a great phone for power-hungry mobile gamers, or any user who wishes they could afford the performance, display or charging speeds of our favorite Android phones. Of course, U.S. users will have to look to other devices, but if you can buy the GT, you're unlikely to regret doing so."
46,Moto G Stylus 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/moto-g-stylus-5g,"OS: Android 11 Display: 6.8-inch LCD FHD+ (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 60Hz CPU: Snapdragon 480 5G RAM: 6B Storage: 256GB Rear cameras: 48MP (f/1.7) main, 8MP (f/2.2) ultrawide, 5MP (f/2.2) macro, 2MP (f/2.4) depth Front camera: 16MP (f/2.2) Video: Up to 1080p at 60 fps Battery: 5,000mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 10:50 Charging: 10W Colors: Cosmic Emerald Size: 6.67 x 3.05 x 0.37 inches Weight: 7.67 ouncesThe Moto G Stylus 5G offers the same experience people loved about the original Moto G Stylus, but with 5G support and an improved stylus. The new model has a huge 6.8-inch FHD+ screen, 256GB of storage and a massive 5,000 mAh battery.At $399, the Moto G Stylus 5G gets things done. It’s a decent value at best, especially with its shortcomings. For one, the cameras aren’t all that great, especially when compared to what the $349 Pixel 4a produces. For another, Motorola only offers one OS upgrade and two years of security patches for the Moto G Stylus.That’s the wrong approach to updates. Just because someone chooses a budget phone doesn’t mean that they don’t deserve longer support.Putting aside those flaws,our Moto G Stylus 5G review reveals some strengths that make this a good phone.Motorola charges $399 for the Moto G Stylus 5G. The retail model comes with 256GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. You get sub-6GHz 5G and a new rounded stylus, too. The LTE-based Moto G Stylus 2021 cost $299 when it debuted earlier this year.As you might expect from a Motorola budget phone, you can buy the Moto G Stylus 5G from a lot of retailers and carriers starting June 14. The phone is available at Best Buy, Amazon, B&H Photo and Walmart. AT&T and Cricket will also offer the phone, though pricing at those carriers hasn't been announced at time of writing.The Moto G Stylus 5G looks like it should cost more than $399. It’s got a glossy finish on top of a gorgeous dark green that unfortunately proves to be a fingerprint magnet. Motorola calls the color Cosmic Emerald, and that seems fitting. Otherwise, you’ve got a slab of a phone that is quite large.Make no mistake, the 6.67 x 3.05 x 0.37-inch Moto G Stylus 5G won’t fit in some pockets, but that’s because it has a big screen, room for the stylus, and a large battery — a textbook example of tradeoffs.The design of the Moto G Stylus 5G feels surprisingly modern, with slimish bezels on the front and a hole punch cutout in the display for the selfie cam. The four rear cameras and the flash are housed in a rectangular array in the top left corner on the back of the phone. The fingerprint sensor is built into the Moto logo on the rear. Both the power button and volume rocker are placed quite high up the right side. I have large hands, and I had trouble hitting the volume up when using the Moto G Stylus 5G one-handed.The phone also comes with a headphone jack, which is nice to see these days. While many phones have moved onto the Bluetooth life, or make do with dongles and converters, Motorola seems to understand that some of its target market aren’t ready to do that.I give Motorola credit for the Moto G Stylus 5G’s design. It’s quite a looker and it doesn’t suffer from the spartan looks many budget or midrange phones often fall prey to.For $399, you shouldn’t expect a beautiful display. That said, the one on the Moto G Stylus 5G is more than acceptable. It obviously won’t win any kind of awards, but for basic media consumption, swiping through your photo gallery, and chatting over video, it does very well. At 6.8 inches, it’s quite expansive with a FHD+ resolution to make sure that your text is nice and crisp.Since this is an LCD panel, the blacks aren’t as deep as you’d find on an OLED screen and that’s readily apparent with the always-on display. There’s nothing wrong with this, but LCDs don’t benefit from dark mode battery savings like OLED panels often can.In our lab testing, the Moto G Stylus 5G managed 130.6% of the sRGB spectrum and 92.5% of the more challenging DCI-P3 gamut. Compare this to the $300 OnePlus Nord N10 5G, which also has an LCD — it managed 124.8% of the sRGB and 88.4% of the DCI-P3 gamuts. However, its Delta-E color accuracy score (where 0 is perfect) was quite high at 0.36 versus the Nord N10’s better 0.22.The Moto G Stylus 5G sports four cameras: a 48MP main, an 8MP ultrawide, a 5MP macro, and a 2MP depth sensor. While we’ve questioned the need for dedicated macro and depth cameras in the past (especially on budget phones), they’re here because Motorola thinks people want them. People are impressed by larger numbers, so including four cameras as a selling point was probably a no brainer for Motorola, even if their utility is dubious at best.I brought the Pixel 4a with me for comparison, since it’s the best photography experience for less than $400 and one of the best camera phones overall. And with its single lens, Google’s phone should be at a disadvantage to the Moto G Stylus 5G, at least on paper.That wasn’t the case in practice, though. In this first photo outside of these flowers, the Moto G Stylus 5G proved underwhelming. The Pixel 4a captured the vibrant pinkish tones of the flowers and the red of the flag, remaining quite true to life. The Moto G Stylus, meanwhile, looks somewhat oversaturated in comparison, almost like you’d see on a Samsung phone. It’s a lively photo, but some details are lost as the saturation is cranked up.In this second outdoor shot, you can see a similar thing happen again. The Moto G Stylus 5G produced a fine photo, but it went too heavy on the colors, especially with the flowers and the cardinal on the sign. We see more natural colors in the Pixel 4a’s shot, and it’s all around a better photo with better contrast.Heading inside, both phones are pretty neck and neck with this statue of Merida. However, the differences come down to brightness. The Moto G Stylus 5G went for a moodier tone, warming the shot up and keeping the exposure a bit lower. The Pixel 4a took advantage of all the copious amount of light in the room to produce a bright picture. Neither image is bad, but I like the Pixel’s effort a lot more because of its brightness and color capture.For portrait mode, neither phone did very well. The background blur is minimal at best in both the Moto G Stylus 5G’s image and the Pixel 4a’s, but the Moto gets the slightest edge in this shot. The Pixel 4a opts for a higher zoom, making it ideal for a true portrait, but the Moto’s zoomed out approach is easier to use in real life when photographing someone. It’s a matter of preference, and on higher end Pixels, the zoomed-in style tends to look better. Perhaps neither of these budget phones has the processing chops to produce a jaw-dropping portrait like the iPhone 12 or Pixel 5.In night mode, the Moto G Stylus 5G did quite well, though it didn’t quite live up to Google’s Night Sight on the Pixel 4a. The Moto’s image is also a bit noisier and the focus on the grill is softer. The Pixel’s photo is bright enough to make out details on the grill itself and is the clear winner here.The Moto G Stylus 5G has a 16MP front camera. Once again, you can see two different approaches to the final images. The Moto is way too orange, making me look like I have a bit of a tan. The green in the bushes behind me also looks weird. The Pixel 4a’s selfie is more natural-looking, matching my skin tone and the green behind much better.The Moto G Stylus 5G supports up to 1080p at 60 frames per second for video recording. I took a short clip while out for a walk and the video came out just fine. Colors looked a bit washed out and the stabilization was okay. The phone’s microphone picked up my voice and the sounds of the neighborhood around me (including the cicadas).Like the Galaxy S21, the Moto G Stylus 5G lets you record video on both the front and rear cameras at the same time. That’s a handy feature if you’re vlogging or something.Overall, recording video on the Moto G Stylus 5G is a fine experience, though it's pretty bare bones like you’d expect. However, there are plenty of editing tweaks you can play with in post, like color pop.Powered by a Snapdragon 480 5G, the Moto G Stylus 5G isn’t going to hold a candle to more expensive phones, and that’s fine. However, we shouldn’t forget about the $399 iPhone SE (2020), which is the best price-to-performance smartphone out there. Nothing in Android land at $399 comes close.But you don’t go into buying the Moto G Stylus 5G expecting a mobile powerhouse. Odds are, you want a phone that gets the basics done and on that front, the Moto G Stylus 5G succeeds. It’s fine for social media, email, web browsing, watching YouTube, and taking notes with the stylus. Just temper your expectations when it comes to gaming, because that pushes the phone for more than it’s worth.The Moto G Stylus 5G managed single-core and multicore results of 505 and 1,651, respectively, in Geekbench 5. That’s right in line with the Pixel 4a’s 551 and 1,647 results, but significantly behind the iPhone SE (2020)’s 1,337 single-core and 3,226 multicore scores.One other phone we want to mention is the $499 Pixel 4a 5G. With a Snapdragon 765G, the midrange Pixel from Google outstrips the Moto G Stylus 5G in more than just performance. For example, it scored better in Geekbench 5, with 598 in single-core and 1,614 in multicore. The 765G can handle more intensive games and AI tasks (like computational photography). While there’s a $100 difference between the two phones, it’s important to consider all of your options.While the Moto G Stylus 5G may not be a performance champ, it absolutely shines in the battery life department. With a total capacity of 5,000 mAh, Motorola says you can get just about two days of use out of that huge battery. And in our testing and use, that’s not too far off the mark.In the Tom’s Guide battery life test, where a phone is left to endlessly reload web pages over a cellular connection until it dies, the Moto G Stylus 5G scored an impressive 10 hours and 50 minutes. That doesn’t quite make the best phone battery life list, but it’s well ahead of the average smartphone. Unless you’re pushing the phone hard with lots of gaming, video chatting, and videos, you can get quite a lot of life out of it before you have to recharge.And that’s a very good thing because the Moto G Stylus 5G supports up to just 10W charging. That combined with the 5,000 mAh battery means lengthy charge times. In our testing, a drained phone reached 12% in 15 minutes and just 25% in 30 minutes. So you won’t be topping off quickly — this is one of those phones where you plug it in and forget about it for a while.The Moto G Stylus 5G comes with Android 11 out of the box, complete with Motorola’s My UX customization engine. This allows you to tweak certain parts of the user interface, like icon shapes and colors. It’s not as robust as what you’ll find on OnePlus’ OxygenOS or what’s coming in Android 12, but it’s better than what you’ll currently find on Pixels or Samsung’s One UI.Speaking of Android 12, that’s the only update this phone will ever see when Google releases that new version later this year. Essentially, that means less than a year of OS update support for the Moto G Stylus 5G. Security patches stretch to two years. The first word that springs to mind with this update promise is “pathetic.”This pales in comparison to how long Google will support the Pixel 4a, which will receive a guaranteed three years of updates and security patches. Or, look at how long Samsung will support its budget-friendly Galaxy A series: three years of OS updates and four years of security patches. And when we talk about Apple’s iPhone SE models, the disparity grows even larger. (An iPhone SE released in 2016 will still be able to use this fall’s iOS 15 update.) Motorola’s support schedule — pitiful in comparison to any of those devices — ultimately makes the Moto G Stylus 5G very difficult to recommend in my book.I understand that the platform updates aren’t the be-all-end-all, especially since Google is updating more of the core parts of Android through Play Services, but I stand firm in the belief that companies should support their devices for as long as possible. If Samsung and Google can do it, then the Lenovo-owned Motorola definitely can.But there’s more to the Moto G Stylus 5G than just its stock Android feel and platry update schedule. The stylus is why you’re probably considering this phone and Motorola delivered on its promises. It’s a comfortable stylus to hold and use, it works very well (especially in the Moto Note app), and it’s fully rounded so that you don’t have to worry about orientation when you’re re-inserting the stylus back into the phone.There’s a push button to lock and release the stylus, which just feels nice to use. Writing with the stylus on the Moto G’s screen feels very natural, and I say this as a person who hasn’t used a stylus phone since the Galaxy Note II way back when. While the Moto G Stylus 5G’s stylus isn’t as impressive as the S Pen from Samsung — there’s no Bluetooth connectivity here for additional remote features — it’s still quite functional and great for when you need to write something or want finer control than what your finger can offer.At $399 with a stylus, 5G, and a big battery, the Moto G Stylus 5G seems like a pretty good buy. And it would be, if you don’t mind the shoddy update policy and underwhelming cameras. The large display is also more than adequate. The performance leaves a lot to be desired, though that’s not a surprise given the specs.The Moto G Stylus 5G is a decent bargain at best, though you can be forgiven if you want more for your money, given the superior performance of the iPhone SE and Pixel 4a — two phones that cost as much as Motorola’s latest.If you want a stylus phone without paying Galaxy S or Note prices, this is your best bet. Motorola did a great job with the stylus experience and I found myself enjoying using it for notes or quick adjustments in photo editing. But people who want a better camera experience should turn to the budget phones from Google or Apple."
47,Moto G Power (2021),Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/moto-g-power-2021-review-the-long-lasting-battery-champ-is-back,"With the Moto G Power, Motorola has latched onto a winning formula for budget phones. Since it's impossible for a phone that costs less than $300 to be all things to all people, the key is to find a feature or two that truly matters to people and absolutely nail it. In the case of the Moto G Power, that feature is battery life.The past two iterations of this phone — the Moto G7 Power and last year's Moto G Power — delivered on the promise of a long-lasting phone. And this year's version is just as impressive. Price: $199, $249 Screen size: 6.6 inches (1600 x 720) CPU: Snapdragon 662 RAM: 3GB, 4GB Storage: 32GB, 64GB Rear cameras: 48MP (f/1.7) main; 2MP (f/2.4) macro; 2MP (f/2.4) depth Front cameras: 8MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 5,000 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 14:04 Size: 6.5 x 3 x 0.37 inches Weight: 7.3 ouncesOur Moto G Power (2021) review finds a phone that continues to go a long-time on a charge and took home top honors in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for best phone battery life. Along the way, this attractively priced phone has picked up a few other tricks that will appeal to bargain hunters.Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones. The Moto G Power (2021) won the award for best phone battery life.The 64GB Moto G Power (2021) costs $249 and is now on sale unlocked at Motorola.com; it's one of the best unlocked Android phones you can buy. Carriers offering the phone include Boost Mobile, Cricket, Consumer Cellular, Google Fi, Republic Wireless, US Cellular and Xfinity Mobile.In addition to that $249 version, which comes with 4GB of RAM, you'll be able to buy a 32GB Moto G Power (2021) with 3GB RAM for $199 at Best Buy. You can expand the storage on both new Moto G Power models via a microSD slot on the phones. Having spent some time testing the latest version of the Moto G Power, there are several things I like about the phone, including a couple of key areas where this version is a definite improvement over its predecessor. Here's why the Moto G Power (2021) is the phone to get if you're looking for the best a budget handset can offer.Phone prices have a tendency to creep upward, so it's good to see Motorola continue to hold the line on the Moto G Power's price. The 2021 costs the same as last year's model, which was one of the best cheap phones we reviewed. We can say the same for the Moto G Power (2021).Even better, Motorola has found a way to cut the price of the G Power even lower, though you will have to settle for less memory and storage. Still, a phone that promises multi-day battery life for less than $200 is well worth those compromises, particularly if you're watching your budget.Let's not beat around the bush. You turn to the Moto G Power (2021) because you want a phone that goes a long time on a charge, and with a 5,000 mAh battery, this is a phone that can deliver on that promise.How long does the Moto G Power (2021) last on a charge? So long that when we originally published our Moto G Power (2021) review, the phone was still plugging away on our battery tests, in which we have a fully charged phone surf the web continuously over cellular until it runs out of power.We run that demanding test several times and average out the result to see just what kind of battery life you can expect, and the Moto G Power (2021) doesn't disappoint. It lasted an average of 14 hours and 4 minutes, which means you can get through the day — and probably longer — without having to charge your phone.Fans of last year's Moto G Power will remember that phone lasted a record-setting 16-plus hours. But the new Moto G Power outlasted all but one other phone we've looked at in the last year and a half, and it deserves a place on our list of the longest phone battery life.Don't expect a fast recharge time with the Moto G Power. After 30 minutes of recharging a drained phone, we were back to 22% of the battery's capacity. The iPhone SE, which is not exactly a recharging speed demon thanks to its 5W charger, got back to 29% in that time.You don't expect a $249 phone to look like a million bucks, but while the 7.3-ounce Moto G Power feels, a little chunky, Motorola clearly put some effort into giving this phone a look that transcends its budget roots. The flash gray model I tested has a lovely spiral pattern on its back, and I like the centered placement of the rear camera array just above the subtle Motorola batwing logo. (Retail versions of the phone will come in Polar Silver and Glowing Blue options.)Bezels on the front of the phone are minimal thanks to a circular camera cutout on the upper left corner of the display and the lack of a fingerprint sensor. Instead, the power button on the new Moto phone does double duty, with a built-in fingerprint reader that I found responsive in my testing. Motorola also added a Moto Action that lets you launch apps by tapping the power button twice. (You will need to enable this feature first, though in the Moto G Power's Settings app.)The Moto G Power (2021) also retains a 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of the phone, so you won't be forced to pick up a pair of wireless earbuds in addition to your new device.The $349 Pixel 4a proves that you don't have to spend big bucks to get a phone that produces outstanding photos, which puts pressure on lower-cost devices like the Moto G series to up their camera game. Motorola responded by turning to a more powerful lens with this year's version of the Moto G Power — you've got a 48MP camera compared to the 16GB main shooter on last year's phone. A 2MP macro lens and 2MP depth sensor join that main camera.The results are a mixed bag, with the Moto G Power (2021) producing very good shots in some areas, while falling short in others. The Pixel 4a produces much better shots, but it also costs $100 more than the Moto G Power. For what you're paying for Motorola's, the resulting photos are more than adequate.In some cases, the Moto G Power really shines, particularly when it comes to those extra rear lenses. I'm no fan of macro lenses — I'd prefer that budget phone makers scrap them entirely, actually — but if every macro lens performed as well as the Moto G Power's did, I'd rethink my position. This close-up of a camellia produces bright colors I find lacking from the OnePlus Nord N10 5G's much darker effort.Similarly, the Moto G Power's depth sensor produces some nice portrait shots for a sub-$300 phone. The Moto G Power did an excellent job making my daughter stand out from the orange tree behind her, making sure not to lose her hair in the background. The Nord N10 loses some detail just over her left shoulder, though I think the OnePlus camera better captures her gray beret. Overall, though, the Moto G Power has the more effective background blur.Things are less impressive when you rely on the Moto G Power's main lens, which produced an accurate shot of this plate of lasagna, but one that pales next to the warmer colors that the Nord N10 5G reproduces. The table in the Moto shot is more washed out, and the glass of wine in the background lacks any hint of red. I know which photo I'd be more likely to share, and it's not the one the Moto G Power took.Even lower cost phones offer low-light photo features now, and the Moto G Power is no exception with its Night Vision mode. The results will do in a pinch, though it falls well short of the standard set by Google's Night Sight. (In this comparison, I used a Pixel 4a 5G, as it was the least expensive Google phone I had on hand.) You can see the pink stuffed animal and the bowl of citrus fruit that might otherwise be lost in the shadow of this shot, but the focus of the photo isn't exactly sharp. The over-processing on the photo also washes out some of the detail of the back wall, which is not a problem in the Pixel photo.Up front, you get an 8MP selfie cam on the Moto G Power (2021). It takes decent self-portraits — I like the more colorful cast to the Moto shot — but Motorola gets overly aggressive with the face-smoothing. As a result, my face has an unnatural cast to it in the Moto G Power selfie, while the OnePlus Nord N10 provides a more accurate view of my mug, flaws and all.Motorola's well-deserved reputation for producing a clean version of Android for its phones continues with this year's Moto G series. And Motorola's gesture-based shortcuts are back, letting you do things like turn on the phone's flashlight with a chopping motion.A new Moto gesture is bound to impress some Moto G Power users — dragging your finger back and forth across the phone's display triggers a split-screen effect so you can run two apps at once. It should come in handy if you want to watch a video while texting a friend, or tap out some notes while reading a web page.As impressive as Motorola's new phone is in all those areas, I did encounter a few flaws in testing for my Moto G Power (2021) review. The biggest areas of concern are the phone's display — it's a bit dim and the picture isn't always the most colorful — and a processor that doesn't deliver the best performance compared to other low-cost phones.The 6.6-inch LCD panel that Motorola uses for the G Power's display is certainly big enough, but don't expect bold colors or a bright view. In our tests, the Moto G Power reproduced 96% of the sRGB color spectrum, and that was in saturated mode. The OnePlus N10 5G, in contrast, has the more colorful screen with 124.8% of the same spectrum. OnePlus' display was more accurate, too, with a Delta-E rating of 0.22. The Moto G Power (2021) turned in a 0.37 rating in saturated mode, which improved to 0.25 when we switched to natural mode. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)The raw numbers were reflected by my viewing experience with the Moto G Power. The darker scenes in the No Time to Die trailer looked especially dark, with Daniel Craig and Lashana Lynch nearly lost in shadow at times. Things were brighter when streaming The Simpsons on Disney Plus, thanks to that animated show's more cartoony color scheme — the Simpsons themselves were a recognizable shade of yellow while Krusty the Clown's hair was its usual shade of bluish-green.I've seen brighter displays than what the Moto G Power offers, as it topped out at 438 nits when we measured with a light meter. Last year's Moto G Power hit 500 nits, so this is a step back, especially when you compare it to phones like the iPhone SE (653 nits) and Pixel 4a (638 nits). At least the Moto G Power outshines the OnePlus Nord N10 5G (405.7) and TCL 10 5G UW (385 nits), and maxing out the display brightness helped me see the screen outdoors.You're not going to pick up the Moto G Power if you want the latest and greatest processor, and the Snapdragon 662 chipset powering the phone is certainly adequate for most tasks. I never had a problem jumping between apps, streaming videos and even playing demanding games, though I've seen sharper graphics in PUBG Mobile sessions on other phones.That said, the Moto G Power's benchmark scores are a little anemic when compared to phones that are only slightly more expensive. On Geekbench 5, the Moto G Power's multicore score of 1,437 trailed the Nord N10's result of 1,843. In graphics testing with 3DMark's Wild Life benchmark, the Moto G Power recorded 367 frames, or 2.2 frames per second. The OnePlus Nord N10 managed to more than double that result.The Snapdragon 662 chipset in the Moto G Power also means that the phone tops out with LTE connectivity — there's no 5G to be found here. I don't think this is a show-stopping omission by any means, given that 5G is still an emerging technology and not yet ubiquitous. But prices of 5G phones are falling — the OnePlus Nord N10 5G is just $50 more than the Moto G Power — so the ""you have to pay up for 5G"" excuse doesn't hold as much water as it did a year ago.You're probably safe on skipping 5G compatibility if you're upgrading phones this year. But networks are going to continue evolving, and if you're the sort who holds onto a device for two years or longer, you'll be giving up that improving performance. (That said, LTE speeds are likely to improve as 5G becomes widespread, as the faster network will help ease congested 4G traffic.)One trade-off you make by buying a lower cost Android is that the phone maker will only offer a limited number of software updates. That's also the case with the Moto G Power (2021), as Motorola is committing to supporting just one Android update, along with two years of security patches.The lone Android update stings a lot more than it normally would, as the Moto G Power ships with Android 10 installed, and not Android 11, which came out in September. That means once your phone gets the Android 11 update, that's it — even with Android 12 coming down the pike later this year.Any sub-$300 phone is going to involve some compromises, and fortunately, the ones that the latest version of the Moto G Power makes aren't going to put many budget shoppers off. Yes, there are more powerful phones with better displays that don't cost that much more than the Moto G Power (2021). But the long-battery life of Motorola's phone continues to carry the day, especially for a phone that you can find for $250 or less.The cameras on the Moto G Power aren't world-beaters, but it'll produce good shots. And I actually like the look and feel of this phone — a surprise given the G Power's budget roots. Still, the reason to consider past Moto G Power models was its epic battery life, and I'm happy to report that continues with the 2021 edition of this popular budget phone."
48,OnePlus 9,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-9,"Starting price: $729 Screen size: 6.55-inch AMOLED (2400 x 1080; 120Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB, 12GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 48MP main (f/1.8); 50MP ultrawide (f/2.2); 2MP monochrome Front cameras: 16MP (f/2.4) Battery size: 4,500 mAh Battery life (Hrs: Mins): 10:51 (120Hz); 10:53 (60Hz) Charging speed: 65W, wired; 15W, wireless Size: 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.32 inches Weight: 6.77 ouncesThe OnePlus 9 Pro may be the premium choice for Android lovers, but don't overlook the OnePlus 9. The less expensive version of the new OnePlus flagship may lack some of the higher-end features of its sibling, such as a dynamically adjusting display, a telephoto lens and fast wireless charging, but the OnePlus 9 offers enough at a lower price to compete against some of the best Android phones out there.The OnePlus 9 offers the features you've come to expect from OnePlus: solid battery life, fast charging and outstanding performance. But this latest phone goes a long way toward addressing a longtime Achilles' heel for OnePlus, because it improves  the quality of photos produced by the rear cameras.In our OnePlus 9 review, we'll look at what's improved in this latest phone from OnePlus and whether it's enough to make this handset the next Android device you buy.The OnePlus 9 starts at $729 for a 128GB model. That's $240 less than the OnePlus 9 Pro launching at the same time. More importantly, it's $70 cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S21, which also features 128GB of storage, and the iPhone 12, which offers a meager 64GB. OnePlus' reputation as the phone maker that can beat the high price of flagship devices is secure, at least with this phone. OnePlus told there would be a 256GB version of the OnePlus 9 will cost $100 more, but so far, only the 128GB model appears on OnePlus' site, where you can buy the phone unlocked. (And why not? The OnePlus 9 is the best unlocked Android phone by our calculations.) The phone costs €699 and €799 in Europe for the 128GB and 256GB versions, respectively.The OnePlus 9 shipped in April, you can buy it at Amazon, Best Buy and B&H Photo, as well as from OnePlus. If you prefer to buy your phones directly from wireless providers, T-Mobile also offers the OnePlus 9.There's a noticeable design difference between the regular OnePlus 9 and the Pro model. While the latter phone has a curved display — though not as curved as last year's OnePlus 8 Pro — the OnePlus 9 sticks with a flat-edge panel. Frankly, I prefer the 9's approach, as it makes the 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.32-inch phone easier to hold and there's little chance of accidental screen touches.Unlike the OnePlus 8, which placed its rear cameras in a descending line down the middle of the phone, the OnePlus 9 follows the lead of the OnePlus 8T with a rectangular camera array in the upper left corner of the phone. The camera bump feels pretty pronounced — so much so that when you lay the OnePlus 9 on its back, you'll get a little wobble if you press down on the phone.As with many of its other flagships, you won't get an IP rating for dust and water resistance with the OnePlus 9. That's reserved for the OnePlus 9 Pro version sold through T-Mobile. You also won't find a microSD slot on the OnePlus 9 for expanding the phone's storage.My OnePlus 9 review unit came in Astral Black, which places a layer of matte-black film beneath glossy glass. OnePlus says the effect reduces fingerprints, and while I did notice a smudge or two on my phone, the OnePlus 9 is certainly nowhere near as much of a fingerprint magnet as other phones I've tested recently.That said, I would have preferred to see the OnePlus 9 in Winter Mist, the other color option available in North America. That purple-ish phone features a refraction effect that I imagine is more eye-catching than a black matte phone, particularly in sunlight.As with last year's OnePlus models, the OnePlus 9 features an in-display fingerprint sensor for unlocking the phone, with a handy fingerprint outline showing you where to press. It sometimes takes a couple of touches for the OnePlus 9 to recognize my fingerprint, though perhaps that will improve as I spend more time with the phone. Better to take advantage of the OnePlus 9's ability to detect your face and unlock your phone, though this facial recognition feature isn't secure enough to confirm mobile payments.It's not the marvel that the OnePlus 9 Pro display is, but the OnePlus 9's 6.55-inch screen still impresses with its bright AMOLED panel. You'll enjoy a 120Hz refresh rate, a step up from the 90Hz refresh rate of the OnePlus 8, though not the dynamically adjusting display that the OnePlus 9 Pro features. Still, that 120Hz display is great when you're scrolling through web pages, and as we'll see when we discuss the OnePlus 9's battery life, leaving the fast refresh rate turned on doesn't drain the battery.I found the OnePlus 9 screen to be plenty bright, with a light meter reading of 696 nits with adaptive brightness turned on. That's a touch dimmer than the Galaxy S21 (711 nits), though it beats the iPhone 12's 569-nit reading. I had no problem seeing the OnePlus 9 screen outdoors in bright sunshine, though it's easier to navigate with the brightness cranked up all the way.Colors look accurate on the OnePlus 9 screen, whether it's the grim, dreary world of Scranton paper pushers in The Office streaming on Peacock or the more vibrant scenery in the fictional country of Zamunda in a Coming 2 America trailer on YouTube. When I was streaming on Peacock, I noticed that the picture didn't stretch to fill the entire OnePlus 9 screen, but that wasn't a problem with YouTube, where the familiar faces of Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall filled up a frame that went right to the OnePlus 9's minimal top bezel.In its Vivid setting, the OnePlus 9 screen recreates 199.4% of the sRGB color spectrum, a number that drops to 104.1% when you adjust the display to Natural. That's in line with the 109.2% that the Galaxy S21 shows off. Whether you opt for Vivid or Natural, the OnePlus 9 screen renders colors fairly accurately with Delta-E scores of 0.28 and 0.27, respectively. Both scores are slightly better than the 0.29 Delta-E ratings for the iPhone 12 and Galaxy S21. (The closer the rating is to zero, the more accurate the colors.)If there's been one common weakness among OnePlus' recent flagships, it's the camera performance. It's not that OnePlus doesn't make perfectly fine cameras, but when stacked up against the best camera phones, OnePlus' pictures don't look as sharp or as colorful.Enter famed camera maker Hasselblad to change all that. OnePlus has inked a deal with the Swedish firm aimed at improving the cameras on its phones, and the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro are the first models to benefit. The initial effort focuses on natural color calibration, with OnePlus promising natural, rich colors in photos shot by its 9-series phones. There are other tweaks as well, including a distinctive shutter sound and orange shutter button familiar to anyone who's used a Hasselblad camera.The focus may be on software, but OnePlus isn't ignoring the hardware side of things. The OnePlus 9 comes with a 48MP main camera and a 50MP ultrawide angle lens, the latter of which features a freeform lens aimed at reducing the distortion you can find at the edge of wide-angle shots. There's also a dedicated monochrome camera, which, frankly, I wish OnePlus would have left on the drawing board. You won't get a telephoto lens with the OnePlus 9 — that requires an upgrade to the OnePlus 9 Pro.The very first shot I took with the OnePlus 9 left me wondering whether the promised color calibration was all that it's cracked up to be. This plate of scrambled eggs looks ghostly pale in the OnePlus 9 shot — even the chipotle salsa on top of the eggs seems muted. The iPhone 12's photo doesn't have that problem, and you can see the yellow of the eggs alongside the other multitude of colors from the vegetables. Even the gray mushrooms have some pop in the iPhone pic.We see a similar issue in this photo of a marquee outside a restaurant, taken with both the OnePlus 9 and the Pixel 4a 5G. (Yes, the Pixel 4a 5G is a midrange phone, but it's got the same cameras as the higher-end Pixel 5, so the comparison is apt.) The OnePlus 9 shot looks all right until you compare it to the Pixel's. Google's phone successfully distinguishes the blue and green neon surrounding the marquee, and you can see a patch of blue sky in the upper left corner. OnePlus' cameras washed out the sky.Fortunately, the OnePlus 9's struggles with color were only sporadic. There's nothing wrong with this shot of a bowl of fruit. Yes, the iPhone 12 offers more vibrant colors and the red apple in the foreground comes into sharper focus. But the colors in the OnePlus 9 shot are very natural, and I'd be pleased to share this photo.Moving outside to a Sonoma County pond, we see that the OnePlus 9 once again tackles color with skill, balancing the greens, blues and yellows in this shot. My daughter — the subject of the photo — prefers the OnePlus 9 photo because it has a dreamier cast to it, while I like the detail that the iPhone 12 captures in the ripples on the pond. You can't go wrong with either photo, though.Testing out the ultrawide angle lens, there's a very slight bend to the trees on the right side of the iPhone picture, but you really have to look to notice it. More obvious is the difference in color — the iPhone 12 really offers a deep blue for the sky, and the vegetation growing pondside has a vibrancy lacking from the OnePlus 9. That said, I think the OnePlus 9 picture is perfectly acceptable, and it captures slightly more area than the iPhone's ultrawide angle lens does. That's handy for sweeping vistas.As noted, there's no telephoto lens on the OnePlus 9, so you're relying on a digital zoom when you want to get closer to a shot. Fortunately, the software on the OnePlus 9 is up to the task for this photo of a drinking fountain erected by the Women's Temperance Union. (No, really.) You can clearly make out the text of the rather extremist messaging — I came here to get a drink of water, not a lecture, folks — and the OnePlus 9 actually does a better job of balancing sunlight and shadow than the iPhone 12 did on its zoom.For low-light photography, I put the OnePlus 9 up against the Pixel 4a 5G, since Google's phones are a leader in this area, and I think the new OnePlus phone held its own. OnePlus clearly puts the focus on getting the colors right in this shot that's lit only by overhead LEDs and a solar lamp in the background. The stuffed animal is really as pink as it appears in the OnePlus photo, while the Pixel mutes that particular color a bit. The Pixel does a better job capturing more detail like the texture of the brick wall in the background, and it keeps the animals in sharper focus. But this is about as close to a push as you can get, which is good news, given OnePlus' track record in this area.Which portrait shot you prefer depends on whether you prefer up-close-and-personal photos like the one the OnePlus 9 produces or images with more background, as seen in the iPhone 12 shot. I think the iPhone 12 is better at separating my daughter from the tree behind her, while the OnePlus photo gives you a better view of her face. Again, this is an instance where OnePlus holds its own against a well-regarded camera phone.The OnePlus 9 has some specific camera features worth calling out, starting with its 2MP monochrome camera. By opting for the mono filter, you can get a true black-and-white shot, like this photo where I've drained all the color out of a field of periwinkle flowers. At least the monochrome lens doesn't wash out the shadows, and the finished product delivers the black-and-white image promised. I'm just at a loss as to whether I'd use this feature enough to merit a dedicated lens. I was far more impressed by the tilt-shift mode OnePlus includes in its camera app. Enable Tilt Shift and you can use selective focus to draw attention to a particular part of the image. This brick wall that I photographed wouldn't look very interesting as a regular photo, but the intentional blurs in the tilt-shifted shot produce a rather artistic view.I'm not enamored with the 16MP front camera on the OnePlus 9. In this portrait shot, the OnePlus 9 lightened my face a little too much, whereas the Pixel 4a 5G didn't have as much trouble with the sunlight being cast on me. The A's logo in the Pixel photo is also sharper, and there's less over-exposure around my cap. Like the OnePlus 9 Pro, the OnePlus 9 is powered by the Snapdragon 888, the latest and greatest system-on-a-chip from Qualcomm. While it figures to find its way into most of the top Android phones later this year, the Snapdragon 888 is only in a handful of phones right now, such as Samsung's Galaxy S21 lineup and the new ROG Phone 5 gaming handset from Asus. As a result, the OnePlus 9's performance can match — and even beat — the top Android phones.Running the Geekbench 5 test for general performance, the OnePlus 9 turned in a multicore result of 3,618. That's in the same ballpark as the OnePlus 9 Pro's 3,685 result — no surprise since the phones are running on the same chipset. The OnePlus 9 also kept pace with the ROG Phone 5 (3,672) while handily outperforming the Galaxy S21 (3,302). You can expect top performance from the OnePlus 9, thanks to not only the phone's Snapdragon 888 silicon, but also the 8GB or 12GB of RAM OnePlus includes in the different configurations of the devices.In 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited test, the OnePlus 9 turned in a result of 5,726, or 34.4 frames per second. That essentially matches the graphics performance of the ROG Phone 5, which hit 34.8 FPS on that same test. Considering that the ROG Phone 5 is specifically marketed as a gaming device, you can enjoy a similar experience with demanding games on the OnePlus 9, as I discovered when playing PUBG Mobile on the OnePlus handset. The game never stuttered, even during some pretty intense fire-fights, and graphics looked sharp, save for a few trees that looked a little janky when I sped by in a jeep.Another aspect of the OnePlus 9 that's sure to appeal to gamers is the phone's stereo speakers. Because the speakers are front-firing, you don't cover them up with your hands when holding the OnePlus 9 in landscape orientation, so you can hear every last sound from your game. And these speakers are loud — so much so that when I was playing a game, my wife shut the door on me so that she wouldn't have to listen to the carnage from the other room.As good as the OnePlus 9 and its Snapdragon 888 chipset is, it's still no match for the iPhone 12 and its A14 Bionic processor, which turned in better Geekbench (3,859) and Wild Life (39 FPS) scores. In our real-world test in which we have phones transcode a 4K video using Adobe Premiere Rush, the OnePlus 9 completed the task in 1 minute and 2 seconds. That's good for an Android phone — the Galaxy S21 took a second longer — but it's nowhere near the 26 seconds it takes the iPhone to transcode that same video.The Snapdragon 888 silicon includes Qualcomm's integrated X60 5G modem. You'll have no problem connecting with T-Mobile's 5G network, whether you buy your phone directly from the carrier or pick up an unlocked version. An unlocked OnePlus 9 will only work with the LTE networks of AT&T, though.As for Verizon, it's a little bit complicated. After we initially published our OnePlus 9 review, Verizon and OnePlus announced that the phone was certified to work on Verizon's 5G network. (We figured it would — the OnePlus 9 lists the necessary bands for compatibility with Verizon 5G.) However, that apparently ensures compatibility with just Verizon's slower, nationwide 5G; access to the faster Ultra Wideband network is reserved for the OnePlus 9 Pro.Don't expect life-changing speeds from 5G at this point, though that's more a reflection of the state of 5G networks than any issue with the OnePlus 9. On T-Mobile's 5G network not far from my Bay Area house, the OnePlus 9 hit a download speed of 34.4 Mbps. My iPhone 11 Pro Max, connecting to Verizon LTE, reached 86 Mbps in that same spot. Adjust your 5G expectations accordingly.One area in which OnePlus can indisputably teach other phone makers a thing or two concerns the phone's battery. OnePlus not only builds devices that typically last a long time, it also boasts the fastest charging speeds of any phone maker.In terms of battery life, the OnePlus 8T was a bit of an outlier for OnePlus. It turned in only an average time for smartphones on our battery test, which involves setting a device to continuously surf the web over a cellular connection until it runs out of power. The OnePlus 9 rebounds quite nicely on our test, lasting for 10 hours and 51 minutes. That's not quite long enough to land on our best phone battery life list, where you have to hold out for 11 hours or more, but it's still an excellent time.Even better, the OnePlus lasted just shy of 11 hours with its screen set at a 120Hz refresh rate. When we've tested other phones that offer fast-refreshing displays, we've noticed that the feature puts a serious hit on battery life. The Galaxy S21 lasts 6.5 hours when its adaptive display is enabled, for example — more than three hours shorter than when we set Samsung phone's screen to refresh at 60Hz. OnePlus should be congratulated for delivering a fast-refreshing screen without compromising on battery life.We also tested the OnePlus 9 with its screen refresh rate set to 60Hz. That improved battery life by... 2 minutes, with the phone holding out for 9 hours, 53 minutes in our test. Essentially, you can keep the OnePlus 9's screen set at 120Hz without having to worry about any meaningful impact on battery life.It's in charging up the OnePlus 9's dual-cell 4,500 mAh battery where OnePlus really sets the standard. The phone supports OnePlus WarpCharge 65T technology, which allows the device to charge at a higher wattage for a longer period. The result? OnePlus says phones that support WarpCharge 65T can go from 0 to fully charged in 29 minutes. That's 9 minutes faster than the OnePlus 8T.Our testing didn't quite hit that speed, though it came awfully close. After 30 minutes of charging, our OnePlus 9's battery was at 98%. The Galaxy S21 only got up to 55% after half-an-hour, and Samsung's phone doesn't come with a charger like the OnePlus 9 does.You can also wirelessly charge the OnePlus 9, with the phone supporting 15W charging with Qi-compatible charging pads.The Oxygen OS that OnePlus uses on its phones isn't the purest form of Android, but it's a reasonable take on the operating system that offers valuable add-ons without much in the way of bloat. OnePlus does include a folder of its own apps with the OnePlus 9, but these are generally useful tools for migrating data from another phone or connecting to the OnePlus community. There's no duplicate features here like there are on other Android phones.The biggest addition with Oxygen OS 11, which is built on Android 11, involves the latest version of the Turbo Boost memory-optimization feature. OnePlus says Turbo Boost 3.0 uses RAM compression and virtual RAM to let you keep 25% more apps open in the background than before. I can't quantify that exact figure, though switching between apps on the OnePlus 9 feels snappy.You can expect two major Android updates plus three years of security patches from OnePlus. That's a level of support befitting a flagship phone, even if Samsung outdoes OnePlus by offering an additional Android update and an extra year of security patches.Until now, the biggest argument against OnePlus' phones has been the camera performance. While some inconsistencies remain, our OnePlus 9 review found that the new phone performs much better in that department when compared to the leading flagships. You'd still favor photos from the likes of the iPhone or the Google Pixel, but OnePlus is at least now in the conversation.Those improved cameras means that the OnePlus 9 should also be in the conversation if you're wondering which phone to get. Not only is the OnePlus 9 cheaper than the Galaxy S21, it also outperforms that phone. In fact, you can even expect performance on par with the ROG Phone 5, making this an affordable option for gamers. And the fast-charging, long-lasting battery on the OnePlus phones continues to impress.If you've been unsure about whether OnePlus is worth a gamble over devices from more established phone makers, let the OnePlus 9 be your assurance that this phone can hold its own against any Android device."

See our full OnePlus 9 review and OnePlus 9 Pro review. The OnePlus 8T, despite having an amazing foundation, never quite made it to the best Android phones. If you want a OnePlus phone that gets our seal or approval, then check out our review of the OnePlus 9. But the OnePlus 8T is far from a bad phone, in fact it's rather good, as a successor to the OnePlus 8.  It gets a super-smooth 120Hz display and four rear cameras, as well as a smart dual battery fast-charging system.There’s only one version of the OnePlus 8T available in the U.S. and it's the model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It's been available to buy since October 23 2020.The beefy U.S. spec, which is variable in Aquamarine Green and Luna Silver colors, will set you back $749. That makes the 8T $50 more expensive than the OnePlus 8, which started at $699 but had less RAM and storage. In the U.K. the Lunar Silver model is only available with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but costs £549. The Aquamarine Green only comes with the higher spec and costs £649. Both went on sale on October 20. At this price, though, the higher-spec OnePlus 8T still pushes the upper end of the mid-range phone arena. That’s both a good and bad place to be in. As many phones have hit or surpassed the $1,000 marker, there aren’t a great deal that offer a suite of flagship specs or standout features for a sub-$800 price. However, the competition that’s there is stiff indeed. The $699 Samsung Galaxy S20 FE offers a serious mix of flagship specs, with only a few compromises in the form of a plastic back and less RAM than the 8T. The $699 Google Pixel 5 also undercuts the 8T, but compromises on both refresh rate and processing power, though it offers stellar photography performance instead. Over in the U.K., the entry-level OnePlus 8T offers superior specs to both the £599 Pixel 5 and Galaxy S20 FE. so it's arguably a more competitive handset on Britain’s side of the Atlantic. But this was once a price point where OnePlus mostly stood alone; now it’s got to face down two phones that have very appealing features.  So the OnePlus 8T has its work cut out if it wants to beat similarly priced phones. And it’s worth noting that the OnePlus Nord offers a lot of phone for £379, roughly $490, even if it’s not as powerful on paper, and isn't available in places like the U.S. Speaking of the OnePlus Nord, the OnePlus 8T looks a lot like OnePlus’ budget device. Both phones sport a neat rounded rectangular design with displays that are flat, not curved like the edges on the OnePlus 8’s display. This makes the 8T a lot easier to grip, if not as aesthetically pleasing. The OnePlus 8T is a little larger than the Nord and the OnePlus 8, measuring 6.32 x  2.91 x 0.33 inches and weighing 6.6 ounces. With its glass back and premium finish the 8T feels more like a flagship phone than the Pixel 5 with its aluminium back. This has long been a strong part of OnePlus phones and while you might not be getting a true flagship phone, the 8T certainly has that high-level of build quality and finish that feel more in line with $1,000 handsets. And whatever treatment OnePlus has given the 8T, its back is pretty resistant to fingerprints, which makes a pleasant contrast to some phones.There’s no IP68 water and dust resistance rating here, something that’s expected in a lot of flagship phones but a feature that OnePlus has shunned for years. In practical terms, that doesn't matter a great deal as OnePlus has used various seals to keep water out of its handsets, meaning that they’ll survive a quick drop into a sink or a drenching from a sudden downpour. That doesn't mean I’d advocate dropping a OnePlus 8T into a pint on a regular basis.  The biggest change the OnePlus 8T brings to the table is its rather prominent rear camera module that houses four cameras and a flash in a rounded rectangle unit positioned in the top right-hand side. That’s a significant change from the OnePlus 8’s pill-shaped trio of cameras that sat in the top middle section of the handset. I prefer the older design for its neatness. But chunky rear camera modules are en vogue in 2020, and the OnePlus 8T’s module is hardly the most offensive. And it’s positioned in a spot that means you’re less likely to hit it with your fingers when snapping a photo in haste.  With only silver and green for color options, the OnePlus 8 doesn't exactly have a broad range of finishes to choose from. While I’d have liked to have seen the striking blue hues of the OnePlus 7T return, I think both the Aquamarine Green and Lunar Silver colors are rather attractive.Recent OnePlus phones have offered impressive displays, and the OnePlus 8T keeps up with that tradition. It’s a 6.55-inch display with 2400 x 1080 resolution. More importantly, it features a super-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, which makes the OnePlus 8T a joy to use. High refresh-rate displays are becoming more prolific, even if phones like the Pixel 5 stick with 90Hz rather than 120Hz. Use such phones for any length of time and you could find it very hard to go back to a conventional 60Hz screen. I switched the OnePlus 8T out of its 120Hz mode and immediately regretted it, as scrolling through menus and webpages felt rather jarring after the smoothness of 120Hz.I’m less convinced by a jump from 90Hz to 120Hz. Comparing the OnePlus 8T to the OnePlus 7T Pro’s 90hz display, the difference in smoothness wasn’t vast, so don’t expect it to feel like a huge upgrade. At 1080p the OnePlus 8T’s display isn’t as sharp as other phones with 6.5-inch displays and above. But you’ll only really notice the difference between a 1080p and 1440p panel if you really zoom into photos. And with a pixel per inch density of 402, the difference in sharpness between the 8T’s panel and those of flagship phones is negligible. With an OLED panel that supports HDR, the OnePlus 8T handles colors and contrast rather well. In our tests, its default “vivid” mode covered 169.9% of the sRGB color gamut and 120.2% of the DCI-P3 color space. That beats the results we got for the OnePlus 8 Pro, but lagged a little behind the Galaxy S20 FE in DCI-P3 coverage, with Samsung’s phone hitting 133.3%.  As for color accuracy, the OnePlus 8T managed a Delta-E score of 0.29 in our lab tests (the lower the score the better), which beats the S20 FE’s score of 0.3. Drop the OnePlus 8T into its “natural” screen calibration and colors become more accurate delivering a Delta-E score of 0.22, at the expense of lesser color gamut coverage. Everything on Netflix, from The Witcher’s varied color pallet to the vivid hues of comedy spy animation Archer, looks excellent on the OnePlus 8T’s display. So do YouTube videos with the frenetic action of the James Bond No Time To Die trailer showing how well the display can pick out detail in both dimly lit scenes and those saturated with color. It’s up there with some of the best smartphone displays, perhaps only being edged out by the stellar displays on phones like the Oppo Find X2 Pro. It helps that display gets rather bright, hitting a peak of 678 nits with the adaptive brightness on. That's up there with the S20 FE and other 2020 Samsung phones, but it’s beaten by the iPhone 11 Pro's 752 nits. Still, the OnePlus 8T’s display is an upgrade over the OnePlus 8’s panel, just not a huge one. For its rear camera array the OnePlus 8T takes the 48MP main and 16MP ultra wide-angle cameras of the OnePlus 8 and adds in a 5MP macro camera and 2MP monochrome camera. There’s no telephoto lens in the mix, like the one you find on the OnePlus 8 Pro or Galaxy S20 FE. The omission is also a little odd given last year’s OnePlus 7T came with a 12MP 3x telephoto camera. Still, with four cameras on offer and OnePlus having shown it can produce a smartphone with flagship-grade cameras with the OnePlus 8 Pro, my expectations were rather high for the 8T. Sadly, they weren’t met. Photos taken with the main camera were in the same ballpark as those of other Android flagships. But the performance of the other lenses fell flat. It's worth noting that since we first reviewed the 8T, OnePlus has put out a suite of updates that have improved the camera performance, But sadly, the shots we pick through below are still representative of the phone's photography skills. Overall, it's decent but can't quite justify it high price in the face of strong rivals. Compared to the new Pixel 5, the 8T’s 48MP main camera holds its own. It snaps shots that are then resolved down to 12MP photos using a tried-and-tested pixel binning technique. In the below shot of a damp London park and cloud-studded sky, you can see the 8T offers a brighter and more vibrant shot than the Pixel 5. But Google’s new phone captures more true-to-life colors with more dynamic range. Zoom in to the tower blocks or Canary Wharf in the background, and you can see the Pixel 5 offers a little more detail.  Like the recent OnePlus phones with 48MP main cameras, there’s the option to capture pure 48MP photos. Unsurprisingly, the 48MP mode produces shots with more detail when you zoom into them, but the difference isn’t profound. There are differences in color and brightness, but neither shot is particularly true to life. Given the OnePlus 8T has the same Sony IMX586 sensor in the 48MP camera as the OnePlus 7T Pro, it’s worth seeing if the 8T offers a decent upgrade over the older phone. There's not a great deal of difference on display in standard point-and-shoot shots. The 8T offers brighter and more vibrant compositions, with more dynamic range and a little more detail when zoomed in. Despite having a dedicated macro camera, the lack of a telephoto lens on the OnePlus 8T means getting very close to a subject to use the super macro mode on the 8T is a bit tricky. Whereas the 3x optical zoom on the 7T Pro makes it a lot easier to get a tighter shot, trying to get a good close up photo with the 8T was an exercise in frustration for me. But zooming into the macro shots, such as the one of the pewter knight below, you can see that the 8T better captures the texture in the knight’s helmet. The lack of a telephoto camera rears its ugly head again with the 8T’s 10x zoom, which uses a hybrid mix of optical and electronic image stabilisation. Zooming into signs revealed an ugly distorted mess with the 8T. The OnePlus 7T Pro and the Pixel 5 — which also lacks a telephoto lens — produce much clearer images. Speaking of distorting, the 16MP ultra wide angle camera offers a 123-degree field of view, but despite capturing extensive landscapes, there’s some poor image processing going on. Take the photo of the geese below: the standard camera shot presents a perfectly fine shot. But switching to the wide angle mode ended up with very muddy images, as if someone had smudged the shot. The trunk of the tree looks strangely smooth and the leaves of trees in the background look worse than a hastily painted watercolor. By default, the 8T handles night time photography reasonably well, albeit slightly blowing out some light sources. Activate the Nightscape mode and it’ll pick out a lot more detail in the highlights and illuminate previously dark areas. Compared to the Pixel 5, the 8T produces brighter night time shots, though it adds a bit of yellow hue to photos and over-saturates colors. Take a look at the scene below: The 8T’s shot is brighter but the red gate has been given a candy red color, when it’s actually more muted and closer to the Pixel 5’s rendition. And zoom into the red car on the right and you’ll see the Pixel 5 displays the number plate a lot clearer, whereas the 8T has a lot more noise; the smoothing in dimly lit photos seems to have been abandoned in the Nightscape mode. One area that the Pixel 5 crushed the OnePlus 8T is in portrait photos. As you can see in the photos of my friend Claire, the Pixel 5 produces a detailed and well-composed portrait shot. Whereas the 8T gets the colors and white balance all wrong, making Claire look rather washed out. And aggressive smoothing has taken out all the texture of her hair. This is one of the most disappointing shots the 8T has produced, especially when the OnePlus 8 Pro delivered strong profile photos. What’s both interesting and irritating here, is the OnePlus 8T produces decent profile photos of people without the portrait mode enabled. There’s a little more smoothing going on compared to the Pixel 5, and skin tones look less natural. But otherwise photos of people captured using the 8T’s main camera are thoroughly decent, though far from excellent. Completing the rear cameras is the 2MP monochrome camera. It shoots decent monochrome photos, which is nice to have but I feel like it’s a bit of a gimmick; I’d much rather a telephoto lens instead. Flip the OnePlus 8T around and you’ve got the same standard 16MP selfie camera of the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro. And much like those phones, the 8T does a good job of selfies. From the selfie my colleague Adam Ismail snapped, the 8T produces a sharper image than the Pixel 5. But Google’s phone delivers more natural colors, with the 8T adding a red tinge to Adam's face. And it’s pretty much the same story for the front-facing camera’s portrait mode. Video on the OnePlus 8T starts at 1080p and 30 frames per second and tops out at 4K 60fps, much like the previous OnePlus 8 phones. And there’s a Super Slow Motion mode that can capture 720p videos at 480fps or 1080p videos at 240fps. There's also Nightscape and portrait bokeh modes for video capture; I’m not convinced by the latter which feels a bit gimmicky.  However, I do like the Super Stable mode that fuses optical and electronic stabilization to take the wobble out of shaky camera work. Overall, the video performance of the OnePlus 8T is decent but nothing about it particularly wowed me.I suspect the issues I experienced with the OnePlus 8T’s cameras are down to poor image processing rather than hardware. This is something that's blighted OnePlus phones at launch before, and subsequent software updates have drastically improved rear camera performance. But I feel OnePlus should have figured this out by now and it's annoying to encounter such problems in a phone that’s facing ever stiffer competition. I had been expecting the OnePlus 8T to come with the Snapdragon 865 Plus, as ‘T’ OnePlus phones tend to use Qualcomm’s very latest system-on-a-chip. But the OnePlus 8T has the Snapdragon 865, the same as the OnePlus 8 models released six months ago. A OnePlus spokesperson told me that the company feels the Snapdragon 865 is more than capable of handling anything that can be thrown at it, so an upgrade wasn't worthwhile. My suspicion here is OnePlus has decided not to fork out for the latest Qualcomm SoC in order to save money and thus keep the price of the 8T competitive.As such, the OnePlus 8T performs pretty much the same as other phones from this year with the Snapdragon 865. In Geekbench 5, the 8T managed a single-core score of 887 and got 3,203 in the multi-core test. Both the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro scored a little higher, but that could be down to the potential extra demand of the new software features of Android 11 and OxygenOS 11. The OnePlus 8T beats the S20 FE’s multicore score of 2,928, but the Samsung handset comes with 6GB of RAM compared to the 8T’s 12GB. So that could explain the performance difference. On the graphics side, the OnePlus 8T took on the GFXBench Aztec Ruins Vulcan test and kicked out a score of 1,375 frames (21 frames per second). Again, this performance is on par with the OnePlus 8 phones and the S20 FE, which managed 1,325 frames. Phones with the Snapdragon 865 Plus, as well as the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, will beat the OnePlus 8T in benchmarks. But otherwise, the 8T has flagship performance that shows in real-world use. The OnePlus 8T chews through games like Call of Duty Mobile, which runs particularly smoothly as it’s optimized to make use of the 120Hz refresh rate. There’s a new vapor chamber cooling system in the phone, which is a feature you’re most likely to find in gaming handsets. Supposedly this should help keep the 8T cooler when carrying out demanding tasks like gaming, but I found it still got pretty warm even after a short bout of Call of Duty. In general use, OnePlus phones have always felt fast thanks to the lightweight nature of OxygenOS not bogging Android down. The same is true of the OnePlus 8T, as it’s very responsive, firing up apps and bouncing from Gmail into Whatsapp and then to YouTube is very slick. The lack of a Snapdragon 865 Plus might be a disappointment for some diehard OnePlus fans, but that doesn't mean the 8T isn’t one of the fastest feeling phones around. You can expect the OnePlus 8T to get you through a day’s worth of use before gasping for electrical juice, thanks to its 4,500 mAh battery. In our test, which involves continuous web surfing with the display set at 150 nits of screen brightness, the 8T managed 9 hours and 58 minutes with its screen running at 120Hz. That’s not the 11 hours plus needed to make it onto our best phone battery life list. But it’s on par with other phones with high-refresh rate displays, outlasting the OnePlus 8 Pro, despite its 120 mAh larger battery, by 56 minutes. And it trounced the endurance of the S20 FE’s 4,500 mAh battery, which only managed 8 hours and 58 minutes.Drop the display down to 60Hz and you’ll get 10 hours and 49 minutes of battery life, which is better than the average time for smartphones. But since going back to 60Hz isn’t an easy thing, I’d rather take the hit in battery life. And that's thanks to OnePlus’ new Warp Charge 65. Very fast charging has always been one of the best features of OnePlus phones. And ramping up the speed of Warp Charge from 30W to 65W has further boosted OnePlus’ charging tech. The OnePlus 8T will now charge from zero to 55 percent battery capacity in a mere 15 minutes. Wait for 30 minutes and you'll have a battery that’s 93 percent full. That should actually be ‘batteries’ as OnePlus has used two smaller batteries rather than one large battery pack in the 8T. Doing this somewhat circumnavigates the limitations of electrical resistance and heat when upping charger wattage and allows the 8T to charge very fast. Expect this tech to be adopted by other phone makers next year. In practical terms, Warp Charge 65 means battery anxiety is pretty much eliminated if you’re near a wall socket. This charging comes at a price though, as there's no wireless charging support with the OnePlus 8T. This is a little disappointing, as we’ve waited for ages for OnePlus to finally adopt wireless charging with the 8 Pro, only to see the OnePlus 8T drop it. I was told that OnePlus boss Pete Lau tried out a prototype with a wireless charging coil and decided it gave the phone too much bulk, so asked for it to be removed. I’m an advocate for wireless charging and feel it should now be a feature for mid-range phones, as well as flagship handsets, given the Pixel 5 has a wireless charging coil. Out of the box the OnePlus 8T comes with Android 11, which brings features such as media controls embedded into the drop-down menu and new screenshot controls. It also means the 8T has the latest security and privacy controls for Android. But the most interesting thing here is the debut of OxygenOS 11. The lightweight skin OnePlus adds on top of Android remains relatively fuss-free, but brings in a few improvements. These include gestures optimized for one-handed use. For example, there's a gap between the main settings heading and the menu options, meaning things like Wi-Fi and display controls are positioned toward the lower two-thirds of the screen making them easier to reach. There is also a fresh dark mode that adjusts color tones and menu layers to make content easier to read. And generally the overall experience of using OxygenOS feels a little neater and cleaner, not that it was too messy to begin with compared to some other Android skins. OxygenOS 11 also brings in an always-on display that can be configured to display a mix of notifications and clock styles; just keep in mind that this feature likes to chew on battery life. The most notable clock style is the new Insight AOD, which shows a type of temperature bar that goes from dark to light to dark to signify the passing off the day and is segmented with dark gaps to show when and how many times you have unlocked the 8T. That should appeal to people into digital wellbeing, as should the Zen mode that can lockdown the phone for 20 minutes to encourage you to stop checking it. The under-display fingerprint scanner on the OnePlus 8T remains as responsive as ever. And Face Unlock is a solid alternative to finger-based biometrics, though you should bear in mind that it’s still not as secure as Apple’s Face ID. When I first got my hands on the OnePlus 8T, I really wanted to love it. I thought OnePlus was going to take the best parts of the high-end OnePlus 8 Pro and return to its roots by making a serious flagship-killer, especially after the underwhelming OnePlus 8. But the $749 price tag is too much, given the competition, and disappointing camera performance has made the OnePlus 8T a letdown. Build quality, performance, and 120Hz display are serious high points for the OnePlus 8T. But I don’t think it really marks a major upgrade over the OnePlus 7T from last year. It’s a bit faster in benchmarks, but in real-world use that doesn't make a huge difference. And I don't think a jump from a 90Hz display to 120Hz is worth the price of an upgrade. If you’re looking to upgrade from a non-OnePlus phone, then the 8T is still difficult to recommend at the moment. It might beat the Galaxy S20 FE on paper, but Samsung’s phone is cheaper n the U.S. and delivers impressive performance; it can also match the OnePlus 8T’s 120Hz display while taking better pictures. And if you can make do with a less powerful chip and a 90Hz display, which I think is fine, then the Pixel 5 crushes the 8T on phone photography. You’ll note I said “at the moment.” That’s because if OnePlus improves the 8T’s cameras with a software update, then the phone could be a contender again, especially if its price then drops below $700. After all, the OnePlus 8T is a joy to use if you’re not snapping photos, thanks to OxygenOS 11 and super-fast charging, it’s just a shame OnePlus has dropped the ball with the cameras once again."
50,Asus ROG Phone 5,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/rog-phone-5,"OS: Android 11 / ZenUI Screen size: 6.78-inch AMOLED (2448 x 1080); 60 - 144Hz Processor: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB, 12GB, 16GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 64MP ultrawide (f/1.8), 13MP ultrawide (f/2.4), 5MP macro (f/2.0) Front camera: 24MP (f/2.45) Video: Up to 8K at 30 fps Battery: 6,000 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 12:23 (60Hz) / 10:53 (120Hz) / 10:27 (144Hz) Charging: 65W Colors: Phantom Black, Storm White Size: 6.1 x 2.7 x 0.36 inches Weight: 8.39 ouncesThe ROG Phone 5 hasn't helped my skepticism regarding dedicated ""gaming phones."" After all, since these devices use the same system on chip as the other best Android phones, what advantages could they possibly offer over a regular handset? The improvements seemed marginal, at least to me.But gaming phones have thrived, in part by pushing features like fast-refreshing displays to the mainstream. And so Asus is back with a new generation of its ROG phone, which will be available in three different variations.That brings us to the crown king of gaming phones, the Asus ROG Phone 5, the fourth generation gaming phone under the Taiwanese company’s Republic of Gamers brand. Asus has made three versions of this device — the base model, the ROG Phone 5 Pro, and a limited Ultimate edition.Regardless of which version you opt for, our Asus ROG Phone 5 review finds a device jammed pack with hardware and software designed to give you the best gaming experience. It's in the other smartphone features where the ROG Phone 5 comes up short, however.Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones. The ROG Phone 5 won two highly recommended awards.The Asus ROG 5 is now available in the U.S. having initially launched into the U.K. and Europe. However, only the standard $999 model is available, with the top-end Ultimate handset still missing from American soil. For residents of the U.K. and Europe, the base ROG Phone 5 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is available for €799/£799. You can upgrade the RAM to 12GB and storage for 256GB for another €100/£100. For yet another €100/£100, you can get 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.The base model ROG Phone 5, which we’re reviewing here, comes in two colors: Phantom Black and Storm White. Both units feature the RGB dot matrix ROG logo on the back for that added flair.Though not included in this review, there is also a ROG Phone 5 Pro with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for €1199. It comes out in April. Instead of the dot matrix logo on the phone’s back, you get a PMOLED color display that Asus calls ROG Vision. It’s customizable in the Armoury Crate app, where you can decide what moving image you want to display.Finally, there’s also the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate, a celebration of the ROG brand and gamers everywhere. It not only features a unique monochrome body and with a monochrome PMOLED ROG Vision, but it comes with 512GB of storage and a whopping 18GB of RAM. This is a limited edition phone that you can get for €1299, available in May. We have a separate ROG Phone 5 Ultimate review if you’d like to check that out.The whole look of the black base model ROG Phone 5 screams edgy for edginess’ sake. It falls into the ""gamer"" aesthetic and it won't be for everyone. And this is coming from someone who uses a ROG Crosshair motherboard and Strix 2080 Ti in his gaming PC. One could hope that people have outgrown the need for sharp accents, huge logos, and RGB to prove they’re worthy of the title of “gamer,” especially on a phone. Alas, Asus has gone all out with the ROG Phone 5’s design. It won’t be for everyone, even those who spend a lot of time playing video games.I have large hands and the 6.1 x 2.7 x 0.36-inch ROG Phone 5 still feels bulky and unwieldy, but that’s the cost of the huge 6,000 mAh battery inside it. The 6.78-inch display takes up the front of the phone with minimal bezels all around. There’s no hole punch or notch for the front camera, which is nestled in the top bezel.The ROG Phone 5 features an optical fingerprint sensor built into the display. The feature works OK, though I had trouble with accuracy and false negatives multiple times a day. The in-display sensor on the Galaxy S21 Plus behaves far more consistently.Tucked away at the very edges of the top and bottom bezels are the front-facing stereo speakers, which are some of the best speakers I’ve heard on a phone. They’re punchy, they’re powerful, and they’ll wow you with their depth. But there’s also a headphone jack with a quad ESS DAC, so you can have an even better audio experience with the ROG Phone 5. I really appreciated this inclusion.One of the weirdest things about the ROG Phone 5 is where Asus placed the phone’s ports. The power USB-C port is on the left side underneath a removable (and easily-losable) cover. Alongside it is the POGO connector for the optional AeroActive cooler accessory, which clips onto the phone. The cooler accessory is a basically a small fan that attaches to the back of the phone and assists with cooling. The ROG logo on the back of it glows and there’s a substantial kickstand if you want to prop the phone up. A second USB-C port lives on the bottom of the frame, but that is used for the Kunai 3 Gamepad. Besides the cooler accessory, the ROG Phone 5 employs AirTriggers to boost the gaming experience. These ultrasonic shoulder buttons can be mapped to a specific action per game. They don’t work perfectly in every title, and in some cases they can be a hindrance, but it’s just one more thing to make the ROG Phone feel like a step above non-gaming phones. The ROG Phone 5 is a big boy, make no mistake. It’s heavy, which leads to quicker wrist and finger fatigue (especially while gaming for long periods of time), but it’s also a solid device. Asus did an excellent job with this phone’s build quality, making it feel very premium.The star of the show is the 6.78-inch custom AMOLED display manufactured by Samsung. The ROG Phone 5 sports a beautiful screen, perfect for gaming. It’s huge, it has excellent color reproduction, and it gets plenty bright. I really enjoyed this display while I was using the ROG Phone 5.You also get four refresh rate modes to choose from: 60Hz, 120Hz, 144Hz, and Auto. The latter adaptively changes the refresh rate depending on what you’re doing. If you’re scrolling a lot or playing a game, the refresh rate will ramp up, scaling back down for more static activities. Obviously, 60Hz is the most battery-efficient refresh rate, but the 144Hz mode is available for games that support higher frame rates (like Dead Cells).In its Natural color calibration, the ROG Phone 5 reproduced 180.2% of the sRGB and 127.6% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts. Its Delta-E score, where 0 is perfect, was 0.31. For comparison, in its Natural mode, the Galaxy S21 Plus managed 103.8% of sRGB and 73.5% of DCI-P3 with a Delta-E of 0.18. (Delta-E numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)A top-tier gaming phone ought to have a display to match its high-end specs and the ROG Phone 5 delivers. It’s also plenty bright enough to see outdoors, even in direct sunlight, hitting 748 nits in our testing, which is inline with the Galaxy S21 Plus’ 747 nits. The ROG Phone 5 may be a gaming phone, but it still features cameras just like any other handset. You get a triple camera array on the back: a 64MP ultrawide main sensor joined by a 13MP ultrawide shooter, and a 5MP macro lens. Those cameras turned in a disappointing performance. Compared to a comparably priced Galaxy S21 Plus, the photos I took with the Asus ROG Phone 5 didn't impress me. Asus usually does a good job with cameras and software, so this is a bit surprising.In optimal lighting conditions outdoors, the ROG Phone 5 produces adequate shots with decent colors and depth. Compared to the Galaxy S21 Plus, which likes to overexpose and oversaturate, the ROG Phone 5’s picture feels a bit restrained. It’s not bad, though there’s something off about it.In direct sunlight, the ROG Phone 5 started to stumble. The red of the fire hydrant looks a bit dim, almost toned down, in the ROG Phone’s shot. It’s a bit more vibrant in the S21 Plus’ photo, but both phones had a bit of trouble regulating themselves in the harsh sunlight. Overall, though, the Galaxy S21 Plus did a better job.Moving indoors, both phones did well with the statuette of Merida. The colors of her hair and dress look nice in both images, even if the Galaxy S21 Plus’ looks a bit stronger in comparison. These pictures were taken in the late afternoon with soft ambient lighting, but I like how they both turned out.Stepping outside for portraits, the ROG Phone 5 used a relatively mild blur radius in comparison to the Galaxy S21 Plus, but I look very overexposed in the shot. The S21 Plus manages to capture some of the redness in my skin, but its portrait isn’t a whole lot better than the ROG Phone 5’s.Putting the ROG Phone 5 up against the Galaxy S21 Plus for night mode, you can immediately see the difference. It’s almost like the ROG Phone 5’s night mode didn’t even try, whereas the grill is actually visible in the S21 Plus’ photo.For selfies, the ROG Phone 5 uses a 24MP front camera. It captured the yellow in my camera strap, but the whole photo looks a bit cool. The berries and bricks in the background are blurry, too. Overall, this selfie is not one I’d want to post or share anywhere. The S21 Plus made everything a bit green, but everything in the shot stayed in focus. The ROG Phone 5 is sold on the fact that it’s the ultimate mobile gaming machine, replete with everything you need to see yourself succeed in your favorite games. While no amount of hardware will make up for a lack of skill or understanding, having the best internals you can possibly get doesn’t hurt.The ROG Phone 5 uses the latest system-on-chip from Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 888, paired with 8GB, 12GB or 16GB of RAM, depending on which configuration you order. You will want for nothing as far as raw performance is concerned. The Snapdragon 888 still pales in comparison to the A14 Bionic from Apple, but it’s the best SoC you can get in an Android device right now.This is the best Snapdragon 888 device we’ve tested thus far. In Geekbench 5, the ROG Phone 5 (with X-Mode disabled) scored 3,672 on multicore. That trounces the Galaxy S21 Plus’ 3,300 result, even if it comes up shy against the iPhone 12 Pro’s 3,880.In 3DMark’s Wild Life Unlimited, the ROG Phone 5 scored 5,806 with an average fps of 34.8. That barely beats the S21 Plus’ 33.4 average fps, but falls behind the iPhone 12 Pro’s 39 fps average. Anecdotally, this phone is a monster in games, but even it struggles with a title like Genshin Impact on max settings. I saw frame rates bouncing between 17 and 45 just in the main hub area without fighting or anything. In Call of Duty: Mobile, my other favorite mobile game, the ROG Phone 5 was a champ. I saw consistent frame rates, accurate touch response, and plenty of battery life to keep me playing for countless matches (most of which I dominated, I might add).With the right profile selected (more on that later), Asus’ phone gives you its all and then some in games. It’s too bad that all this power feels relatively wasted on what’s available in Google Play right now, but that’s more a commentary on mobile gaming rather than anything against the ROG Phone 5.The ROG Phone 5 comes with a total battery capacity of 6,000 mAh, split into two 3,000 mAh power packs. This allows for the simultaneous 65W charging speed and for Asus to use a PCB with the Snapdragon 888 in the middle (for heat purposes). These big batteries contribute to the phone’s overall size, but it’s all worth it given how long the ROG Phone 5 can last on a charge.In our battery life test, where the phone is left to endlessly reload webpages over a cellular connection at 150 nits of screen brightness, the ROG Phone 5 performed extremely well. In 60Hz mode, the ROG Phone 5 managed a whopping 12 hours and 23 minutes. In 120Hz mode, that drops to a still impressive 10 hours and 53 minutes. Finally, ramping the display up to 144Hz nets 10 hours and 27 minutes.In real-world use, the ROG Phone 5 is a battery-life champ. Outside of gaming, I was able to get more than two days of use before having to charge again. When gaming, the battery can last for a long time, too, even when playing Genshin Impact in 144Hz mode with the AeroActive cooler and Kunai 3 Gamepad attached. Asus claims that the ROG Phone 5 can charge from 0% to 70% in just 30 minutes on the 65W charger and to full in about an hour. Charging a 6,000 mAh battery from empty to full is a large task, so that’s an impressive number. In 30 minutes, the ROG Phone went from 0% to 70% on its 65W charger. It reached 44% in 15 minutes.To make sure that the batteries last long in terms of lifespan, Asus has introduced a few charging modes. The Steady charging mode slows down the charging speed, so the battery will take longer to fill up, but it’ll also generate less heat. Scheduled charging is what it sounds like and can work with active alarms (i.e. the phone stops charging when your morning alarm goes off). You can also set an upper charging limit of 80%, 90%, and 100% to extend the battery’s lifespan. Finally, you can go with Bypass charging, which uses the power cable to provide power to the phone without charging the battery itself.With the ZenFone 6, Asus changed its mobile software direction and introduced a minimal, stock-like Android experience like you might find on Pixels or OnePlus devices. There were several additional features tucked away in the Settings, but the new ZenUI offered users an unhindered software experience. That has continued somewhat with the ROG Phone 5.ZenUI looks much the same as before, but there are multiple ROG “enhancements” on offer, which look a lot like Asus’ ROG Windows software, for better or for worse. I’ll give the company credit for consistency.  I’d say 90% of the ZenUI experience, based on Android 11, is nice, minimal, and mostly good.Asus wants the gaming tweaks and additions to add meaningful value. By dragging in from the edge of the screen while in-game, you get a feature-packed control panel called Game Genie. This offers shortcuts for optimizing the system for peak gameplay, turning off notifications, blocking navigation, setting refresh rates, and accessing the AirTrigger and macro settings. It also offers some quick stats like your average FPS, CPU temp, and clock speed.I frankly forgot to use the Game Genie more often than not. Its aesthetic heavily contrasts with the relatively demure default ZenUI look. I think the shortcuts are nice, especially for setting up AirTriggers and macros, but I’d rather the design match the rest of the phone rather than some nebulous connection to the ROG PC stuff. The ROG software, called the Armoury Crate, in general is full of flashy colors and boisterous, “futuristic” sounds.Like its PC brethren, the ROG Phone 5 has different profiles for different purposes. Spearheading these is called X-Mode, which is what Asus considers to be the best for gaming. Simply put, X-Mode maximizes performance. There’s also Dynamic, which is my preferred profile — it adjusts to your use and needs accordingly. The Ultra durable profile aims to maximize battery life, while a custom mode lets you tweak settings like you might for your motherboard. You can get into some really nitty gritty details here.The ROG Phone 5 comes with an RGB dot matrix display on the back of the phone, the colors of which can be customized in the Armoury Crate. You can set the secondary display to react to notifications, games, and some other options. I don’t think it’s really necessary, but it definitely makes the phone stand out.If you’re looking for ultimate mobile gaming performance, the ROG Phone 5 is definitely at the top of the list. Its gargantuan battery lasts an incredibly long time, the custom AMOLED display is gorgeous, and the raw power makes almost everything playable at 60 fps or above.However, if taking good pictures matters to you, the ROG Phone 5 is just okay. Its night mode falls flat, however. The photos are by no means bad, but I prefer the ones produced by other similarly-priced phones like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12, and Galaxy S21 Plus.Buy the ROG Phone 5 if you want a mammoth battery that’s incredibly difficult to kill or if you want the peak gaming performance available on Android. It's a true marvel of engineering to be sure. And you get some extra RGB and gamer flair for your money (if that's your thing), which helps the phone stand out from the crowd."
51,Vivo x60 Pro Plus,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/vivo-x60-pro-plus,"Starting price: TBA Display: 6.56 inches, FHD AMOLED (2376 x 1080) Refresh rate: 60Hz/120Hz Rear cameras: 50MP main (f/1.57), 48MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 32MP (f/2.08), 8MP (f/3.4) Front camera: 32MP Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB Battery: 4,200 mAh Charging: 55W wired Operating system: Android 11 with Funtouch OS 11.1 Size: 158.59 × 73.35 × 9.10mm Weight: 6.7 ounces (191g)You can’t accuse the Vivo x60 Pro Plus of being a by-the-numbers phone. This top-of-the-range Android handset may seem like other Ultra or Pro phones on the surface, but it boasts some unique tricks that could boost the phone’s appeal, at least for a select audience.The Vivo x60 Pro Plus comes with a built-in gimbal that delivers smoother video than what you’d see from rival smartphones. Plus, Vivo’s teammates at Zeiss have made sure the phone takes still images just as skillfully. Sadly, other parts of the Vivo X60 Pro Plus experience don’t stand up so well. Besides that, the fact you plain can’t buy this phone in the U.K. yet, or in the U.S. at all, hurts its broad appeal. Our Vivo x60 Pro Plus review finds a phone you have to appreciate for its technical achievements, even if that doesn’t translate into a purchase.Vivo phones are sold in the U.K., but the Chinese phone maker has yet to announce availability for the x60 range, including the Pro Plus. Vivo doesn’t operate in the U.S., which means no matter how good this phone is, you’re better off buying a different phone rather than trying to import one.The last generation, the Vivo x51 5G, started at £749, putting it on par with current phones like the Xiaomi Mi 11. However the x51 used a Snapdragon 765G chipset, which is a step below the Snapdragon 888 found in the x60. Therefore you should expect the X60 Pro Plus’ price to be higher. There's only a single model of the x60 Pro Plus available, which offers 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.With a central punch-hole and curved edges on the display, design and feature set of the Vivo X60 Pro Plus looks similar to the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, although Vivo’s phone is much smaller.It's more than an ounce lighter than the Ultra, (6.7 ounces compared to 8.1), and about a third of an inch smaller (6.56 inches compared to 6.8 inches). While large phones have their place, it’s good to see Vivo make a range-topping phone that’s a more manageable size.You normally have a choice of either Orange or Emperor Blue vegan leather backs for the x60 Pro Plus, but blue is the only available finish in the U.K. A leather finish is a classy way of differentiating the phone from the average glass-backed flagship, as is the sharp-looking rectangular camera block with its tiny Zeiss badge. It's one of the most mature-looking phones I've tried out this year.The x60 Pro Plus’ display isn’t quite as big as the 6.8-inch Galaxy S21 Ultra or 6.7-inch OnePlus 9 Pro, but at 6.56 inches, you’ve still got plenty of display to work with.. Vivo’s screen also has a lower resolution than most equivalent phones —FHD instead of QHD. You can choose between 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rate modes, plus a “Smart Switch” option to jump between them to conserve battery. That’s a welcome feature, but it doesn’t compare to the fully variable LTPO displays as you have on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or the OnePlus 9 Pro.Watching the trailer for Netflix's The Irregulars showed that the x60 can adeptly show off the show's strange twist on Victorian London, with crisp shadows and brightly colored clothing. The phone’s audio doesn't match up to the visuals, however, as Vivo only fitted the x60 with a single speaker rather than the more common dual-firing set-up you get on most flagship Androids.Cameras are where Vivo wants the x60 Pro Plus to stand out. You get four rear cameras with the x60 — a 50MP main shooter, a 48MP ultrawide lens, a 32MP portrait sensor with 2x zoom and an 8MP telephoto lens. That latter telephoto lens features 5x optical and 60x maximum zoom. There’s a 32MP selfie cam on the phone’s front.I tested the x60 Pro Plus against the iPhone 12 Pro, starting with a main sensor shot of the Readymoney Drinking Fountain in Regent’s Park. The texture of the marble and granite comes across equally well in both shots, but I dislike how much darker the x60’s image is compared to the iPhone’s.One of Vivo’s big new features this year is its new partnership with German lensmaker Zeiss. This brings Zeiss’ imaging system to the x60’s cameras along with a T* anti-reflective lens coating, which should help avoid unwanted “ghosting” effects when you have the camera aimed at a bright object.You can see something is obviously different when comparing these two nighttime shots of Tufnell Park Underground station. The flare of light coming off of the street lamp is much less disruptive in the x60 Pro’s shot, and has a pleasant looking green tinge. However looking at the entire photo, I’d say the iPhone offers a better image thanks to its overall brightness. I used the ultrawide lenses to take a look inside this hollowed-out log, and found the Vivo offers much better colors, whether it’s the rain-slick exterior or the dry, darkened interior. That makes sense, since not only does the x60 offer more megapixels (48MP to 12MP), its sensor is approximately 40% larger than the iPhone’s, which makes a big difference when it comes to capturing light and color.The x60’s main telephoto lens offers 5x optical zoom, which I used to peek over the fence into ZSL London Zoo to check out the Bactrian camel enclosure. There is no contest between the two images since the iPhone’s optical zoom maxes out at 2x, and has to use digital zoom to make up the rest, resulting in a lower resolution image.There’s also the Vivo’s 2x zoom camera. While you can use this for telephoto shots, its stated purpose is for portrait-mode images. I set up a self-portrait with a tripod in my back garden, and the result is the best bokeh effect I’ve ever seen on a smartphone. The iPhone’s image is great when it comes to color, and provides a nice background blur of its own, but this is the x60 Pro Plus’ strongest shot.The only camera left to look at is the selfie camera. These portrait mode shots show the iPhone is better at picking out the boundary between my head and the sky and trees, making for an overall cleaner image. However I do quite like the natural highlights on the x60’s photo, more so than the flatter image Apple’s post-processing has provided.The x60 Pro Plus’ party trick comes from the ultrawide sensor’s Gimbal Stabilization 2.0, an evolution of the one found on the Vivo x50. It's meant to act just like the full-size stabilization systems you see used with professional video cameras, only this one’s small enough to fit inside the fairly slim camera block on the x60's back.Most flagship phones, including the iPhone 12 Pro, offer optical image stabilization (OIS) on select cameras alongside electronic image stabilization (EIS) on all sensors. A gimbal is essentially OIS on steroids, but the only unfortunate thing is that the gimbal is mounted on the x60 Pro Plus' ultrawide sensor rather than the main sensor. It means you don’t get access to the better stabilization when trying to take normal photos.To test the image stabilization, I recorded a brief walk through a tree-lined path near the top of Primrose Hill. I noticed the gimbal’s influence quite easily compared to other smartphone videos because the picture in the viewfinder was slow to change direction as the phone tried to keep the image from shaking. It felt like the frame was gently swaying, unlike the equivalent iPhone recording. While the iPhone-shot footage was still acceptably smooth, it more obviously impacted by each footstep.Trying a sweeping shot from a bridge over the Regent’s Canal, the impact of the x60’s gimbal was less obvious. It’s also here that I noticed that the iPhone produced more vivid color in its video, which is perhaps more of a priority for the average video-taking smartphone user than extra-smooth footage.All the same, the gimbal is an impressive achievement by Vivo, and its unique place in the market makes the x60 Pro Plus more appealing to smartphone videographers who want their clips to stand out.The Vivo x60 Pro Plus should be a top performer. The phone offers the 2021 premium flagship staples of 12GB RAM and a Snapdragon 888 system-on-chip, plus Vivo's secret weapon, extended RAM mode. This allows for 3GB of virtual RAM to be created within the x60's spacious 256GB of storage, giving the phone a boost when required.All that horsepower looks to have had a modest effect on our benchmarking tests. The x60 Pro Plus managed Geekbench 5 scores of 1,133 single core and 3,756 multi-core, which beats both the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (1,123 and 3,440) and the OnePlus 9 Pro (1,126 and 3,685). Vivo’s phone even beats the iPhone 12 Pro on the multicore test, although Apple’s A14 chip still beats the competition on single core performance (1,585 and 3,669).Putting the x60 Pro Plus through the 3DMark Wild Life graphics benchmark resulted in a score of 5,712 and an average frame rate of 34.2 frames per second. That’s a little better than the Galaxy S21 Ultra (5,653 and 33.9fps), and a little worse than the OnePlus 9 Pro (5,756 and 34.5fps). It’s far behind the iPhone 12 Pro though (6,618 and 39.0fps).Thanks to the built-in modem in the Snapdragon 888 chipset, the x60 Pro Plus has 5G by default. However, the phone only offers compatibility with sub-6GHz frequency bands according to Vivo's official list of supported 5G bands. This won't be a problem for U.K. users, as all carriers currently use this range of bands, but looking at the available bands, only T-Mobile 5G is supported among U.S. options. (Perhaps another reason the phone isn’t likely to reach the U.S.) The x60 Pro Plus’ 4,200 mAh battery seems low capacity for an ultimate flagship, even one that’s smaller than many phablets. Running down the battery from 15% to zero by playing YouTube videos took about 3 hours and 51 minutes, which isn’t that long in my experience. It makes sense when you remember the screen’s 120Hz refresh rate taxes the x60 Pro Plus’ battery.Vivo throws a 55W fast charger in the box, which fills the phone up to 48% in 15 minutes, 80% in 30 minutes and to 100% in 46 minutes. 55W is not the most powerful charger around, but given the smaller capacity of the x60 Pro Plus, it makes sense that you don’t need so many watts to charge it at an acceptably fast speed.Vivo's Funtouch OS 11 is far from my favorite version of Android 11. There are many bloatware apps plus Vivo’s own V-Appstore, which not only regularly bugs you to use it, but then notifies you every time it completes an update. It’s very annoying.The other key part of the user experience, the haptic feedback, is weak. Tapping the keys feels nice and poppy but don't have the strength that you get on the best systems like those in the Google Pixel 5 or the OnePlus 9 series.Vivo includes two other models in the x60 range, the base X60 and the Pro version. The biggest differences between the three models involves the number of cameras, the charging speed and the chipsets. Curiously, the standard x60 gets the largest battery, although it is the only member of the range without a gimbal camera.What doesn’t change is the overall size of the phones, including screen size, resolution and refresh rates. While the design of each phone is almost identical, the standard and Pro models use glass backs rather than the Pro Plus' vegan leather, and both offer alternative colors to the Pro Plus pictured in this review.Although not the most well-rounded Android phone we've seen, there are still reasons why U.S. smartphone shoppers ought to be a little jealous of the U.K. and other countries where the Vivo x60 series is offered.Unfortunately, the x60 Pro Plus’ total photo package doesn’t quite match up to the best camera phones, and it’s far less pleasant to use than other Android devices because of its cluttered custom launcher and below-average battery life. However, the gimbal system on the Vivo x60 Pro Plus is really quite something, and would be a big asset for any smartphone videographer. Its dual telephoto lenses do a great job for long-distance and portrait shots, too. I like how unique those headline features are, in what can feel like a homogenous Android flagship market. However this time, the Vivo x60 Pro Plus can’t break out past its niche appeal."
52,Asus Zenfone 8,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/asus-zenfone-8,"OS: Android 11 / ZenUI 8 Display: 5.9-inch AMOLED (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 120 Hz CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 6GB, 8GB, 16GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 64MP (f/1.8) main, 12MP (f/2.2) ultrawide Front camera: 12MP Battery: 4,000 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 10:52 (60Hz) / 10:16 (90Hz) / 9:58 (120Hz) Charging speed: 30W Colors: Obsidian Black, Horizon Silver Size: 5.9 x 2.7 x 0.4 inches Weight: 5.96 ouncesThe Asus Zenfone 8 is here and it’s quite the head-turner. Asus may be a big name in the computing world, but it’s quite the underdog when it comes to phones. A few years back, the company rejected camera notches and cutouts, turning to a flipping camera module on the Zenfone 6. But the Zenfone 8 takes a more conventional approach to smartphone design and refines it. It does this in a small, compact frame with a ton of horsepower, a great display and good cameras.With a large battery, a fast-refreshing display, and a headphone jack, the Zenfone 8 ticks all of the boxes for what we’d look for in a great smartphone. The only question is one of availability: at this point, we don’t know if or when this is coming to North America.Despite that, the Zenfone 8 is an excellent device and perfect for people who want the most power out of their small phone. This is easily the best small Android phone with a screen that’s smaller than 6 inches. Read our full Zenfone 8 review to find out why.Asus has not yet revealed full pricing and availability, though we do know that the phone will start at €599. That's for the model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The Zenfone 8 also comes in 8GB and 16GB flavors. You can pair that 8GB of RAM with either 128GB or 256GB of storage. The 16GB version comes with 256GB.We still don't know full pricing and availability, but stay tuned for an update when we find out more.From all appearances, the Zenfone 8 is quite unassuming. In fact, it looks a bit like phones from a few years ago. The metal body curves to fit your hand and I love that. The phone is very small by modern standards, with a sub-6 inch display, just like the best small phones. The dual lens camera module protrudes ever so slightly from the back of the Zenfone 8, and the front camera sits in a hole punch cutout in the top left corner of the display.On the Obsidian Black model I tested for this Zenfone 8 review, the power button is a blue that contrasts well with the dark frame. The Zenfone 8 also packs in a wonderful surprise: a 3.5mm headphone jack.The compact body makes one-handing it a breeze. It’s also IP68 rated, so you need not worry about water being an issue. There’s an in-display optical fingerprint sensor, which worked quite well in my experience.Frankly, the only thing missing from the Zenfone 8 is a micro SD card slot. The lack of wireless charging due to the metallic body is a bummer, but no phone can be perfect. All told, I love the phone’s subdued design. At 5.9 x 2.7 x 0.4 inches, the Zenfone 8 is a diminutive little guy. I enjoy picking it up, especially given how accustomed to big phones I am. Asus did a great job on build quality and design.Coming in at 5.9 inches, the Zenfone 8’s AMOLED display is pretty small in this age of giant phablets. It packs a FHD+ resolution and up to 120 Hz on the refresh rate. You’ll get punchy colors and deep blacks with excellent viewing angles, too. You can lock the Zenfone 8’s display at 60Hz, 90Hz, or 120Hz. Or you can leave it in the auto mode, and the phone will adjust the refresh rate as needed, like we’ve seen on other phones recently.While not quite as striking as the OnePlus 9’s display, the Zenfone 8’s screen is still very good. In our testing, it reproduced 154.5% of the sRGB spectrum and 109.5% of the DCI-P3 gamut in its default color profile. It managed a Delta-E score of 0.27 — 0 is perfect, so the lower the number, the better.Compare that to the OnePlus 9’s Delta-E of 0.28 for its AMOLED panel. That phone managed 199.4% of the sRGB and 141.3 of the DCI-P3 color gamuts in its default mode. The Zenfone 8 gets brighter in our testing at 727 nits versus the OnePlus 9’s 696 nits.The Zenfone 8 uses two camera lenses, not unlike the Pixel 5. It has a 64MP wide-angle primary shooter and a 12MP ultrawide lens. For reference, the Pixel 5 has a 12.2MP primary and 16MP ultrawide. It might seem a bit unfair to pit the Zenfone 8 against the Pixel 5 in the camera department, as Google’s phone still ranks among the best camera phones. But both phones are similar in price, and this lets us see just how good of a bargain the Zenfone 8 really is.In this shot of flowers, the Zenfone 8 overexposed the scene and the focus is a bit soft. The color of the flowers is vibrant, yes, but it teeters on being too bright. The Pixel, meanwhile, kept its shot toned down since the image was captured in shadow on a bright, sunny day. I wouldn’t call the Zenfone’s image bad, but the Pixel’s is definitely better.I next took the phones to a part of the forest near my house. Again, you can see the slight differences between the two phones. The Zenfone is almost overexposed again, with greens that border on oversaturated. The Pixel kept the scene subdued and rich, with the green of the trees lush and verdant. Once more, the Zenfone’s shot is great, but the Pixel’s is better.Moving indoors, the Zenfone 8 captured Merida’s likeness extremely well. The well-lit room certainly helped, but this image really impressed me, especially when compared to the Pixel’s photo. It’s hard to tell a difference between the two because they’re both excellent. The blue of Merida’s dress, the yellow candle, and the green fern all come together in a great composition. The Zenfone 8 holds its own in the night mode department, too. In fact, I like its image better than the Pixel’s. It comes down to the noise. Yes, the Pixel 5 brought in more light, but at the cost of making the smoker noisy. The Zenfone 8 still brought in a ton of light, and the metal of the smoker is a bit smoother.The Zenfone 8 does not put out nearly the same quality of portrait shot as the Pixel does. The Zenfone’s attempt has a terrible blur radius, overexposing on my face and doing too much face smoothing. The Pixel’s photo captures the wrinkles near my eyes, the dry skin I need to moisturize, and the individual curly hairs of my beard. While the Zenfone 8 has done well thus far, it can’t hold a candle to the Pixel’s portrait shot.Finally, for selfies, you can’t go wrong with the Zenfone 8 and its 12MP front camera. It photographed me quite well, taking in the blue of my shirt, the black of my hat, and even the color of my eyes. The difference between the two selfies comes down to exposure and saturation. The Zenfone takes a similar approach to Samsung’s camera phones, boosting the colors in the scene, whereas the Pixel takes a more naturalistic approach, looking toned down overall. Regardless, I’d gladly post the Zenfone’s selfie.The Zenfone 8 sports a Snapdragon 888 processor with up to 16GB of RAM. It's a little powerhouse, crushing anything else Android-based in this size class — even the Pixel 5. This phone is no slouch, and it proves that both in real-world applications and in testing.In Geekbench 5, the Zenfone 8 scored 1,120 in single-core and 3,659 in multicore. That’s right in line with the numbers we tallied with the Snapdragon 888-powered OnePlus 9, which were 1,126 and 3,618 respectively. Those are good scores, but the iPhone 12 mini beats both phones at 1,602 and 4,123, thanks to Apple’s A14 Bionic processor.In the 3DMark Wild Life Unlimited graphics test, the Zenfone 8 achieved 34 frames per second, which lines up perfectly with the OnePlus 9. However, it still falls short of the iPhone 12 mini’s whopping 54 fps.We’ve seen several Snapdragon 888 phones by this point, so it shouldn’t surprise anyone that the Zenfone 8 does as well as it does, even though it lags behind the iPhone 12 mini. In real life, though, the phone performs amazingly well. It’s snappy, quick, and I don’t notice any lag when performing certain tasks like opening an app in Recents.The Zenfone 8 packs a 4,000 mAh battery, which is quite large considering the phone’s physical size. In my use, the phone got decent battery life, enough to get me through most days. Push it hard with Google Duo calls or gaming and you might be looking for a charger before winding down for the day.In the Tom’s Guide battery test, where a device is left to endlessly reload web pages on a cellular connection, the Zenfone 8 managed some decent times. In the 60 Hz mode, it lasted for 10 hours and 52 minutes, which is close to the 11-hour mark that devices on our best phone battery life list achieve.Up the display to 90 Hz and the phone managed a respectable 10:16 result on our battery test. Bump it up to 120 Hz and the phone just barely fell below the 10-hour mark we’d like to see at 9:58. So you can get a lot of life out of the Zenfone 8, especially if you take the middle road and set the dislay’s refresh rate at 90 Hz. I’ve stuck with the auto mode and I’ve had no complaints about battery life.We noticed some inconsistencies with charging speeds in our lab testing. Asus includes a 30W charger with the Zenfone 8, which should provide decent charging numbers. Instead, we saw that it only managed to recharge to 22% in 30 minutes. This heavily contrasts with Asus’ claims that it can recharge to 60% in 25 minutes.Asus took a page from OnePlus’ book all the way back with the Zenfone 6. The company radically changed its software design to more closely resemble OxygenOS. The result was a clean, minimalistic UX with plenty of tweaks and features tucked away in settings. I remember remarking at the time that Asus had finally gotten ZenUI to a good place.That decision continues all the way through the ROG Phone 5 and here with the Zenfone 8. ZenUI 8 looks a lot like what you’d find on a Pixel and it does a great job of doing what you want it to do and staying out of the way. Whereas OnePlus has since diverged a bit from Google’s vision, Asus sticks pretty close to it.Based on Android 11, ZenUI has a few tricks up its sleeve to set it apart from stock Android. First off, the power button can act as a Smart Key, meaning that you can change its behavior. You can customize both a double click and a press and hold action. There are quite a few options to choose from, though I’ve stuck with launching the camera and bringing up the power menu on my review unit.Elsewhere, you’ll find a gaming mode to reduce distractions while you’re gaming and push the Zenfone 8 to its max for intensive titles. Asus’ OptiPlex feature, wherein the software learns your habits and pre-loads commonly used apps, returns once again. You can disable or tweak it to your liking. There’s also a one-handed mode, making this small phone even easier to use single-handed.So far, Asus has not committed to any number of software updates for the Zenfone 8. We’re hoping for at least three as the company continues to put an emphasis on good software. Stay tuned for an update on this once we get confirmation.The Asus Zenfone 8 is a great phone, though its availability might leave some confused. But the hardware is excellent, the software is great, and the cameras perform way better than expected (especially after the extreme disappointment I had with the ROG Phone 5’s cameras). You’re getting a ton of phone with the Zenfone 8 and it’s definitely the best small Android phone, handily beating the Pixel 5 in every way except camera performance.I have few qualms with recommending this Zenfone 8, especially compared to some of its Android competitors, like the OnePlus 9. The value proposition is strong here, even though we don’t know full pricing just yet.But at a starting price of €599, this is one hell of a phone to beat. While it may not hold OnePlus’ feet to the fire in terms of scale, it certainly gives the OnePlus 9 a run for its money and should have the upcoming Pixel 6 quaking in its boots."

This budget Android phone offers a few impressive specs, with next-gen connectivity being one of the highlights.Another plus is the the 90Hz display, which is a pleasant surprise at this cheap price. And you get a big 5,000 mAh battery to boot. Then again, there are already a lot of great affordable phones out there — even if not all of them offer 5G.Based on our Realme 8 5G review, it's not quite best cheap phone material, but it's definitely worth a look. The Realme 8 5G goes on sale in the U.K. on May 20th. The U.S. market remains off-limits for Realme.The phone starts at £200, but if you pre-order it between now and launch day, you can get it with a £20 discount. There are two specs options, with either 4GB RAM and 64GB storage or the £249 8GB RAM/128GB storage model I tested. With this price/specs combination, it beats the equivalent Pixel 4a's basic price by £100, and the OnePlus Nord N10 5G by £80. However, both of these phones can often be found discounted, so it's worth looking for deals.I didn’t expect a stunning design from a phone as cheap as the Realme 8 5G, but when I first sized up the phone in the box, I had some appreciation for how Realme tried to make this phone look interesting.The sides and back of the phone are made of plastic, but the two-tone color scheme helps give the phone a little personality. The Supersonic Black colorway of my test unit gives the phone a mature air, and you can also get the more playful Supersonic Blue. Both are reflective and catch the light nicely, though you’ll have a hard time seeing it under all the fingerprints.The front of the Realme 8 5G looks a bit dated, due to an unfortunately chunky bottom bezel beneath its 6.5-inch display. The back camera block looked good to me at first, with the bump featuring a raised lip to stop the lenses from touching the surface you’ve laid the phone on. However, a closer look reveals that the 8 5G pretends to have more cameras than it has. There are four circles within the bump, but one of them doesn’t contain a lens, just an “AI” badge. That layout keeps things symmetrical, but also feels like Realme’s trying to make the phone look fancier than it is.Measuring 6.5 inches, the Realme 8 5G sits around the middle when it comes to Android handset sizes these days. In a surprise for a cheap phone, the RealMe 8 5G offers a fairly fast 90Hz refresh rate. It's not as smooth as the premium 120Hz rate found on the Redmi Note 10 Pro, but we'll take it. The Realme 8 5G can dynamically switch between 90Hz and 60Hz refresh rates depending on the task, which should save battery life.I watched the MCU Phase 4 trailer, and the highlights of the Marvel movies’ past and future were rendered in FHD resolution with bright colors that would make Stan Lee proud, and at a decent brightness for an LCD panel. The sound doesn’t match up quite so well, feeling a little tinny from the phone’s top and bottom speakers.The Realme 8 5G is equipped with a modest triple rear camera array. The highlight is the phone’s 48MP main sensor, which is backed up by a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro sensor.That’s meager pickings compared to the Redmi Note 10 Pro, the phone I compared the Realme against. While it costs the same as the Realme 8 5G, the Note 10 Pro offers much more impressive specs overall, including an additional ultrawide camera and a higher-res 108MP main sensor.This first comparison shows the main cameras’ performance when shooting this statue of the founder of London’s Waterlow Park. The Realme 8 5G’s photo is brighter than the Redmi’s, but it also has a much greener hue to it. The Redmi’s image is closer to real life, and therefore my favorite here.The only other primary camera on the Realme 8 5G is its macro sensor. It produces an acceptable image of this flower, but it has nothing on the Redmi’s photo. Redmi has a significant advantage in having a larger 5MP sensor with a “telemacro” lens that allows it to take close-ups from further away, allowing more light to illuminate the subject. It’s why the Realme 8 5G’s photo can’t match the Note 10 Pro’s shot for clarity, color or depth of field.Our last rear camera test looks at the depth sensors of both phones. Depth sensors aid the other cameras on a phone with special effects like bokeh, so this comparison shows two portrait mode shots taken with the rear main camera. Even with its bokeh slider cranked up to maximum, the Realme’s bokeh doesn’t match up to the Redmi’s in how blurred the background becomes. Both shots look good though, with the 8 5G offering a darker tint and the Note 10 Pro offering a lighter one.The final camera on the Realme is its 16MP selfie camera, which I tested with a portrait mode shot. It’s a similar story to the depth sensor in that the Redmi produces a much better bokeh effect, but both phones produce nice shots with different brightness levels.Rather than the typical Qualcomm Snapdragon chip found in Android phones, Realme packs Mediatek’s Dimensity 700 5G chip, combined with either 4GB, 6GB or 8GB of RAM.I put the 8GB version I received for testing through a couple of different benchmarks to judge its relative performance. On Geekbench 5, the Realme 8 5G returned a single core result of 568 and a multi-core result of 1,772. That’s quite a bit better than the Redmi Note 10, which managed scores of 247 and 1,330. It’s actually higher than the Google Pixel 4a, our favorite cheap phone, which managed 551 and 1,647.Moving to the Wild Life graphics test from 3DMark, the Realme managed a score of 1,102 and an average frame rate of 6.6 frames per second. Here it falls behind the Note 10 Pro (1,112 and 6.7 fps), showing an odd inconsistency in the abilities of the Dimensity chip.I played some Crash: On The Run to get some practical gaming experience on the Realme. Although the display does a good job of making the game’s bright colors look extra fun and inviting, it’s easy to spot the jagged edges around the characters.Realme packs its phones with as much battery capacity as possible, which is why you get a 5,000 mAh power pack in the 8 5G. Disappointingly, while other phones in the Realme 8 family get 65W charging, this phone settles for 18W charging. That gets the battery to 29% full in 15 minutes and 48% in 30 minutes.Running down the phone from 15% to zero by continuously playing YouTube videos, I managed 3 hours 49 minutes before the screen shut off and the phone went quiet. It's a little shorter than I'd like to see from a phone with such a large battery, but I suppose it's the sacrifice you make by including such a nice display.Realme UI 2.0, based on Android 11, tries to make meaningful alterations to the basic operating system. However, scrolling the homepage right and finding all the pre-installed apps Realme’s given you isn’t a particularly good start.Fortunately, Realme wins points back with some unique software options for increasing the phone’s usability. Several features increase the phone’s ease of use with just one hand, such as Icon Pull Down which moves the apps within reach of your thumb with a gesture, and the option to double-tap an empty portion of the home screen to lock the phone without hitting the power button.Confusingly, Realme’s three-model range is already partly released, with the 8 Pro already on offer. And the weirdness doesn’t stop there.As you can see in the table below, Realme’s phones don’t become cumulatively better as you move up the range. For example, the basic Realme 8 has faster charging than the Realme 8 5G, and a larger 64MP main camera, but costs the same. The Realme 8 5G is the only phone that offers a 90Hz refresh rate and a slightly larger 6.5-inch display as well as the 5G connectivity that it’s named after. The 8 Pro offers a 108MP main camera and a 50W charger, but also uses a smaller battery than the other two models.I don’t think I’ve come across a more messy range of phones. Realme doesn’t sell all three phones in all the territories it’s active in, which may explain there’s this unusual arrangement of specs. However, you should compare all available models where you live if you’re interested, to make sure you get the best specs on whichever feature you prioritize.It’s hard to find 5G compatibility on budget phones, so the Realme 8 5G just existing is already a benefit. It’s also got a surprisingly nice display for such a cheap phone with its AMOLED panel and 90Hz refresh rate, so you can put that 5G to good use enjoying a video or online gaming while away from Wi-Fi.Unfortunately, if 5G isn’t a key selling point for you right now, the Redmi Note 10 Pro is better than the RealMe Pro 8 in almost every regard. It’s larger, has better cameras, a more inviting user interface and faster charging, plus its display can manage 120Hz like many leading flagship phones.U.S. users can’t buy either, and are better off looking for the Pixel 4a or a Moto G Power if their priority is a low price. Overall, U.K. customers who can buy the Realme 8 5G have limited reasons to pick it up over the Redmi, or other great cheap phones like the Pixel 4a."
54,iOS 14.5,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ios-145-review-big-changes-to-an-already-big-update,"Normally, you'd be inclined to overlook a software update like iOS 14.5. Software updates released between major releases — in this case, last fall's iOS 14 and iOS 15 which we're expecting to see this September — offer tweaks, bug fixes, some fine-tuning of earlier features... and not much else.This is definitely not the case with iOS 14.5, released in late April with enough new additions to make us revisit the iOS 14 update overall. In addition to rolling out the privacy enhancement, Apple promised us last year, iOS 14.5 brings new capabilities to your iPhone, such as as the ability to unlock your device when you're wearing a mask (provided you've got an Apple Watch nearby). Maps, Podcasts and even Siri see some significant changes, too.Like the changes introduced by Apple with the initial iOS 14 release last fall, these iOS 14.5 improvements aren't complete overhauls — just enhancements that build on what's already there. The result is an iOS update you'll be able to install and use without any stumbles, but with new features that promise to improve your iPhone experience.It feels like I've been testing iOS 14 for ages at this point, but it really started with the developer beta dropping during the summer of 2020. When the iOS 14.5 beta arrived a few months ago, I installed that on a bunch of phones, too, so that I'm pretty familiar with all the changes Apple's brought about with its latest update.I remain a satisfied iOS user, especially after the release of iOS 14.5 and the arrival of some valuable new tools. As before, iOS 14.5 continues Apple's big step forward, even if some features need more time to fully develop.iOS 14.5 is available as a free over-the-air update. To download iOS 14.5, go to the Settings app on your iPhone, select General and then Software Update. From there, you can follow the on-screen instructions.After we posted this updated iOS 14.5 review, Apple rushed out iOS 14.5.1 to patch two fairly significant security loopholes. If you have upgraded to iOS 14.5, you should make sure to get the latest update, too — it's available in the same manner that you would download iOS 14.5As with the original iOS 14 release, you’ll need an iPhone 6s or later to run iOS 14.5. (The original iPhone SE and the 7th gen iPod touch are also on the list of compatible devices.) That means if you bought a flagship iPhone as far back as the fall of 2015, you can still run the latest version of Apple’s mobile software. If you've got an iPhone 6s, 6s Plus or original iPhone SE (the model that came out in 2016), this may be your final chance to stay current with iOS updates, as rumors suggest those three phones will be cut off from iOS 15 this coming fall.For my iOS 14.5 review, I've tested the software update on an original iPhone SE, an iPhone 11 Pro Max and an iPhone 12. While the update sings on those newer models, older phones shouldn't have a problem running iOS 14.5, though my iPhone SE's battery is beginning to notice the strain. (The fact that I bought the phone two presidential administrations ago may be causing that, too.)Even with the new features iOS 14.5 ushers in, widgets remain the most significant addition of this update cycle, at least for the iPhone. (iPadOS 14 users never got this feature, as we detailed in our iOS 14 vs. iPadOS 14 comparison, though iPadOS 15 rights that wrong.) Widgets offer at-a-glance information to the kind of data you’d want instantaneously, without forcing you to launch an app — think the current temperature, upcoming appointments or maybe the latest headlines and sports scores. Before iOS 14, widgets have lived on the Today screen, which still forces you to scroll rightward until you run out of home screens. The new iPhone software saves you the trouble, by letting you place Widgets right on your home screen where they live among your apps.Even better, Apple offers multiple designs for the same widget, which look richer and in some cases provide more information than they did in iOS 13. The weather widget, for example, can be a simple square that shows the current temperature, a rectangular box with an extended forecast or a much larger block that tacks on hourly forecasts. The size of the widget you choose is up to you.I’ve set up my Home screen so that there’s a weather widget tucked in among my favorite apps, so I can see the temperature at my current location. At different points in my testing, I had a screen of nothing but widgets — one dedicated to headlines from Apple’s News app, another showing me what's up next in my TV app queue, and finally, a Smart Stack pulling info from Photos, Calendar and other built-in apps. (More on Smart Stack in just a bit.)You have multiple ways to add widgets. You can press on one in the Today screen until the Edit Home Screen option appears, before dragging the widget to where you want it. When a Home screen is in edit mode, a Plus button appears in the upper right corner; tap it and you’ll get an array of widgets in various shapes and sizes.Changing a widget’s size isn’t as intuitive as it could be initially. From that widget menu that appears after pressing the Plus button, you can either tap on the sample widgets at the top of the screen or scroll-down to select the name of the built-in app to pick whichever widget you want. Now that iOS 14 has been out for a while, more third-party widgets are available, though you have to do some digging sometimes to find them. The easiest method is to press anywhere on your iPhone's display to edit the Home screen and tap the plus button that appears in the upper right corner. You'll see a sampling of widgets both for Apple's built-in apps as well as from any apps installed on your phone.The widget menu is also where you’ll find the option for creating a Smart Stack, a name Apple’s given to a curated collection of widgets for iOS 14’s built-in apps. Tap the Smart Stack option — it's at the top of the widget list, just below the sampling of widgets — and you have the option to pick the apps to be included in your Smart Slack before placing it anywhere on one of your Home screens. (Here's a guide on how to create a Smart Stack widget.)The Smart Stack changes dynamically, bringing up the glanceable info you need at certain points of the day, with iOS 14 learning your behavior. So far, my calendar appointments appear in my Smart Stack in the morning, then later in the day, I might see headlines or a photo selected from my library. I can also scroll through the Smart Stack to get to the widget I want.I think widgets are practically worth the price of admission alone for the iOS 14 update. If I have one complaint, it’s that they’ve made a mess out of the Today screen — which still exists to the left of your main Home screen. Apple prioritizes iOS 14’s “new” widgets, placing them above the widgets you’ve got left over from iOS 13. Until those third-party widgets are updated for iOS 14, they’re stuck on the Today screen, and you’ve got to scroll down to see them.I’ve still got some useful pre-iOS 14 widgets there — one for seeing upcoming transit times, another for triggering the iOS version of the Google Assistant app, and I don’t care for the fact that Apple has elbowed them out of the way with this update. Even six months after iOS 14's initial launch, the problem persists, even as developers have added iOS 14-friendly widgets. It feels like a step back in some ways.The nature of my job means I download a lot of apps, but even if you don’t visit the App Store as frequently as I do, your approach to app management is probably the same as mine. You download the app, it lands wherever there’s a free space on one of your Home screens, and you promptly forget where it is until the next time you need to launch it. Yes, we all make sure to keep our frequently used apps on the first Home screen, and maybe even the second, but after that? The app might as well be in the next county.Apple has spotted how we’re doing things, and Apple would like us to clean up our act. That’s why another big highlight of iOS 14 is the new App Library, which gathers all of the apps on your phone into one place.It’s a pretty well-organized place, too. The top two folders in the App Library showcase Suggestions — again based on the apps you typically use and when you’re likely to use them — and Recently Added, which does what it says on the label. Below that, your apps are organized by category, with most frequently used apps appearing first. Tapping a cluster of apps reveals the full list. If you’d rather not hunt and peck, there’s a search bar at the top.App Library offers a much more sensible approach to app management than in previous iterations of iOS.You access the App Library by swiping left from your last Home screen, and the feature wouldn’t be much use if you still had to travel across a wasteland of app pages just to get to the screen to better manage all that software. iOS 14 gives you the option of hiding extraneous screens from view. When you’re editing your home screen, tap on the row of buttons just above the dock. All your pages will appear as thumbnails, and you can unclick the ones you want hidden. The apps remain on your phone, but the screen clutter disappears.This is a much more sensible approach to app management than in previous iterations of iOS. My one complaint is that the only method provided to edit your home screen is to drag icons around on your phone itself. That can be hard to do, as apps on the edge of the screen have an unfortunate habit of darting over to the next page. I had a very hard time moving those apps on my iPhone SE, and even a minor bit of difficulty dragging them from the edge of the iPhone 11 Pro Max's larger screen.Apple dropped app management features from iTunes about three years ago, and iTunes itself has been a goner since macOS Catalina. I wish Apple would re-introduce a less frustrating method than physically dragging and dropping apps, especially now that iOS 14 shows the company is serious about having us curate our Home screens more thoughtfully.Messages has become one of the more popular built-in apps on the iPhone, even more so as people look for ways to stay in touch. So it was no surprise to see Message receive some of the more substantive changes among Apple’s returning apps when iOS 14 debuted last fall. In particular, Apple has focused on group chats, which have become handy ways to communicate with a lot of friends and family at once.Some changes are cosmetic, but still helpful. You can now assign images — be it photos, emoji or animoji — to distinguish one group chat from the others. It’s not a major addition, to be sure, but it’s a handy visual cue that lets you pick out chats at a glance instead.More important additions to group chats are inline replies and mentions. The former feature lets you reply to specific texts, removing some of the confusion when lots of people are weighing in on a conversation, while the latter can ping you when there’s a specific thread or text in a message that demands your attention. Again, both enhancements should make group texts easier to manage.But I think my favorite change in Messages is the ability to pin conversations — you can select up to nine and they’ll remain at the top of the Messages app for easy access. The feature works across all your Apple devices, though I haven’t upgraded to macOS Big Sur to check this out. Tapbacks and unread replies circle above the pinned conversation. At first glance, it sounds like a minor organization improvement, but it’s easy to manage and it keeps your most important conversations close at handApple introduced some changes to Maps when iOS 14 first debuted, and the changes have kept on coming through iOS 14.5. The latest addition allows you to report accidents, road hazards and speed traps, just like you would in the third-party Waze app.The new reporting feature is implemented sensibly, too. Yes, you can manually tap buttons by swiping up when getting directions in Maps, where the Report button joins existing options like Add Stop, Share ETA and Details. Just say ""Hey Siri, report an accident,"" and the digital assistant will do the rest.But most of the time, Apple figures you're going to be driving when reporting accidents and hazards, so it allows Siri to do the hard work for you. Just say ""Hey Siri, report an accident,"" and the digital assistant will do the rest. In my experience, an icon depicting the incident you've just reported pops up in Maps fairly quickly.Apple continues to build out another iOS 14 addition in the form of Guides, which offer curated write-ups on places to visit and things to see that can help you plan vacations or just figure out if there’s something worth seeing in your vicinity.Initially, Guides have been limited to some pretty frequently visited locations (think New York and LA), but they've expanded to other areas, with content provided by more sources, including Lonely Planet and the Nature Conservancy. It's the sort of thing that really helps with discovery, especially since you can save guides alongside any collections of favorite locations you’ve created in Maps.Another welcome addition if you use a bicycle to get from Point A to Point B is the arrival of the Cycling option to route planning. (There’s also a route planner for electric vehicles, but you’ll need a compatible vehicle for this feature to appear.)These are more than just turn-by-turn directions for bikes. Apple lets you know if you’ll be using a bike lane or if you’re sharing the road with cars. Your proposed route can flag if there are times when you’ll have to walk your bike and a handy elevation tool warns if you’ve got a steep climb ahead. You can even tell Maps to avoid routes with hills, heavy vehicle traffic or stairs.To see just how much thought Apple has put into the Cycling directions, swipe up on a route. That normally shows potential stops along the way, such as coffee shops or places to eat. For bike routes, Maps includes any bike repair shops, too.In fact, there are some elements of Cycling routes that I wish Apple would integrate into Maps’ other routing options. That elevation warning would also be handy for plotting out walking directions, which I say as someone who once decided to get a good walk in on my way to a meeting only to realize that Maps’ route had me climbing up one of the steepest hills in San Francisco.Cycling directions were limited to select cities when iOS 14 launched, but Apple's added more areas over time. If you're a cyclist, you really should check out this feature if you're living in one of the covered locales.A newcomer to iOS 14 is Translate, which promises to translate phrases and even conversations from 11 different languages. The main interface lets you speak or type words, phrases and sentences that it can translate into both text and audio. Star any favorites for words and phrases you use frequently, and they’ll be saved to a separate tab.The real magic with Translate happens when you flip your iPhone into landscape mode and the screen splits into two separate languages, with the app able to tell who’s speaking what language and adding a translation on the appropriate side of the screen. (You will need to select your languages before starting a conversation, though, as if someone starts speaking Spanish when French and English are the selected languages, you’ll have one confused Translate app.)Apple calls this landscape orientation Conversation mode because two people speaking different languages can have their words translated. You wouldn’t want to use Translate for a lengthy conversation, though, as you’ve got to tap the microphone each time one of you speak — there’s no free-flowing exchange of views here. That can make Translate a little bit awkward to use.The translation seems to work well enough in my testing, though Translate seems to depend on very precise pronunciations and accents. My wife, who can sprechen enough Deutsch to get by, said “Good eating keeps your soul together,” in German, which Translate took to mean “LeBron has good food and drink.” (That must be great comfort to the Laker star.) One feature you’ll appreciate with Translate is that you can download languages to keep them stored on your iPhone. This is helpful for when you’re traveling and you may not have an internet connection, but more importantly, it means that all the translation is taking place on your device, keeping all your words private whatever the language.The translation skills don’t stop with this standalone app. Safari has picked up a knack for languages, with the ability to translate web pages from seven different languages. The feature was in beta at iOS 14s launch, though Apple seems to have dropped that label over time. Regardless, I've found Safari's translation feature to be pretty polished. Just tap on the ""aA"" icon in the URL bar and select Translate from the drop-down menu. The website will now appear in English, and remain that way even when you click on internal links.Apart from widgets, this may be one of my favorite changes, as it addresses a long-standing design flaw.Compact notifications is one of my favorite changes in iOS 14, as it addresses a long-standing design flaw.I used to dread getting a phone call on my iPhone, and it’s not just because it’s likely a robocall. Rather, an incoming call took you right out of you’re doing, whether it’s browsing the web, playing a game or reading an email, replacing that activity with an incoming call notification that filled the entire iPhone screen.Starting with iOS 14's release last fall, call notifications now appear in a box at the top of the screen. Tap the green button to pick up or the red one to dismiss the call, but now your entire iPhone screen won’t be taken over the next time someone tries to give you a ring.Siri follows the lead of incoming phone calls in iOS 14. Instead of taking you to a separate Siri screen when you want to do something like launch an app or get a quick weather update, all you have to do is summon Siri. A round Siri icon appears at the bottom of the screen, and whatever reply Siri comes up with shows up at the top. It’s an elegant way to include Apple’s digital assistant without taking you out of your flow.Interface improvements aren’t the only change to Siri, as a new version of iOS revives Apple’s claim that Siri is smarter than ever before. Apple says that Siri has been filled with 20 times the facts it knew just three years ago, and after using the iOS 14 version of the digital assistant for the last six months, I'm inclined to agree that this is the least frustrating iteration of Siri yet.Siri seems smarter, though not foolproof, and still not as seamless to use as the Google Assistant. Questions like “What’s the air quality index?” “Who’s leading the American League West?” and “What films did Malcolm McDowell make?” produced definitive on-screen answers. Asking Siri who won the Emmy for best actor in a drama in 1984 produced the ubiquitous “Here’s what I found on the web” result. (Google Assistant knows it’s Tom Selleck.) Siri also sent me to the web when I wanted to know how to brunoise an onion. It’s still hit and miss, though the misses are becoming fewer. Siri is also getting better at correcting you when you give it an unrecognized command. When I was testing the reporting feature in Maps, I absentmindedly told Siri to report road construction; the assistant helpfully reminded me that it can only report hazards, accidents and speed traps.Going forward, Siri will stop defaulting to a female voice — a welcome change.Apple touts a number of other Siri tweaks here and there, which have continued with the arrival of iOS 14.5. In the new version, Siri can launch group calls in FaceTime, and that joins earlier additions like asking for cycling directions through Maps or sharing estimated arrival times. You can also record audio messages via Siri, a feature that was a little fussy when I first tested it, but that's improved over time.iOS 14.5 brings two new American voice options to Siri, in an effort to make the assistant feel more inclusive. (Here's a guide on how to activate any of Siri's new voices.) Going forward, Siri will stop defaulting to a female voice, requiring you to choose your digital assistant's voice at setup. It's a minor change, but a welcome one that combats the inherent sexism of assuming you want a female-voiced assistant to do your every bidding.There's been a coronavirus pandemic on for the entirety of iOS 14's existence —  and one of the knock-on effects has been that unlocking your iPhone has become much more complicated. If you're using an iPhone X or later, you've come to rely on Face Time for unlocking your iPhone, but with your face covered by a mask, that feature simply won't work. You can tap out your passcode to unlock your phone, and subsequent iOS updates have sped up that process, but it's not a very elegant way of doing things. Fortunately, iOS 14.5 has introduced a way to unlock your phone without removing your face mask — provided you've got an Apple Watch.I'm not a smartwatch wearer, but my wife is. And she's really impressed by how easy iOS 14.5 has made unlocking her phone when she's wearing her Apple Watch 4. We've got a full guide on how to unlock your iPhone with your Apple Watch, but basically, all you have to do is turn on the feature in Settings, make sure you're wearing your watch, and have the watch unlocked. Then, when you glance at your phone, all you have to do is swipe up to unlock it. You can even lock your phone from your Apple Watch with this feature enabled.This is not a feature that will mean a lot to users who don't own an Apple Watch. But it's a welcome addition to the ones who do, and it shows that Apple is constantly looking for ways to make the iPhone experience more seamless.After widgets and the App Library, the biggest change to apps introduced with iOS 14 is a feature that allows you to partially download apps only to use specific tasks, like paying for a parking space or sharing a list. Apple calls this feature App Clips, and six months after its debut, I'm still not convinced App Clips serves any purpose.When the feature first launched, my colleague Adam sent me a grocery list using the Pocket Lists app, with an invitation to share the list arriving via Messages. Yet, when I clicked on the full link, I was taken to the App Store to download the complete app. This is not the App Clips experience I had in mind. Since then, I've rarely run into situations where I've had cause to use an App Clip or even to seek one out.That speaks to one of the biggest complications involving App Clips — this is a feature that depends on app makers implementing it and making it clear to users just what to expect when they tap on that link. It also puts a premium on app discovery since the whole point of App Clips is exposing us to functions and features we didn’t know we needed from apps we wouldn’t otherwise be using. In the early days of iOS 14, it seemed like there’s more work to be done in this regard, and that's a feeling that hasn't changed now that we're at iOS 14.5.We could keep walking through each and every change included in the new software, especially with iOS 14.5 adding new capabilities. But at this rate, we'll need to break up the review into a separate volume. Instead, let’s tackle some of the remaining highlights that merit a mention for how they might change your iPhone experience.Picture-in-picture video: The multitasking feature that’s been a part of the iPad makes it over to Apple’s phones in iOS 14. Now when you watch a video, you can tap a button in the playback window to turn it into a floating window that follows you as you move on to different apps.You can drag the window around the screen if it’s covering up that email you’re composing or that text message you’re trying to read, and you can resize the window to a point. (You’ve got to retain the same aspect ratio as the video that’s playing.) Obviously, it's a feature that's a lot more handy on an iPhone with a larger screen. Picture-in-picture has been limited to built-in media players like Apple’s TV app, Podcasts and FaceTime, but third-party apps are able to adapt it using a developer tool that Apple offers. That apparently doesn’t include YouTube, which is restricting picture-in-picture functionality to YouTube Premium accounts as of this writing.Reminders: Create a list of to-dos in the Reminders app in iOS 14, and you’ll be able to share that list with other users (provided they’re running iOS 14 as well, of course.) It works a lot like the similar share feature that’s been a part of Notes for a while now. As of iOS 14.5, you get a new Sort By option that lets you re-arrange reminders by everything from due date to priority to title.Podcasts: iOS 14.5 also introduces a new, much improved look for Apple's built-in Podcasts app, initiated by Apple's plans to launch Podcasts Subscriptions. The show page has been redesigned to give you easier access to playback controls and episode lists. A redesigned Up Next section makes it easier to manage and share downloads, too.Beefed-up privacy tools: Apple is understandably proud of the number of privacy improvements iOS 14 introduces, including iOS 14.5's addition of an App Tracking Transparency feature that gives you more granular control over what apps can keep tabs on your activities. Apps are now required to ask your permission for tracking you, and the App Store contains a privacy section that details just what information apps are collecting.Voice Memo improvements: An Enhance Recording feature in the Voice Memos app promises to improve the audio of your recordings by downplaying any background noise. The feature appears as a magic wand icon on the screen where you edit your recordings, and you enable it with a simple tap. I recorded a voice memo with some loud music playing in the background, and while the drums and horns were still evident in the recording, the Enhance Recording feature did minimize them, even if the final recording featured a pronounced echo. It’s good enough for transcription purposes, though. Magnifier app: If you have a hard time reading the fine print on something, you've likely used the Magnifier feature on your iPhone. (Triple press the side button on the iPhone X or later, or triple press the home button on older iPhones to launch the feature.) In iOS 14, Magnifier is split out into its own app, with tools for both zooming in and adjusting brightness. You can also snap images without saving them to your camera roll if you prefer. And yes, the old triple-press trick still works for launching Magnifier if you have a hard time learning new tricks.Revamped Weather app: Apple bought Dark Sky this year, and the Weather app in iOS 14 is reaping the benefits. Users in the U.S. can now see a minute-by-minute chart that shows just how much rain or snow to expect in the next hour, and there are warnings when temperatures are forecast to shift dramatically from day to day. Living on the West Coast, I’ve found the prominent display of adverse air-quality conditions to be particularly helpful during these, the end times we live in.Camera and Photos changes: Go to the photo app, and tap a photo you like. Swipe upward and you'll see a field for adding captions. I can see this being an interesting tool for adding details and memories about your shot, but I'm not sure if there's a wider application for it just yet. Meanwhile, the Camera app promises faster performance between shots while adding toggles to let you quickly adjust video resolution and frame rate.Spatial audio for AirPods Pro: I still don’t have a set of wireless earbuds — in my day, you plugged in earbuds, sonny — but my colleague Henry T. Casey does, and he’s quite impressed with the spatial audio feature iOS 14 delivers to AirPods Pro. Spatial audio promises dimensional experiences for your ears, so you move around the sound of the show or movie you're watching, and Henry says that’s very much the case; my deteriorating hearing will just have to take his word for it.Improved search: I used to use the Search feature on the iPhone to look up apps and launch them and while I can still do that in iOS 14, the search bar brings up so much more. If it’s stored on your phone, basically, you can bring it up through search. When I type “magnum” into the search bar, for example, I not only get suggested websites, but also texts in Messages that I’ve sent to the people I do a Magnum PI podcast with, along with notations I’ve made for future episodes in the Notes app.Really, the vast array of iPhone users out there has already answered this question. As of the end of last year, Apple said 81% of iPhone owners were running iOS 14, and I imagine that percentage has only ticked upward during 2021. Any bugs that appear have been quickly stamped out — note how quickly Apple got the vital iOS 14.5.1 update out the door — and iOS 14.5 has run smoothly on all my tester phones throughout the two-month beta period. This is one stable update.Even more important, it's a valuable update, particularly with iOS 14.5's additional features and enhancements. The moment you upgrade, you’re going to enjoy some very welcome improvements to the iOS experience. The changes to current apps are thoughtful and useful, and new translation features add welcome capabilities to your iPhone. Some features, like App Clips, still have yet to make an impact, but the new widgets and App Library make your iPhone’s home screen a more welcome place to be. iOS 14 doesn’t just feature some of the biggest changes Apple’s introduced to its iPhone in some time, it also rolls out some of the best improvements in recent years, and that's only continued with the latest updates."
55,Moto G Power,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/moto-g-power,"Editors' Note: This review looks at the Moto G Power released by Motorola in 2020. The phone maker has since come out with a new version, the Moto G Power (2021), that features the long-lasting battery and price, in addition to a sub-$200 version. Read our Moto G Power (2021) review to see how that new phone measures up to this model.The Moto G Power that came out in 2020 had a tough act to follow. Its predecessor, the Moto G7 Power, was a bargain hunter's dream phone, delivering the best battery life of any mobile device while only costing $249. That's a package that should get anyone's attention, so it's no wonder the Moto G7 Power had been a mainstay on our list of the best cheap phones.Starting price: $249 OS: Android 10 Screen size (Resolution): 6.4-inch LCD (2300 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 665 RAM: 4GB Storage: 64GB Expandable: Yes, up to 512GB Rear Cameras: 16MP main (f/1.7), 8MP ultra wide angle (f/2.2), 2MP macro (f/2.2) Front Camera: 16MP (f/2.0) Battery Size: 5,000 mAh Battery Life (Hrs:Mins): 16:10 Size: 6.3 x 3 x 0.38 inches Weight: 7 ouncesFor the 2020 model, Motorola didn't change those two key features. The Moto G Power still has the 5,000-mAh battery that helped the previous version of this phone outlast the competition. And at the time of its launch, you could get the Moto G Power for the same $249 price as before.If you hate paying big bucks for your smartphones, you really should consider the Moto G Power, even when taking budget options from Apple, Google and OnePlus into consideration. While battery life remains the main selling point here, our Moto G Power review found enough additional benefits like solid performance and good-for-their-price cameras that make this phone even more of a steal than it was before. About the only reason not to consider this model is that there's a newer version — the Moto G Power (2021) — which also lasts a long time on a charger and comes in a cheaper version.Even with the newer Moto G Power (2021) available, you can still find the 2020 edition of the Moto G Power at retailers and carriers. Google Fi, for example, continues to sell this version of the Moto G Power, though at a substantial discount from its regular price of $249. You can also buy the phone unlocked from Motorola, and retailers including Amazon, Best Buy and B&H Photo. If you do opt for the 2020 edition of the Moto G Power, make sure you're getting it at a discounted price. Not only does the Moto G Power (2021) have the same $249 price as this phone, you can also find a $199 version of the newer model that features less RAM. You will not mistake last year's Moto G Power for a flagship device, particularly when you pick up the phone. It's not that Motorola's phone looks bad — it's just that the G Power uses a plastic chassis and there's not a lot you can do to disguise that. Motorola has given this phone a glossy finish on the back, which adds some polish to the phone's looks.If you dislike the trend toward big, blocky camera arrays, you'll appreciate how the Moto G Power handles its trio of rear lenses. They descend vertically down the left side of the phone with the main shooter all by itself. The ultra wide angle and macro lenses are in a separate bump along with the phone's flash. That leaves space in the center of the phone for an easy-to-find fingerprint sensor.As for the front camera, Motorola has placed it inside a punch-hole cutout in the upper left corner of the phone's 6.4-inch display. That has allowed Motorola to shrink the Moto G Power's bezels, though they haven't gone away completely, particularly on the bottom of the screen.The 5,000 mAh battery that serves as the Moto G Power's calling card also makes this a chunky phone. The G Power measures 6.3 x 3 x 0.38 inches, making it larger than the 5.7 x 2.7 x 0.3-inch Pixel 4a, particularly when it comes to thickness. At 7 ounces, the Moto G Power is relatively weighty, too, outweighing both the Pixel 4a (5.04 ounces) and Nokia 7.2 (6.35 ounces).You'll get a 3.5mm headphone jack on the Moto G Power, an increasingly rare but still welcome sight. Motorola says the phone is ""water repellant,"" but there's no IP rating. I'd guess that light spray and the odd sprinkle will likely pose no threat, but don't drop this phone in the pool.If there's one area where the Moto G Power really comes across as a budget phone, it's the phone's display. Motorola uses an LCD panel, which you'd expect in a sub-$300 phone. The 6.4-inch screen features Full HD+ resolution, which again is pretty standard on a phone of this kind.My issue with the Moto G Power screen is that colors don’t look vibrant on the phone's display. Watching the No Time to Die trailer on the Moto G Power, scenes looked particularly shadowy, even when brightly lit. A close-up on Daniel Craig's face looked especially dark on the Moto G Power's screen, when it appeared better lit on other phones I've been using lately. Similarly, some older clips from Conan O'Brien's show looked a little blown out on the Moto G Power's display.Our lab testing backed up my hands-on impressions. The phone showcases just 97% of the sRGB color spectrum in its default setting (which, ironically, is the saturated mode). That's consistent with other phones in the latest Moto G series, including the Moto G Fast (97%) and Moto G Stylus (98%). To put that in perspective, the Nokia 7.2, another LCD-equipped budget phone, managed to capture 153% of the colors.At least the colors on the Moto G Power are fairly accurate, given its Delta-E rating of 0.33. (The closer the number is to zero, the better.) That's about what last year's Moto G7 Power (0.35) was able to deliver.While the colors on the Moto G Power screen didn't impress me, the display's brightness was more than satisfactory. We measured brightness at 500 nits for the Moto G Power, just ahead of the average for smartphones. Both the Pixel 4a and iPhone SE are brighter, at 681 nits and 653 nits respectively, but when using the Moto G Power outside, I never had to crank up the display to maximum brightness just to see the screen.Go back to just a few years ago when putting more than one camera on a budget phone was unthinkable. These days, Motorola has stuck three lenses on the back of the Moto G Power. And while they're not going to produce photos that surpass what you can get from the latest iPhone 12 and Pixel 5 models, the Moto G Power cameras hold their own against the best budget shooters — so much so, that we included the Moto G Power among the best camera phones at one point. It's hard to find a better camera on a phone that costs less than $300, though the Moto G Power (2021) tries with a more powerful main lens.The main camera on the back of the older Moto G Power is a 16-megapixel camera with an f/1.7 aperture. That's augmented by an 8MP ultra wide angle shooter with a 118-degree field of view plus a 2MP macro camera. The lack of a telephoto lens on the Moto G Power means that any zooming in you do will be digital and likely not as sharp as what an optical zoom can produce.So how do the Moto G Power's cameras fare in real-world testing? To find out, I pitted the new Moto phone against a Pixel 3a XL. The Pixel 4a hadn't come out yet when we tested this phone, and Google's 3a lineup boasted the best budget camera phones we had tested in the past year.In the case of this photo of some California poppies that have sprung up in my backyard, it's clear the more expensive Pixel 3a XL takes the better shot. It's better able to contend with the shadow cast over my yard, keeping the flowers in the background as focused as the ones in the forefront. The Moto G Power's image is brighter, but the flower petals aren't as sharp and the shot doesn't seem as balanced as what Google's phone produced.Switching to the macro lens on the Moto G Power, we see the benefits of that dedicated camera. I could get up close to one of the poppies and get a fairly detailed shot, with noticeable patterns on the flower's petals. The edges of those petals are a little jagged, though, so it's not quite the perfect pic.Moving inside to take a picture of dinner, the Moto G Power gets the better of the Pixel 3a XL in terms of color. Google's phone struggled with the light coming in from my dining room window, and as a result, the photo has a bluish cast, which is particularly evident on that buttered bread in the background. The Moto G Power's photo is brighter, and the colors more true to life, though some of the pieces of sausage and the dab of mustard aren't kept in focus. Even with its less pleasing color, the Pixel's shot is in focus and more detailed.Neither the Moto G Power or Pixel 3a has a dedicated telephoto lens for optical zooms, but I wanted to see how the software on both phones dealt with a zoomed-in shot of a Coast Guard boat docked across the channel from where I live. (I approximated a 3x zoom on both phones, as there's no number readout on the Google phone as you zoom in.)The Pixel 3a XL continues to bathe everything in a blue light, which affects everything from the white boat to the gray clouds. The Moto G Power produces more realistic colors, but the letters and numbers on the side of the boat aren't as sharp. Score a win for the Super Res Zoom feature on Google's Pixel phones.One thing the Moto G Power can do that Google's Pixel 3a lineup can't, though, is zoom out. I switched to the ultra wide angle on the Motorola phone to capture more of the surrounding landscape around the Coast Guard ship. The result is an impressive skyscape, though the objects in the far background — like the ship itself — have lost focus.The Moto G Power is at a disadvantage when the lights go down, as it lacks a dedicated Night mode. (You will find that feature on the Moto G Stylus, the G Power's slightly pricier sibling.) A photo of an after-hours stuffed animal party in my backyard illustrates just what you're giving up by foregoing a budget phone capable of nighttime photography.The Pixel 3a XL keeps the atmospheric red lighting of the scene while balancing the white lamp in the background and keeping all the stuffies in focus. The Moto G Power manages to capture some of the scene, thanks to the ambient lighting, but it's not terribly detailed and too murky. (I also took a shot using the Moto G Power's flash, which produced a much clearer shot, although all the lighting effects were wiped out.)I'm not impressed by the Moto G Power's take on portrait shots. The bokeh in this photo of my daughter seems haphazardly applied, with the upper left corner of the bottlebrush bush behind her not even blurred. You're able to adjust the blur and lighting effects to several different presets on the Moto G Power, but I suspect most users would just prefer to let the computational photography do the work for them. That certainly happens on the Pixel 3a XL, which also cuts in closer for its portrait shots.It's a similar story on selfies where the background blur on the Moto G Power isn't as polished as what you'll see from other phones. That said, the warmer colors on the Moto G Plus' selfie are more pleasing and accurate, even if the Pixel 3a XL did a better job preventing some sunlight off to the right from blowing out parts of my shirt.Some special features found in other Motorola phones make a return appearance on the Moto G Power. Spot Color uses on-board AI to filter out all but one color of a shot. The effect can be quite striking in some photos, like this picture of yellow and orange flowers where only the yellow remains. But I had my best luck using the feature with two contrasting colors — a photo of pink and purple flowers only flummoxed the Moto G Power.The Moto G Power also supports a Cinemagraph feature that lets you specify certain areas of a still shot that can include movement — essentially turning your photos into a GIF. I was pretty impressed by this photo where my wife is pouring a glass of wine — and you can see the wine pouring — at least until I noticed the vase in the background was also pulsing. Exactly what was in that wine?You don't buy a phone like the 2020 Moto G Power expecting a workhorse, but the Snapdragon 665 system-on-chip powering the phone should be more than enough to handle typical tasks. Motorola also includes 4GB of memory to help keep things peppy, though there’s only 64GB of storage. Need any more, and you have to turn to a microUSB card.On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the Moto G Power turned in a multicore score of 1,387. That's better than the 1,336 result produced by the Pixel 3a and its Snapdragon 670 processor, but not as good as the 1,498 result that we got from the Snapdragon 660-powered Nokia 7.2. For what it's worth, the newer Moto G Power with its Snapdragon 662 chipset, turned in a slightly better number than its predecessor with a 1,437 result in Geekbench.Both of the Nokia and Pixel phones outpaced the 2020 Moto G Power when it came time to test graphics using 3DMark's Sling Shot OpenGL test. The Moto G Power recorded an average score of 1,734, well behind the respective 2,054 and 2,543 results produced by the Nokia 7.2 and Pixel 3a.That said, I didn't run into any problems when using the Moto G Power to switch between apps, browse the web and do other basic tasks you'd expect a smartphone to handle. Even the demanding PUBG Mobile shooter played alright on the Moto G Power, despite a few choppy moments here and there. You'll find better performing phones than the Moto G Power, but they'll require you to pay up for the gain in performance.This is a new high score. Thanks to its 5,000 mAh battery, the Moto G Power lasted an epic 16 hours and 10 minutes on our web surfing battery test. That beats the Moto G7 Power by more than half-an-hour. Even the newer Moto G Power (2021) falls behind its predecessor (though that phone's 14-hour plus result is the second best result of currently available smartphones).Last year's Moto G Stylus — a phone with the same screen size and processor as the G Power but with a smaller 4,000 mAh battery — lasted 12 hours, 13 minutes on our test. As good as that result is, it's still nearly four hours shorter than the Moto G Power.Let's credit the Moto G Power's Snapdragon 665 chipset, which likely manages power more efficiently than the Snapdragon 632 in the Moto G7 Power. Whatever the reason, the Moto G Power has the best phone battery life of any handset we've tested, so you likely won't need to charge it after a day's worth of use.Just to give you an ideal on how impressive this result is in such an inexpensive phone, the TCL 10L costs the same as the Moto G Power and runs on the same Snapdragon system-on-chip. Yet, that phone only lasted 9 hours, 59 minutes on our test — the Moto G Power beat it by more than 6 hours.Other Moto G phones also fare well in our battery test, though the Moto G Power leaves them in the dust. The Moto G Fast lasted a very impressive 12 hours, 17 minutes, and the G Power still had it beat by nearly 4 hours.That extra long battery life is good, because when you need to re-charge the Moto G Power, you're going to need to block out some time to fill that 5,000 mAh power pack with the included 10-watt brick. After 15 minutes of charging a drained Moto G Power, I got the phone back to 10% power; that number grew to 21% after half-an-hour. Contrast that with the Pixel 4a, which has a much smaller 3,140 mAh battery to recharge. Yet, its included 18-watt charger gets the job done quicker, getting to half-capacity after 30 minutes.Motorola takes a light hand with the Android skin it puts on its phones, and that thankfully continues with the Moto G Power. You'll find Android 10 on this phone with very little embroidery, save for a prominently displayed Moto app that offers tips and tricks about using your new phone.If you've not used a Motorola phone before, those tips include your introduction to Moto Actions, which are actually helpful shortcuts for getting the most out of the Moto G Power.For instance, by quickly twisting your wrist twice, you can launch the camera app, which can be a real time-saver compared to unlocking your phone and launching the camera with a tap. Two chopping motions holding the Moto G Power turns on the phone's flashlight, which I also find helpful. I'm less enamored with Motorola's three-finger touch to take a screenshot.While the Moto G Power's Fingerprint sensor is easy to locate on the back of the phone, I found it to be less responsive than I normally prefer. It usually took at least two and sometimes three presses of my registered fingerprints for the Moto G Powers sensor to recognize that it was me trying to unlock the phone.Motorola can be stingy with Android updates. This particular phone is only now getting an update to Android 11, and that's probably it for major Android updates. (You'll still get security patches.) Of course, the Moto G Power (2021) holds no advantage here, as it also shipped with Android 10 and will be done with Android updates once Android 11 is installed.Just by retaining the long-lasting battery of the Moto G7 Power, the Moto G Power was already in the conversation for a must-have device for budget-conscious shoppers. But this phone isn't just counting on its longevity to win you over. It also performs well enough to meet the needs of the average smartphone user, and the cameras — while not the best you can find on a budget device — produced some pretty eye-catching shots during our testing for the Moto G Power review.If you value mobile photography above all, you may want to consider other low-cost options, especially now that the Pixel 4a is here and only $100 more than the Moto G Power. The iPhone SE 2020 is another strong option, with a more premium glass-and-metal design, better cameras and much faster A13 Bionic chip. But you'll need to pay at least $150 more for those mid-range phones than you would for the Moto G Power. The OnePlus Nord is another budget-minded phone that's fared well in initial battery tests (though nowhere near what the Moto G Power can offer). But that phone is only available in Europe and India at the moment, and the Moto G Power is still likely to cost less should OnePlus decide to bring the Nord to this country.The biggest competitor to the Moto G Power may be... the Moto G Power. The newer 2021 model didn't last as long on a charge in our testing, but its battery life still impresses and its components are one year newer than the the 2020 edition of the phone we're reviewing here. The Moto G Power remains a compelling option, especially if you can find a discounted price, but if you want the best Motorola has to offer, the Moto G Power 2021 is the better buy at this point."
56,Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra,"As far as “ultra” phones go, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is hard to comprehend. Its monolithic design, enormous cameras, stunning display and secondary rear display give it an unmistakable look — one that shows Xiaomi means business when it sets its sights on taking down its Samsung, OnePlus and Apple rivals.Starting price: TBA Display: 6.81-inch QHD AMOLED (3200 x 1440) Refresh rate: Adaptive, 30Hz/60Hz/90Hz/120Hz Rear display: 1.1-inch AMOLED (126 x 294) Rear cameras: 50MP main (f/1.95), 48MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 48MP telephoto (5x optical zoom, 120x max zoom, f/4.1) Front camera: 20MP (f/2.2) Chipset: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB Battery: 5,000mAh Charging: 67W wired, 67W wireless, 10W reverse wireless Operating system: Android 11 with MIUI 12 Size: 6.46 x 2.93 x 0.33 inches (164.3 x 74.6 x 8.38mm) Weight: 8.25 ounces (234g) Water/dust resistance: IP68Those specs aren’t just for ticking boxes either. All of them work as well as you’d expect, with a few, such as the QHD resolution, 120Hz panel, zippy 67W charging or the telephoto camera, offering class-leading performance. However, this model’s ultimate fate rests on how much Xiaomi wants to charge for it. The basic Xiaomi Mi 11 is already a great value, and uses several identical parts to the Mi 11 Ultra, so arguably the Ultra could be too expensive for its own good. However, with careful pricing, the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra could make itself the most accessible ultimate smartphone around.We know that the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra will be coming to the U.K, though it will skip the U.S., given Xiaomi’s ongoing dispute with the U.S. government over alleged risks to national security.Xiaomi has yet to name a date and price for the U.K. version of the Mi 11 Ultra. Given the basic Xiaomi Mi 11 costs £749, just a little less than the £769 Galaxy S21 or £829 OnePlus 9 Pro, it follows that the Ultra version would cost well over £1,000, perhaps similar to the £1,149 Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra and £1,099 iPhone 12 Pro Max.However, the price of the Ultra in India, the only market with an announced price so far, gives us hope. At 70,000 rupees, the Mi 11 Ultra costs less than a Galaxy S21 Plus, and the same as a OnePlus 9 Pro. We can't account for how regional differences will affect that price when it comes to the U.K., but if Xiaomi can afford to sell the Mi 11 Ultra for less than £1,000,, it would undercut its rivals significantly, and become an incredible bargain for the hardware it offers, even accounting for the already cheap Mi 11.You might mistake the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra for the basic Mi 11 from the front. The curved punch-hole display looks smart, but it's indistinct from both other Mi 11 models and other Android phones.Flip the phone over, and everything changes. You’re immediately drawn to the huge rectangular camera bump that stretches almost the entire width of the phone, and the top third of the back. The three large camera openings look foreboding, and that’s not to mention the secondary rear display sat to their right.The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra comes with a tough ceramic body, in either black or white. I prefer the white version since it helps the camera bumps stand out even more, but both colors look elegant and the Mi 11 Ultra should shrug off scratches better than a glass- or plastic-backed phone.Both the front and back of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra curve into the metal side rails, which makes it fit surprisingly well into your hand and comfortable to use even with just one hand. You’ll notice the weight of this phone the moment you pick it up, though.At more than 8 ounces, the Mi 11 Ultra is heavier than the Galaxy S21 Ultra or the iPhone 12 Pro Max, though I didn’t find it tough to use over long periods. What did get a little annoying however was how easy it is to snag the Mi 11 Ultra’s large camera bump on a jeans pocket, stopping you from putting the phone away as effortlessly as you’re likely used to.Xiaomi has equipped the Mi 11 Ultra with an exquisite display. The 6.81-inch AMOLED panel comes complete with a QHD resolution and a 120HZ maximum refresh rate and has a subtle curve on all four edges to make it easier to hold.If you prioritize battery life over refresh rate and resolution, Xiaomi has made it easy to tone down these settings. You can set the display to an FHD resolution instead, and the 120Hz resolution can dynamically scale down to 90Hz, 60Hz or 30Hz if the content you’re looking at won’t be hurt by a lower refresh rate.Watching the Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings trailer to try out the Mi 11 Ultra’s display, I was not disappointed. The floating water effects, neon lights and burning hot blade that all appear at various points in the trailer all looked fantastic, but as I watched the teaser for the next installment of the MCU, I had a nagging thought — the Mi 11 Ultra’s display is a bit underwhelming. It’s the exact same as the one on the Mi 11, which is far cheaper to buy.That means despite the display being one of the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s best features, the screen is not a good enough reason to pay up for this phone on its own.The displays don’t stop with the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s 6.81-inch main display. The back of the phone features a secondary 1.1-inch panel, about the size of a fitness band’s screen. You’ll find the secondary display within the camera bump, and it’s one of the Mi 11 Ultra’s signature features. Unfortunately, the display offers surprisingly limited functionality.With the phone locked, the rear panel acts as a miniature always-on display when you tap it, showing you the time, date, battery level and whether you have notifications. When the phone’s open, you can use the rear screen as a preview window for the rear cameras, allowing your subjects to see themselves before you hit the shutter button. Unfortunately, you can only enable this when in normal photo mode, not when taking portrait mode shots.Both of these are practical applications for a secondary display, putting us in mind of how the foldable Samsung Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola Razr use their mini external displays. I can’t say I’m convinced this is going to be the next hot trend in smartphone design though — it feels too light on features to make it worth adding a second screen. Plus the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s rear panel is very dim. Any above-average amount of light makes it impossible to read, particularly from extreme angles.The Mi 11 Ultra aims for camera quality over quantity, offering just three rear sensors. The ones that are there feature impressive specs. The main camera uses a 50MP sensor, with the ultrawide and telephoto cameras both featuring 48MP sensors. The telephoto camera, as text on the back of the phone reminds you, is capable of 120x zoom, although you’ll be better off sticking to its 5x optical or 10x hybrid zoom levels instead.The Mi 11 Ultra’s front camera has a 20MP sensor, but it almost doesn’t need to be there. The secondary display allows all the rear cameras to be practically used for selfies.To put the Mi 11 Ultra through its paces, I compared it with shots taken by the iPhone 12 Pro, one of the best camera phones around. In this first comparison of the phones’ main cameras, I took a shot of the London Eye that turns out to be a narrow win for the iPhone. The Mi 11 Ultra’s image is oddly dark, while the iPhone manages to capture the sky just as well as it recreates the detail of the Eye’s structure.In a slightly darker environment however, the Mi 11 pulls ahead. See how the colors of the leaves and grass in the sunken square of Paddington Central are much richer than that of the iPhone’s shot, plus how the Mi 11 Ultra still manages to capture the sky without the light blowing out the color.However when it’s a proper night mode shot, I think the iPhone has the edge. The Mi 11 Ultra’s image of the Euston Station war memorial is brighter but fails to capture the color of the sky or the street lamp light cast on the stonework in quite the same way as the iPhone.Switching to the ultrawide sensor, the Mi 11 Ultra’s larger sensor has produced a brighter image that also retains the detail of the light playing on the metal installation and concrete bridge above. However it is more obviously distorted than the iPhone’s image, which looks all right overall.The Mi 11 Ultra’s strongest photos come from its telephoto lens. Xiaomi’s phone has one of the largest, highest resolution sensors combined with a powerful periscope zoom, so it’s unsurprising to see that it takes a clearer image at 2x zoom than the iPhone’s 2x optical zoom lens does.Even increasing to 10x zoom, the Mi 11 Ultra still keeps the Elizabeth Tower, a.k.a. Big Ben, looking sharp, even from the other side of the River Thames.The maximum 120x zoom is impressive, as you can see below. However it’s not a good quality image, and I found it hard to aim without a tripod due to the subtle movements of your hand causing the view to bob and weave.The last test is to look at how the selfie camera performs. We see the Mi 11 Ultra’s image is not as saturated, and has a more subtle bokeh effect in the background. While I prefer how I look in the shot from the Xiaomi phone, the iPhone’s done a better job with the background.I also tried taking a selfie using the rear display and the Xiaomi’s main camera. This was fairly easy to manage on the Mi 11 Ultra, and resulted in the highest resolution selfie I’ve ever taken. It’s this kind of shot, along with the telephoto camera, that sets the Mi 11 Ultra apart from all other flagship phones. Even the images where I picked the iPhone version as the better one, there was nothing actually wrong with the shot from the Xiaomi. It seems safe to say the Mi 11 Ultra has earned the right to its colossal camera bump.Xiaomi has shoehorned a Snapdragon 888, 12GB RAM and 256GB storage into the Mi 11 Ultra. There aren’t many phones with better specs, so you can rest assured the Mi 11 Ultra will handle any app or game you want to run on it.On the Geekbench 5 app that measures general performance, the Mi 11 Ultra posted a single-core result of 1,136 points, and a multicore score of 3,724. That’s slightly ahead of the OnePlus 9 Pro (1,126 and 3,685) and the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra (1,123 and 3,440), but still a ways off the iPhone 12 Pro Max (1,603 and 4,111) and its all-conquering A14 Bionic chipset.Moving to the 3DMark graphic benchmark and its Wild Life Unlimited test, and the Mi 11 Ultra scored 5,617 points and managed an average of 33.8 frames per second. Comparing to the same phones as before, the OnePlus 9 Pro and S21 Ultra beat it (5,755 and 34.5fps, 5,739 and 34.37fps) as does the iPhone 12 Pro Max (9,113, 54fps).I tested the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s performance for myself by playing Mario Kart Tour, and I didn’t notice the performance gap between this Xiaomi device and the other phones. The game plays excellently, and Xiaomi’s Game Turbo software streamlines the phone’s performance to make sure you get the best from the device, and can play without being disturbed.The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is fitted with a 5,000 mAh battery, a hefty power pack for most phones. The Mi 11 Ultra’s battery is unique in that it uses nano silicon oxide, which allows it to stuff the same capacity into a smaller footprint compared to a traditional lithium-ion smartphone battery.I drained the battery with my informal YouTube binge-watching test, and after 6 hours of non-stop video, the Mi 11 Ultra had gone from 100% charge to 64% charge. As you'd expect from a phone with two screens, the main one being among the best currently on offer on any phone, the battery life takes a severe knock. Even with the phone sat on my desk with the always-on display enabled, Impressively, you can charge at the same 67W speed with a wired or wireless connection, assuming you have the right plug and Xiaomi's sold-separately charging stand. While you will get the wired charging block in the Mi 11’s box, sadly Xiaomi was unable to provide us with either of these for testing. Its own figures claim that charging with one of these fills the phone 100% full in only 36 minutes. That beats both the Galaxy S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro, neither of which come bundled with chargers. However, the latest OnePlus 9 flagships can pull off the same feat while taking a few minutes less, due to their dual-cell 4,500 mAh battery designs.The MIUI 12 spin on Android 11 is a good one, so we’re glad Xiaomi kept this interface for the Mi 11 Ultra. Xiaomi has successfully balanced the straightforward stock Android experience with its own exclusive features, such as floating windows, always-on displays, and an attractive look with nicely animated transitions.The only new feature worth mentioning is the options menu for the rear display, found within the special features section on the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra. It allows you to pick whether the display shows a clock, signature or image, what color it uses, which notifications show, if you want to turn it on with a double-tap and how long it stays on for before disappearing. You can also disable it completely, which seems like a waste of one of the phone’s biggest features.The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra is a powerful phone that’s either going to be the smartphone bargain of the year or repakcage what the Xiaomi Mi 11 already offers. Because of how generous Xiaomi was with the basic Mi 11, which shares the same main display and chipset while still offering competent photography, the Mi 11 Ultra offers less additional value to the Mi 11 compared to what a Galaxy S21 Ultra offers on top of a base Galaxy S21, for example. Therefore, Xiaomi will make or break the Mi 11 Ultra based on how much it charges for the new phone.This is a moot point for U.S. users, who still have to look at other phones by default, such as the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or OnePlus 9 Pro. U.K. users however could find themselves in one of two worlds. If Xiaomi sells the Mi 11 Ultra for around the £1,000 mark like the Indian retail price suggests, then we will be offered an Android phone with iPhone-rivalling photo quality, two displays and some of the fastest charging speeds around for the price of a mid-level Samsung flagship. It would be hard to deny the Mi 11 Ultra a spot on our best camera phones or overall best phones guides if this comes to pass.However if Xiaomi follows the example of the S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro Max and charges around £1,200, then the Mi 11 Ultra becomes an overgrown Mi 11 that doesn’'t offer the extra £400 to £500 of value. In this case, it's still a great phone, but one that gets outshone by the nearly identical Xiaomi Mi 11.If you're convinced of the utility of the extra display, the 67W charging and the power of the rear cameras, then buy a Mi 11 Ultra, you won't find these features replicated anywhere else any time soon. Most users in the market for a premium phone might want to wait though, in case we live in the timeline where Xiaomi is about to drop the best value flagship phone of the year."
57,Redmi Note 10 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/redmi-note-10-pro,"Starting price: £249 Display: 6.67-inch AMOLED FHD (2400 x 1080) Refresh rate: 60Hz/120Hz Rear cameras: 108MP main (f/1.9), 8MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 5MP telemacro (f/2.4), 2MP depth (f/2.4) Front camera: 16MP (f/2.45) Chipset: Snapdragon 732G RAM: 6GB/8GB Storage: 64GB/128GB with microSD slot Battery: 5,020 mAh Charging: 33W wired Operating system: Android 11 with MIUI 12 Size: 6.45 x 3.01 x 0.32 inches (164 x 76.5 x 8.1 mm) Weight: 6.8 ounces (193g) Water/dust resistance: IP53Bargain hunters shouldn’t overlook the Redmi Note 10 Pro. Although the model name makes this device like an off-brand Samsung handset, this budget-priced phablet offers some of the most desirable features on a smartphone while managing to undercut major rivals such as the OnePlus Nord N10 5G or the Google Pixel 4a.The Redmi Note 10 Pro features excellent specs across the board, from its 120Hz display to its 108MP main camera. The only real exception is the phone’s chipset, which lacks the oomph missing from similarly priced budget handsets.U.S. shoppers won’t be able to enjoy the Redmi Note 10 Pro’s stellar value. But in parts of the world where this phone is available, the Redmi Note 10 Pro vaults to the top of the best cheap phones list.If you’re in the U.K., you can buy the Redmi Note 10 Pro right now for £249. That only gets you the basic model with  6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. If you want 6GB/128GB instead, that’s £269. In the U.S., there’s no way to buy the Note 10 Pro, owing to the government’s ongoing dispute with Redmi’s parent company Xiaomi. Nothing is stopping you from importing this phone, but for this price, you’re better off picking a phone that is already available in American stores such as the OnePlus Nord N10 5G.“What a weird mix of textures.” That was the first thing I thought when I saw the Note 10 Pro. The color of the glass back doesn’t quite work with the metal sides, which is made even worse by the different color and texture of the top and bottom edges of the phone. Add to that the stepped camera block with metal surround, and Redmi’s phone feels too busy for my taste. For colors, you can choose Glacier Blue, Gradient Bronze and Onyx Grey (the color of my review unit). The bronze is my favorite option, both because it’s a good-looking hue that’s unusual among smartphones; it’s also got a matte texture. The Gray looks nice out of the box, but its glossy back proves to be a nightmare when it comes to picking up fingerprints.At least the Note 10 Pro is comfy to hold. You’d expect a handset of this size to feel unwieldy, but the sub-7-ounce weight and the curved back panel make it nice to hold and use. The Redmi Note 10 Pro is IP53 rated for water/dust resistance. In real terms, that means dust may enter the phone but won't interfere with its operation. The phone can withstand a spray of water, but don’t drop it into a sink or pool.With a 6.67-inch display, the Redmi Note 10 Pro delivers a lot of screen for your money. That panel also has a 120Hz maximum refresh rate, the same rate you’ll see in much more expensive flagship phones, and an acceptable FHD resolution. Put together, these display features almost justify the cost of the phone on their own.One word about the Note 10 Pro’s refresh rate: it’s static, with options for 60Hz and 120Hz only. While a variable rate like the kind found on the Samsung Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9 Pro would have been nice, that’s too big an ask for a phone this inexpensive.Watching the new trailer for Fast & Furious 9, the unbelievable action that defines the series seemed right at home on the Note 10 Pro’s screen, with the explosions and shiny, brightly colored cars all looking particularly exciting on the large display. That said, the screen’s not the brightest, even though it’s rated for 1,200 nits by Redmi itself, which made it hard to watch any videos in direct sunlight.Flip over the Redmi Note 10 Pro, and you’ll see four cameras, the highlight being the 108MP main camera, which is the same resolution found on the $1,200 Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. That lens is joined by an 8MP ultrawide angle camera, a 5MP telemacro lens and a 2MP depth sensor. There’s also one camera up front, a 16MP selfie cam located within a punch-hole cutout.To assess the abilities of these cameras, I compared the Redmi Note 10 Pro’s shots to the Motorola Moto g10. Motorola’s budget model also has five total cameras (48MP main, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro, 2MP depth and 8MP selfie), which all serve the same purpose as those on the Note 10 Pro, but for about £120 cheaper.This first image compares the two phones’ main sensors with a view over the Lower Pond at Waterlow Park in North London. The Redmi has an easy victory here by offering a brighter shot than the one captured by the Moto.I also tried out the phones’ night modes with these sensors with a view of Tufnell Park Underground station. Here it’s a more even comparison, but the Redmi’s image has kept the bloom from the street lamp in better check. That allows you to appreciate the dark sky better, making it my favorite of the two photos.For a test of the ultrawide sensors on both phones, I stood beneath this tree with white blossoms for my shots. We see the same difference between the two images that we did with the main cameras; the Moto g10 providing an acceptable shot, but the Redmi offering a more attractive, brighter one.This macro camera face-off is an easy win for the Redmi. It uses the same 5MP telemacro camera that the Xiaomi Mi 11 does, a sensor that got me to praise Xiaomi for doing macro shots right. The built-in magnification lets Redmi’s camera get a much clearer shot of this key, while the Moto’s struggles to deliver a similar amount of detail because of its smaller 2MP sensor.The depth sensor on both phones is used to add portrait effects to shots such as this one of me standing in my backyard. With both phones set to their highest bokeh setting, the Redmi and Moto deliver good blurring, except the Note 10 Pro also offers nicer colors and some attractive light spots.Our final shot compares two selfies in front of a tree back at Waterlow Park. This is too close to call since the Moto’s warmer color temperature makes for an inviting image in the same way that the extra detail of the Redmi’s higher resolution shot does.These comparisons show how spending just £120 more on your phone can result in much better photography. The Redmi likely wouldn’t stand up to a flagship-level phone in a face-off like this, but it’s again shown just how much quality hardware it offers for the asking price.The Note 10 Pro contains a Snapdragon 732G chipset, and 6GB or 8GB RAM. My review unit had 6GB RAM, so it won’t have the best possible performance that the Note 10 Pro line can offer. Results from the Geekbench 5 benchmarking app included a single-core average of 421 points and a multicore average of 1,521 for the Redmi Note 10 Pro. That beats the Moto g10’s single-core and multi-core scores of 247 and 1,330, respectively. It doesn’t quite meet the Google Pixel 4a’s 551 and 1,647 results.Running the 3DMark Wild Life graphics benchmark app, the Redmi achieved a score of 1,112 points with a 6.7fps average frame rate. That’s far better than the Moto g10 (250 1.5fps), but these still aren’t particularly mighty results.These scores made sense once I booted up Asphalt 9: Legends. There was little anti-aliasing around the edge of the cars, making them look weirdly blocky. I also noticed the background suddenly popping in at some points, a sure sign of a chipset that’s struggling to keep up. The only redeeming features were the frame rate, which thanks to the 120Hz display was smooth and reliable, and the powerful sound from the phone’s stereo speakers.There’s a huge 5,020 mAh battery in the Note 10 Pro, particularly for a phone of this price. Running down the battery using a particularly long playlist of YouTube videos played over WiFi, it took just over eight hours to get the phone from 45% full to empty. Assuming it drains at a consistent rate when full, that makes for around 18 hours total of video playback, which should translate for plenty of juice for your everyday tasks.To charge the Note 10 Pro, Redmi bundles in a 33W fast charger in the box. This powers the phone from empty to 27% in 15 minutes, to 56% in 30 minutes and to 100% in 65 minutes. It’s faster than a lot of phones, both around its price point and beyond. The comparably cheap Motorola Moto G Power (2021) fills its 5,000 mAh battery to 22% in half an hour, using a 10W charger. Meanwhile the gold standard for cheap phones, the Google Pixel 4a, makes it to 50% in 30 minutes with an 18W charger and a considerably smaller 3,140 mAh battery.Since the Redmi brand is part of Xiaomi, the Note 10 Pro gets to use MIUI 12, the company’s spin on Android 11. It’s attractive enough to use and is relatively light on bloatware, but lacks a few special features. For example, the Mi 11 was capable of opening apps in floating windows on top of another app, a handy feature that the Note 10 Pro can’t manage. The new phone also lacks the split notification shade that shows only your notifications or quick settings depending on which side of the display you swipe down on. Perhaps this is something Xiaomi will eventually roll out to Redmi devices, but it seems unfair to have software features like these but withhold them from users with cheaper handsets.You still have a few toys to play with though. Redmi offers a customizable always-on display and the choice of using an app drawer or home screens only to store all your apps. They’re welcome but are so common on other Android phones that they don’t curry the Redmi any extra favor.Redmi has produced the best kind of cheap phones with the Note 10 Pro — the kind that makes you question why so many people spend $1,000 or more for flagship phones when you can have so much of what you want for far less money.The Note 10 Pro ticks almost every box when it comes to desirable hardware, but doesn’t pack enough processing power to be a fully formed flagship killer. It makes an excellent choice for cash-strapped users who primarily use their phones for photos, thanks to its effective assortment of cameras, or streaming, because of the large 120Hz display. You can get better all-rounders in the budget market, such as Google’s reliable Pixel 4a, for not much more money, and of course, there’s no easy way to overcome the fact Redmi phones are not sold in the U.S. But if the price drops further or Xiaomi is allowed back into American stores, this is a phone you’d be foolish to not check out."
58,Galaxy A20,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a20,"OS: Android 9 Pie / One UIScreen size: 6.4-inch AMOLED (1560 x 720)Refresh rate: 60 HzCPU: Samsung Exynos 7904RAM: 3GBStorage / Expandable: 32GB / YesRear cameras: 13MP (f/1.9), 5MP (f/2.2) wideFront camera: 8MP (f/2.0)Video: 1080p at 30 FPSBattery: 4,000 mAhBattery life (Hrs:Mins): 13:46Charging: 15WColors: BlackSize: 6.24 x 2.94 x 0.3 inchesWeight: 5.86 ouncesDespite your misgivings, we encourage you to check out Samsung's budget offerings. Although in the past the company's low-cost handsets couldn't compete with any of the best phones around, newer models, like the Samsung Galaxy A51 and this Galaxy A20, adopt some of the elements found in Samsung's pricier devices. But these features now appear in a more affordable package.As the Galaxy A20 shows, you still make some trade-offs in performance, design and screen quality. But Samsung's latest budget phone also takes good photos and packs a long-lasting battery, making this device an intriguing option for budget-minded shoppers.You might also be tempted by the new Samsung Galaxy A21 if you're looking for improved photography capabilities. Samsung unveiled the next edition of the A20 with a quad-camera that includes a 16MP main camera and ultra wide, depth and macro lenses for more creative capturing. It will be available this summer starting at $249.99.We reviewed a version of the Galaxy A20 tied to Metro by T-Mobile, which once sold the phone for $239. T-Mobile also used to sell the Galaxy A20 for $250. Boost Mobile sold Samsung's budget phone as well. The phone has been supplanted by the newer Galaxy A21.The black-finish A20 comes in one configuration: 32GB of onboard storage and 3GB of RAM. You can boost storage to up to 512GB with a microSD.With its recent A-series releases, Samsung set out to design cheap phones that look just like the company's more expensive flagships. With a 6.4-inch display, superslim bezels and a top U-shaped notch casing a front-facing camera, the Galaxy A20 could be mistaken for a fancier phone. Like with the Galaxy A50, it's only after extensively handling the phone that Samsung's money-saving measures become obvious.While it doesn't feel cheap, the A20's plastic casing poses some potential problems. The back gathers more fingerprints than Gorilla Glass does. Plastic is also less durable than alternative materials.I tossed the phone in my bag on the commute home, and the device resurfaced with two unsightly scratches on the back. Considering I had no keys or miscellaneous sharp-edged objects in my purse, I was disappointed to learn the A20 can't protect itself from simple elements. If you're going to get the A20, buy a case.  The Galaxy A20 is the same size as A50, right down to its 6.4-inch AMOLED display. At 1560 x 720, the resolution isn't as sharp as the FHD+  panel on the A50, and those missing pixels tend to make their presence known rather quickly. Text, app icons and gestures look slightly jagged on the A20's display. When I watched the trailer for Top Gun: Maverick on a stable Wi-Fi network, Tom Cruise's chiseled features looked decidedly less chiseled. The display's low resolution isn't ideal for streaming video, whereas the $299 Moto G7's 2270 x 1080 picture is near perfect.Fortunately, the A20's color reproduction and brightness are solid for a budget phone. The handset covered 100% of the sRGB color space and earned a Delta-E accuracy score of 0.35 in our testing. (Delta-E scores closer to 0 are better.) Those numbers are pretty even with the Moto G7 Power's results and respectable for a budget-priced smartphone with an AMOLED display.MORE: Best Cheap Phones: Top Android Picks Under $300You also get a very bright screen with the Galaxy A20, which hit 465 nits on a light meter. That falls just below the smartphone average of 488 nits, but the display is bright enough that you can see it on a sunny day. The A20 also features a convenient dark mode to ease strain when you're using the phone at night.I ran into one annoyance with the A20's Infinity-V display, which uses a V-shaped cutout to house the phone's front camera. Samsung's display all but eliminates bezels, and I often found that I was inadvertently brushing up against parts of the display when I tried using the phone with one hand. Perhaps that's something I'd get used to as I got more comfortable with a bezel-free phone, however. The back of the Galaxy A20 features a slightly protruding dual-camera module that holds a 13-megapixel lens with an f/1.9 aperture and a 5-megapixel wide-angle shooter with an f/2.2 aperture.With the second camera, the A20 can capture depth-of-field photographs, giving it a great edge over the identically priced Moto G7 Power and its single rear camera.I'm pleased with how the A20's cameras handled this windowsill scene within our New York office. The A20 balanced the natural light automatically for a good final product. Zooming in on the details of the plant's leaves, the texture blurred a bit, but that's expected. The A20's camera excels outdoors. An image taken in Bryant Park on a sunny morning offers vibrant contrast that really makes the little red flowers pop. The neutral colors don't sway to warm or cool, unlike in the G7 Power's attempt, which has a blue hue.If you're a fan of the portrait mode featured in many flagship phones, you'll enjoy the A20's Live Focus option, which Samsung has brought over from its pricier handsets. The camera automatically focuses on the subject — in this case, my co-worker Hunter — giving me control over how blurry the background appears. The edges of Hunter's clothes and hair aren't as defined as they might be on an iPhone, which costs $500 to $750 more than the Galaxy A20, but the result is still pretty neat.The A20's 8-MP selfie cam impressed me the most. The color output was bold and realistic, without oversaturating my face. Plus, the depth option blurred my boring office background. I prefer my A20 selfie to my G7 Power selfie, but you can take a look for yourself. The Exynos 7904 chipset that powers the Galaxy A20 is a mid- to budget-range system-on-a-chip from Samsung. The use of a less powerful chip helps keep the A20's cost lower than that of the Exynos 9610-powered A50, but you also make a trade-off with performance.The A20 scored a 4,174 in Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, compared to the A50's result of 5,200. The A20 also trailed the Moto G7 Power and its Snapdragon 632 processor, which scored 4,814 on Geekbench. Operating one app at a time is the only way to prevent lag on the A20. Once you try simultaneously firing up Instagram, Google Maps, WhatsApp or whichever lineup of apps you use daily, the A20 gets stressed. It'll hesitate between apps and slow down each individually.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe A20 is not made for gaming, though neither are most budget smartphones. Asphalt 9: Legends, for example, had a choppy frame rate and frustrating lag, and the back of the phone got hot.Demanding apps aren't the only things that perform sluggishly on the A20. The phone's rear fingerprint sensor is also oddly slow. Registering my print took several seconds, so I opted for the face-reader biometric or manual pattern more often than not. The Galaxy A20 redeems itself in how well the phone's 4,000-mAh battery holds up. In the Tom's Guide battery test, in which we have the phone surf the web continuously over T-Mobile's LTE network until the device runs out of juice, the A20 lasted an impressive 13 hours and 46 minutes. For comparison, the average smartphone dies just after 10 hours. The Nokia 7.1, which costs $100 more than the A20, ran out of power after just 7:42. The Moto G7 Power still holds the budget crown, with a 15:35 result, but that phone's larger, 5,000-mAh battery makes it bulkier than the A20. The Galaxy A20 supports 15-watt charging, which means you can top off the battery in a respectable amount of time. After 30 minutes of charging post-battery test, the A20 was about 30% charged; it took less than 2 hours to reach 100% power.As with most Samsung phones released in 2019, the Galaxy A20 ships with Android 9 Pie installed. Samsung tweaks that version of Android with the company's One UI interface, which means large app icons and text on the bottom of the screen. This works well for the A20's big display.The gesture-based navigation is ridiculously simple to figure out, and that's coming from the perspective of an iOS user. Plus, this kind of navigation keeps the screen clean of extra buttons. We expect the A20 to receive an Android Q update at some point next year, well after the software's launch. Samsung has never released Android upgrades with any urgency, and the midrange A20 will probably lag behind S- and Note-series devices in update priority.MORE: Best Samsung Phones: Which Galaxy Model Should You Buy?Though the the Galaxy A20 holds 32GB of storage, only 15GB to 20GB of it can be used for your photos and apps. That's because of the programs Metro preloads on the device. You can delete a few of them, but you'll have to disable others in settings if you want some more of that storage back.Any budget smartphone comes with trade-offs. And while there are some frustrations with  the Galaxy A20 — namely, a humble display and considerable performance lag — the phone's long battery life and better-than-average cameras impress. The ease with which it scratched was the biggest bother, but a case serves as an easy fix for that issue. Samsung doesn't sell the Galaxy A20 unlocked, so you'll have to buy it through a wireless carrier. Fortunately, you can find this device from several different wireless providers — AT&T looks like the glaring exception — so you'll likely be able to buy the phone from your preferred carrier. Should you, though? The Galaxy A20 fails to outshine a more polished budget phone like the Moto G7 Power, but it's a viable competitor. If you're looking to save on your next smartphone purchase and don't mind performance lags, the battery life and camera on the A20 make this Samsung a decent budget buy."

Gaming phones are specialized Android devices meant to offer the best gaming experience with big, high refresh rate displays, better cooling and huge batteries. I’ve made my opinions about gaming phones clear. They’re not as necessary as you might think — the best gaming phones are the ones that do everything else well, like the iPhone 12 Pro or OnePlus 9 Pro. And although the RedMagic 6 isn’t a bad device, it falls prey to the same old problems that have plagued rival gaming-centric devices.Read on for our review of the RedMagic 6, the value gaming phone.Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones. The RedMagic 6 won a highly recommended award.You can pick up a RedMagic 6 for $599/€599/£509 with 128GB of storage and 12GB of RAM, which is hundreds less than the ROG Phone 5. You’ll be able to pre-order from April 9 through 14 from Nubia. Sales open on April 15. If you’d like to double the storage and also get 16GB of RAM, you can grab the RedMagic 6 Pro, which costs $699/€699/£599.A gaming phone ought to pride itself on peak performance and the RedMagic 6 certainly delivers. It features a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 paired with 12GB of RAM, along with a built-in fan to keep everything cool when under stress. In Geekbench 5, the RedMagic 6 scored 1,120 in single-core and 3,681 in multicore. Compare that to the ROG Phone 5’s respective scores of 1,127 and 3,672. The phones are effectively neck and neck here, which is impressive when you consider the RedMagic 6 is €200 less than the starting price of the €799 ROG Phone 5. (Asus hasn’t set U.S. pricing for its gaming phone yet.)In 3DMark’s Wild Life benchmark, the RedMagic 6 managed 34.5 frames per second versus the ROG Phone 5’s 34.8 FPS. So the RedMagic 6 performs almost exactly the same as the more expensive ROG Phone 5 while packing in many of the same features.The huge 6.8-inch AMOLED display on the RedMagic 6 works great for games with minimal touch latency to give that extra edge in games that support it. With the RedMagic 6, you get two display calibrations, Vivid and Natural. In Vivid, the phone managed 171.5% of the sRGB and 121.5% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts with a Delta-E color accuracy score (where 0 is perfect) of 0.27. In the Natural mode, you’ll see 119.9% of the sRGB spectrum and 84.9% of the DCI-P3 gamut, all with a Delta-E score of 0.27. All of this comes close to the ROG Phone 5, where the RedMagic 6’s Vivid color profile is a bit richer than the ROG Phone 5’s. Regardless of which mode you go for, the RedMagic 6 scored lower Delta-E values than the ROG Phone 5.While it’s a pretty close contest, the ROG Phone 5 gets noticeably brighter for outdoor play at 748 nits versus the RedMagic 6’s 560 nits. This only really matters if you’re playing outside, though — 560 nits is plenty bright enough for indoor play.With its huge 5,050 mAh single-cell battery, the RedMagic 6 is a battery life champ. In its 60 Hz mode, it lasted for a whopping 13 hours and 20 minutes, placing it high up on our best phone battery life list. Up the refresh rate to the RedMagic’s 90 Hz default, the battery remains an impressive 11 hours and 30 minutes, still around 90 minutes better than the average smartphone. The RedMagic 6 also turned in impressive times when it’s screen was set to 120Hz (11:49) and 165Hz (11:16). The RedMagc 6 beat the ROG Phone 5 despite having a smaller battery. In its 60 Hz mode, the ROG Phone 5 lasted for 12 hours and 23 minutes, while holding out for 10:27 at 144 Hz. For charging the RedMagic 6 supports 66W charging. In our testing, the battery recharged to 34% in 15 minutes and 65% in 30 minutes. That’s not as fast as the OnePlus 9 Pro, but you can still top off your phone pretty quickly. We’ve spent this review focusing on the highlighting features of the RedMagic 6 that you’ll be looking for in a gaming phone. However, there are other items and features of note and we’ve outlined them below. Despite its status as a gaming phone, the RedMagic 6 is actually quite good, once you set aside its camera performance. It packs in a ton of hardware and software features for the low price of $599, which costs well below rival gaming phones. It’s neck and neck with the pricier ROG Phone 5.If you’re set on a gaming phone, then the RedMagic 6 is the best bang for your buck. It also has the added benefit of being available in the US while we’re still waiting on North America news for the ROG Phone 5."

With flagship phones selling for ten times as much as Motorola's latest budget offering, it’s refreshing to see such a capable phone at such a bargain price. As well as Motorola's trademark excellent battery life, the Moto g100 offers a quad-camera array of rear shooters, plus a large display, all bound up in a fun-though-plastic, chassis. Forget about special features, as you would for any phone that’s well below $200.This Moto g10 review shows how Motorola's phone can be a reliable choice if your budget is tight. But if you can spend a little more, you'll have the option of some substantially more impressive hardware — including additional Motorola handsets.Motorola has already launched the Moto g10 in the U.K., where it sells on sites like the Motorola store or John Lewis for an impressively low £129. For context, the Galaxy A20e, a more basic version of the Samsung Galaxy A20, costs £149, while the Moto g9 Power, the U.K.'s equivalent of the Moto G Power (2010), goes for £179. (That phone starts at $199 in the U.S.) So even among cheap phones, the Moto g10 is a bargain. There's only a single spec to choose from, too, which simplifies your buying decision.The Moto g10 could come to the U.S. eventually, but Motorola hasn’t hinted at when or what the price would be.You'll fall for the Moto g10's simple but fun design the moment you pick it up. The plastic material feels cheap in comparison to the classy metal and glass builds of fancier phones. But that’s understandable since we are talking about a cheap phone. The Moto g10 still has a pleasing weight to it despite the lighter materials, and the thicker-than-average sides add some sturdiness to the phone’s feel. It gives the impression that the g10 would keep on working even if you were to drop it on accident. (We do not advise testing this theory out.) The wavy molding on the back of the phone looks kind of neat, and despite what you might think, it doesn't feel strange to hold since the edges of the phone are still smooth.The Aurora Gray color option of my review unit has hidden depths, with the gray turning to a shiny purple in the right light. The alternative color, Sakura Pearl, looks to do the same except with a white body.Motorola has tested the Moto g10 to the IP52 specification. That means the g10 will shrug off a rain shower, but it won't be safe against heavier spray or immersion in water.At 6.5 inches, the Moto g10's display is a fair size that’s spoiled somewhat by thick bezels on all four of its sides. At least the waterdrop notch at the top holds the camera without sacrificing more screen space to a full bezel.The HD+ LCD panel is far from the best I've tried on a phone. It isn't particularly bright at the best of times, and extreme angles make things even harder to see on the screen.Watching Billie Eilish's rendition of ""Everything I Wanted"" at The Grammys 2021 looked all right, with the colors of Eilish's trademark neon-green hair popping from the screen nicely. However I did notice how dim the display was in comparison to other phones such as the similarly price Realme 7, which also uses an LCD panel. Naturally, there was also an obvious lack of detail in her glittery outfit and jewelry from the moto g10's HD display.A single bottom-ported speaker on the Moto g10 offers a decent volume, reproducing Eilish's distinctive vocals loud and clear. Exploring it further with Post Malone and Swae Lee's Sunflower playing, I appreciated how nicely the chilled-out vocals came across. That came at the expense of the rest of the mix, though, with the beat and instruments feeling disappointingly muted. If that's a problem for you, then you can use the headphone jack or Bluetooth to pipe the sound through your own headphones or earbuds, which are likely much better than the Moto g10’s speaker.Even though the Moto g10 is a budget phone, you still have four sensors on the back of the phone. A 48MP main camera and a 8MP ultrawide angle lens lead the way, but you also get a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro camera. An 8MP selfie cam on the front of the phone rounds out the optics.To show off the photo ability of the Moto g10, I compared it to pictures taken by the Realme 7, a phone that’s only available in the U.K. that’s pretty identical to Motorola’s handset. That should help us see how well Motorola has tuned its hardware for the best shots possible.Testing the main cameras with a shot of a path through a park, I find it's hard to pick between images from the two phones. The Realme 7's shot is quite a lot brighter, but that comes at the expense of color. This is why on balance the Moto g10 is my preferred image.That flips around when we try out a night mode shot. In this post-sunset image of Navigator Square at Archway, there's a lot more noise in the night sky on the g10's image, and it's a less vivid shade of blue than the one the Realme has produced. The Motorola also struggled to contain the light coming from the streetlamps, something the Realme also managed better. It seems like Motorola could improve its photo software here.I'm torn on which image's color I prefer in this ultrawide shot of Tufnell Park Playing Fields and its surrounding apartment blocks. However, Realme's image is far noisier than Motorola's, making the Moto g10 the easy winner of this comparison.Depth sensors are added to phones to assist with adding special effects to the primary cameras, so I turned on portrait mode when shooting this hedge sculpture to test out the ones on the Motorola and Realme. The Realme 7 required more effort to produce a shot I liked, since its depth camera offered either very dark and very bright images of this scene. The Moto g10's images were less extreme, but as a result meant I got decent color accuracy for the leafy feline while retaining background detail.While not directly related to the quality of the image, I appreciated how the g10 offered a slider to control the intensity of the blur in portrait shots. I found the maximum setting to look the best, but being able to tailor the effect to your liking is a thoughtful inclusion.Macro cameras on phones are notoriously finicky, so I gave these two handsets the best chance possible by using a bright light to illuminate this pile of coffee beans on my kitchen table. The Moto g10 has produced an image that more accurately captures the color of these light-roasted beans. While the Realme 7 offers similar details, the color of its shot couldn’t match the Moto g10.When testing the front camera, the Moto g10 scores a final easy win in this selfie comparison. It gives a prettier background blur compared to the Realme, and much better colors too. I look much more natural in Motorola's image, instead of strangely pink as I do in Realme's shot.When it comes to processor power, the Moto g10 provides the bare minimum. The Snapdragon 460 chipset and 4GB RAM are significantly less powerful than almost any other phone you can get today — the Moto G Power 2021 runs on a Snapdragon 662 for context — and that shows in the benchmarks.The Moto g10 managed a 247 single-core score and a 1,130 multi-core score on the Geekbench 5 benchmark. That's far lower than the Moto G Power's already low 314 and 1,437. Only the equally cheap and far worse, Hot Pepper Ghost achieved lower scores of 158 and 834. For further comparison, our favorite cheap phone, the Pixel 4a, scored 551 and 1647, though that device costs a couple hundred dollars more than Motorola’s cheap handset.It's a similar story with the 3DMark Wild Life graphics test. The Moto's result was 250 points, 1.5 frames per second, which doesn't even match up to the 372 points and 2.2 frames per second the Moto G Power got. I attempted to play the first-person shooter Tau Ceti on the g10, and it did not go well. The game's 3D graphics appeared in their lowest quality, and even then, the Motorola phone couldn't show them at a fast-enough frame rate for me to actually play. This won't be a phone you'll want to be playing or working on beyond the very basics.With a 5,000 mAh battery inside, the Moto g10 has a larger battery than many current flagships. And that's great news for its battery life. Motorola g-series phones have historically performed excellently when it comes to longevity, and the g10 is no exception. My attempt to run down the g10's battery overnight ended up in the phone playing almost 24 hours of YouTube video over Wi-Fi on the g10 non-stop before it shut itself down. Once you've powered this phone up, it's not going to empty for a while, no matter what you're doing.Filling up the Moto g10’s massive battery takes longer. The included 10W charger gets the battery to 25% full in 30 minutes, and fills up to 100% in a glacial 2 hour and 27 minutes; that’s a similar recharge time to the current Moto G Power. It's just as well the battery is as large as it is, since you won't be able to easily top-up the g10 in a few minutes of charging.As with the last few generations of its phones, the Moto g10 runs on MyUX, which is a slightly altered version of the stock Android you'd find on a more expensive Google Pixel device. It means aside from the Moto app, you get only the basic collection of Google apps when setting up the phone, letting you tailor your home screens as you see fit.Unfortunately, Motorola is not offering OS upgrades on the g10. It'll still get security upgrades and updates to Moto-specific apps, but you won't get any upgrade past Android 11.The Moto app caught my attention however because of how thoroughly it explains the g10's features. The combination of easy-to-understand text, fun cartoon illustrations and the ability to try out features before returning to the app and turning them on made this perhaps the most comprehensive guide to Android I've come across. It's not something experienced users need, but if this is a first smartphone for your young kid or an elderly relative, the tips in the Moto app will make sure they quickly learn the ropes.One other Moto-specific feature I found handy was the ""Peek Display."" You access this from the lockscreen by tapping one of the notification icons, which then shows a substantial chunk of the message you've been sent. If you're the kind of person who often opens up their phone to read a single email but then ends up scrolling through other apps (like me), this lets you check your notifications without needing to unlock the phone.Before even finishing the set-up process, I grew to detest the haptic feedback the g10 gave. Rather than the crisp, popping feel of hitting keys on a Pixel 4a, you instead get a vague mushy buzz every time you type. You can turn this off, but then you're left with no feedback at all, which I think is almost worse than having bad feedback.If you're a fan of Google Assistant, the g10 sports a dedicated button to summon the assistant for you to then command. If you don't use it, then that means there's a small portion of the right edge you should avoid pressing. You don't have the option to remap it either, only disable it.The final criticism I have of the user experience is how slow it can be to move through the menus. This is understandable given the low-powered chipset/RAM combination, but it borders on frustrating sometimes.For a device that covers the basics, the Motorola Moto g10 ticks all the boxes. You have a smartly designed and easy-to-use Android skin, a battery that will last almost an entire day of constant use, plus some acceptable camera abilities, and all for a relative pittance.You can't expect the world for this price, but some flaws in the Moto g10 experience shouldn't be ignored. The low-resolution display is dim and hard to see from all but a dead-on angle, plus the low-powered chipset means you will struggle to play the latest games or use demanding apps. As a phone for first-time smartphone buyers, this is a brilliant device. It's eminently practical in a way that few other phones are these days, and is keen to help users learn how to make use of all of what the phone provides. If what you need is a smartphone and nothing else, the Moto g10 is the perfect utilitarian device. But if you want advanced features, you won't need to spend much more to get a well-priced but effective phone like the Pixel 4a."
61,Xiaomi Mi 11,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-11,"Starting price: £749 Display: 6.81-inch QHD AMOLED (3200 x 1440) Refresh rate: 30 - 120Hz Rear cameras: 108MP main (f1.8), 13MP ultrawide (f2.4), 5MP telemacro (f2.4) Front camera: 20MP (f2.2) Chipset: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB/256GB microSD: Not available Operating system: Android 11 with MUI 12 Battery: 4,600 mAh Charging: 55W wired, 50W wireless, 10W reverse wireless Colors: Midnight Gray (pictured), White, Horizon Blue Size: 6.5 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches (164.3 x 74.6 x 8.1mm) Weight: 6.9 ounces (196g) IP rating: n/aAs good as the Xiaomi Mi 11 is, — and after testing this phone I can confirm that it’s very good — it still isn't a great phone for everyone.Throughout this Xiaomi Mi 11 review, you'll see that this phone isn’t lacking when it comes to hardware. Its display and performance specs together make this a great phone for gaming, streaming or using CPU-intensive apps. Its user experience is also enjoyable, the software adding smart enhancements to the basic Android experience and its battery offering an effective mix of long life and speedy charging. Plus it's a pretty handsome piece of glass and circuitry to boot.But while U.K. shoppers can find the Xiaomi Mi 11, U.S users won’t be able to. And when it comes to cameras, the Mi 11 starts to stumble.Fortunately, with a price lower than the Samsung Galaxy S21 and the offer of superior specs in several areas, the Mi 11 will delight anyone who fancies picking one up with just how much it packs into the phone.Xiaomi brought the Mi 11 to the U.K. on March 16, where it retails for either £749 for the 128GB storage version, or £799 for 256GB.As a comparison, a Galaxy S21 with 128GB storage sells for £769, while a 128GB iPhone 12 goes for £849. It's not as big a price difference as we were hoping before the announcement, but the Mi 11, particularly the 256GB version, is quite the bargain compared to its rivals.There's no U.S. availability for Xiaomi, with the company currently in dispute with the U.S. government. (Not that Xiaomi phones were readily available in the U.S. before that.) You'll probably be able to find it available for import if you've got your mind set on a Mi 11, but given the additional cost and potential trouble with 4G/5G band compatibility, you're probably better off buying a phone that's already sold in your country. Our guide to the best Android phones is a good place to start if you need alternative ideas.From the front, the Xiaomi Mi 11 resembles many other Android flagships, but it's still a looker. It's set apart by its quad-curve display, which gives the phone a stylish profile that catches the light attractively.I can't make up my mind on the look of the Mi 11’s back though. The camera bump in the top-left corner throws me off, since its three-part structure looks muddled, even if the rounded square shape and silver ring around the main lens look the business from a distance.It doesn't help that the rest of the back is plain aside from logos and regulatory text toward the bottom, which only makes it easier for your eye to settle on the cameras.The Xiaomi Mi 11 screen's made of Gorilla Glass Victus, the same glass found on the Galaxy S21, so you shouldn't have to worry too much about small scratches appearing by accident. You'll need to be more careful about exposing the Mi 11 to water and dust though; while Xiaomi says the phone is water-resistant, it doesn't have an official IP rating.U.K. shoppers have a choice of three basic colors: a plain white, Midnight Gray and Horizon Blue. The gray of my review unit looks classy with its satin-style finish (aside from all the fingerprints it picks up), although I like how the blue and white add a little more visual interest to the phone.With a 6.8 inch-AMOLED panel, the Xiaomi Mi 11 is on the larger side of this year's Android flagship phones. However a QHD resolution, 1,500-nit maximum brightness and a variable 120Hz refresh rate mean this isn't just another big screen phone.Those impressive features don't cause battery life to suffer excessively, either. The Mi 11 offers both a variable resolution and variable refresh rate, so under certain conditions, the phone will scale down to FHD, while opting for a 90Hz, 60Hz or 30Hz refresh speed to save you power. The approach isn't as versatile as the LTPO display on the identically-sized Galaxy S21 Ultra, which can vary anywhere between 10Hz and 120Hz. But Xiaomi’s approach with the Mi 10 is still effective.I loved watching video on the Mi 11. Poring over the trailer for the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, the bright colors, be it the green of the four testudine protagonists or the purple of their enemies' jumpsuits, were positively glowing. Ironically, the high-resolution display let me really appreciate the grainy, retro animation style that the game's cinematic uses to call back to the original cartoon.Technically the Mi 11 display curves around the side of the phone on all four edges, but this is only noticeable on the left and right, and even then the curved portion is mostly bezel. The top and bottom curves are very subtle, with a particularly obvious bottom bezel. However the phone does feel nice to hold horizontally as a result.Xiaomi's added a ""hardware-level mistouch sensor"" to avoid you accidentally swiping the screen just by holding the curved edges. I didn't notice the phone being particularly sensitive to accidental touches, so this system seems to do its job. If you want, you can alter the settings so the dead zone around the edges is larger or smaller if the automated system isn't to your liking.Evidently quite proud of its Harman/Kardon- tuned stereo speakers, Xiaomi emblazons the speaker company's name on the top edge of the Mi 11. Listening to British rap artist Dave's ""Location"", I was impressed with the phone's depiction of his vocals and the mid-range instrumentation behind him. But as is often the case with phone speakers, the bass frequencies were lacking power.Still, listening to the same song on an iPhone 12 Pro, it became clear that percussion is a lot more prominent on the Mi 11, which if anything made the listening experience a bit worse. However, I also noticed an impressive sense of width from the Xiaomi's speakers too. Whether or not the speakers deserve the Harman/Kardon badge for quality, they deserve them for the mini soundstage effect they conjure. Although not the most powerful or diverse camera array available, the Xiaomi Mi 11 covers the basics. The back three cameras consist of a 108MP main camera, a 13MP ultrawide camera and a 5MP macro camera, plus a flash. On the front, you have a single 20MP selfie cam.While you can set the main camera to take 108MP photos via the Pro mode in the Mi 11’s camera app, the phone takes 27MP photos by default. The Mi 11 manages this by combining sensor data from four pixels into one virtual pixel, a process called pixel binning. This saves you space in your phone's storage, plus it's ideal for low-light shots, at least in theory.That doesn't seem to have helped the Mi 11 capture this view over an inner London park. It's much darker than the iPhone 12 Pro's image I'm using for comparison, which makes it hard to notice any additional detail the 27MP shot gets over the 12MP iPhone photo.Switching to 108MP mode on the Xiaomi Mi 11 goes some way to addressing this problem. The straight lines and bright colors of the playground apparatus stand out much more, and makes it a far better rival for the iPhone shot. That's fine, except 108MP images can take up to nine times as much storage space as 12MP shots. That will fill up any phone's onboard storage pretty quick.The ultrawide camera on the Mi 11 has a magnification of 0.6x — common for Android phones but less extreme than the 0.5x camera on the iPhone 12 Pro, hence the different look of these two images of Archway. Either way, this round belongs to the iPhone thanks to its much richer colors.The only thing missing from a typical flagship camera set-up on the Mi 11 is a telephoto sensor, but these tend to appear on more expensive models of flagships, such as the expected Xiaomi Mi 11 Pro. What you get instead with the Mi 11 is a ""telemacro"" camera. A lot of cheaper Android phones include macro cameras, but the Mi 11's version offers variable magnification to better achieve good close-up shots.The result is the best macro shot I've taken with a dedicated macro lens on a smartphone. I tried taking the same shot of this daffodil with the main camera too, and while I was able to get a better focus on the stigma in the center, I couldn't focus on the petals at the same time, and the colors are far less vivid. It's convincing enough proof of the camera's inclusion is worth your time, rather than it being a cynical attempt by the phone maker to bump up the lens count. It's still very hard to take these macro photos without any stabilization. The one you see here was from a selection of 17 attempts. Normally, it takes me five at most to find a shot I'm happy with.I have to hand it to Xiaomi when it comes to the selfie cam. Normally I enjoy the more vivid colors you see in an iPhone 12 Pro selfie, but here I just look sunburnt. The Xiaomi has supplied a much more natural-looking selfie, plus does a slightly better job of cutting my head out from the trees in the background. The tradeoff is a much smoother image, which looks more artificial despite the colors better reflecting those I saw in the viewfinder.Under the hood, the Xiaomi Mi 11 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. While you get the latest chipset Qualcomm has to offer, you only have 8GB RAM, which pales in comparison to the 12GB you can now find on top performing Androids like the Galaxy S21 Ultra or Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.It's still enough for the Xiaomi to really impress. On the Geekbench 5 general benchmark, the Mi 11 scored 1,112 on the single core section and 3,379 on the multi-core section. The basic Galaxy S21 only manages 1,048 and 3,302 respectively.The Galaxy S21 Plus, which uses the same chip and RAM capacity, beat the Mi 11's single core score with 1,116, but the Mi 11 edged out the S21 Plus’ multicore score of 3,300. The S21 Ultra easily beats the Mi 11 on both tests, but has an easy advantage thanks to 12GB of RAM.In 3D Mark's Wild Life graphics test, the Mi 11 achieved a score of 5,676, which averages to 34 frames per second. That tops the Galaxy S21's 5,504 point/33 FPS result while finishing in line with the Galaxy S21 Plus (5,650/34 FPS). Trying out Marvel Contest of Champions proved that these scores are reflected by real-world performance. Watching Spider-Man beat up rival superheroes looked great and displayed smoothly on the Xiaomi Mi 11. The Mi 11's 480Hz touch sampling rate allows the display to react faster to taps than the average phone's.There's also a vapor cooling chamber built into the Mi 11, which is likely why I didn't notice the phone heat up even after trying out all the games I downloaded, or during the benchmark tests. Even charging up the phone didn't noticeably increase the temperature of the casing.The badge on the back of the Mi 11 tells you it's a 5G-ready phone. However making sure you'll actually be able to use it on a faster network is a little more complicated.5G networks work on one or more signal bands, which some phones can pick up and others can't. This is why if you're determined to bring a Mi 11 over to the U.S., it's crucial you check which bands your mobile carrier offers and which the Mi 11 will work with. U.K. customers shouldn't have to worry though. There's much greater unity between the 5G carriers over here, and all of them should offer 5G support with the Mi 11 according to Xiaomi's specs.The 4,500 mAh battery in the Xiaomi Mi 11 is smaller than average for a phone of this size. The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 6.8-inch screen like the Mi 11, but gets a 5,000 mAh cell.Nonetheless, the Mi 11's battery does a good job at keeping the phone powered up. After watching an hour of YouTube in full screen mode (the main battery-intensive activity I use my phones for), the Mi 11 lost 8% of its total charge. That equates to a full day of binge-watching the remakes of Hamilton songs in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which means the Mi 11 will probably handle a day of actual work capably without needing an emergency trip to a charging plug.The Mi 11 also gets points by not only including a charger in the box, but by offering you a 55W block to match the phone's maximum charging speed.There are a few faster charging standards out there, for example, the 65W one used by the OnePlus 8T. But filling your phone to 45% in 15 minutes, 80% in 30 and 100% in 48 minutes as you can with the Xiaomi Mi 11 is still respectably fast. It certainly beats the 25W charging offered by the Galaxy S21, which doesn't come with an included charger in the box.The 50W wireless charging on the Mi 11 means you should achieve almost identical speeds to those above without cables. However you'll need one of Xiaomi's own charging pads to hit that speed and since we don't have one we couldn't check the speed for ourselves.Finally, the Mi 11 offers reverse wireless charging up to 10W to give a friend's phone a boost of power or to keep your wearables and wireless earbuds topped up. The typical Android 11 features come wrapped in Xiaomi's MIUI 12 on the Mi 11. It balances the super clean look of stock Android seen on phones like the Google Pixel 5 with the more modified feature set of something like the Galaxy S21's One UI, which is an overall positive.Among the unique enhancements in MIUI 12 are floating windows, which let you open a fully functional resizable window of one app over another, either from a notification or via the recent apps screen. All modern Android phones can open two apps in split screen, but this gives you more freedom to look at the areas of the apps that you want, quickly taking notes from a browser window or even copy and pasting between them just as one example.Other handy but less notable features include an always-on display, an optional app drawer, and security offerings like blurring app previews and removing location data from shared photos. MIUI also offers an iOS-style option to divide the notification shade and quick settings menu into two, accessed separately by swiping down from either the left or right side of the top edge of the screen.The phone ships with a fair number of bundled-in Xiaomi and third-party apps. But the Mi 11 is thoughtful enough to pack these away into a handful of folders for a less messy home screen, assuming you don't want to just delete them all.Our Xiaomi Mi 11 review finds an impressive phone, with very few omissions. It would have been nice to have a telephoto camera on the back instead of the telemacro lens, and a bigger battery would have been welcome, too. But even without those features, this phone still comes with premium capabilities comparable to more expensive phones.We have little hesitation in recommending this to an Android fan looking for an alternative to Samsung, particularly if you prioritize streaming videos or playing games over capturing photos. However photography addicts, and especially U.S. shoppers, should look elsewhere for the time being."
62,Oppo Find X3 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oppo-find-x3-pro,"Price: £1,099 Screen size: 6.7-inch OLED (3216 x 1440, 5 to 120Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 888 RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB Rear cameras: 50MP main (f/1.8); 50MP ultra wide (f/2.2); 13MP telephoto (f/2.4); 3MP microlens (f/3.0) Front camera: 32MP (f/3.0) Battery size: 4,500 mAh Size: 6.4 x 2.9 x 0.33 inches (163.6 x 74.0 x 8.26mm) Weight: 6.81 ounces (193g)In There will be Blood, protagonist Daniel Plainview declared “I drink your milkshake!” in reference to effectively stealing the oil from another person’s land. Well, that’s what I feel the Oppo Find X3 Pro is aiming to do to Samsung flagship phones. With the Oppo Find X2 Pro, Chinese smartphone maker Oppo made a stellar debut into the U.K.’s flagship Android arena. And now the Find X3 Pro looks set to build upon those foundations and take on the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, among other best Android phones. With access to the Snapdragon 888, improved cameras, and a striking design, the Oppo Find X3 Pro is a proper high-end phone that makes few compromises to take on the best Apple and Samsung have to offer. So come we me for this Oppo Find X3 Pro review, as I tell you the tale of why you should consider this phone if you're looking for a premium device.Editor's note: We crowned our picks in the Tom's Guide Awards 2021 for phones. The Find X3 Pro won a highly recommended award.When it goes on sale in the U.K. on April 14, the Oppo Find X3 Pro will set you back £1,099. That’s far from cheap and puts the X3 Pro in the same price range as the iPhone 12 Pro Max ($1,099 in the U.S and £1,099 in the UK). But Apple will only give you 128GB of storage space for the money, while Oppo offers the Find X3 Pro with 256GB. There's no 512GB option for the Find X3 Pro, and that seems like a stage step down from the Find X2 Pro. While that phone also cost the same amount at launch, it had double the storage. However, the X3 Pro undercuts the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which starts at a hefty £1,149 for the 128GB model in the UK. (It's $1,199 for U.S. shoppers.) I won't call the X3 Pro a bargain, but it’s definitely competitively priced for this kind of flagship phone, given it has a suite of specs to trade blows with some of the best phones around. As Oppo shares a manufacturing line with OnePlus, there’s an argument that the biggest rival the Find X3 Pro could face will come from its sibling brand. The OnePlus 9 is set to make its debut on March 23. And given the OnePlus 8 Pro undercut the Find X2 Pro, at a starting price of £799, yet provided an impressive specs sheet, the rumored OnePlus 9 Pro could do the same; time will tell on this. Unfortunately, for people on the wrong side of the Atlantic ocean, the Find X3 Pro isn't coming to the U.S, at least not at launch. Oppo could change its mind if the X3 Pro garners attention on Britain's shores. I adore the vegan leather back on the Find X2 Pro, as its textured finish made the large phone and its curved display feel less likely to slip out of my hands and dash itself upon the floor. Sadly, the Find X3 Pro has no such coating. Rather Oppo has gone for a unibody design, with a shiny Gloss Black and Gloss Blue color options. This means the phone feels slippier to use and sucks up fingerprints like an overly eager CSI intern. But this is compensated for with dimensions of 163.6 x 74.0 x 8.26mm and a weight of 193g, making X3 Pro is slimmer and lighter than its predecessor. The sides of the X3 Pro's display are less curved as well, meaning the phone is overall easier to hold despite its 6.7-inch display.The choice for this glass unibody becomes apparent when you flip the phone over. Rather than sit alone in its own housing, the camera module is covered by the unibody chassis. This has the effect of seamlessly integrating the camera array into the phone’s back and minimizing the amount of edges and groves that could trap dust and debris.In promotional photos, the design looks intriguing but a little clumsy. But I’m happy to report that in the flesh — or Gorilla Glass 6 — the Find X3 Pro’s camera module is very attractive. It won't lie flat, as the camera module (which looks rather similar to the iPhone 12 Pro’s rear array) is still very much a bump. But it's a rather neat bit of industrial design that’s up there with the contrasting Contour Cut camera module on the Samsung Galaxy S21.The shiny finish is super reflective and difficult to capture neatly on camera, but I think the Find X3 Pro looks rather impressive. And it’s nice to see Oppo continue to push phone design rather than rest on its laurels after the Find X2 Pro.While the contrasting green stripe on the power button is a neat touch, the X3 Pro doesn't have as many grooves as the X2 Pro, nor does it have the shaper oblong-shaped SIM card slot, which felt like extravagant design for no reason. I slightly miss the almost over-the-top design of the X2 Pro, but there’s no doubt the X3 Pro unibody approach is more refined.Aside from that, it's business as usual, with a USB-C port for charging and accessories, Dolby Atmos-calibrated stereo speakers that deliver some rather impressive audio for phone speakers, and IP68 water and dust resistance. One advantage of this unibody approach is that the glass construction of the Find X3 Pro can support wireless charging, something that was disappointingly absent in the X2 Pro.Evolution is the name of the game here, as the Oppo Find X3 Pro’s display is rather similar to X2 Pro’s screen. Sporting a 6.7-inch, 10-bit color panel with a QHD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, the Oppo Find X3 Pro doesn't seem to offer anything new, at least at first glance.The new phone's a little sharper with a 525 pixel-per-inch density over the X2 Pro’s 513 ppi, and peak brightness hits 1,300 nits against 1,200. However, dig a little deeper and things get interesting. The biggest change is the dynamic refresh rate thanks to an LTPO panel, meaning the display can drop from 120Hz to 5Hz when a high refresh rate isn’t needed and thus save on battery. That beats the LTPO panel in the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which can only drop down to 10Hz.The second upgrade is support for true 10-bit color depth, meaning the X3 Pro’s display can showcase a billion colors. While the Find X2 Pro comes advertised with a 10-bit panel, it’s not actually a native 10-bit display. Rather it uses an 8-bit panel that mimics a 10-bit output. But with a “Full-path Color Management System,'' the Find X3 Pro can snap 10-bit photos and then display them natively. You can’t do this on the Find X2 Pro.In practice, the X3 Pro’s display is very similar to the X2 Pro’s, which is no bad thing as colors are rich, contrast is great, and there’s HDR10+ support. Viewing a 10-bit photo on the X3 Pro against a normal photo captured on the phone’s rear camera system, there was very little difference between them. The 10-bit photo had maybe a tiny bit more color to my eyes, but the difference was barely there.In its default “Vivid” mode, the X3 Pro’s display covers 172.6% of the sRGB and 122.3% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts. And it kicked out a Delta-E of 0.33. Those are impressive figures, and the Find X3 Pro trounces the likes of both the Galaxy S21 Ultra (81.4%) and iPhone 12 Pro Max (84.8%) in terms of color coverage. Apple’s handset wins on color accuracy though, with a Delta-E of 0.07. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)In real-world use, though, the X3 Pro’s display is a joy to use. It’s fantastic for videos — especially when put into the phone's DCI-P3 “Cinematic” mode — as well as games and pretty much everything else. I’d argue the X3 Pro has one of the best displays on any smartphone, certainly up there with the finest from Samsung. Just don't expect it to be a huge step up from the X2 Pro.Sitting in the unibody-integrated rear module is the Oppo Find X3 Pro’s quartet of cameras, comprising a 50MP main lens with a Sony IMX766 sensor, a 50MP ultra-wide camera with the same Sony sensor, a 13MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 3MP microlens.Starting with the main lens, it comes with optical image stabilization and a f/1.8 aperture, slightly narrower than the Find X2’s f/1.7 aperture, but that camera only has a 48MP lens. As such, the Find X3 Pro tends to capture slightly crisper photos, not that the X2 Pro’s main shots were lacking in detail. The X3 Pro also tends to deliver slightly cooler yet more color-saturated photos, while the X2 Pro is warmer but errs more toward a less vivid palette.Thankfully, the X3 Pro doesn’t oversaturate in the way the Galaxy S21 can, though it can’t quite deliver the true-to-life colors of the iPhone 12 or Pixel 5. Take the image below as an example shot by both the Oppo Find X3 Pro and a Google Pixel 5. While both phones handle this relatively busy scene well, the Pixel 5 offers colors that are closer to what I was seeing, as well as greater dynamic range that helps pick out details in the shadows.However, in some shots, the Find X3 Pro comes out on top. Take the photo of some gorse below. The iPhone 12 shot serves up a better yellow hue on the flowers, but blows out the sky in the background. The X3 Pro might not get the colors spot on, but delivers a better photo overall.And the Find X3 Pro could trade blows with some of the best camera phones all day long. The Oppo phone produces a brighter and more vibrant image, but the Pixel 5 offers a greater dynamic range and a more textured photo in my opinion. When the sun goes down it’s time for the Find X3 Pro’s night mode. It serves up a cleaner and more color-accurate night mode shot than the X2 Pro, though some might prefer the latter’s warmer color tones. But in comparison to the Pixel 5’s Night Sight mode, the X3 Pro lags behind; I’d put it on par with the Galaxy S21. That’s far from bad but not quite up there with Google and Apple’s low-light image processing, which continues to set the standard when the lights go down.While we are on the subject of image processing, portrait mode on the rear camera is one area where some smartphones can stumble. Thankfully the Find X3 Pro doesn’t. On still objects, the Oppo Find X3 Pro does an excellent job artfully blurring backgrounds while keeping the subject and foreground nice and clear, a little more so than its predecessor. And it delivers a more pleasing portrait pic than the Pixel 5, which can be a bit overzealous with its tight background blurring. The portrait shot of my friend Tris below is rather impressive, with the X3 Pro not running into problems with over-smoothing his skin or shifting the color tone. However, it struggled at picking out the left-hand edge of his glasses against the water. The Pixel 5 ran into this problem too. But the iPhone 12 didn’t and continues to set a very high standard for portrait shots. Switch off X3 Pro’s portrait mode, and standard rear camera shots of people remain at flagship quality.Oppo has paid particular attention to ultra-wide angle shots with the Find X3 Pro — that's why it put the 50MP Sony IMX766 sensor into what’s a 110-degree secondary camera. Oppo said this came down to people’s appetite for wider shots and to ensure color consistency across the cameras. Turns out this was a good move.There’s no significant color shift between the wide angle and ultra wide cameras, unlike the perceivable change in tone when swapping between Find X2 Pro’s cameras. Furthermore, the X3 Pro delivers crisper ultra-wide shots compared to the X2 Pro, though you’ll need to zoom in to really spot the difference.While I like the wide-angle shots the Pixel 5 captures, the X3 Pro fits more into the frame and also picks out more details. Compared against the Galaxy S21, which sports a 120-degree field of view, the X3 Pro just barely offers a sharper image in the photos below — look carefully at the building in the background and bricks in the wall.One area where Oppo has seemingly downgraded from the X2 Pro is with the Find X3 Pro's telephoto camera. Both Oppo flagships have 13MP cameras. But the X2 Pro offers a 5x optical zoom and a max 60x digital zoom, whereas the newer phone comes with a 5x hybrid zoom and a maximum of 20x digital zoom.But there’s some nuance here. The X3 Pro’s lens offers a 2x optical zoom, whereas the X2 Pro is digital until it hits 5x. As a result, photos at 2x zoom are clearer on the X3 Pro, whereas the X2 Pro has the edge at 5x.If you look closely at the photo of the reeds snapped at 5x zoom, you can see the Find X2 Pro’s shot is the clearest, thanks to the extra optical range. But the X3 Pro’s image is brighter, and that’s thanks to it having a wider f/2.4 aperture compared to the f/3.0 of its predecessor’s telephoto camera. As such, the X3 Pro’s zoomed shots let in more light and deliver better colors.Push into 10x hybrid zoom and the story is the same. The X2 Pro delivers clearer images once you really look carefully, but the X3 Pro offers more brightness and color, as well as being easier to get a zoom shot as the sensor seems to detect less wobble from my hands. Much beyond this is a bit pointless, with 20x being a bit of a mess and the 60x zoom of the Find X2 Pro also being more of a marketing snippet than a useable camera feature. If you want extreme zooms, then you need to look towards the Galaxy S21 series.Flip the Oppo Find X3 Pro over and you’ve got the same 32MP punch-hole selfie camera in the left-hand corner of the display that its predecessor featured. Fortunately, the Find X3 Pro appears to have slightly boosted how its software compiles selfie photos.Portrait mode on the X3 Pro renders better skin tones than the X2 Pro. But compared to the iPhone 12, I feel the Apple’s phone has the edge. In the shot of my styled-by-lockdown visage, the iPhone 12 captures a wider range of color tones helped by the light illuminating my desperate need for a shave. While I’m impressed with the Find X3 Pro’s restraint on image processing, I feel the iPhone 12’s handling of color and light delivers a shot that has more dynamic depth.The final part of the camera setup comes in the form of the Find X3 Pro's 3MP fixed-focus microscope lens. This has been designed to go beyond macro cameras and really capture the microscopic details in a photo. When placed against fabric you can capture a shot of the weaved threads. And it can be used to see what goes on in the grooves of a tree stump.It’s more interesting to use than a macro lens or the weird monochrome camera on the likes of the OnePlus 8T. But it’s tricky to get a good shot with the X3 Pro's microscope lens. You need a very steady hand to get a photo that’s roughly in focus. Ideally you need to let in some light so you have to hold one or two millimeters above what you’re trying to shoot, which is comically hard unless you have an uncanny ability to be still; I do not.At best the microscope lens is a fun thing to use. At worst it's another gimmick that Oppo could have dropped to shave down the X3 Pro’s price appeal. I don’t begrudge its inclusion in the camera setup, but I’d rather have a secondary telephoto lens like the Galaxy S21 Ultra has.Despite this weird fourth lens, the Find X3 Pro puts in a truly impressive smartphone photography performance. It can stand up against some of the best phone cameras around. And while I feel the iPhone 12 range and Pixel 5 might have it beaten in some shots, there's no doubt Oppo has a high-end camera array in the X3 Pro.Video is comprehensive on the Oppo Find X3 Pro working across the main, ultra-wide and telephoto cameras, with up to 5x hybrid zoom supported. You'll find 4K at 60 fps on offer as well as a rather effective super steady mode that’s capped at 1080p and 60 fps. That's all fairly standard stuff, but there are some neat extras. The first is a bokeh video effect that’s basically a portrait mode for video. It works rather well, though it's something we’ve seen on the Galaxy S21.A “Cinematic” video mode gives you 4K video with HDR and more manual control. It’s a neat feature that’s nice to have and should take advantage of the X3 Pro’s 10-bit capture. But you’ll need to get familiar with it to take advantage of the features. Another neat touch on the X3 Pro is the AI Highlight Video option that can smartly detect the type of scene you’re shooting and configure the capture accordingly, such as switching on the night mode or applying HDR. All these features are interesting, but in standard point-and-shoot video, the X3 Pro can't quite hit the high points of the iPhone 12. Apple’s phone delivers a smoother and easier-to-use video experience, while the X3 Pro can struggle with progressive focus when panning a camera and transitioning from one scene to another. Meanwhile, the wide range of video options in the Galaxy S21 range, including shooting 8K video and 120 fps capture, leaves the Find X3 behind. Still, Oppo's phone puts in a very capable video performance, though it just doesn't impress me as much as it does on the still photography side.Unsurprisingly, the Oppo FInd X3 Pro comes with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset. And equally unsurprising is the super-fast performance the chipset delivers. The chip is matched with 12GB of RAM meaning it’ll chew through pretty much anything you can throw at it. The X3 Pro handled games like Call of Duty Mobile at max settings and a smooth frame rate to help tap into the 120Hz refresh rate. There was nothing I found that brought the phone to its knees. Granted, an Galaxy S21 Ultra can be specced with 16GB of RAM, but I feel that’s overkill. In terms of benchmarks, the Find X3 Pro delivered a single-core score of 934 and a multi-core score of 3,337 in Geekbench 5. That’s a strong result, though not really a big step up from the Find X2 Pro.The result lags behind the Galaxy S21 Ultra with its Snapdragon 888. And the mighty A14 Bionic in the iPhone 12 Pro Max continues to dominate with 1,600 and 4,100 in the single and multi-core Geekbench 5 tests respectively.    In our graphics test, the Find X3 Pro hit a frame rate of 34 frames per second in 3DMark’s Wild Life benchmark. That’s on par with the S21 Ultra but behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max and its 41 FPS result. When it came to the Adobe Premier Rush 4K video transcoding test, the X3 Pro managed to convert a short 4K video clip to 1080p in 1 minute and 9 seconds in its best result. Other tests dropped the average time down to 1 minute and 55 seconds. As a result, the Oppo Find X3 Pro is beaten by the Galaxy S21 Ultra and iPhone 12 Pro Max, with the latter phone chewing through the test in 28 seconds.But in reality, benchmarks don’t really matter a great deal when it comes to actually using a phone. And the Find X3 Pro simply flew through everything. Thanks to what appears to have been a lot of optimization and a reasonably light smattering of software on top of Android 11, the Find X3 Pro feels very fast to use. Combine the 120Hz refresh rate with the app animation speed set to “Fast” and you’ve got a handset that’s snappier than the Galaxy S21 and as responsive as the best OnePlus phones, which have long been Android speed demons. The only real fly in the ointment, is the Find X3 Pro doesn't really feel much faster than its predecessor. Using the two side-by-side and the experience of flitting through apps and menus feels equally responsive. With a 4,500 mAh battery the Oppo Find X3 Pro has an extra 240 mAh over its predecessor. In our battery rundown test, which involves continuous web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness over 5G, the X3 Pro managed 9 hours and 59 minutes before giving up the electrical ghost. That's nearly an hour less than the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 10 hours and 53 minutes, but Cupertino’s handset is limited to 60Hz refresh rate. A more apt comparison would be to the Galaxy S21 Ultra with its 120Hz LTPO panel; Samsung’s handset lasted 10 hours and 7 minutes in its adaptive mode, but it has a 5,000 mAH battery. (Turn off adaptive mode, and the S21 Ultra lasts 11 hours and 25 minutes.)Where the Find X3 Pro plays an ace card is with its charging speed. Making use of Oppo’s 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 and a dual-cell battery design, the X3 Pro will fill up from empty to 40% capacity in just 10 minutes. It's basically one of the fastest charging phones around. And Oppo's flagship now has 30W AirVOOC charging, something the X2 Pro lacked. That means the Find X3 Pro will charge to full in 80 minutes on a compatible wireless charger. It will also work with less powerful wireless chargers. Completing the charging package and pushing the X3 Pro into firm flagship territory is support for 10W reverse charging. And unlike the flagship Apple and Samsung phones, Oppo puts a charger into the Find X3 Pro’s box. ColorOS has become one of my favorite user interfaces added onto Android. It's relatively unfussy in the vein of OnePlus’ OxygenOS. But it also allows for a lot of customization and extra features to be toggled, without getting in the way of things, like Samsung’s OneUI can do at times. ColorOS 11.2 retains the best bits of Android 11 and lightly adds to it, while streamlining the UI over its predecessor. For example, Oppo has ditched the Opera browser the X2 Pro came with out of the box, and a swipe left on the home screen now serves up the Google app rather than the Oppo Smart Assistant. That’s a neat touch, as the Google app offers a much richer vein of information, whereas I found the Smart Assistant to be lacking. Oppo has added features in the form of more customization options, notably the ability to tune the dark mode and the Always On display to your taste. There's also a redesigned Oppo Relax app, if being told how to chill out by your phone is your cup of tea. And at some point, ringtones made in conjunction with Hanz Zimmer will be rolled out to the Find X3 Pro, though they weren't available to listen to at the time of writing. ColorOS 11.2 builds upon the security features of Android 11 by offering more privacy controls, such as being able to create a separate system to keep your apps and data apart from the original system and locked behind a password of fingerprint. Speaking of which, the in-display fingerprint sensor is very responsive, but it sits a little lower than it did on the Find X2 Pro; I preferred the latter's scanner position, but I soon got used to the X3 Pro’s sensor. There are also visual enhancements for video content provided by the Q1 Ultra Vision Engine. It can either sharpen the resolution of videos or enhance standard dynamic range videos into HDR. While it’s far from essential, it's a nice-to-have feature and is better than the Find X2 Pro’s take, which tends to boost video motion to 60 fps, lending a slight soap opera look to movies and TV series design for a lower frame rate.And finally, there’s the Game Space app that allows you to customize your gaming experience on the Find X3 Pro. It's similar to the X2 Pro’s app, only with a few extra options for tweaking performance profiles.In short, there's a lot of customization and relatively powerful features sitting behind ColorOS’ rather neat interface.As it stands there are only two real flagship phone contenders, Samsung and Apple, now that HTC is out of the smartphone game and LG hasn't made a compelling high-end Android phone in a while. iPhone fans are not likely to be swayed by the Find X3 Pro. But Oppo's latest flagship could be a serious rival to the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which has been pretty much sitting at the top of the Android flagship hill without any real competition, until now. GIven that it undercuts the Galaxy S21 Ultra yet still delivers a premium ""big phone"" experience with impressive cameras and performance, the Find X3 Pro is what I’d consider to be a true Android flagship contender. However if you have a Find X2 Pro, then you can skip the X3 Pro. While this new model is a better phone than its predecessor, there’s not quite enough to warrant an upgrade. Furthermore, it could be worth seeing what the rumored OnePlus 9 Pro has to offer when it’s revealed on March 23. But if you want a serious Android flagship right now, then you really need to consider the Oppo Find X3 Pro. And if you’re reading this from Samsung HQ, take the X3 Pro as a warning shot that Oppo is gunning for the Android smartphone crown."
63,Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review,"OS: Android 11 / ZenUIScreen size: 6.78-inch AMOLED (2448 x 1080); 60 - 144HzProcessor: Snapdragon 888RAM: 18GBStorage: 512GBRear cameras: 64MP ultrawide (f/1.8), 13MP ultrawide (f/2.4), 5MP macro (f/2.0)Front camera: 24MP (f/2.45)Video: Up to 8K at 30 fpsBattery: 6,000 mAhBattery life (Hrs:Mins): 13:13 (60Hz) / 11:17 (120Hz) / 10:21 (144Hz)Charging: 65WColors: WhiteSize: 6.1 x 2.7 x 0.4 inchesWeight: 8.4 ouncesIn addition to the ROG Phone 5 and ROG Phone 5 Pro, Asus announced a limited edition ROG Phone 5 Ultimate. This particular model is seen as the cream of the crop, the king of the pack, loaded with 512GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage and a whopping 18GB of RAM. Asus wants it to be the ultimate gaming smartphone and truth be told, it delivers on many fronts.The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate also shares the same weaknesses as its brethren, notably poor camera performance, but it levels up the rest of the experience in marginal ways. In our Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate review, we’ll go over what’s different about this model versus the ROG Phone 5 and what the two Asus phones have in common. If you want the full lowdown on how the newest generation of ROG Phone performs, then be sure to check out the Asus ROG Phone 5 review.As one of the best gaming phones available, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate commands a price to match that lofty position. It’s available for €1299. As far as we know, it won’t be officially coming to the US, though Asus could change its mind down the road. Finding the phone may be a challenge. Asus says that the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is meant to celebrate the ROG brand and the gamers that have built it up over the years. But unlike the standard ROG Phone 5 which will be widely available, the Ultimate edition has limited stock. The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate lacks mmWave 5G, instead simply opting for sub-6Ghz 5G. This omission is likely because mmWave is really only a major thing with Verizon in the US, but if this phone ever makes it to the US, you’ll be limited to sub-6. This is fine, because all the ROG Phone 5 models are GSM-only, so they won’t work on Verizon’s network anyway.All that RAM: The extra storage on the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate  is definitely a bonus, but the 18GB of RAM feels like overkill. Not once in my time with the phone did the OS come close to using that much memory. Asus claims that the ridiculous amount of RAM will allow you to keep more games in memory, meaning lower loading times. While technically accurate, I don’t see the use case here. In what circumstance am I going to be playing a game and then think, “Let’s jump to another game, but curse the universe if I have to wait a few extra seconds for it to load!” Not to mention that ZenUI, Asus’ custom Android skin, likes to kill background apps that hang out in RAM too long. Honestly, the 18GB of RAM inside the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a bragging right passed off as something beneficial to the user. It doesn’t hinder the experience in the slightest, but it doesn’t really add that much in real world use, either.More controls: Beyond the extra RAM, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate features two extra touch sensor zones on the back of the phone. These controls join the ultrasonic AirTriggers on the frame of the device. You can map actions to the sensor zones in much the same way. They act like paddles while you play, but like the AirTriggers themselves, I found them only slightly useful for actual gameplay, depending on the game.ROG Vision: The base model ROG Phone 5 features an RGB dot matrix display on the back of the phone that you can customize. However, on the ROG Phone 5 Pro, you get a color PMOLED display. You can customize what it displays, including some pretty awesome images.The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate uses a PMOLED display, too, but it’s monochrome instead of color. Asus went with this to keep the design language consistent with the rest of the Ultimate’s aesthetic. You still get to customize what the little display shows, adding an eye-catching bit of flair to the back of the phone.An extra accessory: The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate comes with the separate AeroActive cooler included, though it’s not white, unfortunately. The accessory works just the same as it does should you buy it separately for the base model ROG Phone 5, and it does make a marked difference in surface temps on the phone. The AeroActive also features extra paddles if you want them.Other than what’s listed above, the specs and features on the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate are the same as what you’d get with the £799/€799 ROG Phone 5. The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate also features all the same software goodness as the base model. That means all the charging options, over-the-top Game Genie for game optimizations, and other tweaks available in the ZenUI settings like gestures and theme packs are on this phone.Battery test results vary slightly, but they are still within the same ballpark. That’s not a surprise, as the same mammoth 6,000 mAh battery, split into two 3,000 mAh packs, that powers the ROG Phone 5 also is found in the Ultimate edition. In the battery-efficient 60Hz mode, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate lasted for a whopping 13 hours and 13 minutes. In 120Hz mode, it ran for 11 hours and 17 minutes. And at 144Hz, it managed 10 hours and 21 minutes.Unfortunately, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate retains the so-so camera performance of the base model. The triple camera setup looks good on paper — a 64MP main camera is joined by a 13MP ultrawide angle lens and a dedicated 5MP macro shooter. But the photos that the ROG Phone puts out are just disappointing. Even under optimal lighting conditions, the images look flat, bland, and devoid of life. And then there's the night mode, which isn't up to par with other similarly-priced phones.I took out the Ultimate alongside the Galaxy S21 Plus and the difference was staggering. Compare the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate to the iPhone 12 Pro or Pixel 5, and the difference is even more noticeable. The ROG Phone 5 can’t hold a candle to the best camera phones in terms of output, and it would struggle against more middling competition.You don’t buy a phone like the Asus ROG Phone 5 because you’re interested in mobile photography, even considering its lofty price. The games are the thing, and the Ultimate, like the main ROG Phone 5, delivers on that front. These new phones from Asus top every other Android device, though they struggle to match the iPhone 12 series’ power. Apple’s A14 Bionic is silicon magic and the Snapdragon 888 is just shy of equaling it.The ROG Phone 5 is the most powerful Android device we’ve tested yet, but it’s telling that the iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 12 Pro Max are not only better phones all around, but they’re also gaming devices of a similar caliber. They may lack the huge battery, AirTriggers, touch sensors, and AeroActive cooler, but they also work on all carriers and support both mmWave and sub-6 5G. The ROG Phone 5 is limited to GSM carriers and sub-6GHz 5G.If you only care about a premium mobile gaming experience, then the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is for you. It has insane power, ridiculously long battery life, and all the features and gimmicks you could want. But it’s not as good as the best phones, thanks to those subpar cameras, which limits the ROG Phone’s appeal outside of gaming circles."
64,Nokia 8.3 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/nokia-83-5g,"Price: $699 Display: 6.81-inch LCD (2400 x 1080; 60Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 765G RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.9); 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2); 2MP macro; 2MP depth Front camera: 24MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 4,500 mAh Size: 6.8 x 3.1 x 0.35 inches Weight: 7.76 ouncesRecent months have seen an explosion in the number of $699 phones that balance some premium features with prices well below what you’d pay for a flagship device. Include the Nokia 8.3 5G in that group. Like its fellow $699 phones, this device built by HMD Global offers a reliable processor and a list of other specs that, on paper, seem quite competitive for the asking price. It certainly offers a better bang for buck than the Nokia 7.2.And yet to my dismay, I don’t like the Nokia 8.3 5G. Sure, there are some clear positives to go with that affordable price. But with so many other similarly priced phones on the market, our Nokia 8.3 5G review revealed an ultimately lackluster device that doesn’t offer anything truly special to stand out from the crowd. Lacking some features that others have for the same cost makes it very forgettable.Note that there are actually two 5G phones carrying the Nokia 8 name — this model and the Nokia 8 V 5G UW, which is an identically priced version retooled to work with Verizon’s high-speed 5G network. Other than that, these two Nokia 8 devices are essentially the same.HMD Global actually introduced the Nokia 8.3 5G nearly a year ago, though it didn’t reach the U.S. until very late in 2020. The $699 phone is available unlocked from Amazon as well as the Nokia website. That $699 gets you a phone with 128GB of storage — double the amount found in the Verizon version of this same phone — and 8GB of memory.Over in the UK, you’ll fork over £499.99 for a 64GB/6GB variant and in Australia, you get the same specs as the US for AU$899. As far as the US is concerned, the Nokia 8.3 5G faces fierce competition from the likes of the Pixel 5 ($699), the Galaxy S20 FE ($699), the OnePlus 8T ($749). But there are even cheaper 5G phones like the Pixel 4a 5G ($499) and Galaxy A71 5G ($599) that measure up well against the Nokia 8.3. That presents HMD Global with an uphill battle in trying to carve out a space for this device. And as we’ll see, it isn’t always successful.I’ll just get the obvious out of the way. The Nokia 8.3 5G is a big phone — a real Oh Lawd He Comin’ on the Chonk Cat scale. I have large hands, and I can safely say that this is a two-handed device that’s difficult to stash in a pocket.The Nokia 8.3 5G comes in at 6.8 x 3.1 x 0.35 inches and a weight of 7.76 ounces. For reference, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, a large device in its own right, measures 6.5 x 3 x 0.32 inches and weighs 7.34  ounces. So surprisingly, the Nokia 8.3 is the heavyweight of these two devices.Beyond that, the Nokia 8.3 5G is a looker with a gorgeous deep blue finish on the back. It’s a fingerprint magnet, though, but when it’s wiped clean, it’s beautiful. I’ll hand it to HMD —  they designed a really pretty phone that catches light wonderfully.The round, Zeiss-branded quad camera module sticks out noticeably from the Nokia 8.3’s back, meaning the phone doesn’t lay flat when you set it down on a table. For some reason, this has always bugged me, but your level of irritation may vary.Along the right side of the frame is the Nokia 8.3’s SIM/SD card tray, the volume rocker, and the power button, which doubles as the fingerprint sensor. Over on the left side is the Google Assistant button all by its lonesome. That’s an awkward placement that invites accidental presses, should you try to unlock the phone thinking you’re hitting the power button. It doesn’t help that both buttons are placed directly opposite of each other. Over on the face of the Nokia 8.3 5G, there’s a hole punch cutout for the front-facing camera in the top left corner and a rather noticeable chin with a Nokia logo. I’m not a huge fan of the design direction here, especially with the comparatively large bottom bezel. Other phones in this price range minimize the chin, but HMD Global seemingly hasn’t gotten the memo.The Nokia 8.3 5G lacks any kind of IP rating for water resistance, so be careful with it near water. There’s also no wireless charging, something similarly priced rivals such as the Pixel 5 offer. My other disappointment with the phone physically is the mono bottom-firing speaker. It’s tinny and doesn’t sound good at all. Notifications and system sounds made me grit my teeth, so I set the phone to vibrate and forgot about it until I watched a YouTube video. Having come from using a Pixel 4 XL and its stereo speakers, I found the Nokia 8.3 5G’s audio rather underwhelming.Don’t get me wrong, I mostly like the design of the Nokia 8.3 5G, even if it is a behemoth. Plus, there’s a headphone jack on the bottom next to the USB-C port, something a lot of phone makers forego these days. There are just some quirks or poor decisions in other parts of the design that left me scratching my head. It’s the 6.81-inch 2400 x 1080 IPS LCD panel that makes the Nokia 8.3 5G so big. You get a 20:9 aspect ratio with a grand total of 386 pixels per inch, meaning that it’s not as sharp as a QHD display, though resolution will be fine for most people.Colors are plenty vibrant with the display covering 142.5% of the sRGB color gamut. That’s more than the 128.8% covered by the Pixel 5 and about equal to the 140.6% covered by the LG Velvet, one of the more colorful displays we’ve seen among the $699 phones. Contrast on the Nokia 8.3 5G is pretty good, and the display’s brightness hit a maximum of 607 nits with adaptive mode turned on. That’s about equal with the 610 nits that the Pixel 5 managed. Overall, the Nokia 8.3 features a nice LCD panel, even if it lacks the punch of an OLED with noticeably weaker blacks to boot.When discussing color accuracy, the Nokia 8.3 5G’s display hits a Delta-E score of 0.28 in our lab tests (where the lower score is best). That beats the Galaxy S20 FE’s 0.3 and the OnePlus 8T’s 0.29.The big display is great for media consumption, especially gaming. Playing Xbox Game Pass titles such as Destiny 2 or Master Chief Collection was a joy especially with headphones hooked up. Dare I call the Nokia 8.3 5G screen immersive? I think so. It may not win awards, but it gets the job done with decent colors and good brightness.The sad part about the Nokia 8.3 5G’s display is that the refresh rate is locked at 60Hz. If you haven’t experienced Android at higher frame rates before, I’d forgive you for not caring. But once you see a 90Hz screen like the Pixel 5’s or 120Hz like the Galaxy S20 FE,  it’s really hard to forget how smooth scrolling is on those comparably priced phones.The Nokia 8.3 5G’s quad camera setup features a 64MP main shooter, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. Many of the images shot under well-lit conditions offer decent colors and detail. The ultrawide sensor is also fun and produces some good wide-angle pictures, perfect for large groups or landscape shots. Only half of the camera array is useful, however, with the macro proving to be effectively pointless in comparison to a good zoom on the main lens. I also didn’t notice too much use of the depth sensor in my photos compared to what I captured with my Pixel 4 XL — if anything, the Nokia’s shots appear to lack depth in comparison to the Pixel’s pictures. You can see some real differences between the Nokia 8.3 5G and my Pixel 4 XL in this sample shot of a forest. The Nokia 8.3 5G seems to have overexposed the scene, while the Pixel captured sharp details and has a better sense of depth. The Nokia’s shot feels almost flat in comparison. There’s not a whole lot of color or light going on in this scene, but the Pixel’s image is noticeably better than the Nokia’s.In this photo of my living room window (from the ground level under pitch black conditions), you can see the true difference between Google’s Night Sight and the Nokia 8.3 5G’s night mode. The Pixel 4 XL pulls in so much more light and contains less noise than the Nokia’s effort. While you can still make some details, like the bricks and mortar of my house, the Nokia shot is noticeably darker. Both photos caught some of the tree shadows cast from a distant street light, which impressed me, even if the Pixel’s is clearer. The Pixel 4 XL also captured the colors of the railroad bridge much better than the Nokia 8.3 5G. The latter warmed up the temperature more than the Pixel, making the rust look much more orange than it is in real life. Everything about that bridge is faded and the Pixel captures that true-to-life detail.Let’s chat about the portrait mode on the Nokia 8.3 5G. I had my photographer stand the same distance away from me with both phones, and you can clearly see the differences in just the zoom levels, though that’s not the biggest takeaway from this comparison. More critically, there’s a difference in how much light both phones bring in, with the Pixel 4 XL being a clear winner in both brightness and clarity. Toward the bottom of the picture on my sleeves, the Nokia made things noisy and blurry. If I was going to post either on my Instagram, the Pixel is the obvious winner with both its realism and artistic vibe. When discussing the performance of the Nokia 8.3’s 24MP selfie cam, you can see some notable differences between its self-portrait and the one I shot with the Pixel 4 XL. The Nokia cooled things down a lot, likely due to the blue from my shirt. The Pixel, meanwhile, captured the light better and kept the temperature much closer to reality. It also brought in the blue and even the threads of my shirt better than the Nokia, which sort of flattened my attire like it did with the outdoor shot we talked about at the top of this section.The Nokia 8.3 5G rocks a Snapdragon 765G, a step down from the Snapdragon 865 found in many of last year’s flagship Android phones. Still, the 765G is a very capable and reliable chip, and unless you’re a spec junky, this chipset will be more than enough for your needs. The Nokia 8.3 5G flies without a hitch, locking and unlocking quickly. Animations remain smooth and consistent, apps open almost immediately, and gaming performance is strong. The 8GB of RAM inside the Nokia 8.3 5G also helps things run well, and I’m very impressed with how the Nokia 8.3 5G feels in daily use. I never once was left wanting for more oomph.In Geekbench 5, the Nokia 8.3 5G scored 1,878 for multicore. Compared to Snapdragon 865-powered phones like the Galaxy S20 FE (2,928) and OnePlus 8T (3,203), that is a lower score. But it was also better than a lot of other Snapdragon 765G-based phones like the Pixel 5 (1,617 on Geekbench 5) or the Snapdragon 765-powered Samsung Galaxy A71 5G (1,796).In the graphics department, the Nokia 8.3 5G managed to earn a score of 1,664 (10 frames per second) in the 3DMark Wildlife Unlimited test. That was better than the Pixel 5 (1,160), but slightly behind the LG Velvet (1,680).As noted, the Nokia 8.3 5G works just fine with low-band 5G coverage like the nationwide networks launched by AT&T and T-Mobile. If you want high-speed millimeter wave-based 5G, though, you’ll need to look elsewhere — like the Nokia 8 V 5G UW.Battery life is one of the Nokia 8.3 5G’s strongest selling points. The efficient Snapdragon 765G combined with the 4,500 mAh battery powering the phone makes for an excellent team, easily getting through two days in my use. Your mileage will vary depending on what you do and what you have going on in the background, but it’s possible to skip charging this at night sometimes.While we tested the Nokia 8.3 5G’s battery using the custom Tom’s Guide test where we have a phone surf the web over cellular until it runs out of power, we ran into a strange problem where the device would shut off with 10% of its battery still left. While we tried some fixes, including consulting with HMD Global, we were never able to run the test to its full completion, so we can’t include the Nokia 8.3 5G on the best phone battery life list. That’s a shame, because the phone was usually around the 10 hours, 12 minutes mark when it hit 10% and shut down, so it likely would have lasted more than 11 hours. It certainly beat the Nokia 8 V 5G, which only lasted 8 hours and 26 minutes on the full test.The Nokia 8.3 5G offers decent recharge speeds, getting back to 36% after half-an-hour of charging. That’s about equal to the Nokia 8 V 5G (34%), and Motorola Edge 5G (36%). An iPhone 12 mini can get to 60% in that time if you spring for a 20W charger. Software is another of the Nokia 8.3 5G’s strengths. HMD Global is one of the last holdouts for the Android One program, which ideally operates a lot like Google’s own Pixels do with fast updates. Out of the box, you have a very stock, Pixel-like Android experience. There’s no fluff, no tweaks, just a clean interface. Having used Pixels (and Nexuses before them), I’m well accustomed to Google’s semi-minimalist vision. People who are used to Samsung’s One UI or something similar may find things to be a bit spartan, but trust me, you’ll adjust.There is, however, a sticking point with the software. See, HMD Global has promised two OS updates for the Nokia 8.3 5G, which is all well and good until you realize that Android 11 is one of those updates since this phone ships with Android 10 out of the box. That means the phone won’t receive an Android version update past this year’s Android 12, especially with the Android 11 update now arriving on the Nokia 8.3.Compromise is the name of the game with the Nokia 8.3 5G. Considering its “affordable flagship” pricing, I honestly expected more from this phone given what other similarly priced devices offer. But $699 earns you a Nokia phone with no wireless charging, IP rating or special features beyond 5G connectivity.I have a soft spot for the Nokia brand name, so I wanted to like this phone. But when your $699 can buy you a Galaxy S20 FE or a Pixel 5, both of which have more to offer, it’s hard to justify a Nokia 8.3 5G purchase. And for $200 less, you can grab yourself a Pixel 4a 5G with the same Snapdragon 765G SoC and a better camera. Despite some great performance and battery life, a good display and a pleasant software experience, there’s not a lot that stands out about the Nokia 8.3 5G. In a world with so many similarly priced competitors, this is a phone that gets lost in a crowd."
65,TCL 10 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/tcl-10-pro,"Price: $449 OS: Android 10 with TCL UI Display: 6.47-inch AMOLED (2340x1080) CPU: Snapdragon 675 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB; expandable up to 256GB Rear camera: Quad-lens: 64MP wide (ƒ/1.8), 16MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.4), 5MP macro (ƒ/2.2), 2MP low-light (ƒ1.8) Front camera: 24MP (ƒ/2.2) Battery: 4,500 mAh Size: 6.24 x 2.85 x 0.34 inches Weight: 6.6 ouncesWell-known TV maker TCL has been building phones for years —  just not ones with its name on the back. That’s changing, starting with the $449 TCL 10 Pro.The 10 Pro isn’t the only new phone from TCL; there’s also the $249 TCL 10 L and, sometime over the summer, a 5G variant will emerge for less than $500. But this Pro model is still the range-topper in many ways, as it’s the only one of the trio with an OLED display, and it sports the most stunning design of the bunch.Our TCL 10 Pro review reveals a phone that marks a strong debut for TCL in the ever-competitive arena of midrange handsets that’s been dominated by Google and Apple as of late. While the TCL 10 Pro isn’t perfect, it’s still among the best cheap phones you can buy, and a compelling choice for anyone on the hunt for a premium design, flagship-caliber display and long battery life for under $500 — so long as you don’t mind the average cameras.The TCL 10 Pro reached stores May 19 for $449 unlocked, and it comes in only one configuration and color — 128GB of storage with 6GB of RAM, in the Ember Gray shade. TCL offers the 10 Pro in other, more interesting colors elsewhere in the world, but unfortunately gray is all on offer in the U.S.There’s a microSD slot in the TCL 10 Pro, and it accepts cards up to 256GB in size. Best Buy, Walmart and Amazon sell the phone, and you’ll be able to take it to GSM carriers, like AT&T, T-Mobile and Metro. Unfortunately, the lack of CDMA bands means that the 10 Pro doesn’t fully support carriers like Verizon, Sprint and Boost Mobile.In Canada, the TCL 10 Pro is offered at Bell for $700 CAD and Telus for $665 CAD. Canadians can also get a free 43-inch TCL TV (a $319 CAD value) with the purchase of a TCL 10 Pro; all you have to do is go to TCL's website to register your purchase and get in on the deal.While the TCL 10 Pro technically qualifies as a midrange handset, TCL doesn’t sell a phone that’s more expensive, and so this $449 phone actually serves as something of a flagship for the brand.Thankfully, the TCL 10 Pro looks like a flagship, too. We’re used to seeing concessions in design and build quality at this price point: The Pixel 3a and Samsung Galaxy A51 are made from polycarbonate, rather than metal and glass, while the new iPhone SE 2020 repurposes a very, very old design that likely doesn’t cost Apple much to keep pumping out these days.The TCL 10 Pro, however, isn’t molded from plastic at all. Instead, it sports a solid, powder-coated metal chassis with a satiny, matte-etched glass back that looks and feels similar to what OnePlus employs on some of its products. Couple those materials with the 10 Pro’s full-screen design, and suddenly, TCL has a design winner on its hands.In fact, I’d go so far as to say that this isn’t just one of the best-designed phones under $500 — it is the best. I especially love the way the quad cameras and dual-LED flash have been lined up horizontally around the back, in a glossy strip that breaks up the frosted texture blanketing the rest of the sheet of glass. The 10 Pro would be an attractive $800 phone, but at its actual $449 price, it feels truly special.Mind you, it’s not perfect. The 10 Pro’s display is steeply curved on its sides and that can lead to some unintentional touches, which gets pretty annoying. There’s only one speaker on this phone, and it’s on the bottom right, meaning sound can get easily muffled as you’re playing games. There’s also no IP-rated water resistance or wireless charging on board here, though those aren’t surprising omissions in this segment.There are still a couple more positives worth noting, however. The first is the 10 Pro’s headphone jack, which resides on the upper top edge and means you won’t have to ditch those trusty old wired earbuds for an expensive wireless pair.The second is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor, which isn’t the fastest scanner in the world, but quick enough and, more importantly, pretty accurate. In fact, I’ve experienced less false negatives with the 10 Pro’s sensor than the one inside the Galaxy A51, especially when attempting to unlock the TCL 10 Pro after washing and drying my hands. TCL’s system is even quite good at reading your prints when the phone is lying flat on a table, which I find to be a challenge with most optical scanners.Front and center on the TCL 10 Pro, you’ll find the phone’s 6.47-inch Nxtvision AMOLED display, which packs a full-HD resolution and HDR 10 certification. Nxtvision is TCL’s branding for its proprietary display engine, which is borrowed from the company’s own television panels.However, Nxtvision is more than a behind-the-scenes technology — it’s also an app inside the 10 Pro that allows you to tune the appearance of the panel to your liking. When Nxtvision visual enhancement is on, contrast and colors are adjusted in real time to take advantage of the screen’s wide color gamut. A separate SDR-to-HDR option allows you to get non-HDR content up to spec, though to my eyes, this setting doesn’t make a world of difference. Occasionally it amounts to a slight-but-appreciated saturation boost, while other times it adds a little too much punch to intentionally-dim or muted scenes.Of course, you can turn all this off if you like to, and opt for a middle-of-the-road Standard color profile or an even more toned-down Gentle option that appears to be emulating sRGB with no flashy effects. I preferred the Standard look personally, and under that guise I was impressed as I watched the trailer for Netflix’s Space Force, taken in by the view of a rocket perched and ready for launch below an endless silvery-blue desert sky.On Standard mode, the TCL 10 Pro covered 172.3% of the sRGB color space. That translates to noticeably more vibrant colors than the 111.2% iPhone SE, which utilizes an LCD panel. However, the iPhone’s hues were more realistic, as Apple’s phone notched a Delta-E score of 0.20 compared to the TCL’s 0.28 (numbers closer to zero are better).All that’s well and good, and if that were the end of the display conversation, I’d rather have the TCL’s panel, as it’s rare to find an OLED screen this good for such a low price. But for all TCL’s Nxtvision bells and whistles, the 10 Pro’s display comes up short in one very important respect: brightness. Whereas the iPhone SE can be cranked all the way up to 625 nits, this handset tops out at 398 nits, making outdoor viewing a little more difficult than it should be.TCL says the display was primarily the focus for its first series of phones, though, judging by the quantity of lenses on the back of the TCL 10 Pro, it hasn’t skimped on cameras, either.The quad-lens camera system on offer here combines a 64-megapixel primary wide-angle shooter with a 16-MP ultrawide one, a 5-MP macro camera and a 2-MP sensor devoted to low-light shots. The front of the TCL 10 Pro features a 24-MP camera which, it must be said, is more megapixels than you typically get for selfies.Photos captured with the 10 Pro’s 64-MP main lens incorporate quad-pixel binning to allow more light to reach the sensor, so the result is 12-MP regardless. That equals the iPhone SE’s resolution, and thus, this pair of shots of a mandevilla flower from both phones are similarly sharp. However, there’s a massive gap in color and detail; the hues on the TCL phone are boosted into the stratosphere, such that the texture of the petals and leaves are totally absent. Imperfections that are noticeable on the iPhone SE’s take are curiously absent in the 10 Pros’ rendition, as they’ve been smoothed over with excessive blur.What makes this particular comparison worse is that you’re seeing an example of the kinds of photos the TCL 10 Pro delivers when its AI scene detection engine is off. When that feature is on, the colors are even more ridiculous, with a degree of eye-searing oversaturation I’ve rarely seen from a smartphone camera, even at this low price. These photos were taken on a sunny day, and the flower is naturally vibrant; it definitely didn’t need any post processing to enhance those colors, and yet, TCL’s software went that far anyway.Thankfully, things begin to settle down when you compare the 10 Pro’s 16-MP ultrawide lens to the 12-MP one in Samsung’s Galaxy A51. There’s something about the extreme contrast of the A51’s shot that draws your eye in, but it’s false. TCL’s camera picked up the actual lighting of the scene, teasing more lavender out of the flowers on the crape myrtle tree to the right, while nailing the gradient of whites and grays composing the clouds overhead. The 10 Pro’s image also isn’t quite as noisy in the shadowy regions, like right below the roof of the house.Macro cameras are becoming increasingly more common, especially in cheaper phones. The TCL 10 Pro features a 5-MP sensor just for those shots, similar to the Galaxy A51. The A51’s macro lens is one of the few impressive standout features about its camera array, but I prefer shooting with the TCL 10 Pro’s macro, both because it proved quicker to focus in testing and because it allows you to get closer.In capturing this wind chime, notice how the ring around the marble is ever so slightly out of focus in the Galaxy’s shot, yet is rendered crisply by TCL’s phone. I also prefer the way the 10 Pro lit the background, with better dynamic range that properly captured the off-white siding of the house.The TCL 10 Pro also has a mode for shooting in low-light conditions, called Super Night Mode, and above you can see how it compares to Google's implementation of Night Sight in the Pixel 4. Now, this isn’t a totally fair comparison; the Pixel 4 is, of course, a legitimate flagship, rather than a midranger like the TCL 10 Pro. That said, I didn’t have a Pixel 3a on hand when conducting this TCL 10 Pro review, and besides, sometimes it’s good to see precisely what you’re missing when opting for a cheaper phone over a pricier one.Unsurprisingly, the Pixel 4’s attempt is better across the board; it’s sharper, it’s brighter and it manages to nail all the details, even the door lock in the lower-right corner of the frame. That said, Google’s software bathes everything in a warm light, which is one particular pitfall the 10 Pro’s Super Night Mode doesn’t suffer. It’s rare to see a compelling low-light setting on a budget device — well, aside from the Pixel 3a — and this is a particular area where TCL’s made sacrifices, even despite this handset’s dedicated lens for dim scenarios.Finally, we see how the 10 Pro’s selfie lens compares to the iPhone SE’s 7-MP front-facing shooter. Once again, even though the sensor in TCL’s camera starts with more pixels, it’s binning them together so that rather than 24-MP shots, you end up with a 6-MP product. That may explain why the TCL’s rendition isn’t quite as sharp as the iPhone’s, but there are various other ways in which the 10 Pro falls behind here. Half my face is blown out; my beard and hair are blurry; and for some reason, the phone made no attempt to correct for the sky above, resulting in white-hot clouds that ruin the result.The TCL 10 Pro’s selfie performance is probably its biggest letdown. In other respects, however, this is a middle-of-the-road midrange mobile camera. It’s certainly not at the level of the iPhone SE or Pixel 3a, but there are also worse options out there for the money, and at least having a plethora of lenses at your disposal offers a bit of versatility Apple’s and Google’s handsets lack.The TCL 10 Pro comes powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 675 processor — an evolution of the Snapdragon 670 chipset in the Pixel 3a — and 6GB of RAM. That combination makes it one of the most powerful phones under $500 today — well, so long as you ignore the A13 Bionic-powered iPhone SE.That iPhone is the exception among budget phones, though. And for what you’re paying, the Snapdragon 675 is a capable chip, fast enough to keep Android running as fluidly as it does on Snapdragon 865-powered flagships. You’ll notice some dropped frames and lower-resolution graphics during demanding titles, like Asphalt 9 Legends. Most of the time, though, you’d be hard-pressed to pick out the differences.Unlike with the Exynos-powered Galaxy A51 I recently reviewed, the TCL 10 Pro opens apps in a snap, even if they’re not already loaded into memory. It boots fast and responds instantaneously to gestures, too. With a multicore Geekbench 5 score of 1,604, the TCL 10 Pro outpaces the Galaxy A51 (1,293), Pixel 3a (1,336) and Moto G Power (1,387), indicating superior system-wide performance.However, things get interesting when you turn to graphics. The Snapdragon 675 may improve upon the 670 in terms of raw computational ability, but it actually fares worse with polygons, because it packs an Adreno 612 GPU to the older chipset’s Adreno 615. And so, TCL’s device comes up a bit short in the 1080p Vulkan edition of GFXBench’s Aztec Ruins test for midrange devices. Where the Pixel 3a clocked 12 frames per second and 783 frames in total, the 10 Pro manages just 8.5 fps, and 546 frames overall.The TCL 10 Pro performs well overall, but avid gamers may come away a little disappointed.Numbers are helpful, but the real question is, do the Adreno 612’s deficiencies make the TCL 10 Pro that much worse to game on compared to similarly-priced handsets? Honestly, I don’t think so.Samsung’s Galaxy A51 seems to handle Asphalt 9 a bit more smoothly than the TCL 10 Pro does on the whole, but the arcade racer is still certainly playable on TCL’s device, and neither phone can run that game properly at maxed settings anyway. Personally, I think TCL made the right choice in selecting silicon that prioritizes overall performance compared to graphics muscle, but avid gamers may come away a little disappointed.Inside the TCL 10 Pro is a large 4,500-mAh battery that kept the phone running for an average of 10 hours and 47 minutes in Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where devices endlessly load web pages over an LTE network.That’s just 13 minutes shy of the 11-hour mark, where you typically find the best phone battery life. The TCL 10 Pro doesn’t quite land on that list, but 10:47 is still very impressive; the Galaxy A51 only made it 9 hours and 16 minutes, despite carrying a similarly-large 4,000-mAh power pack, while the iPhone SE fared just 9 hours and 18 minutes. The 10 Pro’s result is a little more than an hour shorter than the Pixel 3a’s 11:59 runtime, however.TCL’s device comes with an 18-watt fast charger capable of getting the battery from empty to 50% in 35 minutes. That’s not blistering pace, though it’s better than you typically find in most cheap phones, which make do with 15-watt charging or a solution even slower than that.The TCL 10 Pro marks our introduction to the TCL UI — the company’s front end atop Android 10 that adds some useful functionality, while moving things around a bit.Like some other manufacturer Android skins, TCL UI has me split. On one hand, it’s not particularly attractive; there’s a lot of oversized text and generic iconography, and TCL’s system apps simply look dated and feel relatively unpolished. There are also a lot of frivolous settings that don’t seem to make a world of difference, like Game Turbo mode, which is supposed to “make the best performance for playing games” but outwardly demonstrates no noticeable change in practice.But then, TCL UI hatches a few pretty clever ideas — some simple and others more complicated — that add a bit of value rarely seen in this price range. For one, I love that when you press a volume key as media is playing, playback controls appear underneath the volume slider. It’s such an obvious yet thoughtful idea, though I’ve never seen it in any other phone.There’s also a programmable Smart Key on the left side of the phone to launch shortcuts or toggle settings, as well as a built-in IR blaster, meaning the TCL 10 Pro can double as your TV remote. The latter is a handy feature I wish more phone makers would bring back.On the other end of the complexity spectrum is Super Bluetooth — a feature that allows the 10 Pro to play audio concurrently on up to four separate Bluetooth devices. In theory, this feature sounds great, as it saves you from having to daisy chain multiple identical speakers to play music across a large space.Unfortunately, though, the execution is lacking. No matter how many times I tried, I couldn’t get the audio synchronization setup tool to work properly between my UE Boom and Google Home Mini. Sound still lined up reasonably well most of the time, but occasionally fell out of sync by a beat, or was paused when one of the speakers would drop connection entirely. I applaud TCL’s attempt to improve Bluetooth, but it’s such a frustrating technology to begin with, I’m not surprised the implementation is far from perfect.TCL promises at least one major Android version upgrade for the 10 Pro, which isn’t encouraging but also, unfortunately, is the status quo for cheap Android phones. Google supports all its Pixel devices with three years of updates, while you can expect even more than that from Apple for the new iPhone SE.Out of nowhere, TCL has arrived on the scene with a sub-$500 smartphone that’s actually worth buying.Sure, the TCL 10 Pro doesn’t have cameras to match those of the iPhone SE or Google’s budget Pixels, and it leaves something to be desired in terms of gaming performance and software. However, this device gets enough of everything else right that it’s at least a better choice for a mid-range Android handset than the Galaxy A51, which is quite an achievement for an up-and-coming brand looking to establish itself against icons like Samsung.The 10 Pro largely succeeds because of its combination of high-quality design with more satisfying materials than you typically see at this price, alongside strong everyday performance and long battery life. Plus, the 128GB of built-in storage is just icing on the cake in terms of value. It’s as good a debut as a company with everything to prove could have hoped for."
66,LG Wing,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lg-wing-review-hands-on,"Price: $999 OS: Android 10 Displays: 6.8-inch OLED and 3.9-inch secondary OLED CPU: Snapdragon 765G RAM: 8GB Storage: 256GB; expandable up to 2TB Rear camera: Triple-lens: 64MP wide (ƒ/1.7), 13MP ultrawide (ƒ/1.9), 12MP ultrawide with gimbal (ƒ/2.2) Front camera: 32MP Battery: 4,000 mAh Size (closed): 6.67 x 2.93 x 0.43 inches Weight: 9.74 ouncesWe've already seen some of the most ambitious phones ever in the last year, and yet the LG Wing still manages to stand out.It's a concept almost too ludicrous to exist. The LG Wing is a dual-screen phone, but you wouldn't know it by looking at it straight away. That's because the second panel is hiding behind the primary one, and is only revealed when the the big one on top is swiveled out of the way.It's jarring in pictures, even more jarring in real life, and while a neat party trick, it's not really the most elegant approach to dual-screens we've ever laid eyes on. The T-shaped result ultimately resembles two candy bar handsets glued together.But what they say about books and their covers also applies to the LG Wing. This phone can deliver some clever and useful software experiences by virtue of its weird design and gimbal-equipped camera. Unfortunately, our LG Wing review finds that the phone's high price and relatively poor performance, photo quality and battery life keep it from ascending to our list of the best phones.The LG Wing costs $999, and was initially released through Verizon. The device is now available from AT&T and T-Mobile as well.There's just one configuration of the Wing, with 8GB of RAM and a generous 256GB of storage; you can also expand available space by up to another 2TB with the use of a microSD card.At nearly 6.7 inches tall, more than four-tenths of an inch thick and tipping the scales at a smidge under 10 ounces, the LG Wing is a seriously massive phone. Even the super-sized Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is 2 ounces lighter and a tenth of an inch thinner. Those may sound like negligible numbers, but they make a massive difference in hand.I won't spend too much time on the Wing's design aside from the dual-screen aspect, but it's a handsome enough device, with an elegant matte aluminum frame and mirrored glass back, touched off with a triple-lens rear camera housing that almost looks lifted wholesale from Samsung's latest Notes.Inevitably, however, you forget about all of that the very first time you flick the Wing's primary 6.8-inch OLED display over to the left, revealing a 3.9-inch panel underneath. The top panel slides away with a light touch in one swift, smooth motion that slows down as it terminates and soft closes, in tandem with a simulated click from the software. Closing the display requires the use of two hands, though opening it can be done with the effortless swipe of a thumb.LG says the Wing is built to withstand 200,000 swivels, which the company estimates should last you five years. The whole mechanism feels very sturdy; during the pre-production preview phase, I noticed the slightest degree of vertical flexing when I gently try to lift that top display up and down, but LG seems to have stamped that out in the final product and the result is solid.When you spin that top screen to the side, you're greeted with a dual-screen home interface. On the 6.8-inch panel, you'll find what LG calls Swivel Home, which displays large app shortcuts in a horizontal fashion. On the other screen, you'll find your more conventional Android home screen interface. Interestingly, Android navigation bar gestures are accessible from both panels, as is the app drawer.Two points worth stipulating: LG is one of the lone phone makers committed to the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack, though you unfortunately won't find one in the Wing — there simply wasn't enough room, which is understandable when you consider LG had no choice but to stash the front-facing selfie camera inside a motorized pop-out mechanism. Additionally, with so many moving parts, the Wing is not certified water resistant in any capacity; slightly disappointing, albeit hardly surprising.While I've encountered some circumstances where the Wing isn't sure how to orient apps on both displays depending on the gyroscope's position, for the most part, my impressions of the Wing's user experience are positive.Not only does LG's software react fluidly and quickly when new apps enter the mix or assume the foreground (looking at you, Microsoft Surface Duo), but the company has devised some pretty clever uses for the extra real estate when you're not multitasking.For example, if you're watching a YouTube video in portrait orientation, and then you flick the screen sideways, the video you're watching will take on a landscape crop, while the small screen will be employed for playback controls and volume and brightness sliders. The addition of a brightness slider is such a simple but smart idea, because it's often something I find myself adjusting when I decide to watch a video on my phone. The Wing puts that right within view.A small pop-out button on that second screen allows you to hide or show those additional controls, making it easy to then fire up a second app, like Google Chrome, for example, and have both chugging along at once. The Wing also allows pairing of apps you plan on using together — like, say, if you want to have YouTube playing on the main display while you browse Twitter on the other panel.Any app can run on that second screen, though some may have to be whitelisted in the device's settings, because they haven't been vetted by LG to deliver a consistent experience. The lone exception to this are games; Asphalt 9, for example, will exclusively use the second screen to display a track map, or to present LG's Game Tools, which offer a quick and easy way to toggle graphics settings, take screenshots and more.The LG Wing's dual-OLED display setup is certainly odd, but the quality of these screens is high.The phone's primary 6.8-inch panel packs a resolution just north of full HD, and hit 643 nits in our full-screen brightness test with adaptive brightness on. That's better than the iPhone 12's 569 nits, and bright enough to ensure comfortable outdoor viewing on either display — the phone increases the brightness of both screens simultaneously when you adjust the slider.The Wing's main display also covers 105% of the DCI-P3 color space in its Natural color mode, which translates into colors that pop, but don't sear your eyes with over-saturation.There are other available color profiles for those looking for hues that really burst off the glass, though I was satisfied with the appearance of on-screen content in Natural mode when I watched the trailer for the David Bowie biopic Stardust. In one scene, the red light from a concert stage bathed the crowd and Ziggy himself in crimson light, which juxtaposed the stark black of the shadows nicely.There's not much to say about the Wing's other screen — another OLED panel taking on a more square-like aspect ratio but a similar overall resolution in the neighborhood of full HD. Like the main screen, though, it makes do with a pedestrian 60Hz refresh rate, which is actually becoming quite dated for the price bracket the Wing is playing in. (The Galaxy S20 phones, which range in price from $699 to $1,399, all offer 120Hz refresh rates, for example.)The LG Wing's other marquee feature, besides its screens, pertains to its camera system. And while triple-lens shooters are hardly original by today's standards, the Wing differentiates itself from even more high-end devices with a gimbal-equipped ultrawide lens that can pan automatically or manually (via an on-screen joystick) for smooth motion.Although you'll find a primary 64-megapixel main camera and a 13MP ultrawide lens on the back of the Wing, it's the 12MP optic situated in the middle of the trio, specifically designed for video, that benefits from LG's new Hexa Motion Sensor technology.Interestingly, there's seemingly no way to make use of the gimbal unless you have the main display flipped open, as all the controls for the gimbal are housed in the secondary panel. This is a good idea though, because it leverages the Wing's unique form factor to make it better equipped for one-hand shooting, while also giving those controls a place to live, so they don't clutter up the viewfinder.At first glance, the array of gimbal shooting modes are quite vexing, though they're relatively quick to grasp in practice. There are three modes — Pan Follow, First Person View, and Follow — that each behave differently in terms of orientation and object tracking.I find the Wing's built-in gimbal exponentially easier to use than the Zhiyun motorized gimbal I've tried to use in the past — especially with Pan Follow mode, which keeps the subject in the frame for as long as possible by moving the lens irrespective of the phone, while also stamping out vertical juddering motions stemming from shaky hands.Follow Mode fully compensates for all movements on both axes by swiveling the lens, so that the horizon always remains level, while First Person View allows the horizon to tilt, and essentially produces videos most similar to normal shooting. If this is difficult to understand in text — and I’m sure it is — fortunately there’s a handy graphic in the bottom-left corner of the screen that helps keep you aware of the camera’s orientation at all times.When you turn to stills, though, the Wing struggles somewhat. Photos captured with the main camera tend to lack color and detail if lighting isn't ideal, while especially low-light shots exhibit lots of noise.Compare these indoor shots of some books and trinkets on a shelf. The Wing delivers a generally noisier shot, with white balance that is slightly off, contributing to a green cast. It also fails to home in on finer details, like the texture of the white wall in the background. The Pixel 5 produced a comparatively blemish-free result.You can see it here, in this shot of a fake plant, where both devices’ Portrait Modes are applied. The attempt from the Wing is far nosier and dimmer, with the solid wood surface and the plant’s green strands simply lacking necessary warmth. The bokeh also isn’t as pronounced as it is on Google’s phone, though in fairness, the Pixel 5 did erroneously apply some blur to the foreground, where it doesn’t belong.The Wing allows you to combine night and ultrawide camera modes — something the iPhone 12 can also do, though overall I actually prefer the results from LG’s phone. There is a little too much noise, especially in the sky, but I’m impressed with how sharply the Wing renders the building’s brick exterior and the window panes. On the other hand, Apple’s software more accurately grasps the actual colors and overall tone of the scene.Comparing the Wing’s selfie camera against the iPhone 12’s True Depth shooter, we see an overexposed result totally lacking necessary contrast. The color from my face and my orange beanie are drained; the sharpness of my hair and the texture in the cap’s fabric, blurred.Like a growing number of 5G phones, the LG Wing is powered by a Snapdragon 765G system-on-chip. That's the same processor found inside the LG Velvet, as well as many other lower-cost 5G-ready models, like the OnePlus Nord and the Google Pixel 4a 5G. That silicon is paired with 8GB of RAM.Performance is generally good, with the device acting satisfyingly quickly to switch between single-screen and dual-screen modes. Despite my slight reservations entering this review, the 765G is perfectly capable of supporting two apps at once and seems to be quite intuitive in terms of knowing what to do with them in the context of the phone's orientation and whether or not that second screen is in use.However, this being a 7-series Snapdragon chip, graphical muscle is lacking somewhat. Asphalt 9 Legends plays at a frame rate well under 30 frames per second, at a lower-than-native resolution and with jaggies and low texture detail abound. It's not totally unresponsive and it's not any worse than other handsets that employ this chip — though it is inferior to other models that cost the same, which either pack Qualcomm's faster 865 silicon or Apple's A14 Bionic chipset, if you're entertaining the prospect of buying iPhone.In the system-wide Geekbench 5 benchmark, the Wing delivered a multicore score of 1,891 points. For reference, the iPhone 12 Pro, which costs exactly the same as the Wing, hit 3,880, while Samsung's Galaxy Note 20 topped out at 3,182. Both start at $999, just like LG's device.Turning to 3DMark's Wild Life graphics benchmark, there we saw a 1,643 score at 9.8 frames per second. Both the iPhone 12 Pro (6,567, 39 fps) and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (4,164, 24.9 fps) handily surpassed the Wing here too.In fact, you can get a device about as powerful as the Wing at or less than half the price, if you opt for the new $399 TCL 10 5G UW or $499 Google Pixel 4a 5G. Both of these handsets feature 765G processors and 5G connectivity, though they obviously lack second screens and gimbal cameras. This is all to say that if you're buying the Wing for its performance, you're doing so for the wrong reasons.Backing the LG Wing's two screens is a 4,000-mAh battery, which matches the size of the power pack in Verizon's version of the LG's other new phone, the Velvet.As our testing of the AT&T version of the Velvet demonstrated, LG does have the capacity to produce devices that last a while on a charge. That phone in particular lasted 10 hours and 29 minutes in our custom web-surfing battery test, which is very good.The Wing, on the other hand, has an extra display and the addition of millimeter-wave radios for 5G on Verizon's network, which bite into power. Thus, in the very same battery test using the Wing, we only saw an average of 8 hours and 11 minutes with just one screen lit; with both screens on, that dropped to an average of 7:03.Thankfully, the Wing does at least charge quickly, hitting 57 percent from empty in 30 minutes with its included charger. It also supports wireless charging, which is very impressive, given everything this device has going on beneath the glass and metal.The LG Wing may not be the sleekest or most powerful phone in the world, but it is certainly a unique one. It's a function-over-form device in the most brazen way, and it's downright cumbersome to hold at times.Yet, the Wing really does encourage you to use it in ways you normally might not think to use your phone — a familiar trend among this year's most ambitious handsets, like the exciting-though-flawed Microsoft Surface Duo.The Wing's problem is that it makes big sacrifices with regard to performance, image quality and longevity on a charge in its dual-screen aspirations. The extra display real estate does lend itself well to multitasking, but in exchange for that, you're paying $1,000 for a device only half as powerful as its adversaries, that captures steady video but dreary stills.Even though I doubt the Wing will end up a booming critical or commercial success, it's refreshing to see a company of LG's stature in the industry experiment with ideas like this (or the LG Rollable that it showed off at CES 2021 with a promise of releasing later this year). The Wing is the first product borne out of the company's Explorer initiative, an in-house incubator to create mobile devices that reject the status quo of soulless slabs.There's no denying LG has taken risks here; the trouble is, those risks haven't entirely panned out well."
67,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review,"The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip has pulled off a feat that eluded the Galaxy Fold, Samsung’s original foldable device: The Z Flip can fit in your pocket when it’s closed.Price: $1,299 (LTE), $1,199 (5G) Screen (open): 6.7-inch Super AMOLED (2636 x 1080) Exterior screen: 1.1-inch Super AMOLED (300 x 112) CPU: Snapdragon 855 Plus RAM: 8GB Storage: 256GB Cameras: 2 12MP (main: f/1.8; ultra wide: f/2.2) rear/10MP (f/2.0) front Battery: 3,300 mAh Size (open): 6.6 x 2.9 x 0.28 inches Size (folded): 3.4 x 2.9 x 0.61-0.68 inches Weight: 6.5 ouncesThat wasn't the case with the original Fold, a device that opened up horizontally like a book to unveil a 7.3-inch display. The Galaxy Z Flip is different. This time around, Samsung uses a flip-phone design. (Yes, exactly like the Motorola Razr.) The Z Flip flips open vertically to reveal a 6.7-inch display that includes a layer of ultra-thin glass for an extra level of polish. More importantly, when the phone is shut, it's tiny — a closed-up Z Flip fits easily in my hand and my paws aren't exactly meaty.That’s a promising start for the Galaxy Z Flip, but is it enough to make this the foldable phone to beat? And more importantly, has Samsung done enough to justify the Z Flip’s four-figure asking price? Our Samsung Galaxy Z Flip review gets to the bottom of those key questions.Before you even examine the relative merits of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, one of its most appealing attributes may be its price. Debuting at $1,380 last year, the Galaxy Z Flip isn’t cheap by any stretch of the imagination. But in the world of pricey foldable devices, Samsung’s flip phone feels like a bargain.The Galaxy Z Flip’s $1,380 price was a $600 drop from the debut price of the Samsung Galaxy Fold. The Galaxy Z Flip also costs less than the $1,500 the Motorola Razr. And the price has fallen even further in the subsequent months, as you can now pick up a Galaxy Z Flip for $1,299.You can get the Galaxy Z Flip from AT&T, Best Buy and Samsung. However, these days, the focus is on the Galaxy Z Flip 5G, an updated version of the phone that came out after we published our Galaxy Z Flip review. The Galaxy Z Flip 5G features a more powerful Snapdragon 865 Plus processor with a 5G modem, and it makes some improvements to the multitasking features. Originally, $1,499, the Galaxy Z Flip 5G now now costs $1,199, which is the same price as the Galaxy S21 Ultra.We're focusing on the Galaxy Z Flip for this review, but everything with the exception of performance would be the same with the Galaxy Z Flip 5G.The distinctive thing about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip's design is its horizontal hinge, a contrast to the vertical hinge that the Galaxy Fold used. Samsung claims it can flip open 200,000 times. We haven’t put the hinge to that much use in our time with the Z Flip, but it does feel pretty durable. (According to the YouTube channel JerryRigsEverything, the Galaxy Z Flip’s display behaves more like plastic than glass when subject to various torture tests.) We’ve dropped the phone on a hardwood floor without damaging the hinge, outer case or display.More significantly, the Z Flip's hideaway hinge is designed to keep out dust. It's got a thin layer of fabric to make sure particles can't find their way into the gap that exists between screen and hinge. Dust is what felled the original version of the Galaxy Fold, forcing Samsung to delay that phone's release. This suggests that Samsung has learned its lessons.When open, the Galaxy Z Flip's screen measures 6.7 inches from corner to corner. Rather than using plastic to protect the panel — the tack taken by every foldable maker prior to the Z Flip — Samsung has turned to a new ultra-thin glass material that seems to make the display less prone to damage. The most definitive thing we can say in that regard is ""so far, so good,"" but at least the Galaxy Z Flip feels more polished than other foldable phones.Speaking of polish, you'll need to apply a lot to the exterior metal case of the Galaxy Z Flip. On our Mirror Purple edition of the phone, our fingerprints are very visible on the reflective glass exterior.  That's a shame, because it mars an otherwise stylish look that you'd be eager to show off, as the Mirror Purple is especially eye-catching. You can also opt for Mirror Black and — in some countries — Mirror Gold. When we first laid eyes on the Galaxy Z Flip, we thought Mirror Gold was the sharpest of its looks, but the light lavender glow of Mirror Purple has grown on us.Samsung has turned to a full-HD+ display for the Galaxy Z Flip, with a resolution of 2636 x 1080 pixels. That's a lower resolution than the quad-HD+ panels inside the Galaxy S20 series, but it's certainly sharper than the Razr's 6.2-inch, HD+ screen.If you had hoped that Samsung would figure out a way to get rid of the crease that marred the Galaxy Fold experience, you're going to be disappointed. There is indeed a crease where the top and bottom halves of the Z Flip's extended screen meet, and it's not that difficult to spot when the screen’s not in use. Still, when we were watching a video on Netflix or playing PUBG Mobile, the crease was lost in the inky black of the Galaxy Z Flip’s AMOLED panel. While you wish that a $1,380 phone wouldn’t have any visible crease, at least the Z Flip’s modest bend isn’t as noticeable as the Razr's gigantic crease.Samsung has managed to fit a pretty colorful display into the Galaxy Z Flip’s folding frame. In its default Vivid setting, the screen captured 200.8% of the sRGB color spectrum, which means bright, if saturated, colors. For context, the Galaxy S20 Plus captured 224.4% of the sRGB color spectrum. Switch the viewing mode to Natural, and you’ll see 122.1% of the sRGB color spectrum on the Galaxy Z Flip, comparable to what we registered when testing the Galaxy Fold’s Natural mode (124.8%.).Those colors could be more accurate. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip has a Delta-E rating of 0.31 in Vivid mode compared to the S20 Plus’ 0.36 rating — numbers closer to zero are better — but Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max tops both, with a Delta-E rating of 0.28. You’ll get more accurate colors when switching over to Natural mode on the Z Flip, where the color accuracy rating improves to 0.21.In real-world use, you’ll enjoy watching video on the Galaxy Z Flip’s screen, even if the 21.9:9 aspect ratio is probably more narrow than you’re used to on a mobile device. (For context, the 6.7-inch Galaxy S20 Plus offers a 20.9:9 aspect ratio, and the difference is noticeable.) On other phones, some scenes of the No Time to Die trailer on YouTube can seem overly dark, but you can still make out James Bond’s facial features even in the shadows. The phone also did justice to the colorful costumes in Dolemite Is My Name on Netflix.Shining a flashlight at the Galaxy Z Flip screen, we recorded 677 nits of brightness with a light meter. That’s not as bright as the Galaxy S20 Plus (847 nits) or iPhone 11 Pro Max (761 nits), but it’s a big improvement over the 552 nits we recorded when testing the Galaxy Fold. Still, when using the Galaxy Z Flip in broad daylight, we had to squint to see the camera controls until we maxed out the display brightness.That internal display is not the only screen on the Galaxy Z Flip. On the phone's exterior, you'll find a 1.1-inch Super AMOLED panel that's just big enough to notify you of incoming calls, texts and alarms. It can also display the date and time, so you're not flipping open the phone just to see what time it is.We had doubts about the utility of this screen, and we don’t like that Samsung placed it just to the left of the phone's dual exterior cameras. But the exterior panel serves several functions: You can use it as a mini-view finder to shoot selfies with the Z Flip closed. Just press the power button twice to summon up the viewfinder and then hit one of the volume buttons to snap the shot. You only see a sliver of your face, but it's still an ingenious way to save you from opening up the phone just for a self-portrait.Once you start using the Galaxy Z Flip, you’ll immediately notice how solidly built and sturdy it is. Compact though it may be, this is no flimsy phone. The outer case feels very substantial and opening the Z Flip takes some effort — we couldn’t pull it off one-handed, so we used one hand to steady the device and the other to  lift its screen. Forget about whipping the Galaxy Z Flip out of your pocket and snapping it open with a flick of your wrist like the flip phones of old.Then again, if you’ve used the foldable Motorola Razr, you wouldn’t see this as much of a problem. The build on Motorola’s new flip phone is one of its weakest points. The Razr proved difficult to flip open, it didn’t look like it would last long after too many accidental drops, and due to a design flaw, the flexible display actually lifts up from the chassis as you shut the device. None of these flaws are in evidence with the Galaxy Z Flip.There's no sound when you open or close the Galaxy Z Flip — in contrast to the creaky noise the Motorola Razr makes. The nature of the free-stop hinge means you can stop adjusting the angle of the flexible display wherever you wish and the device will hold its orientation. That's extremely useful if you want to capture a selfie or video chat while going hands-free.Samsung has dubbed this Flex mode, and when you enable it by opening the Z Flip into an L-shape, the top half of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip's screen serves as a viewing area while all your actions are on the bottom of the screen. Use the camera app in Flex mode, for example, and the top of the screen becomes a viewfinder while the bottom houses the shutter button and menu options. YouTube, which Google updated specifically for the Z Flip, displays the video in the upper portion of the screen, letting you scroll through comments and related content on the bottom. It’s a very clever use of the Z Flip’s unique design, but it would be even better if more apps took advantage of Flex mode.One other thing we appreciated when using the Galaxy Z Flip was how flat the phone lays against surfaces when fully opened. That allows you to set down the Z Flip and tap away without experiencing any wobbles. If that sounds like a small thing, consider that there’s always an angle at play with the Motorola Razr, even when fully opened. It's slight, but it's there and it's hard to ignore. It’s another flaw Samsung managed to avoid with its own foldable.If you're a mobile-photography aficionado, you might be ever so slightly disappointed by the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip's primary camera module, which pairs two 12-megapixel sensors — one with an ƒ/1.8 regular wide lens, and the other with ƒ/2.2 ultra-wide optics. While that's half the number of lenses you'll get from the Galaxy S20 Plus and Galaxy S20 Ultra, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip's cameras produced impressive results during our testing. Samsung's computational photography chops have been very close  to Apple and Google's levels over the past several years, and the Z Flip should more than suffice in this department.For example, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip's ultra-wide camera squares up nicely with the 12-megapixel one inside the iPhone 11 Pro. Samsung's algorithms definitely brighten the darker regions more aggressively than Apple's, and there are some regions — like the brick walkway toward the bottom of the frame — that seem a tinge blown out. Otherwise, there's a lot to like here.The Galaxy Z Flip does a decent job capturing this steak dinner, recreating the array of colors on the plate. But the same photo shot with an iPhone 11 Pro Max is warmer and presents a greater variety of textures on objects like the homemade potato chips and the lettuce leaves in the salad. The Z Flip also captures a wider view even though I hadn’t switched to the phone’s ultra wide angle lens. The result is more of the surrounding area, but there’s also a noticeable bend to the Z Flip’s perspective.The Night mode on the Galaxy Z Flip can hold its own against similar features on other devices, even if we’re not crazy about the fact that you have to dig into the More options on the Z Flip to enable it. The iPhone 11 Pro Max takes night shots automatically and its rendition of a mural features the kind of well-balanced coloring we expect from Apple’s phones. It also didn’t struggle with light from a nearby street lamp that casts a glare on the Galaxy Z Flip’s shot. Still, the Z Flip captures more detail around the mural, like the trees on the right side of the frame and the house on the left. These details sink into the shadows on the iPhone’s shot.There’s little differentiating how the Galaxy Z Flip and iPhone 11 Pro Max handled this photo of a statue in a residential area. You could argue that Samsung’s phone produces the better image, given that the palm tree fronds have some color in its rendition. The iPhone’s version overly darkens the trees.The real reason to take a photo of that statue, though, was to test out the ultra-wide-angle lens on the Galaxy Z Flip, and the result remains pleasing. You get a wider viewing angle in the Z Flip’s shot than what the iPhone 11 Pro Max produces, and the colors remain more vibrant in the Samsung photo. (One exception: the patches of blue sky are more alluring in the iPhone shot.) If the Samsung phone falls down anywhere on wide-angle shots, it’s that the phone loses focus. Notice the fuzziness around the parked cars in the right background of the Z Flip’s photo. That’s not something you see in the iPhone 11 Pro Max shot, where everything remains sharp. The Galaxy Z Flip doesn’t come with a telephoto lens, so to see if that’s a worthwhile sacrifice to make in a $1,380 phone, we relied on the camera’s digital zoom for a 2x look at the Oakland skyline. The shot’s not bad — the foreground is in sharp focus, the colors pop and the exposure’s fine. But zero in on the details, and you’ll see how an optical zoom like the one on the Galaxy S20 Plus is more up to the task. The S20 keeps the Tribune Tower and the Wells Fargo sign next to it in focus; those are fuzzier in the Galaxy Z Flip’s rendition.This portrait of my colleague Henry is also quite good, even if there are aspects we prefer from Apple's rendition. Henry's skin tone is a bit more natural through the iPhone's cameras, and of course the presence of a telephoto shooter on Apple's handset provides that more dramatic, zoomed-in look you probably want from a portrait. But the Z Flip appears to do a better job isolating Henry's clear glasses frames.A 10MP front camera peeks out of you from a punch-hole cutout in the center of the Galaxy Z Flip’s interior display, just like the selfie cams on the S20 and Galaxy Note 10. It does a decent job, but in this photo, shot in a challenging mixture of shadow and sunlight, the Z Flip produces muted colors and struggles with the shifts in lighting. Colors are more balanced in the photo captured by the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 12MP selfie cam — not just the person in the photo, but the surrounding garden as well. And the iPhone isn’t as aggressive with skin smoothing as the Galaxy Z Flip.One nice feature about the Galaxy Z Flip’s front camera is a Smart Selfie Angle component that automatically switches to a wide-angle shot when it detects more than two people are in the frame. The Galaxy Z Flip certainly detected the extra bodies in this shot and adjusted its focus accordingly — the feature probably works best for landscape selfies — though the issues with overexposure remain.Samsung may have skipped the latest, greatest Android processor in the Galaxy Z Flip when it neglected to give it Qualcomm's then-brand new Snapdragon 865. However, at least the company is using the next best chip available.That would be the Snapdragon 855 Plus, which debuted in 2019 in a small number of phones, including the OnePlus 7T. Because it's the 855 and not the 865, the Z Flip cannot connect to 5G networks — though it’s still very snappy, with 8GB of RAM. (If you want 5G, opt for the Galaxy Z Flip 5G and its more capable Snapdragon 865 Plus chipset.)Additionally, a standard 256GB of storage provides plenty of space for apps, media and games. Forget about the microSD slot you’ll find on most Samsung flagships, though.Samsung's latest foldable achieved a Geekbench 5 multi-core score of 2,689 points. The OnePlus 7T fared only slightly better than the Z Flip, notching a 2,759 score in Geekbench 5, while the Galaxy Fold and its slightly less powerful Snapdragon 855 chipset brought up the rear with a 2,619 tally. In other words, expect the Galaxy Z Flip to turn in comparable performance to 2019’s Android flagships, even if phones with newer silicon leave it in the dust. The Galaxy S20 Plus, for example, rides its Snapdragon 865 chipset to a 3,076 score in Geekbench.Graphics testing tells a similar story — the Galaxy Z Flip holds its own with devices that feature last year’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon system-on-chip while lagging behind newer flagship phones. On the GFXBench Aztec Ruins Vulkan test for high-tier phones, the Galaxy Z Flip’s score of 1,048 frames was in line with the 1,038 score produced by the Galaxy Fold. The Galaxy S20 Plus handily bested both foldable Samsung devices with a result of 1,319 frames. This isn’t to say that the Galaxy Z Flip is a laggard. It kept up with any app I threw at it, even demanding games like PUBG Mobile. Android users who want the absolutely fastest phone available will want to turn elsewhere, but that’s hardly the appeal of the Galaxy Z Flip. And even if you do prize performance, the Z Flip is no slouch. We haven't benchmarked the Galaxy Z Flip 5G yet, but we'd expect its performance to outshine the original Flip and to behave more like the Galaxy Z Fold 2, though that phone boasts more RAM.Inside the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is a 3,300-mAh battery, a respectable size for a foldable where there’s not a lot of room to spare. Consider that the Razr uses a tiny 2,510-mAh power pack and its battery life suffered as a consequence: Motorola’s phone lasted only 6 hours and 4 minutes on our demanding battery test, which involves continuous surfing over LTE until a fully charged phone runs out of power.The Galaxy Z Flip fared better than that, though you won’t mistake this for a long-lasting phone. Over the course of four different battery tests, the Galaxy Z Flip lasted an average of 8 hours and 16 minutes. That’s two hours better than Motorola’s foldable phone but more than 90 minutes less than the average for a smartphone. The Galaxy Fold was able to last 10 hours, though  -- its 4,380 mAh battery is much larger than what you get with the Galaxy Z Flip.Like other recent Samsung flagships, the Galaxy Z Flip supports Wireless PowerShare, meaning you'll be able to wirelessly charge other Qi-compatible devices with this phone. The Galaxy Z Flip also supports fast charging, though ""fast"" is a relative term in this case. After a half-hour of charging a drained Z Flip, the phone’s battery indicator was back up to 43%. We got to 55% with the Galaxy S20 Plus in the same time frame, though that phone comes with a 25-watt charger to the 15-watt charger that the Galaxy Z Flip uses.Thanks to Android 10 and its support for foldable devices, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip offers multitasking through a Multi-Active Window feature. You'll be able to select the apps you want to use on different parts of the screen, though that feature only works with select apps. You’re limited to two apps at once as opposed to the three you can use on the Galaxy Fold, but that makes sense given the dimension of the displays on the different foldables.Multitasking on the Galaxy Z Flip is simply a matter of swiping right from the side of the screen to bring up a tray of apps that support the feature. I was able to watch YouTube videos in one panel on the Z Flip screen while browsing through mail on the other. Some apps work better than others with the Multi-Active Window feature. I wouldn’t advise playing PUBG Mobile while running another app in a different window, though you could in theory. The feature works whether you’re holding your phone in portrait or landscape mode.It didn’t take long a lot of testing for our Samsung Galaxy Z Flip review to realize that Samsung had built the most polished foldable phone yet — at least until the Galaxy Z Fold 2's subsequent release. Even though the new Fold now sets the standard for foldable devices, the Galaxy Z Flip remains a well-built phone that provides a big, colorful screen still capable of folding into a device that fits neatly into your pocket. Features like Flex Mode that take advantage of the Z Flip’s screen mean that foldable devices are more than just gimmicks, though Flex Mode would be even more useful if more apps took advantage of the feature.That doesn’t mean the Galaxy Z Flip is ready to go toe-to-toe with the leading flagships. For starters, those phones may be pricey, but with the exception of the Galaxy S20 Ultra, they’re still cheaper than the Galaxy Z Flip. And while the Z Flip’s cameras certainly produce pictures that match up well with what you’d get from the best camera phones, you’d expect a little something more for a phone that will set you back $1,200 to $1,300, even after Samsung's price cuts. (There's also the possibility of a new Galaxy Z Flip coming out later this year, which might make you wary of springing for an older foldable phone.)So yes, the Galaxy Flip Z is among the best foldable phones you can buy. That’s not enough to make it an alternative to something like the iPhone 12 Pro Max or Galaxy S21 Plus, but the advances Samsung made with this device over the Galaxy Fold makes us think that foldable phones actually have a future.Editor Adam Ismail contributed to this review."
68,Samsung Galaxy Note 20,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-20,"Price: $999 OS: Android 10 with One UI 2.5 Display: 6.7-inch AMOLED (2400x1080; 60Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 865 Plus RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB; not expandable Rear camera: Triple-lens: 12MP wide (ƒ/1.8); 64MP telephoto with 3x lossless zoom (ƒ/1.8); 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2) Front camera: 10MP (ƒ/2.2) Battery: 4,300 mAh Size: 6.36 x 2.96 x 0.32 inches Weight: 6.77 ouncesIt’s easy to forget about the Samsung Galaxy Note 20. Oh, sure — the $1,299 Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is impossible to overlook, with its 6.9-inch adaptive 120Hz display, meticulous glass-and-metal design and absurd triple-camera bump. But the regular Note 20 has none of those things, leading some to dismiss it — perhaps unfairly — as a cut-rate afterthought in Samsung’s roster of premium handsets.Let it be known I was among those guilty of writing off the Note 20 when it was unveiled. However, while the $999 Note 20 offers fewer of those head-turning features than its pricier sibling, it’s appropriately less expensive as well, by $300.That’s not a small chunk of change these days. And ultimately, if you’re buying one of Samsung’s new Notes to get things done more efficiently, the cheaper Note 20 gives up nothing on the Ultra. You still get the same powerful Snapdragon 865 processor, versatile S Pen and Samsung’s latest and greatest productivity-minded software, from the new Notes app to wireless DeX Mode projection.If you absolutely need the best camera and display in your phone, the Note 20 Ultra is waiting for you. But if you don’t mind sacrificing on those fronts to get the same great workhorse for less, there is absolutely nothing cut rate about the regular Note 20 except its price.Continue on in our Samsung Galaxy Note 20 review to find out why this is one of the best phones you can buy today.The Galaxy Note 20 costs $999 and only comes in one configuration, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of non-expandable storage. For reference, the Note 20 Ultra, which packs expandable storage as well as a larger display and battery, among other features, starts at $1,299.The regular Note 20 originally appeared in three colors: Mystic Bronze, Mystic Green and Mystic Gray; at the end of November, Samsung added a new Mystic Red option. This device supports 5G, and you can buy it through any major carrier or unlocked to take it to the network of your choice.Let’s get this out of the way first: Yes, the Galaxy Note 20 has a plastic back instead of a glass one. No, it doesn’t matter.Samsung has done a great job of emulating the fit, finish and appearance of matte glass with the Note 20’s matte plastic, which the company dubs “reinforced polycarbonate.” In fact, the only way you’d be able to tell it isn’t glass is by tapping it with your fingernail — the resulting sound is softer and more hollow, as it tends to be with plastic.Nevertheless, you can rest assured that nothing about the material Samsung has chosen for this model looks or feels flimsy or cheap. In fact, it only benefits the Note 20’s durability, as plastic certainly won’t shatter like even the finest Gorilla Glass does. Samsung also claims the Note 20’s material is less prone to fingerprints than glass tends to be, which definitely held true in my experience.Amidst the concerns over the use of plastic, it’s worth confirming that the Note 20’s frame is still made of chromed metal, trimmed with brushed edges along the top and bottom that add yet more class to the whole affair. That keeps this phablet’s rigidity in check, while also complementing the frosted sheen of the back very well. Truth be told I expected to be underwhelmed by this phone’s design; I’m pleased to report that hasn’t been the case.As for the rest of the Galaxy Note 20, the bezels encircling the screen are scant as can be, yet the glass shrouding the panel is flat. That might sound less luxurious than the Note 20 Ultra’s curved display, but it actually diminishes the likelihood of unintentional taps.Despite the Note 20’s big 6.4-inch screen, this phone doesn’t feel any heavier than the 5.8-inch iPhone 11 Pro I usually carry around, even if the spec sheet tells me it’s a tenth of an ounce heavier than Apple’s flagship. I tend to gravitate toward smaller phones, and at 2.9 inches tall — a hair taller than the Galaxy S20 Plus — the Note 20 about reaches the limit of what I could conceivably live with.Like all Samsung’s recent high-end phones, the Galaxy Note 20 is rated IP68 water resistant. That’s always impressive to me, considering the massive openings these phones have to house the S Pen.It’s hard not to be a little underwhelmed by the Galaxy Note 20’s display, at least on paper. This 6.7-inch 2400 x 1080 panel has but a conventional 60Hz refresh rate, which is disappointing considering you can find 90Hz screens in devices that cost as little as half what the Note 20 does, like the OnePlus Nord.Alas, the cheaper of Samsung’s new phablets can still dazzle with impressive color, contrast and brightness, even if the animations aren’t as smooth as you’d expect from a modern $999 device.The trailer for the bleak new Batman film presented a brilliant showcase for the Note 20’s impressive dynamic range, as explosions, gunfire and street lights shone through a desolate and dim Gotham City. Say what you want about Robert Pattinson’s “emo” take on the caped crusader, but something tells me Batman's new look will pair excellently with the perfectly-inky blacks of the Note 20’s AMOLED panel.This display might not move as swiftly as others, but it does react quicker to S Pen inputs than the Galaxy Note 10 did. Samsung has shortened up latency between the screen and stylus to 26ms, which makes for a 40% improvement over the outgoing model. Unfortunately it’s still a ways off from the Note 20 Ultra’s near instantaneous 9ms response rate, though.Under our light meter, the Note 20 was able to render 122.8% of the sRGB color space in its Natural configuration, as well as a Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.22. That’s damn near identical to the Note 20 Ultra, which achieved 121.5% and 0.24 in both tests, respectively — indicating the quality of onscreen hues will be more or less the same even if you opt for the less expensive device.Sadly, we can’t say the same rings true for brightness. The Note 20 topped out at just 587 nits in our full-screen brightness test, compared to the 662 nits of the Note 20 Ultra and 752 nits of the iPhone 11 Pro Max. These days, the finest OLED panels can routinely top 700 nits, so the regular Note 20 unfortunately presents a slight step backward in this regard.While the Galaxy Note 20 lacks the 108-megapixel primary sensor and 50x Space Zoom capability of the pricier Note 20 Ultra, its triple-lens camera stack still produces excellent results all around.Most of the time, you’ll be shooting with the Note 20’s ƒ/1.8, 12MP main lens. That camera is flanked by a 64MP telephoto with 3x lossless zoom (not optical zoom, mind you — it’s just a sensor crop) as well as another 12MP optic for ultrawide shots.Even despite the Note 20’s deficiencies on paper compared to the Ultra, this is still a supremely capable mobile camera that routinely equals — if not betters — the iPhone 11 Pro in several side-by-side comparisons. Looking at this first example, showing off an idyllic river scene, it’s honestly hard for me to choose a favorite. The contrast and verdant greens in the Note 20’s shot are more captivating, but the iPhone handles the color of the sky better. The perfect photo would comprise elements of both.As dusk set in, I captured this pair of images near an overpass. Samsung’s algorithms are clearly more aggressive in brightening darker hues in scenes, yet the Note 20’s attempt has more obvious contrast as well, particularly within the shadows of the tall grass at the bottom left. Ultimately, I prefer everything about the Galaxy’s attempt, again save for the sky and cloud above, which the iPhone once again captures with more depth, realism and nuance.This comparison, taken from within a covered bridge on a sunny day, was particularly challenging for both devices. It requires each device to expose for the dim conditions inside the bridge, without blowing out the intense sunlight at the opening. Comparing both, it’s clear to see the Note 20 handled this task better — you can suss out some of the trees past the threshold, and pick out more detail in the wooden floorboards all the way to the bridge’s end. The iPhone is unable to navigate this photographic minefield as well.Using both phones’ telephoto lenses, I snapped a pair of images of a flower. It may be hard to see in the slider above, but the iPhone retains more sharpness and detail than the Note 20 here, and also is less susceptible to blowing out the highlights on the petals. Each image is very, very good, but Apple’s rendition is a hair better.On the flip side, the Note 20 becomes the vastly better camera when zooming in from afar. Apple’s digital zoom still doesn’t incorporate demosaicing algorithms, like you see in many Android devices today, including Samsung’s latest flagships. (This is the same technique that gives Google’s Pixels their Super Res Zoom.) Using clever software, the Note 20 is able to reconstruct images in a way that makes digital zoom far sharper than it would be normally, allowing it to capture a cleaner, crisper and less noisy picture of this flag amidst a sea of cornfields at 10x power. In fact, the Note 20 can get all the way up to 30x if you let it.Apple’s Night Mode is typically our favorite of all modern phone makers’ low-light shooting modes, but the Note 20 surprisingly topped the iPhone’s best efforts here. The image from Samsung’s phablet is sharper and less grainy, with more gradation in color, especially looking at the tree to the right and the lawn below. Apple’s software glosses over everything in sepia tones, producing a roundly blurrier and less precise result.To test out how these phones handle shallow depth-of-field portraits, I captured a couple of selfies — only to find that I’m not going to be posting my mug to social media from the Note 20’s 10MP front-facing camera anytime soon. Samsung still hasn’t totally figured out how to properly render people’s skin tones without producing ghostly consequences, even when I turned off all the face beautifying and smoothing features. It’s the Note 20’s only glaring photography-related drawback.While the S Pen itself hasn’t changed much since last year’s Note, what you can do with it has. That’s thanks to the new One UI 2.5 update to Samsung’s Android front end.The most obvious addition in One UI 2.5 is Air Action navigation. While holding the S Pen out in front of the Note 20, you can press down the button on the stylus while moving in an upside down V-shaped motion to return home. Do this in a left or right motion, and you’ll call up recent apps or move backward. Zig zag downward to capture a screenshot.I suspect Air Actions won’t be all that useful to users who choose to stick with classic three-button navigation, but it is convenient if you have your Note 20 set to Android’s gestural bar system, and you’ve got the S Pen in hand.One of the Note 20’s best and newest S Pen-related features is the ability to append audio recordings to written or typed notes. Granted, this feature can be a little difficult to figure out how to use the first time out — you have to tap the paperclip icon in the upper right corner, tap voice recordings and then start capturing audio as you jot down a note, rather than before or after. Then, when you go to play that audio back, the Note 20 will highlight aspects of the text in real time that were added during that particular point of recording. It’s a neat and obviously useful feature for anyone taking notes in a meeting or during a lecture, though like most of the clever S Pen features, I wish Samsung made it a bit easier for newcomers to find.Samsung says it’s punched up its handwriting-to-text transcription in the Note 20 series. To me, this was never an area of great concern — I found the transcription in previous Note devices to be just fine, and the same is true in the Note 20’s case. Personally, I prefer transcription as opposed to handwriting directly within pages, as it keeps things more organized and allows you to fit more on screen, so I appreciate the effort Samsung continues to put into this aspect of the Note experience.One more update to discuss related to the Notes app — it is now built to sync to the cloud and be accessible from any device, whether that’s another Samsung phone or tablet, or your PC. Unfortunately however, the desktop Samsung Notes app is only available for Samsung PCs, which certainly limits its impact. Syncing to Microsoft OneNote is also supported, though only in one direction, from Samsung Notes to OneNote.One UI 2.5 is launching on the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra, though it won’t remain exclusive to Samsung’s latest phablets for long. You can expect many of these features to drop on the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series as well, where applicable, once One UI 2.5 rolls out to them. That’s great news for existing Samsung owners, though it hardly makes a good case for upgrading to the Note 20 if you already have one of those recent handsets.Armed with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 Plus, the Galaxy Note 20 tears through any and all tasks, from running demanding games to taking notes while streaming YouTube or music from Spotify. It’ll surely finish as one of 2020’s most powerful Android phones when all is said and done, even if 2021 is already starting off strong.Playing arcade racer Asphalt 9 on the Note 20 was a somewhat eye-opening experience. I’m accustomed to encountering some dropped frames and stuttering here and there with this title, even on the most powerful Android phones. However, the 865 Plus’ overclocked GPU delivers buttery-smooth gameplay, making the Note 20 a suitable device for gaming (so long as you’re not dismayed by the ordinary refresh rate.)There have been reports of some Galaxy Note 20 Ultra models getting too hot, too quickly, due to differences in the heat management system on a per-device basis. I am not sure what’s inside our particular Note 20 (for what it’s worth, we bought it ourselves rather than use a Samsung-provided review unit), but it didn’t get unreasonably toasty in my experience. Using turn-by-turn navigation, streaming a YouTube video and running Live Caption concurrently at full brightness did cause the back to warm up a bit, though that’s true of pretty much any phone.Turning to benchmarks, the Note 20 totaled 3,182 points on the multi-core portion of the system-wide Geekbench 5 assessment — a shade behind the Note 20 Ultra’s 3,294 result, likely explained by the regular Note 20’s 8GB of RAM to the pricier model’s 12GB. This is very good, though it’s worth pointing out the year-old iPhone 11 Pro Max still beats all Android phones, hitting 3,500 points thanks to Apple’s blazing-fast A13 Bionic silicon. And we did our Note 20 testing before the iPhone 12 came out — the A14 Bionic iPhone 12 Pro Max expands the performance gap even further by posting a multi-core score of 4,111 on Geekbench 5.In terms of graphical performance, the Note 20 achieved 22 frames per second and 1,446 frames in total in GFXBench’s Vulkan-based Aztec Ruins test for high-tier devices. That’s slightly faster than the OnePlus 8 Pro (20 fps; 1,313 frames) but a shade behind the iPhone 11 Pro Max once again (25 fps; 1,657 frames).The Note 20 is about as fast as phones get these days, though there is one frustrating sticking point concerning its specs. This device only comes with 128GB of built-in storage, and there’s no microSD slot for expandability. That’s a bitter compromise for buyers of the cheaper Note, and certainly a reason to consider the Ultra variant, which offers more optional storage as well as microSD support.Finally, a word on the Note 20’s 5G connectivity. This phone is compatible with long-range sub-6GHz 5G networks as well as faster but more range-limited millimeter-wave (mmWave) infrastructure. That certainly bodes well for the Note 20 in terms of future-proofing, though, we weren’t able to track down either signal during our time with the device. And even if we had, we wouldn’t anticipate impressive results, as sub-6GHz 5G continues to underperform based on the latest nationwide testing, while mmWave 5G is very fast but strictly limited to densely-packed cities and line-of-sight access.The Galaxy Note 20 is one of a small number of phones — one of the only others being the upcoming Microsoft Surface Duo — capable of connecting to Windows PCs, allowing you to view and act upon notifications, respond to text messages and even see and interact with your Note’s screen from your computer.The Your Phone app is rich with features that iPhone and Mac users have been enjoying for years, like the ability to make and receive calls without leaving your desktop. The integration is solid and easy to get up and running once you’ve accepted the flurry of notifications Windows requires to dig its hooks into your Note 20.It’s generally impressive, though Your Phone begins to fall short when you attempt to interact directly with your Note’s display via Windows. I’ll admit that “swiping” around Android on your PC’s monitor with your mouse is a somewhat bewildering experience the very first time you do it, though that amazement quickly comes crashing down to Earth once you take stock of the blemishes.For starters, the stream from the Note 20 can be remarkably low resolution — so much so that it’s hard to read elements on screen to click on. Animations often play back at less than half speed, and the entire affair was so slow and muddy when I tried it that I can’t imagine returning to it anytime soon. The culprit could be my local connection of course, though I suspect there’s a reason Apple doesn’t fuss with phone-to-PC wireless mirroring — it’s simply too laggy and prone to hiccups too much of the time.The Note 20 can also cast its desktop-class DeX Mode wirelessly to Miracast-supported displays. That’s a new feature for DeX; previously, you needed a cable to either project it via a TV or PC.Unfortunately, I couldn’t get wireless DeX Mode up and running on my Samsung Q-series TV. (This seemed to be more of a problem with the TV than the Note, which refused to let me allow the phone to connect to it.) However, my colleague Mark noted in his Galaxy Note 20 Ultra review that DeX works well enough over Miracast, even if the overall experience isn’t quite as smooth and instantaneous as using the Note directly.Gamers will appreciate that the Note 20 is supported as part of Microsoft’s $15-per-month Xbox Game Pass Beta program, allowing you to stream Xbox and PC titles to your phone. More than 100 titles are included in the initial run, from Gears 5 to Forza Horizon 4 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Eventually, Microsoft will surely extend support to other phones, though the Note 20 models will get in on the ground floor on September 15, when Microsoft flips the switch on Game Pass streaming.While the Galaxy Note 20 concedes more than a few desirable features to the Note 20 Ultra, battery capacity thankfully isn’t one of them. This device comes with a 4,300mAh unit, which isn’t far off the Ultra’s 4,500mAh capacity. The Note 20’s battery also charges equally as fast, with the included 25W adapter.The Note 20 lasted an average of 9 hours and 38 minutes in Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where the device cycled through an endless list of web pages while connected to AT&T’s LTE network and set to 150 nits of screen brightness.Compare that to the Note 20 Ultra — which lasted 10:26 on its 60Hz mode, yet only 7:59 on its 120Hz mode — and the regular Note 20 falls unsurprisingly between those extremes. 9:38 is hardly epic though, especially considering the Galaxy S20 Plus notched 10:31 when set to 60Hz, and 2019’s Galaxy Note 10 Plus delivered 10:47.Longevity on a charge should have been the one upside to the regular Note 20’s 60 Hz display, though it hasn’t seemed to help much. Still, at least the phone recharges quickly enough, taking 30 minutes to reach 55% from completely dead. Additionally, the Note 20 supports 15-watt fast wireless charging as well as the ability to wirelessly charge other devices with Samsung’s PowerShare feature. That’s something iPhones still can’t claim.The best thing about the Galaxy Note 20 is that it does pretty much everything well. It’s very powerful, excels at productivity and note taking, and sports a pretty (if not entirely cutting-edge) display and design. It’s the complete package.What it’s missing is that wow factor — something Note 20 Ultra has in spades, between its 120Hz screen, crazy cameras and daunting size. However, I’m not so sure that’s such a bad thing. Tech aficionados and early adopters can empty their pockets for the Ultra, and I suspect they won't be disappointed. However, other buyers drawn to the Note primarily because of the value of the S Pen as a practical tool can get exactly what they want, less some arguably frivolous bells and whistles in the regular Note 20, and save $300 in the process. The only things they stand to lose are storage and a bit of battery life.Before embarking on this Galaxy Note 20 review, I struggled to pin down who the Note 20 was for, but now I’ve figured it out. If you want to be dazzled with the absolute pinnacle of mobile technology, buy the Note 20 Ultra. But if all you really care about is getting stuff done, the regular Note 20 is here to the rescue."
69,OnePlus 8 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-8-pro,"The OnePlus 8 Pro is a much better deal now than when it first launched. For $799 (down from $899), you get premium craftsmanship, and eye-popping 6.78-inch display (with 120Hz refresh rate)  quad cameras and 5G capability. The OnePlus 8 Pro also offers wireless charging — finally! — and it’s the fastest wireless charging we’ve ever tested. Is the OnePlus 8 Pro flawless? Nope. The otherwise stunning curved display led to several accidental taps during my OnePlus 8 Pro review. And while the OnePlus 8 Pro’s cameras are certainly capable, they’re not best in class.Price: $799/£799 OS: Android 10 with OxygenOS Display: 6.78 inches OLED (3168 x 1440), 120Hz CPU: Snapdragon 865 RAM: 8GB, 12GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 48MP wide (f/1.78), 8MP telephoto (3x, f/2.44), 48MP ultra-wide (f/2.2), 5MP color filter (f/2.4) Front camera: 16MP (f/2.45) Battery: 4,510 mAh 5G: Sub 6-GHz Size: 6.5 x 2.9 x 0.33 Weight: 7 ouncesSome may prefer the cheaper OnePlus 8, which now costs $599 and is sold through T-Mobile and Verizon — the OnePlus 8 Pro is only sold unlocked. But the OnePlus 8 Pro is a better phone all around, with a smoother display, wireless charging and better cameras.Overall, the newer Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus looks like a better option because it offers a dynamic 120Hz display along with more advanced cameras. And some may simply want to wait for the OnePlus 9 this spring. But the OnePlus 8 Pro is a very good Android phone and it still makes our best phones list. The OnePlus 8 Pro now starts at $799 or £799 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. At the time of this writing, OnePlus does not offer the 8GB/128GB version. But overall that's a good price for that much storage. The OnePlus Nord is not sold through U.S. carriers, but you can still buy it directly from OnePlus through the OnePlus U.S. website and the OnePlus UK website. Samsung could learn something from the OnePlus 8 Pro’s design. It’s gorgeous without being a fingerprint magnet. The OnePlus 8 Pro uses matte-frosted glass using a new crafting process. The finish is smooth to the touch but not slippery, and there’s a visible sheen to the back of the phone that changes shades depending on how ambient light hits it. The OnePlus 8 Pro comes in three colors: Onyx Black, Glacial Green and Ultramarine Blue. I tested the Ultramarine Blue model, which really pops but might be a bit loud for some. The Glacial Green color is more subtle but more vibrant than the Midnight Green hue on the iPhone 11 Pro.There’s more good news. The OnePlus 8 Pro is IP68 rated, which makes this the first OnePlus phone to have that level of water resistance. That means the phone can survive being submerged in 1.5 meters (5 feet) of water for 30 minutes, thus earning it a spot on our list of the best waterproof phones. I do have some complaints about the OnePlus 8 Pro’s design. The first is that the curved screen is too curved for me. On multiple occasions I pressed something I didn’t intend to; for example, I would be in the Google Play Store and my left pinky wrapped around the phone would open an app I didn’t mean to select. And on other occasions, I thought that the OnePlus 8 Pro wasn’t registering my taps, but it turned out that my other hand was touching the screen.My other issue is that the rear vertical camera bump protrudes more from the back of the OnePlus 8 Pro than the camera patches do on the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and iPhone 11 Pro Max.The good news is that the OnePlus 8 Pro is fairly sleek given it’s large 6.78-inch display. It measures 6.5 x 2.9 x 0.33 inches and weighs 7 ounces, compared to 6.37 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches and 6.56 ounces for the Galaxy S20 Plus. So the OnePlus 8 Pro is bigger and taller than the S20 Plus, but that’s understandable given that the Samsung has a smaller 6.7-inch screen. The OnePlus 8 Pro is also lighter than the 7.26-ounce OnePlus 7 Pro, mostly because OnePlus ditched the pop-up selfie camera.The OnePlus 8 Pro possesses one of the best displays I’ve ever tested on a phone, which is saying something given that the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs $200 more and the Galaxy S20 Plus is $400 more. Not only do you get a super smooth 120Hz refresh rate like Samsung’s flagship, but the OnePlus 8 Pro gives you that rate even at its max 2K resolution. With the S20 line, you have to drop down to 1080p resolution if you want the higher 120Hz rate.So how does the OnePlus 8 Pro screen look? Dazzling. When I fired up the Furious 9 trailer, the deep red Pontiac Fiero with a rocket strapped to its roof had plenty of punch, and I could make out fine details in its fortified nose. I watched another scene with the Galaxy S20 side by side with 120Hz mode on, and the OnePlus 8 Pro’s panel looked a little smoother during the most frenetic action sequences, such as when Letty’s (Michelle Rodriguez) motorcycle collides with another car in mid air. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s picture looks so smooth thanks to what’s called MEMC. A dedicated chip upsales videos on Netflix and YouTube from 24 fps up to 120 fps. Amazon videos go up to 60 fps. Another plus is an HDR boosting feature that optimizes every frame, which results in deeper blacks and whiter whites. I did notice that faces were brighter even in darker areas when watching the James Bond No Time to Die trailer on the OnePlus 8 Pro compared to the Galaxy S20. The OnePlus 8 Pro is rated for 1,300 nits of brightness, and it was just as bright outdoors as the iPhone 11 Pro and Galaxy S20 when viewing the Tom’s Guide website. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s display also fared very well in our lab tests. The panel registered 165% of the sRGB color gamut and 116.9% in the more demanding DCI-P3 gamut. By comparison, the Galaxy S20 Plus hit a higher 224% on sRGB and 163.4 on DCI-P3. I did notice more saturated hues on the S20 when watching the same scene on Tiger King on both phones, even with both displays set to vivid mode.The OnePlus 8 Pro does show more accurate colors than the Galaxy S20 Plus. On the Delta-E test, which measures color accuracy, the OnePlus 8 Pro scored 0.26, compared to 0.36 for the Galaxy S20 Plus. A score of 0 is perfect, so lower scores are better. The OnePlus 8 Pro even edged out the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s score of 0.28. The OnePlus 8 Pro is a remarkably capable camera phone and holds its own with the best camera phones in some scenarios. However, while the low-light results were particularly impressive, the OnePlus 8 Pro struggled a bit versus the competition with portraits and close-ups.The OnePlus 8 Pro packs four rear cameras, including a 48-megapixel main camera with an f/1.78 aperture that will let you shoot at 48MP or 12MP. The 48MP mode is best for when you have a lot of ambient light. There’s also a 8MP telephoto camera with a 3x optical zoom, and ultra-wide 48MP camera with a 119-degree field of view and a dedicated 5MP color filter camera that lets you apply artistic filters as you’re shooting.As you can see in this photo of a nearly empty Times Square, the OnePlus 8 Pro does a fine job capturing the surrounding billboards without blowing out the sunny sky. You can make out details in the clouds as well as in the surrounding signs.To test out the 48MP camera mode, I captured a photo of some Easter decorations and spring flowers at the Twin Pond Farms country market in Howell, NJ. The 48MP photo delivered crisper details across the board, including in the bunnies’ faces and their straw arms. Plus, you have a lot more freedom with this amount of detail to crop in vs 12MP mode.I put the OnePlus 8 Pro’s camera up against the Galaxy S20 Pro in this photo of a stream at a NJ park. The Galaxy S20 delivers more vibrant colors, especially in the grass, and it’s a warmer photo overall, but the OnePlus 8 Pro’s shot offers more true-to-life colors and more detail when you zoom in, especially on the left side of the image underneath the trees.The OnePlus 8 Pro fell a bit flat versus the iPhone 11 Pro Max in this portrait comparison. While the bokeh effect is convincing with the blurred flowering tree in the background, there’s overall image is hazier than the iPhone 11 Pro’s shot. You can also make out a lot more detail in my green jacket in the iPhone 11 Pro portrait. Another bummer: you can’t adjust the level of blur after the fact as you can on the Galaxy S20.To test out the 3x optical zoom on the OnePlus 8 Pro, I snapped this photo of a colorful baseball dugout with it and the Galaxy S20. Here I give Samsung’s phone a slight edge; the “Go Freehold” text is easier to read, and the orange, purple, pink and blue in the painting are more vibrant than on the OnePlus 8 Pro. Still, the details are about as sharp in both photos.To test the OnePlus 8 Pro’s Nightscape mode, I snapped a photo of a candle in almost complete darkness. And this phone did a much better job capturing the wick and flame than the iPhone 11 Pro Max did; they got blown out in the latter pic. However, the iPhone managed to deliver a brighter overall image, as it’s easier to make out the runner on the table.How about close-ups? The OnePlus 8 Pro struggled in this shot of flowers. The center of the frame is in focus, but the surrounding flowers get blurred in with the rest of the tree. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S20’s shot delivers a brighter white in the flowers and more detail in the petals.As for the color filter camera, I don’t know if it really needs to exist. You can apply similar effects after you shoot on most camera phones. The choices on the OnePlus Pro 8 range from matte and vivid to black and white. But the most appealing — and strange — color filter is Photochrom. This usually refers to a process of producing colorized images from black-and-white photographic negatives. As you can see in this example, Photochrom takes a green tree and grass and turns them into an odd cream color. It makes my neighborhood look like it’s experiencing a nuclear winter. The same mode made me see what my living room couch would look like if it changed from dark gray to cream.The 16MP front camera on the OnePlus 8 Pro snaps satisfying selfies, especially compared to the Galaxy S20. While Samsung’s phone has a tendency to overly smooth faces and wash them out, the OnePlus 8 Pro delivered a more realistic portrait. Yes, the wrinkles around my eyes and in my forehead are more visible, but I also appreciate the warmer skin tone and more detail in my hair that the OnePlus 8 Pro offered. As you would expect the OnePlus 8 Pro packs the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip to deliver blazing performance, and it’s paired with LPDDR5 RAM, which is designed to boost memory speeds by 30% while lowering power consumption by 20%. In addition, OnePlus includes a RAM booster for accelerating gaming and speeding up daily performance by learning your usage of the device.Overall, I was impressed with the OnePlus 8 Pro’s speed. I enjoyed silky smooth performance when playing Call of Duty; even with multiple enemies on screen I didn’t experience lag. And the Asphalt 9 racing game felt almost too fast as I flipped in the air off some ramps. On Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the OnePlus 8 Pro scored 3,379 on the multi-core portion of the test and 906 on single-core. Both of those numbers beat the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus (3,076/818). The iPhone 11 Pro Max trumped both phones with multi- and single-core results of 3,517 and 1,334.The OnePlus 8 Pro was only slightly behind the Galaxy S20 on the GFXBench graphics benchmark. When we ran the 1440p Atzec Ruins OpenGL (high tier) offscreen test, the OnePlus 8 Pro delivered 20 fps, compared to 21 fps for the Samsung.However, the OnePlus 8 Pro fell behind the Galaxy S20 Plus on our real-world video editing test. Using Adobe Rush to transcode a 4K video to 1080p, it took the OnePlus 8 Pro 1 minute and 43 seconds, compared to 1:14 for the S20 Plus. The iPhone 11 Pro Max beat them all with 45 seconds.The good news is that the OnePlus 8 Pro supports 5G networks. The bad news is that this phone doesn’t support mmWave networks, which means you won’t get the fastest 5G speeds. The phone's X55 5G modem supports sub-6GHz 5G, low and mid band. Only the regular OnePlus 8 sold through Verizon supports mmWave.Using T-Mobile’s 5G network I ran several tests using the Speedtest app, and downloads from the OnePlus 8 Pro ranged from 85 Mbps down to 105 Mbps, which is not blazing but better than my iPhone 11 Pro Max over Verizon 4G LTE (65 Mbps down). The OnePlus 8 Pro’s upload speeds did not impress, averaging 11 Mbps.The OnePlus 8 Pro packs a 4,510 mAh battery, which is slightly bigger than the 4,500 mAh battery in the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus. And this phone delivered impressive endurance in our battery test, which involved continuous web surfing over 5G on 150 nits of screen brightness. The OnePlus 8 Pro lasted an excellent 11 hours and 5 minutes with the display set to 60 Hz. That runtime bests the Galaxy S20 Plus by about a half hour, as Samsung’s phone lasted 10:31.Putting the phone into 120Hz mode did take a toll on battery life, as the OnePlus 8 Pro lasted only 9 hours and 2 minutes. Still, this result also bests the Galaxy S20 Plus (8:55). Note that we ran our battery test on full HD resolution and not quad HD, but we will update this review once we’ve run another series of tests.The OnePlus 8 Pro isn’t just the first OnePlus phone to offer wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. It’s officially the fastest wireless charging phone in the world.Thanks to a special Warp Charge 30 Wireless charger, available for $65, you can juice the OnePlus 8 Pro faster than any standard Qi wireless charger for iPhones or Android phones. For example, Samsung’s fast wireless charger for the Galaxy S20 charges at 15 watts; the Warp Charge 30 wireless doubles that power.In our testing, the OnePlus 8 Pro charged to 55 percent in just 30 minutes, which is how long the iPhone 11 Pro takes to fast charge with its fast wired charger. In order to prevent overheating, the Warp Charge 30 wireless has its own built-in fan; you can hear it, but it’s not distractingly loud. The only bummer is that the wireless charger doesn’t work with the phone in landscape mode, unlike several third-party chargers.The included wired charger is even faster, as it took the OnePlus 8 Pro from 0 percent to 63% in 30 minutes and to 34% power in 15 minutes.OnePlus’ OxygenOS does not have a lot of new features to speak of, but it adds some welcome goodies on top of Android 10. This includes an improved universal dark mode that’s now compatible with more apps and fun dynamic wallpapers that subtly shift color tones based on the outdoor temperature. OnePlus gives you two ways to unlock the OnePlus 8 Pro: an in-screen fingerprint scanner and face unlock. I found the fingerprint scanner to be pretty quick, so long as you’re deliberate with the press. But Face Unlock is even quicker on this phone, and I can see most people opting for that first. Just keep in mind that your fingerprint or PIN is more secure, because OnePlus' 2D Face Unlock isn't as sophisticated as the 3D facial recognition in the iPhone 11 and Pixel 4.If you’re trying to decide between the OnePlus 8 Pro and the OnePlus 8, check out our OnePlus 8 vs OnePlus 8 Pro face-off. But there’s the gist. The OnePlus 8 Pro gives you a bigger display with a faster refresh rate (6.78 inches and 120Hz vs 6.55 inches and 90 Hz), a 3x telephoto camera, wireless charging and faster RAM. Plus, only the OnePlus 8 Pro is IP68 water resistant. However, the regular OnePlus 8 benefits from being cheaper at $699 vs $899 for the OnePlus Pro, and only the OnePlus 8 is sold through wireless carriers in T-Mobile and Verizon. And the Verizon OnePlus 8 Pro supports mmWave 5G, which the OnePlus 8 Pro doesn’t have.The OnePlus 8 Pro is now a better value thanks to the price reduction by OnePlus. And you get a lot for your money, including a 120Hz mode that doesn’t force you to choose between a fast refresh rate and the highest resolution and long battery life. Plus, the OnePlus 8 Pro offers the fastest wireless charging around. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s cameras are not the best in its class, and I wish OnePlus went with a flat display instead of a curved one, but overall the OnePlus 8 Pro is still one of the better Android phones you can buy. I would just keep an eye out for the upcoming OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro if you want the fastest speeds and even better cameras."
70,Oppo Reno4 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oppo-reno4-pro,"Price: £699 OS: Android 10 with ColorOS 7 Display: 6.55-inch AMOLED (2400 x 1080), 90Hz Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB Rear cameras: 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide, 13MP telephoto (2x optical, 5x hybrid, 20x digital), laser autofocus Front camera: 32MP Battery size: 4,000 mAh Charging speed: 65W wired Size: 2.85 x 6.28 x 0.29 inches (72.5mm x 159.6mm x 7.6mm) Weight: 6.06 ounces (172 grams) Water/dust resistance: UnratedOppo’s Reno4 Pro may have debuted in China over the summer, but it’s only now reaching the U.K. It arrives in a crowded field of phones, all trying to make their mark while keeping prices under control.In some ways, the Reno4 Pro does a good job at that. It's a smartly designed phone, with some stand-out elements like 65W charging and a good display/speaker offering. However it stumbles a little when it comes to photography and some of its older components. Our Oppo Reno4 Pro review finds a phone that doesn’t benefit from its late arrival. With so many other phones already doing a similar job there aren't many reasons why you'd pick a Reno4 specifically over a Google Pixel 5 or a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE.In the U.K. the £699 Oppo Reno4 Pro is currently available from Oppo itself, as well as retailers like Amazon and Carphone Warehouse or phone carriers like EE or Vodafone. There's only one model you can buy, with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, but there's a choice of Space Black or Galactic Blue with the £699 version. A unique Green Glitter version available only from Oppo costs an extra £50.Oppo doesn't sell its phones yet in the U.S. If you're interested in this handset, you can likely import it at a small markup. Just remember to make sure the device supports the correct 4G and 5G bands for your mobile carrier, otherwise it'll be almost useless as a phone.Unpacking the Reno4 from its oddly large box, you can immediately see the resemblance it has to its stablemate, the OnePlus 8T. (The same parent company owns both Oppo and OnePlus.) The front camera punch-hole is in the same spot in the top left corner on both phones, and the buttons on the sides are in the same location too, although Oppo hasn't copied OnePlus' handy iPhone-style alert slider. Another big difference is the curve of the Reno4 Pro's display — it’s not dramatic, but it does help the Reno4 Pro stand out and fit nicely in your hand without making you worry about accidentally tapping the screen.The back of the Reno4 Pro curves into the flat side rail, making for a neat elliptical cross-section. The back itself is quite special though, since the Galactic Blue model has a dark diagonal streak of color baked across the center of the phone, as well as having a slightly glittery smudge-proof matte finish. Combined with the mirror finish on the rounded rectangular camera bump in the top left corner, there's a lot to take in for a phone that otherwise is quite plain on its reverse. I like how unique the Reno4 looks, but I'd understand if someone else thought this mix of colors and finishes looked cluttered.The Reno4 is a comfortable phone to hold despite the large 6.5-inch display. The slightly rounded design is ergonomic, and the matte texture on the back not only gives the phone a unique texture that's pleasant to the touch but helps give a firmer grip.That's handy since this is a phone you really don't want to subject to the elements. Oppo hasn't had the Reno4 Pro officially rated for resistance to water and dust. However it promises that the phone's still been thoroughly tested against intrusion, even if there isn't an IP68 rating like the OnePlus 8 Pro or other leading Android phones offer.With a 6.55 inch screen, the Reno4 Pro would be considered a phablet, though not a massively sized one. It matches the measurements of the OnePlus 8T, but is smaller than something like a 6.7-inch Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus.The refresh rate on the Reno4’s display is 90Hz — faster than the average smartphone, but not as fast as the 120Hz refresh rate enjoyed by phones like the Galaxy S20 FE or OnePlus 8T. In theory, 90Hz puts less of a strain on the phone’s battery.The maximum brightness of the Reno4 Pro's AMOLED panel is 1,100 nits. We weren't able to check this with our own measurements, but I could use the Reno4 outdoors in the bright winter sun with no problem.I watched the new trailer for Disney Plus' Loki on the Reno4 Pro’s display and found the nighttime scenes impressively dark, with the phone’s OLED panel offering plenty of detail and color. Trying out a round of the Shadow Arena fighting game proved what a benefit a high refresh rate could be, with the quick kicks, punches and sword swings coming across far clearer on the Oppo's display than it did on 60Hz screens.A display isn't much good without speakers to pair sound with the visuals. The Reno4 Pro offers stereo speakers, which is a solid start to producing good sound. Those speakers have quite a lot of strength behind them too, as I was immediately struck by how loudly the Reno4 could render the trademark bombastic orchestral themes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe during the Loki trailer. While you can find other phones at this price with display features you may prefer— take the Galaxy S20 FE and its 120Hz screen — the Reno4’s combination of sound and visuals ought to please most people.The Reno4 Pro gives you the sensors you expect from a flagship. On the back, there's a 48MP main camera, as well as a 13MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide shooter. As a bonus, there's also a laser autofocus sensor to help out the other cameras.I took the Reno4 Pro out with my trusty iPhone 12 Pro to see how well Oppo's phone could compete with Apple's best. The first test was this view from a bridge over the Regents Canal. Although it’s capable of capturing 48MP pictures, the Oppo takes pictures at 12MP by default using pixel-binning to save space and improve low-light performance.For this comparison, I give the iPhone the edge. I much prefer the more vivid colors that its image offers compared to the more muted ones from the Reno4.I tried an alternative view of the canal at Browning's Pool once night had fallen to test low-light shooting. This seems to be the Reno4's biggest weakness in photography, with its picture turning out muddy in color and far less sharp than the iPhone's image.Comparing the two cameras' ultrawide capabilities is difficult, since they use very different magnifications. Setting aside the extra stuff you can see in the iPhone's image, the other notable change is how much brighter the sky is in comparison to the Reno4's photo. The buildings still look similar though, so I haven't got much of a preference between the two.I tried out the two phones' 2x optical telephoto zoom cameras on this plaque commemorating Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin. The Oppo has a slight resolution advantage with a 13MP sensor, compared to the iPhone's 12MP sensor, but strangely the iPhone's image is far brighter. While there is some charm to the darker image produced by the Reno4, the extra brightness helps the iPhone show off the finer details in the plaque's stonework.To assess the Reno4's laser autofocus, I tried taking a bokeh shot of these flowers, a photo effect that requires both well-written software and the help of either a laser or optical sensor to judge the distances of objects.I like the Reno4's image. The flowers pop out from the background, and the image is nice and bright because of its big 48MP camera. However, I prefer the iPhone's image, with its far more vivid colors. Plus, there's less of an unwanted halo effect around certain portions of the flowers in the iPhone image.For selfies, the Reno4 Pro provides a 32MP camera, a fairly high resolution for a front camera. In contrast, the iPhone 12 Pro has a 12MP camera aided by a depth sensor. Like we saw with the previous bokeh shot, the iPhone produces a more saturated image compared to the Reno4. In addition, it deals with the background better, actually showing off the tree and building behind me rather than overexposing it to almost pure white in some places. Once more, while there's not a huge amount wrong with the Reno4's picture, it's the iPhone's shot I'd pick to go on Instagram.Perhaps it's not a surprise that the top phone on our best camera phones list beat the Oppo Reno4 Pro. However the fact that the Reno4 was able to hold its own at all should be celebrated. Since the Reno is sold in the U.K. for exactly the same price as the cheapest iPhone 12 Mini, and £100 less than the iPhone 12, phone, you can expect photography in the same ballpark as Apple’s best-in-class phones while not spending as much money.Inside the Reno4 Pro, there's a curious mix of parts. The chipset is a Snapdragon 765G, a mid-range processor with built-in 5G, which suits the Reno4's position as Oppo's mid-range phone option, between the phone maker’s A-series and the Find series. However we still get 12GB of RAM, which is just as much as you'd find in a much more expensive Android phone like the Galaxy S20. I played a few rounds of Shadow Fight Arena to test out how the Reno4 Pro handled gaming. This 2D fighter proved to be no challenge for the Reno4, which ably kept up with the action without the phone's chassis heating up excessively or the game losing stability or resolution. Even though I know playing this game on a Snapdragon 865-equipped phone would be a better experience, I didn't feel I was missing out by using the still mighty 765G within the Oppo.To get some more specific performance information, we ran the Geekbench 5 benchmark on the Reno4, which scored 603 on the single-core portion of the test, and 1759 on the multi-score portion. It's quite a lot lower than the OnePlus 8T's scores, which managed 887 and 3,203 with its Snapdragon 865 chip and 12GB RAM. It's not surprising given how Snapdragon 8-series chips are the best that Qualcomm offers to smartphone manufacturers, while 7-series chips like the 765G are designed to offer more everyday levels of performance.The Pixel 5, which uses the same Snapdragon 765G chipset as the Reno4, scored 1,615 on the multi-core part of the test, a lower score potentially due to it only having 8GB RAM to play with. The original OnePlus Nord which also uses a 765G but with the same 12GB of RAM, scored 602 and 1,948 on the same test. While that's obviously a higher multi-core score, it shouldn't mean too big a difference in real-world performance.Expect plenty of power for everyday use with the Oppo Reno4 Pro, but you aren't getting leading performance for the price. Plus, spending a little more will let you get another step higher on the Qualcomm ladder and acquire the most powerful hardware on the market while keeping the premium phone trappings.The 4,000 mAh battery inside the Reno4 Pro isn't particularly large, but it still means there's a decent capacity on offer within the phone's slim frame. We didn't run our normal LTE web browsing-based rundown test to check how long the battery lasts, but as a more casual test of watching an hour of YouTube revealed, the fully-charged Oppo used just 5% of its capacity during that period of time. Since video streaming is quite power-intensive, you shouldn't have any trouble with the Reno4 running out on you in the middle of the day if you're using it for less strenuous tasks like internet browsing or answering your emails and messages.While the Reno4 battery seems somewhat average, what instead stands out on the Reno4 is its 65W wired charging. That’s the same super-fast charging introduced by the OnePlus 8T earlier in the year. The chunky charging brick and extra-thick cable you get in the box offers some of the best charging speeds you can get on a phone right now. You can fill the phone to 63% full in just 15 minutes, and in 35 minutes you can top off the phone's battery completely. Why bother plugging your phone in overnight when you can power up that fast?For comparison, the Galaxy S20 FE comes with a 25W charger, while the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a 5G feature an 18W charger. Even the more expensive iPhone 12 maxes out at 20W (and there’s no charger in the box with Apple’s phone).Disappointingly for a late 2020 phone, you don't get Android 11 out of the box. Instead, you have Android 10 served up as Oppo's ColorOS 7.Android 10 is not a bad operating system, and Oppo promises the Reno4 will get its Android 11 upgrade over the air sometime in 2021. But it certainly would have been nice for Android 11 to come installed already.You get some pre-installed apps on the Reno4, but not enough to really be a problem. This includes Game Space to manage and launch all your mobile games from, an Oppo Relax app for meditation, the Soloop video editing app, Oppo's Phone Clone data transfer app as well as a couple of third party apps — namely Facebook, and WPS Office. Typing on the Reno4 with default settings is extremely unpleasant. The haptic feedback turns every tap of the keyboard into a long buzz, making typing long passages of texts at speed feel horribly mushy. The rest of the phone's haptics are fine, but you will almost certainly want to turn off typing vibrations if you're a quick typer.For security, your main option is an under-display fingerprint sensor. However you can use a less secure but surprisingly quick face unlock feature, too. This is common on many modern Android phones, but unlike the famous Face ID you find on iPhones, it’s not as secure since it works with just an image, rather than infra-red dot projection. Since face recognition works so smoothly and reliably on the Reno4, it doesn't hurt to have it set up, but make sure your fingerprint and PIN are also enabled to fully secure your phone.The best parts of the Reno4 Pro are its most practical ones. The rapid charging and mid-sized design makes this a sensible phone to buy, while its good quality display and audio means you can still enjoy movies and games. Even the areas we found wanting are still not that bad, such as the photography or its computing performance. And with any luck, the issue of older software will disappear in a few months once Oppo sends an OTA update for Android 11.It's unfortunate that the Reno4 didn't hit the U.K. market earlier in the year. If it had arrived shortly after the OnePlus 8, and before we had a summer and fall of strong midrange phones like the OnePlus Nord and Pixel 4a 5G, then Oppo’s phone would have been a standout. Arriving now, though, with the Nord, Pixel 4a and now the OnePlus 8T now available, the Reno4 feels like a phone that missed its time to shine."
71,Motorola One 5G Ace,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-one-5g-ace-review,"The original Motorola One 5G debuted last year as a relatively affordable 5G with a simple problem — apart from its price tag, it really didn't stand out from the growing crowd of more affordable 5G phones. Motorola's response to that challenge? Make the follow-up phone even cheaper.Unfortunately for Motorola and its new Motorola One 5G Ace, the rest of the world hasn't stood still. The Ace may be the least expensive 5G device Motorola has ever sold, but rival phone makers have come out with cheaper 5G devices of their own. While battery life improves dramatically with this version of the Motorola One, this phone still struggles to carve out its own space.Starting price: $399 Screen size: 6.7 inches (2400 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 750 RAM: 4GB, 6GB Storage/Expandable?: 64GB, 128GB/Yes Rear cameras: 48MP (f/1.7) main; 8MP (f/2.2) ultrawide; 2MP (f/2.4) macro Front camera: 16MP (f/2.2) Battery size: 5,000 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 12:03 Size: 6.5 x 3 x 0.39 inches Weight: 7.5 ouncesIn this Motorola One 5G Ace review, we'll look at a phone that's good at a number of things, but not really great at enough of them to make a lasting impression.As with its predecessor, the best thing the Motorola One 5G Ace has going for it is its price — an attractive $399. That's roughly $50 less than what the first Motorola One 5G cost, and it's a $100 discount off the Pixel 4a 5G, which for my money is the best budget 5G phone you can get.Inexpensive as the Motorola One 5G Ace may be, it's not the only 5G device pushing prices lower. The TCL 10 5G UW costs the same and, as a Verizon exclusive reaps the benefits of Big Red's super-fast Ultra Wideband towers. The OnePlus Nord N10 5G just arrived in North America and its lowered the pricing bar even further, down to $299. You almost have to feel bad for Motorola, which just wants to sell people a cheaper 5G device.You can buy the phone unlocked from Motorola's website and Best Buy. Several carriers are set to offer the Motorola One 5G Ace as well, though it doesn't appear to have arrived at any as of this writing.The Motorola One 5G Ace doesn't feel like an inexpensive phone when you hold it, even if that case is noticeably plastic. The Frosted Silver color of my review unit looks pretty stylish, and I'm a fan of the textured pattern on the back of the phone, even if I had to wipe it down regularly to get rid of the fingerprints. I also appreciate that the Motorola One 5G Ace retains a headphone jack, right on the bottom of the phone next to the USB-C charging port.At 6.5 x 3 x 0.39 inches, the Motorola One 5G Ace is on the bulkier side of things for a 5G phone, as it's taller than both the OnePlus Nord N10 5G and TCL 10 5G. That means there's room for a 6.7-inch screen, which is bigger than the display on those other two 5G phones.The screen itself features minimal bezels as Motorola has moved the fingerprint reader to the power button on the Ace's side, and the front camera is housed in a punch-hole cutout at the center of the LCD panel. That leaves a lot of room for enjoying videos, which are display with a reasonable array of colors.In saturated mode, the Motorola One 5G Ace can recreate 128.1% of the sRGB color spectrum, a percentage that drops to 106% when you switch to normal mode. For context, the OnePlus Nord N10 captures 124.8% of the sRGB spectrum, while TCL's 5G phone reproduced 105.1%. Colors weren't as accurate on the Motorola One 5G Ace, which had a Delta-E rating of 0.35 in saturated mode. The OnePlus and TCL phones had ratings of 0.22 and 0.28, respectively. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)None of that affected my viewing of the No Time to Die trailer on YouTube. Other LCD screens sometimes have trouble with the more shadowy sequences in the long unreleased James Bond installment, but I found it easy enough to spot Daniel Craig in the dark.When we measured with a light meter, the Motorola One 5G Ace peaked at 635 nits, which places Motorola's phone in Pixel 4a 5G (638 nits) territory. It's certainly brighter than comparably priced phones like the OnePlus Nord N10 (405.7 nits) and the TCL 10 5G (385 nits).Little's changed with camera optics on the Motorola One 5G Ace, though you won't find the depth sensor that adorned the back of the original Motorola One. Still left over is a 48MP main camera augmented by an 8MP ultrawide lens and a 2MP macro camera. (That's also a step back from the 5MP macro lens on the first Motorola One 5G.)These cameras aren't going to challenge the best camera phones out there, but they produce some solid shots, and a few of the photos in my testing stand up well to the competition. Unfortunately for Motorola, we're living in an era where the Pixel 4a and Pixel 4a 5G both offer outstanding cameras for $349 and $499, respectively, so a $399 phone that takes merely adequate pictures isn't going to set hearts aflame.Take this shot of a plate of lasagna, which is too cool in the Motorola One 5G Ace's rendition. The wood grain on the table is washed out, the green broccolini is dull, and you'd be hard-pressed to guess if I was drinking a glass of merlot or Pennzoil. The warmer colors captured by the OnePlus Nord N10 5G make for a much more appetizing meal and a more attractive image.Things got better when I moved outside to take a photo of a camellia tree in my backyard. The Ace has darkened the white garage wall behind the tree a bit more than the OnePlus did, but otherwise, there's little separating these two photos. The camellia flowers themselves are a bright, pinkish red, suggesting to me that the Motorola One 5G Ace's cameras do just fine when given enough natural light.Pulling back to test the ultrawide lens, I like the composition of the Motorola shot. It seems more in focus around the edges than what the OnePlus Nord pulled off — the flowers on that bush to the left are less fuzzy in the Motorola photo.Zooming in on an individual camellia with the macro lens on both phones, I prefer the brighter colors that the Motorola One captured. You could argue that the darker cast of the OnePlus Nord photo does a better job highlighting the beads of water on the flower's petals, which get somewhat lost in the Motorola shot, but I was aiming for brightness with this shot, and that's what the Motorola One delivered.Testing out the Night Vision mode on the Motorola One 5G Ace, we see that darkness is not this phone's friend. The shot is competent enough — you can see the stuffed animals, including that pink monstrosity that might otherwise be lost in the shadows without some serious post-processing. But the Motorola One 5G Ace blew out what light there was in the photo, washing out the wall in the background. The Pixel 4a 5G didn't have that problem with its Night Sight mode, and you get a more balanced shot, even without much light to help out. Portrait shots reveal how a lack of depth sensor hurts the Motorola One 5G Ace. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the photo of my daughter here, though the Motorola One washed out her skin a little and the background blur isn't very stylized. I also think the OnePlus shot handles my daughter's fuzzy gray beret better. But I was much more impressed by a similar photo I took when reviewing the Moto G Power (2021), a Motorola phone that does feature a depth sensor in its rear camera array. While the original Motorola One 5G had two selfie cams, this model makes do with a single 16MP front camera. It continues the theme of decent-though-not-spectacular shots for the Motorola One 5G Ace by capturing a pretty well composed though overly smoothed out self-portrait. The OnePlus Nord N10's shot is a more accurate representation of my skin tone, though only the right side of the background gets any kind of blur — the Motorola One shot has a consistent background throughout.To keep costs down, phone makers will opt for a lesser processor that's still capable of handling the tasks most people perform on their phones. In the case of the Motorola One 5G Ace, Motorola's turning to the Snapdragon 750G. That feels like a small step back from the Snapdragon 765G silicon powering the first 5G Motorola One, and our test numbers reflect that.In Geekbench 5, which measures general performance, the Ace's multicore score of 1,983 was only slightly better than the 1,952 result turned in by the first Motorola One. At least, the result was in line from what we've seen from other phones in the Ace's price class — the TCL 10 5G UW, which features a Snapdragon 765G, scored 1,932 while the OnePlus Nord N10 5G and its Snapdragon 690 chipset turned in a multicore result of 1,843.Graphics testing produced a similar result, with the Motorola One 5G Ace reaching 1,097 frames (6.60 frames per second) in 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited test. The TCL 10 5G outperformed Motorola with a 1,670 (10FPS) result while the Nord N10's 809 (4.8FPS) result lagged behind. I didn't run into any problems while playing PUBG Mobile on the Motorola One Ace 5G, though my hand occasionally muffled the sound from the bottom-firing speaker when I held the phone in landscape view.As the name of the phone implies, you get 5G connectivity with the Motorola One 5G Ace, though whether or not you get the promised speed boosts depends entirely where you are. I tested the phone on a T-Mobile SIM, and from my house — where I spend most of my time these days — the signal jumped between LTE and 5G fairly regularly. When I did manage to get a consistent 5G signal, the 14 Mbps download speeds are about what I get from T-Mobile's LTE in my area. Life-changing download speeds, those are not.Like its predecessor, the Motorola One 5G Ace features a 5,000 mAh battery, but makes more out of that massive power pack. The first 5G-ready Motorola One topped out at 9 hours and 14 minutes on our battery test, which involves continuous surfing over a cellular network until the phone runs out of power. The Ace pushed its result to 12 hours and 3 minutes averaged out across two tests.5G can demand a lot of power so there's only a handful of 5G phones on our longest phone battery life list, lead by the LG V60 ThinQ 5G (12:46). But the Motorola One 5G Ace is landing on that list with a time that's 15 minutes better than what the OnePlus Nord N10 5G managed.It's good that the Motorola One 5G lasts a while on a charge, because it takes a fair amount of time to recharge the phone. A half-hour of charging Motorola's drained device only got the battery capacity back to 25%. For context, the Nord N10 5G was up to 68% in that time, helped out by OnePlus' Warp Charge 30T technology. But even the Pixel 4a 5G, which offers 18W charging, got up to 46% after 30 minutes.Buy a Motorola phone, and you get a very clean version of Android that looks a lot like what you'd get from Google itself. The best thing about Motorola's My UX interface is that its few additions actually augment the OS instead of distract from it.Take Motorola's gesture controls, which return with the Motorola One 5G Ace. As with other Motorola phones, some gesture-based shortcuts can activate features on the phone, such as a chopping motion to turn on the flashlight or a quick camera watch with a twist of your wrist. The latest addition is Swipe to Split, and all you have to do is a drag a finger back and forth across the Motorola One 5G Ace's screen to launch a split-screen view that runs two apps at once.You don't get a great deal of software support with the Motorola One 5G Ace. While Motorola's committing to two years of security patches, this Motorola One device is only on tap for one software update. With the phone shipping with Android 10 installed, that means you get an update to the already released Android 11, and that's all.The Motorola One 5G Ace needs more than just a low price to separate itself from other 5G phones, especially with the TCL 10 5G UW matching its $399 cost and the latest OnePlus Nord N10 available for even less. The long-lasting battery on Motorola's phone helps somewhat, but other positives like a bright screen and strong macro lens aren't going to be the features that make people flock to your phone.There's nothing wrong with the Motorola One 5G Ace, though I do wish its camera handled low-light photos with more aplomb. But at a time when more phone makers are putting effort into producing lower-cost 5G devices, ""good enough"" is barely enough to make the grade."
72,ZTE Axon 20 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/zte-axon-20-5g,"Starting price: $449/£419 Display: 6.9-inch OLED (1080 x 2460), 90Hz Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.8), 8MP ultrawide (f/2.2), 2MP macro (f/2.4), 2 MP depth (f/2.4) Front camera: 342MP (f/2.0) Chipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB Expandable storage: MicroSD up to 2Tb Battery: 4220 mAh Charging: 30W wired Operating system: Android 10 with MiFavor 10.5 Size: 6.78 x 3.07 x 0.31 in (172.1 x 77.9 x 7.9 mm) Weight: 6.98 oz (198g)Usually, buying a slice of cutting-edge tech can be costly. But not so with the reasonably priced, boundary-breaking ZTE Axon 20 5G. The Chinese phone maker claims to have made the first commercial phone in the world with an under-display selfie camera, allowing a display-viewing experience unspoiled by notch, bezel or punch-hole.In this ZTE Axon 20 5G review, you'll see why we think the phone is another example of a strong mid-range Android device, offering an acceptable level of performance and enough premium features to satisfy users who don't want to spend huge sums of money on a flagship device. The Axon 20’s unique front camera, combined with the huge display and a good amount of computing power, makes this phone particularly a delight for movie watching and gaming.But you can’t buy the ZTE Axon 20 5G in the U.S. You can also find many of the same features on cheaper, more readily available phones. We prefer the OnePlus Nord and especially the Google Pixel 4a 5G for its better camera, but the Axon 20 5G is worth a look. While the ZTE Axon 20 5G is the first phone of its kind in some respects, it only costs $449 or £419. That's slightly more expensive than the equivalent 8GB RAM OnePlus Nord, or £80 less than the Pixel 4a 5G. ZTE launches the phone globally via the ZTE online store on December 21 It will be available in the U.K., but not the U.S. American readers who like the sound of the Axon will need to go through alternative online retailers or auction sites to get one, which requires a little more care and attention than just going to your local phone store, but is still manageable if you're willing. Only one version is on sale, providing you a black back, 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.That initial launch is very limited however. You need to get an invite from ZTE's website to be able to order the phone; in return you will get a free pair of ZTE LiveBuds earbuds. If you miss out on this first batch, the Axon will go on sale more widely next year.The moment you pick up the ZTE Axon 20 5G, you'll notice it's a big phone with its 6.9-inch display. At 6.9 ounces, however, it feels oddly light for the size. That's good news since you'll regularly need to change your grip to access all the icons across that enormous screen unless you have larger than average hands.While the top of the phone looks futuristic with its hidden camera, the bottom looks a few years out of date.Casting your eyes to the bottom of the display reveals one of the chunkiest chin bezels on a smartphone I've seen this year. It seems that what ZTE has given with one hand it's taken away with the other.Around the rather prominent metal side rail of the Axon 20, you have the trio of power, volume up and volume down buttons on the phone's right-hand side, then the SIM tray, USB-C port and speaker on the bottom. While the phone feels well put together, there is a noticeable “step” between the display and the rail, which not only makes the phone feel unusual when gripping it tightly, but also has me worried that there's no protection at all for this sophisticated display should I drop the phone.Flipping the phone around, you see some fairly large Axon 5G and ZTE branding, plus a rectangular camera array containing four sensors. The main 64MP camera gets a special mention on the camera bump itself, but none of it is particularly distracting thanks to a classy silver font color.I found myself entranced by the Axon 20’s color. The black is pretty plain, but the effect ZTE has added to the glass creates waves depending on how the light hits it. It looks like the little islands and channels that the tide creates on a sandy beach. Even in this dark colorway, this phone will draw attention to itself if you place it on a table in front of your friends.The Axon 20 5G's display measures a considerable 6.9 inches diagonally. ZTE uses  an FHD+ OLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate and 10-bit color. But this obviously pales in comparison to the fact that the screen has a disappearing camera hidden underneath it, making what ZTE calls a ""True Full Display.""We'll talk about the quality of that camera's images later on, but its impact on the display depends on what you're doing. The patch of pixels that hides the camera is noticeably lower-res than the main display around it, but ZTE has done its best to hide the camera. The included wallpapers are all dark at the top of the screen, which is when the effect is least visible. If you get an all-white webpage or settings menu, however, it looks kind of ugly.Sure, these are problems I wish didn't exist, but in the context of the wider phone market, ZTE’s under-screen camera is really quite impressive. As an iPhone 12 Pro user, I have to contend with the top center of my display permanently being unusable because of the camera/Face ID notch, but I don't really mind it.Watching the trailer for The Falcon and the Winter Soldier on the Axon 20 showed where this phone excels. The small square of irregular-looking display is easily overlooked when you have 6.9 inches of panel to enjoy Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson teaming up. What's harder to ignore is the sound. As well as hiding the camera underneath the screen, ZTE have also fitted an under-display top speaker. While it's OK when making a phone call, if you're trying to listen to music it's basically like listening to a mono speaker.The sound of Taylor Swift's ""Willow"" was pretty average from the Axon 20, which produced Swift's voice, piano and guitar nicely but none of the top or bottom end. The trouble is a misplaced palm will easily stifle the music unless you press your ear to the top of the phone to hear the tiny amount of sound coming from the under-display speaker. The Pixel 4a 5G's stereo speakers are far better balanced, and Google’s phone was actually able to play some of the less prominent of the latest Swift single too, like the violin or backing vocals.Normally I'd try out a phone's rear cameras first, but the Axon 20 5G is a special case, so we'll start with its 32MP front camera, hidden beneath the display. ZTE has used some clever hardware to create what is effectively a tiny one-way mirror in the display with transparent layers and a redesigned matrix of pixels. There's also some software trickery involved to overcome the color, contrast and focus issues that putting a camera behind the display creates.I took a series of portrait mode and standard selfie shots with the Axon’s front camera, followed by the same shots with the Pixel 4a 5G and my regularly-used iPhone 12 Pro, the device I consider the benchmark for good photography.With portrait mode on, the Axon produces an OK image, but one that I think the Pixel handles better. Not only is the cutout around my head and shoulders neater on the Pixel, but its post processing has had some restraint, making the photo look a lot more natural than the overly-smoothed one produced by the Axon. As is common with Chinese phones, selfie mode on the Axon automatically enables a set of beautification tools, although I disabled them before taking these shots.Turning off the bokeh effect, we see again how much brighter the ZTE's image is compared to the Pixel's. It's good to see that the Axon's photo performance isn't harmed too much by the display in the way of its sensor, but the Pixel remains my favorite for self portraits. Brightness in an image is one thing, but altering the colors to the point where they no longer represent reality is a step too far. Plus, the background still looks weirdly blurry even though we're not in portrait mode.The difference is even greater when comparing the standard selfies of the Axon and the iPhone 12. Apple's mix of 12MP selfie camera, a depth sensor and some subtle post processing make its image look much better.With portrait mode on, I still remain firmly in favor of the iPhone's picture. The Axon makes me look like I'm trapped in a magical dream sequence instead of standing in my parents' backyard; due to its softer focus and positively glowing color temperature.Hopefully these images are evidence that the under-screen selfie camera can still produce acceptable pictures, but you can do better, both in general and in this price range. Personally I'm only going to be certain an under-display camera is a good idea when a manufacturer with a better reputation for smartphone photography tries out this kind of display. ZTE is blazing a trail, but as is often the case, first doesn't mean best.Moving to the back camera array now, we'll start with the ZTE's centerpiece 64MP sensor. Typical of a sensor this size, it takes very bright photos, which you can see in this picture of a forest path.The Pixel 4a produces much richer colors, at the expense of accuracy to the original scene. I like both images on balance, but main sensors have to deal with more than just straightforward shots like this.Heading back out at twilight to try the phones’ respective night modes, I was not confident that the ZTE had what it took to challenge Google's industry-leading Night Sight low-light photo mode. That prediction came true, as you can see below. There is far more to see in this picture of a bare tree on the Pixel 4a's shot than on the Axon's, both in terms of color and detail, although the Pixel's photo looks more obviously post-processed.To make matters worse, it took the Pixel 4a about 2 seconds to take the picture, and before that it showed me a good estimation of the final image through the viewfinder. The Axon took about 8 seconds from pressing the shutter button to completing the capture, and I didn't know what the final shot would really look like until I checked it afterward in the gallery.You'll find the Axon 20’s 8MP ultrawide camera above the main sensor at the top of the camera stack. We see in this shot overlooking a golf course fairway that the image from the Pixel 4a's 16MP ultrawide sensor is much more saturated than the ZTE's, which doesn't have a resolution advantage to fall back on. Whether it's the sensor size or the post processing that's responsible, the Pixel's image is much better looking.The third main sensor on the ZTE is the 2MP macro camera. In theory, this allows you to take great extreme close-ups or photos of small objects. But unfortunately like all other macro cameras we've tested lately, the result isn't that good.This photo of a pot plant is obviously noisy and dark. That could be improved with some better lighting, but that goes against the snapshot-style photos most users want to take. The Axon is yet more proof that smartphone macro cameras are a waste of time.Finally, we have the Axon’s depth sensor, which doesn't take its own photos but helps add depth to other shots. It's a little finicky to use, since there's both portrait and bokeh modes available in the ZTE's camera app. The former relies on you taking a picture of a person, which I only found out after taking a picture and noticing there was no background blurring.With the correct setting selected, I once again took pictures of Lola the cavachon. I'm pleasantly surprised with the quality of both shots, and find it hard to pick between them. I like the depth of field present on both phones, and don't have much of a preference between either phone's representation of the colors in the scene. This is probably my favorite of all the photos I took with the ZTE, and goes to show how adding a depth sensor can benefit any phone.With so many strong competitors around this price range, photography is something the ZTE desperately needs to get right in order to stand a chance. The Axon 20 has plenty of breadth in its photo arsenal thanks to the big main camera and the dedicated depth sensor. But the results don't compare well to the competition, so the Axon isn't going to ascend to the hallowed halls of our best camera phone list where the Pixel 4a 5G resides.ZTE has given the Axon some decent silicon muscle for the price, but its power isn't limitless. Like many equivalent Android phones, the Axon uses a Snapdragon 765G chipset with a built-in Adreno 620 GPU, backed up by 8GB RAM.On the Geekbench 5 benchmarking app, the Axon scored 606 in the single core test and 1876 in the multi-core test. That's appreciably better than the Pixel 4a 5G's 1,614 multi-core score, but a little worse than the 1,948 achieved by the OnePlus Nord, perhaps due to the Nord using 12GB RAM instead of just 8GB. Graphically the ZTE gets some points back. On 3DMark's Wild Life graphics benchmark, the Axon scored 1,674 points and an average of 10 frames per second. That’s considerably better than the Pixel 4a 5G, which managed 1,199 points and 7 fps, despite sharing the same chipset and GPU.That's some fairly decent performance from a phone with a mid-tier chipset in. What makes the Axon 20’s performance better is a rather effective three-part cooling system within the phone. I didn't notice the phone heating up much during testing or charging, so it remains comfortable to use even when you're putting it through its paces.The name of ZTE’s phone gives away the Axon's 5G abilities. I was unable to test the speed while staying in the cell signal-free zone of Northumberland, England, but what is certain is that the Axon 20 only offers sub-6GHz 5G, not the mmWave sort.This won't be a problem for U.K. users, as sub-6GHz is all we have right now. Go to the U.S. however, and mmWave is the mode of choice for Verizon and its customers, as well as a few other 5G-ready nations around the world like South Korea. If you're going to buy this phone, double check what signal bands it supports on ZTE's website and cross-reference them with the bands that your mobile carrier supports. Otherwise you may end up with a 5G phone that can't actually use 5G.For its physical size, the battery in the Axon is kind of small at 4,220 mAh. Usually when phones are pushing 7 inches in size, they can require as much as 5,000 mAh, but the Axon 20 still features an acceptable amount of battery to have. We were unable to perform our usual battery rundown test, but I can report that playing fullscreen YouTube videos non-stop over Wi-Fi for an hour ate about 10% of the total battery capacity. That equates to enough juice for a full day's video watching, and likely longer if you're using the phone for less power-intensive tasks like messaging and social media.If you were worried about that battery draining, rest assured that ZTE has charging sewn up. The Axon only offers wired charging, but at 30W, it's plenty quick. In our test, the phone filled up from 0% to 31% over 15 minutes, 61% over 30 minutes, and was filled to the brim by 58 minutes. That's not the fastest we've seen, but that's certainly respectable performance that will satisfy most users, equalling the 30W charger with the OnePlus Nord and beating the 18W charger of the Pixel 4a 5G.ZTE has equipped the Axon 20 5G with MiFavor UI, its take on Android 10. Unfortunately that means no Android 11 features, at least not yet. ZTE says it will be introducing the new version of Android soon.While I don't think it's the most attractive version of Android I've come across, moving through the ZTE's menus is easy to understand and pleasant enough to look at. The only major difference is that the home screens loop around to the start when you reach either end, which to me makes more sense than having it artificially stop and make you scroll back and forth all the time.What is also good is that the Axon 20 doesn't come with a bunch of pre-installed apps. Aside from the basic Google ones, all you get is a custom browser, a phone switching app, a game assist app, ZTE's customer support app, plus Facebook and WPS Office. If even these are too many, you can easily delete them or move them off of your home screen into the app drawer.If it weren't for its under-display camera, the ZTE Axon 20 5G would be quite an ordinary mid-range Android phone. This phone excels in multiple ways. The big notchless display makes the Axon 5G a compelling option for watching video and playing games (provided you plug in headphones to avoid using the sub-par speakers). And the disappearing selfie camera will draw as much attention as more expensive phones.Overall, we prefer the Google Pixel 4a 5G because of its better cameras. And spending a little more money will net you the excellent OnePlus Nord, which is a pretty big step-up in UX and photography quality from the Axon 20 5G. Despite ZTE's impressive party trick, there are a few too many caveats to make this Android phone a top pick."
73,Huawei Mate 40 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/huawei-mate-40-pro,"Price: £1,099 Display: 6.76 inches FHD+ (2772 x 1344) with 90Hz refresh rate Colors: Black, Mystic Silver CPU: HiSilicon Kirin 9000 RAM: 8GB Storage: 256GB Rear cameras: 50MP main (f1.9), 20MP cine/ultra-wide (f1.8), 12MP telephoto, laser depth sensor Zoom: 5x optical, up to 50x digital Front cameras: 13MP wide (f/2.4) & 3D Depth Sensing Camera 5G: sub6GHz Operating system: Android 11 with EMUI 11 Battery: 4,400 mAh Max. charging speed: 66W wired, 50W wireless Size: 6.41 x 2.97 x 0.35 inches (162.9 x 75.5 x 9.1 mm) Weight: 7.47 ounces (212g)The Huawei Mate 40 Pro arrives a little more than a year after the Chinese telecoms giant was rudely booted out of the U.S. Government's good graces, and had to rebuild its software ecosystem back up from ground level with the benefit of Android. The Mate 40 Pro is Huawei’s best attempt at a Google-less smartphone so far, but is it enough to genuinely tempt users away from Samsung, OnePlus, or even Apple?If you're obsessed with having the best hardware in your handset, possibly. Huawei's delivered another polished experience with its most powerful silicon and most competitive cameras yet. However like the P40 Pro before it, having to accept this phone’s software limitations is a pain.Things aren’t as bad as they used to be thanks to some alternatives and workarounds Huawei now has in place, plus the benefits of Multi-screen collaboration with other Huawei devices might tempt productivity-hungry users. For the average user though, our Huawei Mate 40 Pro review finds that this isn't an automatic choice for your next phone.Once again, U.S. users won't find the Mate 40 Pro at their local phone store, with the only option being online retailers who import devices from overseas. Be aware though that this can cost a lot more than you might expect, and you'll be wise to check which 4G and 5G bands the specific model supports to see whether the phone works with your chosen carrier.In the U.K., the Mate 40 Pro's a lot easier to find. It's available in a single 8GB RAM/256GB storage spec in a choice of Black or Mystic Silver for £1099.99 — the same as you'll pay for an iPhone 12 Pro Max with 128GB storage. It’s also in the same ballpark as the £949 Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and the £1,179 Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.From the front, the Huawei Mate 40 Pro better resembles its smaller P40 Pro sibling than its Mate 30 Pro predecessor, because of its pill-shaped front camera cutout in the top left corner.That approach is much more attractive than the Mate 30's central notch, but it still takes up a lot more room than the common single punch-hole camera you find on most Android phones.Around the sides, you'll see Huawei has kept the dramatic 88-degree curves on the display, which meet neatly with the more subtle rear curvature to make a phone that's very comfortable to hold in your palm. However the phone seems noticeably thicker than many others I've tried this year; the 7.5-ounce weight adds to that bigger feel, too.Turning the phone over reveals Huawei’s new ""Space Ring"" camera array, with the four sensors arranged in the corners of an imagined square within the circular donut. It's a neat homage to the circle of cameras on the Mate 30, but I think I prefer the older style that doesn't leave a random gap in the middle. That said, Huawei has put the hole in the donut to good use by placing the Leica branding there, reminding us all of the partnership between Huawei and the German camera and lens maker.With the Mate 40 Pro, Huawei has once again produced a trademark uncomplicated design, which looks particularly classy in this black color option. The Mystic Silver with its pearlescent quality would make for a more eye-catching color if you'd prefer. Both colors feature a small splash of red on the power button, another Mate series trademark. Next to it you'll see that there's a volume rocker, which is interesting since Huawei got rid of that feature on the Mate 30 last year, replacing it with on-screen volume control gestures. Those return, accessed by double tapping either edge, but you can also control it like a normal phone if that's your preference.At 6.76 inches, the Mate 40 Pro has a display that’s on the larger side, though it’s still smaller than  the 6.78-inch OnePlus 8 Pro, or the 6.9-inch Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra.Those three phones also beat the Mate 40 in terms of resolution and refresh rate. Huawei’s phone offers an FHD panel with a maximum refresh rate of 90Hz. All the rest offer QHD and 120Hz but pay for it in shorter battery life, something Huawei claims it has no problem with.As a test, I watched the trailer for the second season of gritty anthropomorphic animal anime Beastars. The FHD resolution didn't affect my enjoyment of the plot teasers, displaying the textures of the different characters' fur and the strong flat colors the show uses to reference its manga origins vividly.During my time using the phone for various everyday tasks, I didn't mind the slightly lower refresh rate, instead appreciating the size and brightness of the display. Provided you have a pocket or bag big enough, you'll enjoy taking in web pages, social media feeds or streaming content on this screen, which even outdoors in bright sunlight won't let you down.Swapping to some music, I tried listening to bluegrass classic ""If it Hadn't Been For Love"" by The Steeldrivers, and was really pleased with Huawei's decision to ditch the anaemic sub-display speaker found on earlier phones. Now a standard speaker fires out of the phone's top edge, leaving the display unblemished and providing a well balanced sound. The speaker skews heavily toward vocals and treble, though, which is why I still prefer the more all-round sound of the iPhone 12 Pro.Here's where we get to see exactly what the Leica-tuned cameras on the Huawei Mate 40 Pro are capable of. The rear cameras feature a 50MP main camera using Huawei's unique RYYB sensor for increased light sensitivity, a 20MP ultrawide camera that doubles as the phone's main video camera, and a 12MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom and a maximum of 50x digital zoom. There's also a laser depth sensor to help with special effects and AR apps when needed. Grabbing an iPhone 12 Pro as a comparison, I took the Mate 40 Pro for a tour of Paddington's canals. Our first shot, overlooking Rembrandt Gardens, shows a typical Huawei trait — cooler color temperatures. The autumn leaves and lawns of this small public park look more attractive from the iPhone's perspective, but it left the open sky areas overexposed. The Mate 40 managed to excellently show off the late afternoon sky.An ultrawide shot of the canal is a little tricky to compare since the Huawei and iPhone have different fields of view for their lenses. You can fit much more into a shot with the 0.5x iPhone camera, but the Mate 40 Pro's 0.6x camera captures the colors in a much more interesting way.I did two telephoto camera comparisons of this statue, since the Huawei has a 5x optical zoom, while the iPhone’s optical zoom tops out at 2x optical. At 5x, the Huawei is superior as you'd expect. Its image is at an ideal level of saturation, while the iPhone's image is duller, and also has significant noise in the back of the shot.But 2x, the competition is much closer than I predicted. The unpleasant fuzziness from the iPhone's image has gone, but the Mate 40 retains its more attractive coloring. I was expecting this two-part round to be a draw, each side winning when using only optical zoom. But I feel like due to its versatility, this round belongs to the Huawei.My final test with the two phones' rear cameras was this nighttime shot of a pub. The iPhone's shot has warmer colors, but the Huawei was better able to keep the flares of light small, which leads to a more accurate representation of the scene's colors as I saw them.Finally, I tried out the portrait selfie mode, another category I'd expect the Mate 40 Pro to do well in thanks to its combination of a 13MP camera and a 3D depth sensor, similar to the iPhone 12 Pro's TrueDepth 12MP front camera.These two images could both easily be my preference depending on the day or which way the wind was blowing. The iPhone's shot looks more artistic with a better blur effect and a more flattering coloring for my hair, skin and jacket. On the other hand, the Mate 40s more honest representation of me and my surroundings has its own appeal. Both phones did a great job at cutting me out from the background though, so I have no complaints from a technical standpoint.It's taken Huawei a few attempts, but whatever software tweaks it's figured out over the past few months have really helped it take better shots under normal lighting conditions, as well as the bright and dark settings where its phones have traditionally done well. The Mate 40 Pro’s impressive hardware can go blow-for-blow with Apple's latest iPhone without a problem, and I find it difficult to pick between the two phones' photos most of the time. I am keen to try the Mate 40 Pro against some other strong photography phones like the Pixel 5 or the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and see if it truly has what it takes to be one of the best camera phones around.The Mate 40 takes a different approach to its internal components than the majority of its Android rivals. Instead of going for the standard duo of a Snapdragon 865 and either 8GB or 12GB RAM, Huawei has used its own Kirin 9000 chipset; and you’ll find only 8GB of memory.Fortunately, through Huawei's Phone Clone, AppGallery and Petal Search apps, you're able to get the apps you want from copying them from your old phone, downloading APK files from trusted sources or by using an alternative app store. It's not quite as straightforward as just searching on the Play Store and hitting download, but if you're comfortable living without the Google app ecosystem, you can basically get any Android app you like on the Mate 40 with a bit more effort.You've also got the option to open and use up to three apps at once with the Multi-Window feature, and an ""Eyes-On Display"" that reduces notification volume and keeps the device awake when the phone detects you're looking at it. Plus there's a bunch of visual upgrades that make menus smarter and transitions between them smoother. You’ll also find upgrades to Huawei's Celia digital assistant, and the return of Private View, which makes sure your notifications stay hidden if someone who isn't you picks up the phone.Currently, we are unable to get Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, working on the Mate 40 Pro. However, we were able to run GFX Bench's Wild Life graphics benchmark, to give us an idea of how well the Huawei performs when it needs to render detailed graphics. Its average score was 6,116 frames, with a frame rate of 36.6 FPS. That puts it a little bit behind the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s 41 FPS result, but way ahead of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and its 26 FPS performance.That's a pretty impressive result, enough to make the Mate 40 the most powerful Android device we've tested, even if it can't beat Apple's A14 chip in the iPhone 12 series. Do keep in mind that the Kirin 9000 is a generation ahead of the Snapdragon 865 we see in many Android flagships from this year, with Huawei's chip using a 5-nanometer process instead of 7 nm for the Snapdragon chipset. (The smaller process means more transistors and more power, to put it simply.) We'll have to see if the Mate 40 Pro can keep its lead when we start to see the expected Snapdragon 875 system-on-chip find its way into phones at the start of next year.The Huawei Mate 40 Pro features Huawei’s own EMUI 11 interface, with the open-source version of Android 11 running beneath it. Unfortunately, the Mate 40 Pro can’t use Google apps at all due to U.S. government restrictions barring companies from doing business with Huawei. The phone also can't access the Google Play Store to download other Android apps. If you own a larger Huawei device like a MateBook X Pro or a MatePad Pro, then you can make use of Huawei's robust Multi-screen Collaboration tools, letting you operate your phone from a PC or tablet. New for the Mate 40 range's launch is the ability to have multiple apps from your phone open in different windows on a MateBook laptop — a feature that looks supremely useful if you already own one device and like to use your phone a lot for work.On the negative side, you do get an awful lot of pre-installed apps, plus some recommendation folders which contain a rotating array of other suggested apps for you to download. Tidying up the Mate 40 Pro's home screens will take some doing, particularly since without an app library, you can't remove an app without straight-up deleting it. Also, one thing that annoyed me particularly is that EMUI 11 doesn't have a dark mode scheduling function unlike basically all other operating systems. You can switch it on fairly easily yourself from the Quick Settings menu in the notification shade, but the fact it doesn't offer an automatic option seems like a big oversight, particularly since there have been complaints about this missing feature since EMUI 10 last year.Beyond the apps, EMUI 11 hides some unique enhancements compared to other Android skins. For example, Huawei has continued its air gestures system, which debuted on the Mate 30. This time around, there are more gestures you can use, allowing you to wake the phone up; swipe screens up, down, left or right; and use a pressing gesture to answer phonecalls or play/pause media. All this is powered by the same sensor that also enables Face Recognition, which you can use to secure the phone alongside the Mate 40’s under-display fingerprint sensor.Once you learn the ideal distance to perform the gestures from, they’re surprisingly reliable and easy to pull off. It's great if you're the kind of person who keeps their phone upright on a stand when not in use, or in certain situations like cooking when you want to access the phone but don't want to touch it with dirty hands. However the left and right navigation gestures are limited to certain apps, which may prove irritating depending on what you're doing.I found face recognition to be reliable enough on the Mate 40, allowing me to not really use my thumbprint to unlock the Mate 40. No other Android maker offers properly secure facial recognition like this, after Google dropped Motion Sense from the Pixel 5. That means that the only rival left for Huawei in this area is Apple's Face ID. Face unlocking is equally fast on either phone, but the iPhone still unlocks at angles where the Mate 40 Pro can't detect you.Thanks to the Kirin 9000 chip, the Mate 40 Pro has 5G built in. However, it's got sub6GHz compatibility only, since the Chinese market only has access to this flavor of 5G. Given that mmWave is primarily used in the U.S., where the Mate 40 isn’t available, that’s not much of a limitation. At 4,400 mAh, the Mate 40 Pro actually has a slightly smaller battery than the 4,500 mAh power pack in the Mate 30 Pro. However raw capacity doesn't tell the full story, and the Mate 40 Pro remains a long-lasting phone.Even after performing tests, watching videos and downloading several apps over Wi-Fi over the course of an eight-hour evening's chill-out session, the Mate 40 still had two thirds of its capacity left. We've yet to perform a formal battery rundown test on the phone, but once we do we'll update this review with the results and how it compares to the competition.Huawei has just managed to leapfrog the competition with the included 66W wired charger, beating the OnePlus 8T's 65W charger by one whole watt. The Mate 40 Pro can also wirelessly charge at up to 50W, the fastest we've seen on a phone so far, although without one of Huawei's proprietary chargers we were unable to try that out.After 30 minutes of charging, a drained Mate 40 Pro made it to 84% the phone was completely filled by the 44-minute mark. The OnePlus 8T manages 93% full in 30 minutes, likely due to the dual battery system that allows it to charge two cells at a lower speed, rather than a single cell at a higher speed like the Huawei does.Even if it isn't quite as fast as the best charging phone around, being able to charge this quickly is still enough to satisfy most users' needs. And at this speed, the Huawei still trashes the 25W standard charger that the Samsung Galaxy S20 and Galaxy Note 20 series come with. Meanwhile, Apple's newest 20W charger has to be bought separately for the iPhone 12 series.After extensive testing for this Huawei Mate 40 Pro review, there’s no doubt about the phone’s strongest features — the cameras, the performance, even parts of the software user experience. However if you asked me would I recommend the Mate 40 Pro, I'd regretfully say no.The Mate 40 is an awesome big phone, but why pick this over an S20 Ultra, or a Note 20 Ultra, or a OnePlus 8 Pro? Samsung's phones also have excellent cameras, while OnePlus devices use an excellent version of Android that still has Google apps. Both of these brands' flagship phones offer similar performance for less money than you'd pay for the Huawei too.It's taking Huawei some concerted effort, but the phone maker has  shown that it can still play in a highly competitive phones market even with a significant Google-shaped chink in its armor. If the U.S. government's trade ban lifts any time soon (and with a new administration on the way, it might), we'll have to reevaluate things. For now though, the Mate 40 Pro is a phone you should only buy after some careful consideration of the price, literal and figurative, you're paying for the phone's outstanding features."
74,Nokia 8 V 5G UW,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/nokia-8-v-5g-uw-review,"Nokia used to be the company you turned to for a cell phone, at least up until smartphones came along and pushed Nokia off to the sidelines in the U.S. HMD Global, which now manages the Nokia brand, thinks the Nokia 8 V 5G UW could be the device to change that, even if that name doesn't exactly trip lightly off the tongue.Starting price: $699 Display (Pixels): 6.81-inch LCD (2400 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 765G RAM: 6GB Storage: 64GB Expandable?: Yes, up to 1 TB Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.8); 12MP ultrawide (f/2.2); 2MP macro lens; 2MP depth sensor Front camera: 24MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 4,500 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 8:26 Size: 6.8 x 3.1 x 0.35 inches Weight: 8.11 ouncesIf you're familiar with the Nokia 8.3 5G that arrived in the U.S. earlier this fall, then the Nokia 8 V 5G UW will be familiar. These phones share nearly every key feature, save for one — the Nokia 8 V is available through Verizon, the first time that a higher-end Nokia phone has been sold via a U.S. carrier in roughly six years.Will that help the Nokia 8 V 5G UW stand out in an increasingly crowded field of less expensive 5G-ready options? This Nokia 8 V 5G UW review will look at what sets this phone apart from the rest of the 5G crowd.The Nokia 8 V 5G UW costs $699 at Verizon, which seems to be the sweet spot for Snapdragon 765G-powered 5G phones. At Verizon alone, you'll find the LG Velvet, Google Pixel 5, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and iPhone 12 mini all available at that same price.Not only is the field of $699 phones getting crowded, but the Nokia 8 V is also getting squeezed by cheaper 5G devices. The TCL 10 5G UW is another Verizon exclusive, and this 5G phone only costs $399. You can pick up a Pixel 4a 5G through Google tied to Verizon's wireless service, and you'll only have to part with $499. In other words, it's going to take the Nokia phone some doing to stand out from the crowd.The Nokia 8 V 5G UW doesn't skimp on size. I placed the phone next to an iPhone 11 Max — one of the biggest phones I have lying around — and the Nokia 8 V is noticeably taller at 6.8 x 3.1 x 0.35 inches. At 8.11 ounces, you're not likely to forget you're toting around the new Nokia phone.Flip the device over and the first thing you'll notice is a circular camera array protruding from the phone's polycarbonate back. Plenty of logos greet you, too, from a vertical Nokia to Verizon's 5G label. Logos aside, it's a pretty slick look, though you will notice a lot of fingerprints on the Meteor Gray exterior.I'm always happy to see a headphone jack like the one on the bottom of the Nokia 8 V, as HMD Global resists the temptation to follow the lead of other phone makers and remove that port. I'm less pleased with the buttons that appear on the Nokia 8 V. There's a Google Assistant button on the left side of the phone that can summon the virtual assistant and seemingly do nothing else. It's superfluous. The power button contains the phone's fingerprint sensor and is too recessed into the Nokia 8 V's frame to find easily; it also happens to be immediately under the volume toggle, so I wound up tapping that a lot when I meant to unlock my phone.HMD placed a single speaker on the bottom of the phone. It's really easy to cover that speaker up with your hand when you're holding the phone in a landscape orientation — like when you're playing a game — and that can muffle the audio.The reason HMD went big with the Nokia 8 V 5G UW is to house the phone's massive 6.81-inch FHD display. I'm not a fan of big phones as a rule, but even I have to concede that a screen this size is very immersive, whether you're playing games or watching video. Rummaging through houses in PUBG Mobile, I spotted details in some of the weapons and other gear that I came across that I never see on phones with smaller displays.The Nokia 8 V 5G UW uses an LCD panel, and I think that has some impact on the colors showcased by the device. Everything looks fine in scenes that are bright, like the colorful outfits on the wrestlers in an episode of GLOW that I streamed on Netflix or on the desert planet Arrakis in the trailer for the upcoming Dune movie. But once the action moves into the shadows things start to look murkier on the Nokia 8 V's screen.Our testing found that the 113.9% of the sRGB color gamut, while the p-OLED panel on the LG Velvet managed to recreate 140.6%. The Pixel 5, which also features an OLED screen captured 128.8%. The Nokia 8 V is about as accurate as its rivals when it comes to colors with a Delta-E rating of 0.29; the LG Velvet got a nearly identical 0.30 score. (The closer to zero, the more accurate the colors.)However, the Nokia phone lags the competition when it comes to brightness. We measure the Nokia 8 V at 358 nits with adaptive brightness turned on. That's well off the pace set by the LG Velvet (567 nits), Pixel 5 (610 nits) and iPhone 12 mini (505 nits). When testing the phone outside, I had to crank display brightness all the way up on the Nokia 8 V.HMD proudly points out that its Nokia 8.3 models features Zeiss optics in its PureView camera array, as the phone maker looks to stake its claim that the Nokia 8 V 5G UW belongs among the ranks of the best camera phones. It certainly doesn't skimp on cameras to back up that claim. The Nokia 8 V features a 64MP main camera and a 12MP ultrawide angle shooter with a 120-degree field of view. Both the main and ultrawide shooters support Super Night mode for low light photography. A 2MP macro lens and 2MP depth sensor round out the rear cameras.The Nokia 8 V fares well when shooting some Star Wars-themed tiki mugs outside on a partly day. It captures details that are harder to spot in the photo taken by the OnePlus Nord N10 5G, from the swirls in C3-PO's eyes to the curve at the top of the wampa mug. For whatever reason, the background on the Nokia 8 V shot has more of a blur than I'd like, but overall, the focus of the shot is on the mugs, where it should be.The corner of the kitchen housing my oven can get pretty dark, with only a harsh overhead light to illuminate things. Perhaps that's why this photo of a pasta sauce I was making turned out so dark when shot by the Nokia 8 V. Half the pot seems lost in shadows and the meatballs lack the definition that exists in the Pixel 4a 5G's photo. The color that is in the Nokia photo is fairly rich — that's a fairly dark red for the sauce — though the more orange-ish tint in the Pixel photo is probably truer to life.Speaking of dim lighting, I took a photo of the miniature hat collection I have decorating my basement office right after sundown to see how the Super Night mode on the Nokia 8 V measures up for low-light photos. The answer, when compared to the Pixel 4a 5G's best-in-class Night Sight, is not very well. The Pixel photo looks fully illuminated, and many of the logos on each helmet are clearly visible. The Nokia shot is still a little dark, and the logos on the Astro, Met and Cleveland helmets are lost in the shadows.The Nokia 8 V redeems itself with its ultrawide angle lens, which captures a much wider view than the comparable camera on the Pixel 4a 5G. (We have to crop the photos to fit inside the slider up above, but trust me — there's a lot more detail to the sides that the Nokia ultrawide angle lens include in its shot.) The sky's a deeper shade of blue in the Nokia photo, and that's reflected in the water. The plants along the shoreline look greener, too, which makes for a much more colorful shot overall.So long as phone makers keep insisting that people want macro lenses on their phone, I'm going to have to keep taking photos, even though I suspect that few people will ever make use of a dedicated macro sensor. Still, the NOkia 8 V's version did a pretty good job, picking up the details on some late-blooming tomatoes in my garden. I like that mini-tendrils on the tomato vine are visible, and the macro lens really captures the texture of that still-green tomato. Some people may prefer how the OnePlus Nord N10 handled the shot, using shadows to bring greater definition to the red tomatoes in the background. But I think the Nokia phone produces a better overall shot by drawing your attention to the tomato in the foreground.My daughter may have averted her eyes when it came time for me to test Portrait mode on the Nokia 8 V 5G UW, but that phone still produced a very good shot, adding a stylish blur to the background while keeping her hair, face and clothes very much in focus. You can see the freckles on her face, and the Nokia camera also faithfully recreated the texture on her sweater. Even with my daughter staring into the sun, her face isn't washed out, though the Pixel 4a 5G has done a better job by keeping the colors of its photo warmer overall. Still, I'm not at all disappointed by what the Nokia 8 V did here.Color tone also is the deciding factor in this selfie face-off between the Nokia 8 V 5G UW and Pixel 4a 5G. The Nokia's 24MP front camera seems overwhelmed by some of the light, and a result, the left side of my face is a little overexposed. The Pixel 4a 5G doesn't have this problem, reproducing my face in a nice, warm tone. It seems that a leaf from the fig tree appearing just beyond the part in my hair flummoxed the software on the Nokia 8 V just a little bit. It's not very blurred, while that same leaf blends into the background in the Pixel 4a 5G selfie.Phone makers producing 5G phones have settled on the Snapdragon 765G as their mobile processing platform of choice, and the Nokia 8 V 5G UW is no exception. It's easy to understand why — while the Snapdragon 765G isn't Qualcomm's most powerful chip, it can handle most of the things smartphone users throw at it, and it's got an integrated X52 modem. It's also not as expensive as the Snapdragon 865 in leading Android flagships, which means phone makers can keep costs down.As a result, the Nokia 8 5G UW and its Snapdragon 765G processor turn in results on benchmarking tests that are fairly consistent with phones that use the same chipset. The Nokia phone's single- and multicore scores of 610 and 1,930 on Geekbench 5 are in line with the LG Velvet (619 and 1,927) and well ahead of the Pixel 5's numbers (596 and 1,617). The Nokia 8 V also outperformed the Motorola Edge (595 and 1,867), which uses a slightly less powerful Snapdragon 765 chipset.Of course, the Nokia 8 V 5G UW doesn't even come close to matching the performance of the identically priced iPhone 12 mini. Thanks to that phone's class-leading A14 Bionic chip, it turned in a multicore Geekbench 5 score of 4,123, the best result we've seen on that test.When it comes to graphics, the Nokia 8 V's performance finished well ahead of the Pixel 5 on 3DMark's Wild Life Unlimited test. The Nokia phone recorded 1,670 frames (10 frames per second), topping the Pixel's 1,160 frame (7 FPS) result. But the LG Velvet more or less matched the Nokia phone with a result of 1,680 frames (10 FPS).The most processor-intensive apps probably won't run as smoothly on the Nokia 8 V 5G UW, though I had no problem playing PUBG Mobile apart from the occasional stutter. I could switch apps seamlessly and stream video to my heart's content.HMD Global adds 6GB of RAM to help out the Snapdragon 765G, but only equips the phone with a meager 64GB of storage. You're able to add up to 1TB via a microSD card.One of the main attractions for the Nokia 8 V 5G is its 5G compatibility — and not just any 5G. Because this phone has been tailored specifically for Verizon 5G, it works with the high-speed mmWave-based 5G towers Verizon has put up in parts of 55 cities around the US. Verizon's reliance on mmWave has allowed it to claim the title of fastest 5G network, at least in the early days of the new technology. Connect with one of Verizon's mmWave nodes, and you can watch download speeds blast past 1 Gbps while those around you make do with 100 Mbps speeds.To enjoy those speeds, though, you've got to be in line of sight of one of Verizon's mmWave towers, which means being outside — mmWave doesn't deal well with windows and walls — and in very specific locations. Verizon has also launched a nationwide 5G network that reaches 1,800 cities and 200 million people, though with slower speeds. This is the flavor of Verizon 5G you're more likely to experience with the Nokia 8 V 5G UW.Even then, coverage is finicky. I live in a place with very good Verizon coverage, but only occasionally does the 5G indicator flicker on the Nokia 8 V's screen — I can pick up a 5G signal in my kitchen, for example, but not in my backyard. Even then, 5G download speeds are slower — like, by a lot — when compared to what I normally get from Verizon's LTE.In other words, 5G remains a work in progress. If you get the Nokia V 5G UW, you're doing so with the understanding that Verizon's network is evolving and better, faster days are — hopefully — ahead.Our 5G phone testing to date has indicated that 5G connectivity chews up and spits out the battery life of these handsets, requiring big power packs to get the devices through the day on a charge. The Nokia 8 V 5G UW looks to combat this with a 4,500 mAh battery, but unfortunately, it's not enough.The Nokia 8 V 5G lasted an average of 8 hours and 26 minutes on our battery test, which involves setting the phone's screen to 150 nits of brightness and then having it surf the web over cellular until it runs out of power. That's roughly 90 minutes less than the average smartphone lasts on our test, and it's also below the performance we've seen from other 5G phones. I tested the Motorola Edge, another $699 5G phone, on Verizon's network, and it held out for more than 12 hours. Other 5G phones like the Pixel 5 (9:29), Galaxy S20 FE (8:58) and iPhone 12 mini (7:28) turned in times closer to the Nokia 8 V's result.Don't expect the Nokia 8 V 5G to charge back up quickly, either. Using the included charger, we got the phone back to a 34% charge after 30 minutes. Apple's 20W charger — which is sold separately — can get the iPhone 12 mini back to 60% in that same time. The Motorola Edge, not exactly a speed demon when it comes to charging, reached 36% after half-an-hour.HMD Global calls the Nokia 8 V 5G UW ""Android 11 ready,"" which is a nicer way of saying that the older Android 10 comes pre-installed on the phone. There's no timeline on when to expect that Android 11 update, though HMD says you can expect both that update as well as next year's Android 12 to land on your phone. That means a relatively up-to-date phone through the end of 2022.The version of Android installed on the Nokia 8 V 5G UW is fairly clean, and for the most part, you won't find duplicate apps replicating the functions of Google's preinstalled apps. However, because this is a Verizon phone, you will have a lot of Verizon apps to deal with. Some, like the My Verizon app for managing your account with the carrier, are perfectly welcome. Others, like Verizon's Digital Secure, Cloud and Call Filter apps seem unnecessary. And I'm not sure why Yahoo Mail comes pre-loaded on the phone when I've already got a Gmail app — I mean, other than the fact that Verizon owns Yahoo and would appreciate it very much if you use that service.The Nokia 8 V 5G UW has a problem, and it's not one that has anything to do with the phone's hardware or software. After running tests for this Nokia 8 V 5G UW review, in fact, I found plenty to like about this particular handset, from its excellent ultrawide angle camera to the fact that it supports Verizon's high-speed flavor of 5G.The problem, though, is that the Nokia 8 V 5G doesn't offer anything that at least one phone in its price range doesn't do better. The LG Velvet is a more stylish looking 5G handset. The Motorola Edge lasts longer on a charge. The Pixel 5 takes better photos. And if you're willing to look beyond Android devices, the iPhone 12 mini is one of the best phones overall.  All of these phones cost the same as the Nokia 8 V, and with the exception of the Motorola Edge, all of them support Verizon's 5G network, too.If you're a Verizon subscriber looking for a 5G phone for less than $700, the Nokia 8 V 5G UW certainly will find its way onto your shortlist. Whether it winds up being your ultimate choice depends how much you want a large screen and a top-performing ultrawide angle lens."
75,Motorola One 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-one-5g,"Price: $445 OS: Android 10 Display: 6.7-inch LCD (2520x1080; 90 Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 765 RAM: 4GB Storage: 128GB; expandable up to 1TB Rear camera: Quad-lens: 48MP wide (ƒ/1.8), 8MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2), 5MP macro (ƒ/2.2), 2MP depth (ƒ2.2) Front camera: 8MP (ƒ/2.2), 16MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2) Battery: 5,000 mAh Size: 6.61 x 2.91 x 0.35 inches Weight: 7.3 ouncesBlink and you might miss the Motorola One 5G. This $445, 6.7-inch behemoth has landed within Motorola’s busiest year in recent memory. The company has launched a slew of Moto E and Moto G-series handsets in addition to the more feature-driven Motorola One line, re-entered the premium space with the Motorola Edge family and plans to deliver not one but two Razr foldables before 2020 is through.The differences between each offering in this deluge of phones are often slight and hard to parse out, but the Motorola One 5G certainly benefits from the best elevator pitch of the lot: it’s the cheapest 5G phone you can buy in the U.S., save for T-Mobile’s just-launched Revvl 5G.However, Motorola is far from the only company thrusting itself headstrong into the venue of cheap 5G phones. And amidst the likes of the OnePlus Nord, Samsung Galaxy A51 and A71 5G, LG Velvet, and the upcoming Pixel 4a 5G, the Motorola One 5G simply doesn’t stand out.Our Motorola One 5G review finds a device that, while powerful, suffers from a cumbersome design, with an unremarkable display, outdated software crippled by bloatware and a gimmicky array of cameras outperformed by the rest of its class.The Motorola One 5G is available exclusively through AT&T, where it costs $445. There’s just one configuration, with 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, and one color — Oxford Blue.While the AT&T exclusivity is a bummer, the Motorola One 5G’s low price almost makes it the most affordable 5G device on sale in the U.S. at the time this is being written. The Samsung Galaxy A51 5G costs $499, as does the soon-to-ship Google Pixel 4a 5G. TCL has long teased the arrival of its first 5G phone, the TCL 10 5G, with a price under $500, though the company hasn’t elaborated on that since that handset was announced way back in January.In previous years, spending less than $500 on a smartphone might have guaranteed a chintzy plastic build and uninspired design. Fortunately, thanks to efforts around the industry — from OnePlus, to Google, to Apple and even Samsung with its latest Galaxy A series devices — that expectation is slowly being eroded.Alas, the Motorola One 5G doesn’t find itself in that elite company. This is a phone that is cheap and certainly feels it, with the entirety of its bulky frame clad in glossy, tacky plastic, and a stippled, iridescent finish on the back that simply tries too hard to catch the eye.The Motorola One 5G is absolutely gigantic, too. While there have been other 6.7-inch phones before, most of them have been on the pricier side, with slimmer bezels than what you’ll find on this device, as well as curved display glass that helps fit more display into a compact chassis.In contrast, the Motorola One 5G does not have a curved screen, and at more than three tenths of an inch thick, it isn’t nearly as slender in hand as the 6.7-inch Galaxy S20 Plus, for example. The phone’s narrow 21:9 aspect ratio does help things a bit, but this is still very much a device that requires two hands to operate. That said, I do like the side-mounted fingerprint sensor and power key, which puts unlocking within easy reach of your thumb (at least if you’re right handed).On the front, you’ll find dual hole-punch selfie cameras in one of the stranger in-display implementations we’ve seen as of late. The lenses themselves are separated, rather than joined together in one pill-shaped cutout. Motorola’s approach looks considerably less elegant and takes up a fair bit of space in the upper-left corner. Also, because of design limitations inherent in LCD panels, there’s a noticeable degree of dimming and discoloration around the camera holes that is impossible to unsee on stark white screens.One perk of the Motorola One 5G’s design is its 3.5-millimeter headphone jack, which at least means buyers won’t have to shell out more money on a set of wireless headphones.Motorola had to cut costs somewhere to get its cheapest 5G phone down to that sub-$500 price point. As a result,this phone has an LCD screen, as opposed to the OLED panel similarly priced 5G phones features.Mind you, the Motorola One 5G’s 6.7-inch, full-HD screen boasts a 90Hz refresh rate for smoother animations and scrolling, and comes HDR10 certified to show a greater breadth of color and more detail within bright or dark scenes. However, LCD technology doesn’t power off pixels to show true blacks like OLED panels do, which, in turn, limits the vividity of images.Case in point: the trailer I watched for season two of The Mandalorian is flush with scenes of a dimly-lit, derelict street in the dark of night. On an OLED panel, the pitch-black sky would blend seamlessly into the bezels of the device, allowing the street lamps and graffiti-scrawled walls to stand out from the background. But the Motorola One 5G’s panel lacks that range, and so these moody setpieces end up looking somewhat muted.The Motorola One 5G fares better in the brighter moments, like in one part of the same Mandalorian trailer that sees an X-Wing carving through sun-kissed clouds. The HDR10 capability of this panel deftly paints a lush gradient of lavender, cream and gray. But in other scenes, even the most saturated hues don’t quite pop.Under our colorimeter, the Motorola One 5G peaked at 118.4% of the sRGB color space in its default profile, and achieved a respectable Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.25. (The closer to zero, the more accurate the colors.) That’s very close to the also LCD-powered iPhone SE, which reached 112.9% — though if you really prefer saturated hues, the AMOLED-equipped Galaxy A51 outshined both, with its 212.2% result. The Motorola phone’s maximum brightness topped out at 590 nits — better than the A51’s 565 nits, but far off the Pixel 4a’s 681 nits, or the iPhone SE’s 653 nits.It is worth pointing out that of all the devices I just mentioned, only the Motorola One 5G offers a 90Hz refresh rate. Faster refresh rates do indeed make phones feel a hair snappier, but personally, given the choice between a smoother display or an OLED one, I’d take the OLED option every time.You get many cameras with the Motorola One 5G. On the back, they take the form of a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens, 8MP ultrawide, 5MP macro, and 2MP depth sensor. On the front, you’ll find not one but two selfie shooters: a standard 8MP optic, coupled with a 16MP ultrawide for group shots, or to capture more of your surroundings.That’s six cameras across the front and the back, which is already slightly concerning, because phones at this price that tend to pack a plethora of optics rarely use any of them individually to any great effect. Unfortunately, the Motorola One 5G suffers from this quantity-over-quality problem.We start with the phone’s 48MP main lens, which seems impressive on paper until you consider that by default it churns out fairly-average looking 12MP shots that don’t benefit from that wealth of megapixels. I used this camera to snap a picture of a leafy limb extending off a pot of flowers, and the results are serviceable, albeit a bit washed out, overly bright and lacking fidelity in the highlights. The Pixel 4a’s 12.2MP rear camera doesn’t suffer this problem, delivering an exquisite shade of gold in one of the leaves and nailing the earthy hue of the rustic wooden floorboards in the background.I employed the same cameras again indoors, to get a sense of how the Motorola One 5G fares when light isn’t as readily available. Here, I was surprised to find the device hold its own; sure, the image it produces is darker overall than the Pixel’s, yet its colors are slightly more lush at the expense of some missing detail, particularly evident in the texture of the wood veneer on top of this desk. Nevertheless, not bad at all.I wish I could say the same for the performance of the Motorola One 5G’s ultrawide camera. This shot of a backyard is one of the poorest I’ve ever seen from any mobile ultrawide lens; everything is hazy and dark, and I have absolutely no idea what’s happened in the middle of the frame. It’s almost as if someone’s smudged the center of a still-drying Polaroid. It’s so poor, it makes the Galaxy A71 5G’s attempt look like it’s come from a device that costs twice as much, even though it’s only $150 more expensive.Motorola is very proud of the macro shooter on the Motorola One 5G, which even has its own ring flash that offers more direct illumination compared to a typical flash when you’re right up against a subject. Still, I’m not especially impressed by the quality of the macro camera itself, which struggled to focus compared to the macro shooter on the Galaxy A71 5G, while delivering less satisfying color overall. I’m also not sure if the inclusion of a macro lens will matter much to anyone at all; personally, I’d have much rather had a telephoto for optical zoom, even if it would have necessitated a price increase for the phone.Finally, we see a couple of selfies of yours truly, using the shallow depth-of-field portrait mode available on the Motorola One 5G and Galaxy A71 5G. Over the year’s I’ve noticed Motorola’s front-facing cameras tend to apply a slight yellowing to skin tones that I’ve never found flattering, though I suppose that’s not as serious a problem with this particular device. That said, I find the Galaxy’s rendition clearer, and its treatment of the bokeh around my shaggy hair more accurate.The Motorola One 5G carries the same Snapdragon 765 chipset that’s been making the rounds in various mid-range 5G Android phones throughout 2020, as well as 4GB of RAM.The 4GB of RAM would appear to be the weak link in this equation, as even your run-of-the-mill $500 Android handset tends to have at least 6GB these days. However, the Motorola One 5G has performed admirably in our testing, with no egregious instances of slowdown or lag.As with most other phones in this price range, you’re only likely to notice a lack in performance when playing games that are especially strenuous for the hardware. Titles like Asphalt 9 Legends run well enough, though a flagship device would certainly offer a smoother frame rate, sharper visuals and more plentiful graphical flourishes.The Motorola One 5G turned in a very respectable 1,952 points in the multi-core edition of the system-wide Geekbench 5 test. That’s actually four points better than the OnePlus Nord, which benefits from Snapdragon 765G silicon — basically the same chip as the 765 that Motorola’s using, but slightly overclocked.However, the 765G’s true appeal lies in its 20% faster graphics rendering compared to the stock chip, and it’s here that the Motorola One 5G comes up a bit short compared to the OnePlus Nord.In 3DMark’s Sling Shot OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test, Motorola’s handset achieved a score of 4,301, compared to the Nord’s 4,521. The Motorola One 5G was also outperformed by the Galaxy A71 5G in the GFX Bench Aztec Ruins Vulkan test for high-tier phones; here Motorola’s device topped out at 475 frames at 7.4 frames per second, compared to the A71’s 551 frames at 8.6 fps.At 5,000 mAh, the Motorola One 5G’s battery is quite large. However, this phone lasted a merely decent average time of 9 hours and 14 minutes across four trials of Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where devices are timed as they endlessly load web pages over a data connection until they run out of juice.That runtime is somewhat disappointing, considering the Motorola One 5G seems to have a lot of qualities that should’ve made it a better performer in our test. Aside from the huge battery, the display is LCD, and LCD panels tend to be less power hungry than OLED ones. Additionally, the pairing of Qualcomm’s efficient Snapdragon 765 chip, coupled with a frugal 4GB of RAM, should’ve meant better things for longevity.The Motorola One 5G doesn’t charge especially quickly either, with a meager 15W adapter included in the box. That got this device to 34% capacity after a half-hour of charging. A 15W brick might be sufficient for smaller phones with batteries that are half the size of the one inside Motorola’s mid-range 5G device, but here it’s woefully under-equipped for the task.The Motorola One 5G ships with Android 10 pre-installed, which is already out of date, now that Android 11 is out. This wouldn’t be particularly worrisome if not for the fact that Motorola is only guaranteeing one software update for this device, as it does with all its cheaper phones. In other words, once your Motorola One 5G hits Android 11, you’ll probably never see another major update, barring small patches and security enhancements.To add insult to injury, the Motorola One 5G is filled to the brim with bloatware. It’s been quite a while since I’ve used an AT&T-exclusive handset, and in that time I’d forgotten how much unwanted software floods the app drawers on these phones. While lots of these offending apps can be uninstalled, some, like Amazon Shopping, DC Universe and even Game Of Thrones: Conquest of all things can only be disabled — meaning they’ll still consume space on your device’s onboard memory, even if you never open them.I counted 31 examples of bloatware in total. And that’s not including the AT&T-branded services here, some of which are arguably frivolous. (There’s something called DriveMode, which is so visually sparse, it looks like it was whipped up in an hour.)Outside of these annoyances, Android 10 on the Motorola One 5G is pretty much your standard-fare Motorola experience, which is to say that it doesn’t exhibit many modifications to core Android, save for some extra gestural shortcuts and light enhancements. You have your chopping motion to fire up the flashlight and twisting motion for the camera, which have been present in almost every Motorola smartphone dating back to the start of the decade. There’s also a theming engine called My UX, which allows you to change system fonts, icons and the accent color, though it’s no different in practice from what Google started implementing in its Pixels last year.One new addition is Double Tap — a feature where you can literally double tap the Motorola One 5G’s side-mounted fingerprint sensor to call up six actions or apps of your choosing. It’s a handy feature to have, though how much utility you extract from it will likely differ on a user-by-user basis. In my case, I had to remind myself it was there at all.If you’re pining for a 5G phone for the absolute least amount of money and you happen to belong to AT&T or are willing to switch to get it, the Motorola One 5G is a decent phone. It performs well enough most of the time, and there’s nothing egregiously wrong with it.However, I struggle to see why anyone would settle for Motorola’s cheapest 5G phone when so many other, better options exist for slightly more money.The Samsung Galaxy A51 and A71 5G are far more well-rounded devices, with brighter, bolder displays and superior multi-lens camera systems. The OnePlus Nord (provided you can get it) is a performance champ for the money, offering up to 12GB of RAM and flagship-caliber smoothness. And the Pixel 4a 5G is likely to retain the Pixel 4a’s stellar software and flagship-caliber photography.Add it all up and the Motorola One 5G, with its bulky, tacky design and across-the-board mediocrity, feels like a phone that exists merely to satisfy a price bracket; nothing more, nothing less. And though it’s among the cheaper options, this isn’t a case of getting more than you pay for."
76,Samsung Galaxy Note 10,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-note-10,"Samsung built the Galaxy Note brand on delivering the best big-screen phones around, but the best thing about the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is how delightfully small it is.The 6.3-inch Note 10 is one of the most compact big-screen phones yet, thanks to its nearly bezel-free Infinity-O screen — and some features Samsung left on the cutting room floor. The Note 10 also boasts several S-Pen enhancements (including gestures), introduces helpful video recording features and a new way to mirror the phone on a PC. Although the $949/£869 Note 10 doesn't represent the pinnacle of Samsung's phablets, it should hit the sweet spot for most people in terms of size and specs. The idea of a compact phablet might sound crazy, but it actually makes a whole lot of sense when you use it.However, there are some trade-offs. You won’t find a headphone jack on the Note 10, and the microSD card slot is gone, too. The Note 10’s screen also isn’t as sharp as its predecessor's, though you'd be hard pressed to notice a difference between them.Today the Note 10 is still a great device, even with the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 now out. The new Note raises the screen size to 6.7 inches, making it potentially unsuitable to those interested in the Note 10 for its smaller footprint. It also features half the storage and no microSD slot for expandability. In other respects, the Note 20 seems like a worthy update; you can read our Samsung Galaxy Note 20 vs. Galaxy Note 10 face-off for a deeper explanation into how the two phones differ.Read on for our in-depth Samsung Galaxy Note 10 review.The Galaxy Note 10 is available for $949/£869, though we recommend you check out all the best Galaxy Note 10 deals out there before you decide where to buy. All of the major U.S. carriers are selling the Note 10, including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile.Samsung is currently offering an instant credit of $220 or more when you trade-in a device in good condition. Find out more details at Samsung.com.The Galaxy Note 10 is easily one of the most striking phones out there, especially if you go for the Aura Glow color. That model gives off a silvery iridescence that changes hues as light strikes it at different angles. You can also get it in Aura White, Aura Black and Aura Blue, with that last color exclusive to Best Buy and Samsung.com. Some regions receive additional colors, like Aura Red, that aren't available in North America.The most impressive thing about the Galaxy Note 10 is how it feels in your hand. At 6.3 inches, the Galaxy Note 10 has a slightly smaller screen than the 6.4-inch Galaxy Note 9, but it’s remarkably thinner and lighter. The Note 10 weighs just 5.9 ounces and is 5.9 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches thick, compared to a whopping 7.1 ounces and 6.3 x 3 x 0.34 inches for 2018's Galaxy Note 9.In fact, Samsung’s new phablet doesn't feel like a phablet at all when you hold it; it just feels normal. For a sense of perspective, the Note 10 is roughly two-tenths of an inch longer and a tenth wider than the Google Pixel 3 I regularly use, but packs a screen that's a whopping 0.8 inches larger from corner to corner.The result is a Note that is surprisingly comfortable to use one-handed. If you're especially mindful about owning a phone that slips easily into your pocket, or generally isn't cumbersome to live with, the Note 10 offers the biggest possible display in the smallest possible footprint right now. The steeply-sloped sides and miniscule bezels can occasionally yield unintentional touches at the edges of the display, though I generally found Samsung's palm rejection algorithm to be good at determining when I actually meant to interact with the device. Overall, there's little to be annoyed with here from a design perspective. For what it's worth, I don't like that the power button and volume controls are both on the left side of the phone; as I'm right-handed, I'd prefer them to be on the opposite side. Southpaws may be pleased, though perhaps Samsung could have split the difference and put some keys on the left and others on the right.Another minor gripe: depending on the color you get, the Note 10 can be a fingerprint super-magnet. Lots of handsets attract prints these days, but because the Aura Glow finish is literally that of a mirror with neat rainbow effects, if you look at the back of the phone from any perspective, smudges and smears are guaranteed to catch your eye. This is less true of the other colorways — the presence of a consistent hue can somewhat cloak that ugliness. But if you're the type of person that finds yourself frequently wiping your phone with a microfiber cloth, you're going to get a repetitive stress injury polishing the Aura Glow Note 10.Yes, the headphone jack is gone. Samsung ditched the 3.5-millimeter jack on both Note 10 models, as well as the microSD card slot on the smaller one in particular to achieve a sleeker design. On the plus side, Samsung is bundling AKG headphones in the box that use USB Type-C, and the Note 10 is at least still rated IP68 water-resistant, earning it a spot on our list of the best waterproof phones.Like Samsung's other recent premium handsets, the Note 10 has an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor baked into the display. The sensor is usually responsive and secure, though users have discovered that it can be easily fooled if certain third-party screen protectors have been applied to the device. A subsequent software update from Samsung reportedly fixes this issue, though it's something buyers may want to test themselves.The Galaxy Note 10 features a 6.3-inch Infinity-O display, which has a cutout located in the top center of the panel. Personally, I find the Note 10’s hole punch less distracting than the one on the Samsung Galaxy S10, which is on the right side.The cutout is most obvious when you’re using an app with a white background, as you'd expect, though the diameter of the Note's front-facing camera is smaller than that of the S10 or S10e. In other words, it's not nearly as obtrusive as it could be. In fact, after a while, you start to forget it's there.One downgrade from the Note 9 to the Note 10 concerns the quality of the screen. The Note 10’s Dynamic AMOLED display packs 2280x1080 pixels, compared to 3040x1440 panel in the Note 10 Plus. That said, the resolution decrease sounds worse than it is. I don’t think most people will notice a difference, and you still get the same great colors and HDR10+ certification as you do on the larger model.In terms of numbers, the Galaxy Note 10 offers one of the brightest and most accurate displays we've tested to date. At 674 nits of full-screen brightness, the Note 10's panel is just overshadowed by the Plus variant's 686 nits. The smaller device's screen still produces accurate colors, as evidenced by its 0.26 Delta-E score (numbers closer to zero are better). In Natural mode, the Note 10's screen covers a good swath of the sRGB spectrum at 125.1%. The Note 10 Plus delivered results of 0.25 and 124.6% in these categories, respectively. (As with all other Samsung phones, there's an optional Vivid color profile, too, if you prefer more saturated hues).But it's the brightness that makes all the difference. Cranked up to the highest setting, the Note 10's panel can illuminate details that would go unseen on other handsets' screens, while still maintaining the perfect blacks you'd expect from AMOLED technology. Watching the teaser trailer for El Camino, the Breaking Bad movie, some of the shadowy figures in the interrogation room were more clearly discernible on Samsung's display compared to when viewing the same clip on a Pixel 3.Ultimately, if you're after the sharpest display you can get, the 6.8-inch Note 10 Plus sports a higher pixel density of 498 pixels-per-inch, compared to 401 on this smaller model. Unfortunately, neither model has a 120Hz refresh rate like the OnePlus 8 Pro, so you miss out on silky-smooth animations and scrolling. That would have been nice to see; while the Note 10's screen is among the finest the industry has to offer right now, without that superfast refresh rate, it doesn't feel like much of a generational leap.The S Pen has gained some new tricks on the Galaxy Note 10 — though some of them come across as more gimmicky than useful.One of the S Pen's hallmark features has been the ability to convert handwriting to text. New for the Note 10, Samsung's OneUI software now offers a transcription-and-export option, that will allow you to save the note as text and send it to a Word doc, PDF or another file type, in one action. It's a clever feature, though much like the S Pen's other powerful transcription capabilities, it's somewhat convoluted to access.For example, if you scrawl out a Screen Off Memo or Quick Memo outside of the Samsung Notes app, you'll have to tap an on-screen button to move that document to the Notes app before you can start converting phrases and entire documents. Additionally, if you'd rather have handwriting-to-text conversion carried out as you write on the fly, you'll have to open the keyboard, swipe over to the keyboard page that offers additional features and tap another icon before you can begin writing with live transcription.While I appreciate that Samsung offers so many ways to use the S Pen to write, and while transcription works well in practice, the company desperately needs to make it easier to locate these features. Having to move a note I'm already taking to a separate app so I can edit and transcribe it creates a strange and unnecessary extra step. And I suspect when taking notes, most people would probably prefer live transcription, so burying that feature behind several layers of keyboard menus doesn't seem like the brightest idea either.Thankfully, you don’t have to apply nearly as much effort to use the new Air Actions gestures for the S Pen. For instance, you can change camera modes in the camera app just by swiping the stylus in the air while you press the button, and you can zoom in by making a circular motion with the S Pen. This worked, but it took some practice to get the hang of. As I discovered, you don't want to hold the button indefinitely — only when you're actively making the motion.The Note 10 could use properly-executed software to match its phenomenal hardware.At this point, it's difficult to imagine a scenario in which Air Actions would be especially beneficial, save for the classic tripod scenario. Samsung started opening up the S Pen SDK to developers last year, so there is an opportunity for Air Actions to flourish, if developers choose to take advantage of them. At the moment, though, the feature isn't even present in most of the Note 10's first-party software, so there's still lots of work to be done on Samsung's end.Last but not least, there’s a new AR Doodle feature that has the potential to create viral moments with your friends. Using the S Pen, you can draw on a live view of a subject or multiple subjects, and whatever you draw on them (a hat, mustache, etc.) will travel with them as they move about the frame.The AR Doodle feature is cute and yields silly results, as you can see in the above demo. Ultimately, though, it's one of those passing fads that wears thin pretty quickly. And while it's technically impressive, you'll have to be at least a decent artist if you want to get the most out of AR Doodle. Samsung decided to use the same camera sensors on the Galaxy Note 10 as on the Galaxy S10, which means you should not expect a leap in performance when taking still shots. Since the Note 10 came out in 2019, Samsung has launched the Galaxy S20 family, which features more advanced cameras, particularly on the high-end Galaxy S20 Ultra. A software update has brought some of the S20's camera features — such as Single Take, which captures a number of shots at once, and Night Hyperlapse capabilities — to the Galaxy Note 10.The back of the phone houses a triple-camera setup that includes a wide-angle 12MP shooter, an ultra-wide camera that takes 123-degree pics, and a 12MP telephoto lens that handles bokeh-effect portraits and offers 2x optical zoom. I say limited because phones like the Huawei P30 Pro already offer a 5x optical zoom using clever prism technology. The Galaxy Note 10 Plus offers a fourth sensor, a VGA depth camera that’s optimized for taking bokeh shots and better depth effects.The cameras inside the Note 10 are the same as those the Galaxy S10 series used, so we didn't expect to see photos that looked especially different from Samsung's previous flagships. The company's optics and image processing algorithms have always had a penchant for scenes that boost low-light visibility, often at the expense of dynamic range. In this pair of photos, taken within New York's Bryant Park, the Note 10 delivers a flatter-seeming image with better detail in the shadows, but less in the highlights compared to the Pixel 3.Heading a few blocks over to Times Square, we're met with a scenario that better plays to the Note 10's advantages. The strange green cast present in Samsung's Bryant Park shot is thankfully gone here. Instead, the Note 10 does a better job of exposing the entirety of the frame than the Pixel 3. Google's handset tends to prefer warmer, darker images, though in this case, the Pixel's lighting is much too dim compared to the actual conditions at the time. Still, I prefer the color Google's device pulls out of the clouds and sky.Looking out in the middle of a street in Brooklyn at dusk, the Note 10 appears to have been a little overwhelmed by its surroundings. There's a warm glow that pervades certain aspects of the shot, and a distinct lack of sharpness present in the trees, the texture of the asphalt and the cars that line the road. The Pixel 3's attempt here seems much more composed and consistent. It's important to point out here that neither device was tuned to night mode for this particular comparison.However, each phone's respective night mode was used for this pair of shots captured near Manhattan's Herald Square. Straight away, you can see that the Note 10's rendition is a bit warmer and softer in the same key areas, like the sides of buildings and texture of the street. Samsung's processing mitigates blowing out the highlights compared to Google's, although on the flip side, the Pixel 3 avoids the over-pronounced glow radiating from the overhead lamps. Again, Google's handset claims the sharper, more natural vibe here.  Finally, comparing the Note 10's Live Focus feature against the Pixel 3's shallow depth-of-field effects, it's clear to see Samsung still has work to do on the portrait front. While the deep shadows on my colleague Shaun's face lend an over-dramatic look to an otherwise well-lit indoor shot, the Note 10 goes much too far in the other direction, diminishing contrast to a fault. Shaun's hair, skin, t-shirt and tattoos all just come through so much more clearly through the Pixel's lens.Where Samsung hopes the Note 10 stands out is with its video prowess. The phone sports a Live Focus mode for video, which lets you blur the background and add special effects — like colorizing only the subject while keeping the background black and white.The new video features aren't quite professional grade as Samsung suggests, though they do work pretty well. Capturing video with blurred backgrounds lends a cheesy rom-com effect to video that isn't perfect (the bokeh fades in and out at times), but looks good enough for the small screen. And editing these clips is a breeze thanks to the S Pen and Samsung's redesigned video editor, which makes it easier to trim clips and perform other tasks with greater precision than using your finger alone.The Galaxy Note 10 is one of the fastest Android phones, thanks to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 CPU. It's not the newest mobile processor on the market, though it certainly delivers enough power for most people. The Galaxy Note 10 was one of a small group of phones (including the OnePlus 7 Pro) upon its launch to boast UFS 3.0 storage for snappier read and write speeds. You get 256GB of storage standard, complemented by 8GB of RAM; the Plus model packs 12GB of RAM. Truthfully, though 8GB is enough — the smaller Note 10 never stumbled during a week of use, whether I was gaming or writing, and never seemed wanting for more power.We ran our Samsung Galaxy Note 10 through Geekbench 4 and 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test, and were met with impressive — if not record-setting — results. In Geekbench, which measures overall system performance, the Note 10 turned in a result of 10,906. That's roughly 300 points behind the Note 10 Plus (which features 4GB more RAM), and 600 points behind the iPhone XS Max and its A12 Bionic chipset.The Note 10 performed better relative to the iPhone XS Max in 3DMark's graphics benchmark. There, the phablet notched a score of 5,374 — a full 1,000 points better than the 4,339 result from that iPhone, but a bit behind the iPhone 11 Pro Max's 5,392 score. However, other Android phones, including the Note 10 Plus (5,781), OnePlus 7 Pro (5,581) and even the Galaxy S10 Plus (5,648), all had it smoked.If you like the idea of using your Note 10 on a bigger screen, Samsung makes it easy with its upgraded DeX functionality. All you need is the provided USB Type-C cable that comes with the phone, as well as the DeX desktop app for your Windows PC or Mac, and you can run Android applications on your computer's display and manage your files through a phone-like interface, only on the big screen.The ability to use DeX without Samsung's dedicated DeX Station isn't new; the Galaxy Note 9 introduced support to run the software on an external display using a USB-C-to-HDMI cable. The prospect of transforming your Note into a makeshift workstation with nothing more than a cable seemed like a great addition to DeX's repertoire.In theory, being able to access DeX by plugging your Note 10 into your PC should expedite file management, which could be useful. However, our experience with the software wasn't as smooth as we hoped.Running DeX windowed on a PC is a somewhat laggy, low-quality experience, with strange limitations. For example, you currently can move files from your computer to your phablet by dragging them onto the DeX desktop, but not the other way around. Speaking of which, it's difficult to understand why someone would prefer to use DeX through their computer if they already have access to Windows or Mac to begin with.It's worth pointing out the Galaxy Note 20 has the ability to project DeX wirelessly to Miracast-supported displays. This feature will come to the Note 10 and Note 10 Plus as part of those phones' imminent One UI 2.5 updates, alongside some of the Note 10's other new S Pen and note-taking features. That presents another reason to get last year's model, if you can procure one at a compelling discount.With a capacity of 3,500mAh, the Galaxy Note 10's battery is smaller than both the Galaxy Note 9 (4,000mAh) and Galaxy Note 10 Plus (4,300mAh).In Tom's Guide's custom battery test, which forces the phone to endlessly load webpages on T-Mobile's LTE network at 150 nits of screen brightness, the Note 10 lasted for an average of 9 hours and 25 minutes across three sessions.Those times are well below the smartphone average of 10:14, not to mention the Note 10 Plus' 10:47 result over multiple tests — understandable, given that the Plus features an 800-mAh larger battery compared to the standard model. An earlier test of the regular Note 10's battery yielded a score of 14:33, due to an error in testing.The Note 10's current average of 9:25 is below what we've witnessed from other handsets, and well short of the best phone battery life we've seen, as the table below indicates.While roughly 9-and-a-half hours of battery life is not necessarily a deal-breaker, it does make the Note 10 a less compelling proposition, and gives those especially concerned about longevity on a charge a reason to spring for the Note 10 Plus instead.At least when it’s time to juice back up, you’ll be happy to know that the Note 10 ships with a 25-watt charger, which is the same that came in the box with the Galaxy S10 5G. In our testing, the Note 10 went from dead to 26% in 15 minutes, and hit 47% after a half hour. That's not too shabby, though the Note 10 Plus can achieve even faster speeds. Sometime in September, Samsung will begin selling an optional 45W charger that works exclusively with the Plus model, that promises to get you through the whole day after being plugged in for only 30 minutes. The Note 10 also features speedy 15W wireless charging, as well as the convenient Wireless Power Share feature pioneered by the Galaxy S10, so you’ll be able to charge other Qi-compatible phones and gadgets, like a pair of Galaxy Buds, using the back of the Note 10.Power users and spec heads will have a bone to pick with Samsung over the Galaxy Note 10. On paper, you're sacrificing the Note 9's larger screen, getting a smaller battery and losing both the headphone jack and microSD storage.So what’s left? An extremely svelte big-screen phone that offers faster performance, better cameras and new S Pen tricks. And while some will surely lament the omission of a memory card slot, 256GB of space built in is generous and arguably makes up for that slight.Those chasing the finest performance and largest display possible may flock to the 6.8-inch Galaxy Note 10 Plus or newer Note 20 Ultra, as they should. But for everyone else, the regular Note 10 should be a very special phablet — precisely because there's never been one this compact and easy to live with before.Oh, and one final note: At this point, prospective Note 10 buyers may want to take a look at the $999 Galaxy Note 20 and even more premium $1,299 Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. And now that the S Pen works with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, you could go that route, too, if you wanted.Samsung's latest phablets are more powerful, like you'd probably expect, with improved cameras. The Note 20 Ultra has the most notable new features all to itself, like its 120Hz dynamic refresh rate and 108MP primary camera and 5x optical zoom, though the cheaper Note 20 offers the same productivity suite without those bells and whistles to achieve a lower price.That said, what makes both new Notes great is the software more than anything else, and fortunately much of that is making its way over to the Note 10 series in the form of updates. The Note 10 is a fine device, but now it might be better to look at its successor or its Galaxy S cousins."
77,Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-10-pro-5g,"Xiaomi is a name that’s likely unfamiliar to many smartphone buyers in the West. The Chinese firm’s handsets have never been officially sold in the U.S. — the new Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G is no exception — and the full range of products the company offers typically don’t make it past Asia. But those who have heard of Xiaomi know that the company has earned a reputation for quality at a cut-rate price.Price: €999 (~$1,080, £870) OS: Android 10 with MIUI 11 Display: 6.67-inch OLED (2340x1080; 90 Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 865 RAM: 8GB Storage: 256GB; not expandable Rear camera: Quad-lens: 108MP wide (ƒ/1.7), 20MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2); 12MP “portrait” 2X telephoto (ƒ/2.0); 8MP 10X lossless telephoto (ƒ/2.0) Front camera: 20MP (ƒ/2.0) Battery: 4,500 mAh Size: 6.40 x 2.94 x 0.35 inches Weight: 7.34 ouncesRight off the bat, let’s make one thing clear: The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G is indeed a quality phone, but it’s not being sold at a cut-rate price. Last year’s Mi 9 Pro cost the rough equivalent of $520; the Mi 10 Pro 5G is priced at €999, which translates to $1,080. If OnePlus moved to a richer part of town by bumping its prices with the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro, then Xiaomi just bought a mansion.But the Mi 10 Pro 5G doesn’t feel like it came from a company that doesn’t know how to build an expensive, exquisite product. In fact, Xiaomi’s phone is every bit as polished and complete as the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus.However, it’s also not without its quirks. And even though it lasts remarkably long on a charge, has a beautiful display and takes a unique (and mostly successful) approach to camera hardware, the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s high price, difficulty to buy and overwrought software keep it from making our list of the best phones — very good though it is.The Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G isn’t sold in the U.S. or U.K., though it is available in Europe, where it costs €999 and only comes in one configuration with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. There is no microSD slot to expand storage on this device.Therefore, if you live in either the U.S. or U.K. and would like to own a Mi 10 Pro 5G, you’ll have to import an international model from a site like Giztop. As always with international models of phones, you’ll have to ensure the bands it can connect to align with those used by your carrier of choice.Our Mi 10 Pro 5G had no issues connecting to T-Mobile’s LTE network, though the device isn’t wired to receive every single band the Uncarrier utilizes. This may result in some lacking coverage in certain parts of the country. Additionally, while the Mi 10 Pro 5G supports sub-6GHz 5G, it couldn’t connect to T-Mobile’s nationwide 5G network during our testing, so we couldn’t enjoy the benefits of faster connectivity.While testing the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G, I frequently compared it against Samsung’s Galaxy S20 Plus. Both phones are sized similarly, cost about the same and sport an identical number of camera lenses on the back, so it seemed like an appropriate pairing, even if Samsung’s phone costs a little bit more. Our S20 Plus is of the Aura Blue variety, and Xiaomi calls the shade of our Mi 10 Pro 5G review unit Solstice Grey — which is odd, because it definitely comes across as blue to my eyes.Frequently I’d have both phones face up on my desk, and when I’d go to reach for one, oftentimes and much to my surprise, I’d mistakenly pick up the other. I often gripe that flagship smartphones these days all look the same, but the resemblance these devices share is unlike anything I’ve encountered before. The only immediate giveaway is that the Mi 10 Pro 5G is heavier than the S20 Plus by about seven-tenths of an ounce, which you can definitely feel.None of this is to say the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s design is disappointing, necessarily — just very familiar. It has that copycat aluminum frame you see on lots of Android flagships these days, that gets all thin in the middle and flares out as it approaches the top and bottom. You’ve got your two slabs of curved glass, with the one on the back bearing a pleasing matte finish, and a quartet of camera lenses broken into an unusual cluster — three lined in a pill-shaped module, and the ultrawide lens all by its lonesome quite a way down from the rest.That camera module is one of two of the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s only distinctive design traits. The other is its duplication of speakers. Not only will you see a set of drilled holes on the bottom, but there’s another along the top edge as well. Rather than using the earpiece for front-firing sound, the Mi 10 Pro 5G shoots audio out its sides when you’re holding the device in landscape orientation. And the speakers get awfully loud, too.But there’s a problem. When you’re gaming or watching a film, it’s only natural that your palms will cradle the phone at exactly both spots in which the stereo speakers sit. This isn’t an issue for devices that place one driver behind the earpiece and another in the frame. But when both are housed in the frame, then you have a bit of a dilemma. There were numerous occasions in which I was playing Fortnite on the Mi 10 Pro 5G and tightened up my grip for a firefight only to have the phone sound like it had immediately plunged to the bottom of a pool.Oh, and speaking of pools, here’s something else: The Mi 10 Pro 5G, despite its four-digit sticker shock, doesn’t boast any IP rating for water resistance. All you get is a liquid-repellent nano-coating that might fend off some rain or a spilled drink, but isn’t going to save your phone from a dive. One of the best waterproof phones this is not.It’s becoming increasingly common to see fast refresh-rate displays in flagship phones, and the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G follows that trend with a 90Hz, full-HD AMOLED panel that delivers smooth animations and either realistic or robust colors, depending on the display profile you select.The Mi 10 Pro 5G’s screen might not quite match the 120Hz refresh rates and quad-HD resolutions of the Galaxy S20 series and the OnePlus 8 Pro, though I don’t consider that a loss worth pining over. Animations at 90Hz are still far more fluid than what you get from conventional 60Hz displays, and make the entire experience of using the phone tangibly more immediate and responsive. More pixels and faster refresh rates also exert an adverse affect on battery life, and the Mi 10 Pro 5G happens to last very long on a charge — but more on that later.I was dazzled by the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G’s screen while watching the latest trailer for the upcoming James Bond flick, No Time To Die. Bond’s stunt-driving antics wheeling an Aston Martin DB5 through the sun-kissed Italian town of Matera looked especially dramatic thanks to the panel’s excellent dynamic range.But the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s display can get awfully bright too, with a peak full-screen brightness of exactly 800 nits. That’s just shy of the Galaxy S20 Plus’ 847 nits, though I was hard pressed to notice a difference in visibility between both devices while using them outside on a sunny day.The Mi 10 Pro 5G sports a range of display modes, from Original — which is more natural and tuned to the sRGB color space — to the more vivacious Saturated mode that lifts those hues into the stratosphere.The default Auto mode, which is somewhere in between, delivers a picture that compares nicely with what the OnePlus 8 Pro offers; with this configuration, the Mi 10 Pro 5G rendered 109.6% of the DCI-P3 color space, compared to the slightly bolder 116.9% of the premium OnePlus handset. However, the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s colors do appear to be slightly more accurate, as it notched a 0.22 score in the Delta-E test, where numbers closer to zero are better. The OnePlus 8 Pro finished at 0.26.Samsung’s 108-megapixel camera sensor is reaching more models from other phone makers. Not only is it featured in the quad-lens Motorola Edge Plus, but it also headlines the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G’s four-lens stack.Xiaomi has flanked that super-high-resolution shooter with three other lenses: a 20-MP ultrawide optic, and, strangely, two telephoto cameras. One is rated at 12 MP and touts 2x optical power, and is used for shallow depth-of-field portraits; the other captures 8 MP shots but can see further, with up to 10x lossless zoom. A 20-MP selfie camera rounds out the repertoire. If you leave that main 108-MP sensor to its own devices, it’ll capture binned 27-MP shots that allow more light to reach the sensor. The results are good, but not perfect; if you look closely, you’ll notice the wood fibers at the center of the torch are a bit blurry, and not quite in focus. The Galaxy S20 Plus didn’t suffer the same issues getting everything in the middle of the frame all nice and crisp, and avoided the smoky, warm cast over the background as well.But if you ratchet the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s main shooter up to 108 MP, it can take some pretty remarkable images you can just keep zooming into for days. This suburban scene may not look particularly exciting, but I have to stress that in this instance, Xiaomi’s device nailed the white balance, reflecting the somewhat cloudy conditions of the afternoon. The S20 Plus — which was set to its full-resolution 64MP mode for this shot — delivered a very sharp result, though the contrast is a bit too dramatic and the sky more of an idyllic blue than it really was in actuality.The Mi 10 Pro 5G’s ultrawide optic delivered a less praiseworthy result, clearly suffering some distortion at the fringes and sucking all the depth out of the shadows. The boosted colors in both shots are owing to the fact that both handsets’ AI scene optimization modes were turned on. And while the Galaxy’s version of events isn’t perfect either — the trees have a very eerie glow to them — the more natural saturation and contrast from Samsung’s phones earns the S20 Plus the thumbs up.That ultrawide optic is the same one the Mi 10 Pro 5G employs to capture macro shots. My colleague Philip Michaels isn’t a fan of dedicated macro lenses, and my sentiments echo his. However, the Mi 10 Pro 5G is different from most macro-enabled phones. Because the camera responsible for those hyper-close shots also serves double duty for ultrawide photos, I don’t mind Xiaomi’s inclusion of a macro mode here. In fact, I’m decently pleased with the intricate texture the Mi 10 Pro 5G can convey in the leaf in the example above, using that special lens.Overall, though, I came away far more impressed by the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s zoom camera, which uses a hybrid of optical power and software to deliver what Xiaomi calls “lossless” 10x zoom. Both shots of a street sign you see above were captured using 10x zoom on the Mi 10 Pro 5G and the Galaxy S20 Plus, but the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s example is noticeably more detailed, with better color and sharpness. Xiaomi’s phone is able to capture the paint chipping away from the sign within the letters — a detail Samsung’s flagship misses. I wouldn’t consider either “lossless,"" though it's still impressive.To test the other telephoto lens on the Mi 10 Pro 5G — the one used for portraits and bokeh shots — I asked a friendly bear to smile for the camera. The Mi 10 Pro 5G excelled here as well, churning out a brighter image that more accurately separated the foreground from the background, and crisply rendered our stuffed friend’s fur. The Galaxy S20 Plus applied some blur to his ears and totally blew out the light from the window in the distance — a detail Xiaomi’s camera navigated better.When things get dark, you’d probably expect to turn to the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s Night Mode to inject some light and detail into dim scenes. Unfortunately, that’s not exactly what happened when I snapped a photo of a fireplace in an otherwise pitch-black room. The way Xiaomi’s software selectively applies color — like how the fire enveloping the embers below is blue, but the large flames above are off-white — is admittedly captivating, though hardly realistic. And while the S20 Plus’ take isn’t perfect either — it’s generally noisier and washed out in places — at least its fire feels warm and inviting, and not quite so spooky.The combination of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 system-on-chip and the 8GB of fast LPDDR5 RAM in the Mi 10 Pro 5G ensures a speedy and fluid user experience, whether playing games or just swiping around Android.Unsurprisingly, the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s performance is right in line with rival handsets that pack similar hardware. In Geekbench 5, a test that measures overall system performance, the Mi 10 Pro 5G delivered a multi-core result of 3,300 points, which compares well to the OnePlus 8 Pro (3,379) and Galaxy S20 Plus (3,076). The A13 Bionic chip in the iPhone 11 Pro (3,509) remains the performance champ.Turning to graphics performance, the Mi 10 Pro 5G produced 1,294 frames at 20 frames-per-second in GFXBench’s Aztec Ruins OpenGL test for high-tier phones. That result is dead even with the OnePlus 8 Pro (20 fps) and a tick behind the Galaxy S20 Plus (21 fps). Indeed, the Mi 10 Pro 5G handles demanding titles like Fortnite about as well as any other phone; you might observe a handful of dropped frames here and there at full resolution, but the experience is largely consistent, smooth and pretty.Smartphone batteries are getting bigger and bigger all the time, and so there’s seemingly nothing special about the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s 4,500-mAh pack — until you witness how long it lasts on a charge.Xiaomi’s flagship averaged an extremely impressive 13 hours and 29 minutes on Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, which measures runtime while streaming websites endlessly over an LTE network. That result was compiled over four tests, with the phone set to 60Hz mode for maximum efficiency.That isn’t just better than Sansung’s latest flagships — it mercilessly trounces them. The similarly-priced Galaxy S20 has a battery that is 500 mAh smaller, but clocked just 9:31 — four hours less than the Xiaomi. The S20 Plus, which has a battery with identical capacity to the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s, barely fared any better, at 10 hours and 31 minutes. Even the OnePlus 8 Pro, one of our best Android phones, managed 11 hours and 5 minutes. That’s still awfully good, but incomparable to the Mi 10 Pro 5G which ranks high among the devices with the best phone battery life.Xiaomi packs a 65-watt fast charger in box with the Mi 10 Pro 5G, yet the phone only supports a maximum of 50 watts. That’s a bit strange, but regardless the company claims that users should see the battery gauge go from empty to 100% in just 45 minutes. Unfortunately, given that our model shipped with an EU charger, we’re unable to verify that claim. For what it’s worth, the Mi 10 Pro 5G can also top up wirelessly at 30 watts, which equals the wireless charging speed of the OnePlus 8 Pro.For those who have never used a Xiaomi phone before, the company’s MIUI interface is a bit of a surprise when you first begin poking around. The Mi 10 Pro 5G comes with Android 10 out of the box, though it also has MIUI version 11 installed over top of it, which makes for an experience that is as far away from stock Android as what you’ll find in any Android phone.For one, there’s no app drawer, and so a swipe up from the shortcuts tray on your home screen brings up a page within Xiaomi’s custom browser featuring a Google Search bar and various YouTube videos and news stories the phone thinks you may find useful. The recent apps screen has a tiled look to it, rather than the cards stacked sideways that you may be more familiar with from iOS and conventional Android. On that screen, you’ll also find options to either “clean” or “deep clean” your Mi 10 Pro 5G, which seems a little redundant.Speaking of redundancy, there are quite a lot of tools on the Mi 10 Pro 5G dedicated to phone maintenance. Aside from those two tools, you also have RAM Jet, which, as far as I can tell, just plays a little animation of a rocket ship every time you worry a greedy background app might be hogging memory on your device. There’s even a Mi Community app, where you can offer advice or pose questions to other users, and keep up on the latest news surrounding Xiaomi’s phones.The focus on optimization feels a bit frivolous given that modern phone operating systems are already quite good at prioritizing tasks and taking care of all the back-end stuff so users don’t have to. Nevertheless, I can excuse that window dressing. What’s less excusable is the bloatware that the Mi 10 Pro 5G sports from the moment you boot it up for the first time, which is unexpected for an unlocked phone.There are five games, all of which are ad-supported: Block Puzzle Guardian, Crazy Juicer, Dust Settle, Bubble Story and the hilariously-named Bubble Shooter With Friends. And in the More Apps folder, you’ll find Facebook, WPS Office, Netflix and LinkedIn. Usually, when you pay $1,000 for a phone directly from a manufacturer, you aren’t forced to do spring cleaning from day one, and so the Mi 10 Pro 5G regrettably feels a bit more like a subsidized budget handset in that sense.The software on Xiaomi’s phone merits two points of praise: First, the Mi 10 Pro 5G’s haptics are surprisingly quite nice. The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor works quite well, but my favorite thing about it is actually the “hummm-pop” that happens as you authenticate, which offers a pleasing bit of feedback every time you unlock your Mi 10 Pro 5G. I also enjoy the feedback when typing, which evokes the excellent keyboard haptics on Google’s Pixel 4.Second, it should be noted that Xiaomi’s flagship is one of an endangered species of handsets in the modern era to feature an IR blaster, meaning you can use it as a universal remote for just about any television. It’s a really neat inclusion you don’t often see anymore, and allows the Mi 10 Pro 5G to easily rank among our admittedly short list of the best phones with IR blasters.If the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G were easy to purchase all around the world, I’d recommend it as a no-brainer Samsung Galaxy S20 alternative for anyone concerned about battery life. Not only does the Mi 10 Pro 5G look like Samsung’s flagship, but its cameras, display and performance are comparable, too. There isn’t much buyers will give up here; in fact, they only stand to gain hours and hours on a charge.But that caveat — ease of purchase — is why the Mi 10 Pro 5G is not a device we can wholeheartedly recommend to everyone reading this review. On its merits alone, this is indeed a very good flagship phone, and one of the best Android phones of the year. But importing one if you live outside Europe or Asia is risky, given that the device doesn’t support all the necessary bands carriers use west of the Atlantic. And even if the Mi 10 Pro does connect to your network’s towers, 5G support is sure to be spotty, given the emerging nature of those networks and the fact that different carriers employ different bands for those connections, too.It also doesn't help Xiaomi's case that a string of reasonably-priced premium phones, like the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE and OnePlus 8T, are on the horizon and look to beat the Mi 10 Pro 5G from a performance-per-dollar standpoint.And so, the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro 5G ends up feeling like a great phone without a good home, at least for prospective customers in the Americas and the U.K. However, if you reside in a place where the Mi 10 Pro 5G is guaranteed to work as designed — or better yet is officially sold — you shouldn’t hesitate to buy one. It really is that good."
78,Motorola Edge Plus,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-edge-plus,"The Motorola Edge Plus feels like a statement of intent from a company that has everything to prove when it comes to high-end phones. After several years of staying out of the flagship phone arms race — all the while committed to churning out very respectable-albeit-uninspiring budget devices — the company is finally delivering a $1,000 phone that it believes will take the fight to the Samsung Galaxy S20, OnePlus 8 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro.To Motorola’s credit, the Motorola Edge Plus seems to have pretty much everything you could ask for in a flagship phone in 2020, between its wraparound 6.7-inch, 90-Hz OLED display, gigantic 5,000-mAh battery and quad-lens camera array that even borrows the Galaxy S20 Ultra’s 108-megapixel primary shooter. It’s also a Verizon exclusive, in true Motorola fashion. That always stings, but it’s especially painful this time around, because the Edge Plus is the most exciting handset to come out of the Chicago-based phone maker in a long time.Excitement alone doesn’t earn any phone a recommendation. And while there are certainly aspects to like about this device, as you’ll find in our Motorola Edge Plus review, there are other flagships out there that present a more complete package, deliver more for less or can be used on any carrier of your choice. Good though the Edge Plus is, it’s not quite up the standards set by the best phones.The Motorola Edge Plus costs $999. Like so many of its Droid-branded predecessors, it will be exclusive to Verizon’s network in the U.S. Motorola also sells a cheaper model, just called the Motorola Edge, that's now available unlocked and on other carriers. However, that phone swaps out the Edge Plus’ Snapdragon 865 processor for a lower-spec Snapdragon 765 CPU, and make some other specs concessions to achieve its lower $699 price. The cheaper Motorola Edge can still connect to 5G networks, though.Price: $999 OS: Android 10 Display: 6.7-inch OLED (2340x1080; 90 Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 865 RAM: 12GB Storage: 256GB; expandable Rear camera: Quad-lens: 108MP wide (ƒ/1.8), 16MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2), 8MP 3x telephoto (ƒ/2.4), time-of-flight VGA Front camera: 25MP (ƒ/2.0) Battery: 5,000 mAh Carriers: Verizon only 5G: Sub 6-GHz, mmWave Size: 6.34 x 2.81 x 0.37 inches Weight: 7.16 ouncesAs for the Edge Plus, it comes in one configuration, with 256GB of UFS 3.0 storage and 12GB of superfast LPDDR5 RAM. Both of those specs equal the OnePlus 8 Pro, which costs $100 less than the Edge Plus will. But since the Edge Plus will be offered by Verizon, Motorola’s phone has been developed to support the full range of Big Red’s network, including its high-speed millimeter-wave 5G infrastructure — something the OnePlus 8 Pro cannot claim.The name of Motorola’s new flagship is derived from its display, and it’s that display that informs most of the Edge Plus’ design. Motorola has dubbed this an “Endless Edge” panel, because it curves a full 90 degrees around the left and right sides of the phone. It’s sort of like the screen on the new OnePlus 8 Pro, except more extreme.In fact, the curve on this display is the most dramatic we’ve ever seen, on any phone. Holding the Edge Plus in your hand, you begin to worry about inadvertently interacting with the screen when you don’t mean to. Fortunately, Motorola has tuned the palm-rejection software well enough that I didn’t find myself accidentally triggering items on the fringes of the screen.That’s a good start then — but is the curve actually useful? That’s a tougher question to answer. Phone makers have been experimenting with curved panels for a long time, though the benefits have never been clear. The Edge Plus utilizes the sides of its display for two purposes: as a place to stash additional shortcuts, and to convey battery status and notifications visually, particularly when the screen is off.The shortcuts are handy, though hardly game changing. This feature, called Swipe In, works exactly how it says on the tin — you swipe inward on a tab along the right side, and six tasks or apps show up. You can customize this list how you like, and to Motorola’s credit, it’s much more responsive and easier to trigger than Sony’s infuriating Side Sense functionality on its Xperia devices, which is supposed to work in a similar fashion yet fails about half the time.Curve aside, though, the Edge Plus is actually a very distinctive-looking flagship. Between its sharp corners, super-narrow 21:9 proportions and prominent pill-shaped rear camera module, there’s never really been a Motorola phone like it before. It sort of resembles the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus, except taller and chunkier, owing to its larger battery. The Edge Plus is a hair heavier than Samsung’s phablet too, by about a quarter of an ounce.I’d hesitate to call the Edge Plus elegant, though. Our review unit is Thunder Grey — though it’s really more of a steel blue hue — and looks nice enough from the back. But the super-thin frame sandwiched between the two glass panels is painted a glossy black, which is more evocative of cheaper handsets and doesn’t really mesh with the satiny cool luster of the rear.Along the top and bottom, the frame flares out and bows in down the middle in an unusual way. Weirdly, Motorola shoehorned all the regulatory labels, like the phone’s model number and CE logo, into that lower part of the frame between the SIM card tray, speaker grille and USB Type-C port. It’s almost like they forgot to include them and were forced by law to scramble and etch them in at the last minute.One final point on the Edge Plus’ design, and it’s a downer: Motorola has neglected to make this device IP-certified water resistant, which is actually pretty rare these days. Nearly all high-end models from all the major phone makers can be submerged without damage, but the Edge Plus only boasts protection against spills and splashes.High refresh-rate, full-HD OLED displays have gone from a luxury to the status quo for Android flagships. The Motorola Edge Plus falls in lockstep with that trend, thanks to a 90Hz panel that offers fluid scrolling and increased responsiveness to taps and gestures.In terms of smoothness, 90Hz is better than the 60Hz of traditional displays, but not quite as slick as the 120Hz offered by the Galaxy S20 line and OnePlus 8 Pro. The Google Pixel 4 and the regular OnePlus 8 also tout 90Hz panels.The Motorola Edge Plus features a big screen, though it conceals its size well. Technically, it measures 6.7 inches from corner to corner — which seems quite unwieldy, until you factor in the curves on either side, and the narrow 21:9 aspect ratio, both of which improve ease of use with one hand.The Edge Plus’ panel is a pretty one too, even if it’s not among the brightest we’ve tested. The screen in Motorola’s flagship peaked at 550 nits under our light meter. That’s decent, though it’s several hundred nits less than what Moto’s fiercest rivals offer, like the iPhone 11 Pro (752 nits) or the Galaxy S20 (857 nits).When it comes to general display quality and color, though, the Edge Plus is on point. Watching the trailer for F9, the upcoming Fast & Furious film, I remarked at the lush greens and clouds of uprooted earth as Jakob Toretto — John Cena’s character — bounded his Shelby Mustang across a tropical forest and off a mountain cliff. The cinematic aspect ratio made the clip especially captivating, because it immersed the action in a wider context, with Toretto’s pony car looking so small amidst the dust, debris and explosions flying about from every direction. The Edge Plus’ display is an ideal one for watching movies.Motorola’s flagship rendered 134.5% of the DCI-P3 color space on its default Saturated setting, which sits it between the OnePlus 8 Pro (116.9%) and Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus (162.5%). If you’re looking for more realistic color, there are Boosted and Natural options as well, with the latter tuned to deliver sRGB coverage.Bold as the Edge Plus’ hues are, it’s not the most accurate panel we’ve tested in terms of color reproduction. While set to its most-lifelike Natural profile, the best the phone could offer in our Delta-E test was a 0.29 result. In this particular benchmark, numbers closer to zero are preferred, and the OnePlus 8 Pro (0.26) and iPhone 11 Pro (0.28) fared slightly better, while the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus actually lagged behind the pack (0.36).Motorola has never been particularly renowned for its cameras, but the Edge Plus looks to change that reputation for the better. Motorola makes the effort with a quad-lens rear camera system that interestingly utilizes the very same 108MP sensor found in the $1,399 Galaxy S20 Ultra. Here, though, you can have it in a device that costs $400 less.As for the other cameras on the Edge Plus, they comprise an 8MP telephoto capable of 3x optical zoom, a 16MP ultrawide lens and a time-of-flight depth sensor, which is inconspicuous hiding in the strip adjacent to the flash.Motorola is very proud of what the Edge Plus can accomplish with that main 108MP optic, though. Like a few of the company’s past phones, the Edge Plus utilizes quad-pixel binning, which in this case results in 27-MP shots with optimal exposure and dynamic range that should be especially useful in low light. While the 108MP option is always available to you, more often than not you’re better off sticking with the default option to benefit from all of Motorola’s computational photography tricks, unless you really need those thousands of extra pixels for cropping after the fact.The Edge Plus’ photos are generally good, but sometimes exhibit a narrow range of focus. In capturing the wreath of flowers you see above, Motorola’s camera ever so slightly blurs some of the petals at the perimeter. While I like the added clarity the Edge Plus lends to the darker, more shadowy portions of the image, its rendition unfortunately lacks the vivid hues — particularly the lush lavender — present in the iPhone 11 Pro’s shot.The Edge Plus can suffer from trouble dealing with highlights, as this shallow depth-of-field portrait demonstrates. While the image overall is quite good — and I actually like that Motorola’s software subtly dims the background, to allow the model to stand out more — the sunlight is totally blown out, and particular details, like the fabric of the woman’s shirt, are fuzzier.In comparing ultrawide photos between Motorola and Apple’s flagships, it’s easy to see that the Edge Plus’ zoomed-out shooter sports a narrower field-of-view than the one inside the iPhone 11 Pro’s. There are certain advantages to this, as the line of trees in the distance is generally sharper through the Edge Plus’ lens, compared to the iPhone’s. But if the purpose of an ultrawide vantage point is to really pull back as far as you can, the iPhone’s optic is more useful. Additionally, the white balance of the Edge Plus’ shot is a tinge too warm, and Motorola’s flagship seemed to have a bit more trouble resolving those brighter, blown out areas of the image, like the side of the shed to the right.I came away more impressed by the Edge Plus’ rendition of this image of a tree from a distance on a cloudy day, taken with its 3x optical lens. While the Galaxy S20 Plus’ lighting is probably a bit more accurate, I prefer just about everything else in the Edge Plus’ attempt. The tree is much sharper and brighter, with slightly punchier colors that catch the eye without venturing into oversaturation. The details on the house in the background are more precise as well, and there’s less of a blur when you peer in on the street sign to the right.However, when I used the same two phones to cut in close on a pair of model cars, the Edge Plus’ shot turned out to be a bit of a let down. While Samsung’s algorithms have a known tendency to over-sharpen images and heavily bolden edges, at least the S20 Plus’ version of things is in focus. The Edge Plus got the colors right, but everything else turned out to be a smeary mess, with a haze applied to blown-out regions of the frame despite the fact tap-to-focus was used in both instances.It’s a shame, because sometimes, the Edge Plus can pick up phenomenal detail. The ultrawide lens doubles as a macro shooter when used with the corresponding mode, and it can churn out some pretty impressive results, like this dive into a leaf. Look at the way the plant’s texture catches and manipulates light at the granular level, and those drops of dew sitting delicately in place to the right. I’m not usually one to take advantage of macro modes in phone cameras, but the Edge Plus has made me want to experiment with them.Motorola’s Night Vision mode is pretty decent as well, to its credit. The Pixel 4 is my favorite low-light shooter, but I think I’m more pleased with the way the Edge Plus captured this cozy fireplace scene. The Pixel 4’s attempt is brighter overall, but the Edge Plus’ shot is much sharper — something you especially see in the links of the chain mesh, the embers below and the bricks inside. On the other hand, there’s a warmth and color to the way Google’s software painted this scene that I miss in the Edge Plus’ version, though it’s not a huge loss.Finally, we turn to the Edge Plus 25MP front-facing camera, which also incorporates quad-pixel binning to let as much light in as possible. In spite of that, though, I’m more pleased with the iPhone 11 Pro’s self-portrait. It’s sharper, my winter hat is clearly more in focus, and my skin tone, the shadows and the color overall is simply more natural across the board. Looking at my Edge Plus selfie long enough, I start to worry I might have jaundice.The Edge Plus offers the ability to capture 20MP stills as you’re recording from the main camera, and the company promises the resulting shots aren’t compressed screenshots of recorded videos — rather, they’re full-resolution images that rival what you’d be able to get if you were snapping photos under normal circumstances. In our testing, we found that to be true; while the video snapshots had slightly more grain to them, the dynamic range and detail was comparable to an identical photo snapped normally.You’ll find a curious-yet-welcome feature along the top of the Edge Plus: a headphone jack. Motorola says it brought the 3.5-millimeter port back due to consumer feedback. That’s commendable, considering most phone makers that have ditched the jack in their high-end models haven’t gone back on their decisions.Even if you don’t take advantage of that audio port, though, Motorola says it poured lots of attention into the Edge Plus’ stereo speakers to make them the loudest ever in a smartphone — and you can tell. This phone gets exceptionally loud, putting the iPhone 11 Pro to shame in terms of volume while also offering a bit more low-end oomph.Some songs, like Death Cab for Cutie’s classic, “For What Reason,” definitely allow that sense of warmth and added richness to shine. The guitars in that track occasionally sound like they’ve been submerged underwater — a style that most handsets often fail to convey, with their tinny speakers. The Edge Plus plunges those licks deeper into the pool, while allowing vocalist Ben Gibbard’s chorus to soar ever higher.Other times, the Edge Plus’ audio advantages are more subtle. Listening to Madvillian’s “Raid,” the jazzy piano, hissing cymbals and MF Doom’s crisp verses benefit from a live presence you probably wouldn’t expect from phone speakers — yet that track is so well produced, it already sounds phenomenal on just about anything.The Edge Plus owes its expert tuning to a company called Waves Audio, which Motorola tasked to ensure the quality of the phone’s sound could match its loudness. Waves has done an excellent job. And while I personally think most smartphone buyers especially concerned about audio quality should turn to one of the best Bluetooth speakers when they want to enjoy their tunes, the power of the Edge Plus’ drivers ensure you won’t feel totally helpless without your listening device of choice.Like many other Android flagships, the Edge Plus benefits from Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 power. With 12GB of speedy LPDDR5 RAM, we expected this phone would fly, and fly it does.Asphalt 9 Legends is a popular mobile racing game we often play during most of our phone reviews here at Tom’s Guide. That’s both because it’s one of the most graphically demanding titles on both Android and iOS, and because, in my experience, no phone has ever run it flawlessly. Even flagships suffer the odd dropped frame here or there, but the Edge Plus might be the first to pass the test with flying colors. In one race in the Himalayas, falling rock and debris tumbles into the road as you’re driving; I don’t ever recall that particular environmental hazard unfolding quite as smoothly — without no framerate hit to speak of — as it does on Moto’s new flagship.In the system-wide multicore Geekbench 5 test, the Edge Plus delivered a score of 3,350 points, landing just behind the OnePlus 8 Pro (3,379) and a bit further behind the iPhone 11 Pro (3,517). Additionally, in the OpenGL version of GFXBench’s Aztec Ruins graphic test for high-tier devices, the Edge Plus notched a respectable 20 frames per second, which was dead even with the performance of OnePlus’ flagship.As a real-world test, we task devices with converting a short 4K video to 1080p using Adobe’s Premiere Rush app, and then clock the time spent to finish the job. It took 1 minute and 32 seconds for the Edge Plus to turn that clip around, which happened to be 11 seconds less time than the OnePlus 8 Pro needed, with its 8GB of RAM to the Edge Plus’ 12GB. The iPhone 11 Pro, however, smoked both devices (as it typically does in this test), requiring only 45 seconds to transcode the very same file.The Edge Plus’ performance story, then, is encouraging but also predictable, given the processor inside and all the memory Motorola supplied that silicon with. What’s more interesting is the work the company has done on the 5G side of things.Motorola claims the Edge Plus is the fastest 5G phone in the world, thanks to a unique antenna array and clever tuning by the company’s engineers. It is a somewhat vague claim, it has to be said, as the company doesn’t cite live data speed comparisons against other 5G phones to support that assertion.For what it’s worth, Motorola says the Edge Plus was able to record just over 4 Gbps downlink in a “simulated” 5G mmWave environment, though current 5G networks cannot deliver that kind of performance today. Additionally, because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the limited range of mmWave networks, we’re not in a position to test the Edge Plus’ fastest download speeds against a competitor, like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus.The Edge Plus will also support Verizon’s sub-6GHz 5G bands, as Verizon expands its 5G coverage later this year.Sized at 5,000 mAh, the battery inside the Edge Plus is one of the largest you’ll find in any phone today. To put that into perspective, it’s 500 mAh larger than the batteries the OnePlus 8 Pro and Galaxy S20 Plus use, and equal in capacity to the battery inside the considerably more expensive Galaxy S20 Ultra.Of course, the Edge Plus packs no shortage of power-draining features and hardware, between its speedy processor, mmWave radio and that fast-refresh, high-resolution display. In other words, even despite that beefy battery, this isn’t the longest-lasting phone on a charge — though it should still last long enough for most people.Motorola’s flagship averaged a time of 10 hours and 55 minutes in Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where phones endlessly load a series of web pages over a data connection until they run out of juice. The Edge Plus ran the test a total of three times while set to its 60-Hz display mode for the best possible result.Nearly 11 hours is very good, though not quite the best we’ve seen in this price range. The aforementioned OnePlus 8 Pro actually fared slightly better, pulling out an 11-hour, 5-minute average, likely on account of the fact it has less RAM to power and doesn’t connect to mmWave networks. A better comparison would likely be the Galaxy S20 Plus, whose 10:31 average the Edge Plus still topped by roughly half an hour.When it’s time to juice back up, Edge Plus buyers will be pleased to know there’s both wireless and wired charging onboard, though the wired “fast” charging system only tops out at 18 watts. That’s nearly half the wattage of the OnePlus 8 Pro’s wired and wireless Warp Charge systems, and well below the 25-watt adapters Samsung ships with its flagships.But, of course, a big battery needs an appropriately fast charging solution, and the Edge Plus plainly doesn’t have one. Motorola’s phone reached just 28% from empty after 30 minutes using the stock brick. Over that same timeframe, the OnePlus 8 Pro reached 63%. The Edge Plus isn’t a cheap device, but Motorola certainly cheaped out on the packaged adapter — or at least it didn’t do the math.Motorola has never really taken excessive liberties with modifying stock Android, and that’s largely true of the Edge Plus as well. The company has advertised a new software initiative beginning with this device, titled My UX, that allows users to customize visual aspects of their experience, like fonts and icons — though it’s largely based upon the theming engine that’s already baked into Android 10.That’s probably for the better, though, as what few touches Motorola has exerted on Google’s operating system tend to be generally useful. There are the aforementioned audio enhancements, as well the Moto app that the phone maker loads onto all its devices, offering optional physical shortcuts to quick-launch the camera and flashlight. You don’t have to use them if you don’t want to, and they never get in the way.Motorola has opted for an optical fingerprint sensor for authentication on the Edge Plus, and it works well. It’s not the fastest scan in the world, but I didn’t find it to be especially picky about orientation or pressure, and I didn’t experience many false negatives during my time with the phone. There’s actually a nice haptic “pop” that occurs when unlocking the Edge Plus, and it must be said that this device’s haptics are very pleasing overall, especially when typing.The Edge Plus defaults to an unusual live wallpaper, depicting rolling waves from a top-down view as you scroll through home screen pages. Normally I wouldn’t call attention to a phone maker’s custom wallpaper, but this one is especially strange because it’s extraordinarily laggy at times. Occasionally it plays back with all the fluidity of a poorly-optimized GIF, and it’s far too low resolution to look nice on the Edge Plus’ crisp display. To make matters worse, when you’re not interacting with it, the water just kind of freezes in place — not a good look.Thankfully, you can change that wallpaper; what you can’t change is the Edge Plus’ weak update roadmap. Motorola typically commits to only one major software upgrade for its devices, which is disheartening but unfortunately common in the realm of cheap Android phones in which Motorola typically operates.But, of course, the Edge Plus is not a cheap Android phone. And when we asked the company if they were modifying that stance in this case, a spokesperson initially told us that while Motorola “does not have absolute commitment to numbers of upgrades, Edge consumers can expect security updates every other month and a quick upgrade to Android 11.”Most devices in the Edge Plus’ price range receive two major Android updates over the course of their lives, and Google promises three for its Pixel phones. Even Samsung recently upped its support window to three years. So the fact that Motorola wouldn’t go on record and commit to two — especially when the Edge Plus’ software is so similar to stock Android, at least outwardly — was maddening.Evidently, someone at Motorola felt the same, and shortly after reviews of the Motorola Edge Plus broke from various outlets, the company decided to bestow the Edge Plus with a second major update, to Android 12, later in its life. That's good news for Edge Plus owners; lets just hope the updates arrive without lengthy delays.It’s good to see Motorola pool all of its expertise and resources into a flagship phone for the first time in roughly half a decade. The issue is, outside of the Edge Plus’ audio features — particularly its booming speakers and headphone jack — I struggle to come up with reasons someone would choose it over similarly priced device.Sure, the Edge Plus’ display is very nice, but so are the OnePlus 8 Pro’s and the Samsung Galaxy S20’s — and those phones’ panels get brighter, too. Likewise, the Edge Plus is a top performer, but those other Android phones are just as fast where it counts. (And that’s to say nothing of the A13 Bionic-powered iPhone 11 series, which continues to outpace the Snapdragon contingent despite packing a fraction of the RAM.) The Edge Plus’ cameras are solid also, but — well, you get the picture.Now, Motorola’s flagship is reasonably priced, all things considered; it may not be a bargain, but remember that the Galaxy S20 Plus and S20 Ultra ask between $200 to $400 more for similar specs. Ordinarily, that’d make the Edge Plus an easy enough recommendation for any buyer interested in a Samsung alternative. But then it’s not, because you have to be on Verizon to use it. And the bonus of millimeter-wave 5G speeds when you’re in the right city at the right time doesn’t justify that exclusivity.In this day and age when so many phones are available through multiple carriers as well as unlocked, it’s hard to imagine anyone switching to Big Red for an Android phone that, while powerful, shares so many features with so many other, similarly-priced Android phones. To overcome that barrier of entry, the Edge Plus needed to be exceptional — but it’s just merely good."
79,Motorola Edge,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-edge-review,"It would be understandable if you thought of the Motorola Edge as a slightly-stripped down version of the Motorola Edge Plus, the phone maker's return to the world of flagship devices. Gone is the more powerful processor and camera, and Motorola has shrunk the battery. In exchange, you get a phone that's $300 cheaper and no longer tied to Verizon's cellular network.Price: $699 Screen size: 6.7-inch OLED (2340 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 765 RAM: 6GB Storage: 256GB Rear cameras: 64MP main (f/1.8); 16MP ultrawide (f/2.2); 8MP telephoto (f/2.4) Front camera: 25MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 4,500 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 12:12 Size: 6.4 x 2.8 x 0.37 inches Weight: 6.63 ouncesWhile some trade-offs are definitely on display here for the lower price and the freedom of having an unlocked phone, our Motorola Edge review found a device that's more than just a lite version of its more feature-packed sibling. In one key area of our testing, the Edge actually bested the Edge Plus, though sadly one of the major flaws from the more expensive flagship device remain on display here.The Motorola Edge costs $699 and is available unlocked through Motorola, Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. You can use the Motorola Edge with any wireless carrier.At $699, that places the Motorola Edge squarely in the category of midrange 5G-capable handset that aren't as pricey as today's best 5G phones (like, say, the Motorola Edge Plus). The Motorola Edge shares a price with the Samsung Galaxy A71 5G, and it's $100 more than the LG Velvet.From afar, the Motorola Edge looks very stylish, with a distinctive curved display and a look that's indistinguishable from a premium phone. Pick the device up, though, and give the back a tap. That's clearly a plastic frame, which Motorola has turned to as a way to reduce the cost from the more premium Edge Plus. It's not a trade-off that really bothers me, though my Solar Black review unit seemed to smudge fairly easily.At 6.4 x 2.8 x 0.37 inches, the Motorola Edge is essentially the same size as the Edge Plus — hardly a surprise since both phones sport the same 6.7-inch Endless Edge OLED panel. The curved screen is largely cosmetic, based on my experience, though Motorola has baked in a few shortcuts. You can slide your finger alongside the screen to either summon settings (a downwide swipe) or apps (an upward one), and swiping leftward from the action bar can bring up certain shortcuts. If you didn't know the feature was there, though, you wouldn't think to use it. Really, the only noticeable feature brought by that curved screen is that it makes the Motorola Edge more difficult to hold, and more prone to unintentional taps.Unlike phones that feature big, blocky camera arrays on the back these days, Motorola stacks its rear lenses in a sensible and subtle way. The Motorola logo on the back of the Edge is just there for show — if you want to access the phone's fingerprint reader, it lives underneath the phone's display. That, plus a punch-hole cutout for the selfie cam, allows Motorola to present the Edge's screen without much in the way of bezels — and that's welcome, considering the marquee display feature that the Motorola Edge offers.That marquee feature would be the Motorola Edge's 90Hz refresh rate, a speed it shares with the more expensive Edge Plus. While other phones offer even faster refresh rates — the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and OnePlus 8 Pro both refresh at 120Hz rates — it's not often a feature you see in phones that cost less than $700. The standard OnePlus 8 also has a 90Hz refresh rate, as does the OnePlus Nord (though that latter phone isn't available in the US).The faster refresh rate is a welcome addition to the Motorola Edge. Scrolling through web pages is a pleasure, as you'll see when toggle back and forth between the 60Hz and 90Hz options. You can even trust the Edge to make the decision for you, by enabling a setting that allows it to automatically adjust the display's refresh speed based on whether you'll benefit from the 90Hz refresh rate or whether it makes more sense to not tax the phone's battery.The displays of the Motorola Edge and Edge Plus share more than just the same maximum refresh rate. They're basically identical from what I can tell, which is certainly a good thing since watching videos is so enjoyable on the Edge's screen. Like its pricier sibling, the Edge handles all sorts of colors very well, whether it's the shimmering waters of the Nile in the YouTube trailer for Death on the Nile or the mysterious shadows masking Daniel Craig's nemesis in the upcoming Bond movie. The experience is all the more cinematic thanks to the 21:9 aspect ratio on the Motorola Edge, which also happens to make the phone easier to operate with one hand.How closely matched is the Motorola Edge's display to that of the Edge Plus? Both were able to capture roughly the same percentage of the sRGB color spectrum — 194.1% for the Edge, 189.9% for the Edge Plus. Both were equally consistent with how they rendered those colors, with Delta-E ratings of 0.32 and 0.31, respectively. When it comes to phones in the Motorola Edge's price range, the Galaxy A71 5G captures more vibrant colors, rendering 200.3% of the sRGB color rating, but its Delta-E rating of 0.33 means it's slightly less accurate than the Edge. The LG Velvet has a more muted color palette by default — 140.6% of the sRGB spectrum — but does it more accurately with a Delta-E rating of 0.30.The Motorola Edge turns out to split the difference, registering a peak brightness of 558 nits as measured by our light meter. The LG Velvet was brighter, at 567 nits, with both phones outshining the Galaxy A71 5G (481 nits). I never really ran into an issue reading the Motorola Edge's screen outside, though.One of the areas Motorola has scaled back from the Motorola Edge Plus can be found with the cameras included on the Motorola Edge. Instead of the Plus' 108-megapixel sensor — the same one found on the Galaxy S20 Ultra — the Motorola Edge features a 64MP main camera. Other optics include a 16MP ultra wide angle camera, an 8MP telephoto lens with a 2x optical zoom and a time-of-flight sensor.The problem isn't that the Motorola Edge features less powerful optics than the Edge Plus — you've got to expect some sacrifices for that $300 price cut. Rather, the problem is that the Edge delivers the same underwhelming images we got when we tested the Edge Plus, especially compared against what the best camera phones are capable of.Take this sculpture of a penguin I shot during a socially-distanced trip to the Oakland Zoo. On a bright, sunny day, the Motorola Edge was a bit overwhelmed by the sunlight and you get a streak of glare shooting down from the top of the picture. The colors feel a bit muted, too. That's not a problem the Pixel 4 XL suffers from, as the tree behind the penguin is a bright green, the penguin's eyes aren't lost in shadow, and there's no trace of glare from the sun. The Pixel even manages to capture some of the textures of the sculpture, so that you can see it's crafted out of recycled plastic.Indoors, the Motorola Edge fares much better when I took a picture of some waffles and sausage. Even with light streaming in from a nearby window, the Edge produces a balanced shot that lets you pick out little details like the seeds on the strawberries and the char on the sausage links. I think the colors on the Pixel 4 XL's shot are warmer and the silverware remains in focus, but there's nothing really wrong with what the Motorola Edge produces.As the light falls, the Motorola Edge does a decent job capturing a sunset at the local marina. I particularly like how Motorola's phone renders the pink and purple colors of the sky far off in the distance. Objects closer to the camera, like the pillar on the closest pier, seem a little out of focus, and I think the LG Velvet did a better job making the shadowy boats look more distinct. But I'm not displeased by what the Motorola Edge did here.I can't say the same for the Motorola Edge's Night Vision, which has a hard time focusing on the stuffed animals bathed in unforgiven blue LED lights. The edges of each stuffed animal looked blurred and background details don't really stand out. The Pixel 4 XL's effort isn't great either, but at least the color is consistent and you can make out the outlines of each individual animal. The plants in the background also aren't blurry the way they are in the Motorola Edge's shot.Back at the zoo, I tried out the Motorola Edge's telephoto lens on an American black bear. And while I appreciate the fact that the 2x zoom allowed me to get close without getting mauled, I wish the finished shot would have been more in focus. That's not a problem for the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which keeps the bear sharp and focused even though she's on the move. The grass looks more vibrant in the iPhone 11 Pro Max's shot as well.Pulling back, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's wide angle lens lets me see more of the black bear enclosure than I got using the 117-degree view on the Motorola Edge's ultra wide shooter. The same problem with focus that's bedeviled the Motorola Edge in other shots is on display here, though to be fair, even the iPhone struggles to keep the bears in the far background in focus.The time-of-flight sensor on the Motorola Edge helps produce some good-looking portrait photos. While its attempt to capture my daughter turned out a little bit darker than the LG Velvet's effort, I think it's a better shot overall, with a more stylistic blur. The Motorola Edge also made good use of the shadow caused by the light streaming from the left to emphasize details on the right side of my daughter's face.This self-portrait shot with the Motorola Edge's 25MP selfie cam isn't bad either, though the left side of my beard gets caught up in the background blur. The ruddiness of my face in the Edge's shot is probably more accurate, though I prefer the way the Pixel 4 XL toned down the color, even if Google's phone got a little aggressive with smoothing out my face. Still, while the Edge's rear cameras sometimes struggled to depict bright colors, the phone's front camera definitely got the green of my baseball cap spot on.Unlike the Motorola Edge Plus, which features the powerful Snapdragon 865 chipset, the Motorola Edge turns to the Snapdragon 765, which has less processing oomph. It's a cost-cutting move that allows the phone to still provide 5G connectivity — there's a 5G modem included in the Snapdragon 765 system-on-chip — so it's a processor found on a lot of phones that want to offer 5G without also featuring a high-price tag.The good news is, it's not too big a sacrifice turning to the Snapdragon 765 instead of the 865. Yes, there's a noticeable gap in raw performance. The Motorola Edge's 1,867 multicore score on the Geekbench 5 general performance test is well behind the 3,350 result turned in by the Motorola Edge Plus. But in the kind of everyday tasks most people use their phones for, you're not really going to notice — the Motorola Edge handles all but the most processor-intensive apps with aplomb.Even demanding apps run just fine on the Motorola Edge. I played PUBG Mobile on the phone and didn't notice any lags or game-altering stutters. More powerful phones render the graphics a little more sharply, but gameplay itself was more than fine. My only complaint is that I had a hard time making my avatar turn — a hardship I'm going to blame on the phone's curved edges, which I think increases the chances of inadvertent touches.Stack the Motorola Edge up against other phones powered by the Snapdragon 765, and you'll see comparable performance. On Geekbench, the Motorola Edge out-pointed the Galaxy A71 5G (1,796), but fell behind the LG Velvet and its 1,927 score. That's likely because LG's phone uses the Snapdragon 765G variant, which offers a little bit of a performance boost, especially when it comes to graphics. Indeed, on the GFXBench Aztec Ruins Vulkan test for high-tier devices, the Motorola Edge's 447.5 frame result fell behind both the Velvet (548 frames) and Galaxy A71 (551 frames).The Motorola Edge Plus enjoys a huge 5,000 mAh battery, which translated to a time of 10 hours and 55 minutes on our battery test, nearly good enough to land on our best phone battery life list of the longest-lasting devices. The Motorola Edge may have a smaller battery at 4,500 mAh, but it still lasted much longer on a charge, holding out for 12 hours and 12 minutes on that same test, which involves continuous web surfing over cellular. (Typically we use T-Mobile's network, but because of my current location in coronavirus lockdown, I had to use Verizon.)Why such a good result even with the smaller battery? We think the power efficiency of the Snapdragon 765 helped out a lot with the Motorola Edge's longevity. It's also worth noting those results came when we had the screen set to a 60Hz refresh rate. Upgrading to 90Hz consumed a little more power, but the Motorola Edge still held out for 11 hours, 35 minutes.Just don't expect equally impressive results when you charge the phone. Like its pricier sibling, the Motorola Edge claims to offer fast charging with an 18W charger included. But after 30 minutes of charging a drained phone, the Edge's battery had only climbed back to 36%. The Galaxy A71 5G used its 25W charger to get to 60% in that time.If you've ever used a Motorola phone before, you'll be familiar with the My UX interface the Motorola Edge features on top of Android 10 — and that's a good thing. Motorola takes a light hand with Android, adding features that are largely useful, such as the Moto Actions that simplify tasks like turning on the phone's flashlight (two chopping motions) or taking screenshots (touch the screen with three fingers). If there's something you don't like about the interface, you can probably change it, including fonts and icon shapes, wallpapers, and even the animation that appears on the on-display fingerprint sensor.That's good, because I'm not a fan of the wallpaper that comes with the Motorola Edge by default. It features a rolling wave that rolls across the screen and then... stops. It makes the Edge's otherwise polished display feel herky-jerky and even worse, the effect occurs any time you switch between screens, exit apps or unlock your phone. It's pretty distracting, but fortunately changeable.The Motorola Edge ships with Android 10, and Motorola has promised you'll get the newly released Android 11 on this phone via a software update. And after that... who knows? Motorola's only committed to one major Android update with the more expensive Motorola Edge Plus, when two updates are the common practice. (Motorola does promise security updates every other month in addition to updates through the Google Play store.) You'd figure the Motorola Edge has little hope of seeing any updates beyond Android 11 unless Motorola changes its tune.The Motorola Edge delivers a lot of value for the money, retaining some of the better features of the Motorola Edge Plus, such as its colorful display, 90Hz refresh rate and 5G compatibility. But it also does things the Edge Plus can't, like last a while on a charge and free you up to take your phone to the carrier of your choice.Unfortunately, it's also felled by the biggest flaw of the Motorola Edge Plus — a camera that underperforms. And that's why it fails to distinguish itself from similarly priced competition. Yes, the Motorola Edge has a lot going for it, but the LG Velvet costs $100 less, features 5G connectivity and produces photos that are comparable and in many cases better. The Pixel 5 and entry-level iPhone 12 are waiting in the wings, too, posing formidable challenges for the Motorola Edge."
80,Android 11,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/android-11,"Android 11 is currently rolling out to Google’s Pixel phones (from 2017’s Pixel 2 and 2 XL to the new Pixel 4a) as well as the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro. It’ll likely reach Samsung’s Galaxy handsets closer to the end of the year or early part of 2021, with priority being granted to the Galaxy S20 and Note 20 lines, as they’re the latest flagships from the company.  If you have a Pixel device but are still waiting for the new software to land on your device, check out our guide on how to get Android 11 right now.Another year, another update to the world’s most popular mobile operating system — and this year, that means Android 11. But what could Google possibly add to a platform that’s been kicking for more than a decade, that seemingly already contains every feature under the sun?That’s where Android 11 comes in. As we’ve come to expect from Android updates in recent years, version 11 opts for smaller changes rather than transformative ones, that make navigating Google’s OS a bit more intuitive and convenient. Redesigned screenshots and media playback controls, a new way to message friends and useful tweaks to app permissions may not be earth-shattering additions, but they’re nonetheless appreciated.Or, at least appreciated by those who can get them. Like with all Android updates, it’ll be awhile before devices that aren’t made by Google — like the Galaxy Note 20, for example — gets to join in on the Android 11 party. (The lone exceptions to that are OnePlus, Xiaomi, Oppo and Realme, which have impressively already issued Android 11 updates to their latest models.)Our Android 11 review highlights where Google’s latest software succeeds, and which features need a little more work.While Android 11 feels like more of a conservative update than, say, iOS 14 and its redesigned widgets and new App Library interface, Google’s OS does introduce some really welcome improvements. Here are the major ones:New media controls: Android has always been good about carving out a little space for playback controls in the notification pane, for currently playing media. It’s an approach I much prefer to Apple’s, which splits up some media controls across the lock screen and others in the Control Center, with neither looking all that great or being particularly great at conveying information.What’s new about Android 11’s approach is that Google has lifted these controls out of the cluster of notifications in which they used to sit and given them priority in a space just underneath your quick toggles. In addition to skip, pause and play actions, a background that’s color-matched to album art and a progress bar that appears when expanded, there’s also a new button that allows you to instantly change the audio device currently playing the media in question.This makes pivoting from your phone’s speakers to a Bluetooth speaker or a pair of wireless earbuds really, really easy. And it’s a clever shortcut to toss in now, as people have more connected devices at their disposal within their home than ever before. Android 11 will make it easier for you to use them.New screenshot interface: It wasn’t difficult to markup a recently-captured screenshot through the notification that would pop up after taking one in Android 10. But the notification itself was quite obtrusive. It’d languish up top for seconds at a time, unless you either dismissed it or interacted with it, possibly covering pertinent information all the while.Android 11 fixes that. Now, taking a screenshot produces a thumbnail in the lower-left corner — and it happens quickly. This is good of course, because any delays that impede you from snagging a clip of something and firing it off to a friend tend to be more unwelcome than not.Next to that thumbnail are share and edit buttons, as well as an “X” button that will simply dismiss the screenshot interface element, but not delete the image itself. It’s all very slick, fast, intuitive and looks great.However, I have one small issue with the approach Google’s taken here. One of the best things about the way iOS handles screenshots is that it allows you to delete whatever you capture immediately after sending it off. This is really handy, because it means your photo library won’t be flooded with screenshots of one-time, out-of-context snippets of information and memes that you really don’t need living on your phone for days or weeks until you finally get around to deleting them. You can quickly delete screenshots in Android 11 too, but the software doesn’t make it easy, as you have to press or gesture back a bunch of times in succession after sharing a screenshot to return to the markup screen, where you can then hit the little trash icon. A tiny frustration, but one I’d personally like to see addressed.Screen recording built-in: If you’ve been mostly using Android phones from the likes of Samsung and OnePlus over the last several years, you may never have noticed that Android has lacked native screen recording features the entire time. But Pixel users still needed to turn to sketchy, oftentimes ad-ridden third-party solutions to capture activity on their device — until now.Android 11 finally bakes screen recording right into Android, and it works very, very well on our Pixel 4a. It’s activated from a quick toggle shortcut, and offers options like choosing which audio source you’d like to accompany the visual element (your handset’s microphone versus on-device audio) and whether or not you'd like to highlight taps and gestures. As you’re recording, a red icon in the status bar reminds you that the feature is rolling; to turn it off, simply dip back into the notifications pane and tap the relevant item to stop.One-time permissions and permission resetting: Every year, it seems like Google and Apple turn up the heat on developers that abuse permissions, by making those permissions more stringent or temporary. With Android 11, users now have the ability to grant a single-use permission for an app they’d like to use once or twice, and then maybe never again.Android 11 also automatically resets permissions for apps that have sat on your device dormant for months. If there’s an app you rarely use anymore — given the pandemic, I find myself taking far fewer Lyfts and Ubers than I used to — this feature instantly justifies itself. And considering how Uber’s had a concerning track record of abusing location monitoring in the past, I’d say this particular Android 11 addition is overdue.Every software update is a work in progress, but too many significant features in Android 11 needed a little more attention before the software’s final release.Bubbles: Long teased over successive Android updates but never brought to the public until now, Bubbles is basically Google’s version of Chat Heads — the Facebook Messenger feature that creates shortcuts for conversation threads that float above whatever’s on screen and persist from app to app. The difference with Bubbles is, of course, that this feature extends to messaging apps that aren’t Facebook’s, including the built-in Android Messages app for texting and RCS Chat, as well as WhatsApp and others.I don’t know if Bubbles are necessarily something that we need on top of all the other distractions and information overload we deal with on our phones’ screens, though that comes down to personal preference. How much mileage you get out of this feature will ultimately differ on a case-by-case basis. But I can’t even get the thing to work on the Pixel 4a I’m using.In my testing Bubbles don’t seem to appear at all, no matter what I do. The feature is active in Android’s settings; it’s turned on in the built-in Messages app, and I’ve even marked some conversations as Priority, which is supposed to ensure that new texts always arrive in bubble form. And yet, the floating heads of friends and family continue to elude me.Nevertheless, it’s worth pointing out that even if Bubbles did function as designed on my device, not every app supports the feature as of yet. Telegram and the aforementioned Facebook Messenger are among the few.Notification grouping: Along with the requisite updates that bring more granular control over permissions, every Android update usually tweaks notification behavior in some way, forcing users to get accustomed to a new system before Google inevitably adjusts it yet again the following year.As a longtime Android user, I find that pattern grating even if the ideas at the heart of the updates are typically good. Android 11 breaks conversations out of notifications from other kinds of apps, giving them their own little space to catch your eye. This is reflected to greater effect when you set a thread with a particular individual or group to “Priority,” at which point those notifications will be given higher placement in the pane and also take up space in the status bar with a distinctive icon that reflects their avatar, rather than a generic new message icon.That’s all fine in theory; the problem is that, in my experience, messages don’t always separate themselves into the conversations group on their own. In fact, to designate one Android Messages thread as a conversation, I actually had to long-press on the alert for that particular thread and manually add it to a list of conversations in the system settings. That’s way too much work, and it’s buried in a series of menus that most users will probably never uncover. This is a notification from a chat app; clearly it’s a conversation and should be classified as such. What else could it possibly be?I can only assume this, like the issues I’ve encountered with Bubbles, is not an intended behavior. Hopefully, in time notification grouping will be smoothed out.You’ll find a few other things in Android 11 that are worth highlighting.Wireless Android Auto for all: This will only affect you if you have a new car that also happens to support wireless Android Auto. However, if you are among that small contingent of people, you’ll be pleased to know that all Android phones now support Android Auto wirelessly when running Android 11. Previously, only specific devices could connect to vehicles’ infotainment displays without the need for a cable.A more useful power menu: Beginning with Android 10, Google punched up the Android power menu to include quick access Google Pay cards and passes, as well as power off, screenshot and restart controls. With Android 11, Google Home-connected accessories now appear on this screen as well. Again, how useful this is will likely depend on how smart your home is, but for those living with a bevy of connected products at their disposal, like lights and smart locks, this could be very convenient indeed.App suggestions on Pixel home screen: This one’s for Google’s phones only, but a new option now devotes space right above the home screen search bar to the apps your Pixel thinks you want to use at any given moment, deriving its recommendations from contextual cues and artificial intelligence. If this sounds like an overreach to you, don't fret — it's not on by default. While I envision some users may like the feature, personally I consider the bottom five apps in my home screen to be the most important on my device, so I'd prefer they remain static.A worthwhile but hardly revolutionary upgrade, Android 11 certainly won’t make the experience of using your Android phone worse. Given the maturity of Google’s platform at this point, that’s pretty much all you can hope for.That said, some of its new features — particularly those concerning messaging and notifications — don’t seem ironed out quite yet. In time they likely will be, which is perhaps a consolation to anyone who has an Android phone that isn’t made by Google or OnePlus, and will have to wait some time before the update rolls out to their handset. Rest assured, you’re not missing much here."
81,LG Velvet,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lg-velvet,"Screen size: 6.8-inch p-OLED (2460 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 765G (AT&T/Verizon); MediaTek Dimensity 1000c (T-Mobile) RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB microSD: Yes, up to 2TB Rear cameras: 48MP main (f/1.8); 8MP wide (f/2.2); 5MP depth (f/2.4) Front camera: 16MP (f/1.9) Battery size: 4,300 mAh (AT&T); 4,000 mAh (Verizon) Battery life: 10 hrs: 29 mins Size: 6.6 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches Weight: 6.3 ouncesThe LG Velvet is the electronics giant’s attempt to break out of the ""seen one, seen 'em all"" cycle of smartphone updates. While not groundbreaking, the handsome 3D Arc design on the mid-range LG Velvet at least represents something different. Even the Velvet name represents an attempt to break away from the string of letters and numbers that make up most smartphone monikers.Our LG Velvet phone review found a stylish looking device that's capable of producing some pretty colorful photos, thanks to a trio of rear lenses. You also get 5G capability and pretty good battery life. Priced at $599, the LG Velvet would be a great alternative to pricier flagships -- if there weren't already cheaper phones that perform just as well.The LG Velvet was first released in July in the U.S. after debuting in South Korea. AT&T sells the LG Velvet for $599. You can also get the phone at Verizon now, where you'll pay a $100 premium for a version designed to work with Verizon's Ultra Wideband 5G network. T-Mobile starts selling the LG Velvet on Sept. 10; its version has a different chipset (the MediaTek Dimensity 1000c) and costs only $588.The LG Velvet's price puts it on the less expensive end of the 5G phone spectrum, costing $100 less than the OnePlus 8 and Samsung Galaxy A71 5G (provided you're buying AT&T's version of the phone). So far, only the £379 OnePlus Nord costs less among the best 5G phones, though that device isn't available in the US. The upcoming Pixel 4a 5G will cost $499 when it arrives, reportedly at the end of September.Design was clearly at the top of LG's priority list when it started work on the Velvet, and that focus pays off in the final product. This is not just another black slab of a phone, but one with curves and character.I particularly like what LG calls the phone's 3D Arc Design, which gives the Velvet symmetrical front and rear edges. More importantly, the curved corners really helped me get a good grip on the phone. Today's slick smartphones have a tendency to squirt out of my hand, but that never was a problem during my time with the LG Velvet.Flip the phone over, and you'll see another nice design detail. The three rear cameras on the LG Velvet are arranged on the left side of the phone in descending order. LG calls this the ""raindrop"" array, and while it seems like a small thing, it's a nice minimalist approach in an age where camera arrays bulge out from the backs of phones. You only need to look at the LG Velvet next to the comically oversized array on the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra to realize that LG went with the more clever design.AT&T offers the LG Velvet in Aurora Silver and Aurora Gray, which is a shame because those are the two least interesting colors in the rainbow of options LG has assembled. (Verizon at least livens things up with Aurora Red and Pink White versions to go with the gray model.) The Aurora Silver model I used to test the LG Velvet looks decent enough, but the flashier colors are more eye-catching. Also, the phone's glass-and-metal case is a fingerprint magnet.The LG Velvet's rounded edges make the phone appear a little thicker than rival devices, but it's a visual trick — at 0.31 inches, the Velvet is actually thinner than the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Unlike those phones, the Velvet also includes a headphone jack, so who's complaining?The LG Velvet features a bright, colorful P-OLED screen with 2,460 x 1,080 resolution. LG uses a teardrop notch and small though still noticeable bezels at top and bottom of the phone to fit an expansive 6.8-inch display into the Velvet. The result is a pretty immersive viewing experience, whether you're playing games or watching videos, even if you don't get the faster 120Hz refresh rate found on other phones.Watching the teaser trailer for the Suicide Squad sequel — we all have to make sacrifices for our job — John Cena's red Peacemaker getup popped off the LG Velvet's screen. Other phones I've tested have had problems with darkly lit scenes in the trailer for No Time to Die, but the LG Velvet handled those with aplomb. And the bright Golden of Age of Hollywood tones from Hail, Caesar! shone through when I streamed that movie over Netflix.According to our tests, the default display setting for the LG Velvet captures 140.6% of the sRGB color spectrum. That's a wider range of colors than the Pixel 4a (105.8%), though the Motorola Edge, which uses a Saturated setting as its default, captured 194.1%. When we set the Motorola Edge's display to a more natural setting, its sRGB reading of 138.8% was in line with what we saw from the LG Velvet.The LG Velvet renders colors as accurately as other phones in this price range, with a Delta-E rating of 0.30. That's a little bit better than the Motorola Edge (0.32) and Galaxy A71 5G (0.33), as numbers closer to zero are more accurate.The best part about the LG Velvet's display is how bright it is. With adaptive brightness turned on, we got a reading of 567 nits. That's not as good as the Pixel 4a's reading of 681 nits with adaptive brightness enabled, but it's ahead of the Motorola Edge (558 nits) and Galaxy A71 5G (481 nits).You get three cameras on the LG Velvet — a 48-megapixel main camera, augmented by an 8MP wide angle lens and 5MP depth sensor. That means no telephoto lens — a common sacrifice for phones at this price range, though the Motorola Edge includes one. The LG Velvet can't compete against the best camera phones out there, but it still produces some decent-looking shots. And in some cases, the cameras can even surprise you with what they produce.This shot of an apple tree in my backyard features realistic colors and a reasonable amount of detail — you can see some of the the patterns in the leaves in the foreground of the shot, and I think the LG Velvet did a good job recreating the splash of red beginning to stretch across the ripening apples.A similar shot from the Moto Edge puts the focus on the apples toward the back of the tree, leaving the apple toward the front of the shot somewhat blurred around its edges. The LG Velvet takes the opposite approach, and the result is a better composed shot.Moving indoors, this plate of waffles looks bright and colorful in the LG Velvet's photo, with the strawberries and sausage links glistening. However, the Velvet struggles a little bit with light pouring in from a nearby window. The Pixel 4 XL doesn't have that problem, and while its photo is a little bit darker than what the Velvet produced, it's also a more balanced photo that keeps everything sharply focused.The LG Velvet really has a hard time when the lights are low, even after you enable the camera’s Night View feature. Some stuffed animals arranged in my backyard under a string of unforgiving blue LED lights aren't really in focus in the LG Velvet’s picture, and you have a hard time making out details, like the fig tree trunk in the background. My daughter's bubble-blowing toy on the left-hand side of the table is also a psychedelic blur. The Pixel keeps the blue cast in its Night Sight shot, but all the animals and other objects are in focus. It's not a great shot, by any means, but it's better detailed than what the LG Velvet has to offer.Wildfires in California make this a crummy time to take landscape shots with any wide angle lens, but this hazy shot of the Oakland skyline from across the San Leandro Channel looks a little better in the LG Velvet's version. The LG Velvet managed to keep all the building in focus, while the Motorola Edge's rendition loses some of the sharpness.The depth sensor on the LG Velvet didn't really help when it was time to take a portrait shot. This photo of my daughter turned out okay, and even the shadows caused by the light from the nearby window are used to good effect here. But zoom in on the hair on the left of my daughter's head — the LG Velvet gets a little over-aggressive when it comes to blurring that hair, a problem the Motorola Edge didn't run into. I also prefer the Motorola Edge using a tighter frame on my daughter when it's in portrait mode.Besides blurs, you can have the LG Velvet try out other effects on portrait shots, everything from stage lighting to 3D photo effects. I used a cartoon effect on that same portrait of my daughter and I like what the effect imposed on the view outside the window on the left of the shot. I think the Velvet struggled with separating my daughter's hair and shirt from the rest of the background, though.Those different portrait effects reveal that the LG Velvet has been designed with creative types in mind. That's also apparent when you explore the video capture capabilities of the phone. You can record video at up to Ultra HD resolution, but LG has thrown in a few other features for capturing more distinct-looking footage. An ASMR recording mode, for example, lets you amplify faint sounds without having to worry about distortion. A short clip of some sausage links cooking in my oven amplifies the sizzle to make it sound like we're in a rainstorm.I was less impressed by a voice bokeh feature that allows you to hone in on a particular subject's voice instead of any background noise. I tried to capture a video of my daughter singing along to her favorite pop song, but I noticed no real improvement with the bokeh voice feature enabled.Up front, the LG Velvet features a 16MP camera that produces decent selfies, though you'll find better self-portraits elsewhere. Turning on the portrait feature with the Velvet's front camera, I look a little washed out, though the background blur effect is rendered decently enough. The Pixel 4 XL's version is brighter, though, even if my face isn't as ruddy in really life. I also think the Pixel does a better job accounting for the ambient light in the background.The LG Velvet replaces LG's old G series of phones, which typically used the best Qualcomm silicon available at the time of release. The LG G8x ThinQ, for example, turned to the Snapdragon 855, the best Android system-on-chip when that phone debuted last year.With the Velvet, LG is taking a different route, stepping down to Qualcomm's 7 Series of chipsets. You'll still get decent performance from the Snapdragon 765G powering the AT&T and Verizon versions of the LG Velvet, but nothing approaching the Snapdragon 865 found in the best Android phones to come out in 2020.Not that the trade-off really matters. The Snapdragon 765G can handle most of what mobile apps and games throw at it, and as a result, the LG Velvet's performance either matches or exceeds comparably priced phones.On the Geekbench 5 test, which measures overall performance, the LG Velvet posted a multicore score of 1,927. The OnePlus Nord — which also uses a Snapdragon 765G chipset — beats that ever so slightly with a score of 1,948. But the LG Velvet outperforms comparably priced phones like the Galaxy A71 5G (1,796) and Motorola Edge (1,867), both of which run on a Snapdragon 765.The Snapdragon 765G is characterized by better graphic performance, so you'd expect a phone like the LG Velvet to dominate the competition. Our tests found a mixed bag, however. In 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL test, for example, the LG Velvet's score of 4,644 bested both the OnePlus Nord (4,251) and Motorola Edge (4,237). But on the GFXBench Aztec Ruins Vulkan test for high-tier devices, the LG Velvet's score of 548 frames or 8.5 frames per second fell just behind the Galaxy A71 5G and its standard Snapdragon 765 chipset, which produced a result of 551 frames, or 8.6 frames per second.The Snapdragon 765G comes with a built-in X52 modem, meaning the LG Velvet can connect to 5G networks where available. Our review unit came with an AT&T SIM card, and from my front porch, I could hop on to AT&T’s nationwide 5G network, which produces slightly faster download speeds than LTE. Once I moved to the backyard, thought, I was back in AT&T's 5GE network — a fancy way of saying LTE. That experience just speaks to the vagaries of 5G coverage at this point. Standing in my driveway, AT&T’s 5G network provided download speeds of 16.1 Mbps over 5G on the LG Velvet, and if that sounds bad, consider that a few feet way over LTE, my speeds topped out at 2.64 Mbps.Now all that applies to the version of the LG Velvet you can get at AT&T or Verizon. T-Mobile sells an LG Velvet that's powered with MediaTek's Dimenisty 1000c system-on-chip, which includes a 5G modem that works with the carrier's low- and mid-band 5G network. We can't say how the Dimensity-powered LG Velvet compares to other phones — let alone its Snapdragon 765G-based siblings — until we get the T-Mobile version in for testing.The 4,300 mAh inside the AT&T version of the  LG Velvet hints at decent battery life, and the phone delivered in our testing. We set the LG Velvet's screen to 150 nits and then had it surf the web over a cellular connection — AT&T's in this instance — until it ran out of power. The LG Velvet lasted 10 hours and 29 minutes on this test, which is better than the average for smartphones.(Note that the Verizon version of the LG Velvet has a smaller 4,000 mAh battery to accommodate the antennas needed to connect to the carrier’s 5G network. We’d anticipate a different battery result test for that model of the LG Velvet.)Some rival phones last longer. The Galaxy A71 5G, for instance, held out for 20 minutes longer on our test, getting closer to the 11-hour mark that's the standard for the best phone battery life. But the LG Velvet outperformed the Pixel 4a (8:55), which struggled in our testing.You can charge the LG Velvet wirelessly if you want, and AT&T’s version of the phone comes with a 16.2W charger. (Verizon customers are treated to a 25W charger.) We got the phone back to a 24% charge after 30 minutes. The Galaxy A71 5G promises to get back up to 60% after half-an-hour of charging, and the OnePlus Nord's Warp Charge 30T gets you close to 70%, so the LG Velvet is on the slow side here.The LG Velvet runs Android 10 with LG's overly fussy UX skin. At least, there's minimal duplication between LG's included apps and the Google ones that come with Android, but the AT&T version of this phone comes loaded down with extra software. In addition to an entire folder's worth of apps like AT&T ProTech, myAT&T, Call Protect and Mobile Security, you'll find icons for AT&T TV, HBO Max, and multiple Game of Thrones games among other non-essential downloads.LG offers a $199 Dual Screen case for the LG Velvet that adds a second 6.8-inch screen alongside the Velvet's standard display. As with other phones like the LG V60 ThinQ, you can use this second screen to run apps side by side or, in some cases, across a full screen. Gamers can turn one of the displays into a virtual gamepad. It's a little bit clunky, to be honest, though I did appreciate the 2.1-inch display on the Dual Screen case where notifications and other information can appear.Like the V60, the LG Velvet supports pens with Active Electrostatic (AES) digitizer technology. An included QuickMemo+ app works with such pens to let you sketch and create handwritten notes. I didn't have a chance to test this feature. Recent LG flagships have featured a quad digital-to-audio converter, which have made those models some of the best sounding phones you can buy. That's missing from the LG Velvet, which offers stereo speakers and an LG 3D Sound Engine. Personally, I found the audio on the Velvet to be fine, but if you're used to that DAC on previous phones, prepare for a bit of a step back.LG deserves credit for trying to shake up its phone lineup. The LG G series that the Velvet replaces just wasn't resonating with people. Swapping in a better looking phone — which the LG Velvet clearly is — is a big step toward making LG's handsets relevant with a wider audience. The cameras also take decent pictures, though LG would be advised to improve with low-light performance and portrait shots.The problem the LG Velvet faces is that at $599 — or more, if you opt for Verizon's version — you're not getting maximum value for your buck. In the past few months, Apple, Google and OnePlus have all released phones that cost less than the Velvet and outperform it in crucial areas. The Velvet can claim better battery life than the iPhone SE and Pixel 4a, and it's got 5G compatibility, but otherwise Apple and Google offer more compelling phones. The OnePlus Nord is a better value, too, though at least LG has made its new phone available to U.S. shoppers.The LG Velvet is a good phone that with a tweak here or there can be a great one. Anyone who puts a premium on style will be pleased with this device, but there are better bargains."
82,Asus ZenFone 7 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/asus-zenfone-7-pro-review-hands-on,"Display: 6.7-inch AMOLED (FHD+; 90Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 865 Plus RAM: 8GB Storage: 256GB Cameras: 64MP main (ƒ/1.8), 12MP ultrawide, 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom Battery: 5,000 mAh OS: Android 10 with ZenUI 7 Size: 6.5 x 3.04 x 0.37 inches Weight: 8.11 ouncesAsus surprised us last year with the ZenFone 6 —a quirky yet powerful phone with a nifty camera that could flip a full 180 degrees, all at a compelling price tag of just $499. Its replacement for 2020, the Asus ZenFone 7, doubles down on its predecessor's funky imaging system and performance value — and in doing so is sure to end up one of the year's strangest handsets.But there's a catch: the ZenFone 7 won't be as widely available as ZenFones of the past have been. Asus is skipping the U.S. and Canada with its forthcoming device, meaning that those interested in getting their hands on one will have no choice but to fish for an import.Additionally, there's not one, but two versions of the newest ZenFone this go around: the standard ZenFone 7, as well as a slightly more premium variant called the ZenFone 7 Pro. We've been able to go hands on with the ZenFone 7 Pro, and although our time with it has been brief thus far, it's already clear there's no device quite like it out there. Here's the lowdown.We don't know precisely how much the ZenFone 7 and ZenFone 7 Pro will cost yet — Asus plans on announcing that September 1. However, we do know that it's destined for some European countries.In Taiwan, where the device is already on sale, the regular ZenFone 7 will set you back NT$27,990 (about $750), while the ZenFone 7 Pro costs NT$21,999 (about $950). That hints at a sizable jump in pricing for this generation, though how expensive devices are in other regions isn't always the best indication of how expensive they'll be in yours, so stay tuned for official word on that front.The ZenFone 7 Pro is a seriously imposing phone. The ZenFone 6 had a 6.4-inch LCD panel; the new one has a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate, no matter whether you opt for the regular ZenFone 7 or the Pro version. Both variants tip the scales at 8.11 ounces as well, making them extremely heavy; Asus' last ZenFone weighed 6.73 ounces, and even the 6.9-inch Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is eight tenths of an ounce lighter than the ZenFone 7 duo.Of course, you can chalk a fair bit of that up to the ZenFone 7's Flip Camera system and supporting motors. The housing for the Flip Camera is once again composed of a material Asus calls ""liquid metal"" which is said to be exceptionally strong yet light, helping the cameras whir around quickly. Indeed, the triple-camera stack needs only a second to rotate fully, and according to Asus, the whole array is built to withstand up to 200,000 flips. That works out to roughly 100 flips a day for five years, which is likely longer than you'll use your ZenFone 7 for.Because the cameras can move, there's no need for a front-facing lens encroaching on your display real estate, and so the ZenFone 7 has minimal bezels around the top and sides to accommodate only the earpiece. The fingerprint sensor now lives on the side of the phone and doubles as the power button, also allowing for customizable shortcuts for double taps or pressing and holding.From the back, the ZenFone 7 Pro continues the deep blue-green motif established on the ZenFone 6. The turquoise Asus logo is an attractive bit of branding, though admittedly, not much else has changed here. There's also a white model available for those seeking something a bit more understated.Unfortunately, one attribute of the ZenFone 6 that has changed — and not for the better — is the headphone jack, which is nowhere to be found on the new model. The ZenFone 7 also isn't water resistant (we imagine the Flip Camera might have something to do with that), nor can it charge wirelessly. The ZenFone 7's triple-lens camera system is likely why a buyer might opt for this device over Asus' other handset, the gaming-focused ROG Phone 3.Both the ZenFone 7 and ZenFone 7 Pro pack a 64-megapixel primary shooter with ƒ/1.8 aperture alongside a 12MP ultrawide lens with a 113-degree field-of-view and an 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. Surprisingly, you get the same sensors no matter which ZenFone 7 you choose, but only the Pro model has optical image stabilization for the main and zoom cameras.Of course, the very same cameras you get on the rear are available for group or personal selfies, thanks to the Flip Camera system. This was easily the ZenFone 6's greatest photographic advantage, as it meant the device wouldn't fall back on lesser hardware for self portraits, as practically every other phone does. The ZenFone 7 and 7 Pro are in a class of their own in terms of giving users the same quality of photos up front as around back.The software to control the Flip Camera is also quite intuitive, just as it was before. You can simply tap a button to switch to front-facing mode, or move a slider to select any angle within 180 degrees. You can also designate three angles for shortcuts, which is very handy if you find yourself going for the same ones regularly.The ZenFone 6 delivered solid photography for the money last year, though it tended toward shots that were slightly less detailed and lacking in contrast compared to those from Google's cheaper Pixel 3a XL. Hopefully Asus has been able to step up its post-processing game since then.Whether you choose the ZenFone 7 or ZenFone 7 Pro, you're getting one of Qualcomm's finest mobile chipsets — the Snapdragon 865. However, the Pro model doesn't stop there. Like the ROG Phone 3 and the Galaxy Note 20, that version opts for even faster Snapdragon 865 Plus silicon, and slightly more RAM than the regular ZenFone 7 — 8GB compared to 6GB. Both can connect to sub-6GHz 5G networks.The ZenFone 7 Pro also features 256GB of storage, which is double what the cheaper version offers. Nevertheless, you are free to slot in a microSD card on either model for up to another 2TB.Asus tells us that it focused on speeding up various aspects of the user experience, including time to boot, unlocking the phone, swiping from photo-to-photo within the gallery and even answering phone calls. The Snapdragon 865 and 865 Plus are of course already quite capable chips, so we're curious to see if the new ZenFones exhibit a noticeable advantage in those use cases.Inside both ZenFone 7 devices is a gigantic 5,000-mAh battery, which should guarantee all-day usage and then some. A 30-watt charger is included as well, which Asus says should allow the phones to reach 60% capacity in just 34 minutes, and a full charge in just over 90 minutes.Once again, Asus has skipped out on wireless charging here, which is a little disappointing. That said, the company has always placed a priority on long-term battery health, and wireless charging can induce stress on batteries over time.In keeping with that theme, the ZenFone 7 sports extensive battery care options, like a slow charge feature which limits the amount of time your device is at 100% capacity while it's juicing up overnight, then ramps up charging right to completion before you start your day. This isn't a particularly rare feature — even the latest iPhones do something similar — though it's appreciated nonetheless.Going even further, ZenFone 7 users have the option to limit the total capacity of their device's battery to 80%, again in the name of long-term preservation. Asus says that after 500 charging cycles, a battery that is fully charged every single time loses 15% of its total capacity, whereas a battery limited to 80% loses just 7%. We imagine there's a point about diminishing returns here to be made if you're intentionally limiting your phone from lasting as long as possible between charges. Still, it's an option available to you if you plan on holding onto your ZenFone 7 for a very, very long time. The ZenFone 7 and ZenFone 7 Pro seem to present a worthy upgrade over Asus' compelling bargain flagship from last year. We'd hope the new devices offer a relatively inexpensive path to a lot of performance and that trio of unique cameras, but then we don't quite know how much they cost yet.The rub, of course, is that not everyone will be able to buy these phones. That's a shame, because these new ZenFones may very well correct some of the ZenFone 6's missteps. The outgoing model's display was perhaps its biggest weakness, but the switch to AMOLED should greatly help on that front. Likewise, the addition of a telephoto lens with optical zoom will help the ZenFone 7 achieve crisper shots from a distance.Granted, Asus hasn't rewritten its own rule book here, as the new ZenFones are even heavier than the ones they're replacing, and the company's ZenUI software is still present, offering an experience that vaguely looks like stock Android, though any perceived similarity is merely skin deep.Ultimately, the ZenFone 7 could very well serve as an enticing alternative to OnePlus' latest wares, as well as Samsung's Galaxy A series and other mid-priced phones with vast feature sets. Watch this space for our full review in the coming weeks."
83,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/galaxy-s10-plus,review-6210.html","Is the Galaxy S10 Plus still worth buying now that the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus and Galaxy S20 Ultra are here? It is if you're looking to spend less on a flagship phone.You don't get 5G, but there's still plenty to like about the Galaxy S10 Plus. The Infinity-O display is glorious, and this Samsung phone lasted over 12 hours on our battery test. We also like the ultra-wide camera on the back of the S10 Plus and the Night mode for better low-light shots.If you're on the fence, be sure to check our Galaxy S20 vs Galaxy S10 comparison to see all the differences.The Galaxy S10 Plus starts at $849 with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, after a price cut following the Galaxy S20's unveiling. You can also save up to $160 with trade-in offers at Samsung. Be sure to check out our updated list of the best Galaxy S10 deals.The Galaxy S10 Plus is available from all of the major carriers, including AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon, as well as U.S. Cellular and Xfinity Mobile. You can also buy the phone unlocked. The quest for the all-screen phone is almost complete. The Infinity-O display on the Galaxy S10 Plus truly goes from edge to edge. With the exception of a narrow chin on the bottom, the S10 Plus has virtually no bezels. Samsung was able to do this because it used a laser cutter to carve out holes in the top right of the screen for the front cameras.Now that I’ve been living with the S10 Plus, I’d say that the holes can be distracting, especially when you’re using an app with a white background like Gmail. It’s like two tiny eyes staring at you. And there’s a reason Samsung created wallpapers for this phone that are darker toward the top right corner: to help hide these holes.Are the punch holes any better or worse than the iPhone XS’ notch? It’s a wash for me, because even though the notch is bigger, it swoops down from the top of the screen and isn’t an interruption like the camera holes are. Interestingly, you can hide the front cameras altogether if you want so that a black bar appears atop the screen, but that seems like an even bigger waste of real estate. (We have step-by-step instructions on hiding the front cameras if you want to do it.)Advertisement by Facebook GamingBuild your brand and grow your community by taking the next big step in streaming.Measuring 6.2 x 2.91 x 0.3 inches and weighing 6.17 ounces, the Galaxy S10 Plus is not a one-handed phone, at least not for me. I had to shift the device in my hand as tried to reach the Recent Apps button on the left side with my thumb.There's a slightly bigger issue with the design, and that's the curve on the display. This is not a new problem, but because the screen is curved and it goes from edge to edge I accidentally pressed things i didn't mean to press as I was simply holding the device.However, Samsung’s phone is more than a full ounce lighter and noticeably narrower than the iPhone XS Max (6.2 x 3.05 x 0.3 inches and 7.34 ounces). Plus, you can engage one-handed mode by swiping diagonally up and to the left from the bottom right of the screen.We tested the Galaxy S10 Plus in Prism White, which has a futuristic vibe to it and does a nice job hiding fingerprint smudges. You can also get it in Prism Black, Prism Blue and Flamingo Pink. If you prefer a more durable ceramic finish on the back to glass, you can spend an extra $250/£300 on the Ceramic White or Ceramic Black finish.This is biometric security made easy. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S10 Plus is embedded into the display and is easy to set up and use. Unlike Apple’s Face ID, you don’t have to stare at your phone and swipe up to unlock the device; you simply hold your finger on the designated area of the screen and—boom—you’re in.Unlike the 2D optical fingerprint sensors found on other phones like the OnePlus 6T, the ultrasonic reader on the S10 Plus creates a 3D map of your finger, which is supposedly more secure. It’s also plenty fast, as I never waited more than a second to log in.Several months after launch, it surfaced that the Galaxy S10's ultrasonic fingerprint sensor could be unlocked by anyone when the phone had a silicone screen protector  on the device. However, Samsung issued an update that addressed the issue. I did encounter a few false negative “No Match” messages during my initial testing. But I enjoyed much more consistent results once I remapped my finger and made sure to position my thumb from multiple angles during the registration process. Since then, I have logged in successfully almost every time. Sometimes, I get an alert that says ""keep your finger on the sensor a little longer."" So it's important to just press and hold briefly when unlocking the S10.I also tried unlocking the Galaxy S10 with a wet finger; I ran my hand under the sink and then placed my thumb on the display and I unlocked the phone. The ultrasonic fingerprint reader even worked after I smushed some potato chip crumbs between my fingers.The Galaxy S10 offers facial recognition, but the default fast scanning mode makes it all too easy for someone to unlock with a photo or video of you, which we have confirmed in testing. We suggest that you toggle the fast scanning option off or simply use the fingerprint reader.The Galaxy S10 Plus packs the most cameras we’ve seen on a Samsung phone yet with a grand total of five. There’s three in the rear, including a 12-MP dual-pixel main shooter with a variable aperture (f/1.5, f/2.4), a 12-MP telephoto lens (f/2.4) with a 2x optical zoom and an ultra-wide 16-MP camera (f/2.2) that gives you a 123-degree view.Up front, the Galaxy S10 Plus features two cameras: a 10-MP dual-pixel shooter (f/1.8) and a second 8-MP depth-sensing lens (f/2.2).The ultra-wide angle lens on the S10 Plus can produce dramatic-looking photos, giving you a more captivating view of almost any scene. Take this shot of the Grace building in New York City, which has a unique curved design. With the standard camera, you can make out the curve, but with the ultra-wide lens engaged you can see the other flat buildings around it, making the curve more pronounced.If you like to have fun with portraits, you’ll appreciate the new Live Focus effects Samsung has added to the mix. You can choose from Blur, Spin, Zoom and Color point. My fave is Color Point, which puts the main subject in color and the background in black and white. The effect worked really well for this shot of me in San Francisco standing in front of a cable car. You can also apply these effects to portraits or selfies after you shoot.Using a dedicated neural processing unit and AI, the Galaxy S10’s camera can recognize 30 different subjects, up from 20 on the Galaxy Note 9. This is not instant, though, as it took a few seconds for the dog icon to show up in the camera live view as I shot a picture of my golden retriever.The ultra-wide angle lens on the S10 Plus can produce dramatic-looking photos, giving you a more captivating view of almost any scene.To see how well the Galaxy S10 Plus’s camera performs, we faced it off against the Pixel 3, and Google’s phone came out on top. But the S10 Plus won some rounds. Take this shot of some colorful hats. The S10 Plus’s image is brighter and sharper, even if parts of the shot are a bit blown out compared to the Pixel 3’s photo of the same scene.In this shot of a cupcake, the Pixel 3 wins for a more realistic-looking chocolate, even though the Galaxy S10 Plus’s image is brighter and warmer. There’s more of a yellow cast on the S10 Plus’s shot.If you're wondering whether the Galaxy S10 Plus can take good photos in the dark, it actually can. They're just not as amazing as what the Pixel 3 can do, as evidenced by this shot taken in our video studio with almost no light. You can simply make out more of the objects on the shelf with the Pixel 3's Night Sight mode engaged.The good news is that Samsung is making its Bright Night mode its own dedicated mode with easy access right at the bottom of the camera app. Before, the camera app would decide when Bight Night mode would kick in.In side-by-side shots taken with the iPhone XS, Apple's camera delivered a brighter image of flowers and a bit more detail when I zoomed in, but I preferred the contrast in the S10’s shot.The front cameras give you the option of snapping a normal or wide-angle selfie, and you can apply all of the same fun Live Focus effects when taking portraits. The S10 Plus did a good job blurring out the background (something the S10 can’t do with its single lens) but the overall image looked a bit too smooth and over-processed compared to the Pixel 3's image.Unfortunately, the Galaxy S10 Plus' camera struggled in this portrait of my colleagues Sherri and Mike. You can see that their faces get blown out by the sun, an issue I've encountered on other Galaxy phones. The Pixel 3's image has a much more even exposure.The Galaxy S10 Plus redeemed itself with this indoor shot of macaroons; it's sharper and brighter compared to the iPhone XS' photo.When it comes to recording video, one of the top new features of the Galaxy S10 is Super Steady recording. Samsung promises an improved stabilization rate for such activities as skiing and cycling. But it can even help when you’re just filming while walking, as I discovered strolling around Bryant Park in New York City.With Super Steady off, I noticed that each of my steps caused minor jitter as I walked toward a fountain. With Super Steady on — you enable the feature by tapping a waving hand icon on the left side of the S10’s display — the action was much smoother. It was almost like a smooth tracking shot you’d see in a movie.Interestingly, the Super Steady video started out with a zoomed out view compared to the clip shot without the feature enabled. That’s because Super Steady takes advantage of the ultra-wide angle lens on the back of the Galaxy S10 Plus.As the first phone with Qualcomm’s 7-nanometer Snapdragon 855 processor in the U.S., the Galaxy S10 Plus is the fastest Android phone we’ve ever tested—even if the iPhone XS is faster in some tests.I played the Asphalt 9 racing game without a hint of lag. And in Mortal Kombat X, the graphics were so gory that when I burned a hole through someone’s torso, I felt like I was playing on a console.On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the S10 Plus turned in a multi-core score of 10,732, which beats the Galaxy Note 9 (8,876), OnePlus 6T (8,972) and Pixel 3 (7,316). All three of those phones use last year's Snapdragon 845.The iPhone XS, powered by an Apple designed A12 Bionic chip, hit a higher 11,420 on Geekbench 4.However, the Galaxy S10 Plus pulled ahead in graphics testing, as it notched a great 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme score of 5,648 (on the OpenGL ES 3.1 test). That beats the iPhone XS (4,339), last year’s Galaxy S9 (4,634), the Pixel 3 XL (4,396) and OnePlus 6T (5,183).As the first phone with Qualcomm’s 7-nanometer Snapdragon 855 processor in the U.S., the Galaxy S10 Plus is the fastest Android phone we’ve ever tested — even if the iPhone XS is faster in some tests.In our video editing test, which involves transcoding a 4K clip to 1080p and applying a filter in the Adobe Clips app, the Galaxy S10 Plus did just okay. It took the phone 2 minutes and 26 seconds to transcode the video, compared to just 39 seconds for the iPhone XS. The Galaxy S10 Plus did finish faster than other Android phones, though. It is important to note that a new video editing app is now available for the Galaxy S10 Plus, and it's been optimized for Samsung's phone.The Galaxy S10 loaded the Asphalt 9 game in 7.95 seconds, compared to 7.08 seconds for the iPhone XS. But the Galaxy S10 was faster to load Mortal Kombat X at 11.3 seconds vs 12.87 seconds for the iPhone.The Galaxy S10 Plus offers very fast 4G speeds. In fact, according to tests conducted by Ookla, the S10 Plus outperforms the iPhone XS Max by a wide margin.The new quad HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display on the Galaxy S10 Plus is indeed Samsung’s best display yet. According to DisplayMate, this is a ""record-setting display,"" earning its highest ever A+ grade. Still, in some ways we prefer the panel on the iPhone XS Max.On the plus side, there’s lots of improvements here. Dynamic Tone Mapping delivers enhanced brightness and a wider color range and Samsung has worked to reduce blue light emission, which can be harmful for your eyes.The lab results were quite good, with the S10 Plus’ screen registering 136.5 percent of the SRGb color gamut. It also achieved a Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.29 (closer to 0 is better). The Pixel 3 hit a higher 170.2 percent but it’s Delta-E was worse at 0.35. The iPhone XS Max’s screen notched a lower sRGB rating of 123 percent but delivered an even better accuracy rating than the S10 Plus at 0.22.The Galaxy S10 Plus’s panel does get plenty bright at 625 nits of peak brightness, but that’s when we shined a flashlight at its sensor. The iPhone XS registered 606 nits but delivered a brighter picture when we compared the same landscape photo on both screens side by side. The Pixel 3’s screen is way dimmer at just 362 nits.When it comes to audio quality, the S10 Plus’s speakers are pretty powerful, but they’re no match for the stereo sound from the iPhone XS Max. When playing Portugal. The Man’s “Feel It Still” on Spotify, the S10 Plus got loud but the iPhone delivered more robust bass and richer audio overall.The 4,100 mAh battery on the Galaxy S10 Plus is one of the biggest you’ll find on any Android device. On the Tom’s Guide Battery test, which involves 4G LTE web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness, the S10 Plus lasted a fantastic 12 hours and 35 minutes.That runtime surpasses the already excellent 11:26 from the Note 9’s 4,000 mAh battery and the iPhone XS Max's 10:38. Last year's Galaxy S9+ lasted 10:59 and the Google Pixel 3 XL mustered only 9:30. The S10 Plus is also the longest-lasting member of the S10 family, beating the S10 (10:19) by more than two hours and outlasting the S10E (9:41) by nearly three hours.On the Tom’s Guide Battery test, which involves 4G LTE web surfing at 150 nits of screen brightness, the S10 Plus lasted a fantastic 12 hours and 35 minutes.With all of that capacity, you can even charge other devices using the S10 Plus. Thanks to the phone’s Wireless PowerShare feature, you can use the back of the S10 Plus to charge other phones that support the Qi wireless standard — yes, including the iPhone. You can also charge Samsung’s own Galaxy Buds.The good news is that the OneUI software on the Galaxy S10 is streamlined as promised and fairly to easy to use. The settings menu, for example, presents a lot less options up front, but it’s still a cinch to make your way around. It’s also easy to activate various features without having to dig into settings; I like being able to access the shortcuts for Wireless PowerShare and Blue Light Filter right when I slide your finger down from the top of the screen.However, the round icons on the S10 feel a little too much like “my first smartphone.” At least they’re colorful and easy to distinguish at a glance. I’m even less impressed with Samsung’s implementation of gestures in Android 9.0.By default, there’s a Recent Apps, Home Button and Back button along the bottom of the display. If you decide to switch to full-screen gestures, you’ll see three options at the bottom of the screen: Swipe up from the bottom left to see recent apps, up from the bottom to go home and up from the right to bo back. I prefer the way Apple handles this; just swipe up from the bottom to go home and stop half-way if you want to see recent apps.And, yes, AR Emoji is still a thing. You can create avatars of yourself on the fly and they have better face tracking now. There's also full-body tracking and you can even create stickers from your AR Emoji to put into photos. But I found the results to be just as creepy as before.Samsung has made some Galaxy Note 10 features available for the S10 Plus. For instance, Live Focus video lets you apply bokeh effects to your video (back and front camera) and Samsung DeX for PC allows you to see notifications and send and receive messages on your laptop without having to fire up your phone. The AR Doodle feature is less compelling on the S10 Plus, however, as it's harder to draw on the display without an S Pen.On the other hand, the Galaxy S10 Plus gives you considerably longer battery life, a brighter and slightly bigger OLED display and faster performance than the Pixel 3 XL. And the S10 Plus simply looks better and is more compact than the Pixel 3 XL, which has a pretty big notch and larger bezels. Another way to put it is that Samsung wins on hardware and Google wins on software.The Galaxy S10 Plus is a great Android phone for those who don't want to pay the higher premium for the Galaxy S20. This handset gives you a big and immersive full-screen experience, very capable cameras and fast performance in a slick design. The 12.5 hours of battery life also makes the S10 Plus the longest running Samsung phone ever and one of the longest-lasting phones you can buy.Samsung also deserves credit for how seamlessly the ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and Wireless PowerShare features work. The company is moving away from gimmicks and is instead focusing on innovations that make your life easier, which is great to see.If you care about camera quality first and foremost, there are better options. But if you want a really good big-screen phone for a fairly affordable price, the Galaxy S10 Plus is still very much worth considering."
84,Samsung Galaxy A71 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a71-5g,"Price: $599 (unlocked and most carriers), $649 (Verizon) OS: Android 10 with One UI 2.0 Display: 6.7-inch OLED (2400x1080) CPU: Snapdragon 765 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB Rear camera: 64MP main (ƒ/1.8), 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2), 5MP macro (ƒ/2.4), 5MP depth (ƒ/2.2) Front camera: 32MP (ƒ/2.2) Battery: 4,500 mAh Battery life: 10:49 Size: 6.40 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches Weight: 6.53 ouncesSamsung’s cheap phones used to be so dull, you wouldn’t wish one on your worst enemy. Fortunately, the company has stepped up its game in the last year, and the Samsung Galaxy A71 5G is proof of that. For $599, the A71 sits above the rest as the top dog of Samsung’s A-series lineup for 2020, and just as the name suggests, it can even connect to 5G networks.Between its massive 6.7-inch AMOLED display, 4,500-mAh battery that lasted nearly 11 hours in our battery test and respectable overall performance, there’s much to like here, as you’ll find in our Samsung Galaxy A71 5G review. Unfortunately for Samsung, the race for the best unlocked phone has never been tighter than it is now, with the Pixel 4a, iPhone SE and OnePlus Nord locked in contention for top honors. All three of those handsets are also considerably cheaper than the A71 — relegating Samsung’s latest midrange contender to also-ran status, rather than a first-tier choice.The Samsung Galaxy A71 5G costs $599 — so long as you buy it unlocked or through AT&T, T-Mobile or US Cellular. Verizon offers the A71 as well, though it’s a version called the Galaxy A71 5G UW that’s been customized to connect to Big Red’s millimeter wave-based 5G network. That Verizon variant tacks on a $50 premium, bringing the price up to $649.No matter where you buy your Galaxy A71, you’ll get 128GB of built-in storage alongside 8GB of RAM. Storage is expandable with the use of a microSD card. All A71 devices are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765 processor.A word on the Galaxy A71’s 5G support. Excusing the Verizon-specific UW version, the A71 5G connects to sub-6GHz 5G networks. These towers offer service that is faster than existing 4G LTE, though not by a profound margin. AT&T and T-Mobile now classify their 5G networks as “nationwide,” though coverage is still quite spotty. Using our AT&T model, I wasn’t able to pick up 5G in a Pennsylvanian suburb. Your mileage may vary.Don’t let its relatively modest price fool you — the Galaxy A71 5G is a big phone, owing to its 6.7-inch display. Minimal bezels encircling the panel help keep the footprint trimmed as much as possible, but can’t save the fact that the A71 is actually harder to use one-handed than the taller-yet-more-slender Galaxy S20 Plus.Fortunately, the A71 is made a little less cumbersome by its curved back, which once again utilizes the same “glastic” material as on the Galaxy A51. Samsung has treated this plastic in such a way that it does feel more solid and substantial than plastic on midrange phones typically is, but our Prism Black unit still has a semi-reflective iridescent pattern on it that looks a little chintzy. The A71’s not ugly or not overwhelmingly cheap-feeling — but it’s still quite a ways away from the glass and metal of flagships.The front-facing camera on the Galaxy A71 5G is housed in a center-mounted hole punch with a slender earpiece just above it. However, as I soon found out listening to Spotify on the A71, this earpiece does not double as one of the phone’s stereo speakers. The lone speaker is on the bottom edge, next to the USB-C port, meaning it can be very easily covered by your palm especially when gaming. I prefer to hold big phones by cradling the bottom with my pinky, and so I naturally obscured that bottom-firing speaker every time I picked the A71 up. It was a bit annoying, to say the least.The A71 does not support wireless charging, which is a bit surprising given that this phone only costs $100 less than the iPhone 11, which can charge wirelessly. Also unlike the iPhone 11 or Samsung’s recent Galaxy S-series models, the A71 is not rated water resistant at any level. Neither feature is unreasonable to expect from a device costing more than $500; nevertheless, they’re both absent on the A71. At least Samsung didn’t nix the headphone jack.Like many other phones these days, the A71 bakes its fingerprint sensor into the display. And although that might seem like a luxury for midrange buyers, this scanner can be so stubborn to use that it had me longing for the days of rear-mounted capacitive sensors on Android devices. There’s certainly a learning curve to figuring out how the placement at which the A71 best reads your fingerprints, though even after I thought I’d figured that out, I still found myself reapplying through trial and error on some occasions.The Galaxy A71 features one of Samsung’s Super AMOLED panels, with a full-HD resolution spanning 6.7 inches. Because of the relatively low pixel count for the size, jagged edges of text, icons and graphics are a bit more readily apparent than on big phones with quad-HD panels, though that’s somewhat forgivable for this price.The A71 also lacks a fast-refresh panel, like you get on the 90Hz OnePlus Nord or 120Hz Galaxy S20. This isn’t a massive nor surprising loss, again considering the price, though high refresh rates are appearing in cheaper and cheaper phones, and OnePlus has broken the $500 barrier with the new Nord. The A71’s screen feels pretty run-of-the-mill by comparison.That said, this isn’t a poor display by any means. It gets reasonably bright, topping out at 481 nits under our light meter. It also delivers strong hues, particularly if you opt for its Vivid color profile. The trailer for the upcoming Christopher Nolan film, Tenet, showcased the A71’s impressive dynamic range as I watched flashes of sunlight glint off waves crashing up against a coastal Mediterranean town.Indeed, the A71’s panel can display a vast range of colors, as it rendered 200.3% of the sRGB color space in our testing. If you find that too saturated, you can always step down to the Natural color profile for a bit less pop. Meanwhile, the A71’s Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.33 is a bit behind the Pixel 4a (0.29) and further back from the iPhone SE (0.20). (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)On the back of the Galaxy A71 are four cameras: a 64-megapixel wide-angle lens, 12MP ultra wide, 5MP macro and 5MP depth sensor. Three of those, apart from the 64MP primary camera, are the same as what you’ll find in the Galaxy A51 I tested back in May; the only notable upgrade here is that main lens, which uses pixel binning to produce optimized 16-MP images.Overall, the A71’s photography is serviceable, if not stunning. Comparing it to our top cheap camera phone, the new Pixel 4a, the A71 certainly delivers a brighter shot here though I wouldn’t necessarily say it looks better. There’s some detail missing in the white fringes of the flower’s petals. The Pixel’s camera picks up these specular highlights, which conveys a sense of texture and depth. Samsung’s chronic insistence on banishing shadows and contrast doesn’t help in that regard, either.A similar comparison using a different flower, this time against the iPhone SE, yielded similar results. Apple’s imaging tech churns out astonishing detail here, thanks to processes like Deep Fusion, which leverages the power of the iPhone SE’s A13 Bionic chip to combine many exposures into one before picking out the sharpest aspects of each. The A71 can’t convey the petals’ texture with the same stunning granularity even as it plays up the highlights, and the natural bokeh of the background is less consistent and exquisite as well.You could argue that the A71’s primary appeal to photographers, then, will be the plethora of perspectives it offers, rather than the individual quality of any of its four lenses. That’s a position I’d agree with, as neither the iPhone SE nor the Pixel 4a features secondary ultra wide and macro lenses designed for shooting expansive landscapes or hyper close-ups. Granted, I’m not sure anyone really needs a macro camera — the A71’s does indeed let you capture images from mere inches away, though the quality isn’t anything that would cause me to beg for one in my next smartphone.Additionally, the computational photography on display in Samsung’s midrange devices still can’t compare with what’s offered in Google’s more affordable alternative. The A71’s Night Mode clearly loses here to the Pixel 4a’s Night Sight, which was able to capture an image that was simultaneously less noisy and more visible than anything Samsung’s device could muster. The Pixel can also paint more definition and color in the highlights on the house’s siding and through the window, contributing to a more balanced shot overall.Even though the A71 features a 32-MP front-facing camera, the selfies it takes don’t necessarily seem any sharper to me than what the iPhone SE delivers. As it turns out, that’s because the Galaxy uses pixel binning through the front lens as well, though I can’t say that’s done anything for this Portrait Mode selfie of yours truly. My skin tone is totally washed out through Samsung’ shooter, even though both pictures you see here were taken outside on a sunny afternoon. Additionally, I’m floored by the detail the iPhone SE lends to my shirt — intricacies of the fabric that the A71 glosses over. At least Samsung’s device fared slightly better with the bokeh, especially around my hair.Inside the Galaxy A71 5G is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765 processor, which is also appearing in other moderately-priced 5G phones these days. (The new OnePlus Nord uses a similar 765G chip better optimized for gaming.)In the A71, the Snapdragon 765 is tied to 8GB of RAM, delivering great overall performance — even if its showing in benchmarks is markedly short of Qualcomm's faster 8-series silicon.Whether browsing the web, working on Google Docs or generally thumbing around Android, the A71 handles basic tasks with ease and gives away nothing in performance to more high-end phones. It's only when you play a game that the Snapdragon 765's limits are tested.Arcade racer Asphalt 9 ran smoothly enough at its default medium graphics option, though frame rates decreased steeply when I ratcheted the experience up to a more demanding setting, and the back of the device started to heat up as well. You can dabble in serious gaming with the A71, but avid players ought to look elsewhere for the best gaming phone.Overall, though, the A71’s performance is sufficient. When I reviewed the $399 Galaxy A51, I came away amazed how often that phone could be so easily flummoxed by routine situations, like unlocking and launching apps. The A71 isn't plagued by those hiccups at all, and I'd much more confidently recommend it for that reason.The A71 holds its own in benchmarks, scoring 1,796 points in the multi-core portion of the system-wide Geekbench 5 test. That’s a bit faster than the Pixel 4a, which topped out at 1,647, though unsurprisingly far off the mark compared to 865-powered phones like the OnePlus 8, which reached 3,387 points — never mind the 3,226 score of the A13 Bionic-powered iPhone SE.In terms of graphics performance, the A71 was less than half as quick as the OnePlus 8, recording 551 frames at 8.6 frames per second in GFX Bench’s Aztec Ruins Vulkan test for high-tier devices. The OnePlus 8 recorded 1,322 frames at 21 fps.The 4,500-mAh battery inside the Galaxy A71 lasted an average of 10 hours and 49 minutes in Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where the device endlessly loaded web pages over a mobile connection while set to 150 nits of screen brightness until running out of juice.That’s a shade behind the OnePlus 8 (11:04) and iPhone 11 (11:20), but still good for a sub-$600 phone and ahead of the average smartphone. The Pixel 4a and iPhone SE, two sub-$400 phones we love, managed just 8:55 and 9:18, respectively.Not only does the Galaxy A71 last longer on a charge than the Pixel 4a and iPhone SE — it charges faster, too, with an included 25-watt adapter that reaches 60% in just 30 minutes. Fast charging can be rare to find on cheaper handsets (and even more expensive ones, as the iPhone 11 only comes with a slow 5-watt brick), so it’s nice to see Samsung include the best available charging tech for the A71 in the box.Samsung’s One UI 2.0 front end is based upon Android 10, and appears in the Galaxy A71 pretty much unchanged from how it looks and feels in the company’s pricier Galaxy S and Note models.One UI adds some useful features, like the ability to take scrolling screenshots and create secure, password-protected folders, though it can also be a bit overwrought. The sleep/wake key, for example, which you’d typically expect to power off the device when held down, simply brings up Bixby by default. You can change this in the settings, though it’s a maddening trend of Samsung phones that continues in the A71.There was also a glut of pre-installed apps on our AT&T unit. I counted 25, spanning everything from AT&T services to Amazon, Pluto TV, HBO Max, Final Fantasy XV and Monopoly. To make matters worse, much of this software appears in the daily briefing page to the left of the home screen, leading to a never-ending scrolling list of updates from apps like Giphy and PopSugar that read more like tabloid clickbait than genuinely useful news and information. There’s simply too much going on, and you get the sense it’s all been done to serve Samsung and its partners first, and the user second.Again, many of these apps and design decisions that make One UI somewhat cumbersome to navigate can be turned off or adjusted. But I really wish Samsung was more proactive in giving users control and choice over which apps to install and which cards to include on the daily feed right out of the box. After all, $600 isn’t an insignificant sum of money — for that price, I think a customer deserves to have a bit more say in what’s on their phone, and they shouldn’t have to rummage through options and menus to get it.If your upper limit to spend on a phone is $600, you could do much worse than the Samsung Galaxy A71 5G. For less than you’d spend on an iPhone 11, you’re getting a huge and dazzling AMOLED display along with 5G connectivity and great battery life.The problem for the A71 is that today there are a handful of much cheaper phones that exceed it in key areas. The Pixel 4a has a much better camera, way less frustrating and bloated software and similar performance for $250 less. The iPhone SE has the fastest mobile chipset on the planet that can run circles around the A71 and will last you many years longer; it also has a better camera, wireless charging and water resistance, and it too is $200 cheaper.Then there’s the OnePlus Nord — for those in countries where OnePlus sells it, anyway — which equals the A71 in many respects. It has the same number of cameras on the back, the same CPU inside and even supports 5G. But the Nord is better designed and better equipped with flagship features, like a 90Hz display, even though it comes in roughly $100 under the A71.You may be noticing a theme here. If the A71 5G cost $500 instead of $600, it’d be hard to turn down. But it’s a bit too pricey for what it is. Flagship smartphones may be getting progressively more expensive, but a select few phone makers are delivering the finest cheap phones we’ve ever seen. The Galaxy A71 5G, respectable though it is, is neither here nor there."
85,Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-pixel-2-pixel-2-xl-review,review-4755.html","Update: Google has discontinued the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, although you can buy them used. We recommend the newer Google Pixel 4a. The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are anything but conformists. Unlike with other flagship phones, you won't find dual-lens cameras or edge-to-edge screens on these handsets.Instead, Google focused on making these the smartest smartphones ever. And based on my testing, the new Pixels aptly fit that description, with a versatile Google Assistant you can now summon with a squeeze and a new object-recognition feature in the camera app that's truly impressive.""Send it back — it still needs more bezel!"" That’s how I imagine the insane conversation about the regular Pixel 2 took place at Google's headquarters. At a time when other phones are stretching their screens to reach practically from one corner to the other, the front of the Pixel 2 is a throwback in the worst possible sense of the word.I measured the top and bottom bezels at over 0.6 inches, compared to 0.2 inches for the Galaxy S8. Seeing that gorgeous 5-inch OLED screen sandwiched between such large blocks of black glass is downright offensive.It's not all bad news, though, as the two front-firing stereo speakers get nice and loud, offering richer audio than the speaker on the bottom edge of the Galaxy S8. Plus, if you're adamant that a phone be easy to use with one hand, you'll prefer the Pixel 2's more-compact dimensions of 5.7 x 2.7 x 0.3 inches, versus 6.2 x 3 x 0.3 inches for the Pixel 2 XL. The Pixel 2 weighs a fairly light 5 ounces, compared to 6.2 ounces for the Pixel 2 XL.The Pixel 2 XL also has a much more modern vibe, as its 6-inch display covers much more of the phone's face. The top and bottom bezels measure a more eye-pleasing 0.4 inches and 0.35 inches thick, respectively. This handset also sports stereo speakers above and below the screen.Around back, you'll find Google’s trademark two-tone design on both phones, with a stripe of black glass across the top around the camera and flash, and sturdy aluminum covering the bottom three-quarters of the phones. The fingerprint sensor is positioned right in the center, beneath the stripe, making it easy to reach.Google offers a range of colors for the Pixel 2, including Just Black, Clearly White, Black and White (which reminds us of the cookie), and Kinda Blue. The Pixel 2 XL comes in Just Black and Black and White.Unfortunately, neither the Pixel 2 nor the Pixel 2 XL features a headphone jack. Google includes a USB-C dongle in the box, but you're probably better off just going wireless.We tested the Google Pixel 2 XL’s toughness by dropping it on its face onto wood from a height of 4 feet and 6 feet; we then dropped it on its edge and face onto concrete from 4 feet; we then dropped it on its edge and face from 6 feet onto concrete.The Pixel 2 XL survived drops from 4 and 6 feet onto wood with no issues. However, when this phone landed on its face from 4 feet onto concrete, the screen cracked, obscuring the front camera.An edge drop from 6 feet didn't do too much more damage, but a face drop from that height caused half the screen to go black. As a result, the Pixel 2 XL earned a fairly weak toughness score of 4.3 out of 10.To see the results of other smartphones, as well as our complete scoring methodology, check out our smartphone drop tests.When I first heard about Active Edge on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, I thought it was a gimmick. But after using it just for a few minutes, I changed my mind. With a firm, quick squeeze toward the bottom of the phone, you can activate Google Assistant, which is faster and more accurate and versatile than Siri.For instance, I said, ""Play BoJack Horseman on my living room TV,"" and Google Assistant on the Pixel 2 launched the Netflix app right to this deranged cartoon on my big screen. Of course, it helps that I had a Chromecast plugged in to the set, but that's exactly Google's plan: to show you how its hardware and software work well together across its growing ecosystem of products. The Google-owned Nest thermostat also works with Google Assistant, so you could say, ""Set the temperature to 68 degrees.""With the Assistant just a squeeze away, I had no problem finding out how the Yankees were doing against the Astros (not great), telling the Pixel 2 to snap a selfie, summoning up all the photos I took that day, or firing up my Liked from Radio Playlist on Spotify. Sure, I could do all of this by saying, ""OK, Google,"" first, but I found it more convenient and less awkward to use Active Edge.You can also adjust the sensitivity level of the squeeze required and allow the Active Edge feature to work when the screen is off. I rarely activated the Assistant by accident.While Apple charges $999 for the privilege of owning a colorful OLED display and enjoying its wide viewing angles and perfect blacks on the iPhone X, and while the OLED Galaxy S8 starts at $750, you can get this screen tech on the Pixel 2 for $649The Pixel 2's 5-inch screen isn't the sharpest, at 1920 x 1080 pixels, and it's much smaller than the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8, but it produced an excellent 148 percent of the sRGB color gamut. When I watched the Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer on the Pixel 2's display, the golden orange around the insanely cute porg's eyes popped against its white fur, and the reflection of two clashing weapons in Captain Phasma's gleaming, silver helmet looked gorgeous.The Pixel 2 XL's 6-inch screen sports a sharper, 2880 x 1440-pixel resolution. This panel registered a slightly lower 130 percent of the color gamut, but its colors are just about as accurate on paper. The Pixel 2 XL's display scored 0.26 on the Delta-E error test (0 is perfect), and the Pixel 2 hit 0.29.The Pixel 2 XL's had some issues at launch. We found that there is a blue tint present on the Pixel 2 XL's panel at off-angles and that there was some graininess when viewing solid colored backgrounds. The Pixel 2 XL was also reportedly suffering from burn-in issues, with the icons at the bottom of the display staying on the screen even when they're not supposed to be present.MORE: The Best Smartphones You Can Buy TodayFortunately, a new update from Google provided more saturated hues via a new mode, and it should also mitigate burn-in.The Pixel 2 XL is the phone you want to have outdoors, as it registered a higher 438 nits on our light meter, compared to just 346 nits on the Pixel 2. The Galaxy S8 notched 437 nits. The smartphone category average is 433.Similar to the Galaxy S8 and Note 8, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL offer always-on displays, which show you the time and notifications at a glance. But the new Pixels go even further, with a Now Playing feature that can recognize music playing in the background and automatically display the title and artist.From there, you can double tap the track to learn more about the song or to play it. It sometimes took 30 seconds or more for Now Playing to kick in, but it's not designed to replace Shazam; it's more about serendipitous discovery.While the cameras on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL take great-looking images, that's not what really makes the photo experience stand out. That would be Google Lens, an object-detection feature in the Camera and in Google Photos app.With Google Lens, the Pixel 2 can recognize landmarks with ease, such as the Flatiron Building in New York City. I just snapped a photo, then tapped on the lens icon on the bottom of the screen; Google Assistant then displayed an information card on the building with info from Wikipedia.I had mixed results when taking pictures of businesses. After I took a shot of the neon sign for Gleason's Tavern, Google Assistant gave the the star rating and a brief description of the establishment, along with its hours of operation. But Google Lens didn't recognize the sign for Dough, which is a premium donut shop.Google Lens worked pretty well on a business card; the phone easily picked up the email address of the contact and his phone number. Last but not least, I tried photographing a Spider-Man Homecoming movie poster, and the phone returned a synopsis and rating from Rotten Tomatoes.Google Lens will be coming to other Android phones later, but for now at least, it's a Pixel exclusive.There's one other camera feature that's coming that I did not have a chance to test, which is AR stickers. With this perk, you'll be able to insert characters from franchises like Stranger Things and Star Wars right into your images.Considering the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL sport single rear 12-megapixel cameras, you might think that they're snapping pics with one arm tied around their backs compared to dual-lens camera phones. Nope. They aren't, and that's because these phones are smart enough to offer a Portrait mode (bokeh effect) through software that works even on the phones' front 8-MP camera.In one portrait I took of my colleague Cortney with the Pixel 2, the New York City skyline blurred into the background, but not too much — just enough for her red-orange hair, blue shirt and green jacket to pop. As I zoomed in, though, I noticed that one part of a building behind her didn't have the blur effect. It's too bad that you can't preview Portrait Mode results in real time, as you can with the iPhone 8 and Galaxy Note 8; the bokeh effect is applied after you take the shot.In terms of overall image quality, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 Plus give the best camera phone, the iPhone 8 Plus, a run for its money. But they don't surpass it.In this shot of the Flatiron Building, the Pixel 2's HDR+ setting brought out more details in the shadows than the iPhone 8 Plus did. The iPhone's image has a bit better contrast, but overall, the Pixel 2's image is the one I would share on Facebook or Instagram.The iPhone 8 Plus pulled ahead with this shot of an outdoor art piece. The iPhone 8 Plus delivered a brighter image with more vibrant oranges, blues, purples and pinks.Indoors, at the Lego store, it was a toss-up between the Pixel 2 and iPhone 8 Plus. The image of a Lego man in a top hat captured by Google's phone delivered more-realistic hues, while Apple's camera delivered a brighter image.The iPhone 8 Plus won on this close-up of a lantana flower. The image turned out brighter than the Pixel 2 XL's shot, making it easier to tell that the sun was shining, although I could make out a great amount of detail in the leaves on both photos.If you're an Android fan and you've been jealous of Apple's Live Photos, you'll get a kick out of the Motion photos feature on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 Plus. It captures a few seconds of video with each image and plays it back with a loop-like effect, as I noticed in one shot I took that had moving cars in the foreground.With the same Snapdragon 835 processor as the Galaxy S8 and the same 4GB of RAM as the Galaxy S8 and S8+, the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL might be expected to offer the same performance. Actually, they're faster in real-world tasks.On our video-editing test, in which we transcode a 2-minute 4K video clip to 1080p in the Adobe Clips app, the Pixel 2 took 2 minutes and 55 seconds, compared to 4:07 for the Galaxy S8. The Galaxy Note 8 took 3:03, and that phone packs 6GB of RAM. The Pixel 2 still wasn't nearly as fast as the iPhone 8 and its A11 Bionic chip, which needed 42 seconds.Next, we opened up a 5.1 MB PDF file. The Pixel 2 took just 2 seconds, compared to nearly 6.41 seconds for the Galaxy Note 8. The iPhone 8 took 0.74 seconds.The Pixel 2 didn't fare as well on synthetic benchmarks. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Pixel 2 notched 6,282. That's a little bit behind the Galaxy S8's score (6,295) and well short of the Galaxy Note 8's showing (6,564). The iPhone 8 was in another league, at 10,170.When performing everyday tasks, like running two apps side by side in split-screen mode, the Pixel 2 felt snappy and responsive. I played the demanding Warhammer 40,000: Freeblade game — busting up tanks with my mech — without any lag.Both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL beat their Apple and Samsung foes in endurance. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE (in this case on Verizon), the Pixel 2 lasted a strong 11 hours and 7 minutes. The Pixel 2 XL lasted about an hour longer, at 12:09.These runtimes far surpass the 9:40 smartphone average, and they beat the respective times of the iPhone 8 (9:54) and iPhone 8 Plus (11:16) and the Galaxy S8 (10:39) and Galaxy S8+ (11:04).The Pixel 2 XL easily makes our list of the longest-lasting phones. Plus, you can expect even longer battery life should you choose T-Mobile for your Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL, as we've found that phones tend to last longer on that network.One bummer, though, is that neither the Pixel 2 nor the Pixel 2 XL supports wireless charging. You'll need to plug in a USB-C cable if you want juice. Google claims that you'll get up to 7 hours of power in just 15 minutes. On our tests, we saw the Pixel 2 get up to 19 percent capacity in just 10 minutes, reaching 39 percent by the 30-minute mark.It's no surprise that Google's own phones are the first to ship with the new Android Oreo software installed. The updated OS doesn't offer dramatic improvements, but there are some worthwhile new features.The new picture-in-picture mode isn't one of them. Although you can already run two apps side by side, picture-in-picture lets you exit an app and still see a floating window of one of the supported apps, such as YouTube and Google Maps. In the case of YouTube, you need to be signed up for YouTube Red ($9.99 per month) for this feature to work. I was able to easily drag a small window of the playback window around the screen as I worked in another app, but I just didn't see it as very practical.I found the app shortcuts feature, which is similar to the 3D Touch feature on iOS, more useful. You long press an app icon to activate various shortcuts without having to open the app; for instance, you can long press the Phone app to quickly dial one of your top three contacts, or long press the Camera app to Take a video or Take a selfie.Similarly helpful are the notification dots. When you log press an icon that has a dot on the upper right corner, you'll see the waiting notification without having to open the app. This came in handy for the Gmail app.With Google's new ARCore initiative, compelling augmented reality apps will be making their way to certain Android Oreo phones, such as the Galaxy S8. The apps will be hitting the Google Play store this winter.Oreo has lots of other features, including ones under the hood to optimize performance and battery life, as well as to enable stronger security. See our full Android Oreo review along with a look at the top 21 Oreo features.With a lot of phones, the accessories are an afterthought, but not with the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. The new Pixel Buds ($159) are wireless headphones that let you carry on a conversation with someone else in their native language. Leveraging Google Translate and Google Assistant, these headphones help you say phrases in any one of 40 languages, and your Pixel 2 will utter that phrase aloud so that the person you're speaking with can understand you.I did not have an opportunity to test out the Pixel Buds yet, but I look forward to it.Another new accessory on the way is Google Clips, a pricier $249 camera that you can attach to pretty much anything to record video of loved ones, allowing you to keep your hands free. Because it uses machine learning, the Clips camera not only knows when there's a person in the frame to take a shot, but it can also learn who your friends and family members are over time.If you're looking to get into virtual reality, there's also a new version of the Google Daydream View headset ($99), which offers improved comfort and optics with a wider sweet spot for content and increased resolution.With the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, it's clear that Google has chosen AI as its weapon of choice to fight the smartphone war. And given the company's prowess in machine learning, this is a smart move that has paid off. I found myself using Google Assistant a lot more in just a few days than I do Siri in a whole month with the iPhone, and not just because I was testing the new Pixels. Google Assistant understood me even when I didn't utter the exact right words, and I loved being able to summon it with just a squeeze.If you own other Google gear, such as the Google Home Mini (which you can get for free right now when you order the Pixel 2) or Chromecast, the Assistant's powers multiply. In a way, Google is starting to pull away from other Android phone makers, because the company is creating its own Apple-like walled garden. It's a more purposeful fragmentation.The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL also benefit from faster performance than the Galaxy S8, stellar front and back cameras and long battery life. Overall, I prefer the sleeker designs and curved edge-to-edge displays on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+, and the iPhone 8 Plus remains the king of camera phones. But if you want a pure Android experience, you'll love the $849 Pixel 2 XL. The Pixel 2's bezels are just way too big and it's screen too small for me to take this phone seriously, even for its relatively low $649.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
86,OnePlus 8,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-8,"OS: Android 10 with OxygenOS Display: 6.55-inch AMOLED (2400 x 1080), 90Hz CPU: Snapdragon 865 RAM: 8GB, 12GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB Rear cameras: 48MP main (f/1.7), 16MP ultra wide angle (f/2.2), 2MP macro camera Front camera: 16MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 4,300 mAh Charging speed: 30 watts (included charger) Size: 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches Weight: 6.3 ouncesOnePlus has always courted a reputation as the phone maker you turn to when you don't want to spend big bucks on premium features. That's as true as ever with the OnePlus 8, especially as OnePlus courts the high-end of the smartphone market with its more fully featured — and higher-priced — OnePlus 8 Pro.The OnePlus 8 lacks some of the flashier capabilities found in its upward-climbing sibling, but it's still one of the best Android phones. It boasts a top-of-the-line processor, big battery and gorgeous display. Just as important, OnePlus has reined in the price on this model. It's not a bargain on the level of the OnePlus Nord — assuming you can get your hands on that budget phone — but the OnePlus 8 proves you don't have to put up four figures to enjoy a top Android phone.Are the tradeoffs you have to make for the OnePlus 8's comparatively lower price worth it? Our OnePlus 8 review finds that they generally are, though fans of superior mobile photography may be put off by some of this phone's compromises.The OnePlus 8 costs $699, which gives you a phone with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. To bump the memory to 12GB and double the storage to 256GB, you'll need to pay an extra $100. The phone goes on sale at Amazon and on OnePlus' website on April 29.The $699 price for the OnePlus 8 is noteworthy, in light of the $899 OnePlus is charging for the OnePlus 8 Pro. By scaling back some of the features in this new round of flagship phones, OnePlus can still offer a device that costs the same as the iPhone 11 and a full $300 less than the Galaxy S20. (We've got an in-depth breakdown on what features you're giving up in our OnePlus 8 vs. OnePlus 8 Pro comparison.)Both T-Mobile and Verizon sell the phone. You’ll pay a little bit extra for the phone at Verizon, where a version that works on the carrier's 5G network costs $799. That works out to $33.33 a month over 24 months of payments. Before you buy the OnePlus 8 at Verizon, you should know that it has a different design than other OnePlus 8 models to accommodate the antenna needed to connect to Verizon's 5G network. That means cases that fit other OnePlus 8 models won't fit the version Verizon sells.As for T-Mobile, it's selling the phone for $699, or $29.17 a month if you spread out payments over 24 months. A deal at T-Mobile lets you get the phone for half off if you trade in an eligible phone or open a new line with the carrier. (Find other OnePlus 8 deals in our guide on how to order the OnePlus 8.)Because the OnePlus 8 includes a 5G modem, you'll be able to use the phone on those carriers' 5G networks where available — though only the Verizon variant will support millimeter-wave connectivity for the fastest speeds possible.Advertisement by The VELCRO® BrandBe creative with VELCRO® Brand original solutions perfectly suited for your next project.Cheaper 5G-capable phones have come out since our OnePlus 8 review first appeared, highlighted by the OnePlus Nord, which costs less than $500. For now, though, that phone is only available in India and Europe, as OnePlus mulls whether to make the Nord available here. To get a cheaper 5G phone than the OnePlus 8, you'd have to turn to a device like the 5G option of the Samsung Galaxy A51, which is now on sale for $549 at Verizon.If you've been following OnePlus' most recent phone releases, you'll notice some changes with the look of the OnePlus 8. The pop-up selfie cam from the OnePlus 7 Pro is gone, as is the OnePlus 7T's teardrop notch housing the front camera. Instead, the selfie cam now resides in a punch-hole cutout in the upper left corner of the OnePlus 8's display. And while the top and bottom bezels are still there, they're also as thin as they can be, so that OnePlus can maximize screen real estate on this 6.55-inch phone.Another departure from the look of past OnePlus phones is a switch to a curved screen on the OnePlus 8, where the edges of the display wrap around the tops of the phone's sides. It certainly creates a striking look for this phone, and it makes the OnePlus 8 easier to grip than phones with flat screens and rounded edges that seem to slip out of my hands with alarming frequency. Unfortunately, the curved edges also makes it easy to inadvertently tap a part of the OnePlus 8's screen when all you're trying to do is hold or pick up the phone. I've launched more than one app I had no plans of tapping during my time with the phone.For a phone with such a big screen, the OnePlus 8 doesn't take up that much space, at least when it comes to width. At 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches, OnePlus' phone is taller than the iPhone 11 (5.94 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches) and Galaxy S20 (5.9 x 3 x 0.31 inches), though not as wide. With 8mm of thickness, the OnePlus 8 is also fractionally thinner than Apple's iPhone 11, so you'll have minimal trouble slipping the OnePlus device into a pocket. At 6.3 ounces, it's lighter than the iPhone 11, too, though not as light as the 5.7-ounce S20.Where OnePlus has Samsung beat involves color options. Samsung's latest phones opt for some pretty conventional color schemes, but the OnePlus 8 mixes things up with a choice between the cool tint of Glacial Green and the shifting colorway of Interstellar Glow. I reviewed the latter color and I appreciated how the Gorilla Glass back of the OnePlus 8 scaled from cool purple hues at the top of the phone to a warm pink at the bottom — an effect not unlike the sky at sunset. Your conventional sunset is less likely to pick up as many fingerprints and smudges as the back of the OnePlus 8, though.Instead of the bulging square camera bump that's become commonplace on flagship phones these days, OnePlus sticks the three rear lenses in a vertical array down the upper center of the phone. I'm less likely to put my fingers over the OnePlus 8's camera when I hold the phone in landscape mode this way. The lenses do stick out noticeably from the back of the phone, though.OnePlus has made much of the fact that the OnePlus 8 Pro is the first of its phones to have an IP rating (IP68 to be exact, which means can be submerged in up to 5 feet of water for 30 minutes without damage). There's no such designation on the OnePlus 8, at least not on the unlocked version I'm using. (Carrier versions of the phone may be a different story.) It's a bit of a bummer you have to sacrifice this peace of mind for the less expensive of OnePlus's new flagships.If you pay up for the $899 OnePlus 8 Pro, you can enjoy a screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus 8 users, however, must make do with a 90Hz refresh rate — which also happens to be noticeably faster than the 60Hz rate found on most phones these days.I honestly don't think that this is much of a tradeoff between the two versions of the OnePlus 8. Yes, the Pro model features smoother scrolling and it has an MEMC mode to upscale Netflix and YouTube videos to 120 frames per second. But whatever improved scrolling you get from 120Hz vs. 90Hz escaped my eye when I used a Galaxy S20 Plus (with its 120Hz refresh rate turned on) alongside the OnePlus 8's 90Hz screen. In other words, the OnePlus 8 lets you enjoy the benefits of faster scrolling at a lower overall price. And you don't have to downscale the resolution on your OnePlus 8 to enjoy this feature the way you do on Samsung's S20 phones.With a maximum brightness of 1,100 nits, the OnePlus 8's AMOLED screen is plenty bright enough to see in bright sunlight. When I went out to shoot photos with the phone, I never had to max out the brightness (and drain the battery faster) to see the OnePlus 8's on-screen controls.Watching trailers for both No Time to Die and Cats on both the OnePlus 8 and Galaxy S20 Plus, I thought the OnePlus 8 matched up well against Samsung's more expensive phone in the color department. Colors looked a little more vibrant on the S20 Plus, but they also had a bluish cast, particularly when James Bond or assorted Jellicle cats were skulking around in darker scenes of their respective movies.Our test numbers bear that out. The OnePlus 8 registers 155.7% of the sRGB color spectrum, which isn't as much as the S20 Plus' 222.4% result (though it does beat the iPhone 11's 113% tally). But colors are more accurate on the OnePlus 8, which has a Delta-E rating of 0.25, compared to 0.36 for the Galaxy S20 Plus. A score of zero is perfect on this test. You're getting an excellent display with the OnePlus 8 that captures color well.A bigger tradeoff that OnePlus 8 owners have to make, at least compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro, concerns the cameras. While the Pro model features four lenses, the OnePlus 8 sports only three — and one of those isn’t a telephoto lens. Instead, the 48-megapixel main shooter with its f/175 aperture and 16MP ultra wide camera are joined by a 2MP macro lens. That's great, in theory, for taking detailed objects, but if you want to zoom in, you're at the mercy of a digital zoom that can add noise to your shots.If you shoot a lot of photos where you can get up close and personal with your subject, the macro lens may come in handy, but I'd rather have a good zoom lens on my phone. If a phone does come equipped with a macro lens, I wish it performed more consistently than the one on the OnePlus 8.While this close-up shot of a tulip arrangement captures the folds and patterns of the purple tulip's leaf, too many of the macro shots I took with the OnePlus 8 had too much of a blur that I didn't notice until I was able to look at my photos on a larger screen than the phone's viewfinder. There's probably an art to taking macro shots, but the OnePlus 8 certainly doesn't help you discover it.As for the lack of a telephoto lens, you see the disadvantage OnePlus 8 is working at when you stack it up against a phone capable of an optical zoom like the Galaxy S20 Plus. (The lower cost S20 would be a better comparison to the OnePlus 8, but the S20 Plus is what I have on hand during this time of sheltering in place.)This shot of the Oakland skyline from across the San Leandro Channel shot at a 2x zoom looks generally the same on the OnePlus 8, as it does on the S20. But focus in on the buildings in the background, and you can see that they stand out more sharply in the Samsung phone's rendering. The S20 Plus also captures more gradients of blue in the spring sky.The more you zoom in, though, the greater the disparity becomes. The OnePlus 8 maxes out at a 10x digital zoom, and by that point, the photo looks like nothing you'd care to share — everything's fuzzy and out of focus and the colors are decidedly muted. The S20 Plus can use lossless zoom to still deliver a focused photo where Oakland's Tribune Tower pops out against the sky and you can clearly read the Wells Fargo sign on the building next to it. If you count on your camera phone to zoom in for more details, you'll want to look beyond the OnePlus 8.The OnePlus 8 makes a better show of it when you're turning to its other lenses for photos. OnePlus' phone did a decent job with this jar of multicolored jellybeans on my porch, though it struggles with figuring out where the glass jar ends and the mass of jelly beans begins. The Galaxy S20 Plus does a better job distinguishing between those two objects, even if it has a warmer color cast than I think is accurate.Note that the OnePlus 8 uses pixel-binning with its main lens to present 12MP photos with better dynamic range. You have the option to switch to 48MP photos, though that feature works best in brightly lit scenes. In the case of the jelly bean jar, you get a photo that's closer to what the S20 Plus shoots by default, with less glare from the glass jar.The OnePlus 8 seems to have trouble focusing with some photos as I found out when photographing a bowl of pork belly that whipped up for dinner. The glaze on the pork glistens in the OnePlus 8 shot, though you can't really make out the individual grains of rice that the S20 Plus had a better time capturing. More significantly, the kale salad in the background of the OnePlus 8 shot is clearly out of focus, and not in an artistic way. It's just a mass of green, whereas the S20 Plus is able to keep both the main dish and the salad in sharp contrast.To see how the OnePlus's ultra wide angle lens fares, I went to a nearby shoreline to take a photo of a statue in front of some houseboats. I actually like the OnePlus 8's effort here, as it produced a bright, well-composed shot that matches up well against the Galaxy S20 Plus' output. The S20 Plus darkens the scene a little too dramatically for my tastes, while the OnePlus accurately reflects what a sunny day it was when I took these photos.Switching to the wide angle, though, the OnePlus 8 falters. The formerly bright colors are now fairly dull. Compare the yellow trim on the houseboat — it pops in the S20's photo, while it looks muted in the OnePlus 8 shot. The angle on the S20 Plus is also wider, capturing more background detail.There are few instances where the OnePlus 8 outperformed the Galaxy S20. The OnePlus 8's Nightscape mode, for example, does a superlative job in low-light. A mural on a local shop is still heavily detailed in the OnePlus 8's photo, even if the flowers in the upper right color got a little washed out. (The S20 Plus struggled with those flowers as well.) The S20 Plus, while showing more coloration in the night sky, also imposes too warm of a cast, while the cool look of the OnePlus 8's shot feels like a better representation of the scene.Neither phone really stood out with their attempts to take a portrait of my daughter, though I think the OnePlus 8 has the better overall shot. It struggles separating her hair from the background blur, catching more than a few strands in the bokeh effect. But the colors are more accurate and vibrant, even if the OnePlus 8 has a little bit of trouble with shadows on this bright, sunny day. The S20 Plus removed all the color from my daughter's face, as both phones got over-aggressive with smoothing out her skin.That same aggression with removing any blemish or freckle appears again when we switch over to the 16MP selfie cam on the front of the OnePlus 8. Like the Galaxy S20 Plus, OnePlus' camera software wants to make my skin look as smooth as possible, accuracy be damned. I think the OnePlus 8 shot better reflects my skin tone than the S20 Plus, which makes it look like I'm wearing bronzer. The background blur in the S20's photo is more stylish, though.My testing of the OnePlus 8's video capture capabilities hasn't been as extensive, but so far I like what I've seen. By default, you shoot video at 1080p/30fps resolution, though if you dig into settings, you can upgrade to 4K video at 60fps. (Be prepared to eat up a lot of storage space if you do that.) Video I shot of my daughter running to and fro appeared steady, which I'll credit to the OnePlus 8's hybrid stabilization that taps into both OIS and EIS technologies.Like the other leading Android phones coming out this year, the OnePlus 8 features Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 system-on-chip, which promises better performance and more efficient power consumption than the Snapdragon 855 that powered the previous OnePlus flagships. (Since our review, phones using the Snapdragon 865 Plus, such as the Galaxy Note 20, have come out, and they figure to outperform their 865-powered counterparts.) OnePlus augments that chipset with either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. Our OnePlus 8 review unit featured 12GB of RAM alongside 256GB of onboard storage.That extra RAM gave the OnePlus 8 a boost when we ran Geekbench 5, a test that measures overall performance. The OnePlus 8's multicore score of 3,387 landed squarely among the top-performing Android phones we've seen this year — ahead of the Galaxy S20 (3,147), but behind the LG V60 ThinQ 5G (3,420). More impressively, the OnePlus 8 beat the iPhone 11's multicore Geekbench 5 score of 3,251, showing that the gap between iPhones and leading Android devices grows smaller all the time — at least when you pack your Android phones full of RAM. (The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max handily bested the OnePlus 8's multicore result, while the iPhone 11 had a better single-core result — 1,333 versus 920 for the OnePlus 8.)On the graphics front, the OnePlus 8 delivered comparable results to other Snapdragon 865-powered phones, producing a score of 1,322 frames (21 frames per second) on the GFX Bench Aztec Ruins Vulkan test. That's in line with what we saw from the Galaxy S20 (1,319) and LG V60 (1,313), but behind the iPhone 11 and its 1,481-frame (23 fps) result.The OnePlus 8 lagged other phones when it came to a real-world test where we use Adobe Premiere Rush to transcode a 4K video to 1080p after applying an effect and transition. It took the OnePlus 8 1 minute and 43 seconds to pull off that task — nearly 30 seconds behind the Galaxy S20's 1:15 time. The iPhone 11 continues to set the pace here with a 45-second result.When using the OnePlus 8 over a week-plus worth of testing, though, I didn't notice any lags in performance. I could switch between apps with ease and demanding games like PUBG Mobile played on the OnePlus 8 without any hiccups or stutters. Other phones may out-muscle the OnePlus 8, but you'll certainly get comparable performance from this OnePlus flagship without having to pay a comparable price.The OnePlus 8 comes with a 4,300-mAh battery — bigger than the 3,800-mAh power pack in the OnePlus 7T though not as large as the 4,510 mAh battery you'll get by paying up for the OnePlus 8 Pro. That shouldn't matter too much, as the OnePlus 8 delivers superlative battery life, though that result comes with a caveat.When we put the OnePlus 8 through the Tom's Guide battery test — that's continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network with the display set to 150 nits of brightness — the new OnePlus phone lasted an average of 11 hours and 4 minutes. The best phone battery life for the devices we've tested tops 11 hours, so the OnePlus 8 finds itself in rare company, even if recent flagships like the Galaxy S20 Ultra and LG V60 ThinQ outlast it.That 11 hour-plus time comes with the OnePlus 8's refresh rate set to 60Hz. Opt for the faster refresh speed, and battery life takes a hit. When we ran our battery test after setting the OnePlus 8's display to a 90Hz refresh rate, the average result dropped to 9 hours and 55 minutes, which is more in line with the average smartphone's performance. Losing an hour of battery life to enjoy one of the OnePlus 8's marquee features isn't ideal, but it's a tradeoff some users won't mind. It's also not as steep as the 3-hour difference we saw when testing the Galaxy S20 Ultra's battery with a 120Hz refresh rate turned on.OnePlus finally added wireless charging support to the OnePlus 8 Pro, but the standard OnePlus 8 model remains stuck in the past with only wired charging capabilities. At least that charging is ridiculously speedy, thanks to OnePlus' Warp Charge 30T technology. Using the included 30-watt charger, I routinely saw the OnePlus 8 go from a drained battery to a 68% charge after 30 minutes. The Galaxy S20 Plus and iPhone 11 Pro both hit 55% after 30 minutes of charging.The OnePlus 8 runs OxygenOS, an in-house version of Android 10 that adds a couple of new features like a dark mode that's compatible with more apps and optimized for better battery life. OnePlus has also introduced new dynamic wallpapers that shift tones based on ambient lighting.I think the highlight of the special features for the OnePlus 8, though, is the phone's in-display fingerprint sensor, a returning feature from past OnePlus flagships. The sensor's spot on the display is clearly shown with the outline of a fingerprint, and I find it more responsive and forgiving than similar features on the Galaxy S20 lineup.The OnePlus 8 also benefits from a facial recognition feature that's a lot quicker than the iPhone's Face ID, which scans your face to unlock your device but still requires you to swipe up to move past the lock screen. Glance at the OnePlus 8 and it will launch immediately. Of course, OnePlus' face unlocking feature isn't as secure as what Apple does with Face ID, which uses a 3D scan of your face to verify your identity. That might explain why I was able to unlock the OnePlus 8 while wearing a pandemic-inspired mask over my nose and mouth. That same mask was blocked by Face ID.Normally, I'm a big advocate of opting for the less expensive of the multiple models that phone makers put out. Plus, Pro and Ultra models have flashy features that appeal to power users, but rarely justify the added cost for most smartphone owners. And while the excellent display on the OnePlus 8 won't have users feeling short-changed, the better performing cameras on the OnePlus 8 Pro just might. As for how the OnePlus 8 measures up to devices beyond those made by OnePlus itself, there's a compelling case to be made for this flagship phone. The OnePlus 8 performs as well as any leading Android device and even makes the iPhone 11 sweat a little. You'll get very good battery life — at least when the phone's faster refresh rate isn't taxing the battery — and the color schemes on the OnePlus 8 help this phone stand out from a selection of increasingly indistinguishable black smartphones. The big question in any OnePlus 8 review comes down to the camera. If you want an Android phone that produces the best possible shots, you'll want to pay up for Samsung's Galaxy S20 models. But if you don't really make use of optical zooms and don't mind photos that don't measure up to what the best camera phones produce, the OnePlus 8 can save you anywhere from $100 to $300 on your next handset."
87,Moto G Stylus,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/moto-g-stylus,"The Moto G Stylus finds itself in a bit of a pickle. This mid-range phone debuts at the same time as both the Moto G Power and Moto G Fast. It should come as no surprise for a trio phones that come from the same manufacturer and sport similar price tags, that these handsets are essentially dead ringers for one another.The Moto G Stylus, Moto G Power and Moto G Fast share matching looks, identical screen sizes and the exact same mobile processors. But the Moto G Stylus trades in the Moto G Power's marquee feature — epic battery life — for a stylus. Think of this phone as kind of a discount version of Samsung's more extravagantly priced Galaxy Note 20, which just debuted for three times the price of the Moto G Stylus.Starting price: $299 OS: Android 10 Screen size (Resolution): 6.4-inch LCD (2300 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 665 RAM: 4GB Storage: 128GB Expandable: Yes, up to 512GB Rear Cameras: 48MP (f/1.7) main; 2MP (f/2.2) macro; 16MP (f/2.2) Action Cam Front Camera: 16MP (f/2.0) Battery Size: 4,000 mAh Battery Life (Hrs:Mins): 12:13 Size: 6.2 x 3 x 0.36 inches Weight: 6.8 ouncesHaving completed my Moto G Stylus review, I'm not sure the stylus-for-big-battery trade works out in this phone's favor. While the Moto G Stylus has some other features to recommend it, including a 48MP main camera and more built-in storage, I look at Moto's two new budget phones side-by-side and can't help but feel the Moto G Power has more to offer. The Moto G Stylus costs $299, a $50 premium over the Moto G Power, but less than the $399 iPhone SE, as well as the debut prices for Google's Pixel 3a and the Nokia 7.2.You can buy the phone directly from Motorola. It's also available from Best Buy, B&H Photo and Amazon. Carriers offering the Moto G Stylus include Verizon, Republic Wireless,  Google Fi and Metro by T-Mobile. It's not hard to find the Moto G Stylus at all.The Moto G Stylus looks so similar to the Moto G Power that, when reviewing the two devices, I would occasionally grab the wrong one. From the front, they look very similar, with their matching 6.4-inch displays surrounded by thin (though still noticeable) bezels and similar dimensions. The Moto G Stylus is 1.4 millimeters shorter and 0.4 millimeters thinner than the Moto G Power. The smaller battery inside the 6.8-ounce Moto G Stylus means it weighs 0.2 ounces less than its sibling.There's one chief difference in design between the two phones, and it's what gives the Moto G Stylus its name. The right corner of the phone houses a 3.8-inch stylus that you can pull out and use to jot down notes and spot-edit photos. The stylus remains in place securely until you dig it out via a little notch in the corner of the phone, at which point it slides out fairly easily.Flip over the Moto G Stylus and again, you get a similar look to the Moto G Power with a fingerprint sensor on the back middle of the device and three camera lenses that descend from the upper left corner. The Stylus looks a little flashier than its sibling, thanks to its Mystic Indigo color scheme that gives the phone a dark blue/almost purple sheen. But like the Moto G Power, the Moto G Stylus is made of plastic, so there's no mistaking that this is a budget phone.You'll find a 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom of the Moto G Stylus. Motorola says the phone has a ""water repellant design,"" meaning that splashes are OK, but dunks are most certainly not. There’s no IP rating here.You won't confuse the stylus included for Motorola's phone with the S Pen that's a highlight of Samsung's vastly more expensive Galaxy Note phones. On recent Note models, the S Pen has added Bluetooth connectivity, which enables features like using the stylus as a remote control for presentations, music playback and taking pictures. On Motorola's phone, the stylus is just a stylus — an input device used for scribbling on the screen. Still, the stylus on Motorola's new phone will come in handy for people who really want to scrawl things down at a moment's notice without even pausing to unlock their phone. Pull the stylus out of a locked, sleeping Moto G Stylus, and the phone immediately springs to life, launching a notes screen where you can jot, scribble and draw to your heart's content, using three different drawing tools and seven different colors. When you're done, you can save your scribbles to the included Moto Notes app. Restoring the stylus to its slot on the phone returns you to the Moto G Stylus lock screen.When the phone's awake, removing the stylus produces a shortcuts menu on the right side of the screen for creating notes in Moto Notes, sketches in Google Keep and snapping screenshots. (The screenshot tool captures the entire screen, but you have the option of editing it if there's a specific area you want to highlight or markup.)The stylus can also come in handy when you're editing photos. Like other recent Motorola phones, the Moto G Stylus' camera supports a Cinemagraph feature in which you can designate some areas of your still image to feature movement. Using the stylus I was able to mark off a much more precise area than I could using my finger to edit a Cinemagraph image.It's all pretty handy, but I found myself wishing the stylus could trigger more shortcuts on the Moto G Stylus.As with the Moto G Power, the display on the Moto G Stylus is the device's least appealing feature. It's an LCD panel — a trade-off we should all be willing to make for a sub-$300 phone — and the Full HD+ resolution of 2300 x 1080 is sharp enough for my eyes.The problem is color — they're simply not vibrant or bright enough on the Moto G Stylus’ display. While watching a No Time to Die trailer on YouTube, shadowy scenes looked extra dark and even those shot in bright sunlight looked rather muted. When I switched over to Dolemite Is My Name on Netflix, the G Stylus screen recreated the 1970s-style haze that the movie was shot in, but Eddie Murphy's garish outfits didn't look as vibrant as they have on other screens. Our lab testing found that the Moto G Stylus just doesn't show off a wide range of colors, with the phone registering 98% of the sRGB color gamut. While LCD screens don't tend to showcase colors to the degree that OLED panels do, the LCD-equipped iPhone SE captured 111.2% of that same spectrum. The TCL 10L — which has one of the best displays we've seen on an inexpensive phone was even more colorful, with 122.1%.The Moto G Stylus' colors were about as accurate as the Moto G Power, which had a Delta-E rating of 0.33 to the 0.32 rating of the Moto G Stylus. However, the TCL 10L is more accurate than either Motorola phone, with a Delta-E rating of 0.22. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)At least the Moto G Stylus screen is bright enough to see clearly in direct sunlight. Using a light meter, we measured 510 nits of brightness for the Moto G Stylus. That outshines the Pixel 3a (401 nits) and TCL 10L (422 nits), though the iPhone SE is brighter at 653. Still, I never had to dig into the Moto G Stylus' setting to crank up the display brightness when I took the phone outside.The Moto G Stylus goes against the grain for budget phones by featuring three rear cameras — something you typically don't see in low-cost phones outside of... well.. the Moto G Power. But the cameras on the Moto G Stylus are quite different from Motorola's other phone.For starters, the main lens is more powerful, with the Moto G Stylus relying on a 48-megapixel sensor instead of the 16MP camera on the Moto G Power. The main camera on the Moto G Stylus uses quad-pixel binning to combine four megapixels into one to let more light in.I don't know that those extra megapixels make much of a difference in this photo of a houseboat that I shot with both Motorola phones. The houseboat itself looks the same in both shots, but there's some differences in the other details. The sky is a brighter shade of blue in the Moto G Stylus photo, while there's more varied greens in the brush growing along the shore in the foreground. The Moto G Stylus has the better shot, but whether it's better to justify the phone's higher cost is debatable.Other cameras on the back of the Moto G Stylus include a 2MP macro lens and an ultra wide angle lens. The latter is a bit different than the ultra wide angle lens on the Moto G Power, as it can't zoom out for more detailed landscape shots. Instead, the Moto G Stylus' wide angle lens is an action cam used solely for video. Similar to a feature found on the Motorola One Action, this lens lets you film landscape videos even if you hold the phone vertically. That makes it easier to operate your camera one-handed.The macro lens on the Moto G Stylus produces OK images under the right conditions. You've got to get up very close, hope that the lighting is right, and make sure that nothing moves even a little bit that would add any blur to your photo. There was no breeze when I took this photo of a California poppy, which is probably why its edges aren't as fuzzy as a similar shot I took with the Moto G Power's macro lens. And the lens captured some of the detail in the flower's petals, so I'm satisfied with the shot.As for how the Moto G Stylus' cameras compare to the ones on other low-cost phones, I grabbed a Pixel 3a XL and the Stylus to photograph a bowl of pasta. (The XL version of Google's budget phone costs nearly $200 more than the Moto G Stylus, but it has the same camera setup as the $399 Pixel 3a so this will give you some idea of how Motorola's phone compares to the best camera phone if you're on a budget.)The Moto G Stylus holds its own here — while the light streaming into my dining room caused a little over-exposure on the right side of the shot, the pasta itself is well-lit and colorful. The photo is focused enough to where you can make out the flecks of pesto on the rigatoni. The Pixel 3a XL gives everything a blue cast, which makes that cabernet I'm drinking look more like a cup of oil.Back outside, the breeze picked up when I took another photo of those poppies in my backyard, this time without the macro lens. The Moto G Stylus had a hard time compensating for the breeze and the flowers in the lower right foreground are blurred as a consequence. The Pixel 3a XL does a better job keeping everything in focus, though both cameras kept a good balance between shadow and light.The Moto G Stylus supports a Night mode for taking shots when the lights are low, but if this is the result, I wish Motorola wouldn't have bothered. This scene — some stuffed animals sitting around my backyard lit only by red LED lights overhead and a lamp in the background — looks nightmarish in the Moto G Stylus' effort. The red light washes out everything, and it's hard to see where one stuffie ends and another begins. The Pixel 3a XL produces a dramatically better shot — the red lights are still there, but they highlight the scene, and the picture's clear enough to see the details on the cement wall in the background. We're back to comparing the two Motorola phones to assess the Moto G Stylus' portrait effects, and the cheaper Moto G Power actually produces a better shot. The background blur is effective, particularly the way it handles those trees beyond our porch. The Moto G Stylus had a difficult time contending with the shadows and as a result, the colors of my daughter’s blue shirt don't look quite right. The blur here is more pronounced, too, though the Stylus includes tools for adjusting lighting and blur effects.The 16MP selfie cam on the Moto G Stylus does a credible job on self-portraits, though it appears to have been somewhat flustered by the sun peaking through the orange tree behind me. That said, it accurately picked up my skin tone — even if if got overly aggressive in smoothing out my skin — and nailed the different colors of my beard. The Pixel 3a XL's picture is darker, perhaps to overcompensate for that tricky sunlight — though the texture of my skin looks a bit more natural.Using some of the special features of the Moto G Stylus, you start to see the stylus earning more of its keep. Here's the Cinemagraph of me pouring a Manhattan in which I used the stylus to restrict the motion to the cocktail coming out of the shaker and into the glass. I didn't experience the same stray motion that I got on the Moto G Power using just my finger.The stylus also came in handy using the Spot Color feature to call out a specific color in a photo captured by the Moto G Stylus. Here, I taped on lilac petal and that really emphasizes the flowers in a way that makes them stand out from the rest of the shot. Other colors haven't disappeared — you can still see some hint of color from the rug on the floor — but I think this effect is more striking and I'm not sure I could have gotten it without the stylus to tap a very specific area.The Moto G Stylus features a Snapdragon 665 system-on-chip, which is what you'll also find in the Moto G Power and Moto G Fast. It's no surprise that the three Motorola phones fare about the same in benchmark tests. The Moto G Stylus' multicore score of 1,406 on the Geekbench 5 general performance test is slightly higher than the G Power (1,387) and G Fast (1,394). That means the Stylus also outscores the Snapdragon 670-powered Pixel 3a (1,336), but doesn't quite match the Snapdragon 660-powered Nokia 7.2 (1,498).In graphics testing, the Moto G Stylus turned in an average score of 1,756 on 3DMark's Sling Shot Open GL test. That was marginally better than the 1,734 average we saw from the Moto G Power, but not as good as the Nokia 7.2 (2,054) or the Pixel 3a (2,543).At the end of the day, all this means is that the Moto G Stylus performs reasonably well for a lower-priced phone, especially if you're just using your device for everyday tasks like browsing, social media and streaming. Running more processor-intensive apps will likely lead to some hiccups, but when I played PUBG Mobile, I didn't notice too many dropped frames or stutters — in fact, the game even seemed to run better on the Moto G Stylus than it did on the Moto G Power.Another edge the Stylus holds over the cheaper Power is with the built-in storage. The Moto G Stylus comes with 128GB of capacity, double the amount in the Moto G Power. As with that other Motorola phone, the Stylus has a microSD card slot for adding up to 512GB of extra storage.The battery inside the Moto G Stylus may not match the beefy 5,000 mAh power pack inside the Moto G Power, but it's still pretty sizable in its own right. The Moto G Stylus uses a 4,000 mAh battery, which keeps the phone powered up throughout the day.In our battery test, we have phones surf the web continuously over LTE until they run out of power. The Moto G Stylus endured for 12 hours and 13 minutes on our test. That's nearly 4 hours short of the Moto G Power's performance, but it's still well above the average for smartphones and impressive enough to land on our list for best phone battery life. The Moto G Fast, which has the same sized battery as the G Stylus, lasted 4 minutes longer.Motorola promises 10-watt charging for the Moto G Stylus, but that doesn't translate to speedy charge times. After 15 minutes of charging a drained Moto G Stylus, the phone's battery indicator reached 15%; by half-an-hour, it was up to 29%. That's ahead of the 21% reading we got from the Moto G Power after 30 minutes, but not what you'd get from phones that support 18-watt charging.You'll find Android 10 pre-installed on the Moto G Stylus, and as its practice, Motorola does very little to get in the way of that. The few embellishments made to Android are actually useful — Moto Actions let you activate the phone's camera with a twist of the wrist, turn the flashlight on and off with a chopping motion or take a screenshot with three fingers.Apart from the stylus that gives the phone its name, the only other feature of note is the fingerprint reader on the back of the Moto G Stylus, which is easy to locate without inadvertently smudging the phone's camera lenses. The sensor is pretty responsive, too. I didn't get many ""fingerprint not recognized"" alerts the way I did with the Moto G Power.The Moto G Stylus is a solid phone with an interesting feature that makes it easier to jot down notes whenever you want. It delivers good performance for the price and the cameras — while hit and miss — generally produce some decent shots if not the kinds of quality photos you'd get from the Pixel 3a or iPhone SE. If you don't want to spend more than $300 on a phone, the Moto G Stylus is a very good option.And yet, I don't think it's the best cheap phone option, not even from Motorola.In terms of performance, camera and design, there's very little separating the Moto G Stylus from the Moto G Power. And the big difference — battery life — skews heavily toward the Power's favor. It would feel like a closer fight if you could do more with the namesake stylus on this more expensive phone, but without support for more apps, the Moto G Stylus feels too much like a gimmick instead of the bargain that the Moto G Power is."
88,Google Pixel 3 XL,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-pixel-3-xl,review-5826.html","Update: Google has discontinued sales of the the Pixel 3 XL, though you can still find it on sale from some retailers. The mid-range Google Pixel 4a is your best bet for now, and the Pixel 4a 5G and Pixel 5 are launching this fall. If you really care about photo quality, the Pixel 3 XL is the smartphone you want to own. It's one of the best camera phones you can buy, and it's also the best pure Android phone I've ever reviewed.I tested the 6.3-inch Pixel 3 XL, and this flagship ranks right alongside the iPhone XS and other flagships on our list of the best smartphones, thanks to its superb camera quality, amazing AI smarts and smooth performance. Still, the design doesn't wow and the display — while improved — could be brighter. If you're looking for a smaller screen, check out our Pixel 3 review.Although the new Pixel 4 looks like a great phone with its Motion Sense gestures, improved dual cameras, Face Unlock and faster Google Assistant, the Pixel 3 XL is still a very good value, especially since it's going for less these days.Pixel 3 XL Cheat SheetPricing and AvailabilityAt launch, the Pixel 3 XL cost $899, though that has now dropped to as low as $399 on retailers like Amazon for an unlocked version. In the U.S. the Pixel 3 XL started out as a Verizon exclusive among major carriers, but you can buy it unlocked through Google and other retail channels and bring it to your carrier of choice. DesignThe Pixel 3 XL doesn't look radically different than before, but you do get a bigger 6.3-inch display with QHD+ resolution (up from 6 inches on the Pixel 2 XL). The screen looks colorful and immersive, though I'm not a big fan of the swooping notch. It's narrower but deeper than the one on the iPhone XS Max.Around back, Google has delivered a glass back with a matte finish, which is a pretty great feat. Not only does it provide a good grip, but it resists fingerprints. I tested the Just Black Model, but you can also order the Pixel 3 in Clearly White and Not Pink (which is more like a blush hue). Some have complained about the back easily scratching, but I have not found that to be the case so far.The Pixel 3 XL has a fingerprint reader on the back, too, so you can forget about facial recognition or an in-screen fingerprint sensor, which is a bit of a bummer.Google Pixel 3 vs Pixel 3XL Sepcs ComparedDisplay: Colorful but could be brighterThe Pixel 3 XL is one of the better looking OLED displays on a phone this year, and it looks like Google has taken the criticism to heart on the Pixel 2 XL. This panel is colorful and accurate.When watching an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, the 1971 Ferrari in Fly Yellow looked downright luscious, and the picture was so sharp--right down to the fly on the hood--I felt like I was driving around with Jerry Seinfeld.On our lab tests, the Pixel 3 XL's screen turned registered a very good 170.2 percent of the sRGB color gamut. That's in between the iPhone XS Max (123 percent) and Galaxy Note 9 (224 percent). The Pixel 3 XL's panel also turned in a Delta-E score of 0.35 (0 is perfect), which means you should expect accurate hues.However, the brightness could be better, as this panel emits only 362 nits. The iPhone XS hit a whopping 606 nits and the Galaxy Note 9 604 nits in our testing.MORE: OnePlus 7 Pro vs. Pixel 3: Which Phone Wins?AI Cameras Steal the ShowBased on our testing, the Pixel 3 XL is now the best camera phone you can buy. And it's also the smartest.Google is leveraging AI in ways that Apple and Samsung are not. A new Top Shot feature on the 12-MP rear camera automatically snaps a bunch of photos in succession and attempts to choose the right one. This worked well when I snapped a photo of my colleague, Adam. I just swiped up and could easily see which pics Google had picked out.Super Res Zoom is also very impressive. I shot a photo of text on a wall from across the room, and I could easily make out the words, even though the Pixel 3 XL doesn't technically have an optical zoom. The camera is smart enough to reframe the photo and fill in the details.To test low-light performance, we tried the Pixel 3 XL's Night Sight Mode. The phone captures a succession of frames to simulate a long exposure time, and then stitches those frames together to return color to spaces where it's been lost with the help of AI. The results are simply amazing, as you can see in the above photos we took with Night Sight mode on and off in our dark video lab.Night Sight also works wonders with the front cameras. Normal camera mode picked out some detail in the below selfie but the overall quality is dark. Turn on Night Sight, and the result is a bold and bright pic.So how does the Pixel 3 XL camera perform otherwise? Very, very well.Take the above challenging scene, which was taken around 6 p.m. in Herald Square in New York City. The Pixel 3 XL's HDR+ camera does a superb job of exposing the people in the foreground while still delivering detail in the sky. You can also make out the reflections in the glass building on the left.When we compared the Pixel 3 XL against the iPhone XS Max and Galaxy Note 9, Google’s camera performed best overall, but it didn’t win in all cases.In this shot at Bryant Park, the Pixel 3 XL’s image delivered more detail in the tree trunks and there’s better contrast overall. The photo from the iPhone XS Max looks great, but everything just pops a bit more on the Pixel 3 XL, including the leaves.When we pointed both phones toward a building, the Pixel 3 XL’s shot came out overly warm, and the iPhone XS Max did a better job with the light in the foreground. So perhaps the HDR was working better in this case. It’s a more balanced image from the iPhone.The Pixel 3 XL jumped back into the lead with this shot of Monica and Phillip. Everything is sharper, and the shadows come across the best here. With the iPhone XS Max, Philip’s face takes on a yellow cast. The Galaxy Note 9 delivered a crisp shot, but there’s a bit of a green-blue tint that’s off-putting.Last but not least, we used the Pixel 3 XL’s portrait mode to snap a shot of flowers. The Pixel 3 XL’s shot nails a more accurate purplish-pink, while the iPhone XS Max’s pic had a much warmer cast. I actually prefer the look of Apple’s photo in this case, but the Pixel’s is more realistic.Some Pixel 3 owners have encountered a bug that prevents photos from saving, but Google says that an upcoming update will address the issue.Wide-Angle SelfiesGoogle isn't the first to do this, but I like the dual front cameras on the Pixel 3 XL. The company says the wide-angle lens captures 184 percent more of the scene than the iPhone XS, and the results are impressive.The standard lens captured pretty much just me and my colleague Adam, but switching to the wide-angle lens fit in much more of the background. We could have easily squeezed a few more people in.If there's one are where the Pixel 3's camera falls behind the iPhone XS, it's video. In our in-depth video shootout, Apple's phone captured clearer and crisper footage in most situations along with better nighttime footage and audio quality.Call ScreenAs spammers get better and more sophisticated, it can be all too easy to fall for a telemarketer when answering your phone. Google is fighting back with a new call screening feature.Google Assistant will step in and transcribe the call in real time, so you can decide whether it's worth answering. I tested this feature by calling the Pixel 3 from my iPhone XS. With a tap of the button at the top of the display, I selected Screen Call and Google Assistant got to work, introducing herself and then taking down every word as I spoke.This is one of the best implementations of AI that we've seen, and I could see other companies trying to copy this feature. Google says that Google Pixels will get transcription support for call screenings before the end of the year.MORE: Pixel 3 DealsPerformance and BenchmarksFeaturing a Snapdragon 845 processor and 4GB of RAM, the Pixel 3 XL delivers silky smooth performance in everyday use and specific tasks, but its benchmark scores trail some other Android phones.When transcoding a 4K video clip to 1080p in the Adobe Premiere Clip app, the Pixel 3 XL took 2 minutes and 42 seconds. The Galaxy S9+ was a bit faster at 2:32, while the A12 Bionic-powered iPhone XS took only 39 seconds.On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Pixel 3 XL scored a surprisingly low 7,684. The Galaxy Note 9 hit 8,876 and the OnePlus 6 9,088. The iPhone XS Max reached 11,515.We also ran 3DMark Slingshot Extreme to measure graphics performance. The Pixel 3 XL reached 4,396, which is comparable to the iPhone XS Max (4,339) but not as high as the Note 9 (4,639).However, there have been reports of the Pixel 3 XL (as well as the smaller model) occasionally halting background processes abruptly. Initially, many theorized this was an indictment of the phones' 4GB of RAM compared to the 6GB and even 8GB in other flagships, but it turns out the problem may actually have more to do with a glitch in the Pixels' memory management code.To get around that, Google confirmed to 9to5Google that it will distribute a software update ""in the coming weeks"" which will hopefully address the issue. For what its worth, our in-house units have sporadically closed background apps, like Spotify while streaming music — though that's only happened two or three times after nearly a month with the devices.Battery LifeThe Pixel 3 XL packs a 3,430 mAh battery, which is slightly smaller than the 3,520 mAh battery in last year’s Pixel 2 XL. On the Tom’s Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over T-Mobile’s LTE network at 150 nits of screen brightness, the Pixel 3 XL lasted a lackluster 9 hours and 30 minutes. That’s not terrible, but it’s below the 9:48 smartphone average.Strangely, this time is a lot less than the 12:09 the Pixel 2 XL turned in last year on the same LTE network, and the somewhat small difference in battery size doesn’t seem to account for the delta in endurance. We will be running additional tests to confirm our results and will be adding anecdotal battery life data after a few more days of use.  MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeIt’s worth noting that the Pixel 3 lasted a similarly short 8 hours and 27 minutes, which was well below the Pixel 2’s runtime of 11 hours and 7 minutes. The iPhone XS Max (3,174 mAh) lasted 10:38 on our battery test, and the Galaxy Note 9 and its 4,000 mAh battery endured for a considerably longer 11:16.Software and InterfaceIf you haven't used Android 9 Pie yet — and most of us haven't — get ready for a new way to interact with your phone. The Pixel 3 runs the new Google OS, and you use the Home button to go back home and swipe up to show recent apps. It's fairly intuitive, and there's haptic feedback when you press the software-based Home button.You still swipe down from the top of the screen to access settings. I like that the Recent Apps menu puts a Google search box from and center. Other welcome Android Pie features include App Slices, which allows you to get things done without opening the app itself. For instance, you can start booking a Lyft right from the search results menu on the phone.If you're concerned about your phone addiction, there are Digital Wellbeing features offered, including the ability to set timers for app usage. Check out all of the top features of Android Pie.Pixel StandOut of the box, the Pixel 3 supports fast charging via an 18-watt charger, but you can also go the wireless route with the optional Pixel Stand ($79/69).With this accessory, you can enjoy looking at your photos, control smart home gadgets and listen to music via the Pixel 3 XL's dual front-firing speakers. It's kind of like a mini Google Home dock.Bottom LineAmong big-screen phones, the Pixel 3 XL is the one to beat when it comes to camera performance and AI. The iPhone XS has a nicer design and more pure performance through its A12 Bionic chip. And the Note 9 has the Pixel 3 XL beat for productivity with its S Pen. The new Huawei Mate 20 Pro and its three rear cameras also show a lot of promise.But, for those serious about photography, the Pixel 3 XL is an excellent value."
89,Samsung Galaxy S20,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-s20,"The Samsung Galaxy S20 is the Android flagship for people who actually like smaller phones. Thanks to its 6.2-inch display, the S20 is easy to use with one hand, and yet this compact device packs quite a punch. However, the price is not small at $999. OS: Android 10 Screen size: 6.2 inches Screen resolution: QHD+ (563 ppi) Refresh rate: 120Hz Processor: Snapdragon 865 RAM: 12GB Storage: 128GB + microSD Battery: 4,000 mAh Battery life: 9 hours 31 mins Rear cameras: 12MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 64MP telephoto Video: Up to 8K resolution at 24 fps Front cameras: 10MP Size: 5.9 x 3 x 0.31 inches Weight: 5.7 ouncesJust like its bigger and even pricier brothers, the Galaxy S20 gives you a fluid 120Hz display, powerful new camera system with improved zoom and 5G speeds. However, the battery life isn't the best.If you want a bigger 6.7-inch screen, check out our Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus review; it's our favorite of the three new Galaxy S20 phones. And if you want a more powerful 10x lossless zoom and monster 6.9-inch screen, check out our Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra review.Some may prefer the OnePlus 8 Pro, which offers a bigger display than the Galaxy S20 and longer battery life for $899. But as you'll see in our full Galaxy S20 review, we really this phone because of what Samsung packed into such a sleek package. The Samsung Galaxy S20 had a release date of March 6, 2020. The Galaxy S20 cost $999 when it debuted; it comes with 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage standard. You can’t opt for a model with more RAM or storage but you can add up to 1TB of storage via the phone’s microSD card slot.The Galaxy S20 remains available through all major carriers, including a model that supports Verizon's mmWave 5G network. The S20 was a pretty expensive flagship, even at the time it launched, as you can see in this LG Velvet vs. Samsung Galaxy S20 face-off that illustrates how well some midrange phones compared to Samsung's then-flagship. Samsung seems to have gotten the message — the Galaxy S21 that came out this year costs $799, which is $200 less than the S20. (The S20's price has fallen since then.)Anyone interested in snapping up one of Samsung's older flagships for the least expense possible should have a look at the best Galaxy S20 deals out there before pulling the trigger.The Samsung Galaxy S20 doesn’t look radically different from the Galaxy S10, but there are some welcome refinements. The cutout for the front camera is smaller this time around, and it’s placed in the top center of the display instead of on the right side, so it’s less of a distraction. In addition, the display has less of a curve to it, which I appreciate because there’s less of a chance of accidental touches when you’re just shifting the phone in your hands.I feel like it’s not a huge deal at this stage, but it’s definitely notable that the Samsung Galaxy S20 does not include a headphone jack. This is the first Galaxy S flagship phone missing this feature, so you’ll probably want check out our best wireless earbuds and best wireless headphones recommendations. If you want to keep it in the brand family, check out the new Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, which promise 11 hours of battery life.The Samsung Galaxy S20’s color options are not exciting, but at least there's some variety. In the U.S you'll find three Galaxy S20 colors in Cosmic Gray, Cloud Blue and Cloud Pink. I’m partial to the lighter Cloud Blue, just because it looks and feels new. I would have liked to see something more captivating, like the Aura Glow finish that we saw in our Samsung Galaxy Note 10 review. Samsung had fallen behind Apple and Google in photo quality, but the Galaxy S20 looks to beat the competition with bigger sensors, a bigger zoom and new features that make it easier to shoot and share.The Samsung Galaxy S20 has a triple rear camera that starts with a 12-MP wide sensor that’s 1.8 microns. The telephoto lens uses a 64MP sensor that’s 0.8 microns and the 12MP ultra-wide camera uses a 1.4-micron sensor.Why am I rattling off all these numbers? Well, the larger the sensor, the more light it lets in, which should result in brighter and sharper images. By comparison, the Galaxy S10’s wide-angle, telephoto and ultra-wide cameras were 1.4, 1 and 1 microns, respectively. So at least two of the lenses are significantly larger. Indoors under normal lighting conditions, the Galaxy S20 captured a more delicious looking shot of these cookies. You can make out the nooks and crannies — and fudge in the dark chocolate cookies — although Samsung had some help from its AI Scene Optimizer mode that automatically recognizes food.The Samsung Galaxy S20 doesn’t have the Galaxy S20 Ultra’s monster 100x Space Zoom, but it does have a more powerful zoom than the Galaxy S10. The Hybrid Optic Zoom goes up to 3x, which is supposed to be lossless zoom, and the digital zoom goes up to 30x. As you get closer to 30x the camera view gets shaky, but overall this is an improvement on the 2x zoom in the Galaxy S10.In our first zoom test of the Chrysler building from a few blocks away, the Galaxy S20, captured a darker but crisper image than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. There's a bit more noise in the iPhone's shot. I noticed a more dramatic difference when we set the zoom on both phones to 10x, which is digital zoom. You can make out more detail in the building and the windows in the Galaxy S20's photo. With the iPhone 11 Pro Max, you can tell that it's a zoom photo, but with the Samsung phone you're just closer to the subject.The Samsung Galaxy S20's cameras didn't shine in all situations. With this flower close-up I'd give the edge to the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which shows more gradations of color and delivers and overall brighter image. However, the S20's photo provides more detail in the center of the flower.I also give the edge to the iPhone 11 Pro Max over the Samsung Galaxy S20 in this portrait. My face is brighter and pops more in the S20's pic, but the iPhone does a better job rendering the lines in my shirt and the texture in my jacket, details that get lost in the S20's photo.If you look closely, the Galaxy S20 also has trouble with the light behind my head in Live Focus mode, as it seems to dig into the sides of my head.So how about Night mode? The Galaxy S20 did a pretty good job capturing this scene in almost complete darkness. You can make out the gold USS Enterprise in the foreground more clearly than you can in the iPhone 11 Pro Max's photo. However, the overall image is brighter from the iPhone, as it's easier to see the desk, the pedestal for the space ship and objects in the background.My favorite Samsung Galaxy S20 camera feature is Single Take. When you press the shutter button in this mode, the phone takes a series of photos while also recording 10 seconds of video. The phone then gives you a gallery of results, including an AI Best moment, and ultra-wide shot, a Live Focus (portrait mode) pic, as well as a fast forward video that’s great for social and the original video. The Galaxy S20 is a beast on the video front, as it can record 8K video at up to 24 frames per second. You’ll also be able to cast videos to Samsung 8K QLED TVs -- if you can afford one -- and take 33MP photos from 8K videos you might want to share. I'll update this Galaxy S20 review with my impressions once we can access an 8K monitor, but I can say the footage looked very crisp on my MacBook Pro's Retina Display. I could easily make out the gradations in bark in the surrounding trees and even fine details in a man's blue hoodie 50 feet away.The Samsung Galaxy S20’s front camera uses a 10MP sensor that’s 1.22 microns and a f/2.2 aperture. That’s the same resolution and size as the S10’s front camera but that camera had a f/1.9 aperture. A selfie I took with the front camera made my face look a little too smooth, an issue we also found with the Galaxy S20 Plus. At least the Galaxy S20 did a fine job capturing the dots in my shirt and my hair. While a fast processor helps, the refresh rate of the display can make a phone feel smoother in everyday operation, whether you’re scrolling through webpages or playing games. The Samsung Galaxy S20’s 6.2-inch OLED display has 120Hz refresh rate, which is double the 60Hz rate on the Galaxy S10 and higher than the 90Hz screen on the OnePlus 7T.Another plus? The Samsung Galaxy S20 sports a new 240Hz touch sensor that’s supposed to be more responsive. In our testing, the Galaxy S20's 120Hz mode did feel smoother when using Chrome and the Twitter app. When using the phone during our hands-on time, the Galaxy S20 felt pretty fluid, and you can easily toggle between 60Hz and 120Hz in the display settings menu. The bad news is that selecting 120Hz dials the resolution down from quad HD to full HD.The Galaxy S20 has one of the brightest and most colorful displays we've ever tested. The OLED display registered a very high 857 nits of average brightness, which is even brighter than the beaming 752-nit iPhone 11 Pro. The S20's panel also hit an impressive 162.5% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, cimpared to just 83% for the iPhone 11 Pro. The only area where the iPhone edges out this Galaxy is with color accuracy; the S20 turned in a Delta-E score of 0.37 (where 0 is a perfect score), compared to 0.27 to the iPhone 11 Pro. As the first phone with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, the Samsung Galaxy S20 should provide speed aplenty, especially since it’s paired with a robust 12GB of RAM. Samsung is giving you control over how you use this memory, too, as you can assign up to three apps to be stored directly in RAM. The result should be near-instant load times for resource-intensive apps and games.The Samsung Galaxy S20 comes with 128GB of storage and there isn’t a 512GB model as there is with the Galaxy S20 Plus and Galaxy S20 Ultra. Fortunately, you can add up to 1 TB of storage via the microSD card slot.The Galaxy S20 performed very well in various benchmarks, including Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance. The S20 hit 3,147 on the multi-core portion of the test, which is the best score we've every seen on an Android phone. The iPhone 11 Pro's A13 Bionic processor scored an even higher 3,509, so Apple maintains its lead for now. On the GFXBench graphics test (Aztec Ruins Vulkan test off-screen), the Galaxy S20 reached 1,319 frames (21 frames per second), which beats the OnePlus 7T (1,169). The iPhone 11 Pro notched a higher 2,174 frames or 33.8 fps.To test the Galaxy S20's real-world performance, we transcoded a 4K video to 1080p after applying an effect and transition in Adobe Rush. The Galaxy S20 took 1 minute and 15 seconds, which is an improvement on the Galaxy Note 10's time of 1:34. The iPhone 11 Pro needed only 46 seconds.The Samsung Galaxy S20 supports 5G networks, so you should be able to enjoy faster speeds for surfing the web and downloading content on the go. However, at launch, the S20 wasn't available on Verizon’s 5G network. That's because, unlike the larger S20 Plus and Ultra variants, the 6.2-inch S20 normally lacks millimeter-wave connectivity, and Verizon's 5G infrastructure is exclusively millimeter wave, for the time being.Fortunately, Verizon and Samsung are finally addressing that oversight. On June 4, a special edition of the S20 will arrive on Big Red with millimeter-wave support intact, for the same $999 price. It will also run on Verizon's long-range, low-band network, when that goes live later in 2020.In my initial Galaxy S20 speed tests over T-Mobile's network, I saw very good performance in some locations and poor performance in other spots. For example, in central New Jersey the Galaxy S20 hit downloads as high as 183 Mbps, but in New York City the phone notched as low as 5.2 Mbps with a 5G icon showing. Given its 5G connectivity and 120Hz display, the Samsung Galaxy S20 will need a beefy battery to get you through the day. And Samsung has answered the call with a 4,000 mAh battery in this phone. The Galaxy S10 had a 3,400 mAh battery, so this is a fairly big jump.Unfortunately, the Galaxy S20 endured an average of just 9 hours and 31 minutes while set to the 60Hz mode across two sessions of Tom's Guide's custom battery test, where devices repeatedly load web pages over T-Mobile's network until they run out of battery.The phones with the best battery life last 11 to 12 hours. The Galaxy S20 Plus lasted a decent 10 hours and 31 minutes and the the Galaxy S20 Ultra hit an epic 12:03.How does the regular S20 compare to similarly-priced flagships? The iPhone 11 Pro lasted 10 hours and 24 minutes on the same test, and last year's Galaxy S10 managed 10 hours and 19 minutes. The iPhone 11, which costs $300 less than the Galaxy S20, fared even better than both, at 11 hours and 16 minutes.After the S20 completed those tests, we went back and ran two more, now with the device's refresh rate set to 120Hz. This time, the phone only averaged 8 hours and 4 minutes of runtime — nearly an hour and a half less than it managed when operating at 60Hz.Power users or those especially concerned about their device lasting a day or more on a charge will want to have a look at the Galaxy S20 Plus or Galaxy S20 Ultra instead. But with those devices demanding a $200 and $400 premium over the standard S20, respectively, that peace of mind won't come cheap.The Galaxy S20 comes with a 25-watt charging adapter in box that can take the device from empty to 53 percent in a half hour. It also supports 15-watt wireless charging with compatible stands.The Samsung Galaxy S20 comes with Samsung’s new One UI 2 software, which streamlines the interface to make it easier to jump into your favorite apps, change settings and more. This rides on top of Android 10, which includes great new features like Smart Reply, a dark mode and better privacy controls. Samsung is also trying to build better experiences into the Galaxy S20, starting with Google Duo integration. Google’s answer to FaceTime, this video chat app is built right into the phone dialer and contacts apps, and you can video chat with up to 8 people. Plus, you can video chat in full HD for the first time.I conducted a Google Duo video call with my colleague, Adam, and I appreciated that I could start the video call right from the phone app. He said I looked pretty clear coming through his Pixel 4, and his face and voice were both clear on my end after some initial buffering.Other software features include Music Share for sharing out your Bluetooth connection to your car (so someone else can control the playlist for a while) and Spotify integration with Bixby routines, so the Samsung Galaxy S20 will recommend playlists based on your preference and even the moment of the day.The Galaxy S30/Galaxy S21 is on the horizon, which should deliver faster performance and a 120Hz display that's dynamic to save battery life. The latter feature is already available on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. The next Galaxy S phone may also feature a camera under the display to deliver a true full-screen experience. But the Galaxy S21 likely won't launch until February at the earliest. At $999, the Samsung Galaxy S20 isn’t cheap, but it is the most affordable Galaxy S20 phone. It’s also the most compact phone in Samsung’s flagship lineup, making it the best choice for those looking for an Android device that won’t bulge out of their pockets or require two hands to operate. The star of the show is the new camera, which impresses with new features like Single Take and a more powerful zoom.The biggest reason not to get the Galaxy S20 is its battery life. It's runtime is about an hour behind the iPhone 11 Pro, and that delta increases nearly 2.5 hours with the S20's 120Hz display mode enabled. Overall, our top pick among Samsung's new Android phones is the Galaxy S20 Plus, because it offers a larger display and longer endurance. But for that you'll have to step up to $1,199. If you prefer a smaller device, you should be very pleased with the regular Galaxy S20."
90,Galaxy S10,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-s10,review-6279.html","Make way, Galaxy S10. The Samsung Galaxy S20 series is here, which bring advanced cameras, 120Hz displays and improved performance to the company's flagship phone.That brings up an interesting question: should prospective buyers entertain one of the newer models, or snag a Galaxy S10 on the cheap, while many retailers have heavily discounted their stock?That all depends on how badly you want the S20's upgrades. The S20 models packs 5G connectivity and Snapdragon 865 power; a triple-lens rear camera with a 48-megapixel, 3x optical zoom lens; a 120Hz display; and a larger, 4,000-mAh battery, among other upgrades. es.You could save nearly a quarter of what the S20 costs and still get one of last year's finest phones in the Galaxy S10, with its dazzling OLED display and great (if not class-leading) cameras that come alive when shooting low light. Even with the S20 looming large, the S10 is still every bit the jack-of-all-trades premium Android handset it was when it launched — not to mention one of the best smartphones money can buy.If you're on the fence, be sure to check our Galaxy S20 versus Galaxy S10 comparison to see all the differences. And see how Samsung's flagship stacks up against Apple's in our Galaxy S10 vs iPhone 11 Pro face-off. You can buy a Galaxy S10 from all major retailers. The big four U.S. carriers — AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile — carry the S10, as do U.S. Cellular and Xfinity Mobile. You can also order an unlocked Galaxy S10 online.Following the Galaxy S20's launch, Samsung began offering the 128GB Galaxy S10 for $749 and the 512GB model for $899. Those models cost $899 and $1,149, respectively, before the S20 entered the picture. Check out our roundup of best Galaxy S10 deals for more opportunities to save.Almost every other smartphone maker has eliminated bezels by adding a notch that swoops down from the top of the device to disguise the front-facing camera. Samsung avoided that trend altogether with all three Galaxy S10 models, instead developing the unique Infinity-O display, which embeds the front-facing camera lens directly in the screen.The midsized S10 sports a hole-punch-size cutout for its single selfie lens, which is far less distracting than the S10 Plus' oval-shaped cutout.I read lengthy New York Times articles, raced my trusty Mitsubishi Lancer in Asphalt 9 and took multiple selfies with the S10, and the hole punch never took away from the experience. When snapping photos of myself, I realized that the obvious cutout ensured I always looked directly at the lens. For those of you who never seem to nail eye contact with the camera lens, the S10's cutout is a great feature, making this task ridiculously easy.You can also hide the hole punch with Samsung's cleverly designed wallpapers. That won't help when you're streaming videos or browsing the web, but the disguise looks pretty damn good when you show it off to friends. The slightly curved glass practically cascades from the phone's frame. That curved glass also makes it a little too easy to accidentally press something simply because you were holding the device; this was also a problem in past generations of Galaxy phones. If you want to hide the cutout altogether, that’s an option, but that effect is so ugly that you may as well buy another Android device with a notch and call it a day.The S10 broke DisplayMate's records for display brightness, color accuracy and image contrast, and the list goes on, so the S10 earned an A+ for a virtually perfect display. We found the same in our testing. The S10's AMOLED display covers 208.2 percent of the sRGB color gamut and notched a 0.38 Delta-E rating for color accuracy (numbers closer to 0 are better). The S10 hit a peak brightness of 611 nits when we shone a flashlight on its sensor, making the phone's panel almost as bright as that on the S10 Plus (625 nits). The Pixel 3 is ultra dim by comparison, hitting just 362 nits.Aside from the hole-punch display, the Galaxy S10 is the same as every other smartphone on the market. That's not a bad thing, but if you're waiting for innovative smartphone design before spending close to $1,000 (or far more) for a new device, you'll have to hold out for the foldable phones arriving this year.The 6.1-inch S10 has the exact same dimensions as Apple's 6.1-inch, $749 iPhone 11 but is more than a full ounce lighter. The S10 isn't a one-handed device for those of us with petite paws; the 5.8-inch S10e is both smaller and cheaper, so go for that device if size is the deciding factor for you in phone selection.The S10 comes in the same colors as the larger $999 Galaxy S10 Plus, which offers a few simple options (like white and black) and some bolder ones (blue, Flamingo Pink). I tested the Prism Black model, which is a terribly boring glassy black slab. I suggest going with Prism White, or one of the more interesting hues, which will help you stand out. The black model collects so many fingerprints that you'll look like a really uncool forensics investigator.Like all Galaxy S models, the S10 is rated IP68 water-resistant, meaning it can survive in up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water for a half-hour. That's respectable in the flagship phone realm, and thus earns the Galaxy S10 a spot on our list of the best waterproof phones.The S10 and S10 Plus have one key difference, aside from the larger phone's bigger display: The Plus sports an additional 8-megapixel, depth-sensing, front-facing camera for better selfies. Both devices have a selfie-portrait effect, which enables other effects, including wind-swept and black-and-white backgrounds.But the S10 achieves those effects using software instead of an additional depth-sensing lens, and it shows when comparing the two side by side.As you can see in the black-and-white Live Focus image above, the S10's camera software gets a little messy around my curls. Meanwhile, the S10 Plus seamlessly softens the background around them, creating a more natural effect.Otherwise, the S10 and S10 Plus have the same rear triple-lens camera array, with telephoto, standard and wide-angle shooters for capturing a variety of viewpoints. I compared the S10 with a Pixel 3 by capturing a Brooklyn storefront. Both images capture the detail in the brick and the gleam of the coffee shop's sign, but the S10 is more color-accurate; the neon ""No Sleep Till"" sign glowed more yellow than blue-white in real life.I also compared the S10's telephoto lens and optical zoom with the iPhone XS cameras by playing tourist with a photo of the Statue of Liberty as seen from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. It's an almost impossible shot, because Lady Liberty is extremely far away and the midday sun is not helpful. The iPhone's optical zoom fared better, as the S10's image is darker, with more artifacts in the photo.The S10's cameras are good, though if you want more dramatic photos, the Pixel 3  and newer Pixel 4 remain better options, while the latest iPhones capture more-natural shots.Samsung can't compete with Apple on biometric authentication, and we're not sure the Galaxy maker is even trying. This is one area where Samsung needs to work harder to ensure that unlocking your phone and authenticating payments are locked down with the most secure biometric scans that money can buy.In our testing, the S10's facial recognition is easily fooled by a photograph of a person's face. That's just plain embarrassing. The photo trick doesn't work if you turn off Fast Facial Recognition in the S10's settings, but the facial-authentication method is still less secure than it should be. That's because Samsung doesn't use hardware to create a 3D map of your face the way Apple does with its Face ID.The S10's in-display reader is more secure, due to an ultrasonic sensor that maps the 3D curves of your fingerprint. You have to press a little longer on the sensor than you would think, but the phone unlocks quickly enough, and I appreciate that it's not a two-step process, like on the iPhone XS. (On that phone, you have to wait for the camera to scan your face and then swipe up.)There have been some complaints about the Galaxy S10's ultrasonic fingerprint sensor not working properly when a screen protector is applied to the phone. In fact, one woman claims that anyone could unlock her Galaxy S10 after she purchased a screen protector off of eBay. Fortunately, Samsung issued an update designed to fix this problem shortly after release.The Galaxy S10 Plus and smaller S10 have the same exact specs, and it shows in their performance power. With Qualcomm's 7-nanometer Snapdragon 855 processor and 8GB of RAM, the S10 easily matches the larger S10 Plus' speed.The two devices scored evenly on Geekbench 4, a synthetic test of overall system performance. The S10 notched a multicore score of 10,813, sneaking just ahead of the larger phone's performance (10,732). Both phones lag behind the iPhone XS' A12 Bionic processor, which blows away the competition with a 11,420 score.But both S10s handily crush their Android rivals, including the Pixel 3 (7,316) and OnePlus 6T (8,972).  MORE: Best phones: Here are the 10 best availableAnd the S10, like the S10 Plus, pulled ahead of both the iPhone and competing Android flagships in the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme graphics-performance benchmark. The S10 notched a score of 5,606 on the OpenGL ES 3.1 test, just behind the larger S10's score (5,648) and easily ahead of the results from the OnePlus 6T (5,183), Pixel 3 (4,396) and iPhone XS (4,339).I unlocked one premium race car after another in my favorite graphics-intensive game, Asphalt 9, easily killing 45 minutes burning rubber around the globe. The S10 never lagged or felt warm to the touch.The Galaxy S10's 3,400-mAh battery isn't as large as the massive, 4,100-mAh pack inside the S10 Plus. And as expected, the smaller device doesn't last as long on a charge, though you can still go a long time without topping off your battery.The S10 eked out 10 hours and 19 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which consists of continuous web surfing over 4G LTE. The S10 Plus landed near the top of our list of longest-lasting smartphones, reaching 12 hours and 35 seconds on that test.MORE: Smartphones with the longest battery lifeThe Galaxy S9 Plus, released in 2018, also lasts longer on a charge than the S10, but that older phone has a slightly larger, 3,500-mAh battery. The S10e and its smaller, 3,100-mAh unit died after 9 hours and 42 minutes. The S10 outlasted both the iPhone XS (9:41) and the Pixel 3 XL (9:30). In the iPhone 11 Pro vs. Samsung's S10 face-off, the Pro lasted four minutes longer (10:23) than the S10. All three Galaxy S10 models have a new Wireless PowerShare feature that we wish every smartphone on the market offered. The tool, which you toggle on in the shortcuts menu by swiping down, lets you charge up any Qi-compatible device.I used this to charge up Samsung's Galaxy Watch Active, and the process works quickly and seamlessly.The OneUI software on the Galaxy S10 is streamlined as promised and fairly to easy to use. The settings menu, for example, presents a lot fewer options than previous Galaxy phones.By default, there’s a Recent Apps, Home Button and Back button along the bottom of the display. But you can switch to full-screen gestures. You'll swipe up from the bottom left to see recent apps, up from the bottom to go home and up from the right to go back.The Galaxy S10 also now offers some of the more compelling software features of the Galaxy Note 10. These include Live Focus video for applying bokeh effects to your footage and Samsung DeX for PC, which allows you to see notifications and send and receive messages on your laptop without having to fire up your phone.Even more than a year since its release, the Galaxy S10 offers superfast performance and a beautiful display, with a less distracting camera cutout than on the larger, pricier S10 Plus. I also love that the S10 offers my favorite feature, Wireless PowerShare. That means you don't have to splurge on the priciest Galaxy to reverse-charge all of your devices.Apple and Google's latest flagships sport better cameras, depending on whether you prefer more dramatic or more natural shots. And if you want longer battery life, the S10 Plus is a better bet, provided you can handle a larger, 6.4-inch screen. We do prefer the S10 to the value-priced OnePlus 6T, based on our face-off.Sure, the Galaxy S20's redesigned triple-camera stack and 5G connectivity could put the Galaxy S10's photography and data speeds to shame. But at the end of the day, if all you're looking for is a well-rounded, well-crafted Android flagship that can do it all — including work with a pair of good old-fashioned wired headphones — for a price you can sleep easy at night spending, the Galaxy S10 remains an unbeatable proposition."
91,Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-note-10-plus,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus has such an immersive 6.8-inch display that you'll sometimes forget you're not watching TV. And the back of the Galaxy Note 10 Plus is just as captivating as the front, especially if you opt for the Aura Glow color.Once you look past the eye candy, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus (starting at $1,099/£999) is easily one of the best Android phones. It delivers strong performance, a host of new S Pen tricks — including Air gestures — and above-average battery life. I also like the fast charging and pro-level video effects. However, the cameras could be better.As I discovered during my Galaxy Note 10 Plus review, it's a great phone for those who prefer larger displays. The newer Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is a better bet for power users, because it offers a smoother 120Hz display, faster processor, a bunch of S Pen upgrades and a more powerful 50x zoom camera. But the Note 10 Plus is worth considering if you want something more affordable.The Galaxy Note 10 Plus costs $1,099 for the 256GB version (£999 / AU$1,699). You can also opt for a model with 512GB of storage for $1,199. But you should definitely check out our roundup of the best Galaxy Note 10 deals to get the lowest price. We routinely see Galaxy Note 10 sales that knock the price down to $949 or lower with activation.All of the major U.S. wireless carriers are selling the Galaxy Note 10 Plus, including AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. Samsung also offers trade-in deals for those who order their device through Samsung.com.I have to give credit to Samsung. It has managed to cram a 6.8-inch display into a design that's both thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Note 9, which had a 6.4-inch display. This is partly because the Galaxy Note 10 has slimmer bezels, thanks to its Infinity-O display with a cutout for the front camera in the top center portion of the screen.Samsung also removed the headphone jack, which at this point feels more inevitable than controversial. It also allows the Galaxy Note 10 Plus to pack a bigger battery. The good news is that Samsung bundles AKG headphones in the box that use USB-C.Make no mistake, the Note 10 Plus looks and feels like a phablet, especially compared with the regular Note 10 and its 6.3-inch screen. This is definitely a two-handed device, but it's a sleek one.If you like your phone to be flashy, I would pick up the Aura Glow version of the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. The iridescent silver design changes colors based on how the light hits the back of the phone. The only issue is that the Aura Glow model picks up fingerprints quickly; I found myself wiping the back of the phone on my shirts and pants to keep the smudges at bay.A close second for me is the Aura Blue in terms of fashion, but you can also get more traditional Aura Black and Aura White. I do have one other nitpick. While I'm glad Samsung ditched the dedicated Bixby button found on previous models, I wish the volume controls and power button were on the right side instead of the left. After all, most people are right-handed.Short of a foldable phone, you won't find a larger screen on an Android phone than the 6.8-inch AMOLED panel on the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. And it is a sight to behold, with the same rich colors and wide viewing angles we've come to expect from Samsung.The screen has the same Quad HD+ resolution as before, but it's certified for HDR10+, compared withHDR10 for the Note 9. When watching the trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I could make out fine wisps of hair on Rey's head, and Kylo Ren's firey red lightsaber crackled and popped off the screen as he drove it into his enemies.The center cutout or punch hole at the top center of the Galaxy Note 10's screen isn't as offensive as the cutout on the Galaxy S10 Plus. That's because this has a single front camera, compared with two on the S10 Plus that are located on the right side.On our lab tests, the Note 10 Plus' screen turned in some of the best performance numbers we've seen. It hit 686 nits of brightness, which beats the OnePlus 7 Pro (513 nits), iPhone XS Max (606 nits) and Galaxy S10 Plus (625 nits). The OLED panel on the Note 10 Plus hit 212% of the color gamut in Vivid Mode and 124.6% in Natural mode, compared to 123% to the iPhone XS Max and 180% for the OnePlus 7 Pro. The Galaxy S10 Plus wasn't as colorful in Vivid mode (200%) and a slightly higher 136.5% in Natural mode.The one letdown with this screen is that it doesn't offer a refresh rate of 90Hz as some had rumored, which offers smoother performance in phones like the OnePlus 7 Pro. This would have been a welcome upgrade for folks stepping up from the Note 10 to the Note 10 Plus.The Galaxy Note 10 has an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, similar to the Galaxy S10. The sensor works pretty well overall, but users discovered that both the sensors on the S10 and Note 10 could be fooled using a silicon screen protector. A subsequent software update from Samsung reportedly fixes this issue.The S Pen has learned some new tricks with the Galaxy Note 10, but I'm not yet sold on how useful they are. The handwriting-to-text feature is designed to let you convert your scribbles and import them, such as into Microsoft Word docs. The functionality generally worked during my brief hands-on time, but the phone sometimes missed a letter. More important, it just didn't feel instant.I like that you can just double tap on words in the Notes app  and then tap the convert button that appears. However, I didn't see a way to select all handwritten notes within a note at once, and if you have a longer note the process of double tapping a selection and then dragging the box to enlarge it seems like too much work.If you like the idea of using the S Pen as a pseudo-magic wand, there's Air Actions. This S Pen feature lets you do things like change modes in the camera app by waving the stylus from side to side while pressing the button, or zooming in on a subject by drawing a small circle in the air. I tried the gestures and not all of them worked consistently well. Changing camera modes was easy, as was going from the front to back camera (you just go up and down with the S Pen). However, zooming in and out proved tricky; sometimes I zoomed in and out without a problem, but sometimes I accidentally took a bunch of photos while trying to zoom out.With AR Doodle, Galaxy Note 10 users can draw right on top of people in the camera view, and whatever you draw will follow that person as they move around the frame. It could be fun at parties.I didn't find much use for AR Doodle at first because I'm simply not a very good drawer, but once I put it in the hand of staff writer Kate Kozuch, I could see the potential. She drew an eye patch on fellow writer Adam Ismail, and then added a little parrot on his shoulder. She said she really likes the feature, even though I noticed that the eye patch came away from Adam's face as he turned.With its four camera sensors, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus is definitely an upgrade over the Galaxy Note 9's two cameras. The back of the Note 10 Plus houses a wide-angle camera and telephoto lens like its predecessor, but adds an ultrawide shooter to fit in more of the frame and a depth sensor to achieve more convincing bokeh effects when shooting portraits.Check out the photo gallery below and side-by-side comparisons versus top cameras phones below that to see how the Note 10 Plus' cameras stack up.The Note 10 Plus offers Live Focus effects when shooting portraits, similar to the Galaxy S10 Plus. I like the Big Circle and Color Point effects especially, though the bokeh effect looked a bit messy. Big Circle looks good at first glance but blurred out Adam Ismail's hair. Color Point puts the subject in color and the background in black and white, which I could see myself using more often.In our side-by-side shots with the Galaxy Note 10 Plus and Google Pixel 3 and Huawei P30 Pro, the Note 10 Plus held its own but didn't surpass the competition. However, the Note 10 Plus' Night mode did impress.As you can see from this photo taken in near darkness, the Night mode on the Galaxy Note 10 Plus performs quite well. With Night mode turned on, the gloves on the right become a lot more visible, as does the multi-tool in the foreground and the cube on the left.I then compared the Galaxy Note 10 Plus in Night mode against the Pixel 3 XL's camera with Night Sight turned on. Google's phone has an edge, as it delivered a brighter shot with slightly more vivid colors. In this low-light test on a city street, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus snapped a remarkably bright photo with Night mode engaged; you can make out the buildings and cars clearly. However, some areas of the shot look a little more blown out than in the Pixel 3 XL's shot, especially the lights on the left side. And the tan in the Cadillac's roof on the right looks a little more crisp on the Pixel 3 XL.In this shot of a bar in Grand Central station, the Galaxy Note 10 produces a brighter and warmer-looking photo that I’d rather share, but the Pixel 3’s image features more realistic colors. This round is really no contest. The Galaxy Note 10 Plus really struggles against the Pixel 3 in capturing a portrait of me inside the New York Public Library. The light above me nearly blows out the scene. My teenage daughter called the photo ""garbage."" Yikes. The Pixel 3's bokeh effect is almost too aggressive but overall it's the superior shot. Once again the Galaxy Note 10 Plus renders a warm-looking photo in this shot of flowers, and the exposure looks pleasant. Still, I’d give the nod to the Pixel 3 in this round, as the details in the petals and veins are much more distinct. Turning our attention to cupcakes, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus delivers more details in the shot from front to back. Check out the chocolate one in the background. However, the Huawei P30 Pro gets the color of the pink frosting right on the cupcake in the foreground, and the white-and-yellow flower looks better on the Huawei pic.The Note 10 Plus' shot just looks less realistic.This photo taken outside the New York Public Library provides an interesting contrast between the Galaxy Note 10 Plus and Huawei P30 Pro. I like both shots for different reasons.The Note’s pic is more vibrant, especially the green in the tree off to the right; it’s almost too bright overall, though, as the Huawei does a better job retaining the shadows. Check out the detail in the columns and in the lion statue.Since we tested the Note 10 Plus' cameras, Samsung released its Galaxy S20 lineup, which features much more substantive camera improvements, especially on the Galaxy S20 Ultra. However, some of those capabilities are coming to the Note 10 Plus by way of a software update. Note 10 Plus owners will be able to take advantage of Single Take, in which multiple shots are captured simultaneously from the phone's different cameras, as well as improvements to Hyperlapse that will allow you to capture time-lapse footage in low-light.Samsung says the Note 10 Plus now offers pro-grade video. For example, the phone offers Live Focus video effects, so you can blur out the background or change the background to black and white while the subject is in color. This worked well in my testing; my colleague Rami jumped off some stairs with the Live Focus on and the background of plants and passersby was indeed blurred.I also tried Live Focus on two other colleagues, Adam and Kate, as they walked down a pathway in Bryant Park. The Note 10 Plus did a remarkable job blurring out plants and other people but at times Kate looked a little blurry, too. Still, the whole clip looks pretty compelling and kind of reminds me of a soap opera.I was also impressed with the improved Super Steady mode in the camera. Once you press the little wavy hand icon towards the top of the screen and start recording, the camera can minimize any camera shake. I tested this out by jogging up stairs with the Galaxy Note 10 Plus in one hand and the iPhone XS Max in the other hand.As you can see from the results, the Note 10 Plus' footage looks much smoother, while the iPhone XS Max's video looks a bit shaky.There's also a Zoom-In Mic feature that amplifies the audio in the frame. This feature didn't impress me that much. That's because as I zoomed in on two subject, their words got louder but so did the ambient noise of cars passing by.Samsung backs this all up with an improved video-editing app that's optimized for the S Pen. I appreciated how easy it was to drag the slider tool and trim clips with the pen, and you can choose from multiple effects to spruce up your footage.As for the front 10-MP camera, I didn't love the selfie the Note 10 Plus took of me outside on an overcast day. My skin looks a little washed out, as does the rest of the photo. I do like there's a Night mode for the front camera now, which can come in handy at restaurants, bars, concerts and more.With its Snapdragon 855 processor, the Galaxy Note 10 should offer comparable performance to the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus, but the addition of UFS 3.0 storage should provide a speed boost. Still, we were hoping that Samsung would have used the newer Snapdragon 855+ chip to achieve higher clock speeds.The Note 10 Plus should have plenty of memory for multitasking, as it offers 12GB of RAM standard, compared with 8GB for the regular Note 10. And you get 256GB of storage standard with the option of upgrading to a 512GB model. Unlike the Note 10, the Note 10 Plus includes a microSD card slot for expansion.In everyday use, the Note 10 Plus is a swift performer. In fact, it loaded apps like Chrome, Twitter and Facebook slightly faster than the iPhone XS Max. This phablet also ably handled long play sessions in PUBG Mobile. It delivered console-like detail without any stuttering even at the highest setting, and the phone remained relatively cool.On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus turned in a very good score of 11,210, which is comparable to the OnePlus 7 Pro (11,227) but lower than the iPhone XS Max (11,515). The Note 10 Plus beats the Galaxy S10 Plus (10,732), which doesn't benefit from UFS 3.0 storage.The Galaxy Note 10 Plus turned in a fantastic score on the 3DMark Sling Shot Extreme (OpenGL ES 3.1) graphics test. It notched 5,781, which surpasses the Galaxy S10 Plus (5,648) and soundly beats the iPhone XS Max (4,339).Samsung's phone fell behind the iPhone once more on our video editing test, for which we transcode a 4K video to 1080p in the Adobe Rush app. After applying a filter and transition effect and hitting go, the Note 10 Plus took 1 minute and 34 seconds to complete the task. That's good, and a few seconds better than the OnePlus 7 Pro, but the iPhone XS took only 41 seconds.When it comes to gaming performance, the Note 10 Plus has an AI-based Game Booster mode for optimizing performance and power consumption based on the game. And you'll even be able to stream games from your PC to this phone using Samsung's Play GalaxyLink, a P2P streaming service that the company says will be available at launch.The Galaxy Note 9's battery was the biggest yet in a Galaxy phone at 4,000 mAh, but the Note 10 Plus ups the ante with a 4,300 mAh battery, which is even bigger than the 4,100 mAh pack in the Galaxy S10 Plus.On the Tom's Guide Battery Life Test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE (on T-Mobile), the Galaxy Note 10 Plus lasted 11 hours and 46 minutes. That number proved an outlier, as subsequent tests produced results ranging from 10 hours, 15 minutes to more than 10.5 hours. In the end, across four tests, the Note 10 lasted 10 hours, 47 minutes across four tests, beating the average for a smartphone by more than half-an-hour.By comparison, the Galaxy Note 9 had a slightly longer runtime (11 hours and 16 minutes) but the S10 Plus lasted an epic 12:35. The OnePlus 7 Pro lasted just 9:31 on our test, while the iPhone XS Max has a runtime of 10:38. The regular Galaxy Note 10 lasted an average of 9 hours and 25 minutes, so those who want more endurance should opt for the Note 10 Plus.Samsung does sell another phone with a screen size that's nearly identical in the Galaxy S10 5G. That handset packs a 6.7-inch screen and an even bigger 4,500 mAh battery. On our battery test, the S10 5G lasted a good-but-not-great 10:56. However, this was on Verizon's 4G LTE network, which we've found drains phones faster than T-Mobile's network for some reason.The Note 10 Plus comes with a 25-watt charger, but there's an even faster 45-watt charger that Samsung sells separately for $50 (it's currently not available in the UK). You may not need the latter, though. The Galaxy Note 10 Plus get to 33% battery capacity in just 15 minutes and 65% in 30 minutes. The OnePlus 7 Pro got to 60% in 30 minutes with its 4,000 mAh battery, while the Huawei P30 Pro reached 70% in the same amount of time on a 4,200 mAh battery.As you'd expect from a Samsung phone, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus supports wireless charging, but this time around it's 15 watts, while the Galaxy S10 supported up to 10 watts. However, the results are disappointing based on our testing. It took 30 minutes of the Galaxy Note 10 to reach just 21 percent using Samsung's $79 wireless charger stand.You can also use reverse wireless charging on the Note 10 Plus, which means you can charge the Galaxy Buds or other phones using the back of Samsung's handset.No dock required, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus can easily sync with your PC using a single USB cable. Once connected, you'll be able to drag-and-drop files back and forth and use your laptop's mouse and keyboard to navigate the phone. And with the Link to Windows app, you'll be able to receive notifications and send and receive messages on the desktop.I tested out the DeX app out on a MacBook Pro, and I had uneven results. The DeX app found the phone pretty quickly, popping up a desktop atop macOS. And I could easily access photos, make calls and even transfer files from the phone to my Mac.However, I got an error message when I tried to drag and drop files from the computer to the phone. It seems like Samsung still needs to work out some kinks with DeX, at least with the Mac.One feature that's exclusive to the Galaxy Note 10 Plus and not available for the Note 10 is Quick Measure, which instantly can give you the dimensions of pretty much any object.It's like an augmented reality tape measure that one-ups the Measure app in iOS, because you get the length, width and depth with a single scan. With the iPhone you have to draw virtual lines on the object before you get a measurement.For example, I pointed the Note 10 Plus at a can and it returned a height of 4.5 inches, a depth of 2.5 inches and a width of 2.5 inches. I verified those numbers using a tape measure and the Note 10 Plus was accurate.The Galaxy Note 10 Plus does something unique, thanks to its depth sensor on the back. You can scan objects in 3D with relative ease. You just walk around the object and the phone creates a 3D model.Samsung demonstrated this feature during its launch event with a stuffed bear, as you can see in the below tweet.After the phone is done creating the 3D model, you can embed it into videos and the object can become animated and even mimic dance moves that are on screen. It's a fun demo but I'm not sure how people will use this yet.The Galaxy Note 10 Plus is a fantastic big-screen phone. Although the price is quite steep at $1,099/£999, you get one of the best and most immersive displays ever in a phone along with strong performance and long battery life. And while Samsung has not caught up to Google and Apple in photography, the Note 10 Plus is still a very capable camera phone with a compelling Night mode and intriguing video effects.If you really want an S Pen with your phone but don't want to spend as much, the smaller 6.3-inch Galaxy Note 10 should satisfy. It has the same processor and mostly the same cameras (minus the depth sensor on the back) in a more compact design than the Note 10 Plus. But if you want a really big screen, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus is worth the splurge, as it also offers more RAM and microSD expansion, along with longer battery life.Those who want the latest and greatest are better off with the newer Samsung Galaxy Note 20 and Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which offer better cameras, new S Pen features and other upgrades like wireless DeX mode. Overall, though, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus is an ultra-premium, big-screen phone that you'll be psyched to use."
92,Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-s20-plus,"The 6.7-inch Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus is an Android phone that has almost everything in the top-line 6.9-inch Galaxy S20 Ultra model, Buyers get a quartet of lenses on the Galaxy S20 Plus, headlined by a 64-MP telephoto with 3x lossless zoom. While the regular Galaxy S20 is now available on all carriers, the S20 Plus boasted full support for 5G out of the gate — every 5G network, no matter which carrier you're on — a Snapdragon 865 processor with a whopping 12GB of RAM and a 120-Hz, quad-HD AMOLED display.That’s a lot of features in the Galaxy S20 Plus, which also sports a price that matches that ambitious spec sheet. And while the S20 Plus does a better job justifying its sky-high cost than either the $1,399 Galaxy S20 Ultra or the $1,299 Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, whether it outpaces other less expensive Android phones comes down to how strongly you feel about its improved cameras, long-lasting battery and impressive 120Hz OLED screen. Since the Galaxy S20 Plus' release this spring, the OnePlus 8 Pro has come along, and that phone edged Samsung's handset in our OnePlus 8 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy S20 face-off, and Samsung has released new Galaxy Note 20 models as well. Even if it can no longer lay claim to the title of best Android phone following the OnePlus 8 Pro's arrival, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus remains one of the best phones you can buy.The Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus will set you back $1,199. That gets you 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, though you'll be able to upgrade to 512GB for an extra $150.Regardless, even if you don't opt for the 512GB version, you can always insert a microSD card into the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus or S20 Ultra to give your phone up to another terabyte of storage.It’s hard to look past that $1,199 price, which is $200 more than the Galaxy S10 Plus cost when that phone debuted in 2019. And now that Samsung has cut the price of the S10 Plus by $150, the gap in price is even bigger. (You can see what the differences are between Samsung’s old and new phones in our look at the Galaxy S20 vs. the Galaxy S10.)The Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus is available through each of the big four U.S. networks — AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. US Cellular, Xfinity Mobile and Visible offer the Galaxy S20 Plus as well, and you can find it at Samsung, Amazon and Best Buy. As of the summer, discount carriers including Visible have started offering  the phone.You should shop around for the best Galaxy S20 deals to see if you can save on this expensive phone. At Samsung, the phone maker is offering up to $500 off in trade-in value when you buy one of its Galaxy S20 models, including the Plus.Starting Price: $1,199 Display: 6.7-inch quad-HD AMOLED; 120-Hz refresh rate CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 RAM: 12GB Storage: 128GB, 512GB microSD: Yes, up to 1TB Rear camera: Quad-lens: 12MP primary (ƒ/1.8); 64MP telephoto with 3x lossless zoom (ƒ/2.0); 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2); VGA time of flight Front camera: 10MP (ƒ;/2.2) Battery size: 4,500 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 10:31 (60Hz); 8:55 (120Hz) Size: 6.37 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches Weight: 6.56 ouncesSamsung's gone for the iterative approach with the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus' design, relocating the Galaxy S10's front-facing camera to the middle, just like what you'll find on the Galaxy Note 10, while stacking the rear optics vertically in an elongated, rectangular housing.The edges of the phone's Infinity display aren't as steeply curved as the edges were on the last three Galaxy S handsets. However, the S20 Plus' rounded frame and camera-in-screen aesthetic still make it instantly recognizable as a Samsung product.The Galaxy S20 Plus comes in three colors: Cloud Blue, Cosmic Gray and Cosmic Black. Personally, this feels like a step back; the S10 line was available in a wide range of unique and bold colors — from the iridescent Prism White to stunning Flamingo Pink — and the hues that Samsung's gone for here feel drab and uninspired by comparison. Perhaps they'll look better in natural light.The Cosmic Black model we’ve been testing looks high end, but doesn’t really stand out. Its glass back panel also smudges with fingerprints quite easily, so either carry a cloth or protect your phone with a Galaxy S20 Plus case.At 6.37 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches and 6.56 ounces, you are not going to mistake the Galaxy S20 Plus for a compact handset — it still compares favorably to other big screen phones. The iPhone 11 Pro Max (6.2 x 3.1 x 0.32 inches, 7.97 ounces) is not as tall as the S20 Plus, but it’s noticeably wider and heavier. Credit the S20 Plus’ 20:9 aspect ratio for keeping things narrow to the point where even I — an outspoken fan of smaller phones — found the S20 Plus quite pleasant to use. Forget using this new Samsung phone with just one hand, though. Like other Galaxy S20 models, the S20 Plus is rated IP68 water resistant, meaning it can withstand being submerged in as much as 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. That's less impressive than the 13 feet (4 meters) of water resistance the iPhone 11 Pro gives you, though it's still enough to earn the S20 Plus a spot on our list of the best waterproof phones.You won't get Samsung's crown jewel 108MP main camera or 100x digital Space Zoom in the Galaxy S20 Plus. Those features are reserved for the Galaxy S20 Ultra. So what do you get in the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus? Most of the time, you rely on a 12MP primary lens with an f/1.8 aperture; a 64MP telephoto with f/2.0 aperture capable of 3x optical zoom; a 12MP ultrawide lens with f/2.2 aperture; and a VGA time-of-flight depth sensor, which will assist with live photos and other effects.One point to specify about that optical zoom lens: It isn't actually a zoom lens in a traditional sense. The focal length is similar to that of the main camera, and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus merely crops into the center of the frame to achieve the 3x effect. This was presumably done to avoid a permanently zoomed-in perspective when recording video, because the same 64MP sensor is also task with 8K video capture.You can see how that telephoto lens comes into play when we compare the Galaxy S20 Plus’ camera setup with that of the iPhone 11 Pro Max — one of the best camera phones we’ve tested in the past year. Both phones take a very pleasant landscape shot of the Oakland skyline from across the San Leandro Channel, with the bluish cast the S20 Plus lends its shot making for a more inviting bay and brighter sky.The Galaxy S20 Plus begins to distinguish itself when we start zooming in with both phones. The iPhone 11 Pro Max supports a 2X zoom, and its shot is certainly all right, though the boats in the marina continue to dominate the foreground. Tapping the zoom on the S20’s camera, the buildings in the background come in to sharper view, thanks to the 3X zoom on the phone. The S20 Plus is going to be the phone you want to grab when you have to shoot things from a distance and want to capture more detail.If we keep zooming in, we begin to put the phones’ software to the test, and it’s one that the Galaxy S20 Plus passes. Using Oakland’s Tribune Tower as a focal point, both photos get a little fuzzy around the edges. But the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s shot has really started to lose details and its colors have become more muted. I think the colors in the S20 Plus shot remain well-balanced even if details like the Wells Fargo sign are beginning to blur.And if we keep zooming beyond that? Well, then we see why it’s no great loss that a 100x zoom didn’t make the cut for the Galaxy S10 Plus. Even at just 30x, my hands are too shaky to keep the photo of the Tribune Tower in focus. The Wells Fargo sign is a total blur and even the hands on the tower’s clock are indistinct.One of the other lenses on the back of the Galaxy S20 Plus — that 12MP ultra wide angle lens — can help you pull back to include more of the surrounding scene in shots. To illustrate just what it can capture, I took a photo of this mosaic at a local marketplace. The Galaxy S20 struggles a little bit with lighting in this first shot, with some of the colors coming close to getting washed out on the right side of the photo where the shadows give way to sunlight. The colors on the iPhone’s are darker, but that helps the camera pull off a much better balancing act between shadow and light.Pulling back with the ultra wide angle lens on both phones, we include more of the area around the mosaic. There’s a noticeable bend to the framing columns in the iPhone’s shot, while the palm tree planters look a little more elongated in the Galaxy S20 Plus’ version. Still, it’s the Samsung phone that keeps the distortion to a minimum when widening out the frame. The biggest takeaway here, though, is that the S20 Plus continues to struggle a little bit with keeping colors balanced as lighting conditions shift. It offers the brighter photo, but the darker look in the iPhone image calls out more detail and isn’t as over-exposed.The Galaxy S20 Plus’ penchant for punching up colors comes in handy when I photographed a watermelon radish salad. Here, the brighter hues the S20 Plus chooses to highlight make its photo look more appealing than the darker iPhone 11 Pro Max shot. That said, there’s a little bit of overexposure in the upper left corner of the S20 Plus photo, as that camera struggles with some light streaming from a nearby window.I find the iPhone’s Night mode easier to use than what Samsung offers with the Galaxy S20 Plus. The iPhone’s version kicks in automatically, while you’ve got to tap the More option on the S20 Plus’ camera menu before tapping Night. (Fortunately, you can drag and drop Night to the main camera menu.) The Galaxy S20 Plus’ visual cue to hold your phone steady while it processes the shot is a little more visible than what the iPhone provides, though.I placed some miniature baseball hats in an unlit basement workshop and snapped a photo using the Night mode on both the S20 Plus and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Neither shot blew me away. The S20 Plus seems to do a better job keeping the hats in focus, though neither camera handled the red helmets in the back row with much aplomb. The S20 Plus over-corrected the color of the wood shelves to the left side, making them look almost red instead of the more natural brown that the iPhone 11 Pro Max used. As for portraits, the iPhone maintains an edge, but the time-of-flight sensor on the S20 Plus narrows the gap somewhat. I was impressed by how Samsung’s phone handled my daughter’s hair, with only a few of the strands behind her left ear getting caught up in the stylized background blur. The iPhone 11 Pro Max’s blur is over aggressive, catching my daughter’s ears. Still, the iPhone 11 Pro does a better job recreating her complexion, from the flush in her cheeks to the freckles on her nose. Live Focus on th S20 Plus overly smooths her face, making those freckles too faint.The same over-smoothing happened when I took a self-portrait with the 10MP front camera on the Galaxy S20 Plus. Overall, the S20’s effort looks sharp, but my coloring in the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s selfie is a little more true-to-life. It was only when I looked at these photos side-by-side that I noticed the S20 Plus snaps a mirror image by default. To flip your selfies around, you’ve got to dive into the camera settings, which seems like an unnatural step.Video shot by the S20 Plus in its native FHD resolution looks crisp and smooth. You can also adjust settings to capture 8K video with the phone’s rear camera, though its hard to evaluate how the footage looks without an 8K display handy. I didn’t notice any of the autofocus issues that have plagued the Galaxy S20 Ultra when testing the Plus, though when I tried shooting 8K video in a dark room, the camera took a little bit longer to focus. I wouldn’t imagine that’s a dealbreaker, though.An enjoyable addition to the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus is Single Take, a mode that captures various types of media through all of the phone's lenses in one shot, so you can then select the one you prefer after the fact. It’s a pretty useful tool that eliminates the tedium of taking the same photo multiple times using different cameras and effects. You’ll have to dive into the S20’s Gallery to see what Single Take produces, though I also noticed different options appear in Google Photos for shots I captured with Single Take.Like the other two S20 models, the Galaxy S20 Plus features a quad-HD AMOLED display capable of a 120-Hz refresh rate. This is  the first time Samsung has ever fitted 120-Hz panels on its phones, and the one in the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus specifically measures 6.7 inches from corner to corner.Most smartphone screens employ 60Hz refresh rates; 120Hz means animations are doubly smooth, because contents on screen are updated twice as often. Samsung has also doubled the panel's touch sampling rate to 240 Hz, making these latest Galaxy handsets feel more responsive than ever.While most games won't make full use of the faster refresh rate, Samsung tells us that Forza Street, by Microsoft, will be updated to take advantage of the capability. Otherwise, you'll certainly feel the difference when thumbing around the One UI interface and third-party apps; navigating Android just feels so much more immediate at 120 Hz.I put the Galaxy S20 Plus next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and began scrolling around ESPN’s web page. The difference is like night and day — while the S20 Plus’ scroll felt smooth and continuous, the iPhone 11 Pro Max felt comparatively herky-jerky. The iPhone’s screen isn’t bad-looking by any measure, but the S20 Plus’ faster refresh rate left it in the dust.The difference is less noticeable when you put the S20 Plus side-by-side with a phone that has a 90Hz screen, such as the Google Pixel 4 XL. I suppose someone with sharper vision than myself can look at the two displays and pinpoint the exact ways that the 120Hz screen on the S20 Plus looks smoother than the Pixel 4 XL’s 90Hz screen. But seeing the phones next to each other, I didn’t exactly feel shortchanged by the Pixel 4 experience.  That’s noteworthy, since the S20 Plus’ smoother screen performance comes with a trade-off. To achieve that 120-Hz animation, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus scales back the display resolution to full HD, which is below the native quad HD of the panel. That translates to text and graphics that look a bit blurrier than you'd expect.Still, you're free to ratchet up the resolution to quad HD, but then you'll fall back to ordinary 60Hz animations. This limitation was ostensibly done to limit drain on battery life, as increases in both resolution and refresh rate can reduce longevity on a charge. And even though previous Samsung handsets defaulted to full-HD resolution, despite also shipping with quad HD screens, the trade-off is still somewhat disappointing even if you’ll really need to stare at the screen to spot the difference.Since this review was first posted, Samsung came out with the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, which features a dynamic 120Hz screen that adjusts its refresh rate depending on what you're doing with your phone. (Activities that don't benefit from faster refresh rates revet to 60Hz, as a battery-saving measure.) The Note 20 Ultra's take on faster refreshing screens is an impressive one, and that phone costs only $100 more than the S20 Plus.As for the S20 Plus display itself, it’s a pleasure to watch videos and games unfold across all 6.7 inches of the Galaxy S20 Plus’ panel. Playing PUBG Mobile, I saw details and graphic flourishes that simply get lost on smaller screens. And the No Time to Die trailer allowed me to see every twitch of Daniel Craig’s clenched jaw, though scenes that take place in the dark look especially dark. (We’ll chalk that up to OLED’s tendency to reproduce truer blacks.)The Galaxy S20 Plus’ screen is nice and bright, measuring 847 nits on a light meter. That’s brighter than the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s 761 nits and the peak 662 nits we recorded with the Galaxy S20 Ultra. I certainly had no trouble seeing the screen of the S20 Plus when outdoors.When it comes to colors, the S20 Plus performs similarly to the S20 Ultra, displaying 224.4% of the sRGB color spectrum. (Samsung’s larger phone manages 231.1%. Colors could be more accurate. While the Delta-E rating of 0.36 for the Galaxy S20 Plus is solid, it’s not as good as the 0.28 score for the iPhone 11 Pro Max display. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.)Although Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 865 processor is sure to wind up in a number of premium Android handsets throughout 2020, it landed in Galaxy S20 line first. Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus buyers also get a generous 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, though they have the option to increase capacity to up to 512GB as well.Because the Galaxy S20 Plus has the same Snapdragon 865 chipset and 12GB of RAM as the Galaxy S20 Ultra base model, it's no surprise that Samsung's 6.7-inch phone matches the performance of the 6.9-inch Ultra — and that's a good thing. The S20 Plus posted a nearly identical multicore score to the S20 Ultra on the Geekbench 5 general performance test — 3,076.3 for the S20 Plus and 3,076.7 for the S20 Ultra. Those were the best Geekbench scores we've ever seen on any Android phone when we tested back in the spring, though they're still short of the 3,517 score turned in by the A13 Bionic-powered iPhone 11 Pro Max. The OnePlus 8 Pro outscored the Galaxy S20 Plus in Geekbench, too, and we imagine the Snapdragon 865 Plus-powered Note 20 lineup will outperform the S20 series.When we tested for graphics, the Galaxy S20 Plus turned in a result of 1,319 frames (21 frames per second) in GFXBench's Aztec Ruins Vulkan test (off-screen). That's essentially identical to how the Galaxy S20 Ultra performed and well ahead of last year leading Android phones like the Galaxy Note 10 Plus (1,058 frames) and the OnePlus 7T (1,169). The iPhone 11 Pro Max remains the standard to beat, though, with its 1,657-frame score (25 fps).We're also encouraged by how the Snapdragon 865 boosts the Galaxy S20 Plus in real-world applications. We test phones by having them transcode a 4K video to 1080p after applying an effect and transition in Adobe Rush. The iPhone usually breezes through this test, while Snapdragon-powered devices slog through it. And while the S20 Plus' time of 1 minute, 13 seconds was no match for the 45 seconds it took the iPhone 11 Pro Max to transcode the video, it's a big jump forward from the Galaxy Note 10's time of 1 minute, 34 seconds. The S20 Plus also beat the S20 Ultra's time by 3 seconds.In everyday use, the Snapdragon 865 inside the Galaxy S20 Plus hums along. My PUBG Mobile sessions never included any stutters or frame drops like I’ve gotten used to playing the game on older devices. And switching between apps is a breeze thanks to all that RAM Samsung packed into the phone.The addition of the Snapdragon 865 also means that the Galaxy S20 Plus supports 5G data. And unlike the standard Galaxy S20 — which could connect only to lower-speed, broad-coverage, sub-6GHz 5G before Samsung released a special version that worked on Verizon's 5G network — the S20 Plus and S20 Ultra can connect to the faster, albeit shorter-range millimeter wave (mmWave) networks as well.Each of the major U.S. carriers offers a slightly different mix of 5G infrastructure. (AT&T and T-Mobile largely focused on low band, though they're building out their 5G networks — particularly T-Mobile, which has absorbed Spring's midband spectrum.) This means that no matter which carrier you use, you'll get some version of 5G coverage on the S20 Plus and S20 Ultra.Or at least, you will if you live in the right area. I’m in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I’ve got SIM cards from both T-Mobile and Verizon on hand, but neither carrier had turned on their 5G service in my neck of the woods at the time I was testing the phone. AT&T has — both its far-reaching low-band network, buttressed in select locations by high-speed 5G service — but I’m unable to test for myself. Given that 5G networks are still in the process of rolling out, you may find yourself in a similar boat — living someplace that’s served by some, though not all, of the wireless carriers building out their 5G coverage.As a result, I can only rely on Tom’s Guide experience testing 5G on other Galaxy S20 models. And the results have shown us that 5G connectivity, while certainly a valuable feature further down the road, is not reason enough to pick up a Galaxy S20 model now. Using the S20 Ultra on T-Mobile’s 5G network in New York, my colleague Mark Spoonauer saw speeds barely faster (and in some cases, worse) than LTE. Performance was better in New Jersey where speeds topped 180 Mbps. (Still not blazing fast, but an improvement over LTE.) Verizon’s high-speed network can reach those 1 Gbps-plus speeds, but the signal’s reach is limited and mostly restricted to outdoors. Third-party testing firms have reached similar conclusions in their 5G performance testing.5G will be a must-have feature in a few years, and if you get a Galaxy S20 Plus now and hold onto it for two years or more, you’ll reap the rewards of 5G network improvements. But right now, don’t expect to experience a new era of always-available faster performance.Samsung's gifted the Galaxy S20 Plus with a big battery to keep that powerful processor, souped-up display and all those camera lenses humming along.At 4,500 mAh, the Plus variant's battery equals the capacity of the one inside last year's Galaxy S10 5G. That phone lasted 10 hours, 56 minutes on our Tom's Guide battery test, in which we have a phone surf the web continuously over a cellular connection with the screen set to 150 nits of brightness. So you'd expect the Galaxy S20 Plus to match the result.The S20 Plus certainly came close when we ran our battery test, holding out for 10 hours, 31 minutes with the screen set to the default 60Hz refresh rate. While that's better than the average smartphone, we would have hoped the S20 Plus' result would have come closer to 11 hours like the S10 5G did. Perhaps surfing the web over T-Mobile's 5G network accounts for the difference, as last year's S10 5G test ran on Verizon's network over LTE.One other word about the S20 Plus' battery life — it takes a severe hit if you enable the 120Hz refresh rate. We re-ran the test with the faster refresh rate turned on, and the S20 Plus turned in a time of 8 hours and 55 minutes — more than 90 minutes worse than when the phone's screen was set to a 60Hz refresh rate. We saw a similar drop when we tested the Galaxy S20 Ultra's battery, so it's easy to understand why the 120Hz refresh rate isn't a default setting.In regular use, the Galaxy S20 Plus’ battery has proved fairly resilient. I took a fully charged Galaxy S20 Plus and spent a healthy chunk of the next 24 hours, taking photos, playing games, watching videos and poking my away around — with the 120Hz refresh rating turned on for much of that time. I ended that test period with 32% of the battery remaining, so it’s clear you’ll be able to go through the day without needing to find a place to charge the S20 Plus.The Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus ships with a 25-watt fast charger, which should get the S20 Plus juiced back up relatively quickly. Our testing backed that up. After charging a drained S20 Plus battery for 30 minutes using the supplied charger, the phone's battery indicator was back to 55%. Of course, we got the same result recharging an iPhone 11 Pro, and Apple's phone only features an 18-watt charger. (For a deeper comparison between these two phones, check out our Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus vs. iPhone 11 Pro face-off.)To goose the Galaxy S20 Plus' recharge time, you could buy Samsung's 45-watt brick, but that adds $49 to the cost of your phone.All Galaxy S20 phones come with Samsung’s new One UI 2 software, which streamlines the interface to make it easier to jump into your favorite apps, change settings and more. This rides on top of Android 10, which includes great new features like Smart Reply, a dark mode and better privacy controls. Samsung is also trying to build better experiences into the S20 line, starting with Google Duo integration. Google’s answer to FaceTime, this video chat app is built right into the phone dialer and contacts apps, and you can video chat with up to 8 people. Plus, you can video chat in full HD for the first time.Other software features include Music Share for sharing out your Bluetooth connection to your car (so someone else can control the playlist for a while) and Spotify integration with Bixby routines, so your Galaxy will recommend playlists based on your preference and even the moment of the day.After largely resisting the recent trend toward pricier flagships, Samsung has thrown caution to the wind with the S20 trio, releasing the most advanced smartphones it has ever made — at least until the Note 20 Ultra came along. And while the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus may not have the S20 Ultra's attention-grabbing 108MP main camera, it has enough of everything else — the quartet of lenses, the top-of-the-line processor, the roomy screen and the comprehensive 5G support — that it’s arguably a better value than that $1,399. For $200 less, you’re getting equally capable cameras, better-than-average battery life and performance that matches Samsung’s pricier phone. What’s not to like? Well, the Galaxy S20 Plus' price, for starters. It may not cost as much as the Ultra, but $1,199 isn't exactly cheap. As good as the cameras on the S20 Plus are — and they top the pace-setting iPhone 11 Pro cameras in some areas — the pictures aren’t so much better that they merit a $100 to $200 price bump over Apple’s phones. What the S20 Plus gives you that the iPhone 11 Pro doesn’t are a 120Hz refresh rate and 5G.The Galaxy S20 Plus represents Samsung’s best mix of high-end features and still-attainable price, at least if you’re all right with paying $1,199 for a phone. It’s got better battery life than the less expensive Galaxy S20 and comes close enough to matching the S20 Ultra so that you won’t feel short-changed if you opt for this model. The Galaxy S20 Plus definitely tests the upper limits of what mainstream smartphone shoppers should be willing to pay for a handset, but overall this the best S20 model of the three in terms of what you get for the money.Adam Ismail contributed to an earlier version of this review."
93,Google Pixel 3a,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-pixel-3a,review-6452.html","The Google Pixel 3a is less than half the price of most flagship phones, and yet it doesn’t look or feel cheap. That’s because Google delivers the features most users really care about with this device, including a vivid 5.6-inch OLED display, a fantastic camera and all of the company’s clever software, for just $399.However, it's been replaced on our list of the best phones by its successor, the new Google Pixel 4a. While last year's model is still one of the best cheap phones out there, Google has since discontinued it, plus the Pixel 4a is a superior phone in practically every way and costs $50 less.Nevertheless, the Pixel 3a is still worth picking up if you can find one at a compelling discount. That's especially true for those interested in the Pixel 3a XL for its larger display, as Google skipped making a 4a XL variant for the latest generation.Editors' Note: The Pixel 3a had made way for the Pixel 4a, of course, but you can see what's new in our Google Pixel 4a vs. Pixel 3a face-off.Until recently, the Pixel 3a was available for $399 from most carriers and retailers, but has since been discontinued and replaced by the Pixel 4a. That said, you can still find it at T-Mobile.There’s only one configuration of the Pixel 3a and 3a XL, with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Neither phone features a microSD card slot, so there’s no way to expand that limited amount of space if you fill it all up with photos and apps. The system itself takes up about 5GB, and once you factor in pre-installed apps, you’re looking at around 50GB of usable storage out of the box.The Pixel 3a doesn’t feel cheap, though its polycarbonate back does give away its price. This phone is also very light and compact, measuring 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches and weighing just 5.2 ounces. As someone who uses the hulking iPhone XS Max with its 6.5-inch screen, the Pixel 3a seems almost cute.The Pixel 3a is available in Just Black, Clearly White and Purple-ish, and I gravitated towards the latter because it just seems more fun. The trademark two-tone Pixel design, combining matte and glossy surfaces on the back, has been kept intact for the Pixel 3a; although this device is technically made of plastic, it honestly feels almost as sturdy and strong as glass. This is hardly the most breathtaking handset out there aesthetically speaking, but there’s no denying it’s well made.As for the front, Google has replaced Corning’s Gorilla Glass, used in the pricier models, with AGC’s Dragontrail strengthened glass — an alternative usually found in cheaper handsets. And just as the back of the Pixel 3a is a spitting image of those other Pixel phones, so too is the front. The only noticeable differences are the lack of a second front-facing camera for wide-angle selfies, and a slightly thicker bottom bezel without a second speaker stashed below the display.While the Pixel 3a does still feature stereo sound, it fires audio through the earpiece and slits beside the USB Type-C port along the lower edge. Those speakers can get pretty loud, but the quality appears a bit more compressed than what you get from the Pixel 3 and 3 XL.Thankfully, all Pixel 3a phones come with a headphone jack, but none of them offer water resistance. That latter point is a bit of a bummer, though not at all unusual for phones in this price range. And although it’s a small point, I have to commend Google for incorporating the Pixel 3’s fantastic haptic motor in this phone. Tapping away at on-screen keys on the 3a feels so much nicer than it does on any similarly-priced handset, thanks to perfectly weighted blips that fire immediately.I’m glad that Google went the OLED route for the Pixel 3a’s screen, which means you’ll enjoy vibrant colors, wide viewing angles and perfect blacks for a good price. The resolution is pretty good, too, at 2220x1080 pixels.In fact, if having an OLED panel is important to you, the Pixel 3a currently offers the cheapest path to getting one. Just don’t expect the finest display for the price.Next to the Pixel 3, the 3a’s screen falls short in terms of color intensity and exhibits a warmer white balance, even when on Dynamic mode, the most saturated of the three profiles the handset offers. It’s by no means a poor experience — rest assured, we’re not talking Pixel 2 XL-levels of disappointment here — but it does leave a bit to be desired if you’ve ever been mesmerized by the really fantastic OLED panels in the latest Galaxy S handsets and iPhones.The Pixel 3a’s display could be brighter, too. It was tough to make out the Avengers: Endgame trailer in sunlight even when the phone was set to maximum brightness. With a peak of 401 nits, this display comes in well below the 488-nit average, though its sRGB color gamut coverage and Delta-E accuracy scores of 182.3% and 0.18, respectively, are very good and in line with modern flagships.If having an OLED panel is important to you, the Pixel 3a currently offers the cheapest path to getting one. Just don’t expect the finest display for the price.Ultimately, what few complaints you’d have about the Pixel 3a’s screen feel like nitpicks given how little you’re paying. In an $800 phone, you might feel short-changed, but in a device that costs half that, getting a good but not great OLED feels like a bargain — minor imperfections and all.Personally, I'd probably opt for the 6-inch Pixel 3a XL, as I would want more real estate for typing and watching videos, but there is a $80/£70 price difference between the two variants.Google deserves credit for bringing all of the key camera features of the Pixel 3 to its cheaper cousin. The Pixel 3a offers a single rear camera at 12.2 megapixels with a f/1.8 aperture, and it can do all sorts of tricks. That includes Night Sight, which allows you to capture great photos even in complete darkness, as well as bokeh Portrait Mode and Super Res Zoom, for digital zoom that’s comparable with optical.If you had any doubt the Pixel 3a would be able to punch above its weight class, this portrait it captured of my colleague Caitlin should put those fears to rest. The optics and much of the hardware behind the Pixel 3a’s rear camera is identical to what you get in the Pixel 3; the only difference is that the 3a lacks the Pixel Visual Core image processing chip.You’re getting Night Sight, in all its reality-defying glory, in a $400 phone.That doesn’t appear to be a massive setback, however, as the 3a still has the muscle to deliver a shot that exceeds the Galaxy S10 Plus’ best effort in many respects. Caitlin’s skin tone is better represented through the Pixel’s lens, and while I could do without some of the unusual artifacting along the left side of her face, the S10 Plus’ strange metering and more zoomed-out perspective are more egregious faults to my eye.You could certainly make the argument that the S10 Plus won out in this comparison between shots of a pink rose, but the Pixel 3a’s result is so much closer than a phone that costs less than half the price has any right to be. Samsung’s rendition is a hair sharper across the board, and the company’s Scene Optimizer tech was able to punch up those shades of magenta in the petals, to produce a more vivid shot than Google’s handset could manage. But then the Pixel 3a’s attempt is still very, very good, with a bit more detail rendered in some areas where the S10 Plus trades definition for saturated colors.It’s only when you see what the Pixel 3a can do compared to a phone roughly the same price that you really begin to appreciate how special its camera is. The shot from the edge of Bryant Park as captured by the $349/£300 Nokia 7.1 isn’t bad at all, but it falls short in ways even the best midrange phones for photography do. The sky is blown out, the foliage is sort of blurry, the patina of the grass is glazed over and ultimately the way the Nokia lit the scene simply isn’t true to the day’s actual conditions. And yet the Pixel 3a can effortlessly render this gloomy scene in a beautiful way.And then, of course, there’s Night Sight — a feature that has made its way to the Pixel 3a gloriously intact, and capable of the same feats of software magic that it grants in the Pixel 3. In fact, compared to the Pixel 3, it’s hard to notice a difference in the quality of the photos between them; perhaps the flagship’s example is a hair warmer, maybe the shadow of the railings against the green-painted wood is a bit more pronounced through the lens of the pricier model. Though again, these are negligible differences you likely wouldn’t notice unless you were deliberately looking for them. The fact is, you’re getting Night Sight, in all its reality-defying glory, in a $400 phone.Finally, the Pixel 3a’s front 8-MP camera is serviceable, but you don’t get the extra wide-angle lens that the regular Pixel 3 offers, so group selfies are a little more challenging. The Pixel 3a’s front-facing shooter can’t autofocus, either, which means you’ll have to be careful about how you position your mug in those instances. All that considered, though, the Pixel 3a can still take a pretty satisfying selfie that’s once again right up alongside flagship metal.Armed with a Snapdragon 670 processor and 4GB of RAM, the Pixel 3a feels snappy enough for everyday tasks. In fact, most of the time, it was hard to discern a difference in responsiveness compared to the Snapdragon 845-powered Pixel 3 with respect to opening and closing software and scrolling in apps.MORE: Best Apps for Benchmarking Smartphones or TabletsThe sprightly performance isn’t quite so surprising once you look at the benchmarks. The Pixel 3a punched in a score of 5,146 in the system-wide Geekbench 4 test. For a bit of perspective, that’s almost smack-dab in the middle between the original Pixel’s 4,176 result and the Pixel 2, at 6,282. The Nokia 7.1, a modern adversary for the Pixel 3a featuring a slightly less-powerful Snapdragon 636 CPU, couldn’t quite match Google’s new handset, as it fell just short at 4,953.All of that bodes well for the Pixel 3a in an everyday context. Where you're likely start to notice lag is when playing demanding games, or using the camera a lot. (It's still one of our best handheld gaming consoles, thanks to its good selection and Google Stadia compatibility.) Although the Pixel 3a can pull off many of the same computational photography tricks that Google’s more expensive models can, all that image crunching is happening on less-capable silicon, and without Google’s Pixel Visual Core to speed things along. That means sometimes you’ll have to wait a hair longer for HDR+ photos or bokeh-effect portraits to finish processing after the fact. It’s not deal-breaking lag by any stretch, but it can happen.As for gaming, the Pixel 3a fares better than most phones at its price range, though it handles some titles better than others. PUBG Mobile wasn’t much of a sweat for the baby Pixel, though Asphalt 9: Legends was a choppier, blurrier experience. This is hardly surprising given the handset’s 1,602 score in 3DMark’s Sling Shot OpenGL ES 3.1 test — a long way from the Pixel 3’s 4,400 points, let alone the Galaxy S10’s best effort of 5,606.The Pixel 3a comes with a fairly small battery at 3,000 mAh, though that’s still a bit more than you get from the 2,915-mAh capacity of the Pixel 3. Coupled with the Pixel 3a’s processor, which features more cores dedicated for low power consumption rather than high performance, this phone can actually last quite a bit longer on a charge than its premium counterpart.Google’s latest handset turned in 11 hours and 59 minutes in our battery test, where the device cycled through web pages over an LTE connection at 150 nits brightness until it ran out of juice. That’s significantly longer than the $349/£300 Nokia 7.1’s 7:42 result, and even exceeds Apple’s $749/£749 iPhone XR, which managed 11:26.MORE: Best phone battery life: Longest lasting smartphone batteriesEven better, you could get as many as 7 hours of battery life with just 15 minutes of fast charging; the Pixel 3a comes with an 18-watt fast charger in the box. Unfortunately however, Google did have to skimp on the Pixel 3’s wireless charging to achieve the lower price.Google’s latest handset turned in 11 hours and 59 minutes in our battery test, which beats the iPhone XR.While I suspect many budget buyers will flock to the Pixel 3a for its camera, Google’s work on the software side of things shouldn’t be overlooked. Because even in this cheaper handset, Google has brought its best and most innovative features to the forefront.That includes Call Screen, which leverages the power of artificial intelligence to deal with unidentified callers so you don’t have to, as well as Active Edge, which lets you quickly launch Google Assistant only by squeezing the sides of the device.The Pixel 3a launches with Android 9 Pie, though it already is eligible for the Android Q Beta, and will receive the full release as soon as it launches for the public in late summer or early fall.Really, the best thing you can say about the Pixel 3a’s software experience is that there isn’t much to say about it; this is the same great flavor of Android that people buy $800 Pixel flagships for, but now it’s running on hardware that costs half that. And the fact it also comes with three years of guaranteed software updates and monthly security patches ensures a level of support that no other smartphone at this price range enjoys.The only gripe I have is that the Pixel 3a misses out on the two years of unlimited original-quality uploads to Google Photos that every previous Pixel has enjoyed. Rather, you get the same limited 15GB allotment for full-resolution images and unlimited “high quality” storage that every other Android phone is already eligible for.The Pixel 3a is a steal for those who simply don't want to spend a lot on their next phone and still get a great camera. The specs are decent for the $399/£399 price, and you don't have to deal with the usual carrier bloatware that you'll typically find on other midrange phones.In fact, aside from a slight hit to performance, the Pixel 3a avoids nearly all of the frustrations that ordinarily befall other cheap handsets — and that includes good ones like the $349/£300 Nokia 7.1 and $299/£240 Moto G7. The build quality is excellent, the display is a cut above any run-of-the-mill LCD screen, the battery lasts very long on a charge, and the software consists of Google’s latest and greatest services, with the promise of quick updates for three years. Most budget devices are lucky to see one update in their entire lifetime.Of course, the Pixel 3a's biggest rival is Google's new Pixel 4a, which offers a better processor, camera, design and display for $50 less. The 4a has rendered the 3a obsolete, sadly, especially because you can't buy a new Pixel 3a from most official retail channels anymore. That said, if you can track one down for well under list price or perhaps secondhand, it remains a great choice for just about anyone in need of a great cheap phone."
94,Asus ROG Phone 3,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/asus-rog-phone-3,"Starting price: €999 ($1,184) Display: 6.6-inch AMOLED (2340x1080; 144 Hz) CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus RAM: 12GB, 16GB Storage: 512GB SD Card slot: None Rear cameras: 64MP wide (ƒ/1.8), 13MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.4), 5MP macro (ƒ/2.0) Front camera: 24MP (ƒ/2.0) Battery: 6,000 mAh Charging: 30 watts Security: Fingerprint sensor, PIN Operating system: Android 10 Size: 6.7 x 3.1 x 0.4 inches Weight: 8.5 ouncesThe Asus ROG Phone 3 may not be as powerful as the upcoming PS5 or Xbox Series X, but it's a heck of a lot more practical. Think about it. Which is going to get more use: A device that you have to hook up to your living room TV for games and movies, or a device that you can take with you absolutely anywhere and use for any number of productivity and leisure activities?And yet, the ROG Phone 3 isn't just the best gaming phone available right now; it's arguably one of the best handheld gaming consoles out there — provided you like Android games, at any rate.As a gaming device, the ROG Phone 3 succeeds in just about every way. It plays high-end mobile games beautifully, and its built-in software gives you all the tools you need to customize and optimize your experience. Long battery life means that you can game for hours, and a handy included fan/kickstand makes it easy to hook up a controller and play for hours. Naturally, since the phone is so powerful, it also excels at most day-to-day tasks.Granted, the ROG Phone 3's ambitious specs come with some drawbacks. The phone heats up very easily when gaming, and using the fan to keep it cool creates a whole new set of problems. It's also possible to chew through the battery pretty fast, depending on how fancy you want your games to look. The phone's sheer size makes it a little unwieldy for everyday use — but it's still not quite big enough to stream PC or console games in great detail.Still, if you want a gaming system that also happens to be a well-rounded smartphone, the ROG Phone 3 is a compelling, albeit potentially expensive, choice. Read on for our full Asus ROG Phone 3 review.The Asus ROG Phone 3 is not widely available yet. There’s no official U.S. pricing for the ROG Phone 3 right now, and there won't be until September. In the meantime, Asus France has listed the 12GB RAM variant for €999 ($1,184) and the 16GB RAM variant for €1,099 ($1,302). Both come with 512GB of storage, and there’s no SD card slot to expand that further. Granted, phones in Europe tend to be a little more expensive than phones in the United States, but we still wouldn't expect the ROG Phone 3 for less than $1,000 when it makes its way here.The first thing I noticed about the ROG Phone 3 is that it's enormous. The phone itself is 6.7 inches long, which will surely try even the deepest pockets. It's also quite heavy at 8.5 ounces. Carrying it around can be a pain (almost literally), and it's not easy to hold for long periods of time — for the heat as much as for the weight, but we'll get to that.While I never did quite get used to the screen's ratio, the ROG Phone 3 is a pretty device otherwise. The front of the device is almost all screen, with small black bezels on the top and bottom. On the right, there's a power button and a volume button. On the back, there's a shiny reflective surface with a tasteful ROG logo in the center. While the phone is a bit of a fingerprint magnet, I do have to give it credit for some of its subtle aesthetic choices.The left side of the phone is where things get interesting, as there's a hard-to-remove plastic plug that reveals a proprietary port. This is where the fan plugs in, and I can safely say that the ROG Phone 3 is the very first smartphone I've ever used to come with its own external cooling system.While the fan enables some cool features (and is downright necessary to play demanding games at higher settings), I found myself less thrilled with the device than I'd hoped. First off, the fan can be a real pain to connect and disconnect, between the hard-to-remove rubber plug, extendable clamp and very tight kickstand. While the fan is not that loud on its own, it's close enough to the phone's mics that it can be extremely disruptive if you get a call or need to record something. It also drains the battery to the point where you'll probably want to plug in when you use it.The Asus ROG Phone 3 features a 6.6-inch, 2340 x 1080 AMOLED screen, which supports frame rates up to 144 Hz. I never quite got used to the extremely wide 19:5:9 aspect ratio, but otherwise, it's a gorgeous display, with rich colors: 168% of the sRGB spectrum, to be precise, with a Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.31. The latter even beats out the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus’ Delta-E score of 0.36. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)In terms of brightness, the screen can get up to 419 nits under ordinary circumstances, and up to 646 nits with automatic brightness on. Considering that even computer monitors tend to max out somewhere around 350 nits, the ROG Phone 3 is plenty bright, and I had no trouble reading the screen in broad daylight.The phone's frame rate is what really sets it apart from non-gaming models. Generally speaking, it's a huge boon in demanding games, and not really necessary otherwise. But it's also easy to control, thanks to Asus's proprietary software, so it does no harm, at worst, and a lot of good, at best.With three powerful rear cameras and one high-res front camera, the Asus ROG Phone 3 doesn't skimp on picture quality. At the same time, it's arguably not up to the standards of a phone that sells itself on its camera, such as the iPhone 11 Pro or the Pixel 4.Without going into excruciating detail about the cameras, the three lenses on the back comprise a 64-MP primary shooter, a 13-MP ultrawide one and a 5-MP macro, respectively, while the one on the front is rated at 24MP. There are a respectable number of options for taking photos and videos, including Pro Video, Time Lapse, Motion Tracking, Portrait, Night Mode and Macro — which is particularly interesting, since it lets you get ultra-close-ups, within just a few inches of your subject.Since I don't think many people will be buying the ROG Phone 3 primarily for its camera, I spent most of my time in its general Photo mode, and was reasonably pleased with the results. Indoors shots were sharp, although the color balance felt a little washed out, particularly when the camera had to balance a lot of different colors at once, as in the case of books or DVD cases. Outdoor shots fared much better, with more naturalistic color balance — although reds felt supersaturated and not as lifelike as greens, whites and blues.The ROG Phone 3's camera options are neither as subtle nor as extensive as what you'd get from a dedicated camera phone, but it does boast some very powerful hardware and enough tweakable options that you can do some impressive photography with it, if you're so inclined.My one big complaint was that no matter what I did, the camera would not automatically rotate horizontal shots. If you take a lot of pictures and need to upload them later, having to rotate them manually, one at a time, is an enormous pain, and something that barely any other phone forces you to do. I can't imagine why Asus made this baffling choice, and I hope a future software update offers some kind of auto-rotate option.A gaming phone — particularly one that costs more than $1,000 — lives or dies by its performance, and the Asus ROG Phone 3 has a lot to offer in this category. Let's get the easy stuff out of the way first: Everyday tasks are effortless on the ROG Phone 3. Social media, calls, texts and so forth pose no challenge to a system that's geared for gaming, so navigation is quick and responsive, videos are smooth and colorful and if there's an app that the phone can't handle, I couldn't find it.In terms of artificial benchmarks, the ROG Phone 3 scored 3,393 on the Geekbench multi-core test. Compare and contrast to the Samsung Galaxy S20, which scored 3,147, and the iPhone 11 Pro, which scored 3,509. With its Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and up to 16 GB RAM, the ROG Phone 3 is one of the most powerful phones on the market, although Apple's A13 chip seems to still have a slight edge.The more interesting question is how the ROG Phone 3 handles games, and the answer is: extremely well, with one moderate exception. The timing on this ROG Phone 3 review worked out extremely well, as Bandai Namco has just released Tales of Crestoria: an intricate mobile RPG that can take full advantage of powerful phones with detailed and demanding graphical settings. (More Western fans really need to play the Tales series, but I digress.)As someone who's been playing the Tales series since the PlayStation days, I can safely say that the ROG Phone 3 made Tales of Crestoria look better than any of the series entries on the Xbox 360 or the PS3; the character models gave the PS4 entries a run for their money. Battles were fast and fluid, even when characters launched one particle-effects-laden special attack after another, and the colorful screen made every character look unique and full of personality. The system's robust speakers also gave me a lot of control over the volume level, and sounded surprisingly good for music, voicework and sound effects.The ROG Phone 3 also plays very nicely with game-streaming services, such as Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now. In my tests, games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Doom Eternal ran very fluidly, although the screen was still too small — and perhaps a little too dark — to make out a lot of the fine details necessary for those games. It's a workable option if you need a second screen, although a tablet would probably work better.What helps Tales of Crestoria, and other demanding games Android like PUBG and Fortnite, excel is the ROG Phone 3's Game Genie overlay software, as well as its optional X Mode. Without going into excruciating detail about either function, Game Genie (not to be confused with the '90s cheat code generator of the same name) is a simple overlay that lets you optimize your games as you play them. By simply swiping from the left of the screen, you can use the Game Genie to control frame rate, brightness and other performance metrics for any Android game. You can also tell it to block calls and texts while the game is open, if you want some uninterrupted gaming time. Game Genie doesn't slow down games at all, and it's trivially simple to use. It's a smart and functional way for the ROG Phone 3 to distinguish itself as a ""gaming phone"" beyond just offering powerful specs.X Mode, on the other hand, is a way to sort of supercharge the system specs at the cost of heat output and battery power. There are three different levels, which get progressively more powerful as you go. Level 3, in fact, requires you to plug in the fan, or it won't even activate. X Mode is a worthwhile option, although generally speaking, even the most demanding Android games are well within the ROG Phone 3's regular parameters, so I wonder how useful it will be.(If you decide to use the ROG Phone 3 as an emulator, of course, your performance requirements may vary. But since that's legally murky territory, that's all we can say about it here.)X Mode does highlight the biggest problem with the ROG Phone 3, however: It generates a massive amount of heat. The phone comes with a rubbery grip that covers the back of the device, and I learned quickly that it's not just for show. After gaming for a while, without the grip, the phone feels almost too hot to touch. Overheating can be a problem for games like Tales of Crestoria, which crashed frequently once the phone started to get too warm. The fan helps mitigate this problem, to an extent, but that also means you'll need a cumbersome, battery-draining attachment to facilitate the phone's primary activity.Gaming phones are going to get hot; there's no escaping the laws of physics. But when it gets hot enough to regularly crash games, the tradeoff feels less worthwhile.The Asus ROG Phone 3 supports 5G from most GSM-based networks in the United States, including AT&T and T-Mobile. (The phone doesn't support Verizon mobile networks, as I learned the hard way after trying to insert my own SIM card.) I don't live near a 5G hotspot, and was unable to test this connectivity firsthand, but subscribers who have access to this technology should be able to leverage it with the ROG Phone 3.One thing that consistently impressed me about the Asus ROG Phone 3 was its battery life. In our Tom's Guide battery test, which sets the screen brightness to 150 nits and measures how long it takes the phone to run down while continuously browsing the Web on an LTE network, the ROG Phone 3 lasted for an impressive 14 hours and 30 minutes. Compare and contrast to the 9 hours and 31 minutes you get from a Galaxy S20 or the 10 hours and 24 minutes you get from an iPhone 11 Pro, and the ROG Phone 3 has a big edge in this category. Granted, its 6,000 mAh battery contributes to the phone's weight, and you'll never get 14 hours of uptime if you use the phone primarily for gaming. But it's an impressive number nonetheless. The phone can fully charge in less than three hours with a standard 5V charger, although it doesn't support wireless charging.The Asus ROG Phone 3's most important pieces of software are its Game Genie and X Mode features, discussed in the Performance section above. From an OS standpoint, the phone runs an extremely clean installation of Android 10. However, the phone gets software updates from both Google and Asus, since X Mode and certain other gaming features are built right into the OS itself.Asus has not discussed just how long it plans to support the ROG Phone 3 with security and performance updates. However, based on its strategy with the original ROG Phone and the ROG Phone 2, buyers should expect at least one year of support, and perhaps no more than two years. Unfortunately, there's no standardized amount of time for Android phones to receive support, so we can only say that this is (probably) less than the three years of support offered by Google and Samsung.Our Asus ROG Phone 3 review discussed how the device runs hot, and how it will likely be extremely expensive once it hits the United States. But in spite of a few shortcomings, the ROG Phone 3 accomplishes almost exactly what it sets out to do. It runs demanding Android games beautifully, and gives users a set of intuitive, flawlessly integrated tools to optimize their experiences.At the moment, there aren't many true ""gaming phones"" on the market, since Razer seems to be out of the picture for right now, and Xiaomi's models are a little niche and not sold in many parts of the world. As such the ROG Phone 3 is one of the only viable options if you want a phone that's a game console first and an everyday accessory second.In the same price range, it's still worth considering the Galaxy S20. That phone's raw power is enough to run just about any Android game you'd want, and the camera takes much prettier pictures. But who needs pictures when you've got a portable console in your pocket?"
95,OnePlus Nord,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-nord-review,"Starting price: £379, £469 Display: 6.44-inch AMOLED (2400x1080; 90Hz) CPU: Snapdragon 765G RAM: 8GB, 12GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB SD Card slot: None Rear camera: 48MP wide (ƒ/1.75); 8MP ultrawide; 5MP depth (ƒ/2.4); 2MP macro (ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 32MP (ƒ/2.45) and 8MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.45) Battery: 4,115 mAh  Charging: 30W wired Security: In-display fingerprint, 2D face unlock Operating system: Android 10 with OxygenOS 10.5 Colors: Blue Marble, Gray Onyx Size: 6.23 x 2.88 x 0.32 inches (158.3 x 73.3 x 8.2 mm) Weight: 6.49 ounces (184 grams)The OnePlus Nord is proof that you don't have to build a budget phone by subtraction. OnePlus hasn't made its new entry-level model by removing or downgrading the features of its flagship phone, or reviving an old model with a new coat of paint. Rather, the Nord is the product of a whole new design with high-quality components and features. And as this OnePlus Nord review will demonstrate, the resulting device is both an exciting piece of tech and an easily-rationalized purchase.Unlike other phones at this price, OnePlus has chosen to add some luxurious touches, like a 90Hz refresh rate display, an attractive glass back design and a whopping six cameras across the front and back. The overall performance — particularly when it comes to processing power— is about what you'd expect for the price. However, the phone feels so good to use moment-to-moment you'll never feel like you're missing out on the flagship Android experience by buying a cheaper handset.If you want the best tech OnePlus has to offer, consider going for the OnePlus 8 instead, or even the OnePlus 8 Pro if you don't mind the higher price. If you want to stick to the $400 mark, then you may want to wait and see what Google offers in the upcoming Pixel 4a, or look to Apple's new iPhone SE. But as things stand currently, phone buyers on a modest budget should have the Nord at the top of their shortlist. It's one of the best phones of the year, and it just so happens to be kind to your wallet.Currently the OnePlus Nord is only available for purchase in Europe and India, although OnePlus is considering bringing the Nord to the US at a later date if the phone sells well. If that uncertainty won't do, then until July 28 you can try to sign up to be one of 50 North American beta testers for the Nord.You can pick up the Nord for either £379 for the basic model with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, or spend £469 on the 12GB RAM and 256GB version. That converts to $482 and $597 respectively, which fits with OnePlus' continued assurance that the Nord is a sub-$500 phone.The Nord's chassis belies its price, looking both premium and modern. That's a combination that's hard to find on phones in this price range.The full-screen display immediately makes the Nord look attractive, even if the double-width punch-hole camera notch in the top left corner is a lot more conspicuous than other punch-holes. The display is flat, rather than the more premium curved sides that some Android phones get, but it's not something I missed. If anything, sometimes having flat sides can be easier to use gesture navigation with, as it helps you avoid the irritating accidental presses that were more common on the OnePlus 8 Pro.On the back of the OnePlus Nord, you have a slightly curved glass panel — which feels very comfortable to hold — with a camera block in the top left corner, and some simple logos for decoration. It's a very minimalist look, but that's always been OnePlus' goal, and it's one I think is always worth pursuing.The overall phone is fairly large, measuring 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches and weighing 6.5 ounces. It seems all the more colossal when you compare the Nord to the iPhone SE (5.5 x 2.7 x 0.3 inches and 5.2 ounces) and the Pixel 3a (6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches and 5.2 ounces). But most of that extra size comes in the form of the Nord's height, not its width, which would cause more problems for people with small hands.Perhaps OnePlus' most unfortunate habit is neglecting to have its phones IP tested for dust and water resistance. While it did test the OnePlus 8 Pro, the Nord has no official rating. OnePlus claims the phone is water resistant, but there's no guarantee, so you won't have the peace of mind you'd get with the IP67-rated iPhone SE.For color options, you can pick between Marble Blue or Gray Onyx. Our OnePlus Nord review unit was in blue, and I really like its glossy and cheerful appearance. The blue is also present on the metal side rail of the phone, which gives the phone an attractive design element to admire even if you have it screen up.OnePlus has fitted an FHD 6.44-inch AMOLED display to the Nord, which would be praiseworthy enough on its own. But OnePlus also gave it a 90Hz refresh rate, a feature you don't expect to find on a phone of this price. Taken together, it's the best display I've tried at this price range, and I don't see it being easily beaten.Watching Michaela Coel's sitcom Chewing Gum on the Nord was great fun, as the display excellently rendered the strange and colorful filter the show casts over London's Tower Hamlets. Trying out something moodier with the trailer for Netflix's Cursed, the OLED panel did what it does best and really brought out the blacks of the shadow-cast scenery, while still making the magic effects look exciting and dangerous.The panel is rated for a maximum brightness of 1,000 nits with HDR enabled, or 700 nits normally. We weren't able to measure the brightness ourselves to confirm this, but I had little trouble reading the screen when I took the Nord out for a walk on a sunny day. I was carrying the iPhone SE with me at the same time, and its dimmer LCD display (rated for 625 nits) proved much harder to read without turning it constantly to try and deflect the glare.While rival mid-range phones often have just one camera each front and back, OnePlus has outdone itself by fitting six total cameras to the Nord, which is one more than it gave its flagship OnePlus 8 Pro.On the back, you have a 48MP main camera, 8MP ultra wide camera, 5MP depth sensor and 2MP macro camera. Meanwhile, on the front there's a 32MP main camera and 8MP ultra wide selfie camera.That's a whole lot of lenses. However, OnePlus has historically struggled to keep up with other companies when it comes to photo quality, not quantity of optics. Unfortunately, here is where we see some of those weaknesses return.Take this close-up shot of a thistle, using the main rear camera on the Nord and the single rear camera on the iPhone SE. In terms of image fidelity, it's too close to call a winner. But the color is what makes the difference. The OnePlus' image is much colder, something you notice with pictures from the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro too, be that because of the sensor or OnePlus' post-processing. Meanwhile, the iPhone SE's picture stands in contrast, making the green of the background and the purple of the flower look its best.I also tried this shot with the Nord's 2MP macro camera. We at Tom’s Guide are not big fans of macro cameras, since they seem to often be added onto mid-range and budget devices just so the manufacturer can bump up the sensor count, rather than for any major benefit to the user. I'll admit this is probably the best image I've ever got from a smartphone's macro camera, and I like the sense of depth it gives to the scene. But with murky colors like this, I still see no reason not to take close-ups with the main sensor instead when possible. As a secondary test of the main lenses, I tried this scene of a forest path. Since the background of this shot is a lot darker, the higher resolution sensor on the Nord can come into its own. Being able to make out the leaves on the shaded trees means the OnePlus easily beats the iPhone here, although they're tied if I only look at the foreground.Finally, I waited until nightfall to try out the Nord's Nightscape low-light mode. I was expecting it to conquer the iPhone here, since Apple hasn't fitted the SE with a night mode, unlike its flagship iPhones.  Sure enough, the Nord gives you the colors and detail you need to appreciate the tree, while the iPhone SE can only capture the same scene in gloomy hues that muddy the details in the leaves and tree bark.Another sensor the Nord benefits from is an ultra wide sensor, which I tried out with a shot of these trees on the side of a golf course. There's not really any way to compare the iPhone SE here, it only has a regular, single wide lens for its camera. All I can say is that at least the Nord can produce an ultra wide image, though I'd be curious to see how it compares to an equivalent camera on a more expensive smartphone.Trying out a Portrait mode shot with the OnePlus was a pleasant surprise, thanks to the 5MP depth sensor that rounds out the quartet of cameras. It means you can get bokeh and other photo effects on any shot you like, while the iPhone SE's software-only solution requires a human face before it can start to figure out where to blur the background. So when I took these shots of Holly the beagle, the iPhone moaned that it couldn't detect a face, while the OnePlus simply applied some bokeh to the background, resulting in a pretty decent shot.As a fairer test of the two phones' special effects skills, I turned on portrait mode again to test the selfie cameras. With its depth sensor advantage gone, the Nord still turns out a good shot, with a nice strongly defined foreground and background. The iPhone SE does much the same, except the colors are more saturated. I don't think the color temperature difference here is as big a problem for the Nord as it was in our earlier thistle comparison, but it's still enough for me to declare the SE's image the better one here.There's still one more Nord camera to look at: the ultra wide selfie camera. To show what it can do, here's a normal landscape selfie taken with the Nord's main front camera.And below is what the same shot looks like with the ultra-wide sensor instead.You get so much extra selfie space with this sensor enabled, which is great if you have a large landscape to capture or many friends to fit into a shot. But since there's still a moderate lockdown in the U.K., I don't have either, so you'll have to enjoy how much more of the trees and shrubs behind me you can see instead.You can't dispute the fact that OnePlus is offering a diverse range of photo options on the Nord. The macro lens is a waste of space as far as I'm concerned, but the rest of them produce good shots, with a few beating the class-leading iPhone SE thanks to OnePlus' more generous hardware and the smart inclusion of Nightscape mode.The Nord has a tough time when it comes to specs, because no matter how good it is, the phone will always pale in comparison to the iPhone SE. There's nothing wrong with the Snapdragon 765G chip inside OnePlus' handset, particularly paired with the maximum 12GB RAM (8GB on the base model). But the A13 chip inside the budget iPhone is a flagship-level piece of silicon that can beat even the Snapdragon 865 chipset that sits one whole tier above the Nord's silicon in Qualcomm's pecking order.In the all-round Geekbench 5 test, the Nord scored 602 on the single core trial and 1948 on the multicore one. The iPhone SE achieved 1,337 for single core and 3,226 for multicore, marking the Nord's inevitable defeat to the A13 chip.In 3DMark’s Sling Shot OpenGL graphics benchmark, the Nord scored 4,521. That's much better than the Pixel 3a's 1,602, but it's an unfair comparison since Google’s phone is over a year old and uses a Snapdragon 6-series chipset, the next level down from the 7-series system-on-chip in the Nord. It will be interesting to see how the Nord fares against the Pixel 4a, but that phone has yet to emerge from Google's stable.When it comes to storage space, OnePlus has been quite generous yet again. The cheapest Nord comes with 128GB of capacity, while the more expensive version gets 256GB. The Pixel 3a and iPhone SE only offer 64GB by default, with their initially attractive prices going steadily higher if you want similar storage space to the Nord.It's briefly worth mentioning here the speakers built into the Nord. They produce sound at a decently high volume, even though listening to Tyler, the Creator's album Igor revealed they’re a bit treble heavy. More notably, the speakers don’t fire in stereo, unlike the iPhone SE’s. It's one of the few premium features that OnePlus hasn't tried to squeeze into the Nord. It's a weakness, but not one that should bother potential buyers too much.The Snapdragon 765G chip gives the Nord compatibility with the common sub-6Ghz 5G networks found in the U.K. and most of the U.S. However, there's no sign of millimeter-wave (mmWave) support, meaning this won't be a good choice if you're a Verizon 5G customer in the US.OnePlus does offer a unique OnePlus 8 handset that does work with mmWave though, so perhaps if the Nord ever makes it to the U.S., the company might consider adding mmWave connectivity.At 4,115 mAh, the battery in the OnePlus Nord is larger than what you'd find in some flagship phones. It's also more than twice as large as the battery in the iPhone SE; one of the most notable weaknesses of Apple's cheap handset. OnePlus phones have tended to perform slightly above average at best when it comes to battery life, so the Nord is already in a good place.We used a modified version of our custom battery test on the Nord, letting the battery drain from full while the phone browsed the web over an LTE data connection until it ran out of power. With the screen's brightness set to 50%, and the display refresh rate set to its basic 60Hz, the Nord lasted 11 hours and 18 minutes before it ran out of juice. (Normally, in our tests, we set the screen to 150 nits of brightness, so this isn't an official result.)Bear in mind that you won't get as long a run time if you put the Nord's display on its maximum 90Hz refresh rate, but this is a very good result. It beats the OnePlus 8 (11:04) and OnePlus 8 Pro (11:05), which would ordinarily land it a spot on our best phone battery life list.Keep in mind that we can't directly compare this score with our other battery life tests until we get the Nord to our proper testing lab for verification. However, since the Pixel 3a managed 11 hours and 59 minutes on the official test, and iPhone SE managed 9 hours and 18 minutes, it's safe to say that the OnePlus Nord is quite efficient overall.Charging up the Nord again once it's empty doesn't take long. The phone comes with the same Warp Charge 30T block that OnePlus also throws in the box for the OnePlus 8 series. While not the fastest charging tech around, the charger still delivers power quickly. OnePlus estimates you can get to 70% full from empty in 30 minutes of charging; in our own testing we got the Nord to 68% full in the same time.There's no wireless charging option on the Nord, a lacking feature it shares with the Google Pixel 3a. The iPhone SE does have wireless charging though, thanks to its borrowed iPhone 8 body. While wireless charging can be convenient, and will only become more common in cheap phones in the next few years, I don't miss it on the Nord, particularly since it uses the incredibly common USB-C connector, which you should be able to find anywhere you go.If you're concerned about keeping your battery in tip-top condition for as long as possible, then you'll be pleased with the Nord's optimized charging feature. After learning what times of the day you tend to charge your phone (e.g. overnight while you sleep), the Nord will then limit the phone's total charge to 80% during most of its time plugged in, reducing the strain on the battery. It will then only charge the last 20% just before you're due to unplug the phone, meaning the battery spends less time at the more stressful higher percentages, keeping it in better health for longer.I'm so happy to see OxygenOS 10.5 appear on the Nord, as it's an excellent take on Android 10. It's attractive to look at and navigate through, and only has a few pre-installed apps taking up space in storage. The animated wallpaper and the way apps pop in and out of focus are pretty minor parts of the Nord experience, but they look great and make swiping through menus and apps really enjoyable, particularly with the 90Hz display on.There's no big special features to mention, just lots of welcome improvements to the basic Android experience. One I particularly appreciate is the ability to access the notification shade by swiping down anywhere on the display, and the app drawer by swiping upwards. With the display on the Nord being as large as it is, users with small hands may have found it tricky to use the phone normally without having to constantly adjust their grip. This single optimization makes the Nord so much easier to use, almost rivaling the naturally compact interfaces of the iPhone SE or Pixel 3a.OnePlus has given the Nord the usual Android unlock method of a sub-display fingerprint sensor, which is a nice touch since it likely would have been cheaper to mount the fingerprint reader on the back of the phone instead. You can also use 2D facial recognition in tandem with this. It's less secure than using your fingerprint and thus only an option for unlocking the device, but it is a nice addition. I had no problem with reliability or speed either, as it unlocks just as quickly as the Face ID on my iPhone 11 Pro does.The Nord isn't meant to be a flagship phone, but it offers enough of a premium experience that it’s as enjoyable to use as a much more expensive device. Sure, I wish OnePlus would rethink some of its camera choices, and it’d be nice if the chipset offered a bit more muscle. But I'd still recommend this to anyone looking for an Android device —  particularly those who take a look at the thousand-dollar prices of flagship Androids and cringe in fear.The Nord easily dispatches the Pixel 3a, but you're unlikely to be considering the 3a if you're looking to buy a phone right now, given that it was recently dropped by Google and is on the cusp of being replaced. The Pixel 4a — if and when Google finally releases that rumored phone — will be the Nord's biggest challenger. It's rumored to be cheaper than even the well-priced OnePlus phone, will likely have excellent photography based on Google's previous Pixels and will offer a similar high-quality Android experience. For the time being though, the OnePlus Nord is easily the best inexpensive Android phone you can buy. That just leaves the matter of the iPhone SE. Some users are just going to prefer Apple or Google's interfaces, no matter what the hardware offers, so it's hard to really call one better than the other. But say you're platform agnostic. If hardware quality is even a small priority for you, then given OnePlus' awesome display, excellent battery life and more versatile cameras, I don't think the iPhone SE's wireless charging or superior chipset makes it worth passing up the chance to own a Nord."
96,Hot Pepper Ghost,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/hot-pepper-ghost,"Price: $199 OS: Android 9 Pie Display: 6-inch LCD (1440x720) CPU: MediaTek Helio P22 RAM: 3GB, 4GB Storage: 32GB, 64GB; expandable Rear camera: 13MP Front camera: 5MP Battery: 3,850 mAh Size: 6.42 x 3.06 x 0.37 inches Weight: 5.64 ouncesIt’s easy to forget how far cheap phones have come in the last several years. Today, we’re fortunate enough to have budget handsets with multi-camera modules, full-screen designs, in-display fingerprint sensors, respectable performance and long battery life available for a lot less than $300.However, if you need a painful reminder of how good we have it, I wholeheartedly recommend the $199 Hot Pepper Ghost. Because I reckon that once you’ve spent a few minutes with this handset, you’ll never take the best cheap phones for granted ever again.The puzzingly-named Ghost feels like a relic from 2017 at the absolute latest, between its boxy, thick design, enormous bezels, chintzy plastics, weak chipset, disappointing camera and low-resolution display. There’s nothing glamorous or desirable about it. And even though the Ghost is indeed inexpensive, it’s hard to argue why anyone should buy one when much more attractive options exist for the same amount of scratch.The Hot Pepper Ghost costs $199 unlocked from Hot Pepper Mobile’s website, or $179 through the Visible wireless service. Interestingly, the Visible model comes with 4GB to the pricier version’s 3GB, and double the storage — 64GB, compared to 32GB in the unlocked variant. Both configurations pack microSD slots for up to 2TB of expandable storage. For this review, we’re using the 4GB/64GB Visible-exclusive iteration.Long battery life: The Hot Pepper Ghost’s only legitimate advantage is how long it lasts on a charge. The phone’s 3,850-mAh battery isn’t the largest in the world, but it’s more than enough juice for a low-power chipset like the Helio P22. And so, the Ghost will last you a while between plugging in.In Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where phones endlessly load webpages over an LTE connection while set to 150 nits of screen brightness, the Ghost lasted an average of 12 hours and 47 minutes across two tests. That’s exactly 30 minutes longer than the Moto G Fast, and 48 minutes longer than the Google Pixel 3a.Just don’t expect the Hot Pepper Ghost to charge quickly. The Ghost comes with a measly 5-watt charger, meaning getting from empty to 100% will take an eternity. Case in point: in a half hour, the phone only reached 29% in our testing while connected to the stock adapter.Support for all carriers: It’s rare to find a cheap unlocked phone equipped to run on both GSM-based networks, like AT&T and T-Mobile, as well as CDMA ones, like Verizon and Sprint. The Hot Pepper Ghost is one of them, meaning you can take this device to virtually any carrier, from those major service providers to a discount alternative like Metro by T-Mobile, Cricket or Mint Mobile. And as we noted, the phone is available through Visible, which uses the network of parent company Verizon.What design? It’s hard to talk about the design of the Hot Pepper Ghost, because the phone really doesn’t have any. This is about the most generic-looking smartphone I’ve laid eyes on in recent years, as a consequence of its excessive bezels and glossy navy plastic cladding all around.Sure, handsets this cheap rarely look distinctive, but at least HMD Global’s Nokia devices are able to surprise with unique textures and bold colors. The Hot Pepper Ghost could have come from any one of a number of budget phone makers — from Alcatel to ZTE — and three or four years ago, and it would’ve looked right at home.I’ll hand it to Hot Pepper Mobile for fitting the Ghost with a headphone jack and capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back, as well as a USB Type-C port for charging. Given how cheap this phone feels (and, well, is), I would’ve expected a Micro USB port. Thus, the inclusion of USB-C is at least one positive giveaway that this phone actually released in this decade.The Ghost also feels like a big phone. That’s because even though the screen technically measures just 6 inches from corner to corner, it’s got an 18:9 aspect ratio, plus there are those gigantic bezels to consider. As a result, you’re not really getting a whole lot of screen real estate despite the device’s footprint.Anemic performance: Armed with MediaTek’s Helio P22 chipset and either 3GB or 4GB of RAM depending on where you buy the phone, the Hot Pepper Ghost is not a swift or even serviceably fast phone. Swiping through home screen pages to the Google feed is often marked with a palpable delay, and scrolling up and down webpages feels stilted as the device is forced to reload portions of websites multiple times to make up for what it can’t store in memory.The benchmarks tell you precisely how little the Ghost is working with. In the system-wide Geekbench 5 performance test, Hot Pepper’s device notched a multicore score of 834 points — nearly 600 points fewer than the $200 Moto G Fast. And the less said about the Ghost’s graphics performance, the better: it achieved just 461 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL test, to the Moto G Fast’s 1,119. That’s nearly a third as quick, and remember — if you’re buying unlocked, these two phones cost exactly the same.Dreary display: The Hot Pepper Ghost’s 6-inch, 1440x720 resolution LCD panel isn’t sharp, nor colorful, nor bright. Stretching 720p content over a screen this large inevitably leads to blurry videos, apps and games, and the panel’s poor viewing angles result in slight color casts and a reduction in luminosity as you shift the phone around in your hand.Watching the trailer for No Time To Die on the Ghost, there was nothing I could do to overcome the screen’s washed out colors and muddy details marred by artifacts, even on the highest resolution option. While the phone’s Delta-E color accuracy score was respectable, at 0.27 (numbers closer to zero are more accurate), it topped out at a pitiful 87.6% of the sRGB color space, indicating muted hues.The Ghost’s display couldn’t even crack 400 nits of full-screen brightness in our testing, reaching its limit at 395 nits under our light meter — making on-screen content hard to read on a sunny day.Lackluster camera: You never expect phenomenal photography from a $200 smartphone, and yet, even here, the Hot Pepper Ghost falls short.At least the spec sheet tempers your expectations. The Ghost has a 13-megapixel lens on the back — and that’s it. No ultrawide shooter or macro optic on this puppy; one camera is all you’re getting. On the front, there’s a 5-MP camera for selfies for your troubles.Now, I’m hardly a proponent of elaborate multi-lens arrays, especially on cheap phones. But in the Ghost’s case, this isn’t emblematic of a focus on quality over quantity. Hot Pepper Mobile evidently didn’t spend much time refining its imaging hardware, which becomes painfully obvious when you start snapping away. (It’s also obvious in the camera software, as you’re asked “Are you sure to delete it?” every time you want to get rid of a picture.)Take, for example, these shots of my backyard, captured with the Ghost and Moto G Fast. It’s true that the Motorola handset’s result is a bit bland and washed out, though at least it looks as if it was captured in nature, on this planet. The Ghost ratcheted the saturation and contrast up to absurd heights, producing an image that seems unintentionally gritty and dramatic — hilariously at odds with the fact that, again, this is a backyard we’re looking at, not Chernobyl.The obnoxiously punchy color is an issue that repeatedly popped up in testing the Ghost. Behold the way the phone’s camera boosts the red in the flower in the foreground to such a degree that you lose the ability to make out the texture of the petals. The leaves below are also shrouded in darkness as a result.I pulled in even closer with the Ghost’s lens on another orange flower, where, this time, the device inexplicably decided the color temperature needed to slant overly cool. The Nokia C2 Tava — a device which costs $109 from Cricket — produced a much more balanced result, with everything properly in focus and less eye-searing contrast. The Ghost’s rendition would have you believe I snapped these photos at 8 p.m., but I promise you, it was noon.Outdated software: Much like the Hot Pepper Ghost’s exterior, the software that powers this device is woefully outdated. The Ghost launches with Android 9 Pie onboard, and though it’s an admittedly light installation with zero bloat or unnecessary software, the OS is already a year behind at the device’s launch. And that doesn’t instill confidence that Hot Pepper will supply this device with new software, features or security patches in a timely manner.Now, you might think that’s an unfair ask given how cheap the Ghost is, but remember: all of HMD Global’s Nokia-branded handsets feature Android One software for near-seamless updates and all of Google’s latest and greatest features optimized for low-power handsets. Android One phones are guaranteed to receive two years of software upgrades. The Ghost is slated to get at least one, but it’ll be little consolation if owners get Android 10 only after the rest of the Android world has moved onto Android 11.No $200 smartphone is going to be perfect, but even with that cynical bit of advice fresh in your mind, the Hot Pepper Ghost is nowhere near good enough. For what you’d spend here, the Moto G Fast is several orders of magnitude better in just about every respect, and it also costs $199 unlocked. The Nokia 4.2 isn’t an excellent cheap phone, but it’s still much better than the Ghost, and it starts at just $189.If you can part with another $50, the Moto G Power remains our bona fide budget phone recommendation, as it pairs the Moto G Fast’s solid performance with the best battery life we’ve ever observed from any phone, at any price.No matter how little you have to spend on a smartphone, everyone deserves better than the Hot Pepper Ghost. Three or four years ago, you would have had to accept that and buy it anyway. Today, there’s no need to settle."
97,Moto E (2020),Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/moto-e-2020,"In many ways, the Moto E 2020 is at the heart of Motorola's approach to smartphones. This 7th generation of Motorola's entry level handset is Motorola's latest attempt to give budget phone buyers a low-cost option that still delivers on the key basics.Price: $149 Screen size: 6.4-inch LCD (1520x720) CPU: Snapdragon 632 RAM: 2GB Storage: 32GB microSD: Yes, up to 512GB Rear cameras: 13MP main (f/2.0); 2MP depth sensor (f/2.2) Front camera: 5MP (f/2.0) Battery size: 3,550 mAh Battery life (Hrs:Mins): 10:14 Size: 6.3 x 3 x 0.34 inches Weight: 6.5 ounces Color: Midnight BlueBut a lot has happened since last year's Moto E6. In that time, Motorola has dabbled with the foldable Motorola Razr, introduced a series of speciality phones with the different Moto One models and even gotten back into the flagship game with the Motorola Edge Plus. You have to wonder if Motorola's focus is on something other than the Moto E lineup, especially at a time when the low-cost Moto G lineup has produced the long-last Moto G Power, the intriguing Moto G Stylus and now the Moto G Fast.With Moto G phones ranging in price from $199 to $299, you have to wonder if there's still any room for the Moto E among the best cheap phones. Our Moto E review has found a capable budget device that will appeal to anyone who hates to spend more than $200 on a smartphone. But there's nothing about the Moto E that stands out, especially when a few dollars more will get you a better phone in the form of the Moto G Power.The Moto E costs $149 and goes on sale June 12. The Moto E is $50 cheaper than the Moto G Fast, which offers features a faster processor, additional cameras and longer battery life. The Moto E is also $100 cheaper than the $249 Moto G Power and $150 less than the $299 Moto G Stylus.Pre-orders are already underway for the Moto E, which hits stores unlocked on June 12 at Best Buy, B&H Photo, Walmart, Amazon and Motorola's own website. Carriers offering the Moto E will include T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Boost Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Consumer Cellular, Xfinity Mobile and Republic Wireless. Verizon will also offer the Moto E through its prepaid service.You're not going to fool anyone into thinking you've paid more than $150 for your phone with the Moto E. It's not that the phone looks unattractive, but the plastic materials, blocky edges and overall appearance confirms that it’s a budget phone.Even though the Moto E uses a teardrop notch to house its front camera, there's still a noticeable bezel at the top and along the sides of the phone. There's a pretty thick bezel along the bottom, too — not iPhone SE-thick but prominent enough to stand out even among budget phones sporting more expansive displays.At 6.3 x 3 x 0.34 inches, the Moto E isn't that much taller and wider than comparable phones. It's roughly the same size as the 6.4 x 3 x 0.33 inches and noticeably thinner than the Moto G Power, which has to accommodate a much bigger battery. While the Moto E felt weighty in my hand, the 6.5 ounce phone is only 0.2 ounces lighter than the TCL 10L, which struck me as a fairly light handset.The Moto E's 6.2-inch HD+ display is a bit of a disappointment, and not because it's a LCD panel. That's the trade-off you make with cheaper phones. Instead, my problem with the display is that it's not very colorful or bright. Watching the trailer for 1917 via YouTube, I could make out George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman trudging their way across No Man's Land in broad daylight, but anytime the scene shifted indoors, details were lost in the shadows. I noticed the same effect with Raiders of the Lost Ark on Netflix, where Marian's bar in Nepal was an indistinct shadow. Viewing angles are non-existent so be prepared to watch videos head-on.Test numbers from our lab back up my experience. The Moto E display captured 100.6% off the sRGB color spectrum. The TCL 10L, which puts more of a premium on the display, was more colorful at 122.1%. You'll also get more accurate colors with the TCL phone, as its Delta-E rating was 0.22 to 0.39 for the Moto E. (Numbers closer to zero are more accurate.)The Moto E's screen problems are compounded by the fact that the display just isn't very bright. We measured a peak brightness of 388 nits with a light meter. That's below the 500 and 501 nit measurements we got with the Moto G Power and Moto G Stylus, respectively. You'll definitely have trouble making out the screen when you're outside on a sunny day.Lower-cost phones have made a habit of adding extra lenses as of late, so in a sense, the Moto E feels decidedly old-school. There's a 13-megapixel main shooter with an f/2.0 aperture, augmented by a 2MP depth sensor for better portrait shots. That hardware produces pretty competent photos, though the Moto E can struggle with lighting.Take this photo of the big honkin' burrito I ate for lunch while testing the Moto E. The shot captured by the Moto E does a decent job recreating the colorful sauce topping the burrito, and you can even make out some of the beans and meat that make up the filling. But the light streaming in from a nearby window causes serious overexposure problems in the upper third of the photo. That didn’t happen with a shot I took with the TCL 10L.Similarly, the Moto E also struggles when the lights are low, as we can see in a dimly-lit nighttime photograph of a cocktail perched on a bookshelf. The glass containing my Rusty Nail blends into the background, and the titles of some of the cookbooks appear fuzzy and out of focus, as if the Moto E's aperture struggled to let in enough ambient light. The outline of the cocktail glass is much more distinctive in the TCL 10L's shot, and the text on the book covers is sharper, too.Outside in bright sunshine, though, the Moto E fares much better. It accurately recreates the blue sky surrounding a movie theater marquee and it even manages to capture the details of the cinema's facade. The TCL 10L photo is much darker for some reason, with even the movie theater sign looking shadowy. The Moto E's depth sensor really helps the budget phone shine when it comes to portrait photos. While the blur effect isn't in evidence on the left background of the Moto E's shot, my daughter really pops out of the frame, with the depth sensor handling her hair with ease. That same hair flummoxed the TCL 10L, which applied its blur effect to the edges of her hair on both the right and left side of her face. The Moto E's portrait shot is something you'd expect from a much more expensive phone.Up front, the Moto features a 5MP selfie cam that's more than capable of producing decent self-portraits. There's really no differentiating the Moto E's shot from what the TCL 10L captured with its 16MP front camera, though I think the Moto E did a better job handling the sunlight breaking through the orange tree around me. Like many phones, the Moto E is a little too aggressive with smoothing out my face, but you can turn off the camera's beauty mode if you prefer.With a Snapdragon 632 system-on-chip running the show, no one's going to mistake the Moto E for a performance powerhouse. And the 2GB of RAM included on the phone won't really help you jump from app to app with relative ease.Unfortunately, we can't really tell you how the Moto E compares to other phones, as the phone can't currently install the Geekbench 5 test for measuring general performance. We were able to run 3DMark's Sling Shot Open GL test to measure graphics performance, however, and the results don't put the Moto in a flattering light. The Moto turned in a score of 949, which was well behind the results of the Moto G Power (1,734), Moto G Fast (1,769) and TCL 10L (1,747). Those three phones all use a Snapdragon 665 chipset, which is certainly a decent piece of silicon but not something that's going to blow away other handsets.I saw that performance gap first-hand when using the Moto E. PUBG Mobile ran on this budget handset, but with noticeable hiccups and dropped frames. The graphics weren't particularly well rendered either. PUBG is a demanding game, but I didn't run into these problems when testing the Moto G Power or TCL 10L. I also noticed slight lag when switching between apps on the Moto E. Essentially, it's a phone that can handle basic tasks, but forget about running graphically intense games or anything that requires a lot of processing power.The Moto E makes a better showing when it comes to battery life, as the phone made the most of its comparatively modest 3,350 mAh power pack. That allowed the Moto E to hold out for 10 hours and 14 minutes on our battery test, in which we have phones surf the web continuously over T-Mobile's LTE network until they run out of power.By topping the 10 hour mark, the Moto E finishes slightly ahead of the average time for smartphones. Still, it's no match for other recent Motorola handsets, which benefit from bigger batteries. The Moto G Stylus and its 4,000 mAh lasted 12 hours and 14 minutes, while the Moto G Power used a massive 5,000 mAh battery to endure for more than 16 hours. Those phones only cost $100 to $150 more than the Moto E and made our best phone battery life list.Don't expect a quick recharge for the Moto E. After half-an-hour of recharging the drained phone with the included charger, the Moto E was only up to 18%. That's well off the pace set by the Moto G Stylus (29%), which is hardly a speed demon when it comes to recharging.The Moto E runs Android 10, the latest version of Google's mobile OS. And that's all it may ever run, as Motorola told us it has no plans to do software updates beyond security updates for the phone. That's how it is for low-cost Android phones, but it's still something you should be aware of when deciding which phone to get.Otherwise, the Moto E features Motorola's usually light hand with Android, in which the software experience is pretty close to what you'd get with the stock OS. The few tweaks that Motorola makes are helpful Moto actions such as turning on the phone's flashlight by making two quick chopping motions or placing three fingers on the display to take a screenshot. My favorite Moto Action — launching the camera with a twist of the wrist — doesn't appear to be supported here.The Moto E's fingerprint reader is easy to set up, and the sensor's location on the back of the phone, well away from the camera lenses, is easy to find. I never had any problem unlocking the Moto E, and it's good to see a polished security feature on such an inexpensive phone.If you don't want to spend that much money on your next phone, our Moto E review confirms that this latest Motorola release is a capable low-cost option. Just be prepared for lackluster performance and a display that doesn't wow — compromises that budget phone buyers are willing to make all the time.The problem is, you really don't have to make these sacrifices if you're willing to pay a bit more, and you can still buy a Motorola phone in the process. The Moto G Fast and Moto G Power are both better phones than the Moto E, offering better performance, longer battery life (much longer in the Power's case) and better bang for the buck. They also cost only $50 to $100 more depending on the model.Still, in this economy, even paying a little extra is a big ask. In that sense then, the Moto E will satisfy people who've stretched their dollars just about as far as they can go. At least they'll get decent battery life and much better cameras than a budget phone usually delivers with the Moto E."
98,Moto G Fast,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/moto-g-fast,"Another month, another cheap Motorola smartphone — at least that’s how it seems these days, given that it was only in May that the company launched the Moto G Power and Moto G Stylus. Now, a third member is joining the Moto G family, called the Moto G Fast.However the name may come off, the Moto G Fast is not a performance-focused patch on those existing models. It has the same processor as those other variants, but 3GB of RAM to their 4GB, half the internal storage, a lower-resolution display and a smaller battery than the epically-long-lasting Moto G Power. Because of these concessions, it costs just $199 — $50 less than the Power, and $100 less than the Stylus.Starting price: $199 Display: 6.4-inch LCD (1560x720) CPU: Snapdragon 665 Storage: 32GB; expandable up to 512GB RAM: 3GB Battery: 4,000 mAh Rear camera: 16MP main (ƒ/1.7); 8MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2); 2MP macro (ƒ/2.2) Front camera: 8MP (ƒ/2.0) Colors: Pearl White Weight: 6.68 ounces Dimensions: 6.37 x 2.98 x 0.35 inches So, as it turns out, the Moto G Fast is actually the entry-level Moto G — and quite a good place to start, at that. Prospective buyers with an extra $50 to burn shouldn’t think twice about upgrading to the Moto G Power for its never-ending longevity on a charge, and the performance benefits offered by that extra gigabyte of RAM. But based on our Moto G Fast review, this isn’t a bad alternative for a fair discount.The Moto G Fast arrives June 12 for $199 unlocked and works on both GSM and CDMA networks. At launch, the only carrier offering it will be Boost Mobile, though the unlocked version will be widely available from retailers like Amazon. There’s one configuration, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage (expandable by another 512GB through the use of a microSD card), and it’s sold exclusively in Pearl White.For reference, the Moto G Power costs $50 more, has a 5,000-mAh battery to the Moto G Fast’s 4,000-mAh unit, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The $299 Moto G Stylus adds upgraded main and ultrawide cameras above both less-expensive Moto G models, but carries the same size battery as the Moto G Fast. (Oh, and in case it’s not clear from the name, it comes with a stylus, too.) Both pricier Moto G handsets also have full-HD displays, compared to the standard HD one inside the Moto G Fast.The display: The 6.4-inch, HD LCD display on the Moto G Fast is by no means the nicest or prettiest smartphone screen you’ll ever lay eyes on, but it’s bright, it’s big and it gets the job done.Let’s start with the brightness. At a peak of 443 nits, the Moto G Fast’s screen won’t crack the 800-nit threshold of some flagship smartphones. Nevertheless, it’s better than what you often get from most devices this cheap. Even the Pixel 3a tops out at 401 nits, and that handset costs twice as much as the Moto G Fast.The brightness of the display ensures you’ll be able to see the screen reasonably well outdoors on a sunny day. But when you want to take in a movie or game, the Moto G Fast delivers a balanced and natural color palette that stays comfortably within the sRGB range, even when tuned to its most eye-popping Saturated mode.The Moto G Fast covered 97% of the sRGB color space according to our light meter, which is actually quite low compared to most smartphones we review. Even the $179 Nokia 4.2 achieved 153.2% in the same test. That said, I wasn’t wanting for punchier hues when I watched the trailer for Bill & Ted Face the Music; the flashes of electricity enveloping the titular heroes’ time-traveling phone booth looked as bodacious as ever.Rather, my gripe was with the low resolution of the Moto G Fast’s screen. At 6.4 inches, it must be stressed that this is a generously-sized panel for such an inexpensive phone, but there are simply too few pixels to fill it. Details are blurry, text and icons are jagged, and no matter what YouTube video you’re watching, you always feel like you need to bump up the resolution even though you can’t. It’s the only notable downside to an otherwise good smartphone display for the money.The battery life: No, the Moto G Fast won’t touch the 16 hour, 10 minute runtime of the Moto G Power. But it still lasts pretty long on a charge, and certainly long enough to land on our list of the best phone battery life.The Moto G Fast averaged 12 hours and 17 minutes across three sessions of Tom’s Guide’s battery test, where the device endlessly loaded web pages until it ran out of juice, while set to 150 nits of screen brightness.That’s a very strong result. The Moto G Stylus, which costs $100 more than this model, turned in 3 minutes less. The Pixel 3a just fell shy of 12 hours, at 11:59. Even the iPhone 11 Pro Max — the most expensive iPhone that Apple sells with the biggest battery — topped out at 11 hours and 54 minutes.You can forget about the $399 iPhone SE, too — that device has a diminutive 1,821-mAh battery, and so it averaged just 9 hours and 18 minutes. The $249 TCL 10L, one of the newest budget Android phones on the block, topped out at 9:59.While the efficiency of the Moto G Fast’s 4,000-mAh battery is impressive, the phone’s charge time is not. In a half hour, the stock adapter only got this device to 26% in our testing. The fastest chargers in modern handsets can often replenish 50% or more of a phone’s battery capacity in that time, but given the Moto G Fast’s price, it misses out on such luxuries. At least you won’t have to charge it very often.The performance: The Moto G Fast obviously isn’t going to dazzle you with its performance, but getting a Snapdragon 665 chip for less than $200 happens to be a pretty solid deal.Under most circumstances, this isn't a phone that feels slow. It’s responsive enough for typical tasks, and even handles demanding games well with the appropriate modifications. For example, Asphalt 9 Legends was a bit of a kludgy experience at the default graphical setting, with the frame rate probably hovering somewhere in the mid-teens. When set to Performance mode, though, the arcade racer was actually smooth enough to enjoy.Compare the Moto G Fast’s benchmarks to those of its budget contemporaries, and this phone fares quite well. It achieved a 1,394 score in the multi-core Geekbench 5 test, which beats the Pixel 3a’s result by some 60 points, and the TCL 10L by about 40. That’s not bad company to be in, especially given that the Moto G Power is launching at half the price Google’s 2019 cheap Pixel released at.Graphical performance was more underwhelming, though GPUs in budget phones don’t tend to set a high bar. The Moto G Fast’s 1,119-point result in 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL test was far exceeded by both the Moto G Power (1,704) and TCL 10 L (1,782); and you can forget about the Pixel 3a (2,543).The camera: There are three cameras on the back of the Moto G Fast, though they’re not exclusive to this device — the Moto G Power has the same combination of lenses and sensors.That’s a good thing, because my colleague Philip Michaels liked the Moto G Power’s cameras quite a bit when he tested that device last month. In both Moto phones, you’ll find a primary 16MP sensor with an ƒ/1.7 aperture, supplemented by 8MP ultrawide and 2MP macro shooters. An 8MP, ƒ/2.0 lens serves selfie duties up front.The Moto G Fast can churn out better images than its low price would suggest. Consider this example of a flower, side-by-side with the same shot through the lens of the Samsung Galaxy A51, which costs twice as much as the Motorola handset. Surprisingly, it’s the Moto G Fast that finds the right contrast and color balance here, avoiding the overdramatic edges, hard shadows and bleached highlights that plagued the Galaxy’s rendition.Both phones in this particular example made use of their AI scene optimizing features, and while Samsung’s has a reputation for overcooking things, Motorola’s is actually quite useful. I wasn’t tempted to turn it off — as I am with similar modes on any of Samsung’s devices — which may as well be an endorsement.I took another look at that flower, this time with the Moto G Fast’s macro lens. The results are fine, but hardly spectacular. First of all, the flower’s pinkish hue ends up being more of a red in this take, which isn’t true to actual conditions. Second, the device had a difficult time focusing, and it took several taps to get the macro sensor to zero in on the details. Once the lens got its bearings, the results proved fine, but the experience of shooting with it was so finicky that it’d put me off snapping macro images in the future.The Moto G Fast’s ultrawide lens is surprisingly solid, and I actually prefer its results to the Galaxy A51’s once again, for several reasons. The A51’s ultrawide optic pulls further back than the Moto G Fast’s, but there’s much more distortion at the fringes and blurring of details, like the “No Diving” sign on the pool to the right. Additionally, Samsung’s post-processing opts for cooler tones that simultaneously boost the greens in the grass and the blues in the sky above, to what I’d consider an excessive degree. Again, the Moto G Fast claims the more natural, balanced shot.Heading indoors, the Moto G Fast couldn’t pull out the same saturation and colors as the Galaxy A51 as I photographed a pair of model cars. The hues and contrast from Motorola’s handset are much more muted, but on the flip side, the Moto G Fast does a much better job of picking up those barely-perceptible details, like the tread on the tires belonging to the car in the foreground, and the logo inscribed on its yellow brake calipers.Overall, I’m really pleased with the Moto G Fast’s cameras. Sure, they’re not astonishing, and they’re easily outclassed by what you’d get from either the $399 Pixel 3a or iPhone SE — but again, this phone costs half the price of those, and it surely holds its own against the Galaxy A51. But the one aspect of the Moto G Fast’s imaging system I don’t care for is the front-facing camera.I have never taken a selfie on a Motorola phone I’ve been happy with, and that includes the company’s latest flagship, the Motorola Edge Plus. However Motorola tunes its post-processing for selfies, it turns my skin orange and plays up shadows and imperfections in a truly unflattering way. Lo and behold, that’s exactly what happened here. I don’t take a whole lot of selfies, but if I owned a Moto G Fast, I probably wouldn’t take any, ever. The design: The Moto G Fast isn’t a bad looking smartphone — just a cheap one. Shrouded in glossy plastic and encircled with fake chrome, the Moto G Fast is pretty much your standard budget phone in terms of design, with an aesthetic that apes those of pricier devices, albeit with lower-quality materials.The hole-punch cutout for the front-facing camera has allowed Motorola to extend the display as high up as possible, but the bottom bezel is several times thicker than those on the other three sides of the panel, which creates an awkward, unbalanced look.Thankfully, there’s a headphone jack up top for your troubles, and an old-school, rear-facing capacitive fingerprint sensor for authentication. The latter is a nice touch I’ve missed from more recent phones; in-display sensors just aren’t as effortless, accurate and fast yet. In this case, the classic approach is simply better.The software update situation: The Moto G Fast launches with Android 10 and Motorola’s light additions to Google’s mobile operating system. That includes the company’s iconic shortcuts, like twisting to launch the camera and chopping to activate the flashlight, as well as the Peek Display mode, which elegantly presents notifications in a glanceable way on a black screen when the phone is otherwise sleeping.Motorola’s software is largely fine; this is Android as you know and love it, with some improvements. There’s even a rudimentary theming engine, very similar to what Google introduced with the latest Pixel phones, that offers a slight degree of customization. The problem with the software, however, is one familiar to Motorola phones: updates.Motorola has told us the Moto G Fast will eventually receive an update to Android 11, but the company isn’t committing to any sort of schedule. The attitude appears to be more of “we’ll get to it when we get to it,” which isn’t particularly surprising; this is a cheap phone after all, and cheap phones that aren’t made by Google or Apple tend to get the shaft when it comes to long-term support.Given that Motorola originally promised just one update for the $999 Edge Plus, then quickly doubled back and promised two years of support in the face of widespread criticism, we expect that Android 11 is the furthest the Moto G Fast will go.These days, there’s no shortage of cheap phones in the $200 to $400 range all claiming to deliver premium features at reasonable prices. The Moto G Fast doesn’t feel like a high-end phone though — it’s a modest device that achieves what it sets out to — nothing more, nothing less.If $200 is the absolute most you can afford to spend on a new smartphone, this is the one to buy. The $149 Moto E is the next cheapest device in Motorola’s arsenal, but that one makes too many concessions to offer a user experience that is consistent or in any way desirable. The Moto G Fast is a far superior phone.The question then is, can you spend a little more? Because, if so, the Moto G Power is a no-brainer for $249. It lasts astonishingly long on a charge, has an extra gigabyte of RAM for better performance when multitasking, comes with double the storage out of the box and has a nicer display, all for $50 more than the Moto G Fast. The Power is the Goldilocks choice of Motorola's budget range. But if it’s too steep for you, the Moto G Fast should do just fine."
99,RedMagic 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/redmagic-5g-review,"One look at the RedMagic 5G’s striking looks and unique features, and it’s clear this isn’t a gaming phone you can easily ignore. What you also shouldn't ignore is what this supposedly specialized phone can offer you as an average smartphone user looking for your next flagship device.Gaming phones are still a niche within the wider smartphone market, but they can benefit more than just Fortnite fans and the like. With their large displays, powerful chipsets and endless customizability, they also tick boxes that are relevant to more mainstream customers. While the RedMagic 5G isn't a luxurious device made with premium materials or meticulously-designed software, it will do what you need it to do, whether that’s work or play, with power to spare. It even delivers a few class-leading features, like its super-smooth 144Hz display and in-built cooling fan.An unfortunate fact of the smartphone market is that to get a lot of power, you typically need to pay out. Phones that break this trend, like the iPhone SE 2020, are rare values, and our RedMagic 5G review found a handset that is appealing for similar reasons. This is a phone that might just make you reconsider why anyone would pay so much for similar offerings from Samsung or OnePlus. And while it’s not a perfect replacement for those brands’ flagships by any stretch, it is a worthy alternative that ranks among the best Android phones you can buy today. Starting price: $579/£539 Display (resolution): 6.65-inch FHD+ AMOLED, up to 144Hz (2340 x 1080) CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 RAM: 8GB/12GB Storage: 128GB/256GB MicroSD?: No Rear Cameras: 64MP main, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro Front Camera: 8MP Water resistance: Not rated Battery size: 4,500 mAh Charging: 18W, up to 55W Size: 168 x 78 x 9.75mm (6.6 x 3.07 x 0.38 inches) Weight: 218g (7.68 ounces) Colors: Red/Blue, Red, Black The only place to get a RedMagic 5G is from the RedMagic website itself, but it ships to both the U.S. and the U.K.. The basic model, available either in Hot Rod Red or Eclipse Black, has 8GB RAM and 128GB of storage for $579/£539. It will cost $649/£599 for the more expensive version, which only comes in the red/blue Pulse color combination, but offers 12GB RAM and 256GB storage instead.The Eclipse Black and Pulse versions are both currently available for purchase, while Hot Rod Red is still “coming soon” according to RedMagic’s website, with no date given for its release. It's unlikely to be controversial to say the outer casing of the 5G is very loud. This color option, officially called Pulse, is perhaps the most striking color combination I've seen on a phone in a long time. Whether that's a good thing will depend on your personal preference, but its dual colors and shiny glass back are pretty much the antithesis of the subtle metallic tones that most premium smartphone manufacturers go for. If this color combo is too much for you, there are all-black or all-red options available, but only with the lesser of the two available specs configurations. On the back, there's the prerequisite RGB lighting, but it's fairly subtle. It’s constrained only to the transparent RedMagic logotype and in the center of the phone and the company logo in the bottom center, and you can turn it off if you find it annoying. If you leave it on, though, it can act as an alert light to tell you when you've got a notification.Around the edges you find the usual power button and volume buttons on the right side, and the SIM tray and USB-C port on the bottom. But also on the right, you'll see the RedMagic 5G's two capacitive trigger buttons for gaming, and one of two openings for the built-in cooling fan (the other being on the left side next to the Game Boost switch and the external peripheral connector). A final small treat can be found on the top: a headphone jack, much to the relief of anyone who's yet to invest in a pair of the best wireless headphones. The front is the weakest part of the phone's overall image. The top and bottom bezels are particularly large, making the phone look a few generations out of date. However, that means there's no notch breaking up the display, which is exactly what you don't want when gaming.A design factor that may also affect some people is the phone's size and weight. This is one of the largest and heaviest phones we've tested this year, measuring almost the same in length, width and height as the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra while weighing more. You'll need big pockets to carry the RedMagic around, and a tolerance for that 218g (7.68 ounces) mass every time you pick it up to use it. The RedMagic 5G's display is only interested in one thing – maximum frame rate. That's why this 6.65-inch AMOLED panel bears the title of first production phone with a 144Hz display, a cut above the 120Hz refresh rate that became commonplace for Android flagships this year. It's noticeable too, as swiping through menus or watching content on RedMagic’s phone looks a touch smoother than on the 120Hz panel of the OnePlus 8 Pro.What you gain in extra frames, you lose elsewhere though. The RedMagic 5G’s display is only FHD rather than the flagship-standard QHD, and it's bordered at the top and bottom by heavy bezels in order to avoid spoiling the view with a camera notch. There are no curved edges either, like you'd find on the OnePlus 8 Pro or Huawei P40 Pro, but I don't really miss them. The display is also a little dim. It's rated at a maximum of 600 nits, but  peaked at only 429 nits in our testing. That's a long way off the 847-nit rating of the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus. I was able to use the RedMagic 5G outdoors without a problem, but perhaps you should avoid using it in direct sunlight if you want to make sure you don't miss out on anything happening on screen.We also tested the phone's panel for color quality, finding that it achieves 180% of the sRGB color gamut, 128% of the trickier DCI-P3 color gamut and a color accuracy score (Delta-E) of 0.30. That's a step above the OnePlus 8 Pro's scores of 165% and 117%, respectively, but RedMagic’s device loses out on color accuracy, beaten by the OnePlus' 0.26 rating. (Zero is a perfect score.)Watching JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders on the 5G was a mixed quality experience. I liked the way the phone made the bright colors of this vividly-inked anime pop out, however the FHD resolution was not as clear as rival QHD displays, as you would expect. The worst aspect were the speakers, which are a little underpowered despite this being a stereo setup. Fortunately, this is easy to ignore once you put on a pair of headphones, which is easy to do since there's still a headphone jack to plug into.Gaming phones aren't focussing on the quality of pictures you can take with them, but they're still important to most phone users. RedMagic hasn't completely skimped on sensors either, since the RedMagic 5G offers a very large 64-megapixel main camera, backed up with an 8-MP ultrawide camera and 2-MP macro camera, alongside an 8-MP front camera.The following comparisons are made against the OnePlus 8 Pro, which isn't ranked as our best camera phone of the moment. For Android devices, that distinction actually goes to the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus. Yet OnePlus’ flagship costs closer to the RedMagic 5G, and takes decent enough pictures to serve as a suitable benchmark. Testing the two main cameras first during a trip to a local beach, the RedMagic gets off to a good start with its 64MP resolution beating the 48MP resolution of the OnePlus. I can't pick out a strong preference here, which arguably is a condemnation of the 5G's poorer image processing letting the OnePlus close the quality gap, but this is still a good result for the RedMagic phone.But the RedMagic pulls ahead when we go in for a close-up of a starfish, washed up on the shore. The bumps and corners of the five-pointed fish look brighter and more colorful on the 5G, although the OnePlus does seem to render a slightly sharper image.When the sun goes down, the OnePlus 8 can show off its Nightscape mode, which works pretty well in illuminating this tree just after sunset. The RedMagic does have a night mode too, but it's far less effective, with the image lacking essential color and detail.Switching to the ultrawide cameras, the RedMagic's 8MP sensor struggles to compete against the OnePlus's 48MP sensor. The image from the gaming phone is significantly darker, which not only fails to accurately depict the colors of the scene but also causes the furthest parts of the background to start blending into the sky. It's a no-contest round in the OnePlus' favor.A 2-MP macro lens is the RedMagic’s final rear camera. This is a cost-effective way for phone makers to add an extra photography option to their devices, but it's incredibly hard to get a decent shot out of these tiny sensors, and this one is no exception. This image of a flower did turn out quite well, but it took me at least 10 attempts to get a picture I was happy with, and this shot likely would have turned out just as nice using the main sensor.The final test compares the 8MP front camera of the RedMagic against the OnePlus' 16MP sensor. The 5G produces an OK image, but it pales in comparison to the OnePlus 8 Pro’s, which is superior in detail, color and in creating a portrait effect for the background.The RedMagic 5G won't be getting a spot on our list of best camera phones, but rest assured it has the bases covered when it comes to selfies and standard main sensor photos, and is at least capable of ultrawide images if you don't have a better camera available. The macro sensor is still unnecessary though.In terms of its specs, the RedMagic is as good as any other recent Android flagship with its Snapdragon 865 chipset backed up by 12GB of RAM.On Geekbench 5, it achieved 899 points in the single core test and 3,243 in the multi-core test. It's still way behind the iPhone 11 Pro Max's scores of 1,334 and 3,517 respectively, as all Android phones are. It's also a little behind the OnePlus 8 Pro, which uses the same CPU and amount of RAM and scored 906 and 3,379 points, respectively.The competition tightens up on graphics. Both the OnePlus 8 Pro and the RedMagic 5G managed 20fps on the GFXBench 1440p Aztec Ruins OpenGL offscreen test, with the iPhone 11 Pro Max reaching 25 fps. This is a great achievement for a phone that costs $650, and cements the RedMagic's reputation for providing lots of bang for relatively little buck.My own general usage supported this. Playing Asphalt 9: Legends didn’t seem to tax the RedMagic 5G much, and thanks to the phone’s cooling fan, the glass back barely heated up even after a full 20 minutes of playtime. You get a fairly standard 4,500-mAh battery in the RedMagic 5G — identical in size to the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and just a little smaller than the OnePlus 8 Pro's 4,510 mAh cell. RedMagic’s phone uses that power very efficiently though. At the lowest 60Hz display refresh rate, you get 11 hours and 23 minutes, which crushes the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus' lifespan of 10 hours and 31 minutes by nearly an hour and also beats the 11 hours and 5 minutes achieved by the OnePlus 8 Pro.At the maximum 144Hz, that longevity is reduced to 8 hours and 53 minutes. That's precisely two minutes less than the Galaxy S20 Plus (8:55) and nine minutes less than the OnePlus 8 Pro (9:02), but those devices max out at 120Hz instead (and the S20 Plus was at FHD resolution instead of QHD, too), so you're getting a little extra smoothness for a little less battery life, which I think is worth the tradeoff. The RedMagic 5G comes with an 18W charger in the box, which during my own testing filled the phone up to 30% in half an hour of charge time. That's OK, though hardly impressive. However, the phone does support up to 55W charging with other charging blocks. Using a 65W laptop charger, I was able to charge the 5G up to 77% in 30 minutes, with the phone offering the option to turn on its internal fan to help manage the high temperatures caused by all that wattage. It's a pity RedMagic doesn't include a more powerful adapter in the box, but it's good to know that you can get excellent charging performance by plugging it into your laptop charger, saving you time and space in your bag. As you might have guessed from the name, the RedMagic 5G is 5G compatible thanks to the Qualcomm X55 modem that comes with the Snapdragon 865 chipset. It is only sub-6Ghz 5G though, so tough luck if your carrier’s 5G network uses mmWave.Nevertheless, if you're in the U.K., you'll be able to enjoy the speed and reliability of 5G on the RedMagic, which will prove very handy for multiplayer online gaming while out and about. U.S. customers should note, however, that the RedMagic 5G only supports 5G bands n41 and n78, which in the U.S. are exclusively used by Sprint and T-Mobile — making this device’s 5G compatibility quite slim.The 5G runs on Android 10 in the guise of RedMagic OS 3.0, which I don't find to be a particularly attractive version of Android — though it’s certainly lightweight. There is a small handful of Nubia-made apps for email, contacts, calendars, notes, photos, sound recording, clocks and alarms, file management and for fiddling with the phone's always-on display, but that's about it, aside from the standard suite of Google-made apps like Gmail and YouTube. I really don't like typing on the 5G. The default haptic feedback is too buzzy, likely because it's tuned for in-game feedback rather than for a virtual keyboard. Another sticking point is the spelling mistakes or strangely worded phrases found in various places around the menus. This would be very easy for RedMagic to fix with an OTA update, and perhaps won't be present on the units available for consumer purchase anyway. But it does leave an unpleasant impression that Nubia's not quite filed off all the rough edges.Activating Game Space by sliding the dedicated switch at the top of the phone's left edge takes you into a new interface and activates the phone's fan. Here, you can scroll through all your games (keeping them off the home screen unless you want them there), change the settings for the fan and the RGB lighting, browse in-game screenshots and clips, disable notifications to eliminate potential interruptions, set up a peripheral or controller and adjust a whole bunch of other options. Setting up a separate space for certain apps is something you can achieve on most Android phones if you know where to look in the options menu, but the Red Magic 5G puts this front and center along with several other customization options that mobile gamers are going to want quick access to. The fan itself is a first for smartphones. While it does mean that a section of the interior of the phone has to be left open to the elements (hence no IP water/dust resistance rating), it also keeps the phone cool quite effectively. At normal speed, the sound is pretty quiet, and can be covered up just by playing some audio. At full power, which you can turn on manually in Game Space, it's much louder, requiring headphones to block out the noise — and no doubt irritating anyone in the same room as you. Also part of the phone's gamer-oriented feature set are the capacitive trigger buttons on the right-hand side. Since they're not mechanical, they don't feel too out of place when you're using the phone normally. When the time comes for games, you can quickly set these up to mimic an in-game action by registering them to virtually tap a certain portion of the display, like a fire button or accelerator. You get a short blast of haptic feedback when you interact with the triggers as well, which helps these stationary buttons feel more substantial to use and quite satisfying to tap.Offering plenty of performance for a relatively low price, the RedMagic 5G is the smartphone equivalent of a tuned-up family sedan. Its loud colors, large bezels and internal fan will surely put some people off, like a particularly unsubtle spoiler and body kit mod. But if you are even just indifferent to the design, the Red Magic 5G is still worth keeping on your shortlist next time you look for a flagship-level Android phone, thanks to its sheer value.What you'll lose by buying the RedMagic 5G is a high-quality design and user experience. While this phone excels with its class-leading refresh rate and chipset/memory combination, the lower-resolution display and uninspired software can't compete with more established brands' better components and more intuitive versions of Android — although RedMagic gets a thumbs up for not going crazy with bloatware. I won't recommend the RedMagic 5G over the OnePlus 8 Pro for the majority of users, but I will happily endorse it as a potential flagship slayer for those charmed by its eccentricities, or gamers searching for a phone with an aesthetic as singular as a streak of perfectly-executed headshots in PUBG."
100,TCL 10L,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/tcl-10-l,"Price: $249 OS: Android 10 with TCL UI Display: 6.53-inch LCD (2340 x 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 665 RAM: 6GB Storage: 64GB, expandable via microSD Rear cameras: 48MP (f/1.8) main, 8MP (f/2.2) ultra wide, 2MP (f.2.4) macro, 2MP (f/2.4) depth sensor Front camera: 16MP Battery: 4,000 mAh Size: 6.4 x 3 x 0.33 inches Weight: 6.3 ouncesAfter years of making phones on behalf of other companies, TCL is building out its own smartphone lineup, and the TCL 10L is proof that budget shoppers aren't going to get lost in the shuffle. The TCL 10 Pro may have some flashier features, but the 10L sacrifices some of those in favor of a lower overall price tag.Where TCL hasn't cut corners is with the display on this budget phone. The TCL 10L features a vibrant LCD panel that rivals what you might find on more expensive phones. But is a great display enough to overcome some other areas where the TCL 10L doesn't hide its budget phone roots?Our TCL 10L review finds a solid phone for a good price that looks great but falls short in other areas where the best cheap phones have thrived.The TCL 10L is definitely the most affordable model in the TCL 10 lineup. It costs $249, which is a $200 discount off the TCL 10 Pro. That puts the L model in the same class of budget phones as the $249 Moto G Power and $299 Moto G Stylus.When the phone goes on sale May 19, you'll be able to buy the TCL 10L unlocked at Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart. The TCL 10L works with any GSM-based carrier (in other words, AT&T, T-Mobile and any discount carrier that uses their networks), but lacks support for CDMA bands.It may be a budget phone, but the TCL 10L looks pretty stylish from afar. Up close and in your hand, you'll realize this isn't a premium phone, thanks to its plastic build, but at least the back of the phone is pleasantly curvy and pleasingly glossy.Credit TCL's choice in colors, at least for the Mariana Blue model that served as my review unit. It's a deep blue with hints of purple that shimmers in the light thanks to the TCL 10L's glossy coating. (You can also get the phone in Arctic White if that's more to your liking.) That glossy back does pick up a lot of fingerprints, but that's a trade-off I'm willing to make for an inexpensive phone that still manages to make an effort to look good.Up front, you'll be staring at a 6.53-inch display that dominates the TCL 10 L's look. The phone boasts a 91% screen-to-body ratio thanks to minimal bezels on the top and bottom of the display and a cut-out for the front camera in the upper left corner. That also helps the TCL 10L squeeze its screen into a relatively slender 6.4 x 3 x 0.33-inch frame. That's a shade taller than the Moto G Power and Moto G Stylus, though not nearly as thick as those two phones.I think the thing I appreciate the most about the TCL 10L's design is just how light it is. At 6.3 ounces, it's lighter than the Moto G Stylus (6.8 ounces) and it makes the 7-ounce Moto G Power feel like a real chunker. The TCL 10L was certainly easy to tote around, even if the iPhone SE 2020 is more than an ounce lighter. But the TCL 10L can point to a 3.5mm headphone jack, something missing from Apple's recent phones.It's safe to call the TCL 10L's 6.53-inch LCD panel the centerpiece of this device. TCL is drawing on its experience as the second largest maker of TVs to bring an eye-catching display even to budget phones. Helping the TCL 10L's screen stand out is the company's Nxtvsion technology, which delivers features like SDR-to-HDR up conversion for providing brighter highlights, increased contrast and bolder colors in real time. TCL's display can adjust display brightness and color temperature so that everything's better suited to the environment around you. A Reading Mode that you can toggle on or set for specific apps delivers a paper-like display to make reading easier on the eyes. (You'll want to use this feature sparingly, as it gives everything a yellowish cast.) And TCL says its Eye Comfort Mode removes 66 percent of blue light to reduce eye strain.All of this translates to an enjoyable viewing experience, especially on a budget phone. Watching the Wonder Woman 1984 trailer, Gal Gadot's red and blue body armor sparked on the TCL 10L's screen, which faithfully recreated the 1980s neon look of that movie. I was also impressed with the bright colors in Hail Caesar's show-stopping musical number when I watched that movie on Netflix.Our lab testing confirms that the TCL 10L uses a pretty colorful LCD panel. We found that the display on TCL's budget phone captures 122.1% of the sRGB color spectrum when the TCL 10L is set to its default Vivid mode. That's a much higher percentage than the LCD panel on the Moto G Power, which only captured 97% of the sRGB spectrum. Colors are accurate on the TCL 10L, too — we measured a Delta-E rating of 0.22, compared to 0.33 for the Moto G Power and 0.32 for the Moto G Stylus. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)If I have a gripe about the TCL 10L's display, it's that the screen is not very bright. We measured a peak brightness of 422 nits with a light meter, which is a bit on the dim side. The Moto G Power hit 500 nits, while the Google Pixel 3a trailed at 401 nits. I did have to max out the TCL 10L's display brightness while taking photos on a sunny day just to see the on-screen camera controls.There's just one speaker on the TCL 10L, and it's located on the bottom of the phone. It does an adequate job, although I noticed a little bit of a hiss on the drums for The Beatles' Come Together. The bigger issue is that when you're holding the phone in landscape mode, your hand is going to cover that speaker, muffling the sound. It's something I definitely noticed when playing PUBG Mobile on the TCL 10L, which made it hard to hear approaching enemies.Even though more budget phones are sporting multiple rear cameras these days, it's still surprising when a sub-$300 phone features many cameras, especially when the iPhone SE and Pixel 3a continue to make do with one lens. It's downright shocking when you see that the TCL 10L has a four camera array fanned out in a horizontal line across its back.Besides a 48-megapixel main camera, TCL includes an 8MP ultra wide angle lens for times that you want to pull back to include more surrounding details. TCL skips a telephoto lens on the 10L — a concession found in a lot of budget phones — turning to a 2MP macro camera and 2MP depth image sensor to complete its rear camera array. The former helps you get nice and close to objects without a blurry photo being the end result while the latter helps with the TCL 10L's portrait mode.The TCL 10L's camera setup is a lot like the triple lenses you get from the Moto G Power, save for that depth image sensor which is the odd camera out on Motorola's phone. So it seemed like a fair competition to pit these $250 phones against one another to find out how the TCL phone's output measured up.The TCL 10L may pack more megapixels into its main sensor than the 16MP camera on the Moto G Power, but TCL's puts too much of a dark cast over colorful front yard decorations that a neighbor of mine put up. Yes, I shot these on a dreary, rainy day, but the Moto G Power reproduced the vibrant rainbow of colors in brighter tones. That said, the pinwheel attached to the fence is pretty blurry in the Moto's shot, while the TCL 10L did a good job of contending with the breeze to produce a steady shot.Moving inside, the TCL 10L continues to skew dark in this photo of a breakfast shot in a darkened corner of my kitchen. Here, the colors are more realistic, though, and the 10 L's shot strikes a good balance between the food on the plate and the tiki mugs in the background. The Moto G Power, trying to compensate for the lack of lighting, has given this picture a yellow cast, which overwhelms some of the details carved into the tiki mugs. You can see the pattern in the countertop of the TCL photo, but that's lost in the overly bright sheen of the Moto G Power image.I went to the shores of the San Leandro Channel to test out the ultra wide angle lens on the TCL 10L. This reference photo, shot with the main camera on both phones, again illustrates the different approaches to color. The TCL 10L's shot is much darker, so the wooden dock and boats on the lefthand side of the shot look muted. Even the Coast Guard ship in the background isn't as white as it appears in the Moto G Power shot. At least the TCL 10L's fondness for the dark side manages to capture the foreboding sky over Oakland.Busting out the wide-angle lens merely intensifies the problems with the TCL 10L's shot. Everything's still too dark, only now there's more to darken — the green plants in the foreground, as well as the additional boats docked off to the left. Even the sky, which was so striking in the standard shot, is now over-exposed. The Moto G Power's wide-angle lens took a better shot, even with my index finger dipping into the upper left corner of the shot.Neither phone has an optical zoom, but I thought I'd focus in on a bird at 3x just to see how well the digital zoom looks on the TCL 10L. And it's not bad — the seagull remains in much sharper focus in the TCL shot. This is another instance where the Moto G Power's fondness for brighter colors gets it into trouble, as the TCL 10L has the more balanced photo.I continue to be baffled as to why companies include macro lenses on their phones. It's not really a feature people have been calling out for, so far as I know, and the results routinely disappoint. Indeed, to get a usable comparison for the TCL 10L's macro lens, I had to take several shots of this rose until I found one that wasn't a hopeless blur. Even then, the macro shot taken by the Moto G Power is better focused and more richly colored. The pink rose in the TCL 10L's shot came out as more sickly orange.Up until now, it's been hard-sledding for the TCL 10L's camera array, but the depth sensor on the phone really helps out with portrait shots. The background blur in this portrait of my daughter is more comprehensive in the TCL 10L's photo, though a wisp of her hair did get caught up in the effect, a problem the Moto G Power didn't have. I also think the TCL phone did a better job separating my daughter from the background, though more expensive phones with better sensors and more powerful neural engines would make her pop even more. More importantly, the TCL 10L gets her skin tone correct, while she's too shiny and pale in the Moto shot.Maybe the TCL 10L is just better at handling skin. I much prefer the selfie TCL's 16MP front camera shot, as it accurately picked up some of the ruddiness of my face. The Moto G Power's shot is almost as good in terms of skin tone, but it did blur my eyebrow.You won't see this in any of the photos I took, but my TCL 10L review unit added a TCL watermark to the corner of every shot. For some reason, TCL has that watermark enabled by default, forcing you to dig into the camera settings to turn it off. TCL tells me that a future software update will turn the watermark off by default. All the same, that would be the first setting I'd double-check if I got my hands on a TCL 10L.If you're expecting powerful performance from a sub-$300 phone, you're shopping in the wrong part of town. That said, the TCL 10L comes equipped with a Snapdragon 665 system-on-chip supported by 6GB of RAM. Forget about keeping pace with the iPhone SE 2020 and its class-leading A13 Bionic processor, but the TCL 10L will deliver solid performance that can handle most tasks a typical smartphone user can throw at it.Apps launch at about the same speed on the TCL 10L as they do on the Moto G Power and Moto G Stylus, which also use the Snapdragon 665. I noticed the occasional hiccup playing games like PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9, but those are very demanding games for a mobile device, and about the outer limit of what you'd expect to run on the TCL 10L.In terms of benchmarks, the TCL 10L turned in the kind of results we'd expect from a phone with its processor and memory. In the Geekbench 5 test of general performance, the TCL 10L's multicore score of 1,354 was just behind the Moto G Power (1,387) and Moto G Stylus (1,406). All of those phones posted better numbers than the more expensive Pixel 3a, which has a Geekbench 5 score of 1,336.The TCL 10L actually outperforms Motorola's latest phones in some graphics tests. On 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL test, the TCL 10L posted a score of 1,782, just ahead of the 1,756 result for the Moto G Stylus and well in front of the Moto G Power and its 1,704 tally. None of those phones match the Pixel 3a's 2,543 result.Don't expect a lot of storage from the TCL 10L, which ships with 64GB of capacity. A microSD slot lets you add another 256GB to the phone. The Moto G Stylus doubles the on-board storage of TCL's phone, though.The TCL 10L isn't the longest-lasting phone in TCL's new lineup, but it's not far off the pace set by the TCL 10 Pro. That phone, powered by a larger 4,500 mAh battery averaged 10 hours and 47 minutes on our custom battery test, in which we have phones surf the web over LTE until they run out of power. The TCL 10L, which has a 4,000 mAH battery, finished 48 minutes behind its counterpart, with a result of 9 hours, 59 minutes.That's about an average result for a smartphone on our test, though the TCL 10L's performance was far behind comparably priced phones from Motorola. The Moto G Power currently offers the best phone battery life we've seen from recent handsets, lasting more than 16 hours on our test. While that phone is optimized to last a very long time, even the Moto G Stylus, which has the same sized battery as the TCL 10L, outperformed TCL's phone by more than 2 hours on our battery test.TCL didn't include a fast charging feature with the lower-cost TCL 10L, and our test results reflect that. After charging a drained TCL 10L for half-an-hour, the battery indicator was only up to 27%. Contrast that with the TCL 10 Pro, which TCL says can get up to 50% charged after 35 minutes thanks to its Quick Charge 3.0 support.For a phone that's not tied to any carrier, there sure are a lot of unnecessary apps on the TCL 10L, with apps like Gallery, Video and Music duplicating the efforts of their preinstalled Google counterparts. Nxtvision gets its own app, too, which is fair enough since that lets you fine tune the marquee feature on this phone. But that same app is also accessible through the Settings app, which features redundant.You'll also find a separate Smart Key app, which lets you customize one of the more useful features included with the TCL 10L. In Smart Key, you can program the button on the left side of the phone to perform specific actions with single and double presses. (A long press of the button appears to be reserved for Google Assistant; you can only toggle that feature on and off.) I reprogrammed the smart key on my TCL 10L to launch the camera with one press and turn the phone's flashlight on with two presses. It's a pretty convenient way to do some basic tasks without having to unlock the phone.Speaking of unlocking the phone, TCL included a fingerprint sensor on the back of the TCL 10L, just below the phone's camera array and just above the company's logo. The sensor looks a little smaller than similar rear fingerprint readers on Moto's G series phones, but I found it pretty easy to reach around and unlock the TCL 10L without brushing my finger against the camera array.The TCL 10L runs Android 10, and TCL has committed to at least one major OS update after that — presumably Android 11, after it arrives later this year. Beyond 2021, though, it's unclear if you'll be able to get newer versions of Android, though TCL also promises consistent security updates.Do you value a smartphone for its great display, or do other features like camera, battery and performance carry more weight with you? How you answer that question will go a long way to determining how you feel about the TCL 10L.After all our testing for this TCL 10L review, it's clear this budget phone has an outstanding screen, especially for a device that only costs $250. If you mainly use your phone to consume videos, play games and while away the hours on Instagram, the TCL 10L would be a great phone to pick up.Other aspects of TCL's budget phone just don't impress, though. It's not that the TCL's battery life or camera performance is poor — though the great work with color the TCL 10L does with its display is not in evidence with its rear cameras — but that other similarly priced phones do those things better. Both the Moto G Power and Moto G Stylus last longer on a charge. The G Power takes better pictures while the G Stylus includes a stylus for jotting down notes.As good as the TCL 10L's screen is — and it's very, very good — it's hard to recommend this device over some of the other best cheap phones that shine more in other areas."
101,Samsung Galaxy A51,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a51,"Price: $399 OS: Android 10 with One UI Display: 6.5-inch OLED (2400x1080) CPU: Exynos 9611 RAM: 4GB Storage: 128GB; expandable up to 512GB Rear camera: Quad-lens: 48MP wide (ƒ/2.0), 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2), 5MP depth (ƒ/2.2), 5MP macro (ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 32MP (ƒ/2.2) Battery: 4,000 mAh Size: 6.24 x 2.90 x 0.31 inches Weight: 6.07 ounces One look at the $399 Samsung Galaxy A51 and its laundry list of features, and you might wonder why anyone needs a $1,000 Galaxy S20. You get a 6.5-inch OLED display, four rear cameras and a big 4,000 mAh battery for a very reasonable price.There’s only one problem: Samsung may have stepped up its midrange phone game, but so too has the competition. And while the Galaxy A51 can claim a few advantages over the similarly-priced iPhone SE 2020 and Google Pixel 3a, it still suffers from occasionally subpar performance, low-light photography that often fails to impress, and battery life that’s only decent.Indeed, this is one of the best cheap phones around; though, as you'll find in our Samsung Galaxy A51 review, it's more of a jack of all trades than a master of one.The $399 Samsung Galaxy A51 released on April 9. You can buy it unlocked direct from Samsung, or through a variety of carriers, including Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and Xfinity Mobile. Amazon is also selling the unlocked version.There’s only one configuration of the Galaxy A51 available in the U.S., and it comes with 4GB of RAM and a generous 128GB of storage. If you need even more space, you can add a microSD card up to 512GB in size.While $399 is a reasonable price for a phone with all the features the Galaxy A51 boasts, Samsung is running a number of promotions to make it an even better deal. The company is offering up to $220 in credit toward a Galaxy A51 if you trade in a Galaxy S9, Note 9 or older; iPhone X or older; or Pixel 3, 3 XL or 3a. With an eligible trade-in, you can also pay off an unlocked Galaxy A51 over 24 months with zero-percent interest, at $14.58 a month. For a limited time, Samsung is even throwing in a free pair of first-generation Galaxy Buds with every A51 purchase.One word of advice for shoppers: Be wary of alternate Galaxy A51 models circulating around retailers across the web. If the price seems to good to be true, chances are you're probably looking at the Latin American or international variant, rather than the U.S. edition tuned for domestic networks.Lots of phone makers like to tout how their flagship designs trickle down into more affordable midrange models, and Samsung is making similar noises about the Galaxy A51. However, in a shocking twist, I’ve found I actually prefer the A51’s look and feel to its Galaxy S20 extended family.There are several reasons for that. First, the A51 is light — really light. Samsung has always done a good job of building featherweight phones that still feel well made, and the A51 is indicative of that. Its 6.5-inch display is nearly two inches larger than the 4.7-inch panel inside Apple’s new iPhone SE, and yet the A51 only tips the scales at 0.8 ounces heavier. Holding them each in one hand, you can tell the Galaxy is a smidge heftier, but not by nearly as much as you might assume.Second, the A51’s display is flat, which is actually a breath of fresh air from the curved panels inescapable in every modern premium handset. It’s hard to put my finger on, but a flat screen simply feels simpler to use and easier to live with. Some curved panels look weird head-on (e.g., Motorola Edge Plus) while others are magnets for unintentional taps, made worse by poor palm-rejection software (e.g., OnePlus 8 Pro). But the A51 is attractive, with its super-slim bezels and a display that perfectly follows the silhouette of the body. Those aspects in particular truly make it feel like a pricier phone than it is.But it gets better: the A51 has a headphone jack — something you won’t find on Apple’s cheap new iPhone. Unfortunately, though, it's not IP-rated water resistant; in fairness, that's a rarity at this price point.I have but two small criticisms of the A51’s design. First, while the iPhone SE and Pixel 3a both pack stereo speakers mounted in the earpiece and the bottom of the frame, the A51 routes all audio through the latter. It’s not a dealbreaker at this price, though it does lead to that classic problem of muffling sound when cradling the phone in your hands sideways as you play a game.Second, the materials that comprise the A51 don’t feel cheap, though they’re no replacement for the glass-and-metal iPhone SE, or the partially matte-textured Pixel 3a.Samsung actually has a name for what it uses on the back — it’s officially known as “glastic” — and I’m pleased to say it feels more like actual glass than that groan-eliciting name might lead you to believe. I don’t even mind the subtle iridescence of our Prism Crush Black review unit. Usually, that sort of thing registers as gaudy to me, though the A51 doesn’t catch light in an obnoxious way. However, I could do without the frivolous lines and triangular designs on the back, as it’s a constant reminder of the phone’s budget roots.One of the best things about last year’s Galaxy A50 was its AMOLED display — a luxury typically reserved for more premium devices. The new Galaxy A51 retains that dazzling panel, except this time it measures 6.5 inches from corner to corner, while keeping a full-HD resolution.All OLED panels are not created the same, and so the Galaxy A51’s screen can’t quite match the astronomical peak brightness or high dynamic range of the displays in the Galaxy S20 series. The A51 tops out at 565 nits of full-screen brightness, which is quite high — though you’ll only see that kind of luminosity outdoors, under harsh sunlight. Ordinarily, the highest manual setting leaves you at about 353 nits, which is a lot dimmer than the iPhone SE’s 653 nits maximum.But then, of course, the iPhone SE’s display isn’t OLED — it’s LCD. And because the iPhone’s screen is LCD, it can’t deliver the robust hues and deep blacks that the A51 routinely churns out.Watching Ken Miles’ epic final laps in the film Ford v Ferrari on the Galaxy A51, I was impressed by the sunlight breaking through the trees lining Le Mans’ Arnage corner, bathing the treetops in a warm glow while leaving the forest depths suitably murky. I’ve become used to observing that kind of contrast in flagship phone panels, but it’s not something I ever expect to see from devices as inexpensive as this Galaxy.On its default Vivid setting — which is extremely saturated, it has to be said — the A51 rendered 212.2% of the sRGB color space, compared to the iPhone SE’s 111.2% and the Pixel 3a’s 182.3%. The A51’s Delta-E color accuracy takes a hit under the Vivid profile as well, as Samsung’s phone registered a Delta-E score of 0.30 under our light meter, compared to the respective 0.20 and 0.18 scores of Apple and Google’s budget handsets. (Numbers closer to zero are better in the Delta-E test.)You might expect one or two cameras from a $400 phone, but the Galaxy A51 has a whopping four on the back: a 48-megapixel, ƒ/2.0 wide-angle primary shooter, supported by 12MP ultrawide, 5MP depth and 5MP macro optics. A 32MP sensor serves selfie duties on the front. That’s a whole lot of megapixels, and when conditions are favorable, the A51 can pull in a lot of detail, and churn out shots that compare favorably against the iPhone SE's best work. Samsung’s Live Focus mode isn’t restricted to people, like Apple’s Portrait Mode is, so you can get shallow depth-of-field shots of anything — even this lantern. Overall, the iPhone’s white balance and lighting is more realistic here, though I do like the A51’s depth effects, even if some details on the fringes of the lantern are blurred erroneously. That ultrawide shooter shines when the sun does, too. The iPhone SE lacks a lens with a similarly all-encompassing perspective, and so iPhone owners are at a loss to capture shots like this one of a backyard the A51 delivered. Apple’s device also went for a strangely warm cast here, which doesn’t ring true given the conditions. The shot from the Galaxy device isn’t perfect — the shed on the right is totally blown out, for example — though there’s a surprising level of detail overall in Samsung’s shot, and good dynamic range as you move from the shadows to daylight. I was even impressed by the A51’s macro camera — an optic that’s easy to overlook, given the quantity on this device. I was able to get astonishingly close to these lilies, and the result was more crisp and simultaneously less noisy than I anticipated. If I have one gripe, though, the macro lens does have a habit of bleeding color out of scenes, because both this and another image I captured of lavender suffered from slightly drab, undersaturated hues despite the sun shining outside.By now though, you may have noticed the qualifier that keeps popping up with every comparison: the A51 needs ideal lighting to take decent shots. Case in point, the example you see below, which was captured at dusk. First off, I have to stress how poor the A51 is at focusing in low light; while the iPhone SE easily locked onto the plant without me having to lift a finger, the A51 made no attempt to adjust its gaze, and tap-to-focus didn’t work either. I had to keep moving the Galaxy back and forth to ascertain any kind of lock, and when I did, I ended up with the shot you see above.I was also able to get much closer to the flowers with Apple’s device. While the A51 has that aforementioned macro shooter, it only works at a distance of millimeters; conversely, if I tried to draw any closer with the primary lens, the shot you see above would have turned out blurrier than a Monet painting. I’ll concede that the A51’s photo is obviously brighter, but if you look closely, it’s marred by absurdly bold colors that don't mesh with the actual lighting outside, as well as excessive grain. Neither of those issues plagued the iPhone’s rendition.What about night shots? Well, you’d think the A51 would be better equipped for such scenarios, because it has a night mode — something Apple’s cheapest iPhone lacks. As I discovered though, it’s not very useful. In complete darkness, the shots it captures are totally unusable — smeary globs of grays that comprise fodder for horror films. In other instances, like the example above, the Night Mode just doesn’t make much of a difference.Even without a similar setting, the iPhone SE turned in a sharper shot, with more natural color that didn’t render the shadows a dim blue. There’s slightly more visibility overall from the A51’s version of things, and the light beaming outdoors from the window is brighter, but as a tradeoff, you actually lose some detail in the pink curtains.Indoors, things didn’t get better for the A51. Its rendition of various things atop my desk was washed out next to the iPhone’s more-precise, less-noisy take. The purple book has a distinct texture that the Galaxy totally fails to convey, and every last drop of color has been squeezed out of its cover. Instead of several mediocre cameras, perhaps Samsung would have been better off giving the A51 one or two very good ones. Finally, we turn to the selfie side-by-side, which again illustrates that while the A51 is capable of producing sharp photos, it also has a tendency to do strange things with color. Not only is the entire frame oddly cool, but my hat is the wrong color, and the trees in the background seem to have lost most of their needles against the blown-out sky. Rather than using one of Qualcomm’s midrange 600- or 700-series chipsets, the Galaxy A51 derives its power from Samsung’s own Exynos 9611 CPU and 4GB of RAM. The 9611 is an 10-nanometer, octa-core processor, and its closest competitor is probably the Snapdragon 665, which happens to feature in the just-launched Moto G Power.Mid-tier silicon like the 9611 should suffice to handle all but the most demanding games, and perhaps you might expect it to be flustered by frequent app switching when a lot of tasks are going on concurrently. Strangely though, the A51 seems to excel at games — for a budget handset, anyway — while struggling with the simple stuff, like opening apps and rotating orientation when moving in and out of videos.While Asphalt 9 Legends doesn’t run quite as smoothly on the A51 as it does on one of Samsung’s flagships, and while you will notice a slight hit to the resolution and anti-aliasing, it’s not as drastic a slump as you’d think. I was still able to take out competitors and drift to victory, even despite some dropped frames here and there. PUBG Mobile also looks crisp and fluid in motion on the A51, and I was surprised to see the battle royale shooter default to high settings the first time I tried it out on this device.But then, you’ll go to do something routine on the Galaxy A51, like open Chrome or swipe up to reveal the app drawer, and there will be a delay, or an animation that stutters unexpectedly. Scrolling through restaurant listings in Google Maps feels sluggish at times, and the camera typically hesitates to launch unless it’s recently been opened.Some of these annoyances have been typical of cheap phones in the past, but they’re harder to excuse given the recent competition in the segment. The new iPhone SE feels every bit as responsive as an iPhone 11 Pro, given that it utilizes the same A13 Bionic processor. You can see more details in our Galaxy A51 vs. iPhone SE face-off. Meanwhile, the Pixel 3a’s user experience is comparable with that of Google’s flagships. Using the A51, I couldn’t help but think that a $400 Galaxy phone should be snappier than this.The benchmarks illustrate the problem. The Galaxy A51 managed a score of just 1,293 in the multicore Geekbench 5 test. The Pixel 3a from last year beats it, at 1,336, while the $249 Moto G Power turned in a respectable 1,387. (It’s almost unfair to highlight the iPhone SE’s result here, but if you’re curious, it was 3,226.)The A51’s showing in 3DMark’s Sling Shot OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test was a bit better. There, Samsung’s device totaled 2,057 points, nearly splitting the Moto G Power’s 1,734 and the Pixel 3a’s 2,543 scores. Ultimately, this budget Galaxy’s performance isn’t poor enough to be a dealbreaker, though prospective buyers should note that some other phones in this price range don’t force you to compromise in the same way.Samsung has shoehorned a 4,000-mAh battery into the Galaxy A51, which seems quite large considering how slender this device is. That big battery, plus the A51’s hardware being optimized more for efficiency than all-out power, should guarantee exceptional battery life — or so you'd think.Yet the A51 averaged just 9 hours and 16 minutes in our custom battery test, where devices endlessly load webpages while set to 150 nits of screen brightness, until they eventually run out of juice. The handsets on our best phone battery life list top 10 hours.The A51’s runtime is below average for smartphones these days, though it happens to be in line with the new iPhone SE, which endured two minutes longer in the same test. However, even that's not very encouraging, once you consider that the iPhone’s battery is less than half the capacity of the A51’s.The battery story gets worse as you begin comparing the A51 to its Android contemporaries. The Pixel 3a lasted 11:59, while the new Moto G Power turned in a whopping 16:10 with its 5,000-mAh battery. This Galaxy’s longevity isn’t awful, though, much like its general performance, it’s not nearly as impressive as you’d hope it to be.Samsung packs a fast charger in with this phone, but given the size of the battery and the brick’s 15-watt speed being rather inadequate to push all that juice, it’s really fast in name only. Over the course of a half hour, our review unit went from zero to just 31% — again, a pretty unremarkable result.The Galaxy A51 comes out of the box with Android 10 installed, and on top of that you get Samsung’s One UI. Although I’ve never been one for phone makers’ user interface tweaks to Android, One UI is a pretty comprehensive package that is more than just a reskin, adding useful features that you don’t often see in phones as cheap as this, like the ability to capture scrolling screenshots and store media in secure, password-protected folders.Rather than use a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, the A51 incorporates an in-display optical scanner that works well most of the time — though it requires a little patience. It’s not immediate like the capacitive sensors of old, and it can be a little finicky, particularly if you’ve just washed your hands. Optical sensors can’t deal with moisture, and so the A51’s isn’t unusual in that regard. Nevertheless, even if you’ve dried your hands well, the A51’s sensor seems to be particularly sensitive to even the slightest degree of dampness.Samsung has committed to two years of software updates and support for the Galaxy A51, and plans to issue security patches on a quarterly schedule, unlike the monthly basis of its premium Galaxy S- and Note-series devices. That’s actually better than what most Android phone makers typically do for their lower-cost models, though it doesn’t quite equal the three years of updates Google provides for its Pixel devices — let alone Apple’s unparalleled support timetable for its handsets.On paper, the Samsung Galaxy A51 would seem like the best cheap phone $400 can get you. It has a phenomenal display for the money; a gigantic battery; a processor that seems fast enough; and a quad-lens camera system that gives you more versatility in shooting than its single-lens rivals from Apple and Google.But once you dig past the spec sheet, the flaws start to reveal themselves. The A51’s display is pretty, but not bright; its battery is big, but doesn’t last as long as the big batteries in other phones; its processor gets randomly flummoxed by basic tasks; and all those camera lenses provide many perspectives, but not a whole lot of quality.Thus, our Samsung Galaxy A51 review found a generally good phone, but a difficult one to recommend when the competition offers more.Sure, the iPhone SE looks positively dated next to Samsung’s offering, but it’s hard to argue with all the power in Apple’s device, and the impressive photos it can churn out. The same can be said of the Pixel 3a’s camera; Google’s phone also lasts longer on a charge than the A51, and will soon be replaced by a successor that will probably be even better overall. And if it's battery life you want, well, you can’t do better than the $249 Moto G Power right now, which features a processor that actually compares impressively to the one inside the A51.That leaves this Galaxy in a tough spot. The A51 is a phone I wanted to love — I was impressed by its design from the moment I took it out of the box, and it’s encouraging that we’re reaching a point where you can get such a large OLED screen and 128GB of storage in a device for less than $400. Yet, as solid as it is, you get the sense something’s missing here."
102,Sony Xperia 5,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/sony-xperia-5,"Price: $799 Display (resolution): 6.1-inch OLED (2520x1080) Rear cameras: Triple: 12MP primary (ƒ/1.6); 12MP telephoto (ƒ/2.4); 12MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 8MP (ƒ/2.0) CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 6GB Storage: 128GB microSD slot? Yes; up to 512GB Battery: 3,140 mAh Battery life: 9:12 Size: 6.22 x 2.68 x 0.32 inches Weight: 5.78 ouncesYou know it's a sign of the times when $799 begins to sound like a reasonable price for a flagship smartphone. With premium Android handsets like the Samsung Galaxy S20 creeping well past the four-digit mark, $799 for Sony’s triple-camera, Snapdragon 855-toting Xperia 5 is a refreshing proposition.In fact, it's a proposition that gets even sweeter once you consider that the Xperia 5 is essentially a more compact version of Sony's Xperia 1, with the same three 12-megapixel rear lenses, speedy processor, generous RAM and storage and up-to-date Android 10 software.The only difference is that the Xperia 5 stuffs all that into a 6.1-inch body, rather than a 6.5-inch one. It also skips the Xperia 1's battery-draining 4K OLED panel for a lower-resolution, though still-adequate, 1080p one, with the same cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio.That all sounds good on paper. And yet, there's still this nagging sense that something is missing with the Xperia 5. Whether it's the mediocre cameras and battery life, Sony's half-baked software ideas or quirky ergonomics, our Sony Xperia 5 review reveals a serviceable high-end handset that fails to make a meaningful impression, and falls shy of landing on our list of the best Android phones.The Sony Xperia 5 is available from retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy for $799. It's also unlocked and compatible with all American carriers, including CDMA networks like Verizon's. Right now, Amazon has the best deal going for the Xperia 5, having slashed the price by $100.There's only one configuration of the Xperia 5 on offer in the U.S., and it comes equipped with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You can choose to expand that by another 512GB with the use of a microSD card if you're wanting for more space.Sony remains committed to the extra tall (or extra wide, if you're watching video) 21:9 aspect ratio with the Xperia 5. If it was a bit shorter, the handset would certainly qualify as a small phone. However, the device's slender proportions mean reaching that upper left or right corner with your thumb will be a daunting challenge for most, even though the bezels aren't that large on this 6.1-inch device.Still, when watching the right TV show or movie, or scrolling through your preferred social media app of choice, the aspect ratio occasionally proves its worth. It's not a transformative experience or anything, though it benefits some uses more than others. Playing games built to accommodate the width of the display is a more comfortable experience, for example, because your thumbs obscure less of the action. And anything filmed at 21:9 obviously wins out.The aspect ratio, then, isn't my lasting issue with the Sony Xperia 5's design. Rather, it's the awkward ergonomics. This is a cleanly styled, classy handset in the way Sony hardware often is, but it's plagued by some head-scratching choices.First, it's a magnificently slippery phone, with its flat glass black (which strangely does not allow for wireless charging) and rounded sides. Second, every one of the Xperia 5's buttons is lined down the right side, and there are too many of them. Sony is once again relying on a side-mounted capacitive fingerprint sensor here, but it doesn't double as the power key. Instead, that's nestled below the scanner, while the volume rocker is above it. There's also a two-stage camera button all the way near the bottom-right corner.In my first few days with the Sony Xperia 5, this strange placement of switches resulted in an endlessly repeating comedy of errors. The side of my thumb would brush up against the sensor as I removed the phone from my pocket, which would register as several incorrect scans. Then I'd be locked out of using my fingerprint to authenticate, and forced to input a PIN code instead. And when I wanted to stop using the Xperia 5, I'd instinctively press volume down every time rather than the power button, before awkwardly curling my thumb down to reach the correct key.There must be some good reason why Sony couldn't simply embed sleep/wake functionality inside the scanner like every other phone maker that's mounted its sensor on the side, yet here we are. Truthfully, though, I don't really care what the excuse is. When so many companies have moved onto facial recognition or in-screen optical or ultrasonic sensors, the fact Sony is still falling short in this regard isn't funny anymore, just depressing.In typical Sony fashion, there is a lot of branding surrounding the Xperia's 6.1-inch full-HD+ OLED display. It has that aforementioned 21:9 aspect ratio, which in Sony parlance makes it a CinemaWide panel. It boasts HDR support via Sony's Bravia X1 for Mobile engine, and features something called Creator Mode — which according to the company allows users to ""watch movies as the creators intended.""Watching Season 2 of Netflix's Formula 1 Drive to Survive, I personally couldn't speak to whether the sparks, tire smoke and metallic carbon-fiber chassis looked quite how the documentarians wanted them to. That said, everything did look rich, vibrant and captivating on the default display profile, and the extra-wide aspect ratio did make things a bit more immersive, even if the show was made for 16:9 screens.But when I switched to Creator Mode, I was disappointed with how excessively warm it made all on-screen content. It's reminiscent of the ""film"" or ""theater"" settings on most TVs, like a light sepia filter that tints everything, or one of those eye-care settings designed to cut down on blue light, so the display is softer on your eyes.Creator Mode also makes everything look dimmer, which isn't helpful because the Xperia 5's display doesn't get very bright to begin with. The phone's peak full-screen brightness tops out at 318 nits — almost a third as bright as the Samsung Galaxy S20's 857 nits, and still far behind the 752-nit iPhone 11 Pro.Additionally, the Xperia 5's 105.3% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space is distant from the Galaxy S20’s 162.5%. That translates to colors that are more tempered and arguably more realistic on Sony's panel, but not as eye-catching and saturated as those on the Samsung device.Like the iPhone 11 Pro, the Xperia 5 incorporates a triple 12-megapixel rear camera, split between wide-angle, ultrawide-angle and telephoto lenses. Unlike the iPhone 11 Pro, the photos it takes are often hit and miss.As with most flagship phones, the flaws in the Xperia 5's approach to imaging don't reveal themselves in broad daylight. This scene, captured on a sunny day in a suburb outside London, looks absolutely serviceable through the Xperia 5's wide-angle shooter. The Pixel 4's rendition seems generally brighter in the shadows — something visible in the blue barriers on the right of the frame, and the brick building on the left — but the difference isn't all that significant.However, indoors or at night — really anytime light is less plentiful — things begin to suffer. This Totoro plush, captured using the shallow depth-of-field bokeh mode on each device, looks tragic through the Xperia 5's telephoto lens. If you look closely, the individual fibers blend together in multicolor waves, which is quite poor for a flagship phone with a high-grade Sony image sensor and optics. The green stem of the leaf Totoro is holding is strangely blurry as well.And it only got much worse when I snapped a portrait of my colleague Henry in the Tom's Guide office. Everything about Henry's face is washed out, over-brightened and almost out of focus compared with the same shot as captured by Google's flagship. It's a shockingly poor showing.And what about those night shots? Well, inexplicably, Sony's camera software does not provide a manual night mode. That's really hard to believe when practically every handset from every other phone maker is doing that these days, but indeed, the only time the Xperia 5 will only optimize exposure for night shots is when its auto mode deems it necessary.Then again, looking at the example of a night shot above, you begin to wish Sony never bothered with a night mode to begin with. The image I captured here was so staggeringly washed-out and beige and blurry that I took it several times and tapped around the display to adjust metering just to correct for user error — and none of that seemed to make a difference.But then sometimes, the Xperia 5 can surprise you, like it did here with this lovely shot of a Glasgow courtyard at night. Sony's software really homes in on those lights drizzled above the buildings, pumping those up and pulling out some warmth from the buildings encircling the grounds. The version of this scene captured on the Pixel 4 is arguably more realistic — and also a bit better at illuminating those darkest areas — but you could certainly make the case that the Xperia 5's shot is prettier and more Instagram-worthy.The Xperia 5's 8-MP front-facing camera is pretty average, delivering splotchy, flat shots like the selfie you see above that over-brighten shadows and pepper the frame with a fair degree of noise. And the sensor's small megapixel count doesn't help sharpen things, either.The Xperia 5 comes fitted with Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 855 processor and 6GB of RAM. However, high-end Android phones nowadays, beginning with the Galaxy S20, are now touting the latest Snapdragon 865 silicon. That puts Sony's hardware at a bit of a disadvantage.Granted, it's not a massive one. The Snapdragon 855 is still plenty fast, and ensures the Xperia 5 is on similar footing as last year's Galaxy S10, OnePlus 7T and many other devices. It's just not the most powerful Android phone you can buy today.The benchmarks put this into perspective. The Xperia 5 achieved a multicore Geekbench 5 score of 2,711 points — some 400 points behind the Galaxy S20 (3,147) and nearly 800 points behind the A13 Bionic-powered iPhone 11 Pro (3,509), indicating inferior overall performance. Meanwhile, in the GFXBench Aztec Ruins Vulkan graphics test, the Xperia 5 notched 1,052 frames at 16 frames per second — again a long way behind Apple’s most powerful iPhone, which recorded 2,174 frames at 34 fps.The gulf in numbers may sound profound, but the Xperia 5 is still a strong performer overall, and powerful enough to handle demanding titles like Fortnite and Asphalt 9. There was some choppiness running the former at the highest graphics fidelity setting the game allows — and the Xperia 5 did get toasty in the process — but that's more or less consistent with the experience on other flagships that utilize the same CPU.The 3,140-mAh battery inside the Sony Xperia 5 isn't particularly large among premium phones these days. Then again, this phone doesn't have a massive display or 5G connectivity, so the relatively small capacity is somewhat excusable.And so it tracks that the Xperia 5's longevity on a charge isn't Earth-shattering, though it could certainly be worse. Sony's phone lasted 9 hours and 12 minutes in Tom's Guide's custom battery test, where devices endlessly reload webpages over a T-Mobile LTE connection until their batteries run dry.How does that compare with other top handsets? Google's Pixel 4, which has a 5.7-inch panel and the same processor, lasted 8 hours and 3 minutes in the same test. The 5G-enabled Galaxy S20 endured 9 hours and 21 minutes, but uses a 4,000-mAh battery. And the iPhone 11 Pro lasted 10 hours and 24 minutes — and its battery is about the same size as the one in the Xperia.Charging speeds are relatively quick, but not lightning fast, as the Xperia 5 makes it to about 53% from empty after 30 minutes when using the stock USB PD adapter. Unfortunately, however, the phone doesn't support wireless charging — something that's quite surprising, given its glass sandwich design and the fact most of its premium contemporaries these days provide the feature.The Sony Xperia 5 launched with Android 9 Pie software on board, but can now be upgraded to Android 10. The latest version of Google's mobile OS has a few improvements surrounding location access, notification controls and sharing content — but for the most part, it's a relatively iterative release.Sony's Android skin, to its credit, adds a lot of functionality that doesn't come baked into Android by default, like Sony's exclusive Stamina battery-saving mode. Unfortunately, though, most of those extras aren't particularly useful.Side Sense is one such feature — a strip of shortcuts and customizable commands that surface when you double-tap the edge of the phone's display. Side Sense has been a staple of Xperia devices for a while now, and it's not a terrible idea, but it's never been intuitive to activate and that's unfortunately the case on the Xperia 5 as well. In fact, the vast majority of the situations in which I launched Side Sense happened accidentally, when the side of my palm brushed against the top of the phone's frame.Dynamic Vibration, another odd feature that sounds gimmicky in theory but is even worse in practice, activates the phone's vibration motor in tandem with sound playing while you're listening to music or watching a video. This too is something you'll probably want to keep off — especially when you set the phone down on a table, so it doesn't vibrate itself off the ledge into an untimely demise.With the Xperia 5, Sony has once again built a phone that is serviceable in most respects, though you'd have a hard time recommending it over other options.The Samsung Galaxy S20 is a bit more expensive, but better in practically every way — especially in its display, performance and camera quality. The OnePlus 7T (which will likely soon be replaced by a new model, the rumored OnePlus 8) costs hundreds less than the Xperia 5, but offers performance that is on a par with Sony's handset, if not better; plus, OnePlus' Oxygen OS software is superior, too. And Apple's range of iPhones beats out the Xperia 5 where battery life is concerned.That's not to say the Sony Xperia 5 doesn't have its advantages: You can find it for as low as $699 from some retailers, its industrial design is really tasteful in that classically Sony way, and it's a good unlocked option to bring to the carrier of your choice. But those highlights are buried by, oh, so many quirks — quirks the bulk of other high-end smartphones don't have, and they're better for it."
103,Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-lite,"Samsung's Galaxy S10 Lite is an absolutely gigantic phone that could rival last year's Galaxy S10 Plus when it comes to battery life and performance. Unfortunately, it also seems to match last year's S10 lineup for price.Price: $650 Screen (Resolution): 6.7-inch Super AMOLED (2400 × 1080) CPU: Snapdragon 865 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB Rear Cameras: 48MP main (f/2.0), 12MP ultra wide (f/2.2), 5MP macro (f/2.4) Front Camera: 32MP (f/2.2) Battery Size: 4,500 mAh Size: 6.4 x 3 x 0.32 inches Weight: 6.7 ouncesSamsung just announced a $650 price for the Galaxy S10 Lite. You'll be able to buy the phone directly from Samsung as well as from Amazon and Best Buy starting on April 17. At Samsung, you can take $250 off the price with an eligible trade-in. Best Buy is also taking $200 off with qualified activation of the phone. At Amazon, you can get a free pair of Galaxy Buds with purchase.In an age where flagship phones approach $1,000, $650 may seem like a bargain. But there's more to the S10 Lite's price than there seems at first glance, especially given what's happened since we first saw the Galaxy S10 Lite during CES 2020 in January. At the time Samsung hadn't announced pricing or availability, but we had hoped to see a price cut from what the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus cost.A lot's changed in the months since we had our hands-on time with the S10 Lite. For starters, Samsung introduced a new round of flagship phones, the Galaxy S20 family. And with built-in 5G plus big camera improvements, those new phones command a high-price — $999 for the S20 and eye-popping prices of $1,199 and $1,399 for the Galaxy S20 Plus and Galaxy S20 Ultra, respectively.In an unusual move for Samsung, the company kept the S10 lineup around and cut prices by $150 on those older models. The S10 now costs $749 while the S10 Plus has a starting price of $849. You can likely find more discounts on those phones depending on where you shop.The S10 Lite's $650 price is $200 cheaper than the S10 Plus, but only a $100 savings off the S10. A budget-minded shopper could turn to the Galaxy S10e for $599, though the S10 Lite will likely appeal to users who prefer bigger screens and longer battery life.The Galaxy S10 Lite is a massive 6.7-inch smartphone that is larger than even the 6.4-inch Galaxy S10 Plus. Samsung made some trade-offs for that big screen, though: The S10 Lite's display is lower-res (full-HD+) than the S10 Plus (wide quad HD+), it's Super AMOLED rather than Dynamic AMOLED and the materials are a little less premium (a glassy plastic rather than glass).The S10 Lite comes in three shades: Prism White, Prism Black and an elegant Prism Blue. All three are incredibly fingerprint magnets, if that kind of thing is important to you.The Galaxy S10 Lite sports a triple-lens array, like the Galaxy Note 10 Lite also announced this past January, but the two cameras are very, very different.The S10 Lite sports a 48-megapixel wide-angle lens with Super Steady optical image stabilization, a 12-MP ultra-wide-angle shooter and, interestingly, a 5-MP macro lens for shooting subjects at close range.The Note 10 Lite's cameras are a little more conventional (wide, ultra-wide and telephoto). We're curious to see how the S10 Lite's macro results fare against the incredible photos we've seen from the Google Pixel 4 and iPhone 11 Pro.Good news if you're getting the S10 Lite: It will pick up some of the software features Samsung introduced during the Galaxy S20 launch. Thanks to a software update, you'll get the outstanding Single Take feature, which captures multiple shots at once using the phone's different cameras. Additional photo features include Pro Video, which gives you more control over settings, and Night Hyperlapse for time-lapse videos in the dark.Like the Galaxy Note 10 Lite, the S10 Lite has an absolutely gigantic 4,500 mAh battery. The Galaxy S10 Plus sports a 4,100 mAh battery and lasted 12:35 on the Tom's Guide Battery Test. With a less battery-intensive display, we expect the S10 Lite so turn in an impressive performance — hopefully enough to include it on our list of best phone battery life.The Galaxy S10 Lite packs in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 chipset but lacks the Galaxy S10 Plus's productivity-oriented storage (256GB) and RAM (up to 12GB)  options. The S10 Lite announced in January offers 6GB or 8GB of RAM and just 128GB of storage — the version available to U.S. shoppers features 8GB of memory.The 855 processor also powers the S10 Plus, and that phone was one of the top-performing Android flagships of 2019. Since then, of course, Qualcomm has come out with the Snapdragon 865, which is the chipset powering this year's Galaxy S20 family.The S10 Plus starts with 8GB of RAM, which contributes to its blazing fast performance, but the S10 Lite shouldn't lag that far behind.The Galaxy S10 Lite's battery and processor could put it ahead of the Android competition. An ultra-low price would seal the deal.We're curious to see how the S10 Lite's cameras, particularly the outlandish 48-MP wide-angle lens and the 5-MP macro lens, stack up against the device's pricier predecessors, especially with the promised software update introducing some of the features that impressed us when we reviewed the Galaxy S20.Stay tuned for a full Galaxy S10 Lite review."
104,LG V60 ThinQ 5G,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lg-v60-thinq-5g,"It goes that if something isn't broke, you don't fix it. Evidently, LG feels that way about its flagship smartphones. The Korean tech giant has taken a very iterative approach with its premium mobile line over the last two years and change, and that philosophy has flowed into its latest offering: the LG V60 ThinQ 5G.Mind you, iteration isn't necessarily a bad thing, and our LG V60 ThinQ 5G review found that this phone isn't entirely the worse for it. This is a very complete handset — arguably more complete than even the Samsung Galaxy S20, given that LG appears to be one of the few phone makers left that's committed to the headphone jack. The V60's battery life also marks a satisfying step forward for LG, whose devices always seemed to lag behind the competition's in endurance.Nevertheless, LG's continued emphasis on evolution, rather than revolution, has produced yet another flagship that feels like a refresh of a rehash rather than a candidate for one of the best phones you can buy right now. And while other phone makers are innovating with camera hardware, fast-refreshing displays and exotic materials, LG seems quite comfortable immersed in the status quo. Sure, the V60 is good enough, and its battery life lands it firmly on our list of the longest-lasting phones. But this phone offers nothing we haven't seen before.The LG V60 ThinQ 5G is available from T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon for $899. That sum not only gets you the device, but also its LG Dual Screen case, which adds an identical second display that you can add and remove at will. T-Mobile offers the phone sans case for $799.The V60 comes in two colors — Classy White and Classy Blue — but cannot be purchased unlocked at the time of writing. That may change down the line, though the lack of an unlocked option may be a function of the phone's 5G network support, because major carriers retain exclusivity over some 5G bands.The V60 can connect to both long-range, sub-6GHz 5G, as well as the much faster, albeit shorter range millimeter-wave (mmWave) configuration of 5G. T-Mobile and AT&T have primarily concentrated on the sub-6GHz side of things to date, while Verizon has focused on mmWave — though it's still early for all of these carriers, as they're continuing to build out their 5G infrastructures.The V60 might look big in photos, but trust me — it's quite another thing to hold the phone. LG has fitted this device with a 6.8-inch display, and while that's technically a tenth of an inch smaller than the 6.9-inch panel on the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, the V60 is actually taller and wider, because of its moderately thicker bezels and lack of curvature around the sides.As Tom's Guide's persistent small-phone evangelist, I'm irked by the LG V60 ThinQ 5G's gargantuan proportions. But there's a reason this early wave of 5G phones is so large and ungainly; it's a consequence of having to pack in all the radios necessary to connect to those emerging networks, as well as leaving enough space for a beefy battery to compensate for 5G's increased power consumption.Despite this, I'd still go so far as to call the V60 pretty — even though it's almost indistinguishable from many of the V-series devices before it, and even though it may not be ergonomically friendly. I like the phone's chamfered edges that merge anodized aluminum with a more reflective, metallic finish where the frame meets the front glass. I like the subtle trim around the triple-camera module, and I like the understated elegance of the flat display. The V60 especially looks great in blue, because that colorway swaps the white model's silver chassis for an eye-catching gold.In fact, my only gripe about the V60's design — aside from its size — is its buttons. The left side of the device carries the volume up and down keys, as well as a Google Assistant key just below those. The problem is, all of these buttons are exactly the same size and trimmed with the same texture, making it difficult to tell one apart from the others in a pinch. This certainly could have been mitigated with the use of a volume rocker rather than breaking volume up and down into separate keys, and I'm not sure why LG wasn't satisfied with that solution.When you do locate those volume keys, though, you'll find that the speakers can get awfully loud — louder than most phones we've tested to date. The inclusion of a 3.5-millimeter jack and quad digital-to-analog converter when using headphones also make the V60 a good choice for audiophiles, though as I'm not an audiophile myself, I couldn't discern much of a difference whether the DAC was on or off.LG's OLED displays are usually quite good, but a step behind Samsung's — and once again, that rings true for the LG V60 ThinQ 5G. The 6.8-inch panel in LG's newest flagship gets decently bright, though not as bright as the screens you get in the Galaxy S20 range. It's also not as sharp and can't animate quite as fast.Let’s start with the brightness. The V60's full-screen peak of 578 nits isn't bad, but it's outshined by the iPhone 11 Pro (761 nits) and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus (847 nits). Indoors, the relative dimness is no big deal, but it impedes readability when using the V60 outside on a sunny day.The V60's full-HD+ resolution (2460x1080) also translates to fewer, less densely packed pixels than in quad-HD devices, like the Galaxy S20 line. If the V60's screen were an inch smaller, this wouldn't really bother me, as the density would be acceptable for the size. But once you approach 7-inch territory, you're spreading those pixels out a bit thin, resulting in graphics, text and games that just don't look as precise as when viewed on competing flagships.The V60 also has no answer to the S20's 120Hz refresh rate, which delivers animations twice as smooth as on conventional, 60Hz panels. Many phone makers — from Google, to OnePlus, to Samsung — have started experimenting with fast-refresh screens, and the results have been enticing, especially regarding touch responsiveness. The V60's screen looks fine enough, but it doesn't drive the industry forward and lacks any sort of innovative features, making it feel like a bit of an afterthought.LG's mobile cameras have rarely been industry-leading, though they're often better than they get credit for. The V60 packs three lenses on the back — a primary 64-MP wide-angle one, a 13-MP ultrawide and one of LG's time-of-flight Z Cameras — along with a 10-MP front-facing shooter. The 64-MP main lens can even record 8K video.It must be said that the choice of optics here is a bit head-scratching — particularly the decision to devote space to a depth sensor rather than a telephoto lens. It's likely that a telephoto camera would have driven up the device's cost, but it's also incredibly useful, both for shallow depth-of-field portraits and zoom shots. Without a telephoto, the V60 can't deliver the 3x or 4x optical quality of the Galaxy S20 family, or even anything to match the iPhone 11 Pro's 2x lens. And, historically speaking, time-of-flight sensors seldom justify their existence.That's not to say the V60 doesn't have tricks in its camera arsenal. That 64-MP main lens can merge four pixels into one to allow more light to reach the sensor. The resulting shots are quite bright — perhaps too bright, judging from the washed-out example the V60 delivered here of a plant. The Galaxy S20's attempt suffers from heavy-handed, artificially boosted greens and shadows due to Samsung's Scene Optimizer technology, but the V60's version is hardly perfect, either. In fact, it looks undercooked by comparison, which is surprising, considering both of these pictures were taken on a sunny day.Turning to the V60's performance in the dark, LG's camera app left the shutter open for a full 4 seconds to capture this idyllic night scene. However, the V60 still pulled in much less detail in the shadows compared with Google's Pixel 4. In fairness, it was extremely dark out when this picture was taken — I snapped it about 9 p.m. — so the V60's version of things is the more realistic of the two, dimmer though it is. That said, oftentimes users look to night mode to illuminate what can't be seen — not to necessarily deliver the most true-to-life shot — and so you could make a case for either device here.Indoors, I relied upon the V60's 2x digital zoom and the Pixel 4's 2x optical zoom to capture this pair of photos of die-cast model cars. Considering the lighting was less than ideal, once again, the darker, less colorful result from the V60 is more true to the scene's actual conditions. Still, I prefer the Pixel's punchier hues and improved fidelity in the shadows, particularly around the tires of the white Ford in the foreground.The V60's lack of a telephoto lens means that bokeh-style portraits apply blur to the feed from the ultra wide-angle camera, producing an effect that seems as though it was added after the fact in Photoshop. I don't like it, but nevertheless I was more satisfied with the output from LG's device here, as it better captured the subject's skin tone and struck the appropriate white balance for the scene. The S20's rendition is marred by heavy shadows and boundaries between objects, as well as an overly warm cast.We end with a pair of selfies, and certainly my least favorite picture I took with the LG V60 ThinQ 5G. I can't explain why the V60 made the strange color choices it did here; everything's all wrong, from the oversaturated greens, to the redness of my skin tone, to the color of my beanie, which is more of a coral rather than a light brown. LG's algorithms weirdly drained all the contrast out of the selfie, leaving a surreal result devoid of shadows and highlights.Occasionally, the V60's cameras will produce satisfying results. However, inconsistencies in post-processing, as well as a tendency to overbrighten already well-lit scenes, hold it back from ranking among the best camera phones.Once again, LG is selling its latest V-series device with an optional case that adds a second screen for you to fill up with apps and extra browser tabs. The design here is essentially unchanged from its implementation on the LG G8X ThinQ, the company's last dual-screen ready phone, though there is a new semirugged ribbed texture on the back that makes the device easier to grip when the case is on.And that added bit of grip is important, because the V60 becomes really hard to hold when used in its dual-screen guise. As I alluded to earlier, this is already a massive smartphone, and essentially tacking on a whole extra phone's worth of thickness to a 6.8-inch handset is a daunting proposition, even if you're getting double the real estate out of it.On the 6.4-inch G8X, the second screen made a little more sense; while that device was also large, it wasn't one of the biggest smartphones I've ever used. The V60, on the other hand, might set a new personal record. I struggle to imagine anyone remarking ""you know what this already oversized phone needs? Another display.""Nevertheless, the Dual Screen case is there if you want it, and every carrier offers the V60 with that add-on included. Although LG evidently sees a lot of value in this design — this is the company's third attempt at a dual-screen phone, after all — it's starting to feel like LG has taken this idea about as far as it's ever going to go.For starters, apps just aren't built for it. Chrome will run in two separate instances on each screen, but won't share a pool of tabs. Naver's Whale browser, which comes preinstalled on the V60, is built to run across both screens, but even then the experience is still clunky, as the tab overview in the main browser window doesn't take account of whatever's open on the other screen.LG's digital gamepad is here again, too, just like it was on the G8X, and is equally as frustrating. Depending on which screen you launch a title in, you could end up with the game running on the phone's display, forcing you to hold the wafer-thin second panel as a controller. One time, Asphalt 9 even launched oriented away from the other screen, which would've been more irritating if it wasn't so funny in the moment.Dual Screen quirks aside, the V60 boots with Android 10 out of the box, along with the LG UX skin, which is truly showing its age at this point. The oversize, hyper-colorful icons, mess of indistinguishable quick toggles and needless duplication of core apps (like LG's own photo gallery and messaging apps, alongside Google's much better options) conspire to create an experience that offers no obvious advantages over stock Android, while simultaneously looking aesthetically worse.At least Samsung's OneUI, found in the latest Galaxy phones, can claim some exclusive, useful perks of its own, like the ability to capture scrolling screenshots, or lock apps and media within a secure folder. LG's modifications to Android feel like change for the sake of branding, which is the cardinal sin of a pointless OEM skin. A serious rethink of the interface — or, a cleanup at the very least — is long overdue.Once upon a time, battery life was predictably always the weak link in LG's phones. But last year's LG G8X Dual Screen posed a watershed moment for the company's devices where endurance was concerned, and the V60 continues in the right direction.Then again, with a 5,000-mAh battery on board, it'd be hard for it not to. The V60 lasted an average of 12 hours and 46 minutes across two sessions of Tom's Guide's custom battery test, earning it a well-deserved place on our list of the best phone battery life. Our test forces devices to endlessly load web pages over a T-Mobile data connection, and the V60 fared an hour better than the iPhone 11 Pro Max (11:54) and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (11:58).We also ran that same battery test with the Dual Screen case on and active, with content displayed on the second panel as well. In that trial, the V60 still endured for an impressive 7 hours and 34 minutes. That’s nearly as long as the 8 hours and 4 minutes the 4,000-mAh Galaxy S20 gave us when using its 120Hz refresh rate instead of the default 60Hz setting.The V60 isn't the quickest flagship to charge back up, replenishing 26 percent in 15 minutes and 51 percent in a half hour. By comparison, the OnePlus 7T reaches 61 percent in 30 minutes. Then again, given how long the V60 lasts between charges, that time spent waiting won't come as frequently as it does with other phones.Armed with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 865 chipset and 8GB of RAM, the V60 is on a par with Samsung's latest flagships regarding performance.The V60's showing in Geekbench 5 — an overall system stress-test — was particularly encouraging, as the device turned out an average multicore score of 3,420 across three sessions. That not only beats out the S20 Plus, at 3,076 points, but comes within striking distance of the iPhone 11 Pro Max's 3,517-point result.In GFXBench's Aztec Ruins Vulkan off-screen graphics gauntlet, the V60 tallied 1,313 frames at 20 frames per second (fps) — near as makes no difference to the S20 Plus' 1,319 frames at 21 fps, and a bit further off the mark compared with the iPhone 11 Pro Max's 1,657 frames at 25 fps.All this is to say the V60 is a very powerful phone — among the most powerful you can buy today, in fact, even though it has up to half the RAM of Samsung's most expensive Galaxy, the S20 Ultra. And that power enables the V60 to run two apps simultaneously using the Dual Screen attachment with ease, or make a demanding mobile title like Asphalt 9: Legends look and run its best.At a time when a growing number of phone manufacturers aren't afraid to sell high-end models with prices well beyond four digits, the LG V60 ThinQ 5G, with its massive display, optional second screen and impressive battery life, seems like a good deal for $899. If you're chiefly concerned about longevity on a charge, or the prospect of a flagship smartphone in 2020 with a headphone jack really excites you, it's not a bad choice at all.Then again, after spending time with the V60 for this review, it's become clear that the inclusion of the Dual Screen accessory makes this phone seem like a better value than it actually is. I struggle to imagine most people getting use out of a whole second display when the existing one already measures 6.8 inches. Once you factor in the bulk the case adds, it becomes an even harder sell, and for a negligible benefit.Strip the Dual Screen element from the equation, and you're left with a serviceable flagship that is better priced than its contemporaries (though just barely) with average cameras, a screen that feels a generation behind and software that's even more dated than that. The V60 isn't bad, but it reeks of obligation, rather than inspiration. And it makes you wonder: after the V30, V30S, V35, V40 and V50 — all of which were separated by indistinguishable differences — how many more times does LG plan to build this phone?"
105,Huawei P40 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/huawei-p40-pro,"The Huawei P40 Pro is what happens when a company is forced to scramble in the face of huge obstacles. Last year's Huawei 30 Pro was an excellent camera phone that came out before Huawei was effectively banned from using Google apps on its phones. That ban hit the Huawei Mate 30 Pro particularly hard, as last fall’s release fell flat.The P40 series — and specifically the P40 Pro — has had more time to adapt to a life without the Google Play Store, and Huawei has had the chance to improve on last year’s features. The result is once again a phone that could crush the competition when it comes to photography, but will cause headaches in the software department. Our hands-on Huawei P40 Pro review demontrates that Huawei has closed the gap with the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and the iPhone 11 Pro. If you want the best hardware at any cost, you'll want the P40 Pro. But if you value convenience, you should still look elsewhere.The Huawei P40 Pro, with its single 8GB RAM/256GB storage version will cost 999 euros ($1,095/£912 converted), and will be available to buy from April 7. This will be available in the UK, at the same time as the 799 euro P40 ($875/£730), and will then be joined in June by the 1,399 euro ($1,533/£1,279) P40 Pro Plus. One thing we do know for certain is that the Huawei P40 Pro won't be coming to the U.S.Because the U.S. government believes Huawei to be a danger to national security, the company is forbidden from trading with American companies, meaning you won't find the P40 series handsets in any mobile carrier store either in person or online. Shoppers in Europe are expected to have access to the P40 series as normal through electronics stores and mobile carrier outlets.There will likely be ways to import the Huawei P40 Pro. Typically this involves buying a Chinese or Latin American Huawei handset from an online auction site or importing one from a phone store. This can be expensive, and can lead to cell signal compatibility problems if you don't check which frequency bands the specific version you're buying supports. Starting Price: TBA Display: 6.58-inch quad-HD AMOLED; 90-Hz refresh rate CPU: Kirin 990 RAM: 8GB Storage: 128GB, 256GB microSD: Yes, up to 256GB (NM Card) Rear camera: Quad-lens: 50MP primary; 12MP telephoto with 5x lossless zoom; 40MP ultrawide; time of flight Front camera: Dual-lens: 32MP primary, time-of-flight Battery: 4,200 mAh Size: TBA Weight: 7.41 ounces/210g (unofficial)The first thing you'll spot when you power up the P40 Pro is the change in notch style on the phone’s display. The waterdrop notch is gone, and now we've got a pill-shaped double cutout in the top left corner. It takes up a fair chunk of screen, but so does the iPhone 11 Pro's notch and people mostly tolerate that. It initially looks odd to have such a large punch-hole floating away from the edge of the P40 Pro, but the cutout doesn't get in the way of your normal phone activities and disappears into a black sidebar if you turn your phone sideways to watch a video or play a game.Unlike Samsung, which abandoned the curved edge display in favor of a flat panel on the S20 series, Huawei has doubled down on curves for the P40 series. The screen features an ""overflow display"" that curves on the top and bottom as well as the sides, giving a near-full screen look to the P40.It's not quite a full screen because there are still small bezels visible at the top and bottom, and all four corners have considerable bezels, making the display look like it's tucked into a black photo album page. The curves are also not as extreme as the Mate 30 Pro's ""horizon display,"" but it's still an attractive shape overall.On the back of the P40 Pro, the camera bump is a big black lump in the top left corner. While it looks pretty ugly, the camera bump at least looks like it means business, particularly with its proudly displayed Leica branding, the lens company that’s again helping Huawei with its camera hardware.The bump emerges from the back of the phone at a smooth but sharp angle, what Huawei describes as a ""volcano"" design, but it does make the P40 Pro wobble a little when placed on its back, a common problem with camera bump-bearing phones but. The rest of the back is plain, aside from the Huawei logo on the bottom left.Taking a tour around the P40 Pro's edges, you'll find a microphone and IR sensor at the top, the volume rocker and power button on the right, the external speaker grille, USB-C port and SIM tray on the bottom (no headphone jack once again sadly), and a completely empty left side.For Huawei P40 color options, Huawei offers Pearl White, black or DeepSea Blue (the color of my review handset) for the normal gloss finishes. There are also Silver Frost and Blush Gold as matte finishes, but sadly the black or white ceramic backs are reserved for the P40 Pro Plus only. That's a whole lot of colors, and I think all of them look great, although there's no super bright option for people looking to show off their P40 Pro.The P40 Pro shares its display with the P40 Pro Plus: a 6.58-inch OLED screen with a resolution of 2340 x 1200 and a 90Hz default refresh rate. As we mentioned, the display has a slight curve on all four edges, but while it's enough to hide some of the bezels, it's not enough to make it hard to find the edge when you're using Android 10's gesture navigation mode.Personally, I think this is a great compromise between looks, the viewing experience and ergonomics, and shows that despite some companies steering away from curved screens, there's still a good reason to have them on phones.The Huawei P40 Pro has a refresh rate of 90Hz that can be turned down to 60Hz, and the resolution can automatically switch to or be set to 1760 x 800, both great options that can help you save battery life. The 120Hz displays on Samsung’s Galaxy S20 models are obviously smoother, but do drain the battery significantly based on our testing.Arranged in a rectangular bump in the top left corner, the Huawei P40 Pro has four rear sensors — a 50MP main camera with Huawei's special RYYB sensor, a 12MP 5x optical telephoto zoom (maxing out at 50x), a 40MP ultra wide camera and a time-of-flight sensor to enhance the other three cameras with depth-accurate photo effects. I compared the P40 Pro to my current phone, the iPhone 11 Pro. In a close-up of a daffodil using the two phones' main cameras. We see that the P40 Pro retains one of Huawei's classic photography traits — a tendency to capture lower color temperature images than its competition. This helps the green background look much more lush in the P40 Pro’s photo, but the bright yellow of the flower means you lose some of the detail on the petals that the iPhone 11 Pro manages to pick up.This medium shot of Holly the beagle is similar. The cooler colors don't capture Holly's reddish-brown fur at its best, while the iPhone 11 Pro does a better job showing the different hues present within her coat. The iPhone also doesn't overreact to the light coming in from the window in the top left, while it causes discoloration to the sofa in the P40 Pro's image.For the zoom comparison, I took two sets of pictures of this red front door with its squirrel-shaped knocker: one at 2x zoom, the optical magnification of the iPhone 11 Pro, and one at 5x zoom, for the P40 Pro, to see how they handle both digital and optical zoom. At 2x, the P40 Pro's image is much brighter, as we've come to expect. However, some of the detail in the door's inset panels gets lost.At 5x, the extra brightness seems to cause less of a problem for the P40 Pro, allowing us to appreciate the lines carved into the back of the door knocker more easily than we can on the iPhone 11 Pro's image.Finally, this wide shot over a Northumbrian field shows a great contrast. Part of that is that the iPhone 11 Pro's wide angle lens is wider than the one fitted to the P40 Pro. However, the P40 Pro's 40MP sensor is far larger than the 12MP lens on the iPhone, meaning that it captures a more detailed and color faithful image of the bright spring morning.I returned to take some night shots, a difficult task given the lack of artificial light in the area. Both phones returned a decent silhouette of the treeline and a nicely colored night sky, but you can see in the comparison photos that the iPhone 11 Pro's image is far noisier. This is exactly where Huawei's large and super sensitive main sensor shines, capturing an undeniably better image.On the front of the P40 Pro, you get the 32MP selfie camera that Huawei used on the P30 Pro, but now there’s an extra time-of-flight sensor, both to improve photo effects and for the facial recognition mechanism. This is a similar set-up to what the iPhone 11 Pro has on the front, except the iPhone's camera is only 12MP.The Huawei's selfie is naturally much more detailed, but seeing the imperfections in my skin and my pallid complexion hardly makes me want to upload this picture to Instagram (although Huawei has plenty of in-built beautification tools in the Photo app should you want them). The iPhone image is a lower resolution, but not to an unpleasant amount, and the post processing is much more flattering. Both phones do a good job at blurring the background in the bokeh portrait mode, although I pop out more against the window in the Huawei's image thanks to a sharper outline.Our Huawei P40 Pro review found that the new phone’s cameras excel where Huawei camera phones always excel — at the extremes of light and darkness, where the size and power of the camera sensors can be used fully. However, for the average photo, you'll find rival phones do just as good a job, and perhaps even better depending on how you like your images to look.The raw stats of the P40 Pro are fairly good, but somewhat lacking. The Kirin 990 CPU inside of the new phone is powerful but doesn't match the Snapdragon 865 or A13 Bionic processors in the Galaxy S20 or iPhone 11 series, respectively. The P40 Pro’s 8GB of RAM is enough memory, and more than you'll find in an iPhone 11, but looks weak compared to the 12GB used in the S20 series.The Huawei P40 Pro comes with 128GB or 256GB of storage with the option for adding up to 256GB more by using one of Huawei's Nano Memory cards, a proprietary equivalent to an SD card.I was unable to try out our normal GFXBench test for graphics due to difficulties getting a working app, but I was able to run Geekbench 5 on the P40 Pro. It scored 756 points in the single-core test and 3,047 in the multi-core test. That's not as good as the Galaxy S20 Plus, which scored 818 and 3,076 respectively, but not too far off in terms of multi-core performance. Sadly, the P40 Pro didn't have a chance against the iPhone 11 Pro, which managed 1,337 and 3,509.Overall, the P40 Pro runs really well. Asphalt 9: Legends plays smoothly and with a minimum of heat. And switching between multiple apps didn't result in lag, despite the middling amount of RAM.Huawei has made significant improvements with unlocking its phones. Returning from the P30 series is the optical fingerprint scanner, except now it's larger, faster and has been moved a little higher up the phone's body, meaning you don't have to adjust your normal grip in order to unlock the P40 Pro.However, I barely used the fingerprint sensor, because Huawei has added the Mate 30's infrared-enhanced Face Recognition. This isn't as sophisticated as Apple's Face ID with its dot projection, but it's still far more secure than most Android face unlock options. The Huawei P40 Pro recognized me whether or not I was wearing glasses, and during my testing against my iPhone 11 Pro, the P40 Pro unlocked just as quickly.The Kirin 990 chip comes with 5G support by default, and it’s compatible with networks built using the sub-6Ghz standard, but not those using mmWave. This means you won't get the enhanced speeds and reliability that 5G brings if you set up the P40 Pro on most US networks, which are using mmWave only. But the P40 Pro should work with any kind of 5G network you want to use it with in the UK, a select few in the US, and those in nearly any other country around the world that's got 5G live right now.The battery in the P40 Pro series isn't very large. It comes with a 4,200 mAh battery, the same as the P30 Pro from last year and 300mAh smaller than what powers the Galaxy S20 Plus. The Galaxy S20 Ultra has an even larger 5,000 mAh battery.We'll need to do some more testing to see how the battery life stacks up in normal use, but considering how generous Huawei was with the battery capacity on the P30 and Mate 30 series, it's odd that there has been no increase whatsoever. That said, we’d be very happy if the P40 Pro matches the P30 Pro’s impressive 12 hour, 53 minute result on our battery test, which involves continuous surfing over LTE until the phone runs out of power.Huawei offers a pair of fast charging options on its new phone. The P40 Pro can fast charge up to 40W like the P30 Pro, but it can also wirelessly charge too. I tested the wired charger, and found that in half an hour, you can fill the P40 Pro from empty to 70%. Compared to the 55% you can achieve with the Galaxy S20 Plus or iPhone 11 Pro, this is quite impressive.You can also reverse wireless charge with the P40 Pro, if you want to share power with a friend or charge up a compatible accessory.While there may not be any Google apps on the P40 Pro, the phone runs Huawei's EMUI 10.1 interface, which is built on the open source version of Android 10. Meanwhile, App Gallery — Huawei's stand-in for Google Play — is starting to pick up steam.When I reviewed the Mate 30 Pro, I criticized the the App Gallery for how poorly optimized it was for English speaking users. Now, however, I can download a browser like Opera, shop on the Amazon app and check my Facebook notifications. With a little fiddling about in the browser, I can even have the web app versions of my other most used apps quickly available. The only notable absences on App Gallery are Netflix and other popular western streaming services, and the G Suite apps I use for work. However, Huawei provides you with WPS Office, a Chinese-built competitor that can save text documents, spreadsheets and presentations into popular formats, so you can still collaborate with people working on Microsoft or Google's equivalents.Huawei obviously wants you to use the App Gallery, but it also suggests using Phone Clone to port apps over from your old device, bypassing the re-downloading problem. Alternatively, there are third-party app stores you can use, such as the Amazon App Store, which lets you access popular apps like YouTube, provided you sign in with an Amazon account. There's also the option to download APK files online yourself, though carries security risks. I'm not thrilled with the Huawei P40 Pro's software, but I feel comfortable now saying that if you're prepared to put some work in and swap a few apps for similar competitors or bookmarked browser versions, you can have a near-normal Android experience on the P40 Pro.As for Celia, the revamped version of the HiVoice digital assistant that Huawei's been bundling with its phones for a few years, its voice is a lot more artificial than Siri or Google Assistant, and it's pretty slow to react to your commands since it needs to use the internet to process them. Google Assistant can perform many tasks without a data connection. Still, Celia was able to open the apps and take the pictures I commanded eventually. It may sound like damning with faint praise, but I am happy that the Huawei P40 Pro is close to a normal Android phone. Huawei always does a good job with its hardware, so I have no trouble recommending this phone to people who want something like a Galaxy S20 Plus but with a more unique design and arguably superior camerra. Now that Huawei's mostly got its act together with the App Gallery, I can almost see myself taking the plunge, moving my files and apps over and making the P40 Pro my personal handset.If you want a straightforward Android experience, you should go for the Galaxy S20 Plus or Galaxy S20 Ultra, or maybe wait for the OnePlus 8 Pro. If you're only half-hearted about wanting a Huawei phone, you're still better off looking elsewhere, or at least waiting until Huawei adds more apps to the App Gallery or makes amends with the US government. But if you feel like you can't do without the mighty cameras, near-edgeless 90Hz display and other small but handy features, then you're the right kind of person to become a Huawei P40 Pro user."
106,LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lg-g8x-dual-screen,"The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen is a pleasant surprise from LG. The premise is simple: buyers get a removable cover case that adds a second 6.4-inch OLED display identical to the one inside the phone. You get all the versatility of a foldable phone, without the durability concerns or astronomically high price.You don’t have to use the case, nor will you want to all the time — it adds a lot of bulk, and some kinks in the software keep it from being beneficial in every context. But that extra real estate certainly has its appeal, and even without it, the G8X is still one of the best phones available, at a very reasonable price.The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen starts at $649. The phone is available at AT&T and Sprint, as well as through B&H and Amazon. At launch, the phone will come with the Dual-Screen attachment no matter where or how you purchase it, though LG tells us it will offer the case separately as an add-on at a later date, for a price yet to be determined.Anyone looking to avoid an installment plan through a carrier can choose to buy the G8X Dual Screen unlocked and take it to any network, as the phone supports all the bands used by wireless providers in the U.S. There’s only one configuration — a model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage — though you’re free to expand the latter by up to 2TB using a microSD card.Untethered to the Dual screen case, the G8X ThinQ barely looks different from LG’s last several flagships, whether you’re comparing it to the original G8 or the newer V50 ThinQ 5G. The fact that LG has blurred the distinctions between its two premium lines doesn’t help the G8X stand out, either.There’s no getting around it — the G8X is an intimidating device in its dual-screen guise.There’s nothing particularly wrong with the G8X’s design; in fact, the phone’s biggest fashion crime might be that’s it’s simply too forgettable. The omission of the depth-sensing Z Camera on the earlier model has allowed LG to pare down the notch on the main display to a teardrop shape, which has definitely helped streamline the aesthetics.I’m also intrigued by the lack of a camera bump on the back, which makes the G8X the only high-end handset in recent memory (save for its predecessors) to keep its lenses neatly tucked beneath the rear glass. LG also deserves props for retaining the headphone jack here, as it’s one of the only phone makers that still makes a habit of including one.At 6.7 ounces, the G8X is more than a full ounce lighter than the iPhone 11 Pro Max. It’s only when you attach the 4.72-ounce Dual-Screen case that the G8X really makes its presence known.There’s no getting around it — this is an intimidating device in its final, two-screen form, and one that’s almost impossible to use comfortably one-handedly. LG’s 360-degree Freestop Hinge allows you to flip the second display onto the back, which at least allows for semi-effective two-thumb typing — though it’s still a bit of a reach (particularly for your left hand, as that hinge is quite thick.)However, with that thickness comes strength. The Freestop Hinge can indeed pivot to any point and stay put, and it feels rock solid. But the case isn’t perfect. The volume and Google Assistant buttons, which are accessible through extra keys on the hinge, are essentially obscured when the second screen is folded out. It makes you wonder why LG didn’t simply line all those buttons down the right side of the device.Because the phone’s USB-C port is occupied in Dual-Screen mode — that’s where you plug in the second screen — there’s a magnetic port on the exterior of the case that requires a proprietary MagSafe-style dongle (which is supplied in the box), so that USB-C cables or accessories can plug into the G8X. As a one-time MagSafe loyalist, I was looking forward to this, until the breakaway design quickly proved more frustrating than useful. The magnetic latching is too weak, and if the charging cable gets the slightest bit snagged, the dongle is in turn pulled upward or downward, severing the connection.I do like the 2.1-inch LCD strip on the front of the Dual-Screen case, which relays simple information, like the date and time, connectivity status, battery level and notification icons. However, I’m less of a fan of the mirrored surface that blankets it, which easily picks up fingerprints. At least a hole for the speaker grille up top means you can still take calls on the G8X when closed; in such situations, the Google Assistant button on the side is used to accept or reject calls.The G8X is the best two-screen phone I've ever used, but who am I kidding — that’s as faint as praise gets. It's not as if LG has had quality competition in this space, and previous multi-screen offerings from the likes of ZTE’s Axon M and others have been curtailed by messy software.But the G8X works in dual-screen guise most of the time, and that's because LG hasn't tinkered with the traditional Android-user experience too much. It's a surprisingly straightforward affair; just open the case, and the second display essentially functions as another phone, with its own home screen. There are scenarios where certain apps (like web browsers or YouTube, for example) can span across both halves, but for the most part, the extra real estate is deployed for dual-wielding apps, which happens to be what the G8X does best.Managing all that space is easy thanks to a handy three-finger-swipe gesture, which instantly moves any app open on one display onto the other. There's also an on-screen button that expands to list all dual-screen-related controls, like swapping the content between the displays and turning off the extra screen.That's not to say that there aren't some quirks that make the experience rougher than we’d like. Chrome is the G8X’s default browser, as it is on most Android phones — yet this is one of those rare cases where you sort of wish it wasn't. There are no provisions in Chrome to move individual tabs between displays, so you’re forced to run a separate instance of the app (each with its own sandboxed tabs) for two-screen browsing. There is a third party alternative — Whale Browser by Naver — that is optimized for LG’s dual-screen system, though it doesn’t come preinstalled, which feels like a missed opportunity.Gaming can be a bit of a head-scratcher, too. You can use the second display as a virtual gamepad, and to that end LG provides several templates: a console-style layout, one with a steering wheel for racing games, another that resembles a fight stick and a retro-inspired basic option. The console option registers as a physical gamepad in titles that support them; however, you can also build your own custom controller with an editor, and tie any virtual buttons you place to touch-screen inputs.A handy three-finger swipe gesture makes it easy to move apps across displays.It's all very well thought through — save for the process of actually launching games in the first place. When gaming in dua- screen mode, the natural thing to do is use the main display as the controller, because the half of the case with the phone in it is significantly heavier than the other, and playing in a flipped fashion would make the device far too top-heavy to hold.However, the G8X doesn’t default to this orientation. In fact, depending on which display you open LG’s Game Launcher app in, and the order in which you summon the pad and the game itself, you can very easily find yourself in a situation where everything’s on the opposite screen from where it should be.The funny thing is, on some level LG was aware that this could happen, so it cleverly provided a software button on the pad to switch displays. Unfortunately, though, this button never actually worked in my experience — it was always greyed out. I’ve found that the best process of starting games in dual-screen mode is to open the Game Launcher in the second screen, then the LG Game Pad from there, and finally the title itself — but your mileage may vary.And still, even when you get the gamepad situated just right, it doesn't always improve the experience. Racing fan that I am, I found the console-style pad was totally ineffective for Asphalt 9: Legends; the fake analog sticks were impossible to locate without looking at them, and far too cumbersome for cornering. Using the driving controller in tandem with haptic feedback definitely helped, though it still took quite a lot of getting used to.Replacing digital inputs with yet more digital inputs doesn’t make the G8X Dual Screen a viable stand in for an actual controller, and so I’m not sure that there’s much value in this add-on for gaming. Rather, I think the extra space is best served for multitasking — like having a YouTube video running while you’re web browsing, or perusing a restaurant's menu on one screen while looking up directions on Google Maps in the other. And while LG’s stock keyboard resulted in a record number of awkward autocorrects, I have to commend the company for one stellar feature — a button which immediately screenshots whatever is on the other display, then appends it to a message. Brilliant.Reading this, you might be wondering how LG’s $699 dual-screen device compares to Samsung’s $1,980 Galaxy Fold. On the surface, the differences are vast — the Galaxy Fold has a single 7.3-inch, flexible AMOLED panel that literally folds in half, while the G8X has two separate displays joined by a central hinge.Having a pair of screens instead of one big one obviously means that LG’s handset is less well-suited for expanded, tablet-style apps, though the G8X can drive two apps simultaneously with no problems. On the flip side, LG’s traditional approach of a two-screen clamshell is significantly more durable compared to the Fold’s flexible display, which is prone to punctures and failures, as we witnessed during the Fold’s rocky launch.However, in other respects, the two devices are more similar than you might think. Both are powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 system-on-chip, meaning that you can expect roughly equal performance no matter which you choose. And because both run Android, the user experiences are quite similar — save for LG’s and Samsung respective UI customizations, which have been added to make Google’s operating system more natural to use with unique form factors.In short, Galaxy Fold buyers at this stage are really paying for the privilege of being among the first in the world to have a flexible display in the palm of their hands. The technology is exciting to watch, though seemingly not ready for widespread public consumption yet — making the G8X the much safer choice for anyone interested in a phone that folds.The 6.4-inch OLED panel on the G8X is pleasant enough most of the time — just not on the sunniest days.That’s a casualty of its dim peak brightness of 403 nits. The iPhone 11 Pro Max (763 nits) and Samsung Galaxy S10 (611 nits) handily beat the G8X. Even the 429-nit Google Pixel 4, which is on the low-end in terms of modern OLED displays, squeaks out ahead of LG’s latest handset.In other respects, there’s less to complain about. At a resolution of 2340x1080, the G8X’s display renders images and text that aren’t quite as sharp as those on the Quad HD+ panel inside the original G8, though I didn’t miss the extra pixels.Color reproduction is still strong here, as the G8X registered 176.8% of the sRGB color space in our lab. That’s quite a lot higher than the iPhone 11 Pro Max (118.6%), Pixel 4 (130.1%) and OnePlus 7T (155.1%), indicating that LG’s panel is tuned for more saturated hues than the bulk of the competition out of the box. However, there are six other color profiles to choose from besides the default Auto setting available to G8X users, so those who don’t like what they see have free rein to tinker.LG tells us that the OLED display in the Dual-Screen case is identical to the one used in the G8X itself, which explains why it has a purely cosmetic notch. Using the same panel off the production line not only saves costs, but ensures that the two displays are as closely calibrated  as possible.Still, we noticed a slight difference in white balance when comparing both screens. The phone’s panel seemed a tick cooler, though I wouldn’t say the discrepancy was egregious by any stretch; you’d only notice it when looking at the same website simultaneously on each display. Minute differences in OLED calibration are difficult to stamp out on the production line, so it’s something we can live with.It’s hard to believe technology has reached a point where a flagship phone with only two lenses on the back seems behind the times, yet here we are. The G8X partners a 12-megapixel (MP), ƒ/1.8 primary shooter, a 13-MP ultrawide on the back and a 32-MP camera for the front. That’s it.In other words, you won’t find a telephoto here to offer an optical zoom, or dramatic close-ups when shooting in Portrait Mode. While I might lament the lack of a true zoom lens, I have to concede that LG’s made the right call here by prioritizing the ultrawide, especially given the public’s fascination with the iPhone 11’s ultrawide camera.That’s not to say LG hasn’t forgotten what really makes a great phone camera in 2019 — reality-bending software. Consider this shot I captured at Manhattan’s Herald Square using the G8X’s Night View mode. The Pixel 4’s rendition is admittedly better at dealing with the highlights, but the overall result also appears more obviously processed. In contrast, the example from LG’s phone sports a more natural-looking and evenly-distributed grain to it. The G8X doesn’t try too hard to resolve detail in the darkest regions, which actually works to its advantage in visualizing the environment the way our eyes do.MORE: Best Smartphone Cameras 2019It was a nice night, so I snagged one more picture from the same vantage point with the G8X — but this time, I used the ultrawide lens. This shot really illustrates how the shorter focal length can transform your shooting, though it comes with a tradeoff.The 136-degree field of view of the G8X’s ultrawide lens captures more in the frame than, say, the 120-degree optics inside the iPhone 11. But the consequence is more distortion at the fringes. Phone makers have tried various methods to correct for the stretched, blurry fisheye effect you often get from ultrawide cameras — sometimes by using artificial intelligence, and other times by physically cropping into the center of the frame and discarding the fringes. Whatever tactics LG has employed, they haven’t helped much.I came away less impressed by the G8X’s main camera outside the New York Public Library on a dreary October morning. Compared to the Pixel 4’s rendition, LG’s shooter produced an image devoid of contrast and detail, with overexposed shadows and no definition in the highlights.Things didn’t get better for the G8X when I took it indoors to snag a portrait of my colleague Paul in Tom’s Guide’s studio. The iPhone 11 roundly defeats the G8X’s best effort here in every respect — the details in Paul’s face are crisper through Apple’s optics, the fabric of his knit sweater are sharper, and his hair isn’t unnaturally blurred. You could argue that the iPhone 11 applies too much of a reddish cast to his skin tone, but then, the gloomy, murky white balance of the G8X’s shot is hardly more desirable.Finally, I flipped the G8X’s 32-MP front-facing cam around on myself to size it up with the Pixel 4’s 8-MP sensor. The G8X’s shooter incorporates a Quad Bayer filter to bin pixels together for more light sensitivity, though you could also opt for full-resolution 32-MP shots by tweaking the camera settings.The G8X’s front-facing camera is especially important, because it’s the only lens that’s really available when the phone is in the Dual-Screen case. The second display obscures both rear cameras, so when the cover is on, you’re essentially forced to shoot using that extra panel as the viewfinder, while the main display faces the subject. It’s a trippy effect, to say the least — though I suppose it could be useful when enlisting the help of a stranger to take a photo of you.Ultimately, though, this camera isn’t as versatile as you'd hope. While I’m not in love with the deep shadows the Pixel 4 painted over my eyes in the selfie I took using Google’s handset, at least it avoids the cloudiness and flatness of the G8X’s contrast-free interpretation.The G8X’s battery life is well within striking distance of the iPhone 11 Pro Max.LG’s handsets have a habit of not performing particularly well in our battery test, but the G8X is different.Just like the V50 ThinQ 5G, the G8X is armed with a 4,000-mAh battery. But unlike the V50, it can eke more endurance out of a single charge. The G8X lasted an impressive 11 hours and 49 minutes in Tom’s Guide’s battery test, which forces phones to endlessly load web pages over T-Mobile’s LTE network until their batteries run dry, at 150 nits of display brightness.The G8X’s nearly 12-hour result is a far better showing than the last two LG phones we tested; the original G8 and V50 clocked in at 9:29 and 8:28, respectively. In fact, the time even shatters the OnePlus 7T’s middling 8:47 result — and that device’s battery is just 200 mAh shy of the one inside the G8X. And 11:49 is even well within striking distance of the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s 11:54 result.The G8X needs all the juice it can get, because the Dual-Screen case doesn’t have its own battery. To measure how taxing that second display really is — and for our own amusement — we ran the G8X through our test again with both screens active. The juice only lasted 4 hours and 56 minutes, which is comically close to what you’d expect from lighting up twice the number of pixels.The G8X might not technically be the most powerful Android flagship we’ve seen this year, but it’s sprightly enough to run two apps side-by-side on different screens without breaking a sweat. And that’s good enough.With a Snapdragon-855 chipset at the helm and 6GB of RAM, the G8X is even with the Pixel 4 on paper, though benchmarks place LG’s phone ahead by a nose. Where Google’s flagship topped out with a Geekbench 5 score of 2,329, the G8X delivered 2,704 points, indicating slightly snappier overall performance. What’s more surprising is that the result isn’t far off the OnePlus 7T’s 2,759 peak — and that device benefits from Qualcomm’s newer 855 Plus processor, as well as 8GB of RAM.The G8X also bested Google’s latest hardware in 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test by a score of 5,308 to 4,923.Those numbers translate well to everyday use, as the G8X certainly has the power to keep two displays humming along with different apps. The Dual-Screen functionality can be programmed to open an app automatically when the second display is turned on. I have mine set to auto-launch Chrome, and it’s never kept me waiting; my last tab is instantly within reach the moment I unfold the device.LG’s latest revision of its flagship G8 isn’t perfect, but it is pretty solid all-around, and offers a unique user experience if you choose to snap on the Dual-Screen case.The Dual-Screen functionality isn’t perfect, butis a compelling benefit every now and again. Although that seems like a backhanded compliment, it’s probably the best thing about LG’s approach to its folding phone — you’re free to use it when you want to, and you’re not encumbered by it when you don’t. And the fact the case comes with the handset makes it far more compelling than if it were sold separately.It also helps that the G8X ThinQ Dual-Screen is a respectable smartphone in many other ways, with dependable performance, long battery life, a good-if-not-great screen and — last but never least — a headphone jack. The relatively poor camera performance hampers the G8X a bit, but that’s a price some might be willing to pay for the phone's versatility. For better or worse, there’s really no phone like it out there today."
107,OnePlus 7 Pro,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/oneplus-7-pro,review-6472.html","Forget notches and punch holes. The OnePlus 7 Pro ($669/£649) sports a unique full-screen design with a large 6.67-inch display. It doesn't make performance trade-offs. Its photos are pretty damn good. And while it's not exactly cheap, the OnePlus 7 Pro delivers so much for the money thatt it feels like a bargain.The newer OnePlus 7T offers many of the OnePlus 7 Pro's top features (triple lenses, a 90-Hz refresh rate) in a device that costs $599. But if you want a design that turns heads, the OnePlus 7 Pro is one of the best Android phones around.After years of only selling its phones unlocked, OnePlus has started selling some models through carriers. T-Mobile originally offeered the 8GB/256GB version of the OnePlus 7 Pro for $699, though that phone is no longer available, presumably so that T-Mobile can make room for the OnePlus 7T when that $599 model goes on sale Oct. 18.You can still buy OnePlus 7 Pro models  directly from OnePlus, including the entry level 6GB/128GB version for $669. Unlocked OnePlus 7 Pro models work on the GSM networks of T-Mobile and AT&T. Verizon customers can use the phone on that carrier's network, too, but they'll have to contact Verizon to route all calls, messages and data traffic over LTE.Sprint also offers a 5G-capable version of the OnePlus 7 Pro. The phone costs $840, which is more expensive than other 7 Pro models, but a relative bargain compared to other 5G phones like the Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G, which Verizon sells for $1,299. Currently, you can lease the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G at Sprint for $20 a month for 18 months (a $15 discount off the normal rate). For people in the UK, you can buy any of the three versions directly from OnePlus for £649/£699/£799 respectively, or the 8GB/256GB and 12GB/256GB versions from Amazon UK. The 7 Pro 5G is also available on contract with EE, for between £59 and £79 a month depending on how much data you're willing to pay for. (UK shoppers can also get the OnePlus 7T Pro for £699 instead if they want a phone with a faster Snapdragon 855 Plus processor and some other enhanced features.)The OnePlus 7 Pro is, quite simply, gorgeous. Everything about it speaks my language, even though the practical part of my brain hates its size. At 6.4 inches long, the 7 Pro isn't the largest phone you can buy right now, but when I put it in my front pocket, it's big enough to poke me in the stomach when I sit down.But I'm willing to overlook that because OnePlus combines the best parts of Huawei and Samsung's design sensibilities in a flagship phone that costs a third less than those companies' latest devices.The 7 Pro's slightly curved AMOLED makes the gigantic, 6.67-inch screen seem every larger and more immersive. It's reminiscent of Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus, but bigger (and, to my eye, better).Then there's the glass trim and back. Each of the 7 Pro's three shades offers something a little different, but the Nebula Blue and Almond are standouts in a sea of glossy black slabs. The blue model I tested reminded me of Huawei's ombre flagships, but more refined. The matte finish looked navy when the phone was sitting next to me on a table, but when I glanced at it from across my kitchen, the glass reflected cobalt and baby blue hues. It reminded me of a sports car.OnePlus combines the best parts of Huawei and Samsung's design sensibilities in a flagship phone that costs a third less than those companies’ latest devices.The 7 Pro's Almond color wasn't available at launch, but it is now. And it's my favorite of the three: the shade is a creamy vanilla that in certain lights evokes champagne, like the gold iPhone XS does (but more striking).I hate watching TV shows or movies — or anything lengthier than a music video — on a smartphone. Or at least I did, until the OnePlus 7 Pro entered my life.This screen is gorgeous. The 6.67-inch curved AMOLED panel reminded me of Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus display. Like that 6.4-inch screen, the 7 Pro's display earned DisplayMate's A+ rating. But unlike the S10 Plus, the 7 Pro's screen is unmarred by camera cut-outs. No notch swoops down from the top. Whether reading long-form stories, pulling up New York Times recipes or binging ""My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" on Netflix, the 7 Pro's screen completely pulled me in.OnePlus beefed up the 7 Pro's display with a 90Hz refresh rate, which I didn't think would make a huge difference in my web-browsing experience — but it did.The 7 Pro's screen is both brighter and more colorful than the S10 Plus' panel. The 7 Pro's display covers 180% of the sRGB color gamut, which is a wider range than the S10 Plus (136.5%), the iPhone XS Max (123%) and the Pixel 3 (170.2%). The 7 Pro also notched a 0.18 on the Delta-E test of color accuracy, easily beating displays of pricier flagships, such as the S10 Plus (0.29) and iPhone XS Max (0.22).  (Numbers closer to 0 are better.)OnePlus beefed up the 7 Pro's display with a 90Hz refresh rate, which I didn't think would make a huge difference in my web-browsing experience, but it did. Scrolling through Twitter or reading lengthy articles was a delight. I switched between 60 and 90 in the display settings several times just to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me. It's so smooth.MORE: OnePlus 7 Pro vs. Pixel 3: Which Phone Wins?OnePlus isn't the first smartphone maker to extend its display by removing the camera from the screen and putting a retractable pop-up front-facing lens on top of the device. In fact, we saw a front-facing pop-up camera and in-display fingerprint sensor in the Vivo Nex S nine months ago. But that phone lacked polish, which the 7 Pro offers in abundance.In addition to a pop-up selfie cam, OnePlus stacked three lenses on the back of the 7 Pro: a 48-megapixel standard lens, a 16-MP wide-angle lens with 117-degree field of view and an 8-MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom.OnePlus has never offered the best smartphone camera, but the 7 Pro's triple-lens array is damn good, particularly outdoors.In this shot of a cup of ice cream, the 7 Pro's shot is much more natural looking than the Galaxy S10E's photo. The Samsung phone's dual-lens camera added a strange flare to the edge of the peanut butter marshmallow scoop that wasn't there in real life. The Pixel 3's image has better contrast, but is overall darker and cooler than the 7 Pro.Then I captured the Hudson River at sunset using the 7 Pro and S10E's wide-angle lenses. The 7 Pro's photo was more color-accurate, but the lens also distorted the edges. The S10E's shot is more dramatic, but not as true-to-life. However, the wide-angle lens didn't warp the edges of the shot like the 7 Pro did.The Nightscape mode introduced in the OnePlus 6T is much improved in the 7 Pro — the shots are brighter and clearer, and the exposure time is reduced so you don't have to hold still quite as long to ensure a clear shot. In my experience, it rivaled the Pixel 3 for amazing low-light images.I captured a mezcal cocktail perched next to a tall plant in a completely dark bar lit by a single red bulb. The 7 Pro's sensor illuminated the wood paneling so much so that you can see individual grains in each board. You can also see the grooves in the plant. The 7 Pro blows out the rim of the coupe, but overall the 7 Pro's Nightscape mode impressed us.The Pixel 3's image in the same setting is, surprisingly, more natural. The contrast between the plant, the red backlight and the cocktail glass is heightened in the Pixel 3. But its Night Sight mode did nothing to highlight the couch, and you can barely make out any detail in the plant.But you do still need to keep your hands steady. I shot lilacs against a backdrop of plants, trees and a night sky, and I waited until the 7 Pro's Nightscape mode told me the phone was processing the image to move my hand. And yet, I still moved it too quickly for the camera, which resulted in a blurry lilac bush.The pop-up front-facing camera takes perfectly good selfies. And with the extended lens, you'll never forget where to look. Portrait selfies in particular are excellent — the 7 Pro smooths out the area behind my curls in a way that few other flagship cameras can pull off (see: Pixel 3).OnePlus says the retractable camera can sustain opening and closing up to 300,000 times. I obviously didn't get a chance to test the limits of that claim, but it feels sturdy. The company also told me the phone will retract the camera if its accelerometer and gyroscope sense that the device is in free fall. I did not test this, because I was afraid to.The Nightscape is much improved in the OnePlus 7 Pro. In my experience, it rivaled the Pixel 3 for amazing low-light images.The 7 Pro's camera results aren't as consistently amazing as the Pixel 3's AI-boosted shots, or as natural as the iPhone XS's images. But they are very good. If you're upgrading from an older OnePlus, the 7 Pro's camera alone is worth the money.OxygenOS, the OnePlus take on Android Pie, is my favorite of all the Android OEMs. It’s clean, simple, easy to navigate and looks really, really good. OnePlus added two new features to OxygenOS that are actually useful: Screen Recorder and Zen Mode are both accessible in the shortcut tray just a swipe down from the home screen.Screen Recorder is self-explanatory, but incredibly handy. Just tap the icon to launch the recorder, then hit the record button to start taking a video screenshot of your activity. This is useful for how-to help — assisting parents with tech tasks without having to be physically present — or for sharing videos of gaming sessions with friends (or the internet).OnePlus offers a ton of settings for Screen Recorder, including resolution, bit rate, the audio source of the recording, video orientation and, my personal favorite, the option to show a white marker where your finger touches the screen while recording. Instead of adding gimmicky software to an otherwise good phone (LG, I'm looking at you), OnePlus made its latest features practical.MORE: OnePlus 7 Pro Will Fix This One Big ComplaintThen there's Zen Mode, which dials up the Digital Wellbeing features that Google has been working on to make smartphones less addictive. Zen Mode locks you out of your phone for a full 20 minutes — no notifications, no distractions. You can't even circumvent Zen Mode by turning the phone off. You can still make and take calls, and shoot photos. But this is so much more effective than setting timers for apps or making everything grayscale (at least for me). Being locked out of my phone is the only way I won't use it.Smartphone makers tend to sacrifice in some areas to beef up others while keeping device prices low. Google's Pixel 3a takes amazing photos, but uses an older Qualcomm processor, which results in lagging performance.You don't make that trade-off with the OnePlus 7 Pro. The $749/£799 version of the phone that I tested came with 12GB of RAM, which resulted in a 11,227 score on the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance. That's right up there with the $999/£999 iPhone XS (11,420) and its A12 Bionic processor. The 7 Pro easily blazes past the $999/£799 Galaxy S10 Plus (10,732).Synthetic benchmarks aside, the 7 Pro just feels snappy. Web-browsing, playing endless rounds of Asphalt 9, checking the weather while streaming Netflix — everything I did was quick and easy. No lags, no crashes. That's what I expect from $1,000 flagships. For this price? The bar gets a little lower. But not for OnePlus.MORE: The OnePlus 7 Pro Makes Sense, But Will Anyone Buy It?But even if you only spend $669/£649, you'll still get Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 CPU, which powers all of 2019's premium flagships. You might not get iPhone-level speeds, but 6GB of RAM is nothing to sneeze at. For an extra $30/£50, you can snag 8GB of RAM. That'll cost you $699/£699. Meanwhile, Samsung charges $999/£799 for 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 855 in the Galaxy S10 Plus — and you have to deal with that oval camera cut-out on your phone's display.The 7 Pro offers two forms of biometric authentication: the in-display optical fingerprint sensor, which OnePlus has improved since first implementing the feature in last year's 6T, and facial recognition.Both forms are lightning fast. As soon as I pressed my thumb to the highlighted fingerprint sensor on the dark display, I was instantly on the home screen. (OnePlus says the new sensor takes 2.1 seconds to unlock, and recognizes fingerprints more quickly than the 6T.)Then I set up Face Unlock. I thought it might be inconvenient, because the front-facing camera has to pop up, scan my face, retract and open the phone's home screen. Despite all of that, the 7 Pro's Face Unlock feature is much faster than the iPhone XS's Face ID. OnePlus says it takes 0.53 seconds for the front-facing camera to pop up and then 0.65 seconds for the phone to unlock. It definitely felt like a 1-second process. (Pro tip: Showing this feature to people is an excellent party trick.)MORE: OnePlus 7 Pro to Offer 5G, 'Breakthrough' DisplayHowever, the 7 Pro's facial recognition isn't secure enough to authenticate payments. I tried to fool the camera with a photo of myself, which didn't work. That's an improvement over the Galaxy S10, which can be easily unlocked with a photo or video of a person's face. I left both unlocking methods toggled on while testing the 7 Pro, and I almost forgot that my phone was ever locked at all — it was always open to the home screen.The 7 Pro falls short in one key way: battery life. We're beginning to expect more from flagship phones as their battery packs add more milliamps, and the OnePlus 7 Pro's 4,000 mAh battery should result in lengthy battery life. But on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network until the battery dies, the 7 Pro lasted just 9 hours and 31 minutes.The iPhone XS Max (10:38) and Galaxy S10 Plus (12:35) easily cruised past the 7 Pro. Even last year's OnePlus 6T (10:23) outlasted the 7 Pro. Google's Pixel 3 XL (9:30) was right in line with the 7 Pro, but that phone is also 9 months old and its battery life was a bit of a disappointment as well, compared with other Google phones.The 7 Pro's saving grace is OnePlus' Warp Charge 30 rapid-charging technology, which the company introduced in the 6T McLaren edition. Using the charging brick and cable included in the box, the 7 Pro juiced up from 0% to 60% in 30 minutes. After an hour, the 7 Pro was almost fully charged at 92%. I couldn't be mad.The OnePlus 7 Pro has a higher price tag than almost any other OnePlus device before it, which can be hard to stomach if you expect sub-$600 phones from OnePlus. (The arrival of the $599 OnePlus 7T, which offers some of the same features as the 7 Pro, takes some of the sting away.

108,Samsung Galaxy S10e,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/galaxy-s10e,"The Samsung Galaxy S10e delivers a premium experience for less money than you might expect, which is why it was one of our picks for the best Android phones out there. Of course now, it's been supplanted by newer devices. Regardless, you get a vivid 5.8-inch OLED display and a powerful Snapdragon 855 processor in compact design that's easy to use with one hand.The Galaxy S10e includes dual rear cameras instead of the triple-lens arrangement found on the pricier S10 models, and lacks an in-display fingerprint sensor. But this is not a 'lite' device by any stretch. For the money, the S10e is still a good phone, even if it is getting a bit long in the tooth.Now that the Galaxy S21 series has launched, the Samsung Galaxy S10e starts at $599 at Verizon, and for that you get 128GB of onboard storage and 6GB of RAM.  Before the Galaxy S20 lineup came along, Samsung sold the S10e for $749, so that's quite the price drop, and you can save even more with eligible trade-ins at Samsung. You also might be able to find it for even cheaper on certain retailers, though stock is limited since the phone is from 2019.This is one of the least expensive flagship phones you can get, though Apple offers the iPhone 11 for $699, and OnePlus continues to produce low-cost Android flagships like the $599 OnePlus 7T that compares quite favorably to the Galaxy S10 lineup (check out our OnePlus 7T vs Galaxy S10 comparison for more on that).And it should be obvious, but high-end phones from 2020 will provide better performance. For example, the iPhone 12 mini costs just $699 and offers 5G and a whole host of improvements. If you want to stick with Android, Google has you covered with the Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a 5G, and Pixel 5, all of which hit different price points and provide experiences similar to, or better than, the Galaxy S10e.Even a year after it came out, the cheapest Galaxy S10 is also the smallest. At 5.8 inches, the S10e is tiny by modern standards. It's even smaller than the 5.5-inch Google Pixel 3, though because of the Galaxy's near-complete lack of bezels and placement of the front-facing camera inside the display, the S10e's screen manages to be slightly larger than that of Google's 2018 flagship. It's more akin to the Pixel 4a, since both offer very slim bezels and hole punch front cameras in small packages.While the S10e carves a considerably smaller footprint than the other S10 models, it echoes the same aesthetics. The S10e's mirrored aluminum frame is sandwiched between two slabs of Gorilla Glass. The display glass is flat, while the back is subtly curved to provide comfortable grip. And on the bottom, you'll find a headphone jack — an increasingly rare and valuable feature among today's top smartphones.Although the S10e's Infinity-O camera-in-display may be off-putting to some (I find it less egregious than the notch), there's a lot to like about the S10e's design. None of the fit and finish of the S10 and S10 Plus has been sacrificed in this entry-level Galaxy; the S10e feels like a premium product, only smaller. And the right customers will see its more pocketable and compact dimensions as a massive boon in an era of ever-growing flagships. Think less iPhone 11, more iPhone SE.Size aside, the S10e's most notable deviation from the other models is its side-mounted fingerprint sensor. Samsung opted against using the in-display ultrasonic solution found in the S10 and S10 Plus, presumably to keep costs down. That's not necessarily a bad thing.While the S10e's approach works as well as any conventional scanner, in practice it can be hard to locate, because the depression of the power key within the frame isn't well pronounced. This led to many failed presses initially, with the phone constantly reminding me to cover the entire button when applying my prints. Once I established muscle memory for the proper location, though, the success rate significantly improved.People will love the S10e's pocketable size in an era of larger and larger flagship phones. Think less iPhone XR, more iPhone SE.The S10e can also be quite a colorful phone, if you want it to be. There's a rainbow of Galaxy S10 Colors available, from vivacious Flamingo Pink to the stunning, pearl-like Prism White of our review unit. However, in true Apple fashion, the cheapest version of the S10 line gets some exclusive livelier flavors as well, like the invigorating Canary Yellow and the opulent Prism Green (neither of which is available for U.S. customers, unfortunately).The Galaxy S10e's 5.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display isn't quite as sharp as the QHD screens inside the larger S10 variants. However, because of the smaller proportions, everything still looks crisp, with no loss of quality at oblique viewing angles, and none of that dithered paper-like texture you sometimes get from poor-quality OLED panels.Samsung's displays are unmatched in the space, and the S10e demonstrates why. With a peak brightness of 603 nits, the S10e blows away the 403-nit Pixel 3, equals the Galaxy S9 and is imperceptibly dimmer than the iPhone XS at 611 nits. Phones released since the S10e came out, including the iPhone 11 and Samsung's own Galaxy Note 10, are even brighter, though you won't have to squint to see the S10e's screen. That makes the tiny Galaxy handset perfect for outdoor use, even when the sun's beaming down on it.In a departure from previous Galaxy handsets, the S10e ships in a default state to a Natural color mode, which is more realistic and less saturated than the old Dynamic preset. That makes it punchier than the basic sRGB color space, and at least to my eyes, strikes closer to the DCI-P3 cinema spec, much like Apple's iPhones.In this default state, the S10e covers 148 percent of the sRGB space. That's ahead of the iPhone XS' 123 percent, and those who prefer perkier colors shouldn't fear, as Samsung has included a Vivid option with the S10e that ratchets up those hues into the stratosphere. And no matter what profile you use, the S10e's screen comes HDR10+ certified for excellent contrast and visibility in shadows and highlights alike.MORE: Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus ReviewThe S10e's Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.57 is a bit higher than what we've observed from other flagships, like the iPhone XS and Pixel 3 at 0.22 and 0.44, respectively. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) Those results shouldn't faze you, though, as the S10e's panel still dazzles as well as any Samsung has ever produced. Watching Amazon's The Grand Tour on the small screen, I was mesmerized by the electric blue of Abbie Eaton's Porsche as she drifted it across a snow-blanketed meadow.The Samsung Galaxy S10e packs two cameras on the back — one 12-megapixel primary sensor with a variable aperture of either ƒ/1.5 or ƒ/2.4, and another 16-megapixel sensor mated to an ultrawide lens with a 123-degree field of view. On the front is a 10-megapixel, ƒ/1.9 lens.All of those cameras are also present in the S10 and S10 Plus, though those phones add a telephoto lens to the back as well with 2x optical zoom, which the S10e lacks. The S10 Plus also has a secondary depth sensor on the front of the device for more accurate bokeh effects in selfies.The S10e's cameras aren't lacking in bells and whistles — which makes it all the more disappointing that the shots they produce are surprisingly inconsistent.Still, with its dual rear cameras and bevy of creative shooting modes, the S10e is hardly under-equipped when it comes to photography tools. Samsung has pumped up its shallow depth-of-field Live Focus mode with stylish effects so you can add a dash of partial color or change the direction and pattern of the background blur after the fact. And the company's AI-based Scene Optimizer tech, which tunes settings based on subjects the camera identifies, can recognize 10 more scenes for a total of 30.So it's clear the S10e's cameras aren't lacking in bells and whistles, then. And yet, the types of shots they produce are surprisingly inconsistent. Although the S10e's photography is solid across the board, there were almost always one or two missteps in every picture we took with the phone that held it back.Take these shots inside a bar, for example. The Pixel 3 delivers a balanced photo with minimal noise, good white balance and sharp details. And almost none of those qualities came through in the S10e's attempt. I could live with most of the S10e's shortcomings here, but the yellow cast that pervades the frame is far too off-putting to make the image usable without some editing.A similar story played out when we photographed a box of cupcakes. The S10e's food Scene Optimizer mode boosted the exposure and warmth of the scene far beyond what was necessary. The iPhone XS' attempt is simply more grounded in reality and also more precise, especially as you peer into the details, like the icing's texture.Outside the iconic New York Public Library, the S10e clawed some favor back with this picturesque city scene. Samsung's software still dialed up the contrast and exposure to a level that will likely bother those who prefer more realistic shots, and the white balance is again a bit off (this time, it swings too far in the cool direction).MORE: Galaxy S10 vs Pixel 3 Camera Shootout: Which Phone Wins?However, there's a drama to the S10e's interpretation that the iPhone XS lacks, and if you were going to apply an artsy filter to either of these photos, you'd probably have to do less with what the S10e gives you.I wish I could say the same about the S10e's portraits, but it seems Samsung still hasn't addressed the overall cloudiness of the photos its Live Focus feature produces. The S10e opts for a wider field-of-view with these kinds of shots than most other flagships, like the Pixel 3. And in the process, some detail is definitely lost; the S10e glosses over the texture of my skin and the fabric of my sweater, and struggles to determine the boundary of the foreground in the lower left corner of the frame.One of the new Scene Optimizer modes introduced with the S10e is called Bright Night. Like Google's Night Sight feature in the Pixel 3, it's designed to improve visibility in super-low-light shooting conditions. At launch, however, Samsung is not allowing you to manually activate Bright Night; rather, it appears automatically in the appropriate conditions in the form of a moon icon, and you can turn it off with a tap. Samsung is reportedly changing this behavior in a future update.Usability quirks aside, Bright Night doesn't quite rise to the level of Google's Night Sight. Putting aside some of the compositional differences between these photos, the Night Sight result is better all around, with more definition in the shadows, stronger color throughout and properly exposed highlights, especially pertaining to the ice patch on the road.The S10e's 10-megapixel front-facing shooter doesn't impress, either. It delivered a washed out selfie that also wasn't quite as sharp as the Pixel 3's, even though no softening or beautification filters were applied in either case.Smartphone cameras have only improved since the Galaxy S10e's spring release. Both the iPhone 12 Pro Max and Pixel 5 have come out since then and have raised the bar even further for mobile photography. The Galaxy S10e has a fine camera, but there are better options out there – see our rundown of the best camera phones for our top picks.The S10e especially shines when gaming. Playing PUBG Mobile at fully maxed settings was no sweat at all for the phone.Armed with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 system-on-chip — in North American models, at least — the Galaxy S10e was one of the most powerful Android phones you could buy when it debuted. Despite Snapdragon 865 devices hitting the scene in 2020 and 888 phones kicking off 2021, the S10e still compares favorably to other phones of its vintage.Our review unit with 6GB of RAM topped 10,513 points on Geekbench 4, which tests overall system performance. That's much faster than any other Android we've tested, save for the Galaxy S10 Plus at 10,732. (The Plus comes with an extra 2GB of memory.)  It even blows away the OnePlus 6T McLaren with its 10GB RAM, which turned in only 8,976 with last year's Snapdragon 845 silicon. Apple's A12 Bionic-equipped iPhone XS remains the flagship phone to beat at 11,420, but rest assured — the S10e isn't going to leave you wanting for more power.The S10e especially shines when gaming. Playing PUBG Mobile at fully maxed settings was no sweat  for the phone, as the framerate never dipped noticeably throughout my session. And arcade racer Asphalt 9 Legends — one of the most demanding titles on mobile today with its extensive lighting effects, motion blur and meticulously modeled cars — ran smoother on Samsung's device than on any other smartphone I've used yet.The S10e's impressive showing on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test bore this out, with a result of 5,616. That result easily tops the iPhone XS at 4,244, demonstrating that while Apple still leads in raw processing grunt, Samsung maintains an edge in graphics.Expect fast LTE performance from the Galaxy S10. According to testing from Ookla Speedtest, the S10e averaged 49.18 Mbps, compared to just 33.17 Mbps for the iPhone XR.Samsung must have packed the Galaxy S10e to the absolute limit with battery power. At 3,100mAh, the handset's battery eclipses the 3,000mAh unit inside the Galaxy S9, even though the S9 was a slightly larger phone.The S10e also charges wirelessly at a quicker rate than any Galaxy before it, thanks to Samsung's new 12W system. However, to get those speeds now, you'll have to pick up Samsung's new $99 Wireless Charger Duo Pad.Despite the S10e's slight capacity advantage over the S9, the new handset couldn't beat its predecessor in our battery test. The S10e died after 9 hours and 41 minutes of streaming web pages using T-Mobile's LTE network, which is about an hour less than the S9's 10:52, but still better than the Pixel 3’s 8:27. The Galaxy S10 Plus, with its significantly larger 4,100mAh battery, lasted 12:35, while the Galaxy S10 (powered by a 3,400mAh battery) held out for 10:19. In other words, don't expect the battery life you get from other S10 models or from newer phones like the iPhone 11 (11:16).However, the S10e can do something most other phones can't — it can wirelessly charge your other devices. Samsung's new Wireless PowerShare feature, found across the S10 lineup, transforms the S10e into a makeshift Qi induction pad, and it's tremendously easy to use. Simply switch it on via the Quick Settings toggles, flip the phone over and rest something on top of it, like your Samsung Galaxy Buds. And if you're worried about siphoning too much juice from your phone, don't fear; PowerShare automatically turns off once the phone has 30 percent battery left.Although Samsung's new Android interface, called OneUI, is quite a striking departure from the look and feel of the software on Samsung's older Galaxy handsets from the TouchWiz era. This is definitely a good thing.Aesthetically, OneUI shares nothing with Google's design direction. The first thing you notice is the scaling — UI elements on the S10e are large and in your face by default, with big text, an emphasis on squircles and most interactions placed near the bottom of the display on every menu to maximize reachability.As a result, the S10e is easier to navigate with one hand than stock Android or iOS, which is good. But the cutesy icons and large on-screen buttons contained within the handset's tiny screen definitely has me feeling those ""my first smartphone"" vibes that Tom's Guide Editor-In-Chief Mark Spoonauer referenced in his S10 Plus review. It also doesn't help that the Infinity-O camera cutout necessitates a very thick status bar that eats into the display's real estate about as much (or possibly even more) than a notch would.The S10e is a beautiful piece of tech, and it deserves an interface that feels as futuristic and advanced as its exterior. That said, there are some things I really like about OneUI. Samsung's gesture interface is one of the simplest and cleverest I've encountered yet, as the company has just replaced Android's traditional three-button navigation bar with three zones to swipe up and trigger those same functions. And OneUI's Night Mode is not only a bit more stylish and easier on the eyes, but also saves energy, too.Samsung is rolling out its new OneUI 2.0 interface built on Android 10 to phones like the Galaxy S10e.The Samsung Galaxy S10e is a cheaper flagship phone that hits most of the same highs as its costlier siblings. You're still getting the same fantastic display, brisk performance, streamlined software and generous specs that make the S10 and S10 Plus great, only without some bells and whistles you don't really need (like the in-display fingerprint sensor).Still, the S10e isn't perfect. In a pinch I'd turn to the cameras in the Pixel 4, iPhone XS or iPhone XR every time.And those who are really conscious about battery life will likely want to spring for one of the larger S10 variants. But those phones also cost considerably more. The bottom line is that, for the price and size, the S10e is still a good little phone, but it's outmatched by newer devices, as you would expect. If you find a good deal on one, it's a decent option. Editor's note: Since publishing, the iPhone 12 series and Google's slew of new Pixels came out. Other than the physical size of the Galaxy S10e, we prefer those phones in every regard."
109,Moto G7 Power,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-g7-power,review-6340.html","The Moto G7 Power delivers two things you should care about: very long battery life and a cheap price. One of the best Android phones for the money, this $249/£180 phone boasts a high-capacity, 5,000-mAh battery. In fact, this is one of the longest running phones in the last few years.Although you have to accept some trade-offs to get those several extra hours of endurance, don't be fooled by this phone's bargain price. Although a newer Moto G Power is on the way, the Moto G7 Power is one of the best phones for those on a budget and is easily one of the best cheap phones available.Like the $299/£240 Moto G7 and $199/£130 G7 Play, the $249/£180 G7 Power is available unlocked and set up to support all wireless networks in the U.S. That includes CDMA carriers like Verizon and Sprint, as well as GSM-based ones like AT&T and T-Mobile. You can get the Moto G7 Play at Amazon and Best Buy.As of April 29, the Moto G7 Power is offered in-store at T-Mobile and the Uncarrier's prepaid subsidiary, Metro by T-Mobile. It retails for $237.50, which breaks out into $9.50 a month if you opt for an estimated installment plan over 24 months.The Moto G7 Power comes in just one color, Marine Blue, and one configuration, containing 32GB of built-in storage and 3GB of RAM. You can expand that through the use of a microSD card for up to another 512GB of space for apps, games and media.Motorola has given all of its latest G-series handsets the notch treatment. But unlike the regular Moto G7, with its teardrop design, the G7 Power adopts a more conventionally styled notch, with the earpiece and selfie camera front and center — similar to what you'd find on one of Apple's latest iPhones.The only problem with this look is that it's hardly original. Increasingly, phones have notches like the one Motorola bestowed on the G7 Power. Couple that awkward design with the G7 Power's rather noticeable bottom bezel and body clad in glossy plastic, and you're left with a phone that tries and fails to conceal its budget roots.It doesn't help that the G7 Power is also very big, with its 6.2-inch display and a slightly thicker frame to haul around that beefy, 5,000-mAh battery. There's still a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack up top so you can use a good old-fashioned pair of headphones.However, Motorola unfortunately hasn't added true IP-rated water resistance or near-field communication to any device in the G7 range, so this phone feels a bit dated, even at its low price.The G7 Power trades the 6.2-inch, full-HD+ LCD display in the regular Moto G7 for a slightly lower-resolution panel with the same dimensions. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a massive issue for such an inexpensive handset, but because the G7 Power's screen is no smaller than the G7’s, those missing pixels tend to make their presence known rather quickly.The display on this $249/£180 variant measures 1570 x 720, which translates to about 279 pixels per inch. That's great for energy efficiency but not quite so good for the appearance of on-screen content. Text and icons can't help but look a hair jagged on the G7 Power, though the farther you hold the phone away from your eyes, the less noticeable the effect.If you can see past the resolution deficit, this is still a display you'd be happy to use to watch anything.Motorola might be stretching those pixels a bit wider than we'd like, but at least the G7 Power's color reproduction and brightness didn't leave much to be desired. The handset covered 123 percent of the sRGB color space and notched a Delta-E accuracy score of 0.35 in our testing. Those are respectable numbers for a budget-priced LCD-toting smartphone. In fact, both are nearly dead-even with the pricier Moto G7 and its showings of 135 percent and 0.34, respectively. (For Delta-E, closer to zero is better.)However, the G7 Power really impressed in its brightness. At 558 nits on the max setting, this member of Motorola's midrange family totally outshone the pricier G7 and its 445 nits. All that extra light coming through the display makes a big difference outdoors on a sunny day, when dimmer screens make reading text a struggle. In those scenarios, we'd definitely rather take the Power than its siblings.And truthfully, if you can see past the resolution deficit, this is still a display you'd be happy to use to watch anything. I fired up Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse and jacked the G7 Power's color profile up to Saturated to really make those juicy comic book hues pop. The searing neon lights of Times Square were the perfect backdrop for the web slinger's antics, and as I shifted the device in my hand from side to side, those colors stayed remarkably consistent.On the back of the G7 Power is one 12-megapixel camera with an f/2.0 aperture. It's not quite the same as the f/1.8, 12-MP sensor in the regular G7, but in practice, the G7 Power produces images that are very, very similar. In fact, in the sub-$300 budget segment, it's actually the best camera phone we've tested.What G7 Power does lack, however, is a secondary 5-MP shooter to enable depth-of-field effects. However, this isn't a terribly huge absence either, because the Moto G7's shallow depth-of-field portraits and bokeh aren't all that impressive, as is the case with many other budget phones' dual-lens systems.For those reasons, I came away reasonably pleased with the G7 Power's performance against its more expensive sibling. This shot of buildings hovering over New York City's Bryant Park looks pretty much identical in the two G7 models, even though the standard G7 costs $50 more.Inside the park, the G7 Power compares favorably against one of our favorite camera phones for the money, the Nokia 7.1. Like other Motorola handsets of the past, the G7 Power does get a bit overzealous with the saturation; Bryant Park's iconic fountain isn't quite as red as the device would lead you to believe. That said, there really isn't much difference between these phones' photos, even though the Nokia 7.1 costs $100 more than the Motorola.The G7 Power really struggles in portraits and bokeh, however. Because the phone has only one rear-facing lens, the device needs to rely on software, not optics, to blur the background.Some high-end devices, like the Pixel 3 and iPhone XR, can accomplish software-based bokeh without a noticeable drop in quality. However, Motorola's computational photography isn't quite up to that level, and that leads to unwelcome artifacts and inconsistent blurring on the edges of my colleague Shaun's face. Additionally, Nokia's handset just does a much better job picking up those finer details in Shaun's face, as well as his skin tone.Finally, the G7 Power's 8-MP front-facing camera also seems pretty much the same as the one in the G7. Problem is, it's not a particularly great shooter for selfies, as its shots are often noisy and just blurry enough that they always seem slightly out of focus. The Nokia 7.1, with its impressive dynamic range, more-accurate white balance and superior sharpness, easily takes the win here.The Snapdragon 632 system-on-chip and the 3GB of RAM in the G7 Power are sufficient for ordinary duties, like web browsing, navigation and social media. Just don't expect this phone to handle demanding gamesThe G7 Power plainly wasn't up to the task when I dove into PUBG Mobile. Even on the battle-royale shooter's lowest graphical settings and with the frame rate set to prioritize smoothness over visual fidelity, the experience was still jerky, which made it difficult for me to pick off enemy combatants.  F1 Mobile Racing ran much more consistently, though again at remarkably low settings. In fact, the resolution was so low and track-side scenery and lighting were so sparse that it looked worse than a PlayStation 2 game.The culprit is the phone's Adreno 506 GPU. It's an old chip that can't keep pace with its modern contemporaries, in phones such as the Nokia 7.1. And it very clearly demonstrated its limits during 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphical benchmark, in which the G7 Power managed only 14,802. Some budget phones, including Nokia's, actually max this test.Fortunately, Geekbench 4's overall test of system performance proved to be much more the G7 Power's forte. There, the inexpensive handset delivered a score of 4,485 — nearly 400 points behind the Moto G7's mark and around 500 behind that of the pricier, more powerful, Snapdragon 636-equipped Nokia 7.1.Up to this point, the G7 Power probably seems like a totally serviceable, if uninspiring budget phone. And that conclusion would be mostly accurate; in fact, it's the same impression we came away with regarding the regular G7.The G7 Power's astonishing battery life is the primary reason to buy this phone.However, the G7 Power happens to have an ace up its sleeve — one the other Moto models don't — in its 5,000-mAh battery. And it's this battery that propelled the phone to an astonishing 15 hours and 35 minutes of endless web-page streaming over T-Mobile's LTE network in our testing. This runtime makes the Moto G7 Power the longest-lasting phone we've tested in the last two years.For those keeping count, that's 7 hours longer than the 8 hours and 50 minutes the standard G7 granted us and more than twice as long as the 7 hours and 41 minutes from the Nokia 7.1, which costs $100 more than the G7 Power. And it's that endurance — especially in an era when it seems like phones are lasting less and less time on a charge — that makes the G7 Power stand apart from the budget crowd.The G7 Power's battery life is the primary reason you should want this phone. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the amount of time it takes to top that battery back up. Even with Motorola's included TurboPower USB Type-C adapter, the G7 Power managed to get to only 29 percent capacity after 30 minutes of being plugged in.Motorola has set a precedent for supporting its handsets with a quality, pure Android experience, and the G7 Power is no different.The G7 Power ships with Android 9 Pie installed but will see one major update to Android Q over its life span. While Motorola hasn't fussed with Google's stock software experience, the manufacturer has given the G7 Power a number of extra features and shortcuts via the appropriately named Moto app.In that app, you'll find options for gesture controls, old favorites like chopping to trigger the flashlight and twisting for the camera, and the always-on Moto Display feature, which elegantly serves up notifications and alerts even while the phone is in a low-power, sleep state. Moto Display was one of the first always-on interfaces on a smartphone, and even though it hasn't really changed in years, it's still just as convenient and useful today.The G7 Power is not a flashy device. For the most part, it's a fine option for a cheap phone, with performance that's serviceable (so long as you don't game) and a software experience and selection of features that are among the finest in its class.For $249/£180, that's fine. But the G7 Power stands apart in one big way: battery life. It's this handset's claim to fame, and it's a factor that shouldn't be overlooked. Consider that the $299/£240 Moto G7 really struggled with longevity on a charge and that for $50 less, the G7 Power provides an alternative that is almost the same in every way that matters while also lasting a lot longer on a charge.For my money, I'd skip the regular G7's frivolous features, save $50 and go for the G7 Power. The peace of mind of having a phone that lasts an eternity is worth it. While the Nokia 7.1 offers a more premium design and better camera if you have more to spend, anyone chiefly concerned about battery life and looking for a device under $300 needn't look further than the G7 Power.Credit: Tom's Guide"
110,Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-lite,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite is designed to deliver a big-screen phone without the big price tag of the Galaxy Note 10, giving Samsung a direct competitor to the likes of the Google Pixel 3a XL (and the eventual Google Pixel 4a XL). While we're not sure how much this 6.7-inch phone will cost, the Note 10 Lite offers plenty of features to love.We'll need to spend more time with the phone to produce a definitive Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite review and determine if this is one of the best phones for the money, but we did get some hands-on time with the phablet that allowed us to form some initial impressions. For a closer look at this phone differs from Samsung's regular phablet, check out our Galaxy Note 10 Lite vs. Galaxy Note 10 comparison.While we know a lot about the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite's design, cameras and specs, we don't know when it will go on sale or how much it will cost. We're actually not even sure this (presumably) more affordable flagship will be available in the U.S. Samsung put its own Exynos chip in the Note 10 Lite, which means it's likely the phone won't be available in North America.Also, since previewing the Galaxy Note 10 Lite at CES earlier this year, Samsung has introduced the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus and Galaxy S20 Ultra. Samsung seems much more focused on promoting those new phones, but since they are all 5G-capable devices, the Galaxy Note 10 Lite could be Samsung's less expensive alternative for people who still connect primarily via LTE.The 6.7-inch Galaxy Note 10 Lite sports a gigantic Super AMOLED, Infinity-O display with a camera cut-out directly in top center of the device. The screen is beautiful, as Samsung's displays always are, and it's larger than the 6.3-inch Galaxy Note 10.The Lite comes in three shades: Aura Glow, Aura Black and Aura Red. The red hue I tested in person is particularly fetching; the black is a fingerprint magnet that you could probably skip.The Note 10 Lite also has a headphone jack, if that's a thing that's still important to you, and an S Pen, in keeping with the Note lineup's reason for existing.The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite's cameras are pretty standard for a flagship smartphone. The phone sports three lenses: an ultra-wide (12-MP), wide-angle (12-MP) and telephoto (12-MP). On the Note 10, the ultra-wide is 16-MP.In an interesting twist, Samsung completely redesigned the rear camera array, which is now placed in a square patch to match the Google Pixel 4 and Apple's iPhone 11 Pro. There seems to be no rhyme or reason behind that decision, but, why not? (Insert shrug emoji here.)The Galaxy Note 10 Lite sports a gigantic 4,500 mAh battery, far larger than the Galaxy Note 10's 3,500 mAh pack. The Note 10 lasted just 9:25 on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, so hopefully the Note 10 Lite easily surpasses that.Samsung put its in-house Exynos processor in the Note 10 Lite, and it's unclear whether that means the newer, more affordable model will have any performance gains over the Note 10, which is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 chipset.The Galaxy Note 10 Lite offers 6GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, well below the 12GB of RAM you can upgrade to in the higher-end Note. The Note 10 also offers 256GB of storage by default, so the Note 10 Lite isn't quite the productivity-focused powerhouse that its more expensive sibling is.There's a lot to love about the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Lite. The Aura Red shade is something to behold, and the screen is massive (and beautiful). If the price is right, this phone might be worth buying. Samsung made a few curious decisions (the camera patch, Exynos processor) that have us scratching our heads.  Now it kind of looks like a gigantic Pixel that also happens to have a stylus.Stay tuned to see if the Galaxy Note 10 Lite is worth buying."
111,Samsung Galaxy Fold,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-fold,"The Samsung Galaxy Fold is a phone that elicits mixed emotions. On the one hand, there’s the sheer wonder and excitement of holding a foldable phone — and seeing it transform from a 4.6-inch handset to a 7.3-inch tablet and back again. That excitement continues when you see an app that's running on the front screen instantly pop up on the larger display, and when you start running three apps at once on the bigger canvas.The other emotion is trepidation. Even though Samsung has made several enhancements to make the Galaxy Fold more durable since it delayed the device’s launch, the company strongly suggests that you use a light touch when pressing on the display. Then there’s the emotional sticker shock when you realize that this phone costs nearly $2,000. As I used the device for this Samsung Galaxy Fold review, I vacillated between all of these emotions – and kept coming back to a single question: Who is the Galaxy Fold made for? The answer is: Very brave and very well-off early adopters who are willing to live with a product that feels like a refined prototype.Starting Price: $1,980 OS: Android 9.9 with One UI CPU: Snapdragon 855 RAM: 12GB Storage: 512GB External display (closed): 4.6 inches (HD+) Main display: 7.3 inches (QXGA+) Rear cameras: 12-MP wide-angle (f/1.5 to f/2.4); 12-MP telephoto (f/2.4); 16-MP ultra-wide (f/2.2) Front camera (closed): 10-MP selfie (f/2.2) Front camera (open): 10-MP selfie (f/2.2); 8-MP RGB depth (f/1.9) Fingerprint sensor: Bixby button Colors: Space Silver, Cosmos Black Battery: 4,380 mAh Battery Life: 10:01 Size: 6.3 x 2.5 x 0.66 inches (62.9 x 160.9 x 17mm) Weight: 9.48 ouncesThe Samsung Galaxy Fold went on sale through AT&T and Best Buy on Sept. 27, as well as through Samsung.com.The Fold is one of the most expensive phones ever. It costs $1,980 in the U.S. and £1,800 in the U.K. (€2,000, $2,214), or about double the price of most premium flagships. (For context, the Galaxy S10 Plus starts at $999, and you can get a model with 1TB of storage and 12GB of RAM for $1,599. The iPhone 11 Pro Max with 512GB of storage costs $1,449. In essence, you’re paying about a $380 to $530 premium for the Fold’s ability to fold.For those scoring at home, the Fold would cost you $66 per month, at least if you pay off your phone in 30 months using one of AT&T's Next plans. Even though this is my second go-around with the Samsung Galaxy Fold, there’s still a real Wow factor to this device. Thanks to a sophisticated, 20-part, dual-axis hinge, you can open this clamshell just like a book, transforming the Fold from phone to tablet mode.The motion is fairly smooth and natural; I’ll admit I felt a bit like a secret agent as I used the Fold in public, surfing the web or watching a video and then closing the whole thing up before I walked away. But I also felt nervous that someone might try to steal the device from me.It's worth noting that the main display is plastic, not Gorilla Glass, like the outer cover display. But Samsung has fortified the larger panel by placing a metal layer beneath the screen. (See more on the Galaxy Fold’s durability below).When closed, the Galaxy Fold feels like a throwback phone, and a chunky one at that. It’s quite tall and narrow, and 0.66 inches thick. That’s about double the thickness of the Galaxy S10 and iPhone 11 Pro Max. This size was not optimal for the front pocket of my pants; it’s a better fit for a blazer pocket or a purse.The Galaxy Fold weighs a hefty 9.5 ounces, compared to 7.97 ounces for the iPhone 11 Pro Max and 6.9 ounces for the Galaxy Note 10 Plus. And I felt this weight strain my hands and forearms a bit when playing games for more than 10 minutes at a time; but if you’re watching a movie or TV show, you can lean the Fold on your lap.I’m not a fan of the Galaxy Fold’s button layout: Samsung decided to separate the power button and fingerprint reader on the right edge of the Galaxy Fold. It would have made more sense to combine them, which would have enabled users to power on and unlock in one fluid motion. Instead, the fingerprint sensor doubles as the Bixby button, which you can program to open other apps, as well. Even though it’s less secure, I wound up using facial recognition to unlock the Fold because it’s simply faster.The device comes in two color options: Space Silver and Cosmos Black. That's a bummer, because Samsung was going to offer funkier colors like Astro Blue and Martian Green through its site before it redesigned the phone.The other important thing to note is that the Fold doesn’t have a headphone jack, but this isn’t a huge deal because Samsung includes wireless Galaxy Buds in the box. Samsung made several changes to the Galaxy Fold's design to address durability concerns before it launched for the public.All of these tweaks add up to a foldable that feels much closer to a $2,000 phone. Closing the phone still has a reassuring clap, like a book, and the hinge system feels pretty smooth. However, Samsung still treats this as a different class of phone when it comes to how it wants you to handle it. The company cautions that you “ use a light touch” when touching the 7.3-inch display and to keep the Fold “free of water and dust.”One reviewer from TechCrunch reported that his Galaxy Fold was damaged after one day of use. The center of the screen became pixelated with a blob, but the cause is not clear. Thus far, we have not encountered issues with our review unit.Samsung claims that the Galaxy Fold can withstand 200,000 opens.It’s best to think of the front display on the Samsung Galaxy Fold as an at-a-glance screen for quick interactions. That’s because it’s just 4.6 inches, which is Lilliputian compared to even the best small phones (typically 5.5 inches and up). Because the screen is narrow, it’s also difficult to type on.During my testing, I used the front display maybe 15% of the time, which included checking Gmail (but not responding), reading a news story with one hand while on the subway, and changing tracks on Spotify. Anything more made me feel that I needed the larger screen.The interior 7.3-inch display is where the real action is — an oversized Super Active Matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) canvas that’s sharp and colorful but with a couple of trade-offs. On the plus side, I really enjoyed watching the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker trailer; it really felt like I was using a tablet. I could even access and edit articles in our site's CMS because of how wide the display is. This is something I can’t do as easily on the 6-inch-plus-size screens of the Galaxy Note 10 and iPhone 11 Pro Max.During one commute home, I watched The Boys on the Prime Video app and felt like I had a mini movie theater in front of my eyes. If you’d rather not have big bars above and below the display you can choose which apps go full screen in the Settings app. However, the crease in the middle of the Fold’s display is noticeable when you use apps with a white background, such as Chrome and Gmail. It’s not ugly, just distracting. And you can feel the crease when you’re using various apps. The good news is that the crease isn’t as noticeable when viewing head-on movies, photos or anything with lots of colors.On our testing, the Galaxy Fold’s display averaged 525 nits of brightness, which is not as bright as the Galaxy Note 10 Plus (686 nits) and nowhere near as bright as the iPhone 11 Pro Max (761 nits). The OLED panel on the Fold of the color gamut registered 124.8% of the sRGB color gamut in Natural mode, which is about the same as the Galaxy Note 10 Plus and a bit higher than the iPhone 11 Pro Max (118.6%).The notch in the top right corner of the display can cut off videos should you decide to watch in full-screen mode; you can hide this notch by turning on an option in Software, but this just creates a black bar across the top of the screen.My bigger problem with the Fold’s notch is that you can’t swipe down from the right side of the screen to reveal your notifications and quick settings. Instead, I had to shift my finger toward the middle of the display. However, you can also use the fingerprint sensor to open and close the notification shade with a swipe down and up. To make the most of its foldable design, Samsung worked with Google to devise a couple of clever software features. The first is App Continuity, which enables you to open an app on the cover display and then have the app immediately fill the larger screen when you unfold the phone.One of the coolest features of the Galaxy Fold is App Continuity. If you're using an app like Google Maps on the front screen, you can open the display and it will instantly fill the larger display. This feature worked really well in my testing, with most apps popping up instantly.But you will need to tweak a setting if you want a given app to keep running on the small screen when you close the phone again.The other handy feature is Multi Active Window, which allows you to run up to three apps at once on the Galaxy Fold’s large display. You swipe in from the right side of the screen to open additional apps, and can also easily resize the apps and move them around with your finger.A decent number of third-party apps already support this multitasking mode, such as Spotify and Slack, but I noticed that Skype does not. It will take time for more developers to update their software for foldable phones like this.By default, the big-screen keyboard offers a split layout to speedup thumb typing on such a large canvas, but I found myself switching to a regular layout because it felt like less work. No matter which mode you choose, swipe typing is supported.If you’re not a fan of carrier bloatware, I recommend that you buy the unlocked version of the Galaxy Fold. The AT&T model I reviewed had 19 apps from AT&T and AT&T-owned brands, including everything from DriveMode and Visual Voicemail to Bleacher Report and AT&T TV. I would prefer a much cleaner canvas for a $2,000 smartphone and I think Fold owners would, too.Having six cameras on a phone seems like overkill, but it isn’t given the Samsung Galaxy Fold’s unique design. Just like the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 10, there’s three shooters on the back of the Galaxy Fold: a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 16-MP ultra-wide lens and a 12-MP telephoto lens.Up front – when the Fold is closed – there’s a 10-MP camera for selfies. And when unfolded, the Galaxy Fold has another 10-MP main camera plus an 8-MP depth camera for portraits.Shooting with the Fold closed feels borderline sneaky because it’s so compact. You just double press the power button and start firing away. It’s particularly good for selfies, as you don’t have to stretch your thumb far at all to shoot.The problem is that the 4.6-inch screen is pretty small for framing shots; I found myself using the larger 7.3-inch panel when I wanted to make sure that I liked what I was capturing. Surprisingly, I didn’t find shooting with a tablet-size display in front of my face embarrassing, which is probably due to the small bezels around the screen. But, in this mode, it is a two-handed affair.The Galaxy Fold is capable of delivering gorgeous photos with saturated color and a stunning amount of detail, as evidenced by this flower close-up. The rich purple really shines through, and the veins in the petals are well defined.I also had fun playing with the multiple lenses in Times Square. The standard wide-angle camera captured the myriad signs with crisp detail, and I could easily make out details on the signs as I zoomed in. The wide-angle shot resulted in a noticeable fish-eye effect toward the edges, but it got a lot more of the surrounding buildings into the frame.Like the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10, the Galaxy Fold comes with artistic new Live Focus modes, including spin bokeh, zoom bokeh and color print. I especially like the latter option, as it colorizes the main subject while leaving everything else black and white.However, the Fold fell flat compared with the iPhone 11 Pro Max in this portrait of my two colleagues, Henry and Kate. The camera washed out both of the subjects’ faces and made Henry’s jeans look like pants. Adam Ismail, who reviews lots of phones for Tom’s Guide, said of the Fold’s shot that Henry and Kate looked like they needed medical attention. You can also make out more texture and details in Kate’s shirt on the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s shot.The Galaxy Fold also offers a dedicated Night mode, which I put up against the Night mode of the iPhone 11 Pro Max. When I snapped a photo outside around 7:30 p.m. in almost complete darkness, the Fold produced a brighter image, as you can make out more of the tree in the foreground. The iPhone 11 Pro Max’s shot also has more of an orange cast to it, especially in the street, it's image also provides better contrast in the bricks and better detail.The front camera on the Galaxy Fold can take sharp selfies. There’s a fair amount of detail here in my hair and in the folds in my shirt.The Samsung Galaxy Fold is a very capable phone when it comes to shooting video. It can record in 4K at up to 60 frames per second. And the device can shoot super steady video when you press the hand icon in the camera app. In our footage shot near Bryant Park, the Galaxy Fold kept stead as I walked, but the camera had some trouble with the bright sunlight, as some faces looked washed out. However, the fountain looked pretty sharp, and the Fold did a good job rendering the surrounding buildings when I activated the ultra-wide camera.When I engaged the telephoto lens on the Fold to shoot a nearby Le Pain Quotidien, I could make out small details like the Pick Up Here sign.Given that the Samsung Galaxy Fold has the same Snapdragon 855 processor as the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 line of phones, it’s not a surprise that it offers comparable performance. The main difference is the whopping 12GB of RAM included in the Fold, which did seem to help juggle having multiple apps open on screen at once. I didn’t notice much lag as I ran three apps simultaneously.On Geekbench 5, a relatively new benchmark that measures overall performance, the Galaxy Fold scored 728 on the single-core portion of the test and 2,619 on the multi-core portion. The Galaxy Note 10 Plus scored 736 and 2,691 respectively, which is pretty much identical, while the OnePlus 7T scored a slightly higher 744 and 2,802. The iPhone 11 Pro Max blew away the field with a single-core mark of 1,334 and a multi-core score of 3,517. We'll be running additional tests throughout our time with the device.To gauge graphics performance on the Galaxy Fold, we ran GFXBench; the phone turned in a score 1,038 frames on the high-tier version of the Aztec Ruins Vulkan test (offscreen). The iPhone 11 Pro max notched a higher number – 1,657 frames.With a 4,380 mAh battery, the Samsung Galaxy Fold has pretty good staying power given its huge display, but other phones last longer on a charge. On the Tom's Guide battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over 4G LTE (we used AT&T's network) at 150 nits of screen brightness, the Galaxy Fold's battery lasted 10 hours and 1 minute.This runtime is pretty good when you consider that we used the larger 7.3-inch display for the entire duration of this test. (We will be retesting where we use the smaller front display for a quarter of the time.) By comparison, the Galaxy Note 10 Plus lasted an average of 11:09 on our test, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max averaged 11:54.On a day with intermittent usage, which included snapping photos, streaming music, watching video clips and checking email, the phone still had 60% capacity left at 9:15 p.m; I had unplugged the phone at 6:30 a.m.On a day when I used the Galaxy Fold more heavily, which included watching two full TV episodes on Netflix, the Fold was down to 25% come 9 p.m. That’s still more than a full day’s worth of endurance. I loved being able to fire up the Wireless PowerShare feature on the Galaxy Fold, which allows you to charge other phones and accessories by simply placing them on the back of the Samsung handset. This includes the wireless Galaxy Buds, which Samsung throws in for the $1,980 price.The Galaxy Fold feels like a phone from the future, and yet from a practical perspective it falls a bit short. When I was using Slack in one window, Gmail in another and Spotify in yet another on the 7.3-inch screen, I could see myself using my laptop less and a device like this more. I also liked being able to review and edit large documents on the go. And it’s just cool to close the whole thing up when you’re ready to walk way. But that doesn’t mean you should invest $2,000 of your own money. Even if you put aside the lingering durability concerns around the Galaxy Fold, I find the overall design bulky and heavy, and the front display is too small. And while the cameras are solid, the iPhone 11 Pro has leapt ahead with its better HDR and night mode.So as much as I appreciate what Samsung has accomplished with this first-generation foldable phone, I would suggest that most people wait for the sequel and for other foldables to hit the market before they take the foldable plunge."
112,Motorola Razr (2019),Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-razr,"The Motorola Razr is not the phone that will make foldable phones catch on. Motorola’s phones were the epitome of cool during the mid-aughts, and the company has found an admittedly cheeky way to honor that design in its first-ever foldable. You get a 6.2 inch display when you want it and a compact clamshell when you're on the move.However, between the Razr’s questionable build quality, underwhelming performance, middling camera and awful battery life, the folding trick — neat as it may be — isn’t enough to save this device or make it worthy of our best phones list.Our Motorola Razr review will tell you everything you need to know about this bold but misguided foldable.The Razr costs $1,500 and is available now through Verizon, Walmart and Motorola's online store. At Verizon, you can pay off the phone in monthly installments, which breaks out to $62.49 per month over 24 months.Verizon is also offering a deal on the Razr that could save you a substantial amount of money if you're switching to Big Red from another carrier. Trade in an eligible phone, and you can get up to $500 in bill credits on the Razr (again, spread out over 24 months); you'll get another $200 in the form of a prepaid Mastercard for switching to Verizon. Current Verizon customers can get up to $300 in bill credits for their trade-in toward a new Razr.Like the original Razr, the new model is a flip phone that folds vertically. Unlike the original Razr, however, the entirety of the inside of this device is dominated by a flexible plastic display.The footprint vaguely resembles the Razr of old, with its rounded edges and thick chin on the bottom; it’s only when you place the new model side-by-side with its predecessor that you realize how much squatter and thicker the reimagined Razr is.But there are similarities if you know where to look. The latest Razr has a touch-sensitive Quick View OLED display on the exterior, right above the lone camera lens, that evokes the secondary screen on the original. The bulk of the matte black exterior is made from polycarbonate just like it was in the old days, and it doesn’t feel good — it’s tacky to the touch, and the textured back is a magnet for fingerprints in the worst way.And you’ll be touching this portion of the Razr quite a lot, both because the chin helps balance the device in your hand and because it houses the phone’s capacitive fingerprint sensor and a bottom-firing speaker that’s quite tinny, but gets louder than you’d expect.When the Razr is unfolded, it’s 6.77 inches tall; when folded, it packs down to a height of 3.7 inches, which makes it far more pocketable than just about any smartphone, save for the oft-maligned Palm. Those with tight pockets or small hands are going to love this about the Razr; it harks back to a time when technology was celebrated for being compact, efficient and accommodating to your life — not the other way around.Well, at least until you try to open it. Motorola is very proud of the Razr’s hinge — the company says it took four years to develop, and went through 26 revisions before they settled on the final design. The problem is, it’s quite stiff; so stiff, in fact, that it’s not the easiest to flip with one thumb alone. You can do it, but during my time with the device I often worried about scratching the screen with my fingernail, or using so much force that it would cause the phone to slip out of my grasp. And while the old Razr could be described as a tank, you definitely wouldn’t want to risk dropping the new one.There’s another issue with the hinge that presents itself when shutting the device: a noticeable gap that reveals itself mid-close, where the flexible display actually lifts up from the chassis. The opening is so large, you could easily look through it and see out the other side, which doesn’t instill much confidence. Luckily, whatever debris that might have slipped into that aperture as I used it didn’t cause any noticeable problems, though I’d be curious to see if that remains the case over the long term.And, yes, we must talk about the sound. There's a faint creaking that rears its head when you open or shut the phone. On one hand, the concern seems a bit overblown; the sound isn’t that loud (you’d probably only notice it in silence), and Motorola says that the noise is “intrinsic to the mechanical movement of the phone” and “in no way affects the quality of the product.”We can't confirm with certainty that the Razr will withstand the rigors of everyday life.This is no simple hinge; it’s a complex array of many moving parts, including sliding support plates that physically move the display downward when closing the phone. Keeping that in mind, I can live with a seemingly inconsequential sound as a tradeoff for this mini miracle.That said, I also understand the criticism. When you spend $1,500 on a piece of technology, you don’t want to believe you’re slowly destroying your investment simply by using it every day. It’s disconcerting to hear, and again, we don’t know how it’ll change with time. For what it’s worth, the Razr’s standard one-year warranty will cover screen replacements, and if a new screen is needed outside of the warranty, it will cost $299, or 20% of the cost of the phone itself.Still, we must add that Motorola has given us only a week with our loaner before requiring us to ship it back, which is a shorter time than most review terms. That doesn’t allow us to confirm with certainty that the Razr will withstand the rigors of everyday life.The Razr has two displays: a 6.2-inch, 21:9 plastic OLED panel on the inside with HD resolution (you read that right; no full-HD for this pricey foldable) as well as the aforementioned 2.7-inch, 4:3 OLED panel on the outside, which serves up notifications, quick toggles, and serves as a viewfinder when snapping a selfie while the device is closed.Having a 6.2-inch display on a device that you could easily forget is in your pocket is a pretty great perk, but the screen itself exhibits some of those classic foldable characteristics. The plastic screen is not anywhere near as smooth and consistent as glass; there are horizontal creases cutting across the regions that bend, which you sometimes notice when the display is outstretched. Whatever film is protecting the panel lends an orange peel-esque iridescence under bright indoor light. Motorola says “bumps and lumps are normal,” and you’ll certainly feel them when scrolling. Our unit has a circular depression right in the center of the top half, and whenever I ran my index finger over that divot, it was never a great feeling.The screen also doesn’t lie totally flat when unfolded. It gets close, but there’s always the slightest hint of an angle, which is hard to ignore when you’re holding the Razr vertically and reading a webpage, though a bit easier to forget about when cradling the device with two hands to play a game. As far as colors and display quality is concerned, the Razr’s main screen is serviceable across the board, with surprisingly decent viewability from off-center angles and robust color, especially when set to the default Saturated profile. Under our light meter, the Razr’s screen notched an sRGB coverage score of 203.2%, indicating very pronounced hues compared to the Pixel 4 (130.1%) and the iPhone 11 Pro (118.6%). If that color is a bit too loud for your liking, you can always select a more muted palette in the settings. The screen is far from perfect, however. At a peak brightness of just 386 nits, the Razr’s screen is far too dim compared to leading flagships from Apple and Samsung, which routinely achieve nearly twice that these days.What’s more, the resolution hit is unfortunate. Watching a trailer for the upcoming Fast & Furious movie was immersive enough thanks to that 21:9 aspect ratio, but the HD resolution made the mess of explosions and death-defying stunt driving feats all just one big blur. YouTube, like many media apps, gives you the option of pinching to expand content so that it fills your device’s panel, but this simply compounds the problem and further softens visuals. I instinctively kept trying to raise the trailer’s resolution to 1080p, but 720p is the best the Razr can manage.This screen is much better suited for surfing the web and scrolling through social media apps, where you can really take advantage of those extra-tall proportions. You can see so much more content at any given time, and the height of the panel also lends valuable extra space while messaging or emailing, as you’re typing on the keyboard.You’ll find but two cameras on the new Razr — a single-lens exterior shooter tied to a 16-megapixel sensor, and a 5-MP front-facing camera concealed in a notch inside that also houses the earpiece.The Razr’s unique form factor means that the 16-MP main shooter can either be used as a conventional rear camera when the device is unfolded and in use, or as a selfie cam when the phone is shut. Just twist the device twice — a common shortcut that’s appeared on a number of Motorola handsets over the years — and you’ll call up the camera, which instantly fills the Quick View display with a little viewfinder, so you can quickly immerse yourself in your surroundings and return to your business. Alternatively, you can open the phone at that point and the main display will preemptively open the camera app, saving you a step.Those are nice conveniences but unfortunately they don’t save the fact that the Razr’s cameras are not great. This shot of New York’s Bryant Park captured on a cold and rainy day highlights the deficiencies with the main shooters in Motorola’s first foldable, especially compared to the same scene as viewed through the lens of the Pixel 4. Google’s handset is clearly so much more adept at handling intense sources of light, be it the overcast sky above or the street lamps below. It’s also hard to overlook the red tint pervading everything on the Razr’s rendition. The story gets worse for the Razr indoors, as this coffee shop photo op depicts. In fairness, there’s a degree of smokiness in the center of the frame of the shot taken by the iPhone 11 Pro; at the same time, however, the iPhone is at least able to render the view outside, the entrance to the coffee shop, the light from the chandelier above and the carving pattern in the ceiling — all of which the Razr fails to. But nighttime is where the Razr falls the shortest. Motorola’s Night Vision mode simply doesn’t produce the clearest, crispest and most evenly-illuminated low-light shots under any circumstances — something highlighted by the iPhone 11 Pro’s attempt at this same evening Brooklyn scene. Even if we excuse the car entering from the right of the frame, the Razr’s shot is clearly impacted by camera shake, even though I was careful to take multiple shots and ensure both phones remained as still as possible. The brick texture of the buildings across the street is totally muddied by Motorola’s foldable, and the trees above are unevenly lit. The ability to use the main lens for selfies should mean you’ll get better results than you would on most phones, which use inferior sensors and optics from front-facing cameras. Instead, I’ve come away somewhat unimpressed with the Razr’s 16-MP primary camera and totally disappointed by that 5-MP front-facing lens when snapping a pair of portraits. I suspect Motorola felt it needed to supply the Razr with some kind of selfie shooter, no matter how low resolution, just so the device would have a way of conducting video calls. However, you’ll clearly never want to use that sensor for any other reason — the photos you end up with are simply too blurry and too washed out. While $1,500 may seem steep for a phone, in the new and fast moving world of foldables, it’s actually somewhat cheap, considering that the Galaxy Fold debuted last year at $1,980. And one of the most obvious ways in which Motorola has been able to keep costs down is with the Razr’s specs.Most smartphones that cost as much as the Razr come with flagship Qualcomm chipsets. For this year, that certainly figures to be the Snapdragon 865, which also supports 5G networks though it’s yet to arrive in any phones as of this writing. But the Razr doesn’t have a Snapdragon 865 — instead, it makes do with a Snapdragon 710 CPU, a step down from Qualcomm’s 8 series chipsets. You also get 6GB of RAM  on the Razr,when most Android phone makers are stuffing at least 8GB into their premium models. The Razr’s battery is quite small too, tipping the scales at just 2,510mAh.It’s for those reasons that we didn’t expect the Razr to dazzle us with its performance entering this review. And while the benchmarks more or less confirmed those suspicions, in actual use and gaming, the Razr is actually more up to the task than you’d think.Motorola is asking customers to pay $1,500 for a phone that doesn’t perform like a $1,500 phone should.I loaded up Asphalt 9: Legends — one of the most demanding titles on the Google Play Store — and ratcheted up the graphics to the highest setting. The experience wasn’t perfect, with some brief framerate hiccups here and there, and more jaggies than you’re likely to see if you ran the game on a Snapdragon 855-powered handset. That said, the game was still very playable, and I was able to finish atop the podium in a few races.So while the numbers paint a depressing picture for the Razr — especially compared to any other phone you might spend upward of $1,000 on — they’re not necessarily a death sentence. In Geekbench 5, which evaluates overall system performance, the Razr delivered a multi-core score of 1,406; 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme graphics gauntlet produced a score of 1,857. Not surprisingly, that’s a long ways from other premium offerings: The OnePlus 7T, which costs just $599 — less than half the price of the Razr — achieved 2,759 in Geekbench, while the $1,099 Galaxy Note 10 Plus (5,781) and $999 iPhone 11 Pro (6,163) shamed it in 3DMark’s test.So no — the Razr will not give you the power you’re paying for. Granted, I understand why Motorola chose the 710 chip for this phone. It had to save costs somewhere, and scaling back the processor may have actually been the best decision, given that most people probably don’t need all the grunt that a Snapdragon 855 or A13 Bionic chip provides. However, from the standpoint of a consumer, that’s not really your problem. At the end of the day, Razr buyers will pay $1,500 for a phone that doesn’t perform like a $1,500 phone should, and that is concerning.One look at the Razr, and you’ll find there aren’t many places for Motorola to have stored the battery in this phone. When unfolded, the handset is less than three-tenths of an inch thick (excluding the chin, of course) which means this little folding marvel is incapable of storing all that much juice.And so the Razr makes do with just a 2,510mAh battery, which happens to be quite small given the size of its display. The 6.4-inch Galaxy S10 Plus has a 4,100mAh power pack; and the 6.5-inch OnePlus 7T’s weighs in at 3,800mAh. Even the diminutive Pixel 4, with its 5.7-inch screen, has a 2,800mAh battery.The Snapdragon 710 is a chip designed more for efficiency than performance, so you’d think that might work to the Razr’s advantage. Nevertheless, our testing confirmed our worst suspicions. Motorola’s foldable lasted an average of 6 hours and 8 minutes between two sessions of Tom’s Guide’s custom battery test, where devices endlessly load webpages while set to 150 nits of brightness, over 4G LTE until the phone runs completely out of juice.The phones with the best battery life last 11 to 12 hours on a charge, so the Razr offers about half the endurance of what we would want from a phone at this price.By comparison, the Pixel 4’s battery clocked in at 8:03, which is about 2 hours less than the smartphones average. The Galaxy S10 Plus (12:35) and the iPhone 11 (11:16) also lasted a lot longer. Ironically enough, Motorola’s $249 Moto G7 Power ran for nearly three times longer than the Razr did, totaling 15 hours and 35 minutes, even though you could buy six of them for the price of this foldable.Thankfully, the Razr charges quickly with its packaged 15-watt TurboPower adapter, but then you’d expect as much because again, this phone has a very small battery. It’ll hit 43% from empty after a half hour, which is pretty good, but less impressive when you consider other phones can receive power at a much faster clip, and hit higher percentages even with significantly larger batteries. Motorola was one of the first phone makers to jump on the Qualcomm QuickCharge bandwagon almost a decade ago; what happened? Although the latest version of Google’s mobile OS, Android 10, shipped last fall, and even though Motorola’s upcoming G-series handsets already support Android 10 out of the box, the Razr comes with Android 9 Pie.That’s something you might expect from a budget or midrange mobile device — certainly not a foldable that costs $1,500, and especially when Android 10 specifically boasts improvements for devices with foldable screens. However, there are at least some clever custom software features present in the new Razr, mostly pertaining to task handoffs between the exterior and interior displays.The Retro Razr mode is an apt metaphor for the Razr as a whole — charming for about 15 minutes, but not particularly useful.For example, if you tap reply on a text or email displayed on the external screen, a notification will direct you to continue the task on the larger one. If you then open the Razr, a blank message will be waiting for you to compose. This sort of functionality works with only a limited number of apps, though Motorola says it is working with developers to expand its capabilities.Although the Quick Look display is a great idea in theory, I couldn’t help but feel that during my time with the Razr, it simply wasn’t as seamless and natural to use as it should have been. Authentication is one of the big reasons why. The Razr has that aforementioned fingerprint sensor and a rudimentary 2D facial recognition, which cleverly works through the exterior camera that faces you when the phone is closed.That’s all well and good, but for some reason, the phone still requires you to swipe up on the Quick Look screen to unlock, even if you’re already pointing it at your face. To make matters worse, the swipe up gesture is remarkably hard to get right on this tiny screen. You’d think a swipe in the proper direction should do the trick, no matter from where you start the action, but often times I’ve had to swipe three or four times before getting it right. And even when I did, sometimes face unlock flat out refused to work until after the phone already presented me with the PIN or password field. Authentication on the Razr is, put simply, one everlasting exercise in frustration.I do like that you can access quick toggles from that little screen, though I have a tip to offer to anyone who evidently hasn’t been put off by this generally negative review and has still chosen to buy the Razr. If you’ve set the flashlight as one of your preferred toggles, don’t press it while the phone is shut, or you will blind yourself.There was one little feature that delighted me as I used the Razr, if only for a moment — and it’s actually tough to find if you don’t know where to look. Called Retro Razr, it's hiding in those toggles, though you actually have to add it to your chosen shortcuts, because it doesn’t appear in the notifications shade by default. When you fire it up, you’ll get a facsimile of the old Razr experience and UI right on your new foldable phone, which is cute. You can even dial people directly from this menu, which is moderately amusing. I imagine this will be a popular party trick for new Razr owners, and then quickly forgotten. This mode is actually an apt metaphor for the Razr as a whole — charming for about 15 minutes, but not particularly useful. The other issues with the Razr’s software are a consequence of its Verizon exclusivity. There’s a staggering load of bloatware on this thing, from the usual suspects, like Candy Crush Saga and Game of Thrones: Conquest; to Yahoo’s whole suite of apps; to WeatherBug, Verizon’s Message+ client and Disney+. Again, this is the sort of thing that you’d look past on a heavily subsidized device, but it’s much more difficult to ignore when you’ve spent well past four figures on a phone. Thankfully, most of the unwanted software can be uninstalled, save for the Verizon stuff which can only be disabled.Motorola’s rebooted Razr is one of the most interesting phones to come along in quite some time, precisely because it has one foot planted in the past, and another in the future. It’s a bold gamble from a company that once upon a time took risks like this all the time, but hasn’t in the better part of a decade — and, for all this phone’s faults, that’s exciting to see.But oh, the faults. Between the Razr’s midrange processor, awful battery life, disappointing camera and low-resolution display, Motorola made many difficult, cost-cutting decisions to ensure the Razr could be available at a price that some people could potentially afford — at least more people than the Galaxy Fold.I’ll commend Motorola for its effort. Nevertheless, speedy performance, solid photography and respectable battery life should be table stakes for any $1,500 phone — even one that can pull off a party trick as special as this one. And while I really appreciate the value of having a 6.2-inch screen that can fold down to an insignificant size, it doesn’t excuse the myriad other drawbacks."
113,Google Pixel 4 XL,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-4-xl,"Spend a few minutes with the Google Pixel 4, and you'll quickly realize that while the Pixel phones may be leading Google's charge into hardware, software remains at the heart of these devices.Like the smaller Pixel 4, the Google Pixel 4 XL adds a second rear camera lens, but it's the software-powered computational photography that continues to place Google's devices among the best camera phones. There's a new radar sensor on the front of the phone that recognizes gestures and helps unlock the Pixel 4 XL quickly, but it's working with Google's software to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Even a hardware feature like a display with a faster refresh rate is smart enough to adjust itself dynamically, depending on what it is you're doing.Are all these changes enough to help this phone break through a crowd of Android also-rans to challenge Samsung and Apple?  After conducting my Google Pixel 4 XL review, I came away wishing the display were brighter and that the phone lasted longer on a charge.Those who prefer a cheaper price and smaller display should check out our Google Pixel 4 review. But overall, Google has created one of the best phones, offering an excellent mix of good hardware and intelligent software. The Google Pixel 4 XL starts at $899 and its release date was Oct 24, 2019. That price gets you a phone with a fairly skimpy 64GB of storage. For 128GB, the Pixel 4 XL's price goes up to $999.For the first time in the Pixel's history, you can pick up Google's phone from just about anywhere. Previously restricted to Verizon or Google's own store and Google Fi wireless service, now all the Big Four wireless carriers in the U.S. offer the Pixel 4 XL. You'll also find the phone at US Cellular, Xfinity Mobile, Spectrum Mobile and Visible. So finding a Pixel 4 XL shouldn't be a problem, which removes one of the biggest hurdles that kept people from considering past Pixels.If you prefer phones with smaller screens, Google also offers the 5.7-inch Pixel 4 for $100 less than the Pixel 4 XL. If you've never really warmed to the two-tone design that Google used on its previous Pixels, the Pixel 4 lineup represents a bit of a departure. The back is one solid color now — even the fingerprint sensor is gone, as Google turns to facial recognition for unlocking your phone. Some may miss the playful two-tone look, but I think the Pixel 4 XL looks a bit sleeker than past models, even with a camera array, poking out slightly from the upper left corner of its back.Around the front, the notch that divided opinion on the Pixel 3 XL is gone, as Google goes old-school with a thick bezel on top of the Pixel 4 XL's display. (It's the same look you'll find on the Pixel 4.) The bezel is needed to house not only the Pixel 4 XL's front camera — there's just one of those now, as Google is ditching the second selfie camera it added to last year's phones — but also the sensors that power its new Motion Sense features. (We'll talk about how Motion Sense enables faster facial unlocking and gesture-based controls in a bit.)In a world with edge-to-edge displays and curved edges, the boxy Pixel 4 XL can feel a little out of place, and some might label it as boring, perhaps the worst thing you can say about a smartphone's look and feel. But the Pixels have always placed functionality ahead of design flare, and the Pixel 4 XL doesn't deviate from that path.I wish Google got a little bit more daring with colors, as the most radical move it made here was to add an Oh So Orange option alongside the traditional Clearly White and Just Black models. The former makes it looks like you're toting around a square Creamsicle, while the latter colors are pretty run of the mill. The Just Black model I tested has a glossy, mirrored finish that easily smudges. The orange and white models opt for a matte texture.At 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches, the Pixel 4 XL can be a little difficult to use with one hand. But if you prefer big-screen phones, this is something you've long since come to terms with.You'll appreciate the Pixel 4 XL's IP68 water-resistance rating, which should keep the phone safe in up to 5 feet of water for half-an-hour, and makes it one of the best waterproof phones you can buy today. I was less impressed by the durability of the Pixel 4 XL's display, which picked up a scratch just bouncing around my pocket for less than a day — nothing catastrophic, but visible enough for someone else to notice when I handed him the phone to admire.One of the few things differentiating the Google Pixel 4 XL from the Pixel 4 is screen size. Google's larger phone has a 6.3-inch AMOLED screen with sharper 3040 x 1440 resolution. But the most important display feature can be found in both Pixel 4 models: Google's new phones have a 90-Hz refresh rate.And not just any 90-Hz refresh rate, like what you'd get on the OnePlus 7T. Google has made its version dynamic, so when the screen is more static, the phone automatically switches to a lower refresh rate. This means less of a drain on the battery, which can happen if the screen keeps refreshing itself at the faster rate.The benefits of a faster refresh rate are something you have to experience first-hand, so you can see just how smooth scrolling down a web page is when compared to other smartphones, which look downright herky-jerky by comparison. Gaming on the Pixel 4 XL is a pleasure, too. (Since our Google Pixel 4 review was first published, Samsung has released new flagship phones and all three models — the Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 Plus and Galaxy S20 Ultra — support a 120-Hz refresh rate for their displays.)One caveat about the 90-Hz refresh rate: The Pixel 4 XL initially slowed down the screen refresh rate when the display brightness dropoed below 75%. But Google subsequently released a software update that allowed the 90-Hz refresh rate to be active ""in more brightness conditions.""As for the panel itself, I found the Pixel 4 XL’s AMOLED display to show off an array of eye-pleasing colors. Watching the trailer for the sure-to-insane Cats movie via YouTube, the Pixel 4 XL showed off all the uncanny details of the singing cats’ digitally enhanced fur from Taylor Swift’s Orange stripe to Jennifer Hudson’s shabby coat. The results of our testing reflects my experience.Google's new phone shows off 131.7% of the sRGB color gamut. That trails the OnePlus 7T (155.1%), another phone offering a faster refresh rate, but it's ahead of the 118.6% produced by the iPhone 11 Pro Max, another big screen phone. Those colors are accurate, too, as the Pixel 4 XL has a Delta-E rating of 0.26. (The closer to zero, the more accurate the colors.) That's in line with the OnePlus 7T (0.27) and iPhone 11 Pro Max (0.28).Where the Google Pixel 4 XL falls down on the job is brightness. This simply isn't a bright display, reaching 418 nits when we measured it with a light meter. To put that number in context, the iPhone 11 Pro hit 652 nits while the Galaxy S10 reached 611 nits when we tested those phones. Even the OnePlus 7T, which trailed those devices, still finished ahead  of the Pixel 4 XL with its 472-nit rating. When trying to use the Pixel 4 XL on a bright, sunny day, I found myself cranking up the phone to maximum brightness just to see the on-screen controls.Google has been the king of camera phones for some time, though other phone makers have stepped up their game, especially in the year since the pace-setting Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL came out. Apple, in particular, has met the higher bar Google's set with its multi-lens iPhone 11 models adding new software-powered features that improve low-light images and tease out more details in shots.Google is responding with extra lenses of its own, adding a second camera to the back of the Pixel 4 XL. Like the Pixel 4, the 4 XL now offers a 12.2-MP main lens with an f/1.7 aperture, augmented by a 16-MP telephoto lens with an f/2.4 aperture. That latter camera is capable of a 2x optical zoom, matching the iPhone, Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10, to name just a few leading camera phones.But Google's cameras have always relied on more than just hardware alone, and that ability to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence is on full display with the Pixel 4 XL. Super Res Zoom, which uses computational photography to fill in the details when you zoom in for a shot is back, and when coupled with the Pixel 4 XL's telephoto lens, you can get an 8x digital zoom without much loss in image quality. Live HDR+ processes optimized photos in real time, so you can see what they look like in the phone's viewfinder before you shoot. And AI-powered white balance aims to improve image colors, particularly when the lighting gets challenging.You can see the impact of Google's hardware and software improvements in a variety of photos captured by the Pixel 4 XL. Using the telephoto lens, I zoomed in to take a 2x shot of the stands across from my seat, and everything looks crisp and clear from the line markings on the field to the advertisements rimming Memorial Stadium at the University of California. Of course, the same could be said of the iPhone 11 Pro Max's 2x zoom and the photo that produced.It's when you zoom in even further that the Pixel 4 XL's combination of hardware and software really shines. I focused on Tightwad Hill, a hill outside the football stadium where frugal fans gather to watch the game gratis. The iPhone 11 Pro Max does an adequate job here, though you see the kind of fuzziness around individual fans that you'd anticipate from an 8x digital zoom. I think the Pixel 4 XL keeps things a little sharper — some of the fans are a little fuzzy around the edges, sure, but the Gridiron Grill sign remains easy to read, individual trees on the hillside don't blur together, and the color in the Pixel 4 XL's shot is  more consistent.Google also set about fine-tuning its portrait mode, paying particular attention to improving the background blur while figuring out where the background ends and your subject begins. Hair has been particularly troublesome for the Pixel, but the 4 XL does a much better job keeping the many strands of my daughter's hair free from the bokeh effect. (It's still not perfect, as there's a loose lock or two on the right side of her face that appears a little blurred.)As much as I like the composition of the Pixel 4 XL's portrait, I think the iPhone 11 Pro Max did a better overall job. It crops in more tightly, making my daughter the focus of the picture, and I prefer the brighter look to the Pixel 4's darker, almost shadowy colors.The Pixel used to dominate all comers whenever the sun went down and the cameras stayed out, but as you can see in this shot of some lamps in my backyard, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's Night mode can now match the Pixel 4 XL's Night Sight feature. I'm hard-pressed to spot much of an edge in either photo, though the Pixel does manage to not lose the potted plants and lemon tree in the background. Those details are hidden in the shadows of the iPhone's shot. (One edge the iPhone enjoys over the Pixel, though: its Night mode kicks in automatically, while you still have to manually select Night Sight on the Pixel 4 XL.)I went down to a local marina to shoot the Oakland skyline at night, and I think the Pixel 4 XL produces the better shot here. A search light piercing the sky comes through vividly in the Pixel's photo while the iPhone 11 Pro Max downplays those beams of light. The colors from the buildings across the way dance more vividly on the water in the Pixel's photo, and even the boats in the left corner, while not particularly well lit, emerge distinctly from the shadows.Google promises that Night Sight is improved enough to take pictures of the night sky, capturing stars and other heavenly bodies. The skies around me finally cleared up enough for me to take a picture of the sky, though unless I leave my urban surroundings and the light pollution that prevents the stars from really shining, I don't think I'll ever get a really impressive shot. Take this photo I captured with both a Pixel 4 XL and Pixel 3 XL with Night Sight enabled. You can actually spot more stars in the older Pixel 3's photo, though the Pixel 4 XL clearly does a better job of producing a less noisy night sky where the color is a more appealing bluish black. I don't care for either photo, but the Pixel 4 XL does deliver a cleaner view of the night sky. (For more on how the new camera compares to the previous model, see our Pixel 4 vs. Pixel 3 camera face-off.)Speaking of shadows, the Google Pixel 4 XL does a much better job contending with them in this photo of a statue on the University of California campus. Both the iPhone 11 Pro Max and Pixel 4 XL handle the trees well in their respective photos, though the Pixel includes more streaks of green. The key thing here, is that the Pixel shows off more distinct edges of the statute of two 19th century football players. You'd have a hard time making out those same details in the iPhone 11 Pro's effort.How you feel about the Pixel 4 XL's cameras could ultimately depend on whether you like your shots realistic or more colorful. I find the Pixel 4 XL tends to lean toward the former, as this photo of a big bowl of pho illustrates. It's not a bad shot, and you see vivid details like the pho's broth glistening in the light of the restaurant. But the colors in the iPhone 11 Pro Max's picture, while more stylized, are also more pleasing to my eye. I like the pinkness of the beef in the pho as well as vividness of the greens. The iPhone's image is one I'd be more inclined to share, so it gets the nod here.Up front, the Pixel 4 XL uses an 8-MP, f/2.0 camera, which looks like it favors including a generous amount of background detail if this self-portrait I took at a football game is any indication. You definitely see more the field in the Pixel 4 XL's shot, and the bokeh effect adds a nice artistic blur that's not flummoxed at all by my beard (though the brim of my cap and tip of my ear do confuse the camera a little bit).Again, the iPhone 11 Pro Max's reliance on more stylized colors helps it shine here, thanks to my bright yellow hat and the way the field pops even in the background blur. I also like front cameras that include more of the subject in the shot, though I think Google's approach would work better for group selfies.Whether you get the Google Pixel 4 XL or the smaller Pixel 4, your new phone will come equipped with Motion Sense. That’s a new feature built into the Pixels that uses a radar sensor housed in the phone’s upper bezel and Google’s Project Soli to recognize gestures. Swipe your hand in front of the Pixel 4 XL and you can control music playback on an app like YouTube or you can snooze an alarm.There’s a little bit of a learning curve with remembering which direction to swipe to advance and rewind songs, though nothing like the clumsy controls that characterize previous attempts to add gesture controls to phones. Google’s gestures really work, right out of the box, without you having to devote hours of study to Motion Sense. If anything, Motion Sense is a little too responsive, as my colleague Adam Ismail found himself skipping and then rewinding songs when his gestures weren’t abrupt enough. Me, I found that if you talk with emphatic hand gestures, there’s a risk, however slight, that Motion Sense will think you’re trying to control your phone when you’re just trying to drive home a point.The biggest downside to Motion Sense right now is just how limited it is, with gestures controlling only a few commands. If Google’s going to make this feature a more essential way of your controlling your phone, it’s going to have to build in greater functionality, either enabling more phone settings to support Motion Sense or bringing more third-party apps into the mix.Motion Sense does team up with one other feature in a very helpful way. The Pixel 4 XL adds facial unlocking in lieu of a fingerprint sensor, and Motion Sense can detect when you’re reaching for your phone. That way, your phone wakes up and is ready to be unlocked once you scan your face. There’s no lifting the phone to wake it, and then swiping up to finish unlocking the device, as there is with the iPhone. For that reason, I found Google’s face unlock feature to be a touch faster than Face ID on an iPhone Pro. Even better, you can unlock your Pixel 4 XL even when the phone is in landscape orientation, making it as convenient as it is fast. Like most of the other best Android phones released at this time, the Google Pixel 4 XL uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 mobile processor, and the results are about what you'd expect when it comes to performance. Google's new Pixel keeps pace with the top-performing Android phones to come out in the last 10 months, though it's certainly not the fastest phone. And it's still no match for Apple's latest iPhones.We ran Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, for our Google Pixel 4 XL review. Google's phone produced a multi-core score of 2,582, finishing ahead of the 2,329 result we got with the Pixel 4. However, the Pixel 4 XL trailed the 2,640 score for the Galaxy Note 10, which also uses a Snapdragon 855. The OnePlus 7T, which uses the slightly more powerful Snapdragon 855 Plus, outperformed all those phones with a 2,759 Geekbench 5 score. But keep in mind that OnePlus equips its $599 phone with 8GB of RAM to the 6GB found in the Pixel 4 XL.As solid as the Pixel 4 XL's performance may be on that benchmark, it's a long ways off from what you'll get from the A13 Bionic Processor that powers Apple's new iPhone 11 lineup. The iPhone 11 Pro hit 3,509 on Geekbench 5, so the best-performing smartphones are still the ones being designed in Cupertino.It's the same story with graphics. The Google Pixel 4 XL actually outperformed the Galaxy Note 10 on 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme test, with a score of 5,806 to the Note 10's 5,374. The iPhone 11 Pro outpaces both with a 6,163 score.We run a real-world performance test using Adobe's Premiere Rush app to export a 4K video to 1080p after applying a color filter and a transition. The Pixel 4 XL took 1 minute, 31 seconds to finish that task — a 3-second improvement on the Note 10's time. But the iPhone 11 Pro continues to set the pace here with a 46-second result.It's not as if the Pixel 4 XL is a pokey smartphone. Running demanding apps like PUBG Mobile, I didn’t experience any lag even playing the game at its highest settings. Running multiple apps at once didn’t fluster the Pixel 4 XL either. This is a very capable flagship, just not the fastest Android phone around.Last year’s Pixel 3 lineup didn’t exactly set the standard for longevity, with the Pixel 3 XL turning in a below-average time of 9 hours, 30 minutes on our battery test, which involves continuous web surfing over T-Mobile's LTE until the phone runs out of juice. Google boosted the size of the battery on the Pixel 4 XL, opting for a 3,700 mAh power pack to the 3,430 mAh battery inside last year’s phablet.The move pays off, but only slightly. During testing for our Google Pixel 4 XL review, the phone lasted 9 hours, 42 minutes when we tested using T-Mobile's LTE network. That's better than what the Pixel 3 XL did, and more than an hour-and-a-half better than the the Pixel 4, which barely lasted more than 8 hours. So if you value longevity, the Pixel 4 XL is the Google phone to get. Still, the Pixel 4 XL doesn't measure up to other flagship phones. The iPhone 11 lasted more than a half-hour longer, while the Galaxy S10 Plus passed the 12.5-hour mark. These days, the average smartphone lasts around 10 hours on our test, so the Pixel 4 XL's showing is disappointing.Best phone battery life: The longest lasting smartphones(Two caveats about the result: I also ran our battery test using Verizon's LTE network, and the Pixel 4 XL turned in a better result of 10 hours, 2 minutes. We go with the T-Mobile number for a cleaner comparison with other phones, but the Pixel 4 XL can squeeze out a few more minutes of battery life under different circumstances. We also tested with the Smooth Display feature enabled; turning off the faster refresh rate might have improved battery life a little bit.)Like last year’s Pixel phones, the new Pixels offer 18-watt fast charging with the adapter included in the box. I plugged the drained Pixel 4 XL in after our battery test and got up to a 43% charge after 30 minutes. The Pixel 4 XL supports wireless charging, too, and you don't need a Pixel Stand to take advantage of fast wireless charging (though you will need a Qi-compatible charger with Extended Power Profile support.)Google's Pixel phones are inextricably linked to the latest and greatest Android features, and the Pixel 4 XL is no exception. That said, it's not the only phone shipping with Android 10 installed — the OnePlus 7T can make that claim, too. With the Pixel 4 XL, you can expect faster updates, and Google promises that you'll have access to the latest version of Android until 2022. That's not an iPhone-level of support for aging phones, but it's better than you'll find elsewhere in the Android universe.Android 10 isn't the most polished version of Google's operating system, as unfinished features like Dark Mode make it feel like a work in progress. Still, the Pixel 4 XL (and Pixel 4) will support an Android 10 feature yet to arrive on any other phone, even older Pixel models — that's Live Caption, which can insert closed captioning on any video you watch on your phone.Live Caption is pretty cool, though it can sometimes be hit or miss when the feature kicks in. (I found that I had to turn Live Caption on in Settings a couple different times to get it to take.) But it’s pretty magical when it appears, whether it’s captions on a Play Movies trailer or the words in a video I shot floating across the screen. (You can tap and drag the caption box to make it appear in an unobtrusive part of your Pixel’s display.) There’s a slight lag in transcription, but it’s fairly accurate, and it will be a wonderful feature if you want to watch a video without disturbing anyone around you. Don’t keep it on all the time, though, as it can drain the Pixel’s battery.Google's smarts are on display elsewhere on the Pixel 4 XL. Like the Pixel 4, a new Recorder app offers a very cool live transcription feature that can turn your recordings into text in real time. All the processing takes place on your Pixel, so nothing's bouncing back and forth to Google's servers — a valuable privacy feature. I also like the ability to search for specific phrases in recordings and see them highlighted on the timeline, which should be a real productivity booster.The transcript that Recorder produces is fairly accurate — the app stumbles with punctuation and doesn’t always know when one sentence ends and one begins. Compound words like “indecisions” can sometimes be split in two, and the app has trouble with some proper names. But you get a pretty helpful recreation of what was said that you can then share or Save to Google Drive. Recorder’s biggest flaw is that when two people are talking, it doesn’t differentiate between two voices — when I recorded a conversation with my daughter, my questions and her answers ran together in the transcript. So Recorder might be great for capturing lectures and presentations, but less so for interviews and conversations.Google promises tighter integration with the Google Assistant on the Pixel 4, with the voice-powered helper able to better respond to a string of questions and commands, including opening apps and searching for information. In a nod to privacy you tell the assistant how long activity data remains associated with your Google account, and you can even delete all that data with a voice command. I haven't had the chance to put the new assistant through its paces, but it sounds like Google's edge over Apple's Siri continues to grow with the Pixel 4 XL.One perk associated with past Pixels didn't make the final cut with the Pixel 4 XL. You used to be able to store all your photos shot with the device on Google's servers at their original quality; as of the Pixel 4, that's now restricted to high quality once you reach your storage limit, meaning your photos and videos will be compressed. Google does provide a three-month trial of its Google One storage service with your Pixel 4 purchase, but that's not as compelling an offer as you used to get with Google's phone.Choosing between Google’s new Pixels, it’s clear that the Pixel 4 XL is the better option, especially if you like big screens and longer battery life (such as it is). As for how Google’s phablet stacks up to other top smartphones, that’s a tougher call that depends on what you’re looking for in a handset.The Pixel will still be on the short list for anyone who wants a top camera phone, though Apple's flagship exceeds it in many ways, as you can see in our iPhone 11 Pro review. The Pixel remains the best way to experience Android, and exclusive features like Live Caption (which comes to other Android devices this year) and Recorder’s live transcription drive that point home for the Google Pixel 4 XL. That said, if you’re intrigued by the new Pixel’s 90-Hz refresh rate and want the latest version of Android on a big screen phone, check out our OnePlus 7T review; that phone costs $300 less than the Pixel 4 XL.Still, the Pixel continues to deliver the best that Google has to offer — great cameras, the latest version of Android, and software smarts that really allow you to do more with your phone. And the Pixel 4 XL’s wider availability makes it easier than ever to make this phablet your smartphone of choice."
114,Huawei Mate Xs,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/huawei-mate-xs-review-hands-on,"Last year, we got a glimpse at the Mate X, Huawei’s first foldable phone. The Chinese phone maker is following that up with a revised version called the Huawei Mate Xs, introducing a few small but welcome changes to the foldable device. But will it be enough to make the latest Mate X any more practical for most smartphone users?The original Mate X cost $2,499 ($2,704/£2,095), making it the most expensive phone in the already extortionate foldables segment, for a single 8GB RAM/512GB storage variant.At Huawei's press conference launching the phone, Huawei CBG CEO Richard Yu said this phone will be sold worldwide from March 2020. Since the first Mate X never made it to the UK (let alone the US thanks to the US government’s feud with Huawei), we’re looking forward to seeing this fresh take on the foldable phone outside of China.The shape of the Mate Xs is immediately familiar, as it employs the so-called “falcon wing” design that wraps the screen around the outside of the folding frame unlike almost every other foldable we’ve yet seen. (The Royole Flexpai does something similar, but that phone is less refined than anything Huawei makes.)The hinge mechanism has been significantly improved since the Mate X, the most obvious physical change being the addition of round caps on either end of the hinge. These look a little like removable styluses, but they provide extra shielding to protect the 100-part hinge.Having folded and unfolded the Huawei Mate Xs a few times during my hands-on session, I can say it does feel better than the Samsung Galaxy Fold, although that isn’t saying much. There’s a nice pop when you open the phone fully, and a satisfying click when you shut it again, but in between those two points you have what feels like little vibrations caused by the grinding of many tiny gears. I wasn’t afraid of the phone breaking into two on me after a few days of use, but the feeling doesn’t match the luxury you’d expect from this kind of ultra-premium, sky-high priced device.The Huawei Mate Xs display is much the same as it was before. Folded up, you have a front 6.6-inch display and a rear 6.4-inch display, which extend to combine into an 8-inch screen. Huawei seems quite proud of how skinny the device is, boasting about its 5.4mm depth across the unfolded screen. The bar on the side of the phone, which also acts as a handle, measures 11mm deep, which is also the depth of the phone when closed.On the bar, there’s still the recessed power button which also contains a fingerprint scanner for biometric security, as well as the release button that lets you unfold the phone. With this bar, the Mate Xs feels fairly natural and secure to hold despite the fact that the shape is quite unique. I can think of no other phone with this kind of chassis. And a secure hold is exactly what you want with a phone that has an enormous and fragile plastic display that costs thousands of dollars.A quartet of camera sensors also live within the bar on the Mate Xs, and feature the same Leica-tuned lenses that appear on Huawei’s P30 Pro and Mate 30 Pro. These consist of a 40MP main sensor, a 3x optical, 30x digital 8MP telephoto sensor, a 16MP wide sensor (with a 2.5cm macro photo mode), and finally a 3D time-of-flight camera for depth sensing duties.There is no selfie camera on the Mate Xs — instead you just turn the phone around so the cameras face you, which gives you more freedom than you’re used to with normal selfies such as options for ultra-wide shots, TOF-enhanced bokeh, and optical zoom enhancement of your and your friends’ facial features, if you’re feeling brave. If the Mate 30 Pro and P30 Pro are anything to go by, the Mate Xs might be the best foldable for photography around, but we’ll need to perform some more thorough testing outside of Huawei’s demo room.On the software side, the Mate Xs uses EMUI 10, based on the open-source version of Android 10 (so still no Google apps I’m afraid), but with a few new enhancements to help take advantage of the extra screen space and folding-unfolding capabilities. First off is “app expansion”, which lets you see multiple views of certain compatible apps. For example, when opening the Booking.com app, you can have a list of search results on the left while you look at individual entries and photos on the right, making your search for a hotel easier than it would be on a more conventional smartphone screen. You can also multi-task with up to three apps — two docked side-by-side with a third floating on top — which will allow you to coordinate between apps with amazing ease when you’ve got the Mate Xs fully open.Like the first Mate X, the Mate Xs is 5G-compatible, except this time the 5G connectivity is built into the Kirin 990 chip rather than as the separate Balong 5000 modem. Huawei promises this will support both current and future 5G network technology, (read sub-6 and mm-Wave) so you won’t be left stranded by your network provider changing their infrastructure.The Mate X retains its total 4,500 mAh battery capacity, split across two separate batteries. It charges from a 55W fast charger, included in the box, which Huawei claims will fill the phone to 85% full in just 30 minutes. That’s faster than almost any other phone charger I’ve come across. Because of all that heat being distributed across both halves of the phone, Huawei has introduced a new “flying fish” cooling layer that spans the whole device, including the hinge. You can’t see it from the outside at all, but having seen the graphics used by Huawei in its presentation, I’m dying to see a teardown of the Mate Xs so I can have a look in real life.Huawei is known for its excellent engineering, but we’ll have to see whether even its skills are up to the task before them here. Although I'm  confident that the Mate Xs will deal with the strains of everyday use better than other foldables, that doesn't necessarily mean it will manage as well as a standard smartphone. The extortionate price means this will not be a phone for the masses, which in a way is good. Most people won't want to do without Google apps.However, the software features in the Mate Xs seem to make excellent use of the phone’s folding abilities, and the Leica-lensed cameras and 5G-enabled CPU should mean you get processing, network and photo performance worthy of the pricetag. I’m looking forward to trying the Mate Xs out and seeing if the extra waiting time was worth it, and if its major flaws can be forgiven."
115,Nokia 7.2,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/nokia-72,"The Nokia 7.1 was one of late 2018's best cheap smartphones for several reasons. It had a distinctive design composed of quality materials that you wouldn't expect from a $349 handset, an impressive HDR-capable LCD display, solid cameras, a refreshing software experience and good-enough performance.If you were eyeing something more premium than a Moto G6 but didn't quite have enough to spend on a OnePlus 6, the Nokia 7.1 was the easy choice. Now, HMD Global, which sells phones under the Nokia brand, has finally rolled out a successor: the aptly titled, identically priced Nokia 7.2, that mostly picks up where its predecessor left off — for better and worse.Sure, the Nokia 7.2 is better in lots of little ways, but the midrange smartphone market isn't the same as it was a year ago. Today, the Finnish brand has Google's Pixel 3a and its flagship-class camera to contend with, as well as Samsung's bold reentry into the segment with the well-rounded Galaxy A50. And although the Nokia 7.2 is once again compelling enough to land on our list of the finest budget handsets, in that company, it struggles to rise to the level of the best Android phones overall.I'm of two minds about the Nokia 7.2 from a design perspective. On the one hand, its rounded corners, teardrop notch and circular rear triple-camera housing strike me as unimaginative when so many models from Motorola and OnePlus have already done that tired look to death. The Nokia 7.1 looked fresh, classy and unique, with its chamfered edges and gleaming metallic trim; the 7.2 looks completely forgettable by comparison.And yet, I find myself once again so impressed by the way HMD has approached fit and finish with this device that I'm almost willing to cast aside my disappointment with the aesthetics.The Nokia 7.2 comes in two colors. While the aquatic green is my favorite without a doubt, our charcoal review unit still cleans up nicely, thanks to its sleek, sophisticated satin-like matte glass.Flip the 7.2 on its side and you'll find a rock-solid metal frame — or is it actually made of plastic? Surprisingly, Nokia says it's polycarbonate, but trust me: you'd never be able to tell. The chassis feels so robust, with zero give and no creaking, and the buttons are so tight and clicky, that I'd go so far as to say that Nokia's construction feels on a par with most flagships' leagues beyond the Galaxy A50's and even a bit nicer than the Pixel 3a's.I also have to give Nokia kudos for the soft white LED strip embedded into the power button, that breathes to tell you when you've received a notification. A similarly-shaped, albeit non-lit key on the opposite edge of the device offers a quick shortcut to Google Assistant.Along the top, you'll find a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack; not uncommon on budget handsets, though nevertheless appreciated. On the bottom, you'll find a lone speaker, and therein lies my only serious gripe with the Nokia 7.2's hardware. This tinny mono driver shrieks in the upper registers but retains absolutely no low end, such that if you play a bass-heavy track — like trance classic ""Age of Love"" — you won't hear anything except hissing, even at full volume. It's the only aspect of this phone where you get the sense Nokia cheaped out.The 6.3-inch, full-HD display inside the Nokia 7.2 might be LCD rather than OLED, but the company is still promoting it as one of the device's standout features. That's because it's powered by Nokia's PureDisplay engine — meaning the 7.2 isn't only HDR-ready, but it can also simulate HDR's expanded color range on any SDR content.Price: $349 Display (resolution): 6.3-inch LCD (2280 x 1080) Rear cameras: Triple: 48-MP primary (ƒ/1.8); 8-MP ultrawide (ƒ/2.2); 5-MP depth (ƒ/2.4) Front camera: 20 MP (ƒ/2.0) CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 RAM: 4GB Storage: 128GB microSD slot?: Yes; up to 512GB Battery: 3,500 mAh Battery life: 8:20 Size: 6.30 x 2.96 x 0.33 inches Weight: 6.35 ouncesWith PureDisplay active, colors are more saturated, edges are sharper and contrast — the disparity in luminance between the brightest and darkest areas of a scene — is boosted. I won't say this necessarily makes for a better picture in all instances; for example, watching a trailer for the upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog movie on the 7.2 and Google's Pixel 3a, I felt PureDisplay played to the movie's cartoony color palette and frenetic, strobing electric visual effects. If you're watching something more rooted in reality, however, the heavy-handed postproduction isn't all that beneficial.Still, PureDisplay cannot make up for the fact that this is, after all, just an LCD panel — so you're not getting OLED-quality inky blacks here. The color cast is generally cool, and even the darkest tones take on a slightly gray appearance, because the screen still needs to light those pixels even though they're showing no color. That's forgivable on a phone this cheap, though OLED panels are trickling down to progressively more affordable handsets these days — so Nokia might not be able to hold out for long.At least the Nokia 7.2's 511 nits of peak brightness and 153% coverage of the sRGB color spectrum are solid marks for the category. The Pixel 3a tops out at 408 nits, which makes it difficult to see outside on a sunny day next to the Nokia. That said, the Pixel's more robust 182% color gamut demonstrates what OLED technology can do for bolder hues.Nokia wants you to believe the triple-lens camera on the back of the 7.2, headlined by a 48-megapixel, ƒ/1.8 primary lens, can capture photos that rival some from leading flagships. With an 8-MP ultrawide lens and 5-MP depth sensor, Nokia aspired to make the 7.2 just as versatile as those pricier handsets, too.But if there's one thing we know about the finest mobile cameras, it's that hardware alone doesn't make for jaw-dropping photos; software is every bit as important. And software is where Nokia stumbles with the 7.2.It's not for a lack of effort, though. Like some high-megapixel phone cameras, the Nokia 7.2's primary shooter employs a quad-Bayer filter on its 48-MP sensor that melds 4 megapixels into one for superior light sensitivity. Unfortunately, this evidently hasn't helped the device match the nuanced hues and just-right white balance of the Pixel 3a's post-processing.This scene of a rustic building's worn facade carries so much more warmth and detail through the lens of Google's midrange offering, without any of the unrealistic oversharpening that plagues the 7.2's rendition.Indoors, Nokia's difficulties managing intense sources of light are exacerbated. Notice how you can make out the filaments inside the light bulbs in the chandelier in the Pixel 3a's version of this cozy coffee shop scene; those same regions are totally blown out on the shot from the Nokia 7.2. Google's handset also more accurately renders the gray skies outside, though it loses points for the slight degree of noise it adds around the ceiling — blemishes Nokia’s device avoided.The 7.2 can do something the Pixel 3a cannot, however — it can take ultrawide shots, using that 8-MP secondary lens. However, this is yet another case of reality falling short of specs. Although the photos captured with this lens do achieve the desired perspective, they’re also washed out and lacking detail, as a consequence of that rather low-resolution sensor.Like the Pixel 3a, the 7.2 has a dedicated night mode, and can tune photo parameters based on what the camera sees — whether it's greenery or food, or if you're indoors or out. The night setting leaves the shutter open for an extended period to allow as much light to reach the sensor as possible, then takes a few seconds to process the result. But even with those tricks, the 7.2 fails to strike anywhere close to the Pixel's superior sharpness and coloring across the board. Nokia's best effort is a smudgy, awful mess.That brings us to the 7.2's 20-MP front-facing camera. Here, I actually prefer the way Nokia's software diminished the shadows around my eyes and brightened my overall skin tone, though I wouldn't call the effect realistic. Beautification features were turned off on both handsets, but you wouldn't know it looking at the more muted, smoother portrait from the 7.2. Still, my philosophy surrounding front-facing cameras is that most people select the selfie thats more flattering, rather than the one that's truer to life, and the extra megapixels offered by Nokia's sensor at least make for a crisp result.Inside the Nokia 7.2 is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 660 system-on-chip, which offers decent performance — so long as you're not doing a lot of gaming.The Snapdragon 660 is an octa-core processor, and in that way it's similar to the Snapdragon 670 inside the Pixel 3a. The cores themselves are older, however they run at a higher clock speed than those inside the 670 — 2.2 GHz versus 2.0 GHz.On the flip side, the 660 is built on an outdated, larger 14-nanometer process, which means it's less efficient than the 10nm silicon inside the Pixel 3a. The 660 also incorporates a lower-spec image-signal processor and GPU than the Pixel 3a, which may partially explain the gulf in photography quality and definitely explains the gaming deficit.Overall, the Nokia 7.2 holds its own in everyday use and even eclipses the Pixel 3a in some raw benchmarks, like Geekbench 5. There, the Nokia's multicore score of 1,498 just managed to edge the Pixel 3a's 1,336 result — no doubt thanks to that quicker clock speed.Unfortunately, 3DMark's Sling Shot graphics test presented another story entirely. There, the Nokia 7.2 fell well short of the Pixel 3a, posting a score of 2,054 points compared with Google's 2,543. That translated to occasional choppiness while playing PUBG Mobile, and I wouldn't push this phone with a title more demanding than that.The Nokia 7.2's 3,500-mAh battery helped it along to just 8 hours and 20 minutes of runtime in Tom's Guide's custom battery test, where devices load a list of web pages indefinitely on T-Mobile's LTE network until their battery is drained.That's 52 minutes less than the Nokia 4.2, which costs $189, and even further behind the Pixel 3a (11:29) and Motorola's epically long-lasting G7 Power (15:35), with its 5,000 mAh of power. The Nokia 7.2's battery life is serviceable for this class of phone, but it's nothing special. And because it's limited to Qualcomm's dated QuickCharge 3.0 technology, the battery doesn't top up quickly with the stock adapter, reaching only 38% from zero in a half hour in our testing.Like the rest of Nokia's range, the 7.2 benefits from Android One software, making for a pure Google experience devoid of bloatware or any unwanted duplicate apps. Android One is just as smooth and delightful to use here as on other Nokia handsets, so I have no qualms about that aspect of the experience.Rather, my complaints lie with the fact that the Nokia 7.2 comes with Android 9 Pie preinstalled — not Android 10, which has been available to the public since the fall in Google's own phones, and has already made its way to some devices from OnePlus and Samsung.Part of the appeal of Android One, in theory, is that it's supposed to expedite updates, because the software is largely standardized by Google. That certainly hasn't played out in the case of the Nokia 7.2, even though, to the company’s credit, plenty of its other models — even 2018's Nokia 6.1 — have already received Android 10. While it's heartening to see HMD support older models, the fact that it hasn't played out for the 7.2 since its launch in October is unusual and frustrating.The Nokia 7.2 isn't a bad phone by any means, and there are aspects of it — particularly the phone's quality design and bright, HDR-compatible display — that are compelling at the $350 price.However, when you can have the Pixel 3a, and its astonishingly good camera, OLED screen, longer battery life, more powerful chipset and better software support for only an extra $50, the case for the Nokia 7.2 becomes much harder to make.There's also Samsung's Galaxy A50 to consider, which costs the same as the 7.2 but boasts the finest screen in the midrange segment, as well as a triple-lens shooter that's still not quite at the level of Google's optics, but better than Nokia's. Or, if you really want to save every dollar you can, you may as well choose the $299 Moto G7 instead for battery life that outshines the 7.2's, and compatibility with all carriers.There's nothing egregiously wrong with the Nokia 7.2; the problem is, better phones exist."
116,OnePlus 7T,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-7t,"The $599 OnePlus 7T includes many features that you would expect in a flagship phone in a trimmed-down and cheaper package. You get stunning performance, an advanced 90Hz display and super-fast charging in a device that costs several hundred dollars less than what you’d pay elsewhere. The OnePlus 7T's sheer value lands it on our best phones list., but it's not perfect.If you’re after a class-leading camera or a pocketable design, the OnePlus 7T might not be for you. And some shoppers may want to wait to see what the OnePlus 8 has in store for users, as it's rumored to feature wireless charging and 5G. Overall, though, the OnePlus 7T remains one of the best Android phones you can buy.The OnePlus 7T costs $599, and you can buy it from either OnePlus or T-Mobile in the U.S. (T-Mobile remains OnePlus' exclusive carrier partner in the U.S., although rumors suggest that Verizon could join their ranks next year.) In the UK, you'll pay £549 for the OnePlus 7T.At T-Mobile, if you don't want to buy the OnePlus 7T outright for $599, you can pay off the phone in installments for $25 a month over 24 months. OnePlus lets you buy the phone via monthly payments, too, but over 12 months for $50 a month.If you’d like to use the device on a network that isn’t T-Mobile, you could still spring for the unlocked model, which works smoothly with every GSM network, including AT&T. The OnePlus 7T of the best unlocked phones, period.CDMA carriers are a bit of a different beast; the unlocked 7T will work on Verizon, but exclusively as an LTE-only device. That means Big Red subscribers will have to contact customer service and explain their situation to get the phone up and running on Verizon’s towers.Unlike previous OnePlus handsets, there’s just a single configuration for the 7T, and it comes with 8GB of fast UFS 3.0 RAM and 128GB of storage. There’s no microSD slot on this phone, though 128GB should be enough for most users.On one hand, the OnePlus 7T resembles many of the Chinese firm’s previous phones, particularly with its teardrop notch, tall footprint and sloping 3D glass back.But then you notice the ginormous circular rear triple-camera stack — how could you miss it — and suddenly, it’s clear that you’re looking at a new device.In typical OnePlus fashion, the fit and finish all around is superb, especially for what you’re paying. I love the company’s insistence in preserving that valuable alert slider, a habit I wish more Android phone makers would copy. The matte-effect glass on the back feels great to the touch, and the new Glacier Blue color on offer feels so much classier and tasteful to my eyes than the Nebula Blue option that the OnePlus 7 Pro launched with.It’s not only a pretty handset, but a functional one too. OnePlus remains one of the only phone makers that ships its devices with both a pre-applied screen protector and a high-quality clear TPU case right in the box. It’s certainly the best pack-in case I’ve ever used, and helps mitigate the dearth of serviceable third-party accessories that inevitably comes with owning something other than an iPhone or Galaxy handset.And yet, annoyingly, I still find my eyes repeatedly drawn to the OnePlus 7T’s gigantic camera hump — and not in a positive way. For one, it’s a bit obnoxious and gaudy, though I also worry about its durability. The camera housing occupies prominent space on the back, and that’s simply more glass that can be cracked or scratched, poking out from the rest of the hardware.Yet again, I also find myself wishing that OnePlus would make a smaller phone for a change. The 7T’s 6.55-inch display is just two-tenths of an inch smaller than the 7 Pro’s. If the company has truly committed to a two-phone strategy, a cheaper device that is also more compact would make a lot of sense, and may broaden the range of appeal. The 7T might not be the largest phone in the world, but if you’re coming from an iPhone XS, Galaxy S9, S10 or Pixel 3, it will feel a bit unwieldy.MORE: Best Phones of 2019OnePlus is taking a familiar stance with the 7T’s water resistance in that it technically isn’t IP-certified, even though the company assures buyers it will stand up to an impromptu dunk or splash. One one hand, I kind of understand the rationale — IP testing drives up prices and besides, it’s not like IP-rated phones have water damage covered in their warranties. That said, you can’t put a price on peace of mind, and that’s exactly what IP ratings offer.OnePlus has a familiar refrain for the Fluid AMOLED display it introduced in the OnePlus 7 Pro earlier this year. I ask any OnePlus representatives reading this review to forgive any inaccuracies on my part, but it goes something like this: “Once you go 90Hz, you can’t go back.”While I typically dismiss catchy marketing mottos, here’s the thing — this particular boast is absolutely right. The 6.55-inch, full-HD+ panel inside the OnePlus 7T is not the brightest we’ve come across, nor the sharpest. However, it’s easily my favorite I’ve used all year — and that includes the iPhone 11 Pro’s own Super Retina XDR panel — because of that silky-smooth refresh rate.It’s hard to overstate the role animation plays in how our eyes and brains process responsiveness. Technically, at a physical level, it’s not like the 7T is really any faster to use than most other flagships you can buy today. But it truly feels like it is, thanks to that 90Hz panel.Thumbing around Android is simply a livelier experience at 90Hz. So too is gaming, for the few Android titles out there that can deliver higher frame rates. And that’s to say nothing of the 7T’s impressive HDR10+ color reproduction and the breadth of the choices it offers. Whether you prefer a more realistic DCI-P3 look or ultra-saturated hues emblematic of older OLED-powered phones, the 7T can be customized to suit your preference. There’s even a new chromatic Reading Mode that dulls colors for comfort, yet stops short of being complete grayscale.It’s not like the OnePlus 7T is really any faster to use than most other flagship phones that you can buy today. But it truly feels like it is, thanks to the phone’s 90Hz panel.I can live with the 7T’s peak 474 nits of full-screen brightness, which is admittedly far below the 652 nits of the Liquid Retina LCD-powered iPhone 11, as well as the Galaxy S10’s 611 nits. You could probably use that extra luminosity outside on the sunniest day, though in most circumstances, you’re not missing much.When it comes to color accuracy, the 7T, set to its default Vivid color profile, delivered the same Delta-E score of 0.27 as the iPhone 11 Pro that we tested — indicating lifelike hues. And OnePlus’ 155.1% coverage of the sRGB color space shattered the iPhone 11 Pro’s 117.1%, which at least means you’ll get slightly more saturated colors out of the box with the 7T.The OnePlus 7T inherits the OnePlus 7 Pro’s primary, Sony-sourced, 48-MP sensor, as well as its 16-MP, 117° ultrawide shooter. A 12-MP telephoto, capable of 2x zoom, rounds out the repertoire on the back. The same 16-MP front-facing camera originally featured in the OnePlus 7 series looks back at you from a notch, rather than a motorized, pop-out mechanism like on the Pro model.But, of course, these days it's never just a matter of optics. OnePlus tells us it has been continually improving the algorithms that power its UltraShot photography engine and Nightscape modes based on user feedback, too.Based on the 7T’s attempt at rendering this picturesque late summer scene of Hudson Yards’ iconic Oculus, I’m inclined to believe them. While I ultimately prefer the warmer, more realistic colors of the iPhone 11’s attempt, as well as the way Apple’s handset more deftly neutralizes those brightest of highlights (like the reflection of the sun off the white sedan to the right), that big 48-MP sensor and ƒ/1.6 aperture still put up an excellent fight here. And because the 7T uses a Quad Bayer filter, the phone is actually binning four neighboring megapixels together for a 12-MP result that extracts more light out of your surroundings.I came away equally impressed by the strength of the 7T’s ultrawide lens, which captured a picturesque view of lower Manhattan from the edge of Jersey City. For what it’s worth, the iPhone 11’s ultrawide shooter incorporates an even wider field of view than the 7T’s, which explains the relative difference in the sizes of the buildings when comparing the two shots. The iPhone 11 also teases more dynamic range out of the clouds above, providing a delicate gradient of grays and whites that adds a splash of contrast to the image.The OnePlus 7T isn’t a replacement for high-end camera phones, but in many scenarios, it’s good enough.To test out the 7T’s dedicated 2x optically-zooming telephoto lens, I honed in one of the buildings on the banks of the Hudson River. The iPhone 11 lacks a zoom camera — you’d have to spring for the $999 iPhone 11 Pro to make up for that — so, unsurprisingly, it cannot pull in anywhere near the same level of detail as the 7T in this particular comparison. Everything from the trees at the base of the building to the grid of metal frames and windows extending all the way to the sky is just so much sharper on the OnePlus handset.That brings me to my favorite new feature on the 7T: Macro Mode. Like you’d expect, Macro Mode helps you peer in on the smallest of details, allowing you to capture pictures close up that would be rendered a blurry mess on any other device. While the perspective you can get with Macro Mode won’t fool anyone into thinking you’ve used a super-powerful DSLR lens, this feature is nonetheless very impressive.We’ve all experienced the frustration of trying to snap a photo of something that’s just too small — perhaps a ladybug or something else out in nature. In trying to capture the image you see above, I was practically touching the petals of the flower with the back of the 7T I was using, and I was still able to get a relatively sharp result despite the circumstances. No other handset I’ve used can claim that, which is why I didn’t even bother sharing the photo I took with the iPhone 11 from the same vantage point in this review.Unfortunately, I can’t lavish the same praise on the 7T’s bokeh-effect portraits. OnePlus’ attempt at a shot of my colleague Caitlin is thoroughly outmatched by the Galaxy S10’s rendition. Samsung’s handset plainly delivers cleaner details, more realistic color all around and a brighter overall image, which is surprising because both portraits were taken outside in broad daylight. What particularly disappoints me looking at the 7T’s shot is how it somehow managed to muddy up Caitlin’s hair — a pretty egregious error for an otherwise capable mobile shooter.Finally, OnePlus' new and improved Nightscape mode does an admirable job of painting the late night Brooklyn scene you see above. The 7T's algorithms don't embolden edges unnaturally in the same way the S10's do, which makes the result from OnePlus' handset feel more lifelike and less stylized. That said, the 7T opts for a redder cast, which is particularly evident if you pay attention to the way the street lamp overhead colors the asphalt below. Samsung's lighting is definitely more accurate in that respect, making it difficult to pick a winner.Ultimately, the OnePlus 7T isn’t a total replacement for the likes of the iPhone 11, Galaxy S10, or other high-end camera phones that we’ve tested this year. But in many scenarios, I think it suffices as good enough, certainly for a phone that costs less than $600. Here’s an unexpected discrepancy between the OnePlus 7T and 7 Pro: The newer, cheaper phone is actually faster than the latter model, because it packs Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 855 Plus system-on-chip.The differences between the standard 855 and Plus models are slight, yet quantifiable. Both 855 chips comprise eight cores, with four of them designed for low-power tasks, and the other four geared for performance. Among those four is a Prime core with the fastest peak clock speed of them all, and it’s the Prime core that sees the biggest uplift in the 855 CPU — up from 2.84GHz to 2.96GHz.Additionally, the 855 Plus’ Adreno 640 GPU is capable of 15 percent faster graphics rendering than the GPU inside the regular 855, thanks to a boosted clock speed there as well. The upshot of all of this is a phone primed for a superior gaming experience above all else.Sure enough, while I didn’t notice a huge improvement playing PUBG Mobile, the OnePlus 7T’s 855 Plus silicon and 8GB of RAM was more than adequate to run the battle royale shooter at the highest possible frame rate and HDR graphics setting, with anti-aliasing and shadows switched on for good measure.That’s not to say the phone didn’t get quite toasty under all that duress; after about five minutes of play, I needed to ratchet the frame rate down a peg just to continue playing comfortably. But rest assured, if you want to test the limits of that 90Hz display, the 7T has the muscle to do so — just remember, the price of the smoothest gaming experience is a hot handset.In terms of benchmarks, Qualcomm’s snappiest chipset yet makes the OnePlus 7T among the fastest phones out there. In Geekbench 5, which measures overall system performance, the 7T notched a multicore score of 2,759 — more than 100 points higher than the Samsung Galaxy Note 10, yet a hair behind the 2,802 score of the OnePlus 7 Pro we tested earlier in the year, which benefited from 12GB of RAM — four more than the 7T’s 8GB.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeAs for comparisons against Apple’s latest iPhones, forget about it. The $699 iPhone 11 reached 3,251, while the $999 iPhone 11 Pro led with an astonishing 3,509 — even despite the fact both those phones contain half the RAM of the 7T. Even a tuned-up Snapdragon 855 can’t contend with the blistering pace of Apple’s A13 Bionic silicon.We typically test graphics performance using 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme benchmark, though we couldn’t get it up and running on the 7T. However, we were able to conduct GFXBench’s Aztec Ruins off-screen test for high-tier devices, where the phone delivered 1,169 frames at 18 frames per second. The Note 10 got through 1,058 frames at 15 fps, while the iPhone 11 Pro again wiped the floor with both — 2,174 frames at 33.8 fps.The 3,800mAh battery inside the OnePlus 7T is 100mAh larger than the OnePlus 7's, but 200mAh smaller than what you get in the OnePlus 7 Pro.However, the OnePlus 7T recharges more quickly than either of its predecessors, thanks to the company's new Warp Charge 30T protocol. While still pushing 30 watts of power, OnePlus said it's refined the circuitry inside the phone's battery and optimized the charging algorithm to achieve faster speeds than previously possible, using the very same brick the 7 Pro comes with out of the box.By OnePlus' estimation, that means users should get to 70 percent, starting from zero, in just 30 minutes. We didn’t quite see that pace in our results — our unit reached just 61 percent with the stock adapter — though that’s still not too shabby, and at least consistent with the OnePlus 7 Pro’s performance.In terms of battery life, the 7T put in 8 hours and 47 minutes of work in Tom's Guide's custom battery test, where phones endlessly cycle through websites at 150 nits of screen brightness until they run out of juice. Decent though that is, that's not only worse than the OnePlus 7 Pro (9:31); it pales significantly when compared to the iPhone 11 (11:20) and Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus (12:35).Why the relatively short endurance? The 7T's 90Hz display could have something to do with it, as a higher refresh rate increases power consumption. Of course, you can revert to the industry standard 60Hz if you are especially concerned about longevity, though, interestingly, OxygenOS' built-in battery saver mode doesn't automatically reduce the frame rate like you'd expect.Oh, and one more thing — in true OnePlus fashion, the 7T also has no provisions for wireless charging. The company’s standard line against the feature in the past has been that it’s just not speedy enough for a good user experience. Yet that has begun to change in recent years, as companies like Samsung and Google have found ways to push more power over induction coils without damaging their devices. Here’s hoping OnePlus comes around on wireless charging sooner rather than later.OnePlus is touting more than 370 major and minor improvements in OxygenOS 10.0, which range from a refreshed stock Gallery app, to improved algorithms enabling speedier and more secure Face Unlock and optical fingerprint sensor recognition, as well as an expanded Zen Mode that allows users to essentially lock their phone for everything except calls and camera access for up to an hour.OxygenOS 10.0 is, of course, based on Android 10, so you also get all the improvements there, including a more intuitive gesture navigation system and Smart Reply in notifications for all chat apps, not just Google’s own.The new gestures in particular are really clever, because OnePlus has actually improved upon Google’s new back motion, which requires a swipe inward from either side of the screen. On OxygenOS devices, performing this action within the top fifth of the display opens in-app menus — just like the gesture was originally designed to do — rather than sending you backward. It’s a brilliant way of bridging the gap between legacy and future Android, that doesn’t break the way software has traditionally functioned on the platform for years.In fact, so many of OxygenOS’ little enhancements have left me, a Pixel user, preferring OnePlus’ interpretation of Android over Google’s. For example, Dark Mode has been available in OxygenOS for far longer than Google’s hacked-together-feeling solution, so it’s more consistent, and supports the entirety of OnePlus’ stock app suite.And that’s to say nothing about extra features that have been kicking around in OxygenOS for years, like app encryption, the ability to capture scrolling screenshots, the separate drawer for hidden apps and Quick Launch, which essentially uses the in-screen fingerprint sensor as a springboard to shortcuts, if you continue long pressing after unlocking your phone.Speaking of that fingerprint sensor, the optical reader underneath the 7T’s display is the fastest and most consistent I’ve encountered yet in a smartphone. That’s no small praise coming from me, as I tend to have the worst luck with in-screen scanners. The 7T’s is the first I’ve ever used that approaches the convenience and immediacy you get from those old-school capacitive modules.The OnePlus 7 Pro might represent the pinnacle of the company’s product line at the moment, but the OnePlus 7T is the one I reckon most people on the hunt for an affordable Android flagship should buy.I’m forever astounded by how OnePlus continually manages to undercut the competition by significant margins, while producing phones that don’t feel anywhere near as inexpensive as they cost.The 7 Pro’s best feature — it’s 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display — is intact here, as well as its 48-MP main camera and ultrawide shooter. The 7T’s processor is faster than that inside any other premium Android handset this year, save for Asus’ ROG Phone 2. Even Google’s Pixel 4 is expected to ship with a less powerful CPU and less RAM. The 7T’s battery charges ludicrously quickly, and its computational photography — while not in the same class as Apple’s or Google’s — is still respectable for the price.And price is a big advantage. The 7T costs just $599 — practically half what an iPhone 11 Pro with the same 128GB of storage goes for. You could certainly argue Apple’s range-topping iPhone is a better device. But twice as good? Not a chance.I’m forever astounded by how OnePlus continually manages to undercut the competition by a significant margin, while producing phones that don’t feel anywhere near as inexpensive as they cost. You’d expect corners to be cut somewhere, but between the 7T’s meticulously-crafted software and feature-packed hardware, there’s no catch — just the best flagship bargain of the year."
117,Huawei Nova 5T,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/huawei-nova-5t,"The last 12 months haven’t been good ones for Huawei. Thanks to the US government’s blacklist, the Chinese phone giant can no longer use Google Mobile Services, disabling some of the most defining software elements from Huawei’s handsets. But Huawei’s trying to start the new year on a high note, producing one last phone that arrives with Google services included.The Huawei Nova 5T costs £400 (roughly $530), and because the phone launched in China before the U.S. blacklist went into force, it’s still permitted to use Google Mobile Services. As a result, the Nova 5T behaves just like any other Android phone, meaning this isn’t a Huawei device you should skip over.When you do look at the Nova 5T, though, you will notice that its middle-of-the-road approach sometimes lets the phone down — particularly when it comes to the 5T’s display, photo output and many of its preloaded apps. Additionally, the Nova 5T isn’t on sale in the US, meaning rivals like the $399 Google Pixel 3a and $479 Pixel 3a XL look all the more appealing.The Nova 5T faces tough competition, but if you want the Huawei ecosystem or a generally good hardware experience on a phone at a reasonable price, this is a pretty good option.In the UK, the Nova 5T is available in a single version with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, which will cost you £399. For color, you get a choice of black, Midsummer Purple or Crush Blue. The Nova 5T is already on sale in the UK, where you can buy it from stores such as EE (where you get a free pair of Huawei Freelace wireless headphones as a sweetener), Carphone Warehouse, O2, or Vodafone.If you’re in the US, you’ll have to import the Nova 5T if you want this Huawei model. Make sure that you check your mobile carrier is compatible with the handset you’re buying if you do this, but to be honest you’re probably better off looking at another device, especially given the number of high-quality, low-cost unlocked Android phones there are these days.If you’ve seen the front of the Honor 20 Pro, you’ve basically seen the front of the Nova 5T. These phones are identical, from the thick bottom bezel to the punch-hole selfie camera in the top left corner of the display. This makes more sense on the Honor 20 Pro, since it replicates the Honor View 20’s punch-hole display, whereas the Nova looks like no other phone baring the Huawei badge. It’s unlikely that Huawei’s going to change its mind about front designs for the P40 or Mate 40 later this year, which will leave the Nova 5T as the odd one out in its lineup.It’s another story on the back, where you’ll notice a few differences between the Nova and its Honor counterpart. The Nova 5T has its flash built into the main three-camera module in the top left corner, whereas the 20 Pro places it underneath the macro lens to the side of the main camera bump. There’s also a small illustration representing the four cameras on the Nova, as well as the Huawei logo placed sideways along the left edge of the phone, as is Huawei’s tradition.Holding the phone, you’ll notice that despite its 6.2-inch screen, the Nova 5T’s tall and skinny frame makes it comfortable to use with one hand, with your thumb or middle finger resting in the power button/fingerprint scanner cutout. I know several people who are unwilling to trade in older phones because they don’t like the size of modern devices, but the Nova 5T may convince them that larger displays don’t have to mean less ergonomic phones.The 5T’s color options cover the bases well. The black color, which you can see in the images in this review, has a simple shine, making it the most subtle of the color choices. The Crush Blue looks similar but is a little more colorful for people who find the black version too boring, while the Midsummer Purple goes all out with a brand new Nova logo at the bottom of the phone, with the letters of this logo in a slightly different shade of purple inlayed in a pattern up and down the back.Huawei says that it’s aiming at a younger potential customer base than usual with the Nova, and these two brighter colorways are clear evidence of that choice. It’s not a huge variety of colors, but you’ll be at least satisfied with the options whether you want a phone that does or doesn’t draw attention to itself.Just like the Honor 20 series, the Nova features an LCD 6.26-inch FHD+ punch-hole display. That means a near-full screen viewing experience, but you lose out on the better colors of an OLED display.On the plus side, I was happy using the Huawei Nova 5T outdoors in the harsh English winter sun, and never had to think about touching the brightness slider.Comparing it with a pair of OLED phones by watching the cartoony but informative YouTube educational challenge Kurzgesagt, the Nova 5T beats the display of the Google Pixel 3a, which is notably dim for this type of display, though Huawei’s phone doesn’t match the OLED of the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro for brightness or color.On the back of the Nova, you’ll find four cameras — the main 48MP sensor in the middle of the main bump, with the 16MP wide sensor above, the 2MP depth assist sensor below and the 2MP macro sensor on its own to the right.The 48MP sensor makes use of pixel-binning, or ""light fusion"" in Huawei’s own terminology, to make 12MP images that deal better with low-light conditions or just a dreary day in the UK, which I faced when I took the Nova out for some camera testing.This bridge is far brighter in the Nova’s image than it is in the Google Pixel 3a’s, but the brightness costs color saturation, which makes the picture taken by the Pixel 3a preferable in a key area for some photographers.Swapping the two phones to their respective night modes and heading out after dark shows one of the Nova’s photographic weaknesses. This image of the barbican (front gate) of the local castle decorated for Christmas is much blurrier on the Nova, plus the bricks have turned a funny shade of yellow and the sky is not as dark as it should be. It’s OK, but Google has the better low-light mode in Night Sight, even on its cheapest handset.I used the wide lenses on the Mi 9T Pro and the Nova 5T to take a picture of this indoor shopping arcade and Huawei’s obsession with brightness pays off here. Although the area is well lit with skylights and electric lighting, you can make out details a lot deeper into the Huawei image. It also helps that the Nova has a slightly higher resolution than the Xiaomi (16MP to 13MP), but this is a situation where Huawei’s particular flavor of software processing shines.When you go into the Nova’s camera app, you’ll see at the bottom the more common buttons that swap between standard, wide and telephoto camera modes. The Nova 5T doesn’t have a telephoto sensor, but rather uses its 48MP main sensor to zoom in digitally. It’s a good half-measure, since 48MP is one of the largest sensor sizes you can buy on a phone at the moment, and zooming in on such a large image won’t instantly ruin the photo quality. But it’s not the same as a proper optical zoom lens.In this 2x zoom comparison shot of a clock tower with the Mi 9T Pro (which does have a 2x optical zoom camera) you can see the 5T loses definition on the edges of objects like the hands of the clock, casting the bricks in an inaccurate yellow hue. That’s despite the fact that the Xiaomi’s zoom camera is 8MP, and as a result produced a much smaller image than the Nova. Huawei often has the best hardware in its class, but in this example, Xiaomi has it beaten and has a better image to show off as a result.The Nova 5T's macro sensor is something you’ll appreciate if you like to take close-ups. The phone did a pretty good job capturing the foam on the top of my coffee, but it took me several attempts to get this shot. That's because I could easily block the light from the image just by holding the phone in a slightly different position over the cup. Without enough light hitting the tiny 2MP sensor, the white and brown foam turned a hideous gray color.Still, you can get a lot of use out of the macro lens if you have much more consistent sunlight or some artificial light with which to work.Finally, on the front of the Nova 5T, we have the 32MP selfie camera. It’s a very high resolution because of the target audience (young people just love their selfies after all), and it comes with AI beautification features (which in the interests of honest tech journalism I switched off for this comparison), as well as a bokeh-style portrait mode.We see more major color differences when comparing selfies with the Nova to the Pixel 3a. The fact that the 32MP front sensor of the Nova is on paper hugely superior to the 8MP sensor of the Pixel is not as important to the way the two images make the same subject look very different. Google has made the cold winter’s day and my pale skin look like it’s a sunny day and I’ve got a very uncharacteristic tan. The Nova’s image is far more honest, which combined with the higher resolution means that I’ve got to give it the nod here despite the fact that I’d be far more tempted to upload the Pixel’s image on my Instagram.If you’re using one of the two large rear cameras of the Nova 5T and don’t mind some extra brightness, you’ll get a class-leading image. The 5T’s digital zoom makes a valiant effort, but can’t match up to optical zoom on other phones, while its night mode isn’t quite as good as what the Pixel 3a offers. The 5T’s macro lens is far too finicky for quick and easy photography while its selfie camera will divide opinions.The Nova 5T is equipped with the Kirin 980 CPU, Huawei’s top CPU from 2018 (The Kirin 990, found in the Mate 30 series, has since taken its place.) Along with that CPU, you get 6GB RAM and a Mali-G76 GPU, which gives the Nova well above average performance, but nothing earth-shattering.Comparing the Nova 5T to its competition on synthetic benchmark app Geekbench 5, the results show the Nova thoroughly beating the Pixel 3a’s lower-tier Snapdragon 670 CPU and 4GB RAM combo with a multicore score of 2,392 to 1,327. The Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro uses a Snapdragon 855 CPU, a direct rival to the Kirin 980, and also 6GB RAM, which makes its similar but slightly better benchmark score of 2,457 unsurprising.Moving over to graphics tests, I used 3DMark’s Slingshot Extreme OpenGL benchmark and managed a score of 4,040. This blazes past the Pixel 3a’s 1,602, but falls well short of the Mi 9T Pro, which managed 5,098 with its Adreno 640 GPU.For some real-life testing, I booted up the fun and high fidelity Asphalt 9: Legends. As I played, the Nova 5T didn’t struggle to keep up with the fast moving high resolution vehicles on screen, and stayed fairly cool to the touch too. It wasn’t the best quality I’ve ever seen the game played at, but it’s not bad looking by any measure.Like other Huawei phones, the Nova 5T runs on EMUI 9, the Huawei flavored version of Android 9, which remains a good operating system. The Android 10-powered EMUI 10 will arrive on the Nova 5T this month.With EMUI, you get Huawei ID and the accompanying ecosystem of apps like the Huawei App Gallery (not much good for users outside China) and its own crop of basic apps like music player, web browser, email, file browser, notes, calendar and health tracking. These all are fine, but some only work at their best if you sign up for a Huawei ID and use more Huawei products like the Watch GT 2 smartwatch or the FreeBuds 3. It’s the typical story with so-called “bloatware” — if you’re a brand fanatic, you’ll like it, otherwise you’ll just see them as taking up precious home screen space and quickly stuff them all in a folder and never use them again (and no, you can’t delete them).The Nova 5T is a little unique within Huawei’s recent lineup as it can still use Google Mobile Services, thanks to its launch in China before the full US government ban hit. That means you can use any Google Play Store app you like without any hindrance, which wouldn’t be a feature worth mentioning on any other Android phone, but Huawei finds itself in a unique position these days.The Nova 5T doesn’t use a sub-display optical fingerprint scanner that’s becoming more popular on Android phones. Instead, you get a capacitive sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S10e. This sounds a little old-fashioned, but in an inspired move, the Nova 5T has placed this sensor on the phone’s lock button and located it where you’d expect on a modern phone — midway up the right edge of the 5T. So rather than having to press the unlock button and then adjust your grip to place your finger on the sensor area at the bottom of the phone, you can just pick up the phone as you normally would and have it unlocked by the time you’re in a position to use it. This is much better than Samsung's decision to place its lock button near the top of the S10e's right edge, which means you still have to shift your hand to use it.Huawei estimates it only takes 0.3 seconds for the phone to unlock, which is fast enough as it is. But during my testing I found that Huawei’s approach is still far more reliable than any optical fingerprint scanner I’ve tried, sometimes unlocking with even a very slight touch of the sensor. I’d love to see this feature on other phones at this price, but assuming that Huawei doesn’t give away its design secrets, this remains one of the best quality of life features on the Nova 5T.The Nova 5T uses a 3,750 mAh battery, which is a little smaller than the 4,000 mAh average of phones released this year. But considering the LCD display and average performance figures, this smaller size isn’t a big deal for battery life, as the phone will comfortably pass a normal work day, with internet browsing, social media checking and video watching, away from a power source. In the box you have a 22.5W fast charging plug, which promises 50% of a full charge within 30 minutes. After trying this for myself, I actually managed 44% in half an hour. Even though it charges a little slower than expected, this is still enough power for an effective top-up during the day.For a phone of its price, the Huawei Nova 5T met our expectations and sometimes exceeded them. It’s attractive, feels modern to use despite some older components, and is smartly engineered, particularly the outer shell with its narrow chassis and fingerprint scanner/unlock button combination. And because it still has Google Apps and the Play Store available, it’s a phone suitable for anyone, not just Huawei diehards who are willing to get the company’s products at any cost.There are meaningful distinctions between the Nova 5T and its rivals. You get more features, power and a straight-up larger phone for your money with the Nova 5T than you would buying a Pixel 3a or Pixel 3a XL, but having a purer Android experience and more flattering photo processing with Google’s phone are important advantages.The Mi 9T Pro is a closer comparison point. The extra size and weight of the Xiaomi in exchange for a larger display and pop-up camera is worth it, I’d argue, and you also enjoy features such as an OLED display, optical zoom camera and larger battery. Overall though, I can’t find many problems with the Nova 5T — just different priorities compared to its rivals. Buy this phone if you’re looking for some premium quality and a well rounded set of features at a mid-range price, but look to Google or Xiaomi if you have more specific needs."
118,ZTE Blade 10 Prime,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/zte-blade-10-prime,"These days, $179 can get you a surprising amount of phone. The ZTE Blade 10 Prime is a case in point.For less than $200, ZTE's newest budget contender offers a dual-lens rear camera, a notched, 6.3-inch display with slender bezels on the top and sides, and a microSD card slot, so you can store in excess of 2TB of photos, apps and more on your device.On paper, that probably doesn't sound too shabby. But while the Blade 10 Prime performs well for its price, the phone's disappointing battery life, dim display and sluggish cameras keep it from topping our list as one of the best smartphones for those on a strict budget.The ZTE Blade 10 Prime is sold through Visible, Verizon's prepaid subsidiary. Normally, the phone costs $179, though Visible is currently running a promotion that slashes the price by another $50. While the Blade 10 Prime is technically a Visible exclusive, there's another device, simply called the ZTE Blade 10, that is identical to the Prime variant; you can buy it unlocked for $179 direct from ZTE.For a sub-$200 phone, the ZTE Blade 10 Prime has a few things going for it. Buyers should be generally pleased with the phone's performance and build quality, and the cameras take better photos than you'd expect (though the camera app itself could use some tweaks).Thin and light design The Blade 10 Prime is a nondescript black slab in the way a lot of budget phones are, though at least it's very thin and light. The phone's curved back makes it easy to hold in your hand, and the ruby-red power button stands out to add a bit of pop to ZTE's otherwise understated aesthetic.The glossy plastic that ZTE has employed on the Blade 10 Prime isn't the nicest we've seen, though. There's a slight orange peel effect visible under our office lights that instantly torpedoes any impression you might have that this phone has been crafted from glass. Still, that's not particularly unusual in the sub-$200 segment, and everything still feels physically solid.The fingerprint sensor mounted on the back of the Blade 10 Prime is a little small for my liking; but because it's deeply recessed, it's relatively easy to locate with your index finger. It would have been nice if ZTE could have found a way to shoehorn this scanner into the Blade 10 Prime's bottom bezel, given that there's some empty space under the screen on the front of the device.You'll notice a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack hiding in the top edge, which is a bit of an awkward place for a headphone jack to be; with how tall this phone is, it'd be more natural to stash that jack on the bottom. Instead, that's where you'll find the Blade 10 Prime's lone speaker, as the earpiece above the front-facing camera is used for calls only, not media.Strong performance for a budget phone ZTE has turned to MediaTek's Helio P60 system-on-chip to power the Blade 10 Prime. In tandem with 3GB of RAM, this processor mostly keeps things humming along quite smoothly, save for really demanding games.In fact, when compared with one of our favorite budget handsets, the $249 Moto G7 Power, ZTE's phone came out noticeably ahead in two of the critical benchmarks we test. In Geekbench 5, which measures overall system performance, the Blade 10 Prime delivered 1,427 points, compared with the G7 Power's 1,139. Similarly, the Blade 10 Prime eclipsed the G7 Power's 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test by a score of 18,900 to 14,802.Those numbers translate to generally responsive real-world performance when switching apps, browsing Google Maps, surfing the web and scrolling through social media. (Taking photos is another story, but we'll get to that in a minute.) Avid mobile gamers will be pleased to know the Blade 10 Prime can at least run PUBG Mobile at a serviceable frame rate when tuned to low-fidelity graphics, though the experience obviously isn't as buttery smooth or striking as you'll find on the most powerful handsets.Respectable cameras (but frustrating to use) Phones with dual cameras are common these days, though multiple lenses are rare to find under the $200 mark. In that sense, the Blade 10 Prime — with its primary 16-megapixel, ƒ/1.8 lens and secondary 5-MP, ƒ/2.0 lens — separates itself from the budget crowd. Those optics are accompanied by another 16-MP shooter on the front, which is pretty high resolution for a selfie camera on such an inexpensive phone.Let's start with that main rear camera, though. The Blade 10 Prime can capture surprisingly sharp images through that 16-MP lens, especially when compared with the Moto G7 Power's best efforts. Even outside on a rain-soaked night in New York City, ZTE's device pulled in far more detail, with the edges of buildings, cars and passersby more clearly defined. You can even see the rain beading up in the grooves of the asphalt — a texture that is totally lost through the 12-MP lens of Motorola's phone. The Blade's rendition is far from perfect, especially where colors and highlights are concerned, but it's much better than you'd think, given the price range we're dealing with.Indoors, ZTE's device also emerged as superior when I took a photo of a mask hanging on a wall, lit by a mix of natural and artificial light. While I personally prefer the G7 Power's ability to color in the shadows, everything from the glimmer of light reflecting off the paint on the mask's eye, to the splatters on the horns, is so much crisper on the Blade 10 Prime that the lighting deficit almost doesn't matter.It helps that ZTE has chosen to also employ a 16-MP sensor for selfies. You don't have to look hard to see the Blade's advantage here — it's working with twice the resolution of Motorola's device, and it shows. Where I come out faded and glassy-eyed on the G7 Power, my face is brighter, more colorful and in focus on the ZTE handset.The 5-MP secondary lens on the back of the Blade 10 Prime is supposedly there to enable bokeh effects. I say ""supposedly,"" because, while I was moderately impressed with the sharpness, white balance and overall quality of the photo I took of my colleague Kate, the phone repeatedly failed to apply the background blur, no matter whether I used the portrait or bokeh mode.Honestly, it isn't a huge loss; cheap phone cameras never handle bokeh well. Still, it indicates a more serious issue on the software side, even though the Blade 10 Prime's image quality actually happens to be solid overall. ZTE's cameras can be remarkably slow at times, too, and while it's true that most cheap phones have to take a breather in between snapping pictures, the pauses on this device are noticeably longer than those on the G7 Power: As the last photo processes in the background, it's not unusual to experience a slight hitch in the viewfinder after each and every shot you take.Even though the Blade 10 Prime relies upon Google Photos for browsing images after you've taken them, viewing just-snapped photos in the Camera app can be remarkably laggy as well, as swiping animations play back at a snail's pace. This isn't as consistent a problem as the shutter lag, but it did happen on multiple occasions in my experience with ZTE's phone.Besides the pokey camera performance, we found a few other areas where the Blade 10 Prime fell short of our expectations — especially when it came to longevity on a charge.Disappointing battery life You expect to sacrifice power, camera quality and design with cheap smartphones, but the one thing you shouldn't have to give up is battery life.Apparently, ZTE never got that memo, because the Blade 10 Prime put up disappointing numbers in Tom's Guide's custom battery test, eking out just 7 hours and 2 minutes from its 3,100-mAh battery.To put that into stark perspective, that's less than half the endurance of the Moto G7 Power, which turned in a staggering 15 hours and 35 minutes of web surfing on 4G LTE and currently sits atop the list of the longest-lasting smartphones we've ever tested.In working on this review, I charged up both the Blade and G7 Power before one weekend, and then proceeded to use them intermittently over the next couple days. By Monday, Motorola's phone was still sitting pretty at about 65%; ZTE's phone, on the other hand, was about to kick the bucket at 10%.Even the $189 Nokia 4.2, which packs a battery that's slightly smaller than the Blade 10 Prime's, at 3,000 mAh, beat ZTE's underwhelming result by 2 hours and 10 minutes. The Nokia's longevity still isn't excellent, though it's much closer to the average smartphone. Seven hours on a charge from the Blade 10 Prime is just not good enough, especially given the sacrifices buyers already make with a handset this cheap.A solid display that's far too dim In the grand scheme of things, the Blade 10 Prime's 6.3-inch LCD display is passable. The full-HD resolution suffices, and the 122.4% coverage of the sRGB color space and Delta-E score of 0.28 indicate the colors are where they need to be, too.In fact, the screen on ZTE's phone puts the Nokia 4.2's to shame, as that 5.7-inch, 720p device couldn't even crack 98% in the color gamut test. What's more, with a color accuracy score of 0.35 (numbers closer to zero are better), the Nokia 4.2 delivered unrealistically washed-out hues, too.However, the Blade 10 Prime underperforms when it comes to brightness. This panel peaks at a measly 368 nits, which is not especially impressive. In contrast, the G7 Power topped out at 558 nits, ensuring comfortable outdoor viewing on a sunny day. The Blade 10 Prime's screen often looks dim indoors by comparison, and that's never a good sign.That's a shame, because on those rare occasions where the Blade 10 Prime's screen is bright enough to satisfy ambient conditions, it doesn't look half bad. Watching a trailer for Ford v Ferrari, I could make out every driver up and down the iconic start/finish straight at the Circuit de la Sarthe, walking to take their places across from their cars at the start of the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. Having viewed the very same scene in a theater, I was impressed with the fidelity on ZTE's phone.Yet that still doesn't make up for the fact that during most of my time with the Blade 10 Prime — including when I watched that trailer — I needed to crank the display's brightness to the max. And if it had been possible for me to set it even higher, I would have.If you're determined to pay less than $200 for a new smartphone, you're going to have to make some compromises. The ZTE Blade 10 Prime is a reminder of that. For everything ZTE's phone gets right — the respectable performance and solid image quality, first and foremost — it gets hung up in other areas, like with its short battery life and a display that's so dim, it can be hard to see outdoors.However, the Blade 10 Prime is not a bad phone, and for less than $200, you could do worse. The unlocked version of the Visible-exclusive Prime model, the Blade 10, is a solid option for people looking for a cheap, no-contract device with a big screen to take with them to a discount carrier.For my money, I'd spend a little more and nab a Moto G7 Power, to have a battery that lasts twice as long on a charge. The Blade 10 Prime might be slightly more affordable, but that won't mean much once it dies halfway through the workday."
119,Google Fi,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-fi,review-4771.html","It used to be a foregone conclusion that if you were shopping for wireless service, you’d end up at one of the Big Four wireless carriers. Until about five years ago, prepaid and no-contract service in the United States wasn’t particularly popular, and typically reserved only for those who prioritized spending the least amount of money over all else.Today, these networks are viable alternatives to the likes of Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint, no matter what phone you own or how much you’ve got to spend. And since 2015, one of the most intriguing options on the market has been Project Fi, Google’s attempt at making wireless service simpler.A year ago, the service underwent a significant transformation, dropping the “Project” aspect of the name, and rebranding to simply Google Fi. In the same breath, Fi expanded access to include nearly all unlocked phones, after previously restricting service to Pixel devices and select Android handsets from Motorola.We liked Fi when we first tested it in 2017, but the service has changed considerably in the last two years. In many ways, it’s improved — though there are still a few catches here and there, especially depending on the device you bring to the network.Updated Dec. 11, 2019: Our Google Fi review has been updated with information concerning new features for unlocked phones on the network, as well as support for 5G devices.Google Fi is an MVNO (mobile network virtual operator), meaning that it uses other networks to deliver service. In Fi’s case, those networks are T-Mobile, Sprint and regional carrier U.S. Cellular. By consolidating all three, Google provides better coverage than any of them individually.However, not every device on Fi can connect to all three of these networks. Specific phones sold on the Google Fi website, including the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL as well as the Pixel 3a and Moto G7, are optimized to support dynamic switching between the trio of networks. While you now can bring most GSM unlocked handsets to Fi, including iPhones, they won’t be able to switch networks, and will instead be locked to T-Mobile. Fortunately, Google supplies a handy tool to help you determine whether or not your phone will work on the service, as well as a checklist that identifies which of Fi’s features it will support.If you do have a Fi-optimized device, switching between the networks is seamless, and happens without the user knowing. Google’s software is designed to use the fastest, most reliable signal at any given time, and also automatically connects to over 2 million Wi-Fi hotspots worldwide to save data consumption. In fact, Google says it’s been able to speed up the handoff between between LTE and Wi-Fi as of late, trimming times by up to 40 percent. Best of all, the service works overseas, too, at the same pricing as it does at home in more than 170 countries.MORE: Google Fi vs. Verizon: Which Is Right For You?For a while now, Google has secured its public Wi-Fi hotspots through its own VPN, so that your connections couldn't be intercepted by interlopers. Recently, the company went a step further for Fi subscribers, allowing them to channel mobile network and private Wi-Fi traffic over its VPN as well. This feature is optional, and while it was initially exclusive to Fi-optimized devices, you can now take advantage of it no matter what Android phone you bring to the network. You should note, however, that it consumes roughly 10 percent more data by Google's estimation. That's important, because Fi's individual plans charge you based on the data you use, and VPN traffic adds to your data tally.Now that T-Mobile has launched its nationwide 600MHz 5G network, those who bring supported 5G phones to Google Fi, like the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren and Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G, should be able to use those devices over the Uncarrier's 5G network by putting in a Google Fi SIM.  But just because you can doesn't mean you should, or that it's even easy in the first place. Neither of those devices are sold unlocked, so you'd have to purchase one from T-Mobile with a plan, then immediately pay out the remaining value of your phone and get it unlocked. Even then though, you'd be left with a handset that won't support one of Fi's primary features — auto switching between Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular's networks for the best LTE signal.  Theoretically, it'll be much easier to bring a 5G phone to Fi sometime in 2020, once phones with Qualcomm's 5G-capable Snapdragon 865 chipset hit the market. It's also assumed the next Pixel flagship will utilize that processor. If it does, it'll assuredly be sold through Fi, meaning Google will have to provide a lane for owners to use 5G on their network.What really makes Google Fi really special is its pricing structure. Plans begin at $20 for the first line, and $15 for every line thereafter. That initial fee essentially covers your talk and texting. You pay an additional $10 per gigabyte for the data that you use, plus taxes and fees, billed at the end of the month. Auto pay is mandatory.For example, an individual who consumes 3GB will pay a total of $50 at the end of their billing cycle. (That’s $20 for the phone line, plus another $30 for the data.) Google Fi is also unusual in that its rates don’t round up when you go over a certain amount of data. Use 2.1GB of data, and you won’t be charged as if you used 3GB like you might be at most other carriers. Instead, Google charges you $21, as each 100MB of data costs $1.Because Fi prominently incorporates public Wi-Fi networks, depending on where you live, you may not even need to purchase quite as much data as you would on other carriers. That said, having used Fi extensively in New York City, we’ve found that Google’s hotspots aren’t as ubiquitous as you’d hope.Many carriers provide rollover data, but shockingly few let you pay for only what you consume, making Google Fi’s pricing scheme pretty attractive. That said, if you’re one to burn through your data cap quickly, your monthly statement can get out of hand pretty fast. Thankfully, Google Fi offers a feature called Bill Protection designed to stop that.MORE: A Guide to No Contract and Prepaid Phone PlansWith Bill Protection, you aren't charged for additional data past a certain threshold. This effectively turns all Google Fi plans into unlimited data plans once you spend enough money. For example, under the current $10-per-gigabyte model, an individual stops getting charged for data after consuming 6GB, or the equivalent of $80 in one month.Bill Protection is available for group plans too, though the amount you must consume before multi-line plans become ""unlimited"" is higher and differs depending on the number of lines active on your account. Google provides a calculator on the Fi website that breaks down how much subscribers could save in every circumstance.If there's one downside, however, Bill Protection has forced Google to institute a soft cap on users who exceed 15GB in a billing cycle. Go over that limit, and you can continue to use the service and pay nothing, but your data speeds will be deprioritized. This is less than Verizon and AT&T's 22GB limit, or T-Mobile's 50GB limit.Google recently added a more conventional unlimited plan to Fi's repertoire, which starts at $70 per month for one user, but can be as low as $45 per month if you have at least four lines on a group account. (Taxes and fees are not included.) Under this plan, each individual's data only slows after they've used 22GB. A Google One membership, which offers 100GB of cloud storage, is also included with unlimited accounts.Tom’s Guide has tested Google Fi on a number of devices over the past year. In our initial experience with the service, we used a Moto X4 Android One optimized for Google’s network. (That phone has since been dropped from the Google Fi store in favor of newer models.) Setup was a cinch thanks to the handy Google Fi app, which simply takes a Google account (i.e., a Gmail address) to begin. Add a payment method, choose whether you’d like to port a number or create a new one, restart your phone and voila — within minutes you’re up and running.No matter what device we used, Fi’s service was as reliable and consistent as any major network we’ve tested.The Moto X4 connected to T-Mobile’s LTE towers in New York City, according to network analytics app Signal Spy. A speed test displayed 19.5 Mbps downstream and 4.6 Mbps upstream. That’s consistent with what we’ve observed when testing T-Mobile LTE in the past.MORE: My Month With Google Fi: Why I’m Sticking With ItSetup and performance is similarly streamlined even if you bring a device to Fi that wasn’t designed for it, like an iPhone XS. The main difference is that you lose out on network switching, and you have to modify some APN settings to get SMS and MMS working properly. However, that doesn’t take long, and Google provides extensive directions with the Fi SIM kit and on its website to walk you through the process. (Fi only supports SIM-free setup on the Pixel 3 at the moment.)BYOD devices on Fi are stuck on T-Mobile’s network, and don’t benefit from Sprint or U.S. Cellular’s infrastructures. Though in our experience testing speeds in a few locations around central New Jersey, that limitation didn’t make much of a difference.Our Fi-connected iPhone XS averaged 61.2 Mbps for downloads and 7.7 Mbps for uploads, while our Pixel 3, also on Fi, topped out at 18.9 Mbps downstream and 2.7 upstream. The Pixel 3 curiously opted for Sprint’s towers over T-Mobile’s in many of these trials, even at times when the iPhone’s speed test results proved the Uncarrier’s data was flowing better.To make the service a bit sweeter for iPhone users in particular, Google has recently added support for visual voicemail through the Fi iOS app. Previously, voicemail transcriptions would be delivered via text message — a clunky experience, albeit the only way Google could swiftly launch the service on Apple's handsets. Now, iPhone users on Fi can simply slide over to the Voicemail tab in the app and view and listen to all their missed connections there.At this stage, it's unclear if Google intends to roll visual voicemail out for Android phones that aren't fully designed for Fi, like the Galaxy S10. However, the company did recently bring spam call warnings, the aforementioned VPN access and Wi-Fi calling to BYOD Android handsets, so it could happen eventually.Ultimately, customers who take an iPhone or other unlocked device to Fi aren’t missing much without network switching — though, if you’re going to pay Google to use T-Mobile’s towers, you may as well consider T-Mobile’s plans to begin with (or those of its prepaid subsidiary, Metro), especially if you’re a heavy data user.No matter what device we used, Fi’s service was as reliable and consistent as any major network we’ve tested. But that’s not the whole story, because half of the network’s charm resides in its brilliantly designed app and overall customer experience.We’re all painfully familiar with terribly designed carrier apps that hide simple features and information behind dated, clunky interfaces that are excruciating to navigate. Google Fi is a breath of fresh air, as you’d expect from the company that built Android.Open the Google Fi app, and you're immediately presented with a bar displaying your data consumption, that you can preset with a warning to know when you’re getting too close to any self-imposed limits. Scroll down, and you’ll see an overview of your plan above easy links to alter everything from voicemail settings, to blocked numbers to the service address linked to your account.Swipe to the right for Billing and Support tabs, where all your previous statements are easily viewable. Getting in touch with a representative is a snap, too, with options for phone, chat and email alongside estimated wait times. I received a response to a chat query in just 1 minute.The app is such a pleasure to use, unless you have to enlist the expertise on Google’s wonderfully enlightening Google Fi forum, you’ll never need to leave it. But the most impressive part of Fi’s interface is the way it handles multiple phones and lines.At one point, I pulled the SIM card out of our Moto X4 and placed it into a Pixel XL, and Fi was smart enough to know that not only was it in a different phone, but precisely what phone it was and how much data was consumed on it. You can even break down that information into graphs, where daily usage is tallied per device. It’s an impressive degree of detail that is typically absent for users on other carriers who frequently swap SIM cards and devices.You can also order free data-only SIM cards from the Fi app that you can then place inside other devices, like tablets and laptops. The data consumed on those devices will simply be added to your monthly tally, without any extra fees or extra line charges, and Google doesn’t bill you extra for tethering from your Fi phone, either.Google Fi works well and has a great app — but how does it compare to the value offered by other networks? Despite the strength of three carriers, Google’s coverage map is smaller than Verizon’s, particularly in more rural areas.When the conversation turns to price, however, things are a bit different. Verizon’s cheapest individual postpaid plan costs $55 for 5GB once autopay is enabled. On Google Fi, 3GB will run you $50. Although Big Red doesn’t only charge you for the data you use, it does allow you to carry over unused data from month to month.Because Verizon was a longtime exclusive carrier partner for Google’s Pixel devices up until the most recent generation, comparisons against Google Fi are inevitable. But perhaps it’d be more appropriate to cast Google’s network against a less costly prepaid carrier.Metro by T-Mobile is currently our favorite discount-service provider, offering T-Mobile’s speedy network for even lower prices. Customers can get 2GB for $30 per month, or 10GB for $40 — with taxes and fees included. Google Fi runs a whopping $70 for 5GB, though Metro leaves you with two caveats: tethering is not allowed, and all video streams are capped at 480p.Fi is also great if you travel, offering international data and text for no added charge, and calls at 20 cents a minute. Metro has $5-per-month that extends coverage to Mexico and Canada, but its $10-per-month World Calling package is tremendously limited, providing only a paltry 200MB of data, 200 minutes and 200 texts.MORE: MetroPCS Is Fastest Discount Carrier, Straight Talk SlowestIn the past, families didn't stand to benefit as much on Google Fi. Both Metro and Boost Mobile provide each user with their own data bucket, whereas with Fi's pay-what-you-use plan, every line’s data is shared. Now that there's an unlimited option, Fi can be significantly cheaper depending on the amount of people signed up. An individual will spend $70 a month, plus taxes and fees, for unlimited data; conversely, two people will pay $60 each, three people $50, and four $45. Each gets their own 22GB of full-speed data to use as well.Google Fi is by no means the cheapest carrier out there. If you eat up a lot of data, Google’s service can get quite expensive fast. Discounts on multiple lines are also modest compared with other prepaid carriers like Boost and Metro by T-Mobile, and unless you opt for the unlimited plan, everyone draws from the same pool of data on Google Fi.Still, Google Fi offers a premium user experience, thanks to a competitive network map, great coverage for travelers, useful perks (for the devices that support them, at least) and software that is second to none. It’s the best mix of cost and convenience out there, with a simple pricing structure and properly designed app. And in wireless, those two things go very, very far."
120,Motorola One Hyper hands-on,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-one-hyper,"Motorola keeps cranking out camera-focused phones in its Motorola One lineup. After the Motorola One Zoom and its four rear cameras, and the Motorola One Action with its triple lenses and video optimization, we're getting the Motorola One Hyper.This latest phone slots right between the $349 Action and $449 Zoom, and it makes do with just two rear lenses. But the main camera packs quite a megapixel punch at 64-MP, and the 32-MP front camera only pops up when it's time to take a selfie.It's an intriguing phone with an eye-catching design, but the question Motorola's going to have to answer is what the Motorola One Hyper does that the phone maker's other One models do not.For starters, you don't have to pay that much for the Motorola One Hyper, which debuts at $399. That puts it at the same price as Google's Pixel 3a, which just has a single rear camera but also benefits from Google's software smarts.Motorola is selling the Hyper unlocked through its own website. The phone will work on GSM-based cellular networks like the ones operated by AT&T and T-Mobile. Verizon and Sprint customers are out of luck.Though the Hyper uses a case made out of plastic, as you'd expect from a sub-$400 phone, this doesn't look like something out of the bargin bin. Motorola used a 3D curved design on the back of the phone, and combined with the matte finish, it looks like a pretty stylish device. From across the room, I thought I was looking at a much higher-end handset.Motorola opted for some more vibrant colors in this version of the Motorola One. Initially, the phone will debut in a Deep Sea Blue color, but I think the Dark Amber version coming later is much more eye catching. Outside the U.S. — the Motorola One Hyper is also coming to Latin America and parts of Europe — there will be a Fresh Orchid color.One design touch I think users will appreciate is the light ring around the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. It lights up to let you know when there's an incoming call or you're running low on power, along with other notifications. You can customize how that light behaves — whether it blinks or stays solid along with how bright it gets.There's a headphone jack on the top of the phone — thankfully— and a USB-C port on the bottom. Motorola describes the phone as water repellant — it will stand up to an accidental splash — though there's no IP rating for water resistance.The Hyper is 6.4 x 3 x 0.35 inches — a little on the thick side for a phone these days, but tall and wide enough to house a 6.5-inch FHD+ display. Because that pop-up selfie cam eliminates the need for a bezel or notch, you get a lot of uninterrupted screen in this LCD panel with a 19:9 aspect ratio.Let's tackle that pop-up display first, since it's an unusual, though by no means unique feature. (The OnePlus 7 Pro sports one as does the Asus ZenFone 6.) You launch it by tapping on the front-facing camera icon within the Camera app. Or, since this is a Motorola phone and those support gestures, you can make a twist-to-capture gesture with the phone and by default, the pop-up camera will launch in selfie mode.It takes less than a second for the camera to pop up, Motorola says, so you aren't in danger of missing too many shots. I like that the camera makes a mechanical noise as it pops up, but that's just an audio cue and not the sound of actual gears turning. If you're bothered by the noise, you can apparently switch it off in settings. Drop the phone, and the pop-up camera retracts automatically, by tapping into the Hyper's accelerometer and gyroscope to detect that it's falling.As for the rear cameras, you get a 64-MP main shooter, which Motorola says will produce images with a great amount of color and detail. The Hyper's cameras pull that off with quad pixel-binning technology that combines four adjacent pixels into one. (The Motorola One Action uses the same technique.) In addition, there's a laser autofocus feature to keep images in focus and a Night Vision mode for low light photography.Because the Motorola One Hyper features shot optimization, it will auto-detect when to apply Night Vision, though you do have the option of manually turning on that mode. In fact, that's true of all the camera settings, though Motorola says it designed the Hyper's camera and features so that you never have to dig into settings to get an optimal shot.The main camera is joined by a 8-MP wide-angle lens with a 118-degree field of view. That allows for 4 times more scene capture, according to Motorola, and you activate the wide-angle lens with the press of a button.It all sounds promising, though the true measure of the Motorola One Hyper's Camera will be when we get it matched against the Pixel 3a, which is currently our pick for the best budget option among the top camera phones.The Motorola One Hyper runs on a Snapdragon 675, the same midtier processor Motorola uses in its flagship Moto Z4, not to mention the Motorola One Zoom. (The Action gets by with a Snapdragon 670.) For what it's worth, the Motorola One Zoom outperformed the Pixel 3a in benchmarking, and we'd expect the same from the Hyper since it matches the Zoom's 4GB of memory.You get 128GB of built-in storage with the Motorola One Hyper, and you can boost that by up to 1TB if you used a microSD card.There's a 4,000 mAh battery inside the Motorola One Hyper, so we're expecting lots of battery life, especially since Motorola has a good track record of producing long-lasting budget and midtier devices. (The Moto G7 Power is the longest-lasting phone we've tested, and the Moto Z4 lands in on that list as well.) When you do run out of power, the Hyper can support up to 45W fast-charging, though only an 18W charger comes in the box. Unlike the Zoom and Action, this version of the Motorola One will ship with Android 10, the latest version of Google's mobile OS. So that's another area where it can match the Pixel 3a, which just saw an upgrade to the new version of Android.In a world where Motorola is churning out foldable phones like the brand-new Motorola Razr and reaffirming its commitment to high-end devices by pledging to come out with a Snapdragon 865-powered handset next year, the Motorola One Hyper may not necessarily excite. But it would be a mistake to dismiss this phone out of hand. The cameras seem promising and could prove to be a worth alternative to the Pixel 3a, while matching that phone's low price tag.We'll find out for certain when we get our hands on a review unit of the Motorola One Hyper to fully test the device."
121,OnePlus 7T Pro 5G hands-on,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-7t-pro-5g-mclaren,"The great 1980s relief pitcher Dan Quisenberry once said, ""I've seen the future, and it's much like the present, only longer."" He wasn't talking about T-Mobile's newly launched nationwide 5G network, but after spending the last couple of days taking that network out for a test drive, I think he could have been. The Uncarrier's 5G network is, in many ways, a lot like its existing LTE network — and that's both a compliment and a criticism.First, the good news: If early 5G networks from other carriers have you thinking you're going to go on a wild-goose chase looking for a signal, T-Mobile's 5G is pretty widespread (and the carrier has the maps to prove it). But on the other hand, if you're expecting the 1-Gbps speeds commonly associated with 5G, you're in for a rude awakening the first time you run a speed test (something T-Mobile is quick to admit).Right now, two phones work with T-Mobile's 5G network: the Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G from Samsung and the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren. It's that second phone that I've been testing, and to review OnePlus' 5G phone is to also evaluate T-Mobile's 5G network. We need to run more tests on both the phone and the network before we can give a definitive verdict on either. But after several days of hands-on time with the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren, I have some initial impressions.T-Mobile will start selling the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren this Friday (Dec. 6), although you can pre-order the phone right now. You can get the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren for free from the carrier when you switch to T-Mobile and trade in an eligible phone. T-Mobile accepts the iPhone 8 or later through last year's iPhone XR/XS/XS Max, the Galaxy S9 or later, the Galaxy Note 9 or later, the Pixel 3 or 3 XL, this year's OnePlus 7 Pro or the the LG G8. Otherwise, you can buy the phone from T-Mobile for $899 or in 24 monthly installments of $37.50 per month.That $899 cost is noteworthy, because it's $400 less than what you'd pay for the other 5G-ready phone on T-Mobile's network, the Galaxy S10 Plus 5G. It's also just about what you'd pay for an LTE-based flagship phone these days. The Pixel 4 XL costs as much as the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren, and the iPhone 11 Pro is $100 more. Pick up the 5G OnePlus phone, the argument goes, and you can get a device for the same cost as a regular flagship that can take advantage of 5G networks as they become more widespread.Then again, T-Mobile's nationwide 5G network is pretty widespread already, even with the carrier having only flipped the switch on at the start of December. T-Mobile 5G covers 5,000 U.S. cities, reaching 200 million people. That coverage isn't just limited to the downtown area of major cities, but includes outlying suburbs and even some rural areas. That's a sharp contrast to what other carriers are doing; their 5G is concentrated in a handful of cities and usually only select neighborhoods.The reason T-Mobile has such a far-reaching network is because of the technology it used to build out 5G. Its nationwide network is built on the low-band 600MHz part of the spectrum, and those signals travel farther than signals from millimeter-wave 5G networks such as Verizon's in the 18 cities where Verizon currently offers 5G coverage. (T-Mobile also uses millimeter-wave 5G in a half-dozen cities, treating its millimeter-wave towers as super-fast hotspots.) The trade-off, though, is that while millimeter-wave 5G can exceed the 1Gbps download speeds commonly associated with 5G technology, low-band 600MHz 5G doesn't really come close. You'll typically see speeds a little bit faster than LTE, but not so much faster that it will blow your mind.T-Mobile says you should expect download speeds on its 600MHz 5G network that are 20% faster, on average, than what you'd see on its LTE network. Generally speaking, my test results, conducted in various spots around Wailea, Maui in Hawaii, topped that expectation. Inside the open-air lobby of the hotel where I'm staying, I recorded a download speed of 152 Mbps on the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren, roughly 36% faster than the 112-Mbps download speed I recorded on the same spot using a Pixel 4 XL on T-Mobile's LTE network. A half-mile away on the rooftop of a hotel, my 5G speeds increased to 195 Mbps on the OnePlus phone, a big jump from the 91-Mbps result I got on the LTE-based Pixel.The eagle-eyed reader will note those numbers aren't anywhere near the 1-Gbps speeds you'd get on a millimeter-wave-based network (assuming you were in sight of a tower). Nor do they approach the speeds we've seen when we've tested Sprint's 5G network, which uses mid-band spectrum. Indeed, at a local golf course a mile from my other test sites, the 5G speeds ranging between 25 Mbps and 53 Mbps were what I'd expect from LTE. In a handful of instances, usually when I was either indoors or surrounded by a lot of concrete, LTE speed-test results beat out the numbers I was seeing on the OnePlus 7T's 5G connection.The advantage to T-Mobile's approach, though, is widespread availability. I didn't wander far around Wailea during my testing, but wherever I did go, I consistently saw that 5G logo in the upper-right corner of the OnePlus 7T's screen. It flickered back to LTE on only a few occasions. From inside my hotel room, I got a steady 5G signal — and speedy 196-Mbps download speeds that outpace the 96-Mbps number I recorded over LTE — which would be very difficult for a millimeter-wave based network to pull off, given that signal's difficulty penetrating buildings.And I did see some impressive results in real-world tests. It took me 3 minutes and 17 seconds to download the 1.84GB PUBG Mobile game from Google Play onto my OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren. That same download took 4 minutes, 44 seconds on LTE with the Pixel 4 XL. Launching Netflix, I downloaded a 24-minute episode of She-Ra to the OnePlus 7T in 32 seconds. That same download took more than 9 minutes on LTE. I was even able to get all three hours and 29 minutes of The Irishman onto my 5G phone in 2 minutes, 47 seconds. In other words, I could download the Martin Scorsese movie over T-Mobile's 5G network 75 times in the same amount of time it would take watch the movie from beginning to end.On LTE, I stopped the download after 10 minutes, with the file seemingly hung up on the last hurdle.Is the lack of speed on T-Mobile's early network enough to stop you from getting a 5G phone now, even with the carrier promising that speeds will improve in the future (especially if the merger with Sprint goes through)? That's a hard question to answer if we're talking about an expensive phone like the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus 5G. But since the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren costs about the same as a flagship LTE phone, with the benefit of future-proofing built in, it's an easier pill to swallow. You should also consider that you don't pay extra for 5G service at T-Mobile. It's included with the carrier's Magenta unlimited data plan, which costs $70 a month for a single line.Apart from the 5G connectivity, this OnePlus phone shares a lot in common with the OnePlus 7T Pro we saw back in October. Like the 5G version T-Mobile sells, the standard OnePlus 7T Pro features a 6.67-inch AMOLED screen with 3120 x 1440 resolution. More importantly, you also get the 90-Hz refresh rate found on recent OnePlus phones that makes scrolling such a pleasure.There's no notch or camera cutout to interrupt the screen. Instead, OnePlus uses a pop-up camera mechanism for the front shooter, leaving you with a screen-to-body ratio that tops 90 percent. It's a gorgeous display, though we'll need some time in the lab to determine just how bright it is and how accurate its colors are.The look of this phone is one area where the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren departs from other OnePlus handsets. OnePlus has leaned hard into its partnership with the McLaren racing team to produced a phone that draws its design inspiration from the automotive world, right down to the etchings on the glass back of the black-and-gray handset that evoke oil swirls and skids. Breaking up the largely monochrome color scheme is a papaya orange accent line in McLaren colors; I also like that the mute button replicates that orange color.The same triple-lens camera setup that characterizes the back of the OnePlus 7T Pro appears on this 5G version. You get a 48-MP main camera that's aided by a 16-MP ultra-wide-angle shooter with a 117-degree field of view and a 12-MP telephoto lens capable of a 2x optical zoom. The lenses are stacked vertically down the center of the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G, a welcome improvement from the circular eyesore that is the OnePlus 7T's camera array.I didn't get the opportunity to test every camera feature during my hands-on time with the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren, such as the macro mode that lets you take detailed shots from as close as 2.5 centimeters. But while running around trying to get a 5G signal, I did get the chance to snap some photos with both this phone and a Pixel 4 XL. OnePlus' phones have made great strides to improve their cameras, though they typically fall short of the best camera phones, like the ones Google makes. I'm happy to report that the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren provides the Pixel 4 XL with some pretty stiff competition.The One Plus 5G's shot off the coast of Maui of sunset doesn't quite measure up to what the Pixel 4 XL can do. That sun proved too much a challenge for the OnePlus' cameras, and both sky and sea in the section of the photo get pretty blown out with lens flare appearing on the tree that pokes into the right side of the frame. The Pixel 4 handles the unforgiving glare a bit better for a more composed shot. That said, I think the OnePlus handled the plant life in the foreground with greater detail, and it's easier to make out the island of Kahoolawe in the background than  it is in the Pixel's effort.The Pixel 4 XL also does a better job when the lights are low, at least in the instance where I kept the night modes on both cameras off. The light in the Pixel 4 XL's shot looks more natural, and as a result your eye is drawn to the tiki statue in the middle of the photo, which was my intention. You can also make out the textures of the faux rock used to make the idol. The shot from the OnePlus phone bathes the background in too much ambient light, with a lamp in the back left casting too much glare. Some of the tiki details are lost in shadows, too — a problem that the Pixel 4 XL proves better able to handle.The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren asserts itself in this picture of a plate of sliders. There's nothing wrong with either shot, although the Pixel gets a little too aggressive with blurring the background objects to draw attention to the food. The colors are too muted in the Pixel 4 XL shot for my taste, while the OnePlus makes everything look more vibrant, especially the roasted Brussels sprouts tucked between two of the sliders.Both phones did well when I shot a band giving a rooftop concert with the sunset in the background. I think the OnePlus struggles with the angle of the light here, resulting in clouds that are too dark and not terribly eye-catching. The Pixel 4 XL doesn't have that problem, as the clouds are an appealing mix of blue, purple and yellow. Some of the colors and the foreground are a little too muted, but that only puts more focus on the sunset, which is where I'd want it to be in this case.I thought when I zoomed in that the Pixel 4 XL would brush the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren aside. After all, the 3x zoom blows past the 2x optical zoom that both phones support, and the Pixel benefits from Google's Super Res Zoom feature that uses computational photography to keep optical zooms looking sharp. While two of the three band members don't look as fuzzy as they appear in the OnePlus' shot, the poor guitarist on the right gets washed out of the Pixel 4 XL's image. That, plus the more vibrant colors captured by OnePlus' lenses, makes the OnePlus shot more appealing.What about when that 16-MP selfie camera pops up on the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren to capture a self-portrait? Nothing to write home about, based on my testing. The left side of my face feels a little out of focus, and there's a weird cast over the shot. I haven't been impressed by the front camera on the Pixel 4 XL, but it gives my skin a warmer tone, even if parts are overly smoothed.The OnePlus 7 Pro that arrived this spring used a Snapdragon 855 chipset. For this version, OnePlus upgraded to a Snapdragon 855 Plus processor. It's much like the standard Snapdragon 855, only this variation has been optimized for gaming, with performance enhancements for graphics. OnePlus also packed 12GB of RAM into the 5G version of the phone; the standard OnePlus 7T Pro offers a more modest 8GB of memory.That translates to some nice performance gains, at least based on some of the initial benchmarks we've had a chance to run on the phone. Running Geekbench 5, which measures overall performance, the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren recorded a multicore score of 2,784. That just edges the 2,759 result turned in by the OnePlus 7T, which also benefits from a Snapdragon 855 Plus processor. Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 trailed both OnePlus phones, with a 2,640 multicore score.It's in graphics where the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren really sees the benefit from that Snapdragon 855 Plus. On 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test, this OnePlus model enjoyed a 6,207, ahead of the Note 10's 5,374 mark. The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren also beat the graphic test scores of the Note 10 Plus (5,781), OnePlus 7 Pro (5,581), Galaxy S10 Plus (5,648), and iPhone 11 Pro Max (5,392).You get 256GB of on-board storage with the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren, which is generous, though you can't augment that storage with a microSD card.The OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren features the same 4,085-mAh battery found in the standard version of the 7T Pro. We can't run a formal battery test until we've had a chance to measure the phone's brightness, as our Tom's Guide battery test sets screen brightness at 150 nits to ensure a level playing field. We then have the phones surf the web over a cellular connection until they run out of power. I did run a web-surfing test on the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren just to get an idea of how long it might last, and the result was well below the average for smartphones. It's unclear whether that's because OnePlus' phones traditionally don't do well on our test — the OnePlus 7T turned in a below-average result — or the fact that 5G's slightly faster speeds are speeding up battery drain.At least the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren charges quickly, thanks to OnePlus' Warp Charge 30T feature, which promises improved charge times. Specifically, OnePlus says you can get a fully drained phone up to around 68% battery capacity after 30 minutes of charging. My testing bore that out, as I got up to 70% in half-an-hour.Phones released this fall by OnePlus have shipped with a version of the company's OxygenOS based on Android 10, and the 5G version is no exception. That's welcome news if you want your phone to be as up-to-date as possible. You'll find the same special features and enhancements as before, such as a consistent system-wide Dark Mode, and Zen Mode, where you can temporarily disable some notifications and apps.If you find the McLaren look to this version of the OnePlus 7T Pro appealing, you'll doubtless appreciate the clock on the lock screen that resembles McLaren's dashboard instruments. This phone also features some custom-made icons consistent with the McLaren theme.In another feature brought over from other OnePlus models, the 7T Pro 5G has an in-display fingerprint sensor. If it lives up to what we've seen from other OnePlus phones like the 7T, the 7T Pro 5G's optical sensor should be pretty speedy at unlocking your phone.Whether the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren appeals to you will come down to whether you're willing to live with slightly-faster-than-LTE speeds for the sake of a more ubiquitous 5G network that figures to improve over time. The OnePlus 7T's low price (for a 5G phone) makes the modest performance gains easier to live with, especially if you're the sort of person who holds on to a phone for more than a year or two.Otherwise, the OnePlus 7T Pro 5G McLaren offers the same advantages of most OnePlus handsets: flagship caliber performance, a gorgeous display and cameras that can hold their own. We need to do additional testing before we can give a final verdict on this phone, but this 5G version of the OnePlus 7T feels like it's ideal for people ready for the future, even if that future remains a work in progress."
122,Google Pixel 3,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/google-pixel-3,review-5841.html","For all the Pixel 3's implementations of AI — and there a lot of them — this isn't a phone that asks anything unwelcome of its users. There's no learning curve here, no alphabetized list of features buried in submenus to memorize and no sacrifice required to get the most from the hardware. In a way, the Pixel 3 is the anti-Android phone.Here, Google has built a device that bends to you, not one that forces you to bend. And that makes the Pixel 3 one of the best smartphones available. It's delightfully intuitive and easy to live with, yet infinitely capable. In other words, it's the smartphone that will remind you of the very first time you used a smartphone and all the fascination and promise that came with it.Now that the Pixel 4 is launched, stock of the Pixel 3 is dwindling. Google recently cut the phone's price to $499, though those supplies quickly depleted at the Google Store. That means you'll have to look elsewhere to nab last year's model at a good price.Still, if you can track down a bargain, the Pixel 3 remains a compelling value. If you're looking for a great camera for less money — and you're willing to give up some performance — check out our reviews of the cheaper Pixel 3a ($399/£399) and Pixel 3a XL ($479/£469).Update Nov. 25: Amazon has the 64GB versions of the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL for $350 off their original prices, fully unlocked and in every color for Black Friday. It's the finest deal on a high-end smartphone we've seen yet this week, though that could change as we get closer to the weekend, so keep it locked on Tom's Guide's Black Friday deals hub for the latest.Price and AvailabilityThe Pixel 3 started at $799 when it released, though you should be able to find it for hundreds less now while retailers' and carriers' supplies last. The device comes with 64GB of storage, though users who require more storage must tack on another $100/£100 for the 128GB configuration; neither Pixel 3 comes with a microSD slot for expandability. You have a choice of three colors: Just Black, Clearly White and Not Pink.When the Pixel originally came out in the fall of 2018, you had limited options for where you could grab a Pixel 3. As with past Pixels, Verizon sold the phone as did Google's own Project Fi wireless service, which combines coverage from T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular and follows a pay-what-you-use approach. You could buy the phone unlocked from Google as well.Later, the Pixel 3 made it to more carriers. Sprint offers both the Pixel 3 and 3 XL (not the mention the cheaper 3a and 3a XL models). T-Mobile offers just the 3 XL alongside the two cheaper 3a models.SpecsDesign: Charming and compactAt 5.5 inches, the compact flavor of Google's third-generation Pixel is objectively classified as a small handset by 2018 standards, or a normal-size one from a couple years ago. On the Pixel 3, I can effortlessly reach all corners of the screen without involving a second hand. That, in and of itself, is a distinctly antiquated feeling among smartphones today. But it also perfectly symbolizes why Google's relatively tiny flagship is so special.You won't find any Galaxy S9-style sloping Infinity edges here. There's no plurality of rear lenses like on the LG V40; no shimmering, chameleon-like ombré backside that evokes the Huawei P20; and certainly no notch (at least on the smaller model; the 3 XL has caved to peer pressure). There's just an 18:9 display flanked by two reasonably sized bezels housing a pair of booming front-facing speakers. Personally, I'm not bothered by the forehead and chin, as they serve a purpose, though it would have been nice to see Google trim them down a bit more.The design philosophy here is minimalist and unassuming, though I wouldn't necessarily call it boring. There's a charm to the way the Pixel 3 fits snugly in the palm of your hand and how little attention it draws to itself. I've been carrying the Clearly White model for about a week now, and I can't get enough of its mint power button. This adds just the right dash of personality to an otherwise-tastefully restrained handset. Simplicity is very much the operative word here.Google's attention to detail extends to the Pixel 3's all-glass construction — a noteworthy departure from this phone's predecessors, which fused aluminum and glass. Now clad in Gorilla Glass 5 all around, the newest Pixels can finally charge wirelessly.Wireless charging is all well and good, but Google's a bit late to the party. After all, my 5-year-old Nexus 4 drew power from induction pads, at the expense of a fragile, wafer-thin glass back that shattered at the faintest gust of wind. The Pixel 3, on the other hand, incorporates glass in a way it's never been used before in a phone.There's a charm to the way the Pixel 3 fits snugly in the palm of your hand and how little attention it draws to itself.One of Google's iconic design cues is the so-nicknamed ""Pixel Window"": that square of glass that made up the upper third of the Pixel 2's backside, while the rest of the chassis was crafted from metal. But because the Pixel 3 is shrouded in a single sheet of glass, Google had to develop a new etching process to deliver that signature glossy-meets-matte effect.This matte surface blankets most of the Pixel 3. It certainly won't fool anyone into thinking they're touching metal, but it repels fingerprints admirably and presents a thoughtful approach of freshening up plain old glass — both in aesthetics and feel.To keep things consistent, the phone's aluminum frame has been finished with the same shine as the glossy portions of the back. I'm not a fan of this decision — it feels a little chintzy and doesn't lend the same sense of quality as the Pixel 2's distinctive powder coating. But this is a nitpick, and you can rest assured that there's nothing chintzy about the phone's durability. The Pixel 3 is rated IP68 water resistant, meaning it should withstand up to 5 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes.MORE: Pixel 3 vs. iPhone XR: Battle of the Affordable FlagshipsOh, and one more thing: The haptics are fantastic. They don't feel terribly different in the Pixel 3 compared to the Pixel 2, but typing in particular is rich and satisfying, where tapping keys produces precise pops rather than jarring buzzes. Other Android phone makers should take note.Cameras: Better photos through AISay hello to the first Pixel with dual-lens imaging. No, not for the rear camera — that's still a 12.2-megapixel shooter. Rather, the Pixel 3 packs a pair of 8-MP front-facing cameras, one with a wide-angle perspective and another that's more conventional.Of course, those selfie cameras are notable in their own right, but the Pixel 3's crown jewel is that lone rear lens. With it — and with Google's breakthrough HDR+ image processing and Pixel Visual Core chip — this phone turns out some of the best photography we've ever seen from a mobile device.That said, the Pixel 3 does meet a formidable opponent in the iPhone XS. Both phones were used to capture this evening scene as the sun was going down just outside New York's Herald Square. Google's device notably blows out the light collected by the corner of the Macy's building. However, it paints the storefronts and street signs with increased sharpness and steers clear of the hazy warmth that pervades the iPhone's rendition.Inside Grand Central Station, both the Pixel 3 and iPhone XS captured stunning shots of the ceiling of the Main Concourse. The iPhone looks to have the edge here, though, thanks to more-even overall exposure and better white balance, which cuts down on the slight reddish tint in the Pixel's shots. Also, the design on the ceiling is much more noticeable through the lens of Apple's handset.We used Grand Central's iconic clock as an opportunity to test Super Res Zoom. One of the Pixel 3 camera's new features, it combines multiple frames to fill in detail when you're using digital zoom. In this particular example, it's astonishing to see Google's handset deliver an image through software that's every bit as sharp as what the iPhone XS was able to pull off with its 2x optical zoom.However, Super Res Zoom favors certain scenarios more than others. Outside, on a breezy fall morning in Bryant Park, the Galaxy Note 9's optical zoom produced a sharper, punchier shot of some plants at the base of a statue. While the Pixel 3's attempt is by no means poor, beating better optics with software is a tall task. Additionally, the Note 9 benefited from its Scene Optimizer tech, which recognized that the phone was shooting greenery and so tuned the exposure appropriately.When things get really dark, though, the Pixel 3 falters. The Note 9's superwide f/1.5 aperture makes it one of the best devices there is for low-light photography, as evidenced by this comparison. The Pixel 3's dingy, noisy exposure lacks all of the color and detail that Samsung's phablet provides.However, our initial low-light tests were conducted before we were able to try Night Sight — a mode that recently launched on the Pixel 3 in November. Night Sight is a real game changer, turning out phenomenal results by blending a succession of frames together to emulate a long exposure time, and using AI to infer the colors and gaps in detail.Because the Pixel 3 doesn't require a second lens to determine depth, it can perform Portrait Mode bokeh-style shots through its single rear-facing camera. Once again, the results are impressive; there's stronger color and contrast from Google's device, and the fabric in my colleague Caitlin's sweater is more in focus. However, the iPhone XS navigates the boundaries of the foreground better, which leads to less of the artifacting around Caitlin's hair that the Pixel 3 unfortunately left in.How does the Pixel 3 hold up against a more recently released camera like the triple lens setup on the back of the new Galaxy S10 Plus? We still think the Pixel comes out on top, but Samsung's camera gives the Google phone a run for its money, particularly in outdoor shots like the one above featuring hats. Zoom in, and the S10 Plus does a better job with finer details, even if the Pixel's shot produces more vivid colors.In other areas, though, the Pixel 3 maintains an edge despite the improvements Samsung made to the Galaxy S10's cameras. A portrait mode shot with bokeh effects displays more natural color on the Pixel 3, while Samsung's new phone blows out the subjects a little bit.Turning back to our iPhone/Pixel comparisons, the Pixel 3 blows away the iPhone XS where selfies are concerned. Recently, the front-facing sensors in Apple's latest handsets have been criticized for aggressive smoothing. Judging from the result here, I'd say those claims aren't totally unfounded. In contrast, the Pixel 3 delivers a remarkably crisp portrait that perfectly captures my skin tone as well as all the finer details, like the fabric of my flannel shirt and beanie.The next time you accidentally cut your friend out of a selfie, you're going to wish you had the Pixel 3's wide-angle, front-facing camera. Obviously, it draws in so much more of your surroundings than a conventional lens, like the one on the Note 9. But what I love most about it is the way it's implemented in the Pixel 3's camera software. All you have to do is press a minus button, as if you're zooming out.It's almost just as easy to access Top Shot, the last of the Pixel 3's trio of camera-improving features, which captures a bunch of frames before and after you take every photo, no matter which lens you're using. If the Pixel 3 notices that something's off about the one you took, it'll suggest you save a different one as a copy instead. But even if it doesn't do this, you can swipe up on any photo taken and scrub frame by frame until you see something that strikes your fancy.Whether you opt for the 5.5-inch Pixel 3 or the larger Pixel 3 XL, it's encouraging to know you're getting the same great camera. Google remains committed to continuing feature parity between the two models, and people who prefer small phones are better off for it. Outside of the obvious difference in display size and the larger battery in the XL, these are functionally the same devices.MORE: OnePlus 7 Pro vs. Pixel 3: Which Phone Wins?Android Pie: A smarter OSThe greatest thing about a Pixel is never strictly the hardware; rather, it's how that hardware is used. The Pixel 3 comes with Android 9 Pie fresh out of the box, though it'd be unfair to call this simply a stock installation. In actuality, Android on the Pixel is hardly more stock than Android on one of Samsung's products, considering all the exclusive features Google adds to its OS specifically for its phones.As it turns out, Digital Wellbeing is, at least for now, less of an Android Pie thing and more of a Pixel thing. Same goes for the new gesture-based navigation system, which is the default way of getting around on Google's latest flagship but not necessarily all Pie-powered phones.Both features have already made their way to Pixel 2 owners, though, personally, I've gotten tremendous utility out of Pie's new approach to managing notifications. Google Maps has pinged me on multiple occasions for traffic alerts and requests to rate places, and with each notification comes the ability to turn off that particular class of alert. The latest version of Android gives you more control than you've ever had over how and under what circumstances apps should jostle for your attention.Once again, you can squeeze the Pixel 3 to summon your Google Assistant. But I reckon that the phone's biggest little special feature is Call Screen, a service that leverages Google Assistant to, well, screen calls for you.Call Screen: Borderline revolutionaryAnytime you receive a ring from an unknown number, the Pixel 3 offers the option of screening rather than answering. When this happens, you'll see a live transcription of what the robot (or person) on the other end of the line is saying. If you're being solicited, your Assistant will reply with a request to remove you from any lists. But if the caller turns out to be someone you actually want to speak to, you can cut your Assistant off and jump on the line immediately.MORE: Video: Pixel 3's Screen Call Is Simply AmazingCall Screen is that rare feature that works so well and makes so much sense that you'll be amazed it hasn't been done before. In fact, it's already proved indispensable to me, after one incident in which I got rung up from a number I didn't recognize. Google Assistant asked for the caller's info, and when they responded, I found out it was actually my insurance company reaching out about an important claim. I was able to instantly jump in and take over the conversation from my Assistant. But if it weren't for Call Screen, I probably would have just declined the call.Pixel Stand: Wireless charging meets Google HomeGoogle's Pixel Stand wireless charger, sold separately for $79, unlocks even more Assistant goodies, including shortcuts that appear on the Always On display when the device is charging. These shortcuts launch Routines — collections of actions tied to certain scenarios, like waking up in the morning or getting home from work — which you'd typically trigger with a voice command.Other Pixel Stand features include Sunrise Alarm, which adds a subtle glow to the Pixel 3's display that increases in intensity right before you wake up. And owners of Nest's Hello video doorbell will be able to see the feed on their phones the moment somebody comes knocking. You don't need to say a word or open an app; so long as your Pixel 3 is charging on the stand, it'll show you who's at the door.As with the Pixel 2, the Pixel 3 comes with three years of postlaunch Android version and security updates. The industry standard is typically two years of new software. Couple that with phone makers lagging behind Google on delivering updates, and this remains one of the finest reasons to consider a Pixel in lieu of other Android flagships.Display: Finally, OLED the Pixel deservesGoogle heard the complaints about the Pixel 2 XL's display and wanted to set them right. That much is certain from the moment you lay your eyes on the Pixel 3's 5.5-inch OLED screen.The new, HDR-spec panel is better than anything Google's sold in a smartphone before — and by a considerable margin. The issues that riddled the Pixel 2 XL are thankfully nowhere to be found. There's no splotchiness with solid colors and no distracting tint at odd viewing angles. Google has engineered safeguards in the software to stamp out image retention, as well as a new Dynamic color profile that satisfies people searching for punchier hues beyond plain old sRGB.Truthfully, though, you don't need to know any of that to appreciate the Pixel 3's screen. I fired up YouTube to watch the trailer for Sony's upcoming animated Spider-Man flick and sat mesmerized by the amber explosions and neon lights leaping off New York's night sky. The intensity of the colors and fluidity of motion gave the impression of a comic book brought to life.Indeed, the Pixel 3's screen is striking, and it can finally stand tall among the industry's best. That said, a few small concerns keep this display just off the top of the podium.For one thing, Google's full-HD flagship is outmatched by QHD devices like the Galaxy S9, which benefit from higher pixel density. This makes text on the Pixel 3 a bit more jagged than on certain other high-end handsets. Red, green and blue subpixels are also slightly easier to discern with the naked eye on the Pixel’s screen.I can get past that, but the Pixel 3's brightness — or lack thereof — is a little more frustrating. On its highest setting, the Pixel 3 registered just 401 nits on our light meter. That's some 200 nits shy of the iPhone XS. In certain situations, such as under harsh sunlight, Google's device can get brighter. But most of the time, users will be quite limited by what the software will allow.MORE: What a Diehard iPhone User Thinks of the Pixel 3The Pixel 3 offers some of the most-robust color we've seen from a smartphone, topping 202 percent of the sRGB color space on the phone's default Dynamic setting. For reference, the iPhone XS reaches only 125 percent, However, this penchant for saturation comes somewhat at the expense of accuracy, as the Pixel 3 achieves a Delta-E score of 0.44 compared to the iPhone XS' 0.22. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) If it's realism you want, we recommend trying the optional Boosted and sRGB modes.Performance: Beyond the sum of its partsThe Pixel 3 might be really, really smart, but the silicon that powers it is no different than what you’d find in countless other Android phones.That's not to say that the Snapdragon 845 system-on-chip and the 4GB of RAM in the Pixel 3 don't lend themselves to a fast and pleasant experience. But some of Google's Android partners  — like OnePlus, Asus and even Razer — offer twice the amount of memory you get from both the Pixel 3 and 3 XL. And they have the benchmarking results to prove it.Take Geekbench 4, for example, on which the Pixel 3 crossed the finish line with a modest multicore score of 7,316. That's only about 1,000 points more than what the Pixel 2 managed with an older, Snapdragon 835 chipset, but it's some 1,500 points behind the Snapdragon 845-powered Galaxy Note 9's showing. The OnePlus 6 well exceeds the 9,000-point threshold, and you can just forget about the Pixel 3 competing against the A12 Bionic-powered iPhone XS. Apple's handsets are in another league.The Pixel 3 didn't take quite the same drubbing in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test, on which its 4,400 points edged out the iPhone XS's score of 4,244. Here, the OnePlus 6 took the lead, with a score of 5,124, though I noticed no appreciable difference playing PUBG Mobile on Google's hardware.In fact, I'd go so far as to say that the Pixel 3 felt every bit as fast as the OnePlus 6 in all of my daily tasks, which consisted mostly of a mix of Spotify listening, Maps navigation, web browsing, messaging and a little bit of YouTube watching. Recent apps stayed ready at my beck and call, without closing due to a lack of resources.MORE: Pixel 3 XL Hands-On Review: The New Camera Phone King Has ArrivedPerhaps it's because of the way Google optimized things, but this is yet another case where numbers alone don't tell the whole story. Our real-world video-encoding test illustrated as much, with the Pixel 3 converting a short 4K clip to 1080p in 2 minutes and 53 seconds — nearly a whole minute faster than the OnePlus 6, yet an eternity compared to the iPhone XS' 39 seconds.However, some owners of the Pixel 3 (and its XL sibling) have noticed that the phone occasionally shuts down background processes. Initially, many theorized this was indicative of the phones' shortage of RAM, but it may have even more to do with a glitch in the phones' memory management, as earlier Pixel devices with the same RAM allotment aren't as eager to curb tasks so swiftly.To fix this, Google confirmed to 9to5Google that it will push out a software update ""in the coming weeks"" which will hopefully address the issue. For what its worth, our in-house units have sporadically closed background apps, like Spotify while its streaming music — though this has only happened two or three times after nearly a month with the devices.Battery life: Fast charging, not longest lastingThe 2,920-mAh battery inside the Pixel 3 is about average in terms of capacity, but it supports every cutting-edge charging technology on the market today. That includes 18-watt fast charging with the stock adapter, good for achieving 50 percent in just 30 minutes. The phone can also recharge wirelessly at 10 watts through Google's Pixel Stand. (Though the Pixel 3 will accept only up to 5 watts from third-party Qi chargers.)In our battery test, which consists of endless website streaming over T-Mobile LTE at 150 nits of brightness, the Pixel 3 ran out of juice after 8 hours and 27 minutes. In another run, on Verizon's network, the phone managed 8 hours and 12 minutes. Both times are well shy of our 9:48 smartphone average, not to mention the 12:09 that the Pixel 2 XL gave us.However, in typical usage, our Pixel 3 never strained for a charge. One day, I unplugged the phone at 7:30 a.m., and after hours of phone calls, photo taking, video streaming and playing podcasts over those loud stereo speakers, the Pixel 3 lasted right up until midnight. If I had been more careful, I'd venture to say that a day and a half was well within the phone's capabilities.MORE: 6 Reasons to Skip the Pixel 3 for the Pixel 2Theoretically, the Pixel 3 will only last longer with age, too — well, at least until the battery degrades. This is thanks to yet another one of Android Pie's AI features, dubbed Adaptive Charging. After a certain length of time, Adaptive Charging notices your behaviors and intelligently prioritizes certain processes and shuts down others to preserve battery life.Bottom LineThese days, practically every phone maker is desperately trying to do something extra, whether that means slapping five lenses on the back or developing a fancy new way for a camera to pop out of metal. Bucking that trend, Google made its phone more useful for the types of things you'd more likely demand from your phone.Too many tech companies lean on AI as the solution to problems that haven't been identified yet. But the Pixel 3 makes AI tangible through features like Call Screen and Top Shot, using AI to address one of the greatest challenges of mobile photography with Super Res Zoom. It helps, too, that Google's nailed the basics of every great handset by stepping up its display game and refining its design.In fact, my only gripe with the Pixel 3 involves its price. At $799/£739, it's $150/£110 more expensive at launch than the Pixel 2 was, even though the new phone packs the same 64GB of storage. And so much of what makes this device great pertains to software, not strictly hardware. Slight price hikes are expected, but you get the sneaking suspicion Google jacked up the cost just because Apple proved it could get away with upping prices first.That said, there are a lot of pricey phones these days, and the Pixel 3 is far from the most expensive one out there. And the more I use it, the more I'm convinced it's the best Android phone you can buy."
123,Galaxy Note 9,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/galaxy-note-9,review-5647.html","The Galaxy Note 10 is here, but last year's Note 9 is worth a look if you're looking for a powerful Android phone, especially when that are plenty of good Note 9 deals. We expect to see huge savings on the Note 9 over the holidays, so check out our Samsung Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals to stay up-to-date on the latest prices.The Galaxy Note 9 (starting at $899) has plenty of things going for it, including an S Pen that doubles as a remote control. After spending some time with Samsung's new flagship, most of the key highlights this time around feel more like refinements of a great phablet than bold steps forward, but this is still one of the best Android phones and best big-screen phones you can buy.If you're not sure which Samsung phone to get, check out our Galaxy Note 9 vs. Galaxy Note 10 face-off and Galaxy Note 9 vs. Galaxy Note 20 comparison to see which of Samsung's most recent phablet generations is worth buying.Cheat Sheet: What's new with the Note 9?When it debuted in August 2018, the Note 9 cost $999 for the 6GB model with 128GB of storage. Several months after its initial release, though, it's not hard to find discounts on the Note 9. As of this writing, Samsung is offering $100 to $200 off the phone depending on which carrier you opt for; the unlocked version of the Note 9 is $100 off at Samsung, too.The 512GB Galaxy Note 9 costs $1,249, with those same $100 to $200 discounts available at the moment.AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, Verizon Wireless and Xfinity carry the Galaxy Note 9. You can also get it through Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, Sam’s Club, Straight Talk Wireless, Target and Walmart, as well as Samsung.com.MORE: Best Galaxy Note 9 DealsThe boldest thing about the Note 9's design is that it now comes in more vibrant hues. The deeper Lavender Purple model pops more than the Ocean Blue version. However, the Ocean Blue comes with a yellow S Pen, which writes in yellow on the display in Screen-Off memo mode, a nice, subtle touch.Shortly after the phone's release last year, Samsung announced the availability of new Cloud Silver and Midnight Black versions of the Note 9. Cloud Silver is exclusively sold through Best Buy and Samsung's own website, while the Midnight Black variant will be carried at all retailers.If you can tell the Note 8 and Note 9 apart at a glance, kudos to you: The differences between them are so slight as to be imperceptible.The Note 9 and Note 8 have identical bodies — both are 6.4 inches long and 0.34 inches deep. The Note 9’s display is a smidge larger at 6.4 inches to the Note 8’s 6.3-inch panel, which makes it the largest screen Samsung’s ever put in a Note device, but you’d be forgiven for not noticing.The new phone is a tiny bit heavier than the Note 8 (7.1 ounces versus 6.9 ounces), but I couldn’t feel the difference when holding both devices.The biggest change is the fingerprint sensor, which Samsung wisely moved from beside the dual-lens camera to beneath it. This makes it easier for those of us with small hands to easily unlock the phone without straining our stubby fingers. Just be aware that the back of the new phone smudges easily.If there’s one thing Samsung excels at, it’s stunning smartphone screens. The same Super AMOLED panel with quad-HD resolution that you find in the Note 8 and Galaxy S9 is what you get with the Note 9, but then again, it’s pretty hard to improve upon perfection.I haven’t had time to catch up on the second season of Jessica Jones, which I would prefer to watch on my 55-inch TV in the comfort of my living room. But the Note 9’s screen is massive, and OLED lends itself to deep, rich colors (moreso than LED panels, which are brighter). Catching up on my favorite Marvel anti-hero series was fully immersive, though I still prefer a TV for my streaming needs.MORE: Galaxy Note 9 Specs - What You GetOLED panels are now rivaling LED screens when it comes to brightness, at least when in direct sunlight. That’s definitely true of the Note 9, which hit 604 nits on the light meter in our lab tests. That easily beats the Pixel 2 XL’s 438 nits and the iPhone X’s 474 nits, though the S9+ edged out the Note 9 at 630 nits, and nothing really approaches the LG G7 ThinQ, which can clear 900 nits when you max out is brightness settings.The Note 9 is also incredibly colorful: It reproduces 224 percent of the sRGB color gamut, which is better than the Note 8 (204.8 percent), the Galaxy S9 (220 percent), the Pixel 2 XL (120 percent) and the iPhone X (128.6 percent). But the S9+ proves it has the panel to beat, covering an eye-popping 231 percent of the color spectrum.When it comes to the true-to-life nature of those hues, the Note 9 notched a 0.34 on the Delta-E rating (numbers closer to 0 are more accurate). The Note 8 scored a 0.5. The iPhone X’s OLED panel isn’t quite as rich or colorful as the Note 9’s, but its colors are more true to life with a Delta-E score of 0.27 (or 0.21 when the iPhone’s True Tone setting is toggled on).Overall, the Note 9’s display is one of the best around. At its size and price, it should be.The Note’s S Pen seems to get better with every new version of the Note, and the Note 9’s iteration is the best yet. Samsung added Bluetooth connectivity so the new S Pen can be used as a remote control for your phone instead of just a simple stylus.I was surprised at how much I liked using the S Pen remote button. The feature is endlessly customizable and should become even more so now that third-party app developers have access to an S Pen Remote SDK (though Samsung has done a lackluster job at promoting any third-party S Pen improvements that have come out since then). A long press of the stylus’ button can open any app you choose in the S Pen Remote settings, and then you can assign actions to a single click and double click of the button for any app that’s compatible with the S Pen. There are few to start, but we expect a variety of apps to add support for S Pen actions in the future.I found myself using the S Pen primarily as a camera remote, because pressing the shutter when taking a selfie is a constant struggle for me, especially on a phone as big as the Note 9. With the S Pen in hand, I could hold the Note at any angle and and capture a great photo without dropping the phone just by pressing the remote button.I also never worried about the S Pen’s battery, because the pen is usually slotted into the bottom of the phone, which keeps it charged up. If it does die (which it didn’t during my use), then sliding it back into the Note for 40 seconds juices it back up to 100 percent.The Note 9’s S Pen offers all the other great little features that the Note 8’s version does, including the ability to write notes while the screen is off, translate languages by highlighting text and turn your notes into animated GIFs with the Live Message tool.As soon as developers are on board with the S Pen’s remote feature, that might be the best reason to buy a Note 9.The Note 9’s rear camera is essentially the same 12-megapixel dual-lens shooter Samsung put in the Galaxy S9+, which means you can capture portraits with blurred backgrounds. The camera also sports a dual aperture, which can automatically open at either f/1.5 to f/2.4 for brighter low-light images or crisper shots, depending on your shooting conditions.But Samsung added artificial intelligence to the Note 9’s camera software to set it apart from the other Galaxies. And it really makes a difference.Samsung isn’t the first company to make its camera smart — LG and Huawei flagships both have intelligence baked in for automatically configuring the camera settings depending on what you’re shooting. The Note 9 recognizes 20 scenes, including snow, sunsets, beaches and backlit subjects, and adjusts the contrast, brightness, saturation, white balance and other settings you’d normally have to manually configure in the camera’s Pro mode. You can turn off Scene Optimizer if you’d rather take photos without its intervention.The good news: The Note 9’s Scene Optimizer takes your photos to the next level compared to images shot without the feature turned on. In each photo we took, Scene Optimizer increased the contrast and saturation significantly, which made almost every photo look better.For instance, a dimly lit shot of the gold clock in the center of Grand Central Station looked more vivid with the AI setting, which categorized the train station as nighttime. (An icon appears on-screen in the camera preview to tell you when the Note has recognized the scene type.) The gold clock gleamed in contrast to the window behind it, like a scene out of a Harry Potter film.In a photo of foliage in Bryant Park, Scene Optimizer brought out the details in the leaves cascading over the planter. The pink petals were more sharply contrasted against the shrubbery in the AI-assisted image.But sometimes the AI camera goes overboard, like in a photo of a cinnamon-filled pastry. The twisted dough appeared almost orange in the photo, which the camera recognized as food, and the image was overall flat. The pastry’s sheen was more accurately captured in the non-optimized image, and you could see the rivers of cinnamon more clearly.Now, the bad news: Even with AI, the Note 9’s camera still falls short of not only Google’s Pixel 3, but the previous-generation Pixel 2 as well. In a photo of backlit buildings in midtown Manhattan contrasted against a lawn filled with people relaxing after work, the Pixel 2 XL captured the shade variation in the sky and the light reflected in the building windows, and more accurately painted the deep green trees.In a photo of me taken using Pixel’s Portrait mode and the Note 9’s version of Portrait mode, called Live Focus, the Pixel picked up the freckles on my shoulders and the detail in my face moreso than the Note 9, which smoothed out my skin but made it look cooler than it is in real life.The Note 9's camera shines when shooting at night, thanks to the Dual Aperture feature that automatically widens to allow more light in when shooting in dim settings. I took a photo of a rose in my garden at 8:30 p.m. using the Note 9, Pixel 2 XL and iPhone X, and the Note 9's result was the clear winner. The pink petals are saturated and bright, despite the lack of light, and contrast crisply against the green of the leaves. You can also see water droplets from the storm earlier that day. I took the same photo with the Note 9's Scene Optimizer turned on and off, and found the AI didn't improve the detail or saturation in the flower. This is noteworthy because the Galaxy S9+ has the same exact camera as the Note 9, but doesn't have the AI-assisted software in its camera. Turns out you don't need that to capture great nighttime shots.Since the Note 9 released, Google has introduced a new flagship of its own, as well as a revolutionary new feature called Night Sight. This mode — which is reaching the Pixel 2 as well — improves low-light shooting to rival the Note 9’s own capabilities in the dark, even with the AI Scene Optimizer switched on. In the Winter Village at New York’s Bryant Park, Samsung’s handset failed to properly illuminate the trees, the walkway and the side of the New York Public Library. The Pixel 3’s Night Sight mode delivered a more impressive image overall, though it did blow out the lighting in some of the storefronts.Here we see a comparison with Apple’s iPhone XS, where both devices employed 2x optical zoom to crop in on this picturesque winter scene on the banks of the Delaware River at New Jersey’s Washington Crossing State Park. The Note 9’s attempt is better exposed overall but cooler, while Apple’s handset opted for a warmer white balance and did a slightly better job with the highlights, as illustrated by the green traffic light. One notable difference is the way each handset dealt with the falling snow. The iPhone automatically adopted a faster shutter speed, suspending the snowflakes in midair. Meanwhile, the Note 9’s slower-acting shutter blended everything together, making the precipitation more reminiscent of rain.The Note 9 has one smart feature that other AI-assisted cams don’t: Flaw Detection. This feature tells you as soon as you snap a pic if something is wrong with it. The camera recognizes if a subject is blinking, if there’s too much blur, if your lens is smudged, or if the image is backlit, so you can quickly reshoot in the moment instead of cursing yourself afterward. This really worked — we were able to reshoot a blurry portrait that, at first glance, seemed perfectly fine.Overall, the Note 9’s camera is solid, but it’s not the best around, even with Scene Optimizer activated. However, being able to ditch AI and shoot in Pro mode when you want to is a nice touch for professional photogs who don’t need a boost.Like all Android flagships these days, the Galaxy Note 9 packs a Snapdragon 845 processor, but Samsung ups the ante with 6GB of RAM on the standard configuration of the phone, which also offers 128GB of storage. If you want more memory and storage, you can order a Note 9 with 8GB of RAM and a whopping 512GB of storage. But that's not the most interesting part.Samsung says it's employing a water/carbon fiber cooling so the Note 9 can deliver faster performance over extended periods without throttling, such as when you're playing games. There's a 3x bigger thermal spreader (or heat sink) than in the Note 8, which is designed for better cooling performance. We put that to the test — four tests, to be exact — to see how the addition of water/carbon fiber cooling performs in real life. The verdict: It doesn't. There was no noticeable temperature difference between the Note 9 and Note 8, which has a smaller thermal spreader and lacks water/carbon fiber cooling. We reached out to Samsung for comment on our results, and we'll update this review if they respond.In terms of how that translates to performance, our test results prove the Note 9 is indeed a powerful phone, though not the fastest Android device around. We ran Geekbench 4, which measures a phone's general performance, on the 6GB version of the Galaxy Note 9 and came up with a multicore score of 8,876. That's a definite improvement over the Note 8 and its Snapdragon 835 processor, which produced a 6,564 score, and the Note 9 outperformed the Galaxy S9+ (8,295) as well.But the Note 9 didn't match the OnePlus 6 model with 8GB of RAM remains the fastest Android device, with its 9,098 score. We haven't tested the 8GB model of the Note 9, which comes with 512GB of storage and costs $1,249, but it's possible the more expensive Note can rival the OnePlus 6.As for the iPhone X, which runs on Apple's blazing-fast A11 Bionic CPU, it remains a no-contest. The iPhone X scores 10,357 on Geekbench 4. Its single-core result of 4,055 also tops the 2,452 single-core score turned in by the Note 9. Android phones continue to lag behind Apple's offerings in terms of performance, and the Note 9 doesn't change that.When it comes to graphics performance, the Galaxy Note 9 pulled ahead of the Galaxy S9+ on 3DMark's Slingshot Extreme 3.1 benchmark with a score of 4,639 compared to 4,634. However, the Note 9 lagged behind the iPhone X (4,994) and the OnePlus 6 (5,124) with 8GB of RAM.The Note 9 should offer some of the fastest LTE speeds around, as it sports a Cat 18 modem from Qualcomm. This is the same modem in the Galaxy S9 that ran circles around the iPhone X on downloads and uploads, but we'll put the Note 9 through its paces to see if it achieves the same speeds.Samsung put a giant 4,000 mAh battery in the Galaxy Note 9, which means it should last much longer than the company’s other phones.But the Note 9 didn’t turn in the best results on the Tom’s Guide Battery Test (continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile’s LTE network until the phone dies) initially lasting 11 hours and 16 minutes. We turned off the phone's adaptive display feature, and retested: the Note 9 lasted an extra 10 minutes on the test.Don’t get me wrong, that’s solid enough to land the device on our list of longest-lasting smartphones, where its best time of 11:26 lands it in the top 20. It’s also 90 minutes better than the average smartphone’s battery life (9:48).However, the Note 9 lasted just 15 minutes longer than the Note 8, which has a much smaller 3,300 mAh battery. The Pixel 2 XL lasted 12:09 on our test, more than a half-hour longer than the Note 9's best time (and Google’s flagship has a better camera, to boot). The Galaxy S9+ hits 10:59.Samsung is improving its Bixby voice assistant by integrating with more third-party apps and making it more aware of context.But Bixby is still playing catch-up with rival assistants, such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant and even Apple’s Siri, which still balks at tasks like setting multiple timers. Bixby’s new additions, which include the ability to make a restaurant reservation and call an Uber without installing those apps or pressing any buttons at all, are still buggy at this point.Bixby couldn’t understand my requests to book reservations at the popular new bistro Frenchette or an udon noodle shop in midtown. Specifically, Bixby didn’t understand the name Frenchette, which it heard as “French at” or “friendship,” or the word “udon,” which it heard as “wood-on” — instead, it showed me nearby furniture stores. When I asked Bixby to make a reservation for lunch at 2 p.m. nearby, plenty of restaurants close to my office popped up, but most of them were fast-casual spots that don’t take reservations.I tried a different approach: “Make a reservation tonight for French.”French restaurants in midtown Manhattan popped up. Bixby asked which one I wanted. At the top of the list was Per Se, so I said, “Per Se.” Bixby heard, “Persei,” and I still was no closer to making dinner plans.Eventually, I must’ve overwhelmed the assistant, because an error message popped up: “Can’t talk to Bixby right now.”Fine. I didn’t want to talk to Bixby anyway.MORE: Alexa vs. Google Assistant vs. SiriCalling an Uber was much more seamless. After connecting my Uber account to Bixby, I had the assistant hail an UberX to JFK Airport with no issues, and I even knew how much it would cost in advance.But there are still bugs to be worked out. Bixby doesn’t respond quickly, and often mishears what you ask about (as in the restaurant kerfuffle above). If Bixby is going to be the foundation of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Home speaker, it’s gonna need a whole lot of work to compete with Alexa.Samsung has been an innovator with the Galaxy Note lineup, with past models setting the bar for productivity powerhouses with huge screens. But these days, nearly every flagship phone is now giant. Having a cutting-edge processor, pro-level camera and lengthy battery life is no longer special.Where the Note 9 shines is as a high-performance phone. If your productivity depends on a device that has a giant display and the ability to get more work done with the powerful S Pen, Samsung’s latest phone is the one for you. And its ability to connect to an external display with just a cable makes ideal for power users.The Note 9 is an excellent phone, to be sure, but it’s not breaking any molds. The battery life is good, but not industry-leading. The camera is good, but Google’s 10-month-old Pixel 2 XL is still better, and phones released after the Note 9 came out have raised the bar even higher. Bixby still needs serious work, though no one is buying a Samsung device for its assistantSo, unless you love the idea of using an S Pen, you may want to wait until this fall to compare all of the latest flagships before you buy-including the expected trio of new iPhones. But if you need a big-screen phone, the Note 9 should not disappoint.Credit: Tom's Guide"
124,Samsung Galaxy A50,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/galaxy-a50,review-6587.html","The Samsung Galaxy S50 is something you don't see often from the company: a very good cheap phone.  In fact, the triple-camera, 6.4-inch, $349/£309 Galaxy A50 is one of the best Android phones for the money.The Galaxy A50 is remarkably competitive for its price, with those headline features as well as strong performance from Samsung's in-house developed processor. And it actually looks pretty sharp for a bargain, too.Once upon a time, we would have named it our go-to sub-$400 phone in a heartbeat. But today, Samsung has the unfortunate task of following up Google's Pixel 3a. How does the Galaxy A50 compare? Quite well.After initially releasing on Verizon, Sprint and US Cellular, you can now buy an unlocked version of the Galaxy A50 for the same price of $349. One of the best unlocked phones, this A50 model works on all networks that allow customers to bring their own phones. Best Buy is offering the unlocked A50, and if you activate the device on Verizon, AT&T or Sprint when you purchase it from the retailer, you can save $50.Those who would rather go through their carrier and opt for an installment plan can also save some cash, as Verizon is running a promotion in which you can get the device for $10 per month over 24 months, for a total of $240. U.S. Cellular charges $11.66 per month when you buy the Galaxy A50 on that carrier's 30-month installment plans.In the UK, you can get the Galaxy A50 SIM-free for around £309, with Samsung UK, Amazon UK and Carphone Warehouse all selling the phone at prices within pennies of each other.The A50 can be had only in black, with 64 GB of onboard storage and 4 GB of RAM. (Samsung sells alternate configurations of the phone in other markets, but this is all American buyers get.) However, there is a microSD slot that accepts cards up to 512 GB in size, allowing you to greatly expand that built-in space for apps, photos and music if you so choose.With a 6.4-inch display, slim bezels and U-shaped notch lending priority placement to the front-facing camera, the Galaxy A50 could be mistaken for a flagship phone.The A50 isn't the only cheap Galaxy to land this year. We've also received the $249/£169 Galaxy A20 and the $179/£139 Galaxy A10e, on a swath of carriers beyond Verizon and Sprint, including AT&T, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular and Xfinity Mobile from Comcast.With a 6.4-inch display, slim bezels and U-shaped notch lending priority placement to the front-facing camera, the Galaxy A50 could be mistaken for a flagship phone. It's only when you inspect this handset up close that little cost-cutting measures begin to reveal themselves.I wouldn't say the A50 feels as cheap as its price might suggest, although clearly it can't compare with Samsung's S-series products in build quality. The iridescent, pseudo-gray back flashes in subtle waves of rainbows, but attracts more fingerprints than the Gorilla Glass-coated S10. In addition, the rippled, distorted reflections can't help but give away the phone's polycarbonate composition.The Galaxy A50 is a hair thinner than the Galaxy S10 Plus and noticeably lighter as well, thanks to an all-plastic build replacing the S10 Plus' aluminum-and-glass makeup.Still, Samsung's managed to shoehorn a gigantic 4,000-mAh battery in the A50's slender frame, as well as a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack on the bottom edge, next to the USB Type-C port. Perhaps even more impressive is the A50's in-screen fingerprint recognition — a feature that hasn't even made its way to some premium handsets yet.It’s admirable enough that Samsung has delivered a 6.4-inch, Full-HD+ Super AMOLED panel in a $349/£309 phone. But what's truly impressive is precisely how good the A50's screen is.The optical scanner in the midrange Galaxy technically isn't as secure as the ultrasonic system underpinning the S10, and you'll have to put up with a palpable delay that isn't present in traditional capacitive sensors. Still, it has proved reliable and easy-to-use in our testing — certainly a win for a device this inexpensive.On the flip side, the A50's lack of IP-rated water resistance and stereo speakers are very much appropriate given the phone's low price. At least the lone bottom-firing speaker gets plenty loud.Lately, we've seen phones with OLED displays tumbling in price. The $499 Moto Z4 (not available in the UK) and the $399/£399 Pixel 3a are notable examples, though, with the Galaxy A50, Samsung has undercut both by considerable margins.It's admirable that Samsung has delivered a 6.4-inch, Full-HD+Super AMOLED panel in a $349/£309 phone. But what's truly impressive is how good the A50's screen is.It's not quite as sharp as the one in Google's recently launched midrange handset, as the Pixel 3a packs its, well, pixels a bit closer together over a smaller frame. But the A50 trounces it where brightness is concerned, while offering a selection of display modes that let you tune the colors to your preference. It looks like a flagship screen, and it's in a device that costs a third of the price.Although the Pixel 3a routinely bests it, the A50's camera can hold its own in ideal conditions.Watching the trailer for the upcoming Ford v Ferrari flick, the side of Ken Miles' iconic blue-and-white Ford GT40 glistened under the Daytona lights with an intensity that the Pixel 3a couldn't replicate. With a peak full-screen brightness of 574 nits to Google's 401 nits, the A50 wasn't even far off the S10's 611-nit result. And because the A50's panel is OLED, the glow of a Ferrari's yellow headlights against the moonlit sky over Le Mans captivated in a way it never would have on a similarly priced, LCD-powered phone.MORE: Apple's iPhone XS Max Has the Best Smartphone Display EverThe A50 received high marks in color gamut coverage. The screen's 192.8% of the sRGB space again split the difference between the Pixel 3a (182.3%) and the much more expensive Galaxy S10 (208.2%). Delta-E color accuracy testing proved less encouraging, as the A50's 0.74 score wasn't quite as good as the Pixel 3a's 0.18 (numbers closer to zero are better).For what it's worth, things didn't look wrong to my eye, simply more saturated. But again, Samsung offers alternative profiles in the settings that are more realistic than the default Dynamic tuning, so your mileage may vary.If anyone's camera could give Google's competition in the midrange segment, you'd figure it would be Samsung's. And the Galaxy A50's spec sheet would certainly back up that claim — this phone carries not one, not two, but a whopping three lenses on the back, even though it's about a third of the price of Samsung's other triple-lens phone, the Galaxy S10.Comprising that trifecta of cameras is a 25-megapixel, ƒ/1.7 main lens, an 8-MP ultrawide ƒ/2.2 lens, and another 5-MP sensor used purely to measure depth. The front of the phone packs yet another 25-MP shooter for crisp selfies — or, at least you'd hope.I don't know if it's a casualty of Samsung's image-processing software or what, but the A50's photography proved a bit blurrier than the Pixel 3a's in every scene I shot with both phones, even though on paper, the A50's main camera captures twice the number of megapixels.Take, for example, this scene of a windowsill within our New York office. I'm quite pleased with the A50's attempt overall, but the more you zoom in, the more those details — the specular highlights bouncing off the plant's pot, the texture of the leaves and the gold text on the spine of the sky-blue book — begin to muddle together.For what it's worth, the resulting shots from the A50 happen to be the same number of pixels as those from Google's handset — indicating work is happening behind the scenes to compress or bin the megapixels, perhaps to brighten the end result. There's no arguing the Galaxy's take on this cloudy outdoor scene is brighter than the Pixel's, though again, it comes at the expense of sharpness. The tree bark, the woodchips beneath it and the glass panes on buildings far away are all harder to discern in the A50's shot.Unfortunately, the results when the depth sensor comes into play are markedly less impressive. My colleague Jorge's face is hazy and smoothed over in the example from the Galaxy, even though beautification features were turned off. Additionally, the more pulled-back perspective doesn't work here — I prefer the Pixel 3a's vantage point, which crops in to stack the foreground and background more closely together, like you'd expect from a professionally taken portrait.Although the Pixel 3a routinely bests it, the A50's camera can hold its own in ideal conditions. That definitely is not the case when things get dark, however, as Samsung hasn't gifted this cheaper handset with the same Bright Night feature you'll find on the company's flagships. As a result, the A50 has no answer to Google's Night Sight, and is out of its depth in the near-pitch-black photo op you see above.Finally, I was quite disappointed from the selfie I took with the A50. My skin tone is more extreme, with oddly strong highlights and pinkish shadows. And again the sharpness is lacking when compared with the Pixel 3a's attempt. Samsung's camera did expose things more brightly, which was a plus — though I'm not sure it was worth the aforementioned trade-offs.The Exynos 9610 chipset that powers the Galaxy A50 is one we're not accustomed to seeing in many devices. Most of Samsung's handsets, especially in North America, employ Qualcomm Snapdragon power. The Exynos 9610 is a midrange system-on-a-chip that actually compares favorably with the Snapdragon 670 processor in the Pixel 3a.In fact, in terms of numbers, they're practically dead even. Where the Pixel 3a scored 5,146 in Geekbench 4 — a benchmark that measures overall system performance — the A50 finished at 5,200. And in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test, which focuses on graphical capabilities, the Pixel 3a churned out a 1,602 score, just above the A50's 1,359.So on paper, the A50 is evenly matched with the baby Pixel — though, of course, paper doesn't tell the whole story. And while I'm pleased to report Samsung's Galaxy-on-a-budget is a reliable all-around performance, you are likely to hit a few snags along the way.With prices rising and ownership time increasing, the world needs more accessible smartphones. It needs more phones like the A50.For example, the A50 hasn't always proved eager to get through the lock screen in my experience. Even when using PINs — taking the fingerprint sensor out of the equation — the device will hesitate to re-open the last used app. I ran into this a number of times while commuting and listening to Spotify. Although I wouldn't call it deal-breaking, it is something I rarely, if ever, encountered on the Pixel 3a.Otherwise, the A50 delivered a mostly stress-free experience, with no other hiccups to note. Multiwindow app usage was a breeze, and I logged in a satisfactory session of PUBG Mobile while the game was set to medium visual quality. Things slowed to a crawl and the back of the phone got a little toasty when I ratcheted everything up to flagship-caliber, HDR settings with anti-aliasing. Then again, no handset with a processor like those in the A50 or Pixel 3a is capable of running the latest mobile titles at maxed visuals.Samsung is finally packing larger and faster-charging batteries into all its phones, and the Galaxy A50 is no exception. Inside the device's slender metallic frame is a 4,000-mAh battery capable of 15-watt power delivery when using the stock adapter.In the Tom's Guide battery test, where the device was tasked with loading web pages over LTE until it ran out of juice, the A50 shut down after 9 hours and 37 minutes. That's not bad, though it seems a hair too short given how big the battery is. The Pixel 3a, comparatively, notched 12 hours, landing it on our list of phones with the longest battery life.MORE: Best Battery App - Battery Saving Apps for iPhone, AndroidAnd as for the fast-charging battery, it turns out it's not actually that speedy at all. We're not terribly surprised, given that 15 watts doesn't really qualify as ""fast"" in this day of 30- and 40-watt charging technologies from the likes of OnePlus and Huawei. As a result, the A50 hit only a pretty-average 17 percent in 15 minutes connected to the packed-in adapter, and 33 percent after a half hour.Like Samsung's more expensive phones, the Galaxy A50 runs the company's OneUI Android front-end. It's a divisive take on Google's operating system, to say the least, with large icons and a reshuffling of on-screen controls and text to the bottom of the screen, where it's easier to interact with on handsets with larger displays.The Galaxy A50 is a handset with a large display, so I'm happy to report that OneUI is more useful and elegant here than on, say, the diminutive, 5.8-inch Galaxy S10e. You also get the same additional features on this device that S10 users get, including Samsung's gesture-based navigation scheme that replaces Android's three-button design with swipe-up motions where each action used to be.Not everyone will like that approach to getting around; my colleague, Tom's Guide Editor-in-Chief Mark Spoonauer, wasn't particularly fond of it when he tested the Galaxy S10 Plus. At least it takes up less screen real estate than Google's strange mix of gestures and buttons on stock Android Pie.MORE: Galaxy A50 vs. Galaxy S10eWe expect the A50 to receive Android 10 at some point in 2020. Samsung, unfortunately, has never been known for delivering Android upgrades with any sort of urgency, and this being a midrange product at that, we feared the A50 would slip behind S- and Note-series devices on the company's priority list. However, in the months following release, Samsung has adopted a monthly security patch schedule for the A50, which makes us hopeful that big Android 10 update will arrive sooner rather than later.The Galaxy A50 is very good, and it's refreshing to see Samsung take the midrange market seriously — particularly in the U.S., where it has remained laser-focused on its Galaxy S and Note products. With phone prices rising and ownership time increasing, the world needs more accessible handsets. It needs more phones like the A50.But is it the best you can do for less than $400? Not quite. If you're keen on saving $50 and don't mind being tied to Verizon or Sprint, it's a great option. But the A50's camera, battery life and software in particular pale in comparison to the $399/£309 Pixel 3a, and Google's phone is also compatible with all carriers.Are those positives in Google's favor worth an extra $50? If you plan on holding onto your next smartphone for as long as possible, I'd definitely say so. But if you're not a fan of the Pixel 3a's more utilitarian design, need a bigger screen but the $479/£469 Pixel 3a XL is simply too expensive, or can take advantage of one of the aforementioned killer promotions (like getting the A50 for $10 a month for two years), this Galaxy is worth it — even if it narrowly misses the title of best-in-class."
125,Huawei Mate 30 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/huawei-mate-30-pro,"With the new Mate 30 Pro, Huawei looks to build on the success of last year's Mate 20 Pro phablet. The cameras, display and design have all undergone significant changes for the Mate 30 Pro, accompanied by new software features and hardware that round off the upgrade. But while the engineering may be innovative, there are good reasons to steer clear of this smartphone. First, Huawei's continuing problems with the U.S. government have given the Mate 30 the dubious honor of being barred from using Google apps. Second, as with recent Huawei phones, U.S. users will not be able to buy the Mate 30, although Huawei will likely sell the phone in the U.K. at a later date. These obstacles, plus a few smaller issues with the handset, are not unbeatable. But why bother when there are already fully functional Android phones that more readily available? You'll need to be truly in love with the Mate 30 Pro's hardware to pick this over a Galaxy Note 10 Plus or Google Pixel 4 XL.Editors' Note: We are reviewing a Chinese 4G version of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, which may differ from final 4G version or 5G version, both of which are expected to launch in Europe in the coming months.Huawei hasn't revealed release dates or prices yet. While the Mate 30 series was never expected to come to the U.S., we’re still hoping for a U.K. release as part of the wider European release, rumored to be happening later in November.At the Mate 30 Pro's launch event in September, Huawei said the phone would cost €1,099 for a handset with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage. That converts to $1,210/£971, although prices often adjust for regional taxes and other factors. The Mate 30 Pro makes a great first impression. The overflowing Horizon Display means there are no bezels on the left or right side of the phone, which, when combined with the back, make a complete smooth curve around the phone's body. Less appealing are the rather thick bezels on the top and bottom of the display, and there's a sizable notch in the top center, but I still think the Mate 30 Pro is a very attractive phone.Notches are becoming passé on some notable Android manufacturer's phones thanks to the addition of pop-up selfie cameras and punch-holes. But like Apple with the iPhone 11 series, Huawei's stuck with them, which has allowed the company to pack the front-camera array with some 3D-face-recognition technology to rival Apple's Face ID. The Mate 30 Pro's notch is smaller than the iPhone's, in part due to Huawei's removal of a top speaker for an sub-display assembly like the P30 Pro's. This cleans up the exterior, but at the expense of audio performance.The traditional camera-inspired shape of the Mate 30 series' back isn't as gimmicky as it sounds. While the rear cameras are mounted in a circular bump, accented with a halo ring with the flash located in the top left corner just like an old-fashioned camera, I find it a smart design on its own merits. Even with the printed text making sure you don't forget the phone is made by Huawei and packs Leica lenses, the Mate 30's frame looks modern without being elaborately detailed, which is backed up by the color options.There are four colors to pick from here: black, cosmic purple, emerald green (which additionally comes with a matte to gloss finish) and space silver, the color of my review unit. Since the camera bump is itself black, the black-bodied version lacks some of the contrast of the other three models, but all four color options look pretty good.The silver model I tested looked as wonderful and shiny as you would hope when you take it out of the box, but it picks up smudges at an irritatingly fast pace, much like the Aurora Glow-colored Galaxy Note 10. If you pick this phone, and particularly this color option, I would recommend finding a clear case to store your Mate 30 Pro, such as the one Huawei itself sells, to avoid turning the back of the phone into a fingerprint art gallery.The Mate 30 Pro feels small for the amount of screen space you get.The Mate 30 Pro's power button, colored in a contrasting metallic red on all models and located slightly less than halfway down the right side of the phone, has had to be pushed backward to make way for the horizon edges, so it won't sit in the center of your thumb or middle finger as it does on most phones. It's a peculiar feeling, as it means you have to hold the phone slightly tilted if you want to press the button — not something I'm comfortable doing with a $1,000 phone.The volume control on the Mate 30 Pro no longer exists as a physical switch. The controls are now activated by a double tap on either edge of the top third of the display where the buttons used to be. Although controlling the volume takes a little getting used to, it's very convenient to be able to adjust audio from both sides of the phone, and it stops Huawei from having to add another oddly located button.The Mate 30 Pro feels small for the amount of screen space you get. It's shorter and narrower than the Galaxy Note 10 Plus or the iPhone 11 Pro Max, while beating the iPhone on screen size. And although Huawei's phone is thicker than both of these other options, the Mate 30 Pro's curved display and back mean it still feels good to hold. It also weighs almost the same as the Note 10 Plus at 6.98 ounces, which I feel is the sensible limit for how heavy a phablet can be before you start noticing the extra mass.While featuring a slightly smaller display than the standard 6.62-inch Mate 30, the 6.53-inch OLED FHD+ panel on the Mate 30 Pro addresses the smaller screen size by extending the left and right sides of the display off the edges almost 90 degrees. This Horizon Display, as Huawei calls it, is quite astonishing to look at, even when you're just scrolling through the home pages.When you're watching videos, you don't notice that the screen isn't completely flat at the top and bottom. While watching some YouTube videos detailing fancy Devil May Cry 5 combos, the dark environments of the game showed up brightly, and the numerous tiny particle effects were  exceptionally crisp, too.One problem with the extreme curve appears when you are using the camera app. If you hold the display lower or higher than your normal sightline, the curve means you can't quite see where the edge of your photo is, so you can potentially cut things out of the shot. It's a minor problem, since you can always take another picture should you notice the error you've made, but it's something I imagine many potential users would run into and notice only when it was too late.On the plus side, the edge of the Mate 30 Pro's display still registers your touches, unlike some similar displays. As mentioned above, it has eliminated the need for a volume key, but it can also be used to control an extra shutter button for the camera, or generally to swipe and tap through apps.Regarding test results, the Mate 30 Pro's display, in its vivid color mode, manages 178.5% of the sRGB color gamut, which is far better than either the iPhone 11 Pro Max (118.6%) or the Note 10 Plus (124.6%), losing only to the OnePlus 7 Pro's 180%. The Mate 30 Pro's Delta-E score, which measures color accuracy  is 0.27, is roughly in line with the Note 10 Plus' 0.25 and the iPhone’s 0.28, but not as good as the 7 Pro's 0.18. (The smaller the number, the better the accuracy.) In the Mate 30 Pro's normal color profile, these results change, the display becoming less colorful (112.4% sRGB) but more accurate (0.21 Delta-E).The Mate 30 Pro's total average brightness came out as 396 nits, which is shockingly dim, since the iPhone 11 Pro Max managed 761 nits, and the Note 10 Plus 686 nits on the same test. I didn't notice a problem when using the Mate 30 Pro either indoors or outdoors in bright light, but it's interesting to discover that this excellent screen does have a weakness.Armed with a 40MP wide sensor, a 40MP ultrawide Cine sensor, an 8MP 3x optical telephoto sensor and a time-of-flight sensor, the Mate 30 Pro is ready for any photographic situation you could want to throw at it. So to give it the most rigorous test we could, we put it up against the recently released iPhone 11 Pro Max to see which multilens phone did the best.One of Huawei's favorite tricks to show off with its SuperSensing camera is how you can turn off all the lights in a room and still take decent pictures of whatever's there. The iPhone 11 Pro Max, which features Apple's new automatic Night Mode, produces a fairly true-to-life color out of this image of some wall art in pitch darkness, but the image is pretty noisy. The Mate 30 Pro's image, both in Night Mode (shown in all of these low-light comparisons) or in standard photo mode comes out a lot cleaner. That said, the colors in the Mate 30 Pro's images are not as good as what the iPhone produced, either coming out too warm in Night Mode or too cold in normal mode, compared to how I saw the scene with my own eyes.Taking the two phones out into Manhattan  after dark, we see a similar problem with this shot of Bryant Park. Although it's nice to have the option to manually swap modes with the Mate 30 Pro, you end up with an image that's either a little too dark or that's far too bright. The iPhone hits a happy medium between the two extremes.In Times Square, where there are lights everywhere, the gap between the phones is only slight. The Mate 30's Night Mode comes into its own here, helping the darker sidewalk pop just as much as the billboards. The iPhone 11 Pro Max's image is warmer, but I don't think either phone really stands out here. It seems that the Huawei thrives in extreme lighting conditions, while the Apple is tuned to work best with average amounts of light in a shot.When it's daylight, we start to see the weakness of the Mate 30 Pro's sensors. Being able to capture lots of light is all well and good, but not when you start to approach overexposure. Both of the images below are perfectly acceptable shots, but the iPhone gets the colors across more effectively.These portrait shots of TG's own Kate Kozuch tells a similar story. While both phones do a good job of blurring the background to create a bokeh effect, the Mate 30 Pro creates a far flatter looking image.The two phones have slightly different ultrawide angle lenses, but they're still comparable. Here we see a reversal of the overexposure problem, with the iPhone creating the brighter image, but one that still looks good. The Mate 30 Pro's colors are richer, and the angle's slightly tighter. As a result, neither phone outperforms the other on this particular shot.Comparing the two phones’ zoom abilities is tricky since they have different optical magnifications — 3x for the Mate 30 Pro, 2x for the iPhone 11. Therefore I tried both at 5x, requiring the two phones to use hybrid (simultaneous optical and digital) zoom, with a small flower as a subject.The difference between the two is surprising. The iPhone has the Mate 30 Pro beat on megapixels (12 to 8), but even so, the noise, light level and detail are all far worse on the Mate 30 than I would have expected. The only praise I can give to the Mate 30 is how vivid the pink petals look, but it's not enough to take the point from the iPhone 11.Turning to the selfie camera, I like how both photos turned out. I prefer the iPhone picture a little more since it looks more natural, but the Mate 30 Pro does the greatest justice to the beautiful day I took the phones out to take pictures with its additional brightness.As a bonus test, I headed out with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus to see how another Android phablet would perform in a couple of key photo situations. The results were very close indeed.In these mirrored selfie shots, I look a much healthier color in the Note 10's image than I do in the Mate 30's, even if that phone's higher resolution image does capture smaller details like my beard more effectively. It's the classic problem with selfies: Do I prefer the more accurate image or the more flattering one? There's not much in it, but I side with the Note 10 here.In a standard main sensor shot of the park, we see the Note 10 manages to squeeze more color and detail out of the scene, which you can see at the borders of the shadows in the image and in the clothing of the people in the foreground. It's a matter of taste again rather than a strict judgment, but once more I think the Note 10 does a better job.The Mate 30 Pro has a lot of tricks up its sleeve for photography, but hardware isn't everything. Apple and Samsung's processing software gives you much nicer photographs in general, even if in some specific settings Huawei's unique tuning gives it an edge. It's a toss-up between the Note 10 and the Mate 30 Pro for me, but if you're not an Android adherent, then the iPhone 11 Pro seems to be a better bet for consistent high-quality photo shooting; no wonder it's our pick for the best camera phone.Using the Kirin 990, which is Huawei's newest SoC, the Mate 30 series is going to set the pace for Huawei and Honor phones into 2020. The Mate 30 Pro pairs this with 8GB RAM, which is the most Huawei ever offers on its phones (excluding the 12GB RAM Porsche Design version of the Mate 30 Pro); even though some rivals, like the Galaxy Note 10 Plus, offer up to 12GB RAM as standard.On Geekbench 5, the Mate 30 Pro scored 772 on the single core test and 2,881 on the multicore test. This is better than the Note 10 Plus (736 and 2,691), but worse than the iPhone 11 Pro Max (1,334 and 3,517), which is to be expected. Apple's CPUs are always miles ahead of any of the ones Android phones typically use.We also performed some graphics tests, to see what the CPU plus the Mate 30 Pro's Mali-G76 GPU could manage in tandem. On 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme (OpenGL ES 3.1), the Mate 30 managed a score of 5,679, a touch worse than the Note 10 Plus' 5,781, but still a respectable performance. On GFXBench 5's Aztec Ruins (High Tier) Vulkan test, the Huawei managed 1,055 frames, which is just slightly worse than the Samsung's 1,058 frames, but a lot worse than the iPhone's 1,657 frames.The Mate 30 does have a stereo loudspeaker system, but the mismatching designs mean the volume is unbalanced, along with the EQ, which favors percussion and treble sounds. Watching the most recent trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order looks excellent on the display, but you lose out on the hum of lightsabers and the brass section of the orchestral soundtrack.The same audio issues can be found when playing the racing game Asphalt 9: Legends. None of it sounds bad, but you know that the revving engines would sound better on other phone's loudspeakers. Happily, the fast-moving graphically intensive game does show off the GPU well. It processes the action excellently, and with only a small amount of additional heat coming from the top corner of the phone.Thanks to the U.S.-China trade war, and the U.S. government's blacklisting of Huawei, Google had to withdraw its support from Huawei's devices. Although the Mate 30 series is still allowed to run the open-source Android operating system, it doesn't have any of the Android mainstays like Gmail or YouTube pre-installed, nor does it have the Play Store to let you download those apps yourself.The lack of Google apps on the Mate 30 Pro can't be avoided, nor can the implications for the average potential buyer.On the surface, the Mate 30 Pro, running on Android 10 via Huawei's EMUI 10 launcher, looks like any other Android phone on its home screens and settings menus. But with no Play Store, your source of apps will have to be Huawei's App Gallery storefront, which, at least on my Chinese pre-release handset, was not tuned for global users. After switching the App Gallery to the U.K. version, which requires a Huawei ID login, you'll still not recognize many of the apps available. Those you will spot are Chinese-tailored versions of browsers like Firefox and Opera, which work as normal except they feature a lot of Chinese text and are not optimized for Western internet mainstays like YouTube.During our tests, we used a third-party website named LZPlay to download the Play Store onto the Mate 30 Pro. It allowed us to try out the phone with a familiar set of apps, but this is not a true solution to the problem for normal users. For one, the site has since been taken down, and given that LZPlay required you to give numerous permissions in order to install the files, it wouldn't be safe to use this on your own personal device.Google has also shut down SafetyNet, its app authentication and security system, on the Mate 30, meaning that even if you download Google apps onto the Mate 30 Pro by other means, they still wouldn't work as they lack Google's signature to permit them to do so.You could make do with the built-in Huawei browser, email client and so forth, while hoping that Huawei improves the App Gallery experience for users outside of China. But as it stands, the lack of Google apps can't be avoided, nor can the implications for the average potential buyer.Thanks to its tricked-out front-camera array, the Mate 30 Pro recognizes more than just the presence of your face. It can read the angle of your eyes, which means that device's auto-rotation follows both the phone's internal gyroscope and how you're positioned. You can lie on your side or get up while holding the phone and still have the screen oriented like you had it before; you can also turn the phone around while holding it flat and have it swap orientations. It's only a small annoyance when other phones swap or don't change at unwanted moments, but impressively, Huawei seems to have eliminated that problem. More notably, the Huawei Mate 30 Pro includes Air Gestures, which attempt to steal the Google Pixel 4's gesture-control thunder by letting you scroll up and down pages and take screenshots by moving and clenching your hand, respectively. They're fun to use, and fun to see how other people react to you using them, but I don't think they're that useful.After initially struggling to getting the Mate 30 Pro's front-camera array to register the presence of my hand, I eventually got the hang of things and could easily scroll up and down pages. But even if you can move through menus and web pages without touching the phone, you can only scroll a single fixed distance at a single fixed speed with each motion, rather than having the freedom to alter both as you please when you use the touch screen. Longer pages became a tedious slog with this feature, so I stopped using it. I like the screenshot feature more, since it's a simpler operation that does feel marginally quicker than navigating to the appropriate button in the Quick Settings bar.While a cool addition overall, Huawei's Air Gestures needs greater versatility before it becomes a killer feature for the phone. And even though the Pixel 4's own Motion Sense gestures aren't superb, they seem slightly more useful than what Huawei has so far.To unlock the Mate 30 Pro, your two primary options are a sub-display fingerprint sensor, or face unlocking. I had no problems with either method, although having a fast and secure Face ID rival on an Android phone is a rare treat, since most facial recognition systems on Android are based only on image rather than the more secure infra-red dot projection. It takes about the same amount of time to open the Mate 30 Pro as an iPhone 11 (lift up the phone, wait a beat for your face to be recognized, swipe up on the screen), but the Pixel 4 is definitely faster thanks to its Motion Sense radar noticing your hand reaching for it and preparing its unlock.Face unlocking takes about the same amount of time to open the Mate 30 Pro as an iPhone 11, but the Pixel 4 is definitely faster than both.The Mate 30 Pro's approach works from multiple angles and in various light conditions, and once you're registered, it only takes a swipe upward to get into your phone. That makes face unlock on the Mate 30 Pro just as quick as entering a PIN or using a fingerprint.Speaking of which, the Mate 30 Pro's fingerprint reader is an optical model that we've seen on previous Huawei smartphones. It remains one of the faster unlocking examples that I've found on smartphones released this year, but with the face unlock ability I didn't need to use it much.Purely from the specs, we had high hopes for the Mate 30 Pro's battery performance. At 4,500mAh, the new phone's battery has 200mAh more than the Note 10 Plus, and over 500mAh more than the iPhone 11 Pro Max (at least according to unofficial teardowns). In our custom battery test, which involves browsing the internet over a 4G LTE data signal at 150 nits screen brightness until the phone switches off, the Mate 30 Pro made it to 12 hours and 44 minutes. That's nearly an hour longer than the iPhone 11 Pro Max's 11 hours and 54 minutes, and more than 1.5 hours longer than the Galaxy Note 10 Plus' 11 hours and 9 minutes, making the Huawei one of the longest-lasting phones we've tested, and certainly a top performer among premium phablets.When it comes to charging, the 40W wired SuperCharge plug that comes in the box with the Mate 30 Pro certainly lives up to its name. It gets you to 37% battery capacity in 15 minutes, and 67% in 30 minutes, which is plenty for a day of moderate usage. The default 25W charger for the Note 10 Plus manages 26% and 47% at 15 and 30 minutes, respectively, while the 18W iPhone 11 Pro charger gets to 48% after 30 minutes.You also get wireless charging with the Mate 30 Pro, up to 27W if you use one of Huawei's own charging pads. We tested this with one of the aforementioned official wireless chargers (which are also awaiting an official release date for the U.K.), and managed 24% after 15 minutes, and 44% after 30 minutes. Don't expect that kind of speed from a generic wireless charger, though.Like Samsung's latest flagships, the Huawei Mate 30 Pro offers reverse wireless charging, in case you want to donate some power to someone with a dead phone or you need to top up your wireless accessories.It's incredibly annoying to find a phone with excellent specs, tech and engineering brought down by circumstances beyond its control. Yet this is where the Mate 30 Pro finds itself — a stunning Android handset with potential that you can barely make the most of because you can't get the apps you want to use on it. There's also the matter of the Mate 30 Pro's cameras, which don't really distinguish themselves from the top camera phones. The Mate 30 Pro's strongest showings come in weird shooting situations, while it's bested by rival phones in the more standard-shot compositions we tested.It's impressive that the Mate 30 Pro still managed to turn out OK despite the odds against it. Nonetheless, the availability issues, and the block on Google and Play Store usage, mean it's impossible to recommend this phone to any user willing to spend $1,000. An iPhone 11 Pro Max would be an excellent alternative, or perhaps a Note 10 Plus or a OnePlus 7 Pro if you want the best Android phone available. But if you demand top hardware no matter what else you have to give up, then you're the closest to a perfect match for the Mate 30 Pro."
126,Honor 9X,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/honor-9x,"Wanting a cheap phone and a large phone don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Google’s Pixel 3a XL is easily the best example of that, thanks to its fairly spacious 6-inch display while delivering efficient performance for $479. But Huawei-owned Honor thinks you can go even bigger and even cheaper.Enter the Honor 9X, which gives you an additional half an inch of display for £249  (around $320). It's just as well, as some of the 9X’s other specs simply don’t match those of rival budget phones.  Despite some missing features, the Honor 9X is a a solid  phablet for someone who isn’t concerned about the latest and greatest from fancier phones.In the UK, the single 4GB RAM and 128GB storage model costs £249, and has been in sale from Nov. 13. You will be able to get it from various retailers including Honor's own site, Amazon and Argos, and can order it now from Carphone Warehouse.Unfortunately, this phone isn’t coming to the US via your normal phone store. That means U.S. shoppers would have to buy an unlocked version online while making sure that the phone’s compatible with their wireless carrier’s network. That’s an awful lot of hoops to jump through in the U.S. when comparable phones to the Honor 9X are readily available.Lifting the 9X out of its smart white box, the phone feels surprisingly premium. The chassis’ materials —  particularly the 3D glass back — give the impression of a more expensive handset, particularly when you compare it to the polycarbonate body of the Pixel 3a. Still, the 9X’s build quality doesn’t match Google’s, symbolised by the large seams between the back and front panels of the 9X, which are large enough to pinch your fingers a little when you run your hand over them.The Sapphire Blue color option of my review unit is definitely the one you want if you buy this phone, as it’s the only one that comes with the “Dynamic X Design“ on the back. The back of the phone looks only slightly textured under low to average lighting, but when you catch a bright light, you’ll see an X-shaped pattern made of tiny diamond-shaped elements appear on the back of the phone. The 9X’s Midnight Black colorway is just a plain glossy surface; far more subtle but a lot less interesting to look at.The only things breaking up the X design are the rear center-mounted fingerprint reader and the rear camera array and flash tucked into the top left corner. The back panel is also curved, which adds to the good looks of the 9X while letting it sit nicely in your hand.There’s not much to talk about from the front. The 9X’s display is notch-free, but thre’s a very noticeable chin bezel and a smaller forehead containing the call speaker. Without the punch-hole notch found on the Honor 20 Pro or View 20, the 9X doesn’t look like a 2019 Honor handset.Around the edges, you’ll find the usual power and volume buttons on the right side, the pop-up camera module (a first for Honor) and SIM tray on the top, and on the bottom a speaker grille, USB-C port and, perhaps most excitingly for some, a good old-fashioned 3.5mm headphone jack. If you’re a tech user on a tight budget, chances are you have yet to invest in wireless headphones, so it’s smart of Honor to keep this feature on the 9X.The mammoth 6.59-inch FHD LCD display is why this phone has such an intimidating size. It’s a lot of real estate for the price, particularly when you consider it comes without a notch or punch-hole. Using LCD instead of OLED helps keep the price down, but does mean you’ll lose out on overall image quality.Watching the final trailer for Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker on the 9X’s screen was pretty average. The images of the Resistance or Rey fighting Kylo Ren were rather muddy. A brighter recipe video instructing you how to make shakshuka was at least colorful, but still suffered from a lack of definition.You would expect that the Pixel 3a, with its OLED display, would have a higher maximum brightness than the 9X. This isn’t the case however. The Pixel 3a maxes out at around 400 nits, while Honor claims the 9X can go up to 480 nits. That’s still a little dim compared to many other phones, but it seems that at the cheaper end of smartphones, the 9X shows that LCD still produces a competitive screen.There are three cameras on the back of the 9X: a 48-MP main sensor, an 8-MP ultra-wide sensor with a 120-degree field-of-view and a 2-MP depth assist sensor. (You would be within reason to argue that this one doesn’t count as a camera on its own.) There’s no telephoto lens to round out the holy trinity of 2019 camera functions, but it’s understandable at the price: Honor has only put a zoom lens on its flagship 20 Pro, which costs twice as much as the 9X.I took the 9X and the Google Pixel 3a out for daytime and nighttime photo comparisons. Although the Pixel 3a isn’t the same size as the Pixel 3a XL, the more relevant competitor to the 9X, the camera software and hardware is identical, so the comparison remains fair.In this normal shot of Covent Garden, the Pixel 3a’s image is notably colder than the 9X’s image. While sometimes a cold image can be a bad sign, here it’s a more accurate depiction of the very bright day.The Honor wins by default in the ultra-wide-angle shot competition simply because the single-lens Pixel 3a doesn’t have one. The only problem is that the ultra-wide lens on the 9X is only 8MP, which is fairly low resolution and therefore produces so-so shots at best.For the pictures I took of this muffin, I switched the 9X’s settings so it took images at its full 48-MP instead of the usual 12-MP resolution, which it does to save memory and to allow for digital zoom and other photo functions. This resulted in a far brighter image than the one produced by the 12.2 megapixels that the Pixel 3a manages. The two different shots make different parts of this baked treat look better — the cake itself on the Honor, the jam topping on the Google. Whichever picture you prefer, it shows that under the right circumstances the 9X can take photos with the best of them.Sadly, the 9X isn't suited for low-light photography. Taking it and the Pixel 3a out to Kings Cross one evening, the Honor is neither effective at dealing with bright light sources, nor at revealing detail hidden in the darkness. A big contributor to this is that you can only use night mode at an 8MP resolution, unlike the Pixel 3a which lets you use its maximum 12.2MP in its Night Sight mode.These narrow boats show up fairly well, making what was a scene lit only by distant lights on the other side of the canal look like a grim afternoon. However, the Pixel 3a conjures up something that looks like it was taken during a bright day. If you were looking for something that still looked like it was taken at night, maybe the Honor is more to your taste, but I really like how the Google phone was able to show me colors and detail I never would have been able to with my own eyes.The two phones are more evenly matched in this wide open scene with a mix of dark and bright spots, but once again the Pixel 3a brings out the details and color much more than the 9X achieves, with the Honor also capturing large flares from the bright spotlights illuminating the square in front of Kings Cross Station.MORE: Motorola Razr 2019 Rumors: Release Date, Price and SpecsThe pop-up module is a new housing for Honor’s 16-MP front camera The module contains fall, pressure dust and splash protection to make sure it doesn’t get damaged. It is a little slow to open and close, however, due in part to the length of the module, which could cause you a problem if you wanted to quickly take a selfie snapshot.The two phones fare well with normal selfie shots. The Pixel 3a does its normal post-processing magic and gives me a healthy looking skin color while the Honor 9X shows my face in its more natural state. The scene behind me looks much better on the Pixel, though, which helps sway my opinion in its favor in this caseNeither phone does a brilliant job with portrait mode enabled. The Pixel 3a crops too wide, including some of the building behind me in the non-blurred area, while the 9X crops too closely, trimming the sides of my head and part of my ears. I don’t really like either one because of these faults, but if I had to choose a favorite, I’d side with the Pixel 3a again.This was a hard test for the Honor 9X, as the Pixel 3a is a stunning photography phone for its price. It holds up fairly well when you stick to the main rear sensor, but using the wide angle or selfie cameras or using night mode shows a greater quality gap against Google’s.To answer the biggest question you may have about the 9X — yes, it runs Google apps. Honor is owned by Huawei, who is currently on a US government black list that prevents U.S. companies from selling it hardware or software, and that’s affected Huawei’s relationship with Google. It’s the reason why the Mate 30 can use the Android operating system, but not the Google Play Store. However, because the 9X was first released in China before the ban came into force, you can still get all your favorite Android apps on the 9X with the version of the phone sold in other countries.The operating system is not Honor’s own Magic UI, which it saves for its higher end models, but Huawei’s EMUI 9.1, which means you get an Android 9 Pie user experience. There is nothing wrong with Android 9, even if Android 10 gives you more and better features, but you do get a host of Huawei bloatware apps along for the ride, which you likely won’t find all that useful. Some examples include Huawei Video and Huawei Music, which are media players requiring little explanation, or the App Gallery and Honor Store, which sell you apps and Honor products respectively.  However, Party Mode, which allows you to connect Honor phones together and play music through them simultaneously is a fun idea, allowing you to crowd-source a surround sound system if you have enough friends with compatible devices.The UI may not be so distinct as an Honor product, but it works as well as it ever did, with pleasant app and background designs, and the option to swap between having an app drawer or just a home screen, and between two/three virtual buttons or gesture navigation. Honor is pushing the presence of GPU Turbo 3.0, its own gaming optimization software that works with over 20 popular titles to squeeze the best performance out of the phone, and of the AI Signal Enhancer to keep you connected to your multiplayer game by switching between the phone’s antennas to quickly recover a lost signal. These are both good features to have, but if you’re planning on doing a lot of gaming you may want to consider a more powerful phone than the 9X.Honor is still promising Android security updates for its phones, but it’s not saying for how long. Be aware that if you buy this phone that you may end up without Google support unless the US-China trade war suddenly resolves and Huawei finds itself back in the U.S. government’s good graces.The 9X only has one set of internal specs options: a Kirin 710 processor, 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. It means that the 9X isn’t a powerhouse phone, but that’s still enough for everyday use and then some.Trying out Asphalt 9: Legends was not as bad as you may think. Sure, there’s a graphical downgrade that makes all the car models look a bit jagged around the edges, but the game still runs smooth and responds to the touch controls without delay. The 9X managed to stay pretty cool during my play session, too, despite the heavy processing that would have been going on.The 9X falls down on synthetic benchmarks. It scores 1,292 on the Geekbench 5 multicore test, and a paltry 873 on the OpenGL ES 3.1 Sling Shot Extreme benchmark by 3DMark, which goes up to 991 when you turn on the phone’s performance mode. For comparison, the Pixel 3a, which uses a Snapdragon 670 chip, fares a lot better. It manages a 1,352 multicore score on Geekbench 5 and 1,602 in the OpenGL Sling Shot Extreme benchmark. It’s a large gap for sure.The 9X is powered by a 4,000 mAh battery, which is only beaten in size at this price bracket by the Moto G7 Power’s 5,000 mAh cell, which is to be expected from a phone that focuses on battery life.After performing my usual test of watching videos until the battery dies, the 9X survived  about 10 hours of constant YouTube streaming with a little power still left in the tank. It joins a lengthening list of phones released this year that you could happily charge only every two days if you were careful with how you used itThe Honor 9X charges up via a 10W fast charger, which is on the slower end of the rapid charging wattage spectrum, but performs well enough. It manages a 16% charge from empty after 15 minutes, and 29% after 30 minutes. That’s slower than the Pixel 3a’s 18W charger, but the 300 mAh extra capacity in the 9X over the 3a XL means that you hopefully won’t need to charge as regularly.An ideal Honor 9X user would be someone who wants the most hardware they can get for the smallest price. It’s an efficient device with enough premium detailing to make it feel as special as devices two or three times its price. There are obvious weaknesses with the Honor 9X, including a camera that falls flat in low light and just so-so performance.. However, the large notchless display, good battery life and solid camera performance (in normal lighting conditions) make this one of the better Android values we’ve tested.If you can stretch to a Pixel 3a or Pixel 3a XL, you’re probably better off doing so. Aside from offering better cameras than the Honor 9X, these can use Android 10, are available in the US and aren’t at risk from suddenly losing out on Google’s support due to international politics. But if you want a larger display for less money, the Honor 9X is worth a look."
127,Motorola One Zoom,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-one-zoom,"""Midrange camera phone"" sounds like an oxymoron, but with four lenses on the back and a monster, 48-megapixel sensor at the helm, that's exactly what the $449 Motorola One Zoom aims to be.To some degree, Motorola's new phone succeeds. You'd have to spend hundreds more on a flagship from OnePlus or Samsung to get a phone with both ultrawide and telephoto shooters like the Motorola One Zoom has. However, the Zoom's versatility doesn't necessarily translate to great images in every scenario. The result is a decently well-rounded midrange contender, albeit one that doesn't quite find a home among the best camera phones or the best smartphones overall.The Motorola One Zoom costs $449 and is sold unlocked from Motorola and Amazon. The phone works on only GSM-based carriers, like T-Mobile, AT&T, Metro and Cricket — meaning those who belong to CDMA networks, like Verizon and Sprint, are out of luck here.There's only one configuration of the Motorola One Zoom, and it comes with 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. The device also accepts microSD cards up to 1TB in size, allowing you to store even more apps, games and media.At a hair more than 6.2 inches tall and a little less than 3 inches wide, the Motorola One Zoom is more imposing than most midrange phones. In fact, it's easier to draw parallels in size with the 6.5-inch iPhone 11 Pro Max than with other devices in the One Zoom's price range.The Motorola One Zoom is admittedly a bit easier to use one-handed than Apple's 6.22 x 3.06 x 0.32-inch iPhone, on account of the Zoom's slightly narrower frame. But make no mistake: The One Zoom is not ideal for those eyeing a more pocketable next phone.This phone is also considerably flashier than most Motorola devices, with its massive, rectangular rear-camera bump and faux-brushed-metal back that actually consists of glass. The phone's quartet of lenses are housed above a Motorola batwing logo that illuminates while you use the device or when a notification rolls in. It's a clever idea for alerts, but the rest of the time, it looks sort of silly (though it does make me long for the return of notification lights).The matte treatment on the rear glass does feel nice to the touch, though it also makes the One Zoom more slippery than a bar of soap. There are other quirks, too, like the lone speaker positioned on the top of the chassis, rather than the bottom or within the screen's bezels, as you'd typically expect.MORE: The 10 best Android phones of 2019If you can look past the huge quad-lens module, the One Zoom resembles your run-of-the-mill Android phone, with a rounded metal frame, a semi-awkward-looking teardrop notch in the center of the display and few discernible features when viewed head on. I wouldn't call it a particularly attractive piece of technology, but at least it's functional. Motorola has preserved the headphone jack on the One Zoom, and the phone's OLED display conceals an optical fingerprint scanner, which doesn't appear to be as finicky as similar sensors in other cheap phones we've come across.Subpar displays are rare in smartphones these days, and if you do happen upon a handset with a screen that isn't the best, the complaints typically relate to brightness.Indeed, the Motorola One Zoom's 6.4-inch OLED panel isn't the brightest out there, with a peak brightness of 403 nits. That's about even with the 401 nits on the Pixel 3a, which also happens to utilize an OLED screen, and the result is more or less consistent with what you see from other midrange devices. Sadly, if you want a really bright display, you still have to shell out around twice as much and get a flagship product.But that's not my biggest gripe with the Motorola One Zoom's screen. Rather, my issue lies with the grainy, card stock-like appearance of solid colors, which we haven't observed on an OLED panel in quite some time. I didn't notice it right away, but once I did, it was impossible to unsee and strongly compromised the sharpness of text and on-screen graphics in general.The Motorola One Zoom offers a selection of three color profiles: Natural, Boosted and Saturated. But a cool, bluish cast pervades all of them, making the screen look like it shares more with LCD panels than OLEDs. The Motorola One Zoom covers 208.7% of the sRGB color space but registered a Delta-E accuracy score of just 0.46 (numbers closer to zero are better), indicating overly vivid, unrealistic hues. The Pixel 3a, for comparison's sake, notched much stronger results of 182.3% and 0.18, respectively.It's unfortunate that the Motorola One Zoom's screen is so middling across the board. OLED displays still aren't common in sub-$500 handsets, so the one in this device could have made it seem like a steal. Instead, the Motorola One Zoom stands a cruel reminder that not all OLED panels are created the same.The Motorola One Zoom's crown jewel is its 48-megapixel main camera. With an ƒ/1.7 aperture and the ability to meld four megapixels into one, this sensor is primed to deliver shots with increased light sensitivity in the dimmest conditions.However, that's not the only camera on the back of this handset — far from it. Next door, you'll find a 16-MP ultrawide shooter with a 117-degree field of view, an 8-MP telephoto lens that supports a 3x optical zoom and a 5-MP depth sensor designed to ascertain more-precise bokeh when taking shallow-depth-of-field portraits.The upshot of all these optics is perhaps the most versatile camera phone selling for under $500. The Pixel 3a still has the Motorola One Zoom licked in overall photo quality, but there are certain perspectives that the Pixel 3a cannot match, because Google's device is limited to one lens.Take, for example, these portraits of my colleague Rami inside Tom's Guide's studio. Sure, the Pixel 3a's version is more traditional and technically better; there's more detail in Rami's face, the background has a satisfying blur to it, and the highlights and shadows are equally well lit. But I'm in awe of the Motorola One Zoom's more dramatic, pulled-back perspective, which really places the subject front and center, darkening the space around him. Wider-angle portraits really lend themselves well to this kind of vignetting, and the depth sensor appears to have helped here.The Motorola One Zoom's Night Vision mode isn't quite as refined as Google's, adopting a ham-fisted approach to contrast and sharpening that results in an over-processed look. The bed of leaves is drained of color, while the tree trunks look almost as though they've been lifted from a splotchy watercolor painting. Given the Motorola One Zoom's relatively low price, we suspect that most customers would still prefer to have Night Vision as an option, faults and all. It's just far from the best implementation we've seen of such technology.But then, the Pixel 3a has no answer to the Motorola One Zoom's ultrawide lens, which captured a semi-impressive shot of Bryant Park's iconic ice-skating rink beneath an autumn sky at dusk. As with many cheaper ultrawide phone cameras, there's a fair bit of distortion along the fringes in the One Zoom's photo, and the passersby nearest in the shot are rendered as murky, fast-moving smears. But the lighting is decent, and even if the Motorola One Zoom's ultrawide shooter can't compare to the iPhone 11's, it's not offensively off the mark for what you're paying.Neither is Motorola's 3x telephoto lens, which will help you close in on objects off in the distance, though it adds some graininess. It's important to point out that while the Pixel 3a lacks optical zoom of its own, Google somewhat makes up for that shortcoming with the Super Res Zoom algorithm. Then again, while the Pixel 3a's rendition is unquestionably smoother than the Zoom's, it obscures finer details that Motorola's optics manage to catch.Finally, there's the Motorola One Zoom's 25-MP front-facing camera, which also employs Quad Pixel technology to deliver lower-resolution (6-MP) images that are better optimized to let light in. While there's nothing objectionable about Motorola's work here, 6 megapixels may be a bit too limiting in this day and age, when most smartphone cameras capture selfies of at least 8 megapixels. Ultimately, I'm not dissatisfied with the results, though the Pixel 3a's rendition still edges ahead, with more-realistic coloring and highlights that aren't as blown out.You won't find a flagship-caliber Snapdragon 855 processor inside the Motorola One Zoom. Rather, this phone makes do with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 675 system on chip and 4 GB of RAM.Still, that's a strong combination for a midrange handset, and slightly more power than you get from the Pixel 3a, which utilizes slower, older Snapdragon 670 silicon. The Motorola One Zoom's speed advantage isn't significant, though it does ensure a fast and smooth user experience for practically everything except hardcore gaming.Mind you, some titles will run choppier than others. PUBG Mobile is a stress-free experience on most phones, and the same is true on the Motorola One Zoom. In fact, I was impressed by the device's ability to handle the battle-royale shooter on its more taxing graphical settings. Even with anti-aliasing on and the frame rate set to high, the action remained mostly free of slowdowns. But then, I couldn't say the same for the much more demanding Asphalt 9: Legends.MORE: The Best Android Racing GamesThe Motorola One Zoom's multicore Geekbench 5 score of 1,600 bested the Pixel 3a's mark of 1,321. But the Zoom's result seriously pales in comparison to what you get from 855-powered devices, like the $499 ZTE Axon 10 Pro, which produced a score of 2,666. On the flip side, the Pixel 3a topped the Motorola One Zoom in 3DMasrk's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test by a pretty wide margin: 1,602 to 981.With such a large display, you'd hope the Motorola One Zoom would have a suitably large battery to match. And at 4,000 mAh, it's certainly no lightweight.However, we had expected a bit more longevity than what we observed when we ran the phone through Tom's Guide's custom battery test. The Motorola One Zoom delivered 10 hours and 14 minutes of web surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network at 150 nits of screen brightness.MORE: Best Phone Battery Life - Longest Lasting Smartphone BatteriesThat's not only noticeably less than the Pixel 3a's time (11:59), but also below the showing from the iPhone 11 (11:16). In fact, the Motorola One Zoom lasted exactly as long as the 855-powered Axon 10 Pro.Paradoxically, the Motorola One Zoom doesn't actually run Android One software, at least not in the U.S.That's more than a little confusing, so let's unpack exactly what the change means. Handsets included in Google's Android One program are committed to pure installations of Google's mobile OS, devoid of the extraneous front ends, graphics and apps that phone makers typically add in.Some users prefer this stripped-down, lighter interpretation of Android, though the real benefit lies in how quickly and how often Android One devices are updated. Because Google vets the software, these phones tend to be among the first to receive major new releases of Android when they come out. While previous Motorola One devices ran Android One software, the latest from the company — like the Zoom here, as well as the Motorola One Action — notably lack it in the U.S.It's not totally clear why Motorola decided this change was necessary, though it's hard to interpret it as anything other than a loss for its American customers. Without Android One onboard, the Motorola One Zoom is still relegated to Android 9 Pie, while awaiting an update to Android 10. There's a good chance it won't receive an update to Android 11 after that, because Motorola guarantees only one major upgrade for its cheaper phones. Long-term security patches are less certain as well.MORE: Android 10 Review: An Update in ProgressOne of the Pixel 3a's less talked-about advantages is that it offers buyers on a budget the kind of first-class Android experience typically extended only to flagship users. As a Pixel 3a owner, you can be certain you'll get three years of immediate updates to future iterations of Android, with all the latest and greatest features those updates afford, so long as your hardware can handle them.Motorola One Zoom customers won't be able to say the same. Modern conveniences, like Google's new gesture-based navigation system and Night Theme, are still missing here. In fact, Motorola is still forcing users to go with its proprietary One-Button Nav scheme instead. One-Button Nav might've sufficed at a time when Android lacked gestures of its own, but today it's confounding to use, now that other phone makers have begun adopting Google's more streamlined approach.The Motorola One Zoom is a valiant attempt at bringing flagship mobile-photography features down to a more affordable price. However, it's still not the best camera phone you can get for less than $500.That title still belongs to Google's Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL and likely will until Motorola catches up to Google's computational photography prowess. The Motorola One Zoom touts a mess of high-resolution sensors and a plethora of optics, but the Pixel 3a shines because of software, not hardware.That's not to say that it isn't fun to shoot with the Motorola One Zoom's ultrawide lens or that this phone isn't a better-than-average mobile camera for the money. It's just not the best. And in other respects, the Motorola One Zoom struggles to stand out, with a merely passable design, a disappointing screen, good but not especially notable performance and battery life that's serviceable but not that much better than the average.Those looking for better photos would be wise to opt for the Pixel 3a, while anyone wishing for more power is advised to stretch their budget and land ZTE's Axon 10 Pro, or perhaps even the OnePlus 7T if they can part with $599. The Motorola One Zoom is an acceptable alternative to all of those devices, but it's also full of compromises you shouldn't have to make."
128,iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-7-iphone-7-plus,review-3908.html","Now that they've been around for a few years, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are no longer sold by Apple directly, but these phones are available through carriers as well retailers as unlocked phones. The iPhone 7 now starts at $349, while the larger iPhone 7 Plus costs $449, making them a good choice for anyone looking for a cheap iPhone.And for that money, you get pretty solid cameras (especially on the dual-lens iPhone 7 Plus), bright displays, responsive performance for apps and games from Apple's A10 Fusion chip and water-resistant bodies. The battery life is good, too, though the iPhone 7 Plus lasts longer on a charge.The newer iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus offer better cameras, more storage, faster processing and perks like wireless charging, but those on a tight budget should be satisfied with the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus.See our best phones page to see all of our top picks for every budget.With the exception of two new color options, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus look nearly the same as their predecessors, but at least they can take more abuse.Apple banished the unsightly antenna bands on the back of the handset, relegating them to the edges. It makes for a cleaner look, but if you want an iPhone that actually looks new, you’ll probably want to skip the Silver, Gold and Rose Gold and opt for the Black or Jet Black option.The high-gloss Jet Black iPhone 7 I tested is a real head-turner, like a flattened, shiny Darth Vader helmet. The back does show finer scratches and fingerprint smudges more readily than other finishes, so you'll want to pick up a case (go with clear). The regular matte black iPhone 7 Plus I reviewed has a no-nonsense, executive-chic vibe.I enjoyed — maybe too much — spilling a lot of water on the iPhone 7 and then dunking it in a pitcher.Thanks to its IP67 water resistance, the iPhone 7 can survive being submerged in 1 meter (or about 3 feet) of water for 30 minutes. That's not quite as good as what Samsung promises for the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge — 5 feet of water for 30 minutes — but it's better than previous iPhones, which could be done in by an unexpected splash.I enjoyed — maybe too much — spilling a mug of water on the iPhone 7 and then dunking it in a water pitcher. After wiping off the screen it worked just fine. Just keep in mind that Apple designed this feature not as a party trick but as a way to prevent accidental damage.Up front, Apple upgraded the display on the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch Plus to be up to 25 percent brighter than last year's iPhones, while showing a wider color gamut. A group of reds, yellow, light greens and purple heirloom tomatoes looked more vibrant on the new display versus the iPhone 6s. However, the iPhone 7 doesn't support HDR like the Galaxy Note 7, which delivers more natural colors and higher contrast in services like Amazon Video.My issue with the iPhone's design is that it doesn't look as fresh or as sexy as the curved Galaxy S7 Edge or Note 7. Just as important, there's more bezel around the iPhone 7's screen, so l had to stretch my thumb farther across the screen on the Plus to reach app icons and type with one hand. The bezel is less of an issue with the smaller 4.7-inch iPhone 7.At the risk of sounding like an iApologist, no, it's not. Or at least, it won't be for long.Wireless is the future, and Apple is clearly trying to push us in that direction with the AirPods and AirPods Pro. And there are several other great options on our best wireless earbuds list.So what about everyone else who hasn't gone wireless? First, Apple includes EarPods in the box that connect to the iPhone 7's Lightning port (the same you use for charging). They're hard and not very comfortable to wear, but they also deliver pleasingly balanced audio. MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowJust keep in mind that you can't charge your iPhone and listen at the same time unless you use an accessory like the iPhone Lightning Dock ($49) at your desk or Belkin's Lightning Audio + Charge Rockstar ($39) on the go.Second, Apple also throws a Lightning-to-3.5mm headphone adapter in the box, which you can just leave attached to your favorite wired headphones. Just don't lose this little sucker; it's $9 to replace.Speaking of audio, I'm glad Apple added a second speaker on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus — one speaker is at the top of the phone, while the other is on the bottom. The pulsing beat and vocals on ""Don't You Want Me"" came through much louder on the newer phone than my iPhone 6.Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus feature a new 12-megapixel camera that delivers excellent performance in low light — a weakness of the iPhone 6s. There's two reasons for this: a wider f 1/1.8 aperture lets in more light, compared with f 2/2.2 on the previous phones, and Apple finally gave both the 7 and 7 Plus optical image stabilization, which improves exposure while minimizing hand shake. (Previously, only the Plus phones had OIS.) In a low-light photo I took of some colleagues using both my old iPhone 6 and the iPhone 7 Plus, the latter shot exhibited much less grain when I zoomed in, and colors were more natural-looking. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus also benefit from a new Quad-LED flash, which is 50 percent brighter than the flash in the iPhone 6s.Outdoors, the iPhone 7 really shined, such as in this shot of a pink hibiscus flower. When I zoomed in, I could easily make out the veins in the petal and individual drops of water. I also appreciated the new wide color aperture capability in the camera, which faithfully recreated the darker and lime green leaves that surrounded the flower. However, the Galaxy S7 did a slightly better job of also keeping the pistil in focus.The reason to get the iPhone 7 Plus over the iPhone 7 isn't the bigger screen, but the second telephoto lens that gives you true optical zoom. In the live-camera view on the iPhone 7 Plus, you'll see a 2x button; press it, and you'll be able to get much closer to your subject without the typical digital zoom noise.A shot I took of the Empire State Building with and without the 2x zoom resulted in completely different photos. It's like cropping without the work, and the close-up looked more dramatic with the late-day sun bouncing off its facade, contrasting against the clear blue sky. You can zoom in even farther from there to 5x or 10x by sliding your thumb on the screen, but it will be digital.Soon, Apple will release a camera update for the Plus that will add a special Portrait mode for taking photos that leverage the dual-camera setup. You’ll be able to artfully blur the background for a dramatic ""bokeh"" effect.The reason to get the iPhone 7 Plus over the iPhone 7 isn't the bigger screen, but the second telephoto lens that gives you true optical zoom.Apple also graced both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with a sharper 7-megapixel front camera, an upgrade over the 5-MP camera in the previous iPhones. The camera did a fine job capturing my weekend stubble, as well as the folds on my gray O'Kelly’s Pub T-shirt. The flash accurately captured my skin tone without blowing out the background.When trying out the iPhone 7 for the first time, my wife was convinced that the Home button was a real button. ""The whole bottom of the phone feels like it's vibrating,"" she said. That's Apple's Taptic Engine in action, which provides feedback that makes the Home button feel like it's being depressed when it's not. Then I turned off the iPhone 7 and she tried pressing again. Nothing. My wife called it ""sorcery."" There's a learning curve, but I'm glad Apple made this move, because you'll no longer have to worry about lint or other gunk getting behind that button.Plus, because more than just the Home button vibrates, developers can tap into the Taptic Engine to make games and other apps feel more immersive, building on last year's 3D Touch experience. I got a taste of this capability when I played the Zombie Gun Ship shooting game and could feel each shot and explosion. Here's hoping developers give the Taptic Engine more love than 3D Touch got and update their apps.We'll get to the benchmark results, but what I appreciate most about the A10 Fusion chip in the iPhone 7 is how much more responsive it makes the iPhone 7 feel versus the iPhone 6. That nagging lag between opening an app and stuff appearing on screen, such as in the Settings menu, is practically gone. Exiting to the home screen is also faster, as is launching the camera, which takes a half second less. That may not seem like much. Over the course of a day, though, and certainly a couple of years, all of those momentary delays add up.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesApple says that the four-core A10 Fusion processor is the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone, and our test results back that up. On the new Geekbench 4 benchmark, the iPhone 7 notched 5,507, compared with 3,917 for the Galaxy S7. The OnePlus 3 and LG G5 also trailed Apple's flagship.Those who care about gaming will love the advantage the iPhone 7 has over the competition. The iPhone 7 turned in a score f 37,810 on the 3D Mark Ice Storm Unlimited Test. That demolishes the OnePlus 3 (29,957), Galaxy S7 Edge (27,851) and LG G5 (27,118).Last but not least, the iPhone 7 also beat the field on the JetStream browser test, which measures JavaScript performance. (Higher numbers are better.) The iPhone 7 hit 169.04 in Safari, compared with the low 50s for the LG G5 and OnePlus 3 and 44 for the Galaxy S7 — all in Chrome. When it comes to storage, I'm glad that Apple finally stopped ripping people off by starting with just 16GB. Now both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus offer your choice of 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of storage. Each tier adds $100 to the price tag.You'll have much less of a need to slap a bulky battery case on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. They benefit from bigger batteries than the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus (according to iFixit), and the A10 Fusion chip has two low-power cores that kick in when you don't need intense performance.The larger iPhone 7 Plus' battery endured for 1.5 hours half longer than the iPhone 7, lasting 10 hours and 35 minutes.On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involved continuous web surfing over AT&T 4G LTE network, the iPhone 7's 1960 mAh battery lasted 9 hours and 3 minutes. That's a huge improvement over last year's iPhone 6s 1715 mAh battery on the same network, which lasted just 6:46. The smartphone average is 8:54, and the Galaxy S7 lasted a slightly less 8:43.The larger iPhone 7 Plus' 2900 mah battery (up from 2750 mAh on the 6s Plus) endured for 1.5 hours longer than the iPhone 7, lasting 10 hour and 35 minutes. That's longer than the lowly 8:16 from last year's iPhone 6s Plus and it also beats the Galaxy S7 Edge (10:09). However, several Android phones last 11 hours or longer.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both support iOS 13, so you can enjoy features like Dark Mode and much-improved Photos app.Apple’s software makes the iPhone more visually appealing and more open than ever before. For example, the Messages apps lets you share GIFs in your texts, as well as fun visual effects like Fireworks. There’s also lots of new apps that integrate with Messages, including OpenTable for booking restaurant reservations and Square Cash for sending money directly from within the messaging app.Swiping to the left of the home screen brings up a Today screen that lets you quickly check the weather, news headlines, your next appointment and more. You can customize the order these widgets appear in and download more from the App Store as developers update their apps to take advantage of this iOS 10 feature.Another highlight is that Siri is now open to apps. For instance, you can ask Apple’s assistant to book you a car via Lyft or Uber or send messages to contacts via LinkedIn with your voice.Photos gets a welcome makeover in iOS 10, too, serving up curated Memories that consist of your best photos and videos over certain time periods. You can also search for images based on the People in them. And Photos now supports facial recognition, automatically grouping together photos featuring the same people.There’s a lot more to this update, including proactive suggestions in Maps and when you’re typing, so check out our full iOS 10 review.I would have liked to see Apple up the screen resolution on its flagship phones and shave away some of the screen bezel to make the Plus more one-hand friendly. But I really don't mind the missing headphone jack because I've already gone wireless. Between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, I'd go with the Plus. You get longer battery life, a bigger screen and a second telephoto lens that lets you get closer to your subjects."
129,Galaxy S8,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/galaxy-s8,review-4287.html","The Galaxy S8 has been around for a couple of years, but it's still a strong choice for those looking for flagship-level design and solid performance for under $500. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ boast 5.8- and 6.2-inch infinity displays, which go from edge to edge, and these handsets feature Qualcomm’s relatively zippy Snapdragon 835 processor for speedy performance.We’re still not fans of the fingerprint sensor’s location. But when you add in excellent battery life and improvements to a camera that was already very good, you have two winning handsets with the Galaxy S8 and S8+.Galaxy S8 price and release dateThe Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ were released in April of 2017. You can now get the Galaxy S8 starting at $499 with 64GB of storage. The larger Galaxy S8+ isn't as readily available, but it retails for about $589. However, we've seen this phone for as low as $364 on Amazon. You may want to keep an eye out for Black Friday deals and Cyber Monday deals to see if these phones get discounted during the holiday season.Design: It feels like the futureThe Galaxy S8 exemplifies a nearly bezel-free phone done right. Samsung didn’t just take away the bezels on this phone; it crafted a space-age work of art with a new infinity display that stretches from edge to edge. The Galaxy S8 not only has a slightly bigger screen-to-body ratio than LG’s phone but also looks sleeker because of the way the Gorilla Glass curves toward the edges on the front and back. Other Android phones look like blah, flat slabs by comparison. The S8 is also thinner and narrower than the G6.The screen on the S8 is 5.8 inches, versus 6.2 inches on the S8+. But other than the difference in display size, the S8 and S8+ have the same design. Overall, we prefer the bigger screen on the S8+, but if you have small hands, you’ll likely find yourself repositioning the phone in your hand to reach certain buttons, including the home button, which is now a virtual button instead of a physical key. The button worked well in our testing, providing solid haptic feedback. It’s flanked by the Recent Apps and Back buttons.What’s remarkable about the Galaxy S8 is how much more screen real estate it gives you compared with the S7, while still offering a compact and lightweight design. The S8’s 5.8-inch screen is housed in a 5.5-ounce, 2.7-inch-wide chassis, whereas the 5.1-inch S7 weighed 5.4 ounces and had the same width. The S8 is taller, but it’s still easy to use with one hand.With its 6.2-inch screen, the 6.1-ounce S8+ is heftier than the 5.5-ounce, 5.5-inch S7 Edge. But the S8+ makes the iPhone 8 Plus (6.2 x 3.1 x 0.29 inches, 7.13 ounces) look positively bloated. Plus, unlike the latest iPhones, the S8 and S8+ have headphone jacks.No matter which size you choose, it won’t be long before you see fingerprint smudges on the back of the phone. The smudges were especially prominent on the midnight black version of the S8 and S8+, but you can also choose the lighter orchid gray or arctic silver, which don’t show smudges as easily.About that fingerprint sensor…We were worried that the fingerprint sensor’s placement right next to the camera on the back of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ might be a problem. And it was, initially. Because the sensor is fairly narrow, it’s difficult to target it without looking. We got used to it after a couple of days, but we still wish it were below the lens.If you don’t want to reach around the S8 to unlock your phone, you can choose from a couple of other biometric options that Samsung gives you. There’s facial recognition, as well as iris scanning. Iris scanning unlocks your phone faster and even works in the dark, but it doesn’t work in direct sunlight; your eyes need to be fully open, so squinting isn’t an option. The facial recognition is not only slower but also had trouble in direct sunlight and doesn’t work in the dark.Our advice? Use the iris scanning everywhere except in the sun, and when there is bright light, just use the fingerprint scanner.Display: The perfect screen is hereApple is bringing an OLED screen to the iPhone X, but you have to pay a grand for the privilege. Sporting a resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels, both the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ turned in nearly perfect scores on our tests, offering a very bright picture, amazingly vivid colors and near-perfect color accuracy.The extra-wide 18.5:9 aspect ratio doesn’t work well with some apps, but overall, we like how immersive the experience is when watching video and playing games.When watching the new Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer, we could make out every wrinkle in Rey’s hands as she seemed to levitate the rocks around her with the Force, as well as every rising ring of smoke around Kylo Ren’s smoldering mask. As the camera panned around to the island where Luke was training Rey, it was hard not to be impressed by the golden sunshine that reflected off the water, as well as the lush, green foliage dotting the mountains.The S8 backed up our experience by reproducing a superb 183 percent of the sRGB color gamut. That blows away the LG G6’s 134 percent, but the AMOLED screen on the Google Pixel scored an even higher 191 percent. (However, when you turn on Adaptive Display mode on the Galaxy S8, it can reach as high as 255 percent.)If you’re looking for accurate color, the S8 can deliver that, too. In its AMOLED photo mode, the display notched a Delta-E score of 0.28 (0 is perfect). The LG G6 was closest, at 1.01, but the Pixel XL was way behind, with 5.88. Like the LG G6, the Galaxy S8’s screen is HDR certified, which means you can enjoy a wider range of colors and better contrast on videos that support the standard. Amazon, Netflix and YouTube offer a growing variety of HDR-ready movies and shows.The 18.5:9 aspect ratio doesn’t work well with every app. For instance, in Super Mario Run, we noticed unsightly bars above and below the game. But Samsung’s own apps are optimized, and you can fill the screen by pushing a button while watching YouTube and Netflix, even if the video looks a bit stretched out.Since our initial review, some users complained about a red tint appearing on their S8 screens, but Samsung has released a fix.Audio: Poppin’For a small speaker, the Galaxy S8 pumps out pretty sweet sound. When we listened to Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling,” on this phone, the lyrics were clearer, and the volume was louder, than the same track on the LG G6.The latter handset sounded slightly muffled by comparison. However, you don’t get stereo sound from the Galaxy S8 as you do from the HTC U Ultra.The S8's Snapdragon 835 muscle blitzes every other Android phone on the market.Performance: A handheld powerhouseThe Galaxy S8 goes boldly forward into a new era of speed, thanks to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 system on a chip (at least in the U.S.; in other regions, the S8 will have Samsung's Exynos 8895 chip). The S8 also comes with a healthy 4GB of memory, 64GB of storage (twice the amount you get from base models of the LG G6 and the Google Pixel) and microSD card expansion for people who need even more space.When you put it all together, the S8's muscle blitzes every other Android phone on the market, but it falls short of the iPhone 8's A11 Bionic chip. The S8 almost always feels exceedingly snappy, no matter if you're vaulting over Goombas in Super Mario Run or mowing down aliens in N.O.V.A. Legacy. We didn’t experience any lag when using multiwindow mode for chatting with friends while streaming video on YouTube. If you pay close attention, you may notice that some of the transitions when switching between apps aren't 100 percent smooth, but that seems mostly cosmetic.In terms of benchmark performance, the Galaxy S8’s multicore score of 6,295 in the Geekbench 4 overall performance test was more than 50 percent higher than that of its closest Android competitor, the Snapdragon 821-powered Google Pixel XL (4,146). However, the iPhone 8 scored above 10,000 on this test.The Galaxy S8's graphics power was also quite impressive, as it hit 36,508 on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test. Other Android adversaries, like the LG G6 (29,611) and the Google Pixel XL (28,182), were farther behind. But the iPhone 8 scored a much higher 64,532.New for the S8 is Samsung's Device Management tab, which is best accessed by swiping in from the Edge tab. It offers a quick look at the status of your device, including battery status, power mode (optimized, performance, game or entertainment), available storage and your current memory usage. There's even an optimization button that cleans up any lingering apps and clears your cache, which is a handy tool for people who go weeks or months without actually turning off their devices.Cameras: Better on both the front and backWhen we first found out that the S8's 12-megapixel rear camera is ostensibly the same as the one on last year's S7, we were a bit disappointed. But that rush of emotion was a bit premature, because under the hood, Samsung made some important software enhancements. And then you toss in a new, higher-resolution, 8-MP front cam, and you get a phone that produces noticeably better pictures no matter which shooter you're using.The most important tweak comes in the form of Samsung's new multi-image photo processing, which mimics the operation of the Google Pixel's HDR+ mode by taking multiple pictures when you press the shutter, selecting the best one, and enhancing that image with extra details and info from the remaining two pics.When we took both the S8+ and a Pixel XL out for some side-by-side testing, it was clear that Samsung's adjustments have had a pretty positive effect. At a nearby farmer's market, the S8 captured a crate full of apples with better contrast, richer colors and better details than the Pixel XL.And when I continued down the street, the S8+ topped the Pixel XL again when I snapped a pic of some flowers, this time offering better white balance than Google's phone, as evidenced by the greenish hue on the white flower's petals.But it wasn't a clean sweep for the S8+. When I really tried to push both cameras to the limit by shooting a backlit scene pointing straight at the sun, the Pixel XL stunned us with a shot featuring big, bold colors and sharp details, even though there was some serious lens flare going on.Inside, in pretty much ideal conditions, the S8+ and the Pixel XL were again neck and neck. The one difference is that the Pixel's cool color tone brought out the green in the pistachio macaroon, while the pic from the S8 sported a more neutral white balance, which led to a more pleasing overall photo.Finally, at a local bar with even less light to work with, both the Pixel XL and the Galaxy S8 impressed us with photos that were brighter than the scenes in real life. Small differences included less blown-out highlights in the S8's pic, which was countered by more detail in the darker areas of the scene in the Pixel's photo.When it comes to tweaking your photos or changing modes, Samsung has added new Snapchat-like filters that let you decorate faces with various animal masks, hats and other silly emojis. But if that doesn't strike your fancy, the camera also comes with modes for shooting panoramas, food, slow-mo and more. And as with all good camera apps, there's also a Pro mode that lets you adjust settings manually.As for selfies, the S8 and S8+ sport new 8-MP cams with a wide-angle lens, which makes it easy to snap you and all your besties at once. However, compared with the Pixel XL's 8-MP camera, the S8's selfies can sometimes be a little lacking.We compared photos shot by the S8 and the Pixel XL outside on a sunny day. The Pixel XL's photo had an extra level of sharpness and detail we didn't get from the S8+. Our face looked a little too smooth and perfect on the Samsung, to the point where we were wondering whether Beauty Mode was kicking in even when we had it set to 0.The Galaxy S8’s camera can shoot 4K video at 30 frames per second and slow-mo video at up to 240 frames per second at 720p. (In comparison, the LG G6 shoots at just 60 fps in slow-mo.)To test the Galaxy S8’s video quality, we shot some footage of a pond with fish swimming about in 4K. The S8’s footage looked crisper and more vibrant than what the iPhone 7 Plus captured, even if the colors looked a bit oversaturated. However, when we put both phones on a mount to test image stabilization, the iPhone 7’s video looked smoother; we saw a bit of stuttering in the S8’s footage as we walked up a grassy hill.For a hallmark feature on a flagship phone, Bixby feels pretty half-baked right now.Bixby: Still a work in progressThe Galaxy S8 introduces a new personal assistant, Bixby, to take on the likes of Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana. And for a hallmark feature on Samsung's flagship phone, Bixby feels pretty half-baked right now, even after Samsung has rolled out voice controls to its virtual assistant.The main difference between Bixby and other digital assistants is that it lets you use voice commands to control your phone in lieu of tapping the screen, which can save you time and energy. You can also use Bixby to tell you the weather or look up the definition of quixotic, but its real purpose is giving you a whole new way to control your phone. For instance, you can ask Bixby to show you emails from a specific person by name, and it will slickly pull up all your conversations in just a couple seconds. That's way faster than tapping to open the email app, hitting search and then typing in that person's name.  Bixby can also understand complex commands with contextual language, so you can do things like ask Bixby to post the last photo you took to Instagram and add a caption, all with one command. You can also change almost any setting on the S8 using your voice, which is often much faster than trying to dig through a modern phone's increasingly complex array of menus and tabs.Or at least, that's how things should work. The big problem is that Bixby's voice-command functionality, while now available, was pretty erratic when we tested it.Sometimes Bixby will fail to understand your language at all, while other times, Bixby will get confused and try to open the wrong app or adjust incorrect settings. But every once in a while Bixby will get everything right and you won't even be able to tell that its voice commands are still a work in progress. Currently, simple commands have the best success rate.MORE: 11 Coolest Things Bixby Voice Can Do on the Galaxy S8As of August 22, Samsung announced that the Bixby voice command feature is now available in more than 200 countries and territories, though you'll still need to use either English or Korean to make it work. Support for additional languages, as well as more third party apps, is in the works.Then there's Bixby Vision, which leverages the S8's camera along with object recognition to identify items in the world. We found this worked pretty well when we pointed the S8 at various household items, such as shampoos, snacks and aluminum foil. It also works for books. After pointing the Galaxy S8's camera at any object, we could check prices online on Amazon.Say you're at the liquor store and want to know the rating of that wine or what food to pair it with. Bixby has also partnered with Vivino to identify that bottle and spit back information. However, at a wine store in New York, the feature was more miss than hit, as it seemed to have trouble with the bright lights. At home, however, Bixby identified three wines correctly, though we were greeted with a home server error.Bixby's other talents include the ability to set reminders and a Bixby Home tool with a card-based interface that shows you your schedule, what's trending on Facebook, the weather, news and other info.All told, Bixby is a frustrating mix of success and failures, though there is a lot of potential should Samsung work out all the kinks. Thankfully, though, you can turn to the Google Assistant, which also comes preloaded on the S8.Software: Feature-rich but accessibleRunning Android 7.0 Nougat, the Galaxy S8 still has a skin on top of Android, but it’s fairly intuitive, and Samsung’s minimalist, line-drawn icons are easy to understand. We like that you don’t have to tap a button to see all of your apps from the home screen; just swipe down from the middle of the screen, and then swipe left to see more apps.If you swipe down from the very top of the screen from wherever you are, you’ll see your notifications and Samsung’s quick-settings shortcuts. Finally, swiping in from the left provides access to Edge screen shortcuts, such as a customizable list of apps, a device maintenance screen (for battery, choosing performance mode, etc.) and a Smart Select tool for selecting an area of the screen and sharing it or pinning it to the top of your display.You’ll also find a ton of advanced features. The ones at the top of our list include a one-handed mode that you can activate by tapping the home button three times to shrink the screen, as well as the ability to quickly launch the camera by pressing the power key twice.At least on the T-Mobile S8 we tested, there was minimal bloatware. T-Mobile included just five of its own apps: Device Unlock, T-Mobile, T-Mobile Name ID, T-Mobile TV and Visual Voicemail.Accessories: Way beyond Gear VRThe Galaxy S8 works with the new Gear VR for those who want to experience virtual-reality games and content, but that’s not the only interesting accessory. The new DeX ($149) is a dock that lets you use the S8 and S8+ as a mini PC. The dock can connect to a full-size monitor via its HDMI port, as well as a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth. It also has an Ethernet jack and a USB port.Out of the box, the Samsung Connect app will let you access and control various Samsung-branded smart home gear. For instance, you can start your Samsung robot vacuum ($549) or peek inside your Samsung Family Hub fridge (about $2,900) to see what you need from the store while you’re out. But you’ll get a lot more possibilities if you buy Samsung's $169 Samsung Connect Home — a combination mesh Wi-Fi router and SmartThings hub that will let you control other items, such as Philips Hue lights and Netgear’s Arlo security camera.Samsung offers a slew of other accessories, including an LED View cover for always having the time in view, a wireless charging stand and more. Check out our roundup of the Best Galaxy S8 accessories and Galaxy S8 cases.Battery LifeOne concern about a phone with this much screen is how that extra real estate might impact battery life. The Galaxy S8+ has a slightly smaller battery than last year’s S7 Edge (3,500 mAh versus 3,600 mAh), and yet the S8+ improved almost 1 hour, to 11 hours and 4 minutes, on the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing on 4G LTE using T-Mobile's network). The standard Galaxy S8’s 3,000-mAh battery endured for 10:39 on the same test, improving on the Galaxy S7's (8:47) time by nearly 2 hours.We obtained these results with the phones’ resolutions set to their max 2960 x 1440 pixels. They come with the less demanding 2220 x 1080 setting on by default.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeCompared to the Galaxy S8+, the Pixel XL's battery life was just a bit longer, at 11:11. The iPhone 8 Plus hit 11:16, while the smaller iPhone 8 lasted 9:54. LG G6 finished way behind, with a time of just 8:39.On top of that, the S8 has battery smarts that let it learn about your usage patterns to help extend its longevity even further. And when you need to juice the phone back up, you can take advantage of the S8’s fast-charging capabilities via its included USB Type-C cable or use one of Samsung's slick wireless chargers (available separately).Bottom LineIt’s clear that, with the Galaxy S8 and S8+, Samsung set out to create more than a phone. It’s trying to build a more Apple-like ecosystem, with devices ranging from the Gear VR and the DeX dock to the new Samsung Connect app for controlling smart home gear and the Bixby assistant. It’s also evident that Samsung hasn’t yet reached that goal, as Bixby’s voice features can be hit or miss.But even with that shortcoming, the Galaxy S8 still beats the Android competition while surpassing the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus in terms of design, display quality and features. The iPhones are better, though, when it comes to sheer speed and their cameras.Some shoppers will prefer a newer Android phone in the same price range, like the $479 Pixel 3a XL, but overall the Galaxy S8 and S8+ remain good values for those who prefer Samsung handsets.Credit: Jeremy Lips/Tom's Guide; Comparisons: Samuel Rutherford/Tom's Guide."
130,iPhone XS Max and iPhone XS,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/iphone-xs-max,review-5747.html","The iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max are Apple's flagships now and top our best phone list, but you can still get the older iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max at a discounted price. Of the two, I prefer the 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max ($999/£999), thanks to its ginormous screen and longer battery life.The 5.8-inch iPhone XS ($899/£899) has all the same enhancements as its supersize sibling, including a fast A12 Bionic processor that blows away most Android phones, as well as improved cameras with Smart HDR and impressive bokeh controls. To see how Apple's 2018 iPhones compare, check out our iPhone XS vs iPhone XS Max vs iPhone XR face-off.iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max Cheat SheetiPhone XS and iPhone XS price and dealsThe iPhone XS starts at $899/£899 for 64GB of storage. We'd prefer the 128GB you get with the Galaxy Note 9's base model. But you can upgrade to 256GB and 512GB on the iPhone XS for $1,049/£1,049 and $1,249/£1,249, respectively. The iPhone XS Max starts at $999/£999 for 64GB, and goes up to $1,149/£1,149 for 256GB and a whopping $1,349/£1,349 for 512GB. For our money, we would go for 256GB if possible. Opting for 512GB of storage will be overkill for most people when you factor in how much you can store in iCloud Storage.When you break down the phone's price to monthly payments (available in the US only), the cost varies by carrier, but figure about $42 a month for the iPhone XS and $46 for the iPhone XS Max. Be sure to check out our frequently updated best iPhone XS deals to make sure you get the best price. We're also tracking the best Black Friday deals and best Cyber Monday deals.Design: Regular and SupersizedAs someone who carried the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus for more than a year before moving on to the 5.8-inch iPhone X, the iPhone XS Max feels familiar in my hands and pocket. Note I didn't say that it feels great. That's because the iPhone XS Max is about the same size as the larger iPhone 7 Plus and  iPhone 8 Plus while packing in a larger 6.5-inch display.The good news is that you get more screen real estate in the same size chassis as Apple's Plus handsets, minus the bezels and Home button. The bad news is that this is definitely not a skinny-jeans phone (not that anyone should ever wear them), and that you'll need two hands to use this 7.3-ounce behemoth comfortably. By comparison, Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 is a lighter 7.1 ounces but it's also taller and a little bit thicker.The 5.8-inch iPhone XS is better optimized for one-handed use, as it's shorter and narrower than the iPhone XS Max while weighing a lighter 6.24 ounces.Whichever iPhone model you choose, it looks gorgeous in gold. I like the way the glass back plays with ambient light to deliver different shades, while the shiny color-matched stainless steel adds a hint of bling. Apple says this phone has the most durable glass ever on a smartphone, but we have not yet been able to test that claim. (The iPhone X finished third the last time we tested smartphone durability.)Early drop tests on the iPhone XS look promising, though. YouTuber TechSmartt dropped the handsets from pocket height, head height (6 feet) and while standing on a picnic table with arm extended, and Apple's phones can through without cracking.Extended warranty company SquareTrade gave the iPhone XS a high breakability score following its drop tests, but it started at an unrealistic height of 6 feet.Apple has upped the durability in another way, as the iPhone XS and XS Max are both IP68 rated for dust- and water-resistance. That means they can withstand being submerged in 2 meters of water for up to 30 minutes, compared with 1 meter of water for the same amount of time on the iP67-rated iPhone X and iPhone 8.Display: The Max Steals the ShowBigger and bolder than anything Apple has ever put in a phone, the iPhone XS Max's OLED display is a sight to behold. Not only is it ginormous at 6.5 inches, you can use split-view mode in various Apple apps, such as Mail and Calendar. The phone looks and feels more like a desktop. However, the Galaxy Note 9 can run two separate apps side by side, including third-party apps.When Danny Rand started running down the street with yellow and red neon lights toward a speeding truck, and then sheared off its front with a punch of his glowing Iron Fist, I felt like I was in Chinatown. I could make out all the creases in his yellow face mask, and the resulting sparks from the punch really popped.The Super Retina Displays on both of the new iPhones are searingly bright, with the iPhone XS' registering 611 nits on our light meter and the iPhone XS' Max hitting 606 nits. (The Galaxy Note 9's 6.4-inch screen reached 604 nits.) Their OLED panels are pretty colorful, too, covering 123 percent of the sRGB color gamut. The Note 9's screen, however, reaches 224 percent.The hues on the new iPhones' screens are more accurate, however, as they achieved a Delta-E rating of 0.25 and 0.22 for the XS and XS Max, respectively. A score of 0 is perfect. The Galaxy Note 9 fared slightly worse on this test with a Delta-E rating of 0.34.iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max SpecsCamera: Catching Up to (and Sometimes Beating) Pixel 2If there's one area where the Apple needed to improve the iPhone, it's the camera. Google's Pixel 2 beat the iPhone X in our face-off, especially in low light. The iPhone XS and XS Max even the score with dual 12-MP cameras that have bigger and deeper pixels that let in up to 50 percent more light without sacrificing sharpness.Examine this photo in a bar we shot on the iPhone XS, Pixel 2 XL and Galaxy Note 9. The Note 9's shot is the most vibrant, but the iPhone X delivers stunning detail when you zoom in, allowing us to read the text on the bottles. Plus, the upper-left area of the image didn't get blown out as it did on the other two phones.The iPhone XS also benefits from a new Smart HDR mode, which Apple says takes advantage of faster sensors, an enhanced ISP and advanced algorithms to offer more highlights and shadow details in photos. I saw the improvement in shots like this, where I could see more of the eagle in the iPhone XS that got lost in the original iPhone X's image.In this shot of colorful cupcakes, the iPhone XS once again delivers more detail, especially when you zoom in to see the frosting and the sugar crystals. The Note 9's shot is a close second because it's simply brighter and a bit more inviting.The iPhone XS now gives you Depth Control, so you can tweak the depth of field after you shoot. This worked extremely well when I captured this picture of my colleague Adam. Using a slider, I could adjust the blur effect so that I could see the trees and some passersby behind him or make it so that I could  see only hints of those objects.Does the iPhone XS beat the Pixel 2 XL at portraits with its two rear cameras? Not quite. In this shot of my colleague Caitlin, the iPhone XS' picture looks a bit too warm, while the exposure on the Pixel 2 XL looks more natural given the lighting conditions. Plus, you can make out more detail in her hair and her face looks brighter. The Note 9's shot looks great, but the left side of Caitlin's face looks blown out.The iPhone XS' camera is good at close-ups, too, but the Pixel 2 XL edged it out. While the iPhone captured a brighter photo of this yellow flower,  Google's camera let us see the specs in the leaves better, and the green leaves around it look more saturated.In one more low-light test, the iPhone XS took the brightest shot of this clock in Grand Central, and there's less noise on the signs in the background as you zoom in. But the gold resonates more on the clock in both the photos from the Pixel 2 XL and the Note 9.The 7-MP TrueDepth front camera on the iPhone XS and XS Max both benefit from the same advanced bokeh controls and Smart HDR. The Stage Light effect, which blacks out everything but your face, is still hit or miss. But I thought the Contour Lighting effect did its job without looking like too-heavy makeup.PerformanceThe A12 Bionic processor is the first 7-nanometer chip in a phone, but what's more important is what that enables. Apple claims that the two high-performance cores in this 6-core processor are up to 15 percent faster, and that the 4-core GPU is up to 50 percent faster.Before we even get to the benchmark scores, it's important to note that Face ID is faster on the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max than on the iPhone X. That's because of improved algorithms in iOS 12 and the speedier A12 chip. It's just a half-second difference or so, but it's noticeable, and I appreciate being able to unlock my phone faster than on last year's iPhone X.The iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max also shined in other real-world tasks, such as video editing. It took Apple's phones just 39 seconds to transcode a 2-minute 4K clip to 1080p. The Galaxy S9 took 2:32, and the OnePlus 6 finished in 3:45.How about opening apps? The iPhone XS took 20.8 seconds to open Fortnite, 4.9 seconds for Pokémon Go and 6.17 seconds for the Asphalt 9 racing game. The Note 9 was slower across the board at 35 seconds, 7.2 seconds and 9.1 seconds, respectively. The older iPhone X was also slower than the iPhone XS at 26, 7.2 and 10 seconds for the above apps.MORE: The Best Smartphones Available Right NowOn Geekbench 4, which measures overall speed, the iPhone XS Max scored 11,515, while the iPhone XS hit a slightly lower 11,420. Those scores smoke the fastest Android phones around, including the Snapdragon 845-powered Galaxy Note 9 (8,876) and the OnePlus 6 with 8GB of RAM (9,088).To test graphics performance, we ran 3DMark Slingshot Extreme, and the iPhone XS Max scored 4,339 and the iPhone XS hit 4,244. Both of those numbers are below the Galaxy Note 9's 4,639, but they're a lot higher than the 2,227 turned in by the older iPhone X.In a separate graphics benchmark that has a more intense workload, GFX Bench 5, the iPhone XS Max crushed the the Galaxy Note 9. Apple's phone scored higher Aztec Ruins test (1,604.7 frames to 851.7 frames) and on the Car Chase test (1,744.44 frames to 1,103 frames).Neural Engine and ARThe next-generation Neural Engine inside the A12 Bionic on the iPhone XS is now up to nine times faster than what the A11 offered, which can give a sizable boost in augmented-reality apps. For instance, in the new elemenTao puzzle game, the iPhone XS Max was faster to load the experience than on the iPhone X, and it was able to scan for and place the virtual world on a table more quickly.From there, I could zoom in on a landscape, complete with clouds, mountains and water, and use the wind and even bolts of lightning to move a ball toward its goal. I also had a blast playing Smash Tanks, which allowed me to fling tanks around slingshot-style. The graphics rendered smoothly even when there were big explosions.I was also completely engrossed in the game when I tried shopping on the Magnolia Market website and pulled up a leather bag I could place right in front of me. I could make it bigger or smaller with pinch-to-zoom, and get up real close to see the stitching and zipper. Apple's usdz file format makes this a reality.I still think AR apps could be more compelling, though more are on the way using Apple's ARKit 2.0. For instance, the HomeCourt app leverages your iPhone's camera to show you how many basketball shots you make and miss during a given session, and a multiplayer Galaga game from Directive Games that lets you and some friends shoot alien spaceships in the same room at the same time. It makes Head's Up feel like Rock, Paper, Scissors.Audio: Sweeter StereoThe audio boost in the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max is so good that you'll think twice about connecting to a Bluetooth speaker. Apple says it widened the stereo sound to deliver more detail, and I immediately appreciated the difference when I put the iPhone X and the iPhone XS side by side.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeWhen listening to Imagine Dragon's ""What It Takes,"" Dan Reynolds' vocals sounded much more present on the iPhone XS . On the iPhone X, his voice seemed to recede into the background. The drums had more punch on the new phones, too.Battery Life and ChargingBased on a teardown of the iPhone XS and XS Max, the iPhone XS packs a 2,658 mAh battery, which is smaller than the 2,716 battery in the iPhone X. The iPhone XS Max has a larger capacity of 3,174 mAh, based on regulatory filings.The iPhone XS Max the phone to get if you want longer endurance. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over LTE on 150 nits of screen brightness, the iPhone XS Max lasted a good 10 hours and 38 minutes. That's above the category average but below the Galaxy Note 9's time of 11:16. The Pixel 2 XL lasted an even longer 12:09.The iPhone XS turned in a just-OK runtime of 9 hours and 41 minutes. That's shorter than the iPhone X's endurance, with that phone lasting 10 hours, 49 minutes when we tested it last year. When we retested the original iPhone X recently as part of our battery testing for the new phones, that time fell to 9 hours, 51 minutes, which could be because the websites we use in our browsing test are using more Javascript and other code than before, putting stress on the phone's bqttery.While the iPhone XS supports faster wireless charging, Apple still doesn't include what you need for fast wired charging in the box, even though every other Android phone maker does with its flagships.So, if you want to charge your iPhone XS or iPhone XS to 50 percent in 30 minutes, you'll have to invest in a USB-C power brick ($49) and USB-C-to-Lightning cable ($20). Apple should have made the switch to native USB-C with these iPhones or at the very least include an accessory.Some iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max owners are reporting a bug where the phones will not charge when the devices are plugged in and the screen is off. However, a fix should be coming with the iOS 12.1 update.iOS 12: New features added, including Apple News+, Apple Arcade and Apple TV+iOS 12 has a lot of enhancements under the hood, but the one I appreciate most is Instant Tuning, which is, essentially, easier control over notifications. If you keep getting alerts from an app that you find annoying, you can disable them right from the Notification screen.If you're into Animoji or Memoji, you can have lots of fun with your avatar on the new phones. The iPhone XS and XS Max can map 50 facial movements with its TrueDepth camera, and you can insert yourself in outgoing messages. You'll also be able to use Animoji and Memoji during FaceTime chats, but a promised group-calling feature  with up to 32 people isn't coming until later.Other iOS 12 highlights include Screen Time for keeping better tabs on your app usage, smarter search in photos and the ability to schedule Do Not Disturb mode.But I'm most excited by Siri Shortcuts, an app that will let you accomplish multiple tasks (including those using third-party apps) with a single phrase. For instance, saying ""I’m going home"" could turn on your Nest thermostat, text ""I’m coming home"" to a loved one and open up the Maps app to provide directions.iOS 12.1 brings several new features. These includes Group FaceTime, which allows you to conduct video calls with up to 32 people. And there's now Depth Control in real-time preview, which lets you adjust the bokeh effect in portraits as you're shooting.Dual SIM support is a welcome upgrade for travelers, professionals or anyone who wants to use two phone numbers on the same iPhone. And there are 70 new emoji in iOS 12.With iOS 12.2, the iPhone XS and XS offer access to the new Apple News+, which lets you subscribe to more than 300 magazines and The Wall Street Journal for $9.99 per month.Other services coming soon include Arcade Plus for enjoying 100+ premium games per month for $9.99, Apple Channels (think Amazon Channels for iOS) and the premium Apple TV+ service this fall.Gigabit LTE and Dual-SIMThe iPhone XS and XS Max now support Gigabit-class LTE, thanks to a new enclosure that has additional antennas that enable what's called 4x4 MIMO. The result was blazing speeds on T-Mobile's network using the Speedtest.net app. Downloads reached as high as 103 Mbps on the iPhone XS and 96.9 Mbps on the iPhone XS Max. The iPhone XS Max averaged 58.2 down, and the iPhone XS averaged a faster 67.2 Mbps.Uploads on the iPhone XS averaged 18.6 Mbps;  the iPhone XS Max pulled ahead here with 25.4 Mbps. By comparison, the older iPhone X averaged just 15.5 Mbps down and under 6 Mbps uploads.Third-party testing by SpeedSmart.net found similar LTE results, with the iPhone XS offering nearly double the download rates on some networks.In side-by-side tests against the Galaxy Note 9, the iPhone XS Max delivered slower download speeds but slightly faster uploads. We ran Speedtest.net multiple times in three different locations in New York City, and the iPhone averaged 45 Mbps downloads and 21.8 Mbps uploads, compared to 53.8 Mbps down and 18.6 Mbps up for the Galaxy.iPhone XS and XS Max vs iPhone XRI know what you're thinking. Why spend $999 on the iPhone XS or $1,100 on the iPhone XS Max when you can get the 6.1-inch iPhone XR for just $750? There's a very good case to be made for this more affordable option.The iPhone XR offers many of the same top features as the iPhone XS and XS Max, including the same powerful A12 Bionic processor, great camera quality (including portraits) and Face ID. Plus, the iPhone XR lasted longer on our battery life test at 11 hours and 26 minutes, compared to 10:38 and 9:41 for the iPhone XS Max and XS.Apple offers the iPhone XR in six colors, while the iPhone XS comes in three finishes.On the other hand, the XR's LCD screen doesn't offer the same black levels or wide viewing angles as the OLED panels on the iPhone XS or XS Max. You also don't get two rear cameras on the iPhone XR for 2x optical zoom.Bottom LineThe iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are among the best phones you can buy, and if you've been holding off on upgrading your iPhone 7 or iPhone 6s, either one of these handsets will feel like a huge leap forward. The cameras are miles better — especially in low light — and the A12 chip provides a big speed boost.Between the two, I'd opt for the iPhone XS Max because of its bigger and more immersive 6.5-inch display and longer battery life, but the iPhone XS is the new iPhone to get if you want something more one-hand friendly.If you're deciding between iOS and Android, the $999/£899 Galaxy Note 9 is an excellent alternative to the iPhone XS Max, offering an even more colorful display, double the storage and the handy S-Pen. The Google Pixel 3 XL is the ideal choice if you want an even better camera than the iPhone XS along with a big display.For those sticking with the iPhone, many will prefer the cheaper iPhone XR, which offers nearly all of the great features in the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max for $749/£749. But if you want a superior OLED display, dual rear cameras and less bezel, I'd splurge on the iPhone XS Max for it's even bigger screen.Credit: Tom's Guide"
131,Motorola One Action Hands-On,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/motorola-one-action-hands-on-this-budget-phones-all-about-video,"While many phone makers are working to bring flagship-quality photography to lower-priced handsets, few have extended the same focus to video. And that’s quite odd when you think about it, because these days, we capture video with our phones as often — if not more so — than we do still photos.Motorola hopes to address that oversight with its latest midrange handset. Called the Motorola One Action, the new device has a triple-lens system at the rear that’s been optimized for video, as well as an extra-wide 6.3-inch display roomy enough to fit the entirety of the content you capture.The Motorola One Action is available now for $349 unlocked from Best Buy and Motorola's website. Amazon offers a custom version with Alexa push-to-talk support built in, currently on sale for $289, while B&H is offering the device for a limited-time discount of $299.Priced competitively against budget champions like Motorola’s own G7 Power, the Nokia 7.1, Pixel 3a and Samsung Galaxy A50, the One Action could carve out a video-centric niche for itself. Here are our first impressions ahead of our full review coming soon.The Motorola One Action isn’t the first (relatively) cheap phone with a trio of cameras on the back; the recently-launched Galaxy A50 again springs to mind. That said, I can’t recall another device that’s used triple shooters quite the way Motorola’s does.The main camera, backed by a 12-megapixel sensor and ƒ/1.8 aperture lens, is boosted by a 5-MP depth sensor for shallow depth-of-field photography. But the third lens, rated at 16 MP, is used exclusively for video. What’s more, it has an ultrawide, 117-degree field of view, and utilizes pixel binning to better expose low-light recordings.Dubbed the Action Camera, Motorola envisions this lens being well-suited for capturing and sharing your surroundings. Zoom out of the standard, 78-degree perspective, and the feed within camera app will automatically shift to that wider vantage point, allowing you to include more in the frame. Pricier phones with dedicated ultrawide lenses already do this, though it’s nice to see this sort of functionality arrive in a more accessible device.Still, I’m concerned whether third party apps will actually be able to utilize the full scope of the Action Camera. On the Pixel 3, for example, pinching to zoom out when taking a selfie (or selfie video) in Snapchat doesn’t switch to that phone’s secondary, wider-angle lens the same way it does in Google’s own camera app.This isn’t Motorola’s fault — rather, it’s a limitation of Android that app developers haven’t been able to take advantage of the myriad hardware and software enhancements phone makers bake into their imaging stacks. Google is developing a tool called CameraX that’s designed to bridge that gap. However, until CameraX is widely adopted, companies like Motorola that aspire to have customers use their phones' cameras in new and interesting ways will continue to meet resistance from apps like Instagram and Snapchat, that have little incentive to keep pace.That would be a shame, too, since Motorola is doing some innovative and useful things on the video capture front. A small, yet critical new feature is the ability to record landscape, 21:9 video on the Motorola One Action even when holding the device in a portrait orientation. In these instances, the camera software simply rotates what it’s capturing by 90 degrees. It’s a brilliant little trick, because holding your phone right-side-up makes for significantly easier for one-handed operation.Camera aside, the Motorola One Action feature other noteworthy touches. The large 6.3-inch, 21:9 LCD display extends all the way to the top edge of the glass, and incorporates a front-facing camera within the screen, much like Samsung’s Galaxy S10e and its Infinity-O display. Unfortunately, the bezel around the camera lens is quite thick, which in turn makes the status bar pretty large — so it’s not quite as seamless an integration as you may have seen on pricier handsets.The Motorola One Action is crafted from polycarbonate all around, though the plastic does a decent job masquerading as glass when you hold the device in your hand. There’s a fingerprint sensor on the back, and the phone will be offered in three colors: Denim Blue, Pearl White and — outside of North America only — Aqua Teal.Inside the phone beats not one of Qualcomm’s chipsets, but a Samsung-sourced Exynos 9609 CPU. This silicon is comparable in power to the Exynos 9610 in the recently-released Galaxy A50, and likely just shy of the Pixel 3a’s Snapdragon 670 in terms of raw grunt. That chip is mated to 4GB of RAM, and Motorola has generously included a whopping 128GB of storage onboard. The latter can be expanded by up to another 512GB with the use of a microSD card.While the Motorola One Action ships with Android 9 Pie, Motorola has decided to forgo Android One software for the North American configuration. (The device Motorola supplied us to photograph was a European model, which is why it has an Android One logo on the back.) For this reason, the phone will only see one major software update during its lifespan, to Android 10, likely sometime in 2020. It also probably won’t receive security updates on the same monthly basis as Android One devices do.While Motorola made it clear to us that the shift away from Android One in this instance doesn’t mean the company will never build another Android One device again, it is nevertheless disappointing. Motorola’s typical Android front end is already borderline identical to stock Android, so the user experience is unlikely to suffer much there. However, the loss of long-term support is concerning.In fact, you could argue that the North American variants of the One Action will have shorter lifespans than their counterparts overseas, as a consequence of the lack of updates. It also doesn’t help that Motorola couldn’t provide us with a convincing reason for turning away from Android One, simply stating that the company ""decided to test how [the phone] performs without Android One and re-invest taking into consideration [its] consumer’s needs.""While it’s nice to see Motorola build out its budget range in a new direction with the Motorola One line, there are a few peculiarities with the One Action that give us pause.We like the dedicated ultrawide video camera and how the phone's design evokes that of pricier handsets. We also like the specs, which look to be in line with other midrange offerings. Yet Motorola distancing itself from Android One could be detrimental to its users, and we’re interested in seeing how the Action Camera plays with third-party Android camera apps.At $349, the Motorola One Action is hitting that sweet spot among budget phones right now. If you're looking to save big on your next handset, it should be on your radar. Stay tuned for our full review soon."
132,LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen Hands-on,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-smartphone-hands-on-review,"Updated, Oct. 21: LG has announced U.S. pricing and availability for the LG G8X ThinQ.Folding smartphone displays are theoretically a cool feature. But as the Samsung Galaxy Fold has demonstrated, it's a risky gambit. LG has a different approach to the dual screen craze, opting for a detachable solution.Confused? Then allow me to introduce the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen smartphone, a dual screen smartphone with a removable display. I had the opportunity to go hands on with this modular beauty during the IFA trade show in September, and while I'm not totally convinced in the phone's viability, I want at least a week to explore everything the G8x has to offer.LG says the G8X ThinQ Dual Screen hits the U.S. on Nov. 1, with prices starting at $699. (Pricing looks like it's going to vary from retailer to retailer.) You can pre-order the phone starting Oct. 25.Right now, AT&T, Sprint and Amazon are going to offer the LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen.The G8X has a lot of moving parts. First, you've got the actual smartphone. The Aurora Black rear panel houses a pair of cameras while the front of the phone is practically all display. In fact, outside of the small teardrop cutout for the front camera, the front is all screen. You’ll find volume and digital assistant buttons on the right side of the phone and the power on the left. Along the bottom, sits the USB Type-C port and a headphone jack.By itself, the G8X ThinQ weighs 6.8 ounces and measures 6.3 x 3.1 x 0.3 inches. It’s definitely in the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus (6.9 ounces, 6.4 x 3.0 x 0.3 inches) and Apple iPhone XS Max (7.3 ounces, 6.2 x 3.1 x 0.3 inches) weight class. The ThinQ also offers durability, as the phone is IP68 rated (water and dust resistant) and MIL-SPEC tested.  But there's still the second display to consider. The extraneous screen is housed in a wraparound smartphone cover, hence the name Cover Display. The second display is nestled in the left side of the cover with a phone-shaped space on the right side. There's even a cutout for the rear camera. The front of the Smart Cover is highly reflective. But if you can get past the glare, you might notice the 2 x 1-inch Notification Square that displays the time and any recent notifications without opening the Dual Screen.  With the cover attached, the Dual Screen weighs 11.5 ounces and 6.5 x 3.3 x 0.6 inches. It’s definitely substantial, but not so much I wouldn’t lug it around in my pocket.The Cover display has a 360-degree hinge called the Freestop hinge. It allows you to maneuver the Cover Display into a number of useful positions. The hinge makes the overall frame thicker, but LG stuck with it instead of a 180-degree hinge to give consumers more versatility. Along the center of the hinge, you’ll find buttons for volume and power. This is actually LG's second take on a dual-screen smartphone. Earlier this year, LG showed off an add-on for the LG V50 ThinQ called the Dual Display (an add-on that never made it to the U.S., it should be said). In that instance, you'd clip the second display onto the V50 using pogo pins, but LG says it refined the processor after listening to users. The result is now a second screen that attaches through USB-C. That makes linking the Dual Cover up with the G8X a bit like assembling a low-level Voltron. You simply slide the phone from the top down into the awaiting space. When positioned correctly, the phone connects to a USB Type-C input at the bottom of the cover and snaps into place. Need to ditch the Cover display for awhile, just put a little pressure on the rear panel to dislodge the phone and pull it out. During the G8X's unveiling, LG's presenter made a very good point about the Dual Screen. You don’t have to take the second display with you every time you step out of the house. If you want to travel light, just leave the cover display and go about your business and when you’re ready for some extra screen, just pop the ThinQ in and have at it. With the G8X ThinQ Dual Screen, you get not one but two 6.4-inch, 2340 x 1080 OLED displays. The displays are identical ,so hopefully as you use the phone and it ages, the screens will age at the same rate to keep the viewing experience consistent. As it stands, both displays are absolutely gorgeous and just bursting with color. I can’t wait to get them under our colorimeter to discover the gamut and color accuracy. But whether I was playing Asphalt, catching up on our latest IFA coverage or taking a quick selfie, the panels were mesmerizing. The twin displays are more fraternal than identical. The ThinQ’s panel has an in-display fingerprint reader while its sibling does not. The G8X is more than a pair of beautiful displays (though they are beautiful). Running on Android 9.0 (Pie) the ThinQ is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 CPU with 6GB of RAM with 128GB of onboard storage. Still need more room? You can expand it to a whopping 2TB via the microSD card slot. From the Asus ZenBook Pro Duo and the HP Omen 2XS, I’ve been inundated with double-paneled gadgets of late. And while the concept seems outlandish, especially with the G8X, I’m really a fan of the multitasking. When I used LG's phone to browse on Amazon for a pair of shoes, I tapped the buy button only to have a new page pop up on the Cover Display so I could make the purchase on one side and continue browsing on the other.In a bit of navel gazing, I pulled up Tom’s Guide on one screen and Laptop Mag on the other. And gamer that I am, I launched Asphalt on the main screen and the LG Game Pad in the other. Game Pad gives gamers the ability to create their own custom controls for each title, mapping the moves to the specific location on the main screen to the controls on the bottom. The result is in unobstructed view of top screen with simple to use controls When both screens are activated, a small menu appears along the side of the main display. Expanding the menu reveals several dual screen options depending on the apps currently open. My favorite is Extended View which transformed the two screens become one massive one, complete with continuous scroll.I only wish LG thought to throw a stylus into the mix and add some pen functionality. With that second display, my note taking could be a lot more efficient.Two screens are definitely better than one when it comes to snapping selfies and taking pictures and video in general. The G8X is outfitted with a formidable 32-megapixel front-facing shooter that, when paired with the two screens, helped me take some quality selfies. The room I was in was fairly dark so I used Reflector mode which allowed me to adjust the lighting for a better outcome. But make no mistake: the G8X's rear-mounted 12MP standard shooter and 13MP ultra-wide camera are no slouches either. LG included features like 4K Time Lapse and Steady Cam to makes sure you get some quality shots. And this is the first time, you’ll have the ability to switch between the front and back camera while recording video on an LG phone. The G8X has a 4,000mAH battery, which is a bit on the small side considering its working for two. Although LG claims the Cover Display only consumes 20% to 30% more charge when it's enabled, that still means faster battery drain. Because the phone is Quick Charge 4.0 capable, it shouldn't take long to recharge. Still, I’m curious to see how the phone will hold up to our battery test. Dual screens are the flavor of the month, but it’s up to companies like LG to make sure they outlast the initial fad. As it stands, I think this phone has a pretty good shot.The LG G8X ThinQ Dual Screen smartphone combines power, functionality and a little creativity for an impressive device, at least for the limited amount of time I had with it. Multitasking feels natural, and the screens are simply beautiful. And you have the option of rocking a relatively normal-sized phone when you want to travel light. I’m hoping that LG works out something with its wireless carrier partners, where you won't have to pay an arm, a leg and a baby to get your hands on the G8X, which would help make this outlandish concept feasible.

133,ZTE Axon 10 Pro,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/zte-axon-10-pro,"The Axon 10 Pro has been a long time coming. Last time we reviewed a high-end smartphone from ZTE, it was the ambitious, dual-screen Axon M back in 2017.We weren't particularly big fans of the Axon M's buggy software and negligible productivity, though that would soon prove to be the least of the Chinese phone maker's problems. Less than a year later, the company was forced to halt all operations to comply with a U.S. government ban on ZTE's dealings with U.S. suppliers.That ban dissolved just as quickly as it arrived, though, and ZTE soon after turned things around with the Axon 9 Pro late last year. But that phone missed some regions, including the U.S., which brings us to the Axon 10 Pro.All that corporate turmoil might have diminished your expectations for ZTE's latest handset. However, the Axon 10 Pro is a pleasant surprise, not only a respectable comeback for the once-embattled phone maker, but also one of the finest inexpensive flagships available today. That's true even if some drawbacks keep it from toppling the OnePlus 7T as our best unlocked value.The ZTE Axon 10 Pro starts at $549 for a model with 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage. Increasing the RAM to 12GB raises the price to $599.That makes the Axon 10 Pro attractively priced, especially considering the kinds of features you get with the phone. But you'll have to hunt down ZTE's device if you're interested in it. It's not sold through any wireless carrier in the U.S., so you'll have to have to buy the phone unlocked either through ZTE or from a retailer like Newegg or B&H.Stellar performance and specs for the priceIt's hard to discuss the Axon 10 Pro without talking numbers. This is a device powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 855 chipset, the very same silicon that drives the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus and OnePlus 7 Pro. The Axon 10 Pro also comes with 256GB of built-in storage and either 8GB or 12GB of RAM.The Axon 10 Pro is close to the best deal there is in high-performance Android phones.The big difference? Those phones start at $1,099 and $669, respectively, but the Axon 10 Pro costs anywhere from $120 to $550 less than that.Right now, that's as close to the best deal there is in high-performance Android phones. The Asus ZenFone 6 is cheaper, at $499, but features 6GB of RAM and an LCD display in lieu of the Axon 10 Pro's more vivid AMOLED panel. The OnePlus 7T packs a slightly more powerful Snapdragon 855 Plus processor and a faster refresh rate, with its 90-Hz screen, but it makes do with half the storage and 8GB of RAM, all for $599.ZTE is giving you a lot for a little here. And those specs don't just look nice on paper; they portend excellent all-around performance. The Axon 10 Pro is thoroughly snappy and handles demanding games, like PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9: Legends, just as well as any other 855-toting handset I've used. With a Geekbench 5 multicore score of 2,666 for our review unit with 8GB of RAM, ZTE's device comes within a hair of the OnePlus 7T's 2,759 result. That's pretty impressive, considering the 7T has that newer 855 Plus chip.MORE: Best Phones of 2019Those with copious quantities of media, apps and games will appreciate that you can expand the existing 256GB of built-in storage by up to another 2TB with the use of a microSD card.A satisfying screenOLED displays are no longer exclusively the domain of the priciest phones. That said, I'm still delighted and surprised by the 6.47-inch, 2340 x 1080 AMOLED panel inside the Axon 10 Pro.No, it's not quite as nice as the Fluid AMOLED screen inside the OnePlus 7T, which benefits from a 90-Hz refresh rate. That capability produces noticeably smoother animations compared to traditional, 60-Hz panels, like the one ZTE uses here. But the Axon 10 Pro's screen is still a pleasure to view.Watching Netflix's Formula 1: Drive to Survive on both the Axon 10 Pro and OnePlus 7T, it's difficult to suss out any differences; both look great. OnePlus' handset may exhibit slightly more-saturated colors to my eye, though the discrepancy is negligible. The yellow nose of the Red Bull chassis shone brightly under the Monaco sun on both OLED displays.The 4,000-mAh battery inside the Axon 10 Pro is among the largest you'll find for the price; only the 5,000-mAh ZenFone 6 eclipses the Axon.ZTE doesn't offer the user a plethora of color profiles to choose from, as OnePlus and Samsung do on their phones, so you're quite limited if you want to tweak the look of on-screen content to your preference. However, one option, called Display Optimization, boosts saturation and contrast across the entire system and all media when activated. Ultimately, I preferred to ignore Display Optimization, which is turned off by default. The effect is a little unrealistic, though it's there for those looking for a bit more pop.The Axon 10 Pro compares very favorably with the OnePlus 7T in terms of color accuracy and coverage. The ZTE device's Delta-E score of 0.31 is close enough that you can't really tell it apart from the OnePlus 7T's superior 0.27 result (numbers closer to zero are more accurate), while the Axon 10 Pro's 164.3% take of the sRGB color space is a bit bolder than OnePlus' 155.1%. Again, though, you'll be hard-pressed to tell them apart.MORE: Smartphone Buying Guide: 9 Tips for Finding the Right PhoneIn fact, the only disappointing aspect of the Axon 10 Pro's display is its low peak full-screen brightness of 430 nits. That's far below the 7T's 474 nits and worlds away from the LCD-powered iPhone 11's 652 nits. While having the brightest display in the world isn't a necessity, a panel that is too dim can be difficult to see outdoors on a sunny day. And the Axon 10 Pro is right on that edge of being frustrating to use in such conditions.A long-lasting, wirelessly charging batteryThe 4,000-mAh battery inside the Axon 10 Pro is among the largest available in a phone at this price. Only the ZenFone 6 eclipses it, with a gargantuan 5,000-mAh unit.Still, 4,000 mAh is a lot of power, certainly enough to keep the Axon 10 Pro chugging along when lesser handsets would call it quits. The device put in a respectable 10 hours and 14 minutes in Tom's Guide's custom battery test, which involves endlessly cycling through web pages using T-Mobile's LTE network.That time is demonstrably longer than the 3,800-mAh OnePlus 7T lasted (8:47), but well short of the ZenFone 6's remarkable 15-hour endurance. You might expect that, given the size of the battery Asus stuffed into the ZenFone 6.MORE: Best Phone Battery Life - Longest Lasting Smartphone BatteriesThe Axon 10 Pro uses Qualcomm's QuickCharge 4+ protocol for 18W fast charging, which is similar to the USB Power Delivery spec that the iPhone 11 Pro and Google Pixel 3 employ. ZTE's phone also supports wireless charging, which is a rarity at this price; none of OnePlus' phones, nor Asus' ZenFone 6, can interface with Qi induction pads.Derivative, uninspired designThe Axon 10 Pro is by no means an offensive or poorly designed smartphone; it's just not a very remarkable one to hold or look at.In fact, in many ways, it feels like ZTE is making up for lost time with this device. The curved, matte-aluminum edge and steeply sloping Gorilla Glass enclosure evoke Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S9, though the bezels are considerably slimmer above and below the display on the Axon 10 Pro. There is a notch on ZTE's phone as well, though it's that harsh, U-shaped kind that juts unnaturally into the top of the panel.If there's nothing particularly distinctive about the front of the Axon 10 Pro, good luck highlighting anything unique about the back either. You've got a trio of cameras stacked vertically in the upper left corner, with two housed in a raised enclosure and the last one flush with the phone, next to the flash.ZTE has pulled so many design motifs from rival phones that the Axon 10 Pro resembles a nameless pastiche of every handset we've given a passing glance this year.The phone's glass back has a mirrored finish, which looks sort of nice but also cheap; if you told me it was plastic, I'd believe you. For what it's worth, ZTE and Axon branding sit below the lenses on the left edge, similar to Huawei's markings on its P20 smartphone. It doesn't look great, but at least it allows you to tell the Axon 10 Pro apart from the competition.ZTE has pulled so many design motifs from rival phones that the Axon 10 Pro resembles a nameless pastiche of every handset we've given a passing glance this year. At least this device still manages to be light in the hand, as this Axon weighs about half an ounce less than the OnePlus 7T. ZTE's phone also carries a more agreeable footprint that's a bit tighter in every dimension. It doesn't feel as unwieldy during one-handed operation as OnePlus' products often do. The in-display optical fingerprint sensor works well enough and saves you from blindly searching for a scanner on the back of the device.The camera is subparOn paper, there's no reason to think the triple-lens camera on the back of the Axon 10 Pro would be worse than any other phone's shooter. The Axon 10 Pro features a 48-megapixel primary sensor tied to an ƒ/1.7 wide-angle lens, coupled with 8-MP, ƒ/2.4 telephoto and 20-MP, ƒ/2.2 ultrawide shooters.There's an optional AI Camera mode available, similar to Samsung's Scene Optimizer, which tunes exposure parameters based on what the lenses are pointed at. Interestingly, this software isn't activated out of the box; you have to go into the camera settings and enable it yourself. We turned the feature on for the following photos, though the object recognition was hit or miss and came into play only for the first image in this series. The Axon 10 Pro impressed initially with a satisfying shot of a yellow flower. It's a complex scene; you have a mix of natural light falling into the room from an adjacent window and colored, indoor light shining from above. To make things even more challenging, the camera is positioned against the main light source. However, ZTE's hardware and software navigate the visual landscape well, exposing the petals sharply, without oversaturating the yellow like the OnePlus 7T did. Even the flower's red spots are more individually discernible on the Axon 10 Pro. That said, I much prefer the slight grain to the 7T's bokeh, and OnePlus' phone is demonstrably more skilled at reining in the highlights outside.Here, we used optical zoom with both phones, 3x in the case of the Axon 10 Pro and 2x for the OnePlus 7T. You could certainly make the argument that 3x power is more useful than 2x when you really need optical zoom, but it's hard to ignore that the 7T's showing is plainly superior here. It's harder to keep still the more you zoom in, but ZTE hasn't done enough to stabilize images captured with the telephoto, as you can see by the slight blurriness of the succulent. Additionally, the mix of colored lights overhead creates a beautiful gradient against the leaf of the plant in the background of the OnePlus 7T's shot, something that's totally absent in the Axon 10 Pro's more muted result.On that note, ZTE's cameras have an odd habit of desaturating colors, and not in a way that looks pleasing or more realistic. You'll have to take my word for it that the light striking the mask and white wall in this photo should be more red than pink, as it is in the 7T's photo. Additionally, the Axon 10 Pro over-smoothed textures, especially if you pay close attention to the streaks of paint around the mask's nose.But by far the Axon 10 Pro's worst showing came when I attempted to take some portraits of my colleague Shaun. I'll concede that OnePlus' software took some liberties with Shaun's skin tone, making it a tinge warmer and redder than it truly is. But even with those minor inaccuracies, it's still light years closer to the ideal than the Axon 10 Pro's bleached-out, shaky attempt. The ZTE portrait fails on every level. There's less detail, especially in his tattoos; the highlights are completely blown out; the contrast is all wrong and even the bokeh is inconsistent and looks like it was shoddily approximated in Photoshop, after the fact.Still, I wouldn't say that the Axon 10 Pro's cameras are awful; for the price, they're as decent as you'd expect. The problem for ZTE is the competition. OnePlus stepped up its camera game, and Google upended the entire segment with the $399 Pixel 3a, which captures photos that are borderline indistinguishable from those taken on a Pixel 3. Before 2019, cheap phones with very good cameras were impossible to find. That's changing, but sadly, ZTE's latest is not part of that trend.Tinny audioZTE is pushing the Axon 10 Pro's sound-production capabilities, as the phone comes with DTS:X Ultra panoramic surround sound built in (though, once again, strangely not enabled by default).Phone makers rarely tout audio improvements the same way they push photographic or display prowess, so I had high expectations for the Axon 10 Pro's stereo speakers and software. Unfortunately, I was left wondering why ZTE felt compelled to speak up in the first place.Turning that DTS:X feature on from the preinstalled app definitely lends a bit of airiness to audio playback that better envelops the user. But the sound itself is tinny and compressed, with a lack of warmth and a low peak loudness. The Axon 10 Pro stashes its drivers in the earpiece and along the bottom edge, and while the latter driver appears up to the task, that top speaker is woefully underequipped.MORE: Best Wireless Earbuds of 2019If you hold the device with the bottom grille resting on your pinky, which is the way I sometimes hold phones, that anemic earpiece will fail to rise to the occasion every time. That's what happened when I listened to Chastity Belt's ""Rav-4."" Immediately, I noticed something was amiss; the weight of the track's shimmering, aquatic guitar melody was canceled out by the shrillness of those speakers, which also did a number on singer Julia Shapiro's normally rounded, gentle crooning. The cymbals, typically a foil against the song's cavernous soundscape, were lost somewhere high in the mix, struggling to stand out.Messy, dated softwareThe Axon 10 Pro features Android 9 Pie out of the box, which is more than a little frustrating given the proximity of the phone's U.S. release to the Android 10 update last month. While the device hit shelves in some regions in late spring, it didn't go on sale in the U.S. until late August.That means Axon 10 Pro owners have to wait for Android 10, which is expected before the end of the year. In the meantime, you're left with ZTE's flavor of Android 9, which has once again reminded me why I dislike most manufacturers' custom skins.While ZTE has somewhat scaled back its customizations and the number of stock apps it installs (mercifully, Google Photos is the only gallery installed on the device), the interface is still rather ugly and dated. It's nowhere near as elegant as what Google ships on its Pixels, the Android One software on budget models from Nokia and a few other OEMs, or OnePlus' superpolished OxygenOS.Case in point, the tray of persistent apps along the bottom of the Axon 10 Pro's home screen is misaligned with the grid of apps above it. This sort of thing doesn't meaningfully affect your experience in using a phone, but it lends an air of carelessness and a lack quality control. Also, I can't unsee it.But the visuals might be somewhat forgivable if the Axon 10 Pro offered other features to make up for that aesthetic drawback. It doesn't. In fact, there's no system-wide dark theme here and no Digital Wellbeing suite, so the Axon 10 Pro offers less, in terms of features, than what you get from most Android phones nowadays. MORE: Top 7 Android 10 Features That You Should Try FirstFor what it's worth, there is an optional gesture-navigation system onboard that pretty much copies what will come standard on Android 10, and it's fine. There's also a strangely named on-screen button you can elect to use, called Z-Pop, which lives on the edge of the screen. You can use this button to go back, return home or surface your recent apps; it seemed pretty useless when I played around with it.I can forgive an Android front end that isn't pretty to look at if it's at least functional. ZTE's is neither and thus fails to justify its existence.Limited availabilityAlthough the Axon 10 Pro is very reasonably priced, that affordability has unfortunately come at the expense of availability, and not just because no carrier offers the device. The Axon 10 Pro will work only on GSM networks like AT&T, T-Mobile, Metro and Cricket.That means Verizon, Sprint and Boost are out, as well as MVNO carriers that piggyback off the towers of those CDMA networks, like Xfinity Mobile. And unlike OnePlus' phones, the Axon 10 Pro is not certified to work on Verizon's towers as an LTE-only device, so you can't even use that loophole. It's unfortunately a deal breaker for a great many users interested in ZTE's lower-priced flagship phone.I find myself conflicted about the Axon 10 Pro. One one hand, it's an astonishing value. ZTE delivers the right cocktail of specs, like 256GB of storage, an AMOLED display and, of course, that Snapdragon 855 CPU, all for an unbeatable price. This phone is a great alternative to the OnePlus 7T, or a good upgrade from the Pixel 3a XL for those who care more about performance than photography.But unfortunately, the phone's flaws — the humdrum design, the so-so cameras and the careless approach to software — ensure that an alternative to the OnePlus 7T is all the Axon 10 Pro will ever be. It's a bit of a shame, because ZTE has gotten a lot of things right with this phone, especially when you consider where the company was one year ago. The Axon 10 Pro might not top our list of the best unlocked phones, but it comes close."
134,OnePlus 7T Pro Hands-on,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oneplus-7t-pro,"OnePlus’ specialty is providing Android flagships with fancy features but at a reasonable price. While the original OnePlus 7 Pro released this spring was the company’s most expensive phone yet, it was still a fantastic device that we found to be worth every penny. Now OnePlus has introduced the £699 OnePlus 7T Pro, a modest upgrade to the original. While the standard OnePlus 7T, revealed in September, has gotten a lot of attention for its more extensive overhaul, there’s still a few interesting changes to look at here. It’s just a shame that the 7T Pro is not going to be available in the US, where the 7 Pro remains available and the $599 7T hits stores Oct. 18. (The 7T launches in Europe on Oct. 17, where it will cost £549.)Picking up the OnePlus 7T Pro feels instantly familiar to anyone who’s held the 7 Pro. The new phone remains large and heavy like its predecessor, around the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus or an iPhone 11 Pro Max and slightly heavier than both those phones because of the OnePlus pop-up camera. Still, the OnePlus 7T Pro is not uncomfortable to hold. The curved sides of the phone help it fit in your hand, and the weight feels well balanced through the length of the phone. If you flip it over, you’ll see the new (and only) color option for the 7T Pro: Haze Blue. This is a lighter version of the original 7 Pro’s Nebula Blue, a change made thanks to feedback from OnePlus’ users. I think it’s a very attractive hue, but as you’ll see is a bit of a theme for the 7T Pro, you don’t get a choice even if you don’t like it.The OnePlus 7T Pro’s display, unchanged from the 7 Pro, still looks and feels great to use even if the regular OnePlus 7T has now stolen its 90Hz refresh rate thunder. The quad HD 6.6-inch AMOLED screen will transport you through menus apps and webpages smoothly and colorfully thanks to the enhanced refresh rate, although the original 7 Pro wasn’t super bright in comparison to rival phones. It was hard to tell if this was still the case with the new handset after my short time with it, but it’s something to be mindful of.The camera hardware on the OnePlus 7T Pro is unchanged from the previous model — a 48MP wide sensor, 16MP ultra-wide lens and 8MP telephoto sensor providing a 3x optical zoom. Up front, you get a 16MP selfie camera in a pop-up module. The new phone gets some new camera software offering new photo modes, though. You now have access to NightScape mode and a new macro mode with the ultrawide lens. Both the wide camera and telephoto lens have access to portrait mode. And OnePlus promises a “superstable” video mode, too. All of these features are available on the OnePlus 7T, which has the same abilities and cameras as the Pro model, other than having a 2x optical zoom 12MP telephoto lens instead of the 7T Pro's more powerful telephoto camera. If it’s the 7T Pro’s camera capabilities that are impressing you, you may want to think about buying the cheaper model instead, assuming you live in a market where both the OnePlus 7T Pro and 7T will be available.You only have one option for the internal specs of the 7T Pro, but they’re fairly formidable all the same. The processor has been swapped from the Snapdragon 855 inside the OnePlus 7 Pro to the newer Snapdragon 855 Plus. RAM on the new model has been locked at 8GB, as has the storage at 256GB. The new processor is definitely going to be an asset when you’re using the phone daily — the Snapdragon 855 Plus offers a graphic boost, for example — but it would have been nice to get a 12GB option like we had with the original 7 Pro.The battery powering the OnePlus 7T Pro has been slightly upgraded. It’s got a whole 85mAh extra compared to the 7 Pro, which will should you a few more much needed minutes of battery life. The original 7 Pro had a less than satisfactory battery life performance according to our Tom’s Guide battery test, so hopefully the extra capacity will help address that. More interesting is Warp Charge 30T, which manages to improve charging speeds, particularly at low percentages, through software improvements. The 7T Pro still uses the same charging plug as the original OnePlus 7 Pro, which sounds like a smart way to do it, but we’ll have to check this out ourselves to see how much of a difference this makes.  Like the OnePlus 7T, the Pro model ships with Android 10 and OnePlus’ OxygenOS. I really like OxygenOS for its style and its small number of effective additions to stock Android, and Android 10 itself is a big step up from Android 9 Pie. Ignoring the lack of a 12GB RAM option, the 7T Pro is on the whole a small upgrade on the 7 Pro, making what was already great just a little bit greater. The changes should be enough to convince users of older OnePlus phones to switch, but probably not enough to convince existing 7 Pro users to trade in.At £699 (that's $865 if you do a straight conversion to U.S. dollars, though phone makers typically adjust pricing by region), the OnePlus 7T Pro is still a good deal if you’re happy with the phone’s size. But the OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7 Pro — both of which are available in both the U.S. and UK — are still worth considering for providing near identical specs for a smaller price."
135,iOS 13,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/ios-13,"Update, Sept. 24: Apple has released iOS 13.1, which addresses many of the bugs in the initial iOS 13 release while also enabling new features.iOS 13 is a big update. There are two major changes that will change the way you use your iPhone — Dark Mode and Sign in with Apple — and Apple gives some long-time apps impressive overhauls in Photos and Maps. Other tweaks are going to need a little bit more time to come into their own.Overall, it's a solid effort that figures to become an even more vital upgrade, especially now that Apple is rolling out subsequent point updates to iron out some of the kinks. (iOS 13.1, released less than a week after iOS 13's initial debut stamps out a lot of bugs and enables some features not available with the original update.) Here's a closer look at what you get with iOS 13 and whether or not you should take the plunge now or wait.Before we talk about iOS 13's features, let's make sure you've got an iPhone capable of running the new software. iOS 13 works on the iPhone 6s and later, as well as the iPhone SE and 7th-generation iPod touch. If you're buying one of Apple's new iPhones — the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11 Pro Max — iOS 13 is already preinstalled, so the question of Update to iOS 13 or Not has been answered for you.The iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 5s were all able to run iOS 12, but that support ends now that iOS 13 is here. Those devices are now at least five years old, and Apple likes to make sure that supported devices are still capable of running most of the new features, so it's understandable why these older phones are being left behind. (Just be glad you're not running Android, where software upgrades become few and far between after two years of use.)""Hey,"" you may be crying out, ""what about my iPad?"" Your software update is available separately, my tablet-using friend, as your days of sharing a mobile OS with the iPhone have come to an end. Apple offers a separate version now, iPadOS, which arrived at the same time as iOS 13.1. You'll get a lot of the same features here, plus a few iPad-specific additions involving things like multitasking support, home screen improvements and the ability to use a mouse with your tablet.These days, every operating system worth its salt is offering some variation on a dark theme in which the black text and light background are flipped around. It's ideal for when the lights are low, and on some phones — particularly those with OLED screens — it eases the strain on your battery. Plus, some people think darker themed screens just look cool.Well, Dark Mode has come to the iPhone with iOS 13. And you know what? The darker screen looks pretty cool.I confess to being a Dark Mode skeptic, chalking up the clamor for this feature to people with a heightened appreciation for aesthetics. But then I learned that Dark Mode actually fits in nicely with how I use my iPhone.Because I like to work at the same time as my colleagues on the opposite side of the country, my alarm goes off at Stupid O'Clock each morning in California. With the lights out, I spend a few moments in bed, going through email, checking headlines and getting a sense of what the day ahead holds for me.In our pre-Dark Mode era, the light streaming from my phone's display would sometimes disturb my wife, forcing me to either build a pillow fort so I could look at my iPhone or risk a drowsily muttered curse. I was a Dark Mode skeptic, but it fits in nicely with how I use my iPhone.With Dark Mode enabled, I can get caught up on the day ahead without bothering my wife, at least when I'm using apps that support the feature. That's the built-in iOS 13 apps, naturally, and a few third-party options like Twitter that have already added Dark Mode features of their own. Other apps will have to add support for iOS 13's Dark Mode, something that's likely to happen in rapid order now that iOS 13 is widely available.Apple's made it dead simple to manage Dark Mode. Just go into Settings and head for the Display & Brightness section. I've set Dark Mode to turn on automatically at sunset, switching back to iOS's light view once the sun is up. You can customize your own Dark Mode schedule or just turn on the feature forever. Dark Mode also works in conjunction with Night Shift, the iOS setting that can adjust the color of your screen to more warmer colors in the evening, easing the eye strain caused by blue light. Dark Mode complements the ambient lighting True Tone feature on newer iPhones, too.Opening up a new app on your iPhone these days occasionally puts you in the position of having to either create yet another mobile account to monitor or log in with your credentials from Facebook, Google or elsewhere. The latter method is convenience, but you're still left considering whether the privacy trade-off is worth it.iOS 13 introduces a new way to sign into an app or a website on your phone that balances convenience and privacy. Sign In with Apple lets you use your Apple ID account to log in, verifying your sign in either with Face ID on newer iPhones or Touch ID if you'd prefer to use a fingerprint reader. All you're providing upon sign in is your name and email address, and even that latter piece of information can be disguised. Using Sign in with Apple in iOS 13 is ridiculously easy.Sign In with Apple gives you the option of hiding your email address by using Apple's email relay service instead. In this scenario, Apple creates a unique, random email address and forwards any communications sent out by the app or website to your actual email.This is another one of those features where app makers will have to build in support to their current offerings. A handful, including Kayak, Fretello and Kitchen Stories supported the feature when iOS 13 launched Sept. 19, and signing into those services with iOS 13's new feature is ridiculously easy. Tap the Sign In with Apple option, and a pop-up menu asks you to confirm, along with the option of sharing your email address or having Apple whip one up for you. You can turn off mail forwarding by heading to Settings, tapping your name, and selecting Password and Security where you manage apps that are using your Apple ID.It's early days yet, but I expect this will be one of the most popular additions to iOS 13 if it's embraced by lots of app makers. Who wouldn't want more control over what personal details they're sharing with other people?I haven't spent a lot of time in the Photos app of past versions of iOS because I've found the interface has gotten a little cluttered, making it hard to find the photo I'm looking for on occasion. Apple's previous efforts to make Photos more engaging — improved search tools here, new ways of surfacing old photos there — just haven't landed with me. iOS 13's take on Photos, though, is much more welcoming. And it's all thanks to the addition of a strip of options above the redesigned Photos tab.Apple now gives you the option of organizing Photos into Days, Months or Years. (There's also an All Photos view, but it's the sprawling look at every image you've got stored on your phone that I've found so off-putting in the past.) Days is my favorite look, as it weeds out duplicate pictures of the same subject and other clutter like screenshots to just highlight best shots you've taken in a given day, organized in an appealing collage.If you've shot videos or Live Photos, those will play as you scroll by (thankfully, with the sound off). You can even have Photos play a dynamically assembled movie of a particular day's shots.The Months and Years views have their charms, too. Months groups your photos together into collections of single events — a bunch of photos I took of my town's Independence Day parade are in one collection while a family vacation to Paris are in another.Years surfaces photos that you took around this same time in previous years — a baseball game I went to four years ago in Chicago currently highlights the 2015 collection — and if you linger on the Years view, photo highlights from a given year will cycle through. It's a very thoughtful way of finding photos you may have forgotten you've even taken.Photographic improvements don't end with curating photos. You've also got new editing tools at your disposal in iOS 13, including the ability to adjust a picture's vibrance and white balance and you can control the intensity of adjustments, too. If you want to see how your editing decisions are affecting a particular area of your shoot, you can pinch to zoom in. And most of the editing changes you can make to photos are applicable to videos as well.I love the compactness of my iPhone SE, but that 4-inch screen does not lend itself to a lot of photo editing. Still, I was able to use iOS 13's editing tools to touch up a shot of a hot dog that had too much of a bluish cast for my taste. And after trimming an overly long video of a marching band, I also fine-tuned its exposure and experimented with some filters. Fortunately, iOS 13 features nondestructive video edits so I could go back to the original when my edits got a little excessive.iOS 13's changes to Maps have been in the making for a while. Apple has spent more than a year rebuilding its map, with more accurate details — not just the big things like roads and highways, but also paths, trails and airports too. The company says it drove more than 4 million miles in its effort to make the Maps app a better way to get around.Look Around is similar in Street View in Google Maps, but I find Apple's approach more immersive and easier to scroll around.Did that effort pay off? For me, it did, because I happen to live in California, which is one of the states where Apple's new master map is available. The company says the improved map will roll out across the whole country by the end of the year, but there's a chance that it won't be available in your area now that iOS 13 has arrived.Another Maps feature that Apple is implementing in stages is Look Around, which gives you a high-resolution ground-level look at the area you're looking up in Maps. It's similar to the Street View in Google Maps, though I find Apple's approach more immersive and easier to scroll around. I've already used Look Around to confirm that I was in the right spot of a meeting even when the directions weren't so clear, but again, I live in the Bay Area, where Look Around is already available. Expect Apple to build this feature out over time, too.Apple has made two other additions to Maps that are available to everyone. Favorites lets you store frequently searched locations, saving you the trouble of having to type in the same search term over and over again. I find it particularly helpful for looking up the closing times for businesses I frequent but whose operating hours I haven't committed to memory.Similar to Favorites, Collections also lets you store places in Maps, and I've been using that tool to research an upcoming business trip, gathering all the places I need to be into one folder. I imagine Collections will make Maps a much more vital tool when it comes to planning trips.If you take a lot of public transit like I do, you'll appreciate that Maps now shows actual arrival and departure times for buses, trains and other transit options — not just the scheduled time. You can also be alerted if there's going to be slowdowns along the way.The Reminders app also got an overhaul, though I don't think it's as successful as the improvements to Photos and Maps. My preferred method of interacting with Reminders is just to create one using Siri, but Apple seems to think I should be spending more time in Reminders, adding additional details to my to-dos.A quick toolbar now appears when you create a reminder, allowing you to add a date, location or image to your task. But I've found that adding more specifics like exact times for a reminder require you to drill down into an interface that's not always easy to scroll through. (Apple uses a scroll wheel to set the time for reminders, and scrolling to information below it causes you to sometimes inadvertently edit the time of your reminder.) Apple lets you add attachments, photos and web links to reminders, which makes this built-in app more competitive with third-party tasks managers, but overkill if all you want to do is remind yourself to pick up eggs on the way home.There is one addition to Reminders that I appreciate. You can now tag people in a reminder so that interacting them with Messages will trigger whatever reminder you've tagged. Texting my wife is not the most intuitive way to remind myself about upcoming appointments, but it does ensure that an important to-do won't escape my attention. Be prepared for some changes in how you interact with your phone in iOS 13. iPhones running iOS 13 use standardized long presses to bring up shortcuts and additional commands similar to the Haptic Touch features introduced with last year's iPhone XR. The long press can bring up some handy commands — press on a song title in the Music app, and you'll have the option of viewing other tracks from that album or adding the song to a playlist; long-pressing an email brings up more standard features like a preview of the email along with different response options.Some third-party apps support long presses, some don't — the MLB At Bat app has schedule and scoreboard info for my favorite team. Discovering what exactly the feature can do will require some exploration on your part.But the addition of long presses across iPhones changes one iOS behavior you may have gotten used to over the years — deleting apps. You used to take care of that by long-pressing on an app until it began to shake like a bowl full of about-to-be-deleted jelly. Now that long press simply brings up a list of shortcuts. You've got to keep pressing until the apps start shaking, and that's a delay that's going to take some getting used to.Apple is promising under-the-hood improvements in iOS 13, such as smaller app sizes, thanks to a new way of packaging apps. Those same apps are supposed to launch faster, too, and while I haven't noticed that improvement in my testing, my iPhone SE certainly hasn't slowed down any since I installed iOS 13.More importantly, I haven't seen a sudden drop in battery life that an OS update can sometimes introduce. Since my SE is on the older end of the spectrum of supported phones, I think that bodes well for other devices upgrading to iOS 13.I don't know if the Siri assistant has gotten any smarter this time around, though Apple has taken pains to fine-tune the Shortcuts feature introduced last year. That app is now built into iOS 13. The new iOS 13.1 update improves Shortcuts even further by letting shortcuts run automatically depending on the conditions you set.I like that Siri now chirps a helpful ""Done"" when it's carried out a shortcut, and it sounds a little more natural, too, even if it stumbles on the occasional word. (Reading a text message back to me from my daughter's teacher, Siri pronounced ""notebook"" as if it were two separate words, so some improvement's still needed.) If I list every change that's in iOS 13, we'll be here until the iOS 14 beta rolls around. Suffice it to say, there are a number of changes that some people will find useful (the Health app can now track menstrual cycles) and others I can't imagine ever having a need for (Messages now includes a host of Memoji stickers).If you've got an iPhone with a TrueDepth front camera, you'll find three new Animojis and new ways to customize your Memoji by adding things like makeup and piercings. Anyone who's used Find My Phone or Find My Friends will find those tasks merged into a single app, with the promise that the new iPhone 11 models will be able to one day take advantage of their U1 chips to better pinpoint the locations of other U1-equipped devices.These are the additional changes in iOS 13 that caught my eye.Voice Control: Head to Accessibility in the Settings app, and you can turn on Voice Control, which lets you control most of your iPhone's functions with the sound of your voice. I was able to use Voice Control to open apps, dictate a note and even navigate a web page using numbered labels to select areas on a web page. Voice Control didn't always hear me clearly, and it will take some effort to learn the feature's specialized commands, but this has a real potential to improve iPhone accessibility.Sharing your arrival time with friends: Another great addition to Maps that also expands Message's feature set is Share My ETA, now available to everyone with the release of iOS 13.1. Get directions to a location in Maps, and you'll have the option to tap on a Share ETA button. A window feature frequently accessed contacts will pop up, and by selecting one, you can send them a message letting them know when you're set to arrive; they'll also get updates if you run into any delays. Better Wi-Fi controls: When I've been out and about with my iPhone, occasionally, I'll get a new notification that there's an accessible public Wi-Fi network near by. The notifications are pretty fleeting and appear too inconsistently to rely upon at this point, but it's clear Apple wants to make it easier to find a Wi-Fi network without having to dig into Settings. An even better approach lives in Command Center — long press on the Wi-Fi icon, and a list of available networks now pops up.Volume Control: I like to play the occasional game, whether it's PUBG Mobile or something a bit more casual. What I'm less crazy about is when I go to adjust my iPhone's volume, and a volume overlay appears in the middle of the screen, obscuring my view of the game. iOS 13 moves the volume control to the side of the screen and turns it into a slide that you can adjust with your finger instead of having to press on volume controls.Whenever someone asks about whether to upgrade to a new version of iOS, I always hesitate a little. While the features and enhancements Apple adds with each major release are enough to justify an upgrade, sometimes, you'll want to wait, just to make sure that the bugs are all ironed out. Reports about iOS 13 suggested many, many bugs — I escaped most of them, since I used the iOS 13 beta to test the update, and beta testers were already on iOS 13.1 by the time the main iOS 13 arrived Sept. 19.Now that iOS 13.1 is available to everyone, I think it's safe to upgrade, as the new version irons out most — though not all — of the those initial release kinks. Plus, you get new features, too. Still, extremely cautious users may want to give it a day or two to make sure that any show-stopping bugs are well and truly killed by iOS 13.1 before they take the plunge. For the most part, though, you can upgrade with confidence at this stage.The improvements to Photos and Maps would be enough to justify an update to iOS 13. But Apple seals the deal with welcome enhancements like its more private approach to app sign ins and a well-implemented dark mode. Apart from some minor quirks that you'll likely get used to as time goes by, iOS 13 gets a lot of things right in the name of improving your iPhone experience."
136,Asus ROG Phone 2 Hands-on,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/asus-rog-phone-2,"Editors' Note: Updated at 6:16 p.m. ET with additional specs.The Asus ROG Phone 2 is here and it’s a beast of an Android phone. This is the first gaming smartphone with an overclockable Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 Plus CPU for a serious power boost. It also sports a 120Hz OLED display and a massive 6,000 mAh battery.  However, all that power won’t come cheap, as the ROG Phone II is priced at $899 to start. I went hands on with the ROG Phone 2 and while I have to say I’m impressed with its overall performance and improvements, I’m not sure if I need a dedicated gaming phone. However, Asus is making a persuasive argument for hardcore mobile gamers. The ROG 2 has the same polarizing look as the original and I’m here for it. The rear panel is still as shiny as ever, complete with a huge customizable backlit ROG logo dead center. I’m still a fan of the slate gray and copper color scheme, particularly the way it accentuates the rear vent. You’ll still find the side-mounted USB Type-C port/accessory port on the left, the power button on the right and another USB Type-C port along the bottom. The haptic air triggers have been upgraded but are still located on the right side of the smartphone. Asus has yet to disclose the actual dimensions of the phone, but if the display is anything to go by, this is a massive phone. The first ROG Phone weighed in at 7.1 ounces, and measured 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches.The ROG Phone 2 has a lot of firsts, including having a massive 6.6-inch display that’s AMOLED, HDR and has a 120-Hertz refresh rate with less than 1 millisecond of latency. That meant that when I was playing MegaMan Mobile, the titular hero’s blue chassis popped on the screen along with his red-colored foes. The framerates stayed smooth as I dodged, blasted and jumped my way through the level. Like I said previously, the ROG Phone 2 has a lot of firsts going for it, and here’s another one. It’s the first gaming smartphone to utilize Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 Plus Mobile Platform. That means that similar to its predecessor, the ROG Phone II’s Qualcomm Kryo 485 CPU can be overclocked to a max boost speed of 2.96-GHz, which makes it one of the most powerful Android phones out there. I’m curious as to how it would hold up against the iPhone 11, however. For the GPU, you have an Adreno 640 graphics chip, that Asus and Qualcomm claim is 15% faster than regular 855 CPU. Add in Qualcomm’s Elite Gaming technology, which focuses on smoother rendering and power efficiency, and you’ve got a serious powerhouse on your hands. To help things stay cool when the action heats up, Asus has upgraded its vapor-chamber cooling system. Outside of the souped up CPU and GPU, you get 12GB of RAM and 512GB of RAM as well as Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0. The rear camera is a whopping 48 megapixels while the front shooter is a13-MP sensor with ultra-wide lens and laser autofocus.Asus is also offering an Ultimate version of the ROG Phone 2 which comes in matte black and bumps the storage up to 1TB. Pricing and availability have yet to be announced for this version of the phone.Gaming for an extended period of time can really take a toll on your smartphone’s battery life. To give gamers as much battery life as possible, Asus found a way to cram a gigantic 6,000mAH battery into the ROG Phone 2. The original only had a 4,000mAH battery and tapped out after 8 hours and 59 minutes on our battery test. I really can’t wait to see how long this sequel is going to last.The ROG Phone 2 still offers a number of accessories to augment game play. My colleague and I played a fighting game with the smartphone docked into the WiGig adapter. which allowed us to play on the TV with a pair of Asus-branded controllers.But if you want to play solo, there’s the ROG Kunai Gamepad. You simply snap the phone into the holder and it plays like a traditional handheld gaming device. And if you want more screen real estate (and who doesn’t?) there’s the new TwinView Dock II.Asus has yet to reveal pricing for the new accessories, but if they’re anything like the original ROG Phone’s accoutrements, they won’t be cheap. Asus is doubling down on the gaming smartphone market and refining it. The ROG Phone 2 retains the polarizing gamer aesthetic, but expands on the things that made the first smartphone great in the first place –– the performance and the display. I’m not convinced that all that power really translates to gaming, but when the ROG Phone 2 is in my hands, I’m sucked into whatever game I’m playing and that’s really the point. I’m eager to put all that powerful hardware up against some of the heavy hitters in the smartphone world to see who comes out on top."
137,Moto G7,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-g7,review-6286.html","Sticker shock typically comes with the most expensive handsets, from $1,000 iPhones to futuristic, foldable marvels of technology that cost twice as much. But these days, even budget phones are getting pricier, and you needn't look further than the brand-new Moto G7 for proof.At $299, Motorola's latest smartphone for the masses costs $50 more than last year's Moto G6 did at launch, $70 more than 2017's Moto G5 and $100 more than the Moto G4. That's alarming at first glance, but only until you recognize the lengths to which Motorola goes to justify the added expense.From its surprising performance to its stunning display and premium software, the Moto G7 packs value that's rare to find, even at that higher price. It's not quite the midrange alternative it once was, but the Moto G7 is still one of the best phones you can get for the money.The $299 Moto G7 is the most well-equipped model in a family of three phones that also includes the $249 Moto G7 Power and $199 Moto G7 Play. All three are sold unlocked with support for all carriers, whether CDMA- or GSM-based. There's also a fourth variant — the more powerful G7 Plus — though that phone will skip the North American market.You won't be able to buy the Moto G7 directly from your carrier — unless your carrier is Google Fi, that is. Like the Moto G6 before it, the G7 will be fully supported by and sold through Google Fi, the company's pay-what-you-use wireless service. But the phone won't be stocked at other networks' stores, so you'd be best-served buying yours direct from Motorola or third-party retailers like Best Buy, B&H and Amazon. Speaking of Amazon, the site is now offering a version of the G7 with Alexa hands-free functionality built in for $50 off.Thanks to a display that's half an inch larger than the one inside the Moto G6, the Moto G7 feels like a much bigger phone than the one it's replacing. Motorola has given the G7 a teardrop-style notch to maximize the new phone's screen coverage, but the bezels up top and below are still quite chunky. The result is far from the most elegant budget device I've seen.In fact, in a lot of ways, the Moto G7 simply looks like a poor man's OnePlus 6T. It's got the same basic shape, but everything's a bit off. The rounded corners of the display don't fully conform to the curvature of the frame, and that bottom bezel — which housed a front-facing fingerprint sensor on the G6 — is still almost as substantial, but now just wastes that space on the Motorola logotype.The rest of the G7 is actually quite familiar. Our Ceramic Black unit couples a curved sheet of glass on the back with glossy black polycarbonate edges (make no mistake, though — this is not made of ceramic). And the phone packages its dual cameras in Motorola's trademark circular housing, with a rear-facing fingerprint sensor beneath it.In a lot of ways, the Moto G7 simply looks like a low-rent OnePlus 6T.This isn't a very exciting phone to hold or look at — and, in truth, neither was the G6. But at least the outgoing model offered an extremely pocketable size and felt very comfortable in the hand.MORE: Moto G7 vs. G7 Power vs. G7 Play: Which Phone Should You Buy?The G7 is still rated water repellent (not water resistant), and although, thankfully, the device retains its headphone jack, Motorola still hasn't added NFC to the mix this year. So, you won't be able to make Google Pay mobile payments with this budget phone.On paper, you wouldn't think much of the Moto G7's 6.2-inch LCD display. With a resolution of 2270 x 1080, it's certainly sharp enough, but so are many of the LCD panels in budget phones these days.Where the G7's screen really stands out is in its consistency. Last year's G6 also had a sharp, colorful LCD panel, though that display suffered at off-center viewing angles and didn't get particularly bright, either. The G7 delivers a captivating image in all conditions, no matter how you hold the phone.Watching the Netflix's new documentary series, Formula 1: Drive to Survive, on Motorola's handset, my eyes widened at the picturesque, undulating hills surrounding Austria's Red Bull Ring, the lights of the garage shimmering off driver Daniel Ricciardo's visor, and the rippling sea of green-and-white flags draped over the circuit's grandstands.The G7 delivers a captivating image in all conditions, no matter how you hold the phone.My experience was substantiated by the G7's impressive numbers. On our light meter, the device notched a respectable peak brightness of 445 nits. That's higher than the 413 nits of the Moto G6 and within a shout of the 452 nits from the Nokia 7.1, which costs $50 more than the G7.Robust color is to be expected, and the G7 showed that, with a sRGB-gamut coverage of 135 percent in the phone's Natural color mode. That eclipses the more-muted hues of the Moto G6, which notched 113 percent, but falls short of the punchier Nokia 7.1's 164 percent result.MORE: The Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesOn color accuracy, the G7 was practically dead-even with the competition, as well. The Moto phone registered a Delta-E score of 0.34, compared to 0.33 for the HDR10-compliant Nokia 7.1. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) While the G7 doesn't technically support the industry standard for dynamic range, you'd be hard-pressed to notice any deficiencies; the display really does look that good.On the back of the Moto G7, you'll find two cameras: one 12-megapixel sensor tied to an f/1.8 lens alongside a secondary 5-MP-depth sensor. An 8-MP shooter is tasked with selfie duty on the front.The Moto G7 uses those stereoscopic lenses to produce a range of artistic effects. Aside from the requisite Portrait Mode, there's also Spot Color, which allows you to selectively illuminate specific aspects of the frame in color, and Cinemagraph, which creates GIFs with partial movement.Those novelties are nice, but they're hardly new to Motorola's handsets. Where it counts, the G7 is merely another serviceable shooter that struggles to stand out from the midrange crowd.That's not to say this phone camera doesn't have its moments of glory. There were aspects of the G7's attempt at this picturesque, almost-spring Bryant Park scene that I enjoyed when I compared it to the same shot from the OnePlus 6T, a device that costs $250 more. For one, the contrast and sharpness are much more pronounced through Motorola's camera.Of course, the OnePlus 6T is stronger overall, especially because it doesn't distort the edges of the image like the G7 does. However, that's what you'd expect from a $549 device.Unfortunately, I don't have quite so much praise for the G7's shallow-depth-of-field portraits, which took on a surreal, painterly quality when I used the feature to snap a photo of my colleague Phillip. The heavy, imprecise bokeh, coupled with the software's inability to detect the boundaries of the foreground really don't do the G7 any favors here.New for the G7 is Hi-Res Zoom, a feature that, much like Super Res Zoom on the Pixel 3, is designed to preserve the clarity of a shot when you're digitally zooming.MORE: Moto G7 Hands-on Review: The Best Phone Under $300 Gets BetterAs it happens, the OnePlus 6T packs similar technology, and I found Motorola's implementation to fall short by comparison when I closed in on the statue above. The G7's rendition is a little less grainy than the OnePlus' version, which I appreciate, though it's also a whole lot darker. The boosted sharpness from Moto's attempt does make the inscription slightly more legible, but the consequence is a shot that's a little less realistic to my eye.Indoors, the G7 continued to struggle, producing a hazy, noisy shot that completely fails to rein in the highlights of the light fixtures. The texture of the tile ceiling is totally lost on Motorola'’s device as well.Often, the G7 tries far too hard to inject vivid color into images when those shades plainly aren't there. The phone's 8-MP, front-facing shooter did something borderline inhuman with my skin tone in this selfie. I look almost like the subject of a Polaroid that's been left out in the sun too long.If you're in the market for a sub-$300 phone with a better camera, the Galaxy A20 is worth consideration. It's not quite as well-rounded as the G7, but beats it in the camera category.No matter which Moto G7 you buy, you get the same Snapdragon 632 processor. In the G7, that chipset is mated to 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, generous amounts for a relatively inexpensive device. This also gives us faith that the G7 should last you for a good while before getting bogged down, as old phones do.Coming after my daily driver, a Pixel 3, the Moto G7 felt surprisingly responsive, and it never left me reaching for Google's flagship out of frustration. App switching and animations happen in a snap, and I didn't feel as though I was testing the phone's limits until I fired up some games.On Geekbench 4, a benchmark that measures overall system performance, the budget Moto came up strong, with a score of 4,814, compared to the 3,934 achieved by the G6. The G7 also drew awfully close to the Nokia 7.1's 4,934 score, even though that phone is powered by a more capable Snapdragon 636 chipset.Coming after my Pixel 3, the Moto G7 felt surprisingly responsive, and it never left me reaching for Google's flagship out of frustration.The G7's 3DMark graphics showing was less encouraging. On the Ice Storm Unlimited test — one designed for midrange and low-end devices — the G7 and its dated Adreno 506 GPU managed 14,724. That's better than any G-Series handset before this one, but the Nokia 7.1 still outperformed Motorola's best efforts here, maxing this test.Running the more demanding Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 benchmark, the G7 topped out at a measly 512 points, while the Nokia 7.1 turned in 950. For reference, the most powerful smartphones, like the recently released Galaxy S10, are capable of scores exceeding 5,500.The Moto G7 is not built for gaming, but then, no budget handset really is. That said, you can get by running some titles at minimal settings. PUBG Mobile and Real Racing 3 run smoothly enough, so long as you turn the graphics down.MORE: A Guide to No Contract and Prepaid Phone PlansSome newer and more-demanding titles, like racer Asphalt 9: Legends, are marred with perpetually choppy frame rates that force the games to display at an extremely low resolution just to maintain any semblance of playability. Avid gamers beware: If you're looking for a less expensive route to console-quality mobile titles, the OnePlus 6T remains your best option.The Moto G7 may be a lot bigger than the G6, but strangely enough, the new phone's battery isn't much bigger than the old one's. In fact, at 3,000 mAh, this year's midrange Moto has exactly the same battery capacity as last year's model, despite powering a display that's half an inch larger, as well as a beefier processor and more RAM.It's hardly surprising, then, that the Moto G7 lasts shorter on a charge than the G6 did. In our battery test, the G7 endured for 8 hours and 50 minutes of endlessly streaming web pages off T-Mobile's LTE network before running out of juice, compared to 9 hours and 35 minutes for the G6. Both phones far exceed the Nokia 7.1's 7:41 result but are put to shame by the $269 Nokia 6.1's marathon endurance of 10:34. Those who are interested in the G7 but are really mindful about battery life should also consider the $249 Moto G7 Power, which comes with a 5,000-mAh battery.Motorola's packed-in, 15-watt TurboPower charger might pale in comparison with some of the faster wired-charging technologies we've seen lately, like OnePlus' 30-watt Warp Charge spec. However, the TurboPower still has enough juice to provide the G7 with 9 hours of typical usage (by Motorola's estimation, anyway) after being plugged in for just 15 minutes. In our testing, the device went from zero to 26 percent in that time while connected to the stock adapter, and up to 47 percent after 30 minutes.If you've used any Motorola phone within the last few years, you'll find that the G7's software experience is largely the same. Mind you, that's not a bad thing by any means.The G7 runs Android 9 Pie out of the box, and the look and feel of Moto's flavor of Android is functionally stock. You'd be hard-pressed to discern any differences between it and the Android One software on Nokia's handsets. The only differences come in a few bespoke widgets and the Moto app, which unlocks an assortment of shortcuts, gestures and features designed to make your phone easier to use. And in the case of the G7, they actually do so.Motorola's custom gesture controls are among the best you'll find on Android and a good sight better than Google's own attempts on the Pixel. You can still tap to go home and hold to summon Google Assistant. But the other actions are intuitive, too, like swiping back to go back and swiping right to switch to the last used app. And if you don't like these controls, you don't have to use them; in fact, they're not even activated by default.Motorola once again baked Dolby Audio enhancement into the latest G-Series device. However, the software didn't seem to help much, as New Order's bass-driven classic ""Thieves Like Us"" was rendered tinny and gutless through the G7's lone bottom-firing speaker. Part of this is likely a byproduct of the speaker's placement; the G6 housed its only speaker in the phone's earpiece, which boosted the presence of music and video. In steering away from this design with the G7, Motorola is really taking a step back, and Dolby Audio doesn't make up for it.Motorola's gesture controls are among the best you'll find on Android.Moto G7 owners can expect one significant platform update to Android Q either at the end of this year or early in 2020. That's standard for budget devices, though security updates will persist for two years.Despite its shortcomings, the Moto G7 remains a good value. Few phones, even at $299, guarantee the level of performance and software polish that Motorola is offering, and the fact that the G7 is compatible with every carrier under the sun in the U.S. is a notable plus, too.That said, G7's design isn't as elegant as what Nokia's been pumping out lately, and the battery life is shorter on the G7 than on the G6. And for all the camera's creative toys, the photos it captures are really just average.Budget phones used to be purely pragmatic purchases, the kind you make just because the numbers make sense. The Moto G7 is an excellent handset on paper, and it should last you a good while, too. But today, there are cheap phones you might actually be excited to own, and I'm afraid this isn't one of them.Credit: Tom's Guide"
138,Oppo Reno 10x Zoom,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/oppo-reno-10x-zoom,"Oppo is still a new name in phones for people outside of Asia, even though it's been around for almost 20 years and developed quite a following in and around its home market of China. Oppo's RX17 launched in the United Kingdom earlier this year, but that device had launched in China in August of last year. The Reno, the company's new, photography-focused smartphone, is the first (roughly) simultaneous product launch the make has had, with the debut coming just two months after the Chinese launch.In the last 12 months, we've seen both the Huawei P30 Pro and the Google Pixel 3 dominate the market for best camera phones, and the OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10 have upped the ante for flagship features. The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom, the high-end version of Oppo's latest smartphone product line, doesn't initially look like it could compete with those handsets. But with some neat ideas of its own and a few more cribbed from rivals and stablemates, Oppo has shipped a convincing competitor to the established brands, adding a few features that will really turn heads.You can buy the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom and the standard Reno from a handful of online retailers, including Amazon, from £545 (roughly $660 when converted) for the lowest-spec version (6GB/128GB). You can also buy the 5G version on an EE contract in the U.K., in case you like the sound of this phone and want a handset that's ready for the new mobile-data standard.For our U.S. readers, no normal cell carriers offer the Reno. This means that online retailers like Amazon or Newegg are the best places for importing the device. However, the version of the phone you get may not work with all U.S. cellular networks and you're unlikely to get support from your wireless carrier.MORE: The Best and Worst Phone Carriers of 2019Oppo also sells the two other versions of the Reno in the U.K. There's the standard Reno, which starts at £450 and behaves the same as this version but lacks the zoom lens. The budget Reno Z starts at $300 and also cuts out the pop-up camera in favor of a water-drop notch, while lowering the power of some of the interior components. We've yet to get our hands on these versions for a test, though.With the Reno, Oppo has mastered the art of looking inconspicuous. There's no notch or punch-hole, because the Reno 10x Zoom features a pop-up front camera. Instead, you get a clean display, aside from a small chin bezel and a smaller forehead, which also features a small slot for the top speaker.The Reno's most distinct feature is the phone's pop-up mechanism. When you activate the selfie camera, the Reno deploys the module (which houses the camera and top speaker on the front side and a flash/flashlight on the rear side). This happens via a quiet and fast-pivoting mechanism, rather than via the standard, rising module we've seen on phones like the OnePlus 7 Pro. The Reno’s ""shark fin"" style module is a lot more obtrusive than the 7 Pro's take on the pop up, but the fin is still smaller than the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3's slider mechanism or the Asus ZenFone 6's flipping camera.On the back of the Reno, there's a darker, central vertical stripe that bears the Oppo logo and the three rear cameras. This is the most distinct part of the phone, and while I'm not wild about it, it's at least unique to the Reno. You'll also see that the phone's body completely houses the rear cameras, a design that looks a lot tidier than the ""camera bump"" approach many manufacturers are pursuing, even if Oppo's choice does mean extra width.The only thing that does extend from the phone's back surface is the O-Dot, a rounded, metal point located a few inches down from the top of the phone. Oppo added this to keep the device slightly raised even when placed flat on its back, protecting it from scratches and dirt. I'm always terrified of damaging phones whenever they're not safely tucked into a case, so I appreciate this gesture toward addressing my very specific neurosis.A black case comes with the phone to keep the device safe. The case is smooth on the sides and rough on the back, for a good combination of comfort and grip. But the case is open at the top, allowing the pop-up camera to do its work but creating an odd feel when you hold the phone in landscape.The Reno's something of a heavyweight in smartphone terms, tipping the scales at 215 grams (7.58 ounces). For reference, the OnePlus 7 and iPhone XS Max — both large, 6-inch-plus phones, too — are a shade lighter, at 206 grams. The Mi Mix 3, at 218 grams, is the only comparable phone I can think of that's heavier. Fortunately for the Reno, it doesn't have a slider mechanism, which the Mi Mix 3 does have, so the Oppo phone's mass remains well balanced in your hand.Unlike many other top-tier flagships these days, the Reno lacks a curved screen. Initially, I liked being able to easily find the edge of the phone, so I could draw navigational gestures from there, but over time, I did miss the ergonomics of a curved display. The back of the Reno is curved, so the device at least sits nicely in your palm, even if the edges feel surprisingly sharp in comparison to other phones. The display itself is a 6.6-inch OLED panel. Sadly, OnePlus kept its 90-Hz screen technology to itself, so scrolling through web pages and apps on the Reno feels normal rather than beautifully smooth, as it does on the OnePlus 7 Pro.In our testing, the Reno's display managed 171% of the sRGB color gamut, a reasonably high score, but lower than the results from the P30 Pro and OnePlus 7 Pro, which both reached 180%. Oppo's phone also achieved a Delta-E score for color accuracy of 0.16 (lower scores are better), plus an average peak brightness of 416 nits. That's not as bright as the results from either the P30 Pro (444 nits) or the Galaxy S10+ (625 nits). The lab testing backs up my own experience with the Reno. Watching HBO's horrifying but compelling Chernobyl miniseries often had me turning up the screen's brightness so I could spot the grim details hidden within dimly lit scenes. But outdoors or in fully lit rooms, the drama was engrossing on the phone's display, uninterrupted by notch or punch hole.When I watched the vivid, but emotionally wrenching anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, the display did much better. With more color around, the screen gets into its stride and I enjoyed watching the show on the Reno, as much as is possible considering Eva's dour themes.The Reno's cameras are a big deal, so much so that this model is named after its defining feature, a 10x hybrid zoom.The last phone to make a splash with its zoom abilities was the Huawei P30 Pro, which also promised up to a 10x hybrid zoom. However, the P30 Pro has an 8MP telephoto sensor, while the Reno boasts a 13MP sensor, which theoretically allows for greater quality when pushing the phones to the limits of their magnification. The Reno also has a slightly higher max zoom of 60x, as opposed to the 50x the P30 Pro offers. However, I don't recommend taking pictures at these magnifications, since at that point, both phones are using digital zoom only, so the results won't look as good.MORE: Best Smartphone Cameras 2019In a face-off taking pictures of St. Mary's church in central London, I compared the P30 Pro and the Reno at 1x and 10x magnification. At 1x, the ability of the Huawei Super Spectrum sensor to capture extra light compared to other sensors makes for a brighter shot, helping show off the stonework better than the Reno did.But when we crank up the zoom to 10x, it reverses the story. The larger sensor on the Reno's telephoto lens makes that phone's image brighter, with higher resolution than the P30. Considering the near £300 price difference between the two phones, the Reno's better image at 10x zoom is impressive, even if it comes at the expense of the main lens's performance.The OnePlus 7 Pro and the Reno, both part of parent company BBK, have the same Sony IMX586 48MP main camera. So is there any difference between the two? It turns out there is.The Reno's image is once again quite dark, while the 7 Pro's shows off the colors of this tasty apple much more honestly. The image quality is identically excellent, but there are obviously some software-tuning differences between the two manufacturers. This is an easily fixable problem in a photo editor or via an update to the photo app, but the Reno shows a disappointing tendency of failing to make the most of the available light. The final lens on the back of the Rno is the ultrawide 8MP lens, which is a step down from the 7 Pro's 16MP and the P30 Pro's 20MP lenses. In this comparison with the 7 Pro, using a view over Hyde Park's Italian Gardens, we see far better contrast in the 7 Pro's image — for example, in the marks on the lawn in the foreground or the clouds at the back. The Reno's image is surprisingly brighter than the P30's, but the Oppo phone's lower resolution costs it dearly in overall quality.Making the 10x zoom a lead selling point for the Oppo Reno is smart, as this is the most unique part of the phone and works very well indeed. The other two lenses are still competitive, but they're not as good as the top-performing rivals I tested, due to what look to be software instead of hardware problems.Switching to the front camera, the Reno's sensor matches the 7 Pro's 16MP, but again loses to the P30 Pro's 32MP. Comparing the Reno and P30 Pro shows that the Oppo's fin-mounted camera produces a brighter but slightly lower-quality shot than the Huawei's camera, although I can't find major fault with either phone's shooter. The Oppo selfie camera is slightly slower to deploy than the OnePlus 7 Pro's, but this is probably nothing to worry about. The difference between the Oppo's 0.8 seconds and the OnePlus' 0.64 seconds is minute. However, we can't guarantee that 0.16 seconds won't make a difference if some kind of rare butterfly lands on your shoulder and you want to capture the occasion before the visitor flies away.Like the 7 Pro, the Reno's internal gyroscopes will detect if the phone's falling, automatically pulling the camera back in to prevent damage. This is particularly important with the Reno, given how much extra hardware is built in to the pop-up mechanism, as was mentioned above.The Oppo Reno uses Android 9.0 Pie, like all flagship smartphones in 2019 (that aren’t iPhones, of course). Oppo's twist on the theme is the company's ColorOS 6 launcher, which is worth bringing up, because it does a good job of interpreting Google's basic operating system.The icons and text around the phone are all smartly drawn and easy to understand. You can swap between having an app drawer and not having one depending on your preference, and you can choose between two different grid sizes for your pages of apps and between using virtual buttons or gestures for your basic navigation needs.As for more unique features, swiping left on the home screen gets you a series of widgets like OnePlus' OxygenOS, rather than Google News. You can also label your notifications as important or not important, keeping the less interesting ones hidden behind a button tap within the notification drawer, also removing them from the status bar.If you want to keep your apps really safe, you can use the App Lock function to secure them behind a second PIN, which can be different from the one you use to open the phone. It seems unnecessary for me, but perhaps people storing sensitive data or sharing their phones with other people will appreciate this feature.Finally, without even pressing the power button, you can do things with just a swipe using lock-screen gestures. These are handy, but I found that I managed to turn on the flashlight in my pocket by accident multiple times, somehow performing the V motion with my leg while walking. Maybe it's best to keep these settings off, or to unbind the V motion and use the others.All versions of the Reno use the Snapdragon 855, with the max-spec version I reviewed featuring 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space, a model that costs £650. It's not a huge amount of memory, but it's more than enough for the average user. The other, £545 version comes with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage; that model no doubt functions adequately, but it certainly isn't going to top benchmark leaderboards.The 8GB Reno had a multicore score of 11,027 on the Geekbench 4 general-performance benchmark. That's a little lower than the result from the 12GB version of the OnePlus 7 Pro (11,227), but it beats out the showing from the Kirin 980-powered P30 Pro (9,724), which uses the same amount of RAM. The Reno's result is also ahead of the 8GB Galaxy S10's score of 10,813. MORE: Best Gaming Phones 2019While more processing power is desirable, the less-welcome side effect is heat. I used the Reno with the included case during my time with the phone and still found that it became noticeably hot to the touch when I played games like Hitman Sniper or made video calls via Skype. The heat's not uncomfortable, but the gel/graphite/copper cooling-method combination could definitely be more effective. The heat wasn't in vain, at least, as I saw no processing problems while using the Reno under these circumstances.The Dolby Atmos-tuned speaker is low down on the list of features Oppo is promoting for the Reno. But for me, this was one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises of the phone. The sound is not only clear, but also very loud, overpowering the noise of the extractor fan over my kitchen stove while I cooked, something that even my laptop struggles to do. There's no headphone jack available, so you can't add your own old-fashioned, wired headphones. But Oppo provides its own earbuds, with a spare set of gels in case you need something to tide you over until you buy an adaptor or some wireless headphones.The Oppo Reno's optical fingerprint scanner, hidden beneath the display, is pretty reliable and fast enough in comparison with rivals. I never had any trouble using it; the worst performance moments came when it was slow to unlock, but it never completely failed to register, which I've experienced on other phones, like the Huawei P30.There's also a face-unlock feature. This uses only the Reno's selfie camera, rather than a complex array of cameras and other sensors, like Apple's Face ID employs. That means that while the Oppo's unlock feature is convenient, it's not as secure as Apple's. At least Oppo's approach isn't slow, which is always a concern with pop-up camera phones, as the fin deploys rapidly when you want to unlock the phone.You get 4,065 mAh of battery capacity with the Reno. As a result, the battery's life is as long as you'd hope. I was able to take the phone away from an outlet for more than 24 hours In our official test, which consists of browsing the web over LTE data until the phone dies, the Reno's battery lasted 12 hours and 31 minutes. That's far better than the OnePlus 7's time of 9 hours and 31 minutes and just a little behind the 12 hours and 53 minutes the P30 Pro achieved. Once the battery dwindles, the phone charges rapidly with Oppo's 30-watt VOOC charging system. Oppo makes no specific promises about the speed the phone can charge, but my own casual test showed that you can go from empty to 25% in 15 minutes, 50% in just under half an hour and 100% in around 70 minutes. That's plenty fast enough, but it is a little slower than Huawei's 40-watt SuperCharge system, which you get on the P30 Pro. The Reno's showing is almost equal to the OnePlus 7 Pro's charging times, and that's unsurprising, because OnePlus' Warp Charge 30 is based on VOOC.At £700, the Oppo Reno 10x is on the lower end of what you'd pay for a flagship phone, but it still fits comfortably among more-expensive rivals. The Huawei P30 Pro does almost the same thing as the Reno, but until the U.S. government is satisfied that Huawei as a whole doesn't pose a danger to national security, that phone's not going to be an option for most U.S. consumers, and that's not even considering the extra £300/$360 it costs. That said, until Oppo makes an official launch in the U.S., the two phones are nearly equally difficult to buy and equally expensive due to the troubles of importing the international versions.The most widely available rival to the Oppo Reno is the OnePlus 7 Pro. Much of the technology and specs are the same (or can be, depending on which version you buy). In the end, this all comes down to whether you value zoom-lens power and extra battery life over a fancier screen, better standard and wide-angle photography, and the unique features in OnePlus' OxygenOS. I believe the 7 Pro is still a better choice for Android flagship value, but the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom is one of the best phones I've tested this year, balancing its few minor shortfalls with some excellent features."
139,Asus ZenFone 6,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/asus-zenfone-6,review-6478.html","Global sales of smartphones may be slumping, but that's working out pretty well for folks like you and me. Phone makers, desperate to get us to buy their devices, are increasingly cranking out models that offer as many premium features as possible without also driving up the price so high that it turns off would-be customers. Asus' latest flagship phone, the ZenFone 6, fits squarely in this category of aggressively priced premium handsets, and it's one of the best unlocked phones you can buy.The ZenFone 6 is now available to order in the U.S., where you can buy the base model (6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage) for $499. In addition to Asus' store, you can get the phone at Amazon, B&H and Mobile Advance. B&H lets you opt for the 128GB configuration for an extra $100. Asus also makes models with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, though we're not seeing those on sale as of this writing. (A microSD slot lets you expand storage to 2TB on the phone if you're so inclined.)The ZenFone 6 is available unlocked. It only works with GSM-based carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile as well as the many prepaid and discount carriers that use those companies' networks.It's impossible to talk about the ZenFone 6 without first addressing that camera since it influences just about every part of the phone's design. By having a camera serve double-duty for both standard photos and selfies, Asus can offer a full-screen display free of all but the slightest of bezels, with nary a notch or punch hole in sight.But to combine the front and rear camera into a single module that swivels around to wherever it's needed, you give up some spontaneity. To switch the camera from rear to selfie mode, you launch the camera app and tap an on-screen button.It takes a couple of seconds for the camera to pop-up, which may not seem like much, but it’s a delay you don’t have with a more conventional camera setup. (You can also drag the button to move the camera up and down to get the best angle, but that takes even longer — about 5 seconds for the camera to rise up off the back of the phone and snap into place.) None of that will matter for posed self-portraits, but it also means you'll be lucky to capture those ""in the moment"" shots.MORE: Best Smartphones - Here Are the 10 Best Phones AvailableBecause the dual-lens array sits in the middle of the phone, I find that it's exactly where I place my fingers when I'm gaming in landscape view, so I fear that I'll smudge the lenses more than I would with other smartphones.The ZenFone 6 features Corning's Gorilla Glass 6 up front, along with a glass black where you'll find the fingerprint reader just above the Asus logo. (That logo's in an eye-catching blue on the Midnight Black model I tested; you can also get the phone in Twilight Silver.) The glass design gives the ZenFone 6 a heavy feel — it outweighs the 5.9-ounce Pixel 3a XL.The physical buttons for controlling the phone live on the right side of the ZenFone 6. From top to bottom, you get a Smart Key that launches Google Assistant or triggers other shortcuts, the volume rocker and the power button. I'm not a fan of stacking the buttons this way. Perhaps with more time to use the phone, I'd train myself not to hit the Smart Key when I really want to put the phone to sleep, but that day has not yet come.Asus put speakers on the top and bottom of the phone and they handle audio well, though high notes like the guitar riff that opens Creedence Clearwater Revival's Up Around the Bend sound a little distorted. The bigger problem with the speakers is that you run the risk of covering them when playing games in landscape mode, which can muffle the sound on first-person shooters and other action games.Since the company freed up all that screen space by removing a dedicated front camera, it made the most of the extra real estate in the ZenFone 6. The 6.4-inch LCD panel is enormous, and its 92% screen-to-body ratio draws you in to whatever's happening on the screen. When running across the Erangel landscape in PUBG Mobile, I notice detailed scenery that escapes my attention whenever I try out the game on phones with smaller screens.Everything looks sharp on the ZenFone's screen, thanks to the Full HD+ resolution, and bright colors are particularly appealing. Brad Pitt's bright yellow Hawaiian shirt lit up the screen in the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood trailer, The phone even captures some of the hazier colors Quentin Tarantino uses to set the scene in his story of late 60's Hollywood. That said, watching The Ballad of Buster Scruggs on Netflix, I thought the colors looked more muted on my ZenFone than they did when I watched it on my TV, though we'll chalk that up to the difference in screen sizes.Where the ZenFone 6's display struggles is with darker colors and blacks. In the Frozen 2 trailer, Elsa's blue dress was practically lost among the shadows until I cranked the screen's brightness up past 80%. When the lighting darkened in the Tarantino trailer, I also had to strain to make out details. That's the trade-off you make with LCD panels, though, as you give up the truer blacks that OLED technology can offer.The ZenFone 6 captures 161.3% of the sRGB color spectrum, which compares favorably to the 123.4% that the LCD-based iPhone XR re-creates. But phones closer in price to the ZenFone 6 that also happen to feature OLED panels — the Pixel 3a and the Moto Z4 — both fared better in our lab with respective results of 182% and 221%.MORE: Best Camera Phone 2019The colors the ZenFone 6 displays are accurate, though, with the phone getting a Delta-E rating of 0.15. That's better than the iPhone XR (0.28), the Moto Z4 (0.24) and even the Pixel 3a (0.18); numbers closer to 0 are more accurate.At 466 nits of brightness, the ZenFone 6's screen is bright enough. The Pixel 3a, which I find much too dim, topped out at 401 nits on our light meter, while the iPhone XR blew those phones away with a 589-nit reading. I didn't have any trouble seeing the ZenFone 6's screen in bright sunlight, though cranking the display to maximum brightness helped.As unique as the ZenFone 6's Flip Camera may be, it's not going to be much of an innovation if it also doesn't deliver good-looking photos. Fortunately, the ZenFone 6 performed well in our camera testing, with its two lenses producing a number of impressive shots in various circumstances.Whether the camera is tucked into the back of the ZenFone 6 or swiveled out to capture selfies, you get a 48-megapixel main lens with an f/1.79 aperture; that's augmented by a secondary 13-MP wide angle shooter when you want to pull back for more detail. In regular mode, the ZenFone 6 captured a pretty sharp picture of this Victorian-style house popping out of the bushes and standing distinctly against the bright, blue sky in the background.When I switched to the ZenFone 6's wide angle view — it's just a matter of tapping an icon in the phone's camera app — the camera packs in more details. In this case, we see more of the apartment in the foreground, as well as cars parked off to the side of the Victorian. The ZenFone's wide-angle feature works best in landscape shots where there are a lot of details off to the side of the foreground. The more you use the camera, the more comfortable you'll get framing the shot to make the most of that wide-angle lens.To find out how the ZenFone 6's cameras perform against another device in its price range, I grabbed a $479 Pixel 3a XL and took shots with both phones. The 3a XL has just a single rear lens — a 12.2-MP sensor — but it benefits from Google's advances in artificial intelligence and computational photography, so it should pose quite a challenge to the ZenFone 6.There's little separating the two phones in this shot of a pot of flowers inside my house. The Pixel's shot is a little too dark around the rim of the vase for my taste, while the stems in the ZenFone's photo stand out more. But the ZenFone let in too much light on the right side of its shot, which causes a little bit of washing out, especially on that white flower. I think the Pixel 3a's photo is more balanced, but either one would be acceptable.Both phones also struggled with the lighting when I took a shot of my daughter on our front porch. The Pixel 3a XL responded to the bright, sunny day by darkening the photo. The color ends up more balanced throughout, but details like my daughter's blue eyes are more subdued and almost lost in the shadows. Those blue eyes are really visible in the ZenFone 6's photo, but the side of the house is overexposed, while the plants and orange tree in the background are washed out. My daughter's hair color is more accurate in the ZenFone's photo, though.When the lights are low, both the ZenFone 6 and Pixel 3a XL offer shooting modes that produce sharper low-light pictures — Super Night on the ZenFone, Night Sight on the Pixel. Both did a credible job with this shot where my daughter's favorite stuffed animals go clubbing (the club, in this instance, being my backyard lit up with unforgiving red LED lights.)Zoom in on the ZenFone's shot, and you'll see that the stuffies aren't as sharp as the Pixel 3a XL depicts them, and the leaves of the fig tree dipping down into the photo are in better focus in the Pixel's effort. Yet, the ZenFone has a more appealing shot, bringing out more of the color of the lights. The ZenFone 6 does a better overall job here, even if the Pixel 3a XL gets more individual details right.Continuing our tour of challenging light situations, sunlight was streaming in from the windows behind me when my breakfast companion took these shots at a local coffee shop. The backlighting overwhelms the ZenFone 6's shot (there's even a bit of lens flare by my coffee cup), while the Pixel 3a XL compensates by turning up the darks, particularly on the right side of my face.The real story here is how the different camera phones crop portrait shots: the ZenFone 6 likes to include more background details, while the Pixel 3a XL wants the focus on the subject's face. I think I prefer the Pixel 3a XL's approach, primarily because it does a better job with the background blur; the ZenFone 6's background looks less stylized and more out-of-focus. At least, the ZenFone's photo correctly captures the color of my shirt, which looks very grainy in the Pixel's effort.You'd think the ZenFone would dominate all comers when it comes to selfies, since it's using the same 48-megapixel main lens that captures all the other photos you've been taken. The Pixel 3a XL, meanwhile, uses an 8-MP camera for self-portraits. Yet, the Pixel is more up to the task with a bright colorful shot that keeps everything in focus. (I do think the Pixel got a bit overaggressive in smoothing out my face.) The colors are a bit truer-to-life in the ZenFone's effort, but the lighting washes out everything, and things start to get out of focus in the right third of the shot.Like flagship phones from Samsung, LG and OnePlus, the ZenFone 6 uses a class-leading Snapdragon 855 processor. But those phones cost hundreds of dollars more — the OnePlus 7 Pro is the closest to Asus' phone in price at $669. So you should expect comparable performance to these devices at a fraction of the price.And based on my time with the ZenFone 6, that's exactly what you get. We tested the top-of-the line model that comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. But even if you stick with the base model and its 6GB of RAM, you can expect performance in line with the big boys of the Android phone world.On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, our ZenFone model scored 10,290. That's a few places behind the Galaxy S10 Plus (10,732) and LG G8 ThinQ (10,958) and a bit more behind the OnePlus 7 Pro's 11,227 result (though that latter model benefits from a hefty 12GB of memory).The ZenFone 6's performance looks more impressive when you compare it with other sub-$500 phones that run on slower processors to save on cost. The Snapdragon 675-powered Moto Z4 costs the same as the ZenFone 6, but its Geekbench 4 result of 6,506 is well off the pace of the Asus phone. Similarly, the Pixel 3a XL and its Snapdragon 670 chipset turned in a 5,197 score. The ZenFone 6 definitely delivers more bang for the same buck.MORE: 10 Best Android PhonesIn graphics testing, the ZenFone 6 also held its own against pricier competitors. The phone turned in a score of 5,548 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL test — about what we saw from the S10 Plus (5,648) and OnePlus 7 Pro (5,581). Those numbers square with our everyday use of the ZenFone 6, which deftly handled demanding games like PUBG Mobile. I played the game at its highest graphic settings and rarely saw any stutters or hiccups — certainly nothing that affected gameplay. (The phone does get noticeably warm when you're taxing its processor, especially around the camera module.)I could jump between apps without any hesitation on the ZenFone 6, and found the phone to be responsive to my taps and swipes. The ZenFone 6 has more than enough power to handle the things most smartphone users will throw at it, and it has enough in the tank to take on demanding apps, too.Asus did not skimp on battery size with the ZenFone 6, opting for a 5,000 mAh power pack. For context, the ZenFone 5Z offered a 3,300 mAh battery, which now seems both quaint and paltry.You certainly get the sense that the ZenFone 6 is not going to need to be charged that offen. One night, with the phone's battery indicator at 65%, I forgot to plug in the ZenFone 6 to charge overnight. The next morning, the indicator had trickled down to 60%. On another occasion, after a two-hour testing session that featured app downloads, gaming and watching trailers on YouTube, the battery indicator dipped from 85% to 65%, and that's after I slipped the phone in my pocket for a while without putting the screen to sleep. (I told you that Smart Key button was a nuisance.)The ZenFone 6 also excelled at the Tom's Guide battery test, in which we have the phone continuously surf the web over T-Mobile's LTE network with the screen set to 150 nits of brightness. The ZenFone finished at 15 hours and 1 minute, a staggering result for any phone, even one with that big of a battery. This puts the ZenFone 6 on our list of phones with the longest battery life.MORE: Best Battery App - Battery Saving Apps for iPhone, AndroidOnly two other phones of recent vintage topped 15 hours on our battery test — the Moto G7 Power (15:35), which also benefits from a ridiculously size 5,000 mAh battery, and the Cat S41 (15:19), an older model aimed at the contractor crowd.A bigger battery is going to take longer to charge, but Asus speeds the process a little with support for 18-watt QuickCharge 4.0 technology. I plugged in the ZenFone 6 when its battery was all but drained — the indicator showed 1% remaining, but it was running on fumes at that point. After 15 minutes of charging, the indicator was up to 17%. Running that same experiment on the Pixel 3a XL, another phone with an 18W charger, I got the phone's battery indicator to 22% after 15 minutes, though the Pixel 3a XL's smaller 3,700 mAh battery doesn't take as much to refill.  The ZenUI has never been a strong suit of the Asus phone experience, but the latest iteration takes some steps in the right direction. Don't expect the pure Android experience you get from phones that take a lighter approach with tweaking Android's interface, but you'll find less bloatware and a more straightforward Settings app on the ZenFone 6.The phone ships with Android 9 Pie, and you can expect an Android Q update later. (The phone can run the Q beta right now, if you're daring.) Asus is promising an upgrade path to 2020's Android R, which is a long time to support a sub-$500 phone.The performance and battery life offered by the ZenFone 6 are enough to earn it a space on our list of  best Android phones available today. Those factors would be impressive enough on their own, but when you consider you're paying a couple hundred dollars less than higher-profile Android phones but getting comparable performance and a longer-lasting device, it really reflects well on the ZenFone.There are trade-offs for that lower price. I've seen better-looking displays, and as innovative as the camera design is on the ZenFone 6, you'll get better shots from the Pixel 3a XL. That said, the photos produced by the ZenFone 6 aren't too far off the pace set by leading camera phones, and if you don't mind waiting for that camera array to snap into place, this is a pretty solid phone to turn to for your mobile photo needs.Credit: Tom's Guide"
140,Nokia 4.2,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/nokia-4-2,"How cheap does a smartphone need to be to qualify for the budget tier? That question has gotten harder and harder to answer in recent years, as handset prices have continually risen.Fortunately, HMD Global isn't blindly following trends with its introduction of the 5.7-inch Nokia 4.2. At $189, I'd venture a guess and say it's below most people's threshold of what constitutes cheap — especially as some low-cost rivals, like Moto's G7 series, have crossed the $300 barrier.And yet, for how little you're paying for the Nokia 4.1, you still get minimal bezels; dual cameras at the rear packed with special effects to add a bit of pop to photos; a reasonably priced, 3,000-mAh battery; and pure, up-to-date Android One software, as Google intended.The Nokia 4.2 is a respectable, cheap phone — nothing more, nothing less. And although you could certainly find something better if you spent $50 to $100 more, for less than $200, right now there isn't anything that comes close.MORE: Best Cheap Phones 2019: Top Android Picks Under $300The Nokia 4.2 costs $189, comes in two colors — Black and Pink Sand — and is sold unlocked in the United States at Best Buy, B&H and Amazon. The phone supports only GSM carriers, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile and Cricket Wireless. CDMA-based networks, like the ones at Sprint and Verizon, won't support the Nokia 4.2.In the United Kingdom, the Nokia 4.2 goes for £149, and is sold by Amazon. In both the U.S. and U.K., the device comes equipped with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage, with the option to expand that by up to 400GB with a microSD card.""The Nokia 4.2 demonstrates a clever way to use plastics and cheaper materials to lend a premium, thoughtful fit and finish.""Notched displays are hardly uncommon in the mobile world these days. But a notched display in a sub-$200 phone? That's still a rarity.While I'm not the biggest fan of notches, the Nokia 4.2's certainly makes the device looks like it costs several hundreds of dollars more than it actually does. So, in that respect, you could say the design achieves its intended purpose. The bezels are quite slim on the top and sides, though since this is a $189 handset after all, the chunkier bottom lip isn't particularly surprising or offensive.The Nokia 4.2 joins the slabs of glass on the front and rear with a glossy polycarbonate frame. The rounded rectangular footprint and curved edges are very evocative of the iPhone XS; in fact, the 4.2 is roughly the same size and shape as the XS, just slightly taller and a hair thicker, allowing it to accommodate a headphone jack.On the back of the Nokia 4.2, you'll find a capacitive fingerprint sensor stashed below vertically stacked dual-lens cameras. It would have been nice if the scanner were a bit more prominently recessed, because it can be difficult to locate just feeling around for it, but this is mostly a nitpick; it gets the job done.Undoubtedly, the 4.2's most distinctive feature is its illuminated power button. When you receive a notification, the outer edge of the key breathes softly white. It's a very nice touch that's reminiscent of the Android notification LEDs of old. And if you don't like the feature, you can always turn it off.If I had one serious gripe about the Nokia 4.2 from a usability standpoint, it would have to be HMD's decision to opt for micro USB over USB Type-C ports. It's not uncommon to see micro USB in superlow-priced handsets, but perhaps it's a testament to HMD's design and build quality that it really feels like it doesn't belong on the 4.2. Micro USB accessories are fading into obscurity, and even if it meant trading the notch or cutting costs elsewhere, I think I'd rather have the wider compatibility and speedier charging that comes with the new connector.Our review unit came in Black, and while the phone looks fine enough that way, I fell in love with the Pink Sand colorway when I first saw the 4.2 earlier this year. The hue itself is lovely, but I also really dig the powdered matte finish over the frame, which is a really clever way to use plastics and cheaper materials to lend a premium, thoughtful fit and finish. Given the choice, it's the flavor I'd rather have for sureThe 5.7-inch, 1520 x 720 LCD panel in the Nokia 4.2 doesn't get particularly bright, produce tantalizing colors or feature especially crisp pixel density. But, for $189, it'll do.After being exposed to so many QHD OLED panels with extra-wide color gamut support and HDR, I have to say that I wasn't blown away watching the trailer for the upcoming Ford v Ferrari film on the 4.2's screen.Witnessing driver Ken Miles, portrayed by Christian Bale, trail a pack of Corvettes at California's Willow Springs raceway in his AC 289 wasn't quite as breathtaking as it should've been — the colors weren't very vivid, and the image just wasn't clear enough.Still, this isn't a bad display — just an unremarkable and cheap one. With a peak full-screen brightness of 348 nits, the 4.2 falls well below our 488-nit category average for smartphones, let alone the $249 Moto G7 Power's score (558 nits). Color accuracy is strong, with a Delta-E rating of 0.28 compared with the Motorola's 0.35. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)If you favor bright, bold colors, the 4.2's sRGB coverage of 95% simply won't cut it. The wide majority of phones routinely trump 100% — our average happens to be 161% — and HMD doesn't provide any options for a more saturated color profile, so you're pretty much stuck with what you see out of the box.The Nokia 4.2's 13-megapixel, ƒ/2.2 aperture lens does most of the heavy lifting with respect to photography, though there's also a secondary 2-MP sensor playing sidekick, providing the stereoscopic vision that allows the device to capture depth. On the front, there's an 8-MP, ƒ/2.0 camera for selfies.Nokia's budget imaging hardware is typically fine enough for what you're paying, as HMD eschews gimmicky features and overprocessed scenes in favor of realistic, what-you-see-is-what-you-get colors. However, the 4.2's cameras don't even impress on that basic level.Take, for example, this scene captured on a dreary day following a rain shower in New York City's Bryant Park. The 4.2 delivers a shot that could use a great deal of sharpening compared with what the Moto G7 Power captured. There's also a slight green cast pervading everything, and the highlights pouring through the canopy of trees in the sky are almost blinding. The G7 Power's take is far from perfect, either, though it navigates the challenging scene far better.Looking out to the street from inside the dim entrance of a building, both phones again clearly struggle with highlights; the asphalt and sidewalk appear white hot. Meanwhile, inside, the 4.2 renders the brick and marble with a bit more brightness than the G7 Power could muster. Again, the Nokia-branded handset could use a splash of color and crisper details overall, though I have to admit I was a little surprised with the 4.2's ability to paint in the shadows.My colleague Jorge appeared equally blurry through the lenses of both devices, but the Nokia was downright fussy and difficult to work with here. The 4.2 features a dedicated Bokeh mode to make use of those dual cameras, yet its autofocus is remarkably stubborn. I had to ask Jorge to stand still for about a good 20 seconds when attempting to capture a serviceable shot with HMD's phone: The feed from the viewfinder repeatedly cycled in and out of focus, the camera app begged for more light (even though I was in an already well-lit room) and the depth effect took what felt like ages to process on the 4.2's under-equipped silicon.Once I was able to come away with a workable portrait — and Jorge was mercifully permitted to move again — there still remained a ring of focus around the subject's head, and the camera failed to distinctly separate the foreground and background.At least I was much more pleased with the selfie I took using the 4.2's front-facing camera. The colors were noticeably more natural than they were using the G7 Power, and everything seemed a bit more in focus as well. There was still a tinge of blurriness with regard to my skin tone and beard, but the Nokia phone's selfie is definitely the one I'd share first — but only if I were forced to share one of them at all.The Snapdragon 439 system-on-chip inside the Nokia 4.2 integrates four performance cores with another four tuned for efficiency. Coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage before adding a microSD card, the 4.2 would appear to provide decent enough power for the price, at least on paper — though it isn't difficult to tax that CPU.MORE: Best Android Games 2019I discovered as much when the 4.2 got a little toasty under the stress of certain apps and games. While browsing Chrome, thumbing around Google Maps and generally using Android was thankfully hiccup-free, Facebook chugged at times, especially while scrolling. F1 Mobile Racing maxed out at quite a low frame rate, which hampered my ability to navigate Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve without triggering many massive accidents. PUBG Mobile proved a bit more consistent, though the initial parachute drop was fraught with frame skips.""The Nokia 4.2 often got a little toasty under the stress of certain apps and games.""If you're accustomed to more premium hardware, you'll quickly notice everything takes a hair longer on the Nokia 4.2, especially opening apps. The power deficit also presents itself in unique ways, like how the system omits certain animations — like swiping away notifications — to promote the illusion of responsiveness. The thing is, though, it's hard to do much better for the price.The Moto G7 Power is appreciably sprightlier than Nokia's 4.2, with its Snapdragon 632 silicon yielding a Geekbench 4 score of 4,485, compared with the 4.2's 3,373. Then again, the G7 Power costs $60 more. A better point of comparison could be last year's Moto G6, which may be a year old but still managed to outpace the 4.2 by about 600 points, thanks to a slightly snappier Snapdragon 450 chipset. Better yet, the G6 now costs about as much as Nokia's newer offering.The 4.2 is a bit closer to Motorola's handsets where graphics performance is concerned. In 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test, which measures the polygon-crunching capabilities of low-end phones, the 4.2 notched a score of 13,490 — some 1,400 points behind the Moto G7 Power. It's far from the best result we've seen, though again, for the price, what can you say?The Nokia 4.2 and its 3,000-mAh battery delivered 9 hours and 12 minutes in Tom's Guide's Battery Test, which tasked the device with endlessly streaming webpages over T-Mobile's LTE network at a brightness of 150 nits. That's exactly 1 hour less than the average for smartphones.For reference, the Moto G7 Power, with its massive 5,000-mAh pack, notched more than 15 and a half hours in the same test. The Moto G6 fared a bit better than the 4.2, at 9:25, while the $269 Nokia 6.1 — one of HMD's midrange offerings from last year — slotted in at 10:24.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThe battery life is passable, but the decision to fit a micro USB port to the 4.2 is particularly annoying when it's time to recharge. Typically, I bring a 60-watt Chrome-branded USB Type-C charger with me on trips — it can push enough juice to charge my MacBook Pro and Nintendo Switch, and even allows my Pixel 3 to top up via 18-watt USB Power Delivery fast charging. But during my excursions with the Nokia 4.2, I had to remember to carry a separate micro USB cable and adapter at all times. It was an annoyance I haven't had to deal with in quite some time.As with all of Nokia's recent phones, the 4.2 touts Android One software for an experience similar to what you get in Google's Pixel line. There are some light customizations in effect here, with HMD providing its own Nokia-branded camera; FM tuner; and phone management and support apps; but otherwise, this is pure Android 9 Pie, through and through.As such, it's hard to find fault with the software in place here. Android One implementation means the 4.2 will see Android Q either late this year or early next. The potential for future updates is unclear, though HMD has a respectable track record with regard to keeping its handsets up to date. If any sub-$200 handset is going to get regular security and bug patches, the 4.2 stands a better chance than the rest of them.It's hard recommending a phone for less than $200, and the Nokia 4.2 demonstrates exactly why. HMD typically produces remarkably inexpensive phones that offer excellent bang for their buck, but I fear the 4.2 is simply too cheap to even get the basics right.Absolutely nothing about this handset, save for its design, is particularly noteworthy. The performance is middling, the battery life is so-so and the cameras will never impress you. That's not to say the phone is downright bad in any of those respects, but rather that you are simply getting what you pay for.Unfortunately, our recommendation is that you should simply pay more, if you can. The G7 Power goes for $250 and blows the 4.2 away with regard to battery life; its user experience is also much more consistent and the software is comparable to Nokia's implementation of Android One. Moto's older G6 is a solid option if you find the price tag on Nokia's 4.2 appealing, and last year's Nokia 6.1 might have a markedly less modern-looking design, but it's much more capable where it counts and will probably last you a few years longer, too.The Nokia 4.2 offers a pretty face, though it'll age far less gracefully once its flaws start to surface."
141,Huawei P30,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/huawei-p30,"Budget versions of top-end smartphones are now a critical part of the smartphone market. For every iPhone XS or Galaxy S10, we get an iPhone XR or S10e that trades some features for a more affordable price.Enter the Huawei P30, a slightly stripped-back version of the excellent P30 Pro. The P30 loses few of the headlining pieces of tech found in the Pro model in exchange for a £/$200 or so price cut. Many of the good things about the P30 Pro are still present on the P30, making it easy to recommend the lower-cost model. If you can control your feelings of jealousy toward P30 Pro owners, you'll likely be pleased to have the Huawei P30 in your pocket.In the U.K., you can buy the P30 from a few places, including Carphone Warehouse, EE, Three and O2. But the best deal is from Amazon UK, which sells the model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage that I tested for this review for £599. That’s £100 less than the P30's list price. There's a choice of four colors, too — Black, Amber Sunrise, Aurora (pictured in this review) and Breathing Crystal.In the U.S., you can get the Huawei P30 from a domestic retailer — B&H Photo — which is a rarity of Huawei phones. B&H is selling the 6GB/128GB in Black, Aurora or Breathing Crystal, for $599. B&H sells the Latin American version of the P30, meaning that while the phone will work on most GSM-based carriers (e.g.. AT&T or T-Mobile), it's worth checking to see if the SIM you want to use is compatible with the bands on offer.You'd think the P30 and P30 Pro would have similar designs, but the difference between the two models is surprisingly significant. The P30 doesn't offer the Pro's curved-glass surfaces so the most notable thing about its front is a water-drop notch, making for an uninspiring first impression.Fortunately, it's more of a party around the back. Three of the four available colors come with pearlescent effects that give the P30 a more dynamic feeling even when you leave it on a table. The phone's compact but intriguing triple-camera array, arranged vertically in the top left corner, also looks impressive.Beyond pure looks, though, there's nothing wrong with the P30's design. The P30 is a little smaller than the P30 Pro, but not by much, with a 6.1-inch screen instead of a 6.47-inch one. It's a pleasantly light device to hold. too. At 165 grams (5.8 ounces), the P30 is around 30 grams, or 1 ounce, lighter than an iPhone XR despite having a slightly larger screen. That, combined with its more compact frame, makes the P30 very comfortable to hold.The 6.1-inch OLED screen on the P30 with Full HD+ resolution isn't a revolution in display tech, but it's still very good. Catching up on the newest series of the British police drama Line of Duty was an enjoyable experience with this phone, as the screen ably displayed both the outdoor night scenes and the starkly lit interrogation room. It's just as good with brighter shows, too, with Tuca and Bertie popping off the P30 screen with lively colors and strange imagery like a bowl of oddly shaped jelly beans.The P30 features a fingerprint sensor underneath that display, and the P30 can be very picky about how it wants you to press your thumb onto the phone. In my first days using the phone, I rarely got it to unlock on my first try, and ended up locking myself out more than once (albeit just for a minute at a time). These troubles leveled out once I’d used the P30 for a longer period, but this isn't an issue I've had with other in-screen sensors. The P30 also offers a face-detection option to either unlock your phone outright or let you see lock-screen notifications you've set to stay hidden.Just as the P30 Pro uses only its bottom speaker for playing audio out loud, so does the P30, even though it uses a normal call speaker instead of the sub-display speaker on the Pro. The speaker is perfectly functional, but at this price, you’d hope for something a little better.The P30 can produce sound at a decent volume, but as I found when listening to some Spotify playlists of chilled-out jazz one Sunday afternoon, the quality isn't the best. The speaker lacks depth in the bass and puts unwarranted focus on the percussion. This is probably the weakest part of the phone, which is a great pity because nothing else on the phone is below par.Fortunately, you get the options of USB-C, Bluetooth or 3.5mm headphone jack (the jack not being present on the P30 Pro) to link your personal audio products. There's a pair of USB-C headphones in the box, too, should you need them, but you're better off using your own kit.Even though the P30 lacks a ""Pro"" in its name, it's important to stress that the cameras you get with this model are still very effective. You get the same 40-MP ""super-spectrum"" sensor found on the P30 Pro, which uses a RYYB sensor instead of an RGGB one to capture more light in your photographs, and an identical 32-MP front camera. too.The P30 includes ultrawide and telephoto lenses on its back, too, but they aren't the same as the P30 Pro's. The zoom is capable of 3x optical, 5x hybrid lossless zoom and 30x maximum zoom, instead of 5x optical, 10x hybrid lossless and 50x maximum. The wide lens also has a less powerful sensor (16MP instead of 20MP), but it is otherwise the same as the one on the Pro.The only thing you miss out on with the P30 is the Pro's time-of-flight (TOF) sensor. It means any bokeh portrait shots you take won't be quite as good, but comparing shots taken by the two phones shows there isn't too much of a difference.The hypersensitive sensor on the P30 makes images much brighter than our comparison smartphone, a Google Pixel 3, when the sky is cloudy. In these images, in London's Hyde Park, the P30 helps keep as much light in your pictures as possible. The green of the lawns looks far more inviting on the Huawei than on the Pixel 3, as does the brighter water and stonework of the Italian Gardens Fountain and the view over the Long Water.When it's brighter out, you can lose some of the color through overexposure with the P30. Sometimes it can make an already pretty scene look even more appealing, such as these shots taken at Trafalgar Square.However, as the picture of coffee and a brownie square show us, sometimes you can make things look worse when increasing brightness, making an appetizing afternoon treat look uninviting on the P30 while looking delicious on the Pixel 3.There's a Pro Mode in the Camera app on the P30 that will let you have more control over the settings, but if you're just taking casual snapshots like these, that extra light can prove to be a hindrance.MORE: Best Camera Phone 2019Zooming in on the two statues of Admiral Nelson and King Charles I is easy enough on both the P30 and the Pixel 3, although the Huawei could happily keep going far beyond the 3x setting I used. The P30 manages to capture the sculptures' detail both on the well-lit and darker areas. The Pixel 3, in comparison, does better with the shadowy parts, but makes the lighter sections too bright.The 32MP selfie camera of the P30 produces a lovely image, but the post-processing makes it feel a little cold. It's probably a more honest portrayal of my face than what the Pixel 3 would capture, but I prefer the Google phone's warmer tone.Overall, the P30 is a great camera phone with the misfortune to be perpetually compared to an exceptional one, the P30 Pro. You won't be shooting class-leading long-distance or wide-angle photography, but the times you are really going to miss the Pro’s extra versatility are quite rare.Like the P30 Pro, the P30 runs on the Kirin 980 processor, aided by 6GB RAM, although there is an 8GB version in some markets. The 6GB version I had didn't lack power, as the memory and octa-core chip propelled me through my daily tasks with smooth speed. Using the Geekbench 4 benchmarking tool, the P30 managed a CPU multicore score of 9,728. This is 4 points more than the P30 Pro we tested managed, which is likely due to small differences between individual processors. It's still behind the Galaxy S10e's 10,513 or the iPhone XR’s 11,312, but chances are you're not going to notice the difference.MORE: The Best Phones for GamingTrying out Hitman Sniper caused the phone to warm up slightly at the top, where I assume the Kirin chip is located. But it’s barely noticeable, and the output is responsive and smooth. Fortnite definitely caused more heat as I played through a round, but the phone was still a comfortable temperature to hold throughout the (short) time I was attempting to become the last man standing. And the P30 again showed no sign of trouble dealing with the game's performance demands.The 3,650mAh cell within the P30 is, unsurprisingly, not as good as the P30 Pro's, which has a 4,200mAh capacity and is one of the longest-lasting smartphones we've tested. However, with an estimated talk time of 28 hours, that's still plenty of time to use the phone.My own use can back this up: I regularly returned home after a full day at work and a social engagement in the evening to find that the P30 was still over 40% full, even after a day of numerous social media checks and multimedia playback. If you were a little more careful with your power consumption, you could easily go two days without charging the P30.MORE: Best Phone Battery Life - Longest Lasting SmartphonesThe P30’s battery fills up quickly, too. Huawei's 40W Super Charge system means you can easily fill the battery in under an hour, or up to 66% with 30 minutes of charging. There's no wireless charging option for those of you seeking to embrace the cableless future, but with the excellent charging speeds and power consumption, it's hard to hold that against the P30.Huawei's take on the Android 9.0 Pie base is all right. There are as many bloatware apps as you'd find on a Samsung phone, but Huawei's apps seem to bother you slightly more with notifications. It's easily fixable in the options menu if you lack the patience to swipe them away.Other than this, you've got all the Android functions you'd want, including an option to enable an app drawer, which is a welcome sight. There are a few special abilities, such as Huawei Share, which lets you easily send files back and forth between your compatible Huawei devices. And if you have a pair of Huawei's FreeLace earphones, you'll be able to use the features locked off from other users, such as quick plug-in pairing.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowYou have the option to control the phone either with virtual buttons or swiping gestures, both of which work just fine, as well as some more advanced gestures requiring you to tap on the screen with your knuckles. One unique feature is the navigation dock. This adds a movable virtual controller to the screen, which allows you to perform the controls bound to the edge of screen swipes by using it as a sort of button/joystick hybrid. I didn't take to this method of control, but I can see the benefit of it if your hands are small or you have mobility issues that would make either of the main options difficult to use.The gap between the P30 and P30 Pro looks more significant on paper than it is in reality. If, as it is for most of us, the price is a consideration for your new smartphone, then be assured that where it counts, the P30 is all-around just as good without having the ""Pro"" label attached. You won't miss the extra zoom power and ToF sensor unless you're a massive photo enthusiast. The P30's performance is almost identical to the P30 Pro, and the smaller frame might even be preferable to some users.The P30 suffers by being a difficult phone to get a hold of in the U.S., and you can get better sound and user interfaces elsewhere. But the balance of performance and cost is near-spot on, making the Huawei P30 a great value for a low-tier premium smartphone."
142,Sony Xperia 1,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/sony-xperia-1,"Sony is always marching to the beat of its own drum. When other companies were exploring giant edge-to-edge displays, Sony went smaller with last year's adorable XZ2 Compact. Now that bezels are a thing of the past, other device makers are turning to foldable phones to lure buyers. Sony isn't playing that game.Instead, the company is going after film buffs with a trio of phones that promise cinematic experiences thanks to ultrawide, 21:9 displays.The midrange Xperia 10 ($349) and 10 Plus ($429), released earlier this year, underwhelmed us with terrible performance and finicky cameras. At $950, the Xperia 1 costs more than double the price of its siblings, and places Sony's latest in the middle of an  extremely competitive fight, where it's going to have to battle everything from the Galaxy S10+ to the iPhone XS.It's a fight Sony will have a hard time winning — the Xperia 1 is a little too weird for most people.Sony's $950 Xperia 1 is available to buy now through Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo and Focus Camera.Like the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus, Sony's new flagship is compatible with GSM networks and certified to work on Verizon. Sprint customers are out of luck.In the U.S., the Xperia 1 comes in black and purple.There's no getting around it: this phone is strangely shaped. It looks more like my TV remote than it does a smartphone. Samsung’s Galaxy S10+ has a similarly ginormous display, just a hair under the Xperia 1 at 6.4 inches, and measures 6.2 inches long. I thought that was huge, until I tried sticking the Xperia 1 in my jeans pocket. I couldn't sit down without this thing stabbing me in the leg.The Xperia 1 doesn't necessarily look bad — just a little bizarre. Size-wise, the Xperia 1 stands out of a smartphone lineup, but the black model I tested was run-of-the-mill regarding color. It is definitely sleek, if not unique. The phone's glossy back was also mostly resistant to fingerprints, which is a relief in this day and age. The device is slippery, though — a problem that plagues most smartphones.For a phone that's all about doing big-screen entertainment justice on a smaller screen, I'm puzzled that Sony didn't include a headphone jack in the Xperia 1. I normally don't think about it, because I own a couple pairs of Bluetooth earbuds and headphones, but this would be the phone that would lend itself to a 3.5mm audio jack.Then there's the button placement — Sony put everything you need to operate the device on its right side. The volume rocker, fingerprint sensor, power button and camera launcher line the right of the phone's frame, and I often found myself inadvertently pressing something just by picking the phone up from a table or plucking it out of my bag.With the Xperia 1, Sony claims to offer the world's first 4K HDR OLED display. And it's gorgeous.The 6.5-inch display's 21:9 aspect ratio makes this phone feel like you're holding a movie theater in the palm of your hand. I opened Netflix and decided to test the CinemaWide screen with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse to see how the stunningly saturated animation would play on a smartphone panel. Sony says it automatically enables a color-enhanced Creator mode when you open Netflix, and whatever magic is happening behind the scenes creates a movie-watching experience unlike any other I've seen on a smartphone. I was blown away.The OLED panel's accurate reproduction of hues is impressive. As I watched Spider-Man, the comic-book yellow speech bubbles popped around Miles Morales as he strolled through his high school's Tiffany-blue hallways. The Xperia 1's panel notched a Delta-E score of 0.16 for color accuracy. To compare, Samsung's Galaxy S10+ notched a 0.29 and the iPhone XS Max hit 0.22 on the Delta-E rating. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) The Xperia 1 also covers 143.4% of the sRGB color gamut, more than its slightly pricier (and slightly smaller) rivals, the Galaxy S10+ (136.5%) and the iPhone XS Max (123%).The 21:9 aspect ratio makes the Xperia 1 feel like you’re holding a movie theater in the palm of your hand.Gaming is also a delight. I played my favorite street-racing game, Asphalt 9, and gripped the extra-long Xperia 1 like it was a steering wheel as I sped through the streets of European capitals. As I kicked it into Nitro gear, Parisian architecture flashed by, and I never appreciated the Xperia 1's high-res ultrawide screen more.The screen is less awesome when watching YouTube videos and reading articles. As I watched Beyonce's ""Spirit"" video for The Lion King, I stretched the video to 21:9 and the glorious blur of color and dancing became fuzzy. But without stretching the video, giant black bands appear on both sides of the action. It's distracting.MORE: Apple's iPhone XS Max Has the Best Smartphone Display EverI also expected reading to be a pleasant experience on the Xperia 1 because its ultralong display can fit in more text, but I've become accustomed to reading on squares. I find that physical books, Kindles and more normal-shaped smartphones are more comfortable for taking in blocks of text than this elongated screen.Your mileage may vary. The Xperia's display is easy to see in bright sunlight, reaching 555 nits in our lab when hit with a light meter. That's not as bright as the Galaxy S10+ (625 nits) or the iPhone XS Max (606 nits), but it wasn't noticeable to my eye.Sony took the camera technology from its Alpha camera lineup and baked it into the Xperia 1, so I was excited to test out its triple-lens array. With a new BIONZ X image processor and three 12-megapixel cameras — a standard, wide-angle and telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom — I expected high-quality photos.And I got them — some of the time. For instance, in a photo of the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas taken from across the Strip, the Xperia's ultrawide aspect ratio offers more scenery in the frame than a more traditional size phone would. The Xperia also handled the streetlights better than the Galaxy S10+, which has a triple-lens camera system of its own (and in this case did not have Bright Night mode activated).But in other situations, like a backlit selfie and a photo of almond butter toast in a dimly lit cafe, the Xperia struggled to optimize the lighting.The Galaxy S10+ selfie looks more natural; the Xperia's image appears hazy and the sunlight on my shoulders is blown out.The Xperia couldn't handle the low light in the coffee shop, highlighting the plate instead of the strawberry jam atop the almond butter. The Galaxy S10+ calibrated the light perfectly.Lighting issues aside, I just didn't love the experience of using the camera. The Xperia 1 takes longer than most smartphones to capture a photo after tapping the shutter. The process of toggling between lenses isn't exactly intuitive, either. Unlike the Galaxy S10+, which lines up its lens options in preview so you know which one you're using, the Xperia makes you guess as you tap through the choices: 1X, 2X or W? (Those are standard, telephoto and wide-angle, but good luck figuring that out on first glance.)MORE: Which Camera Phone Has the Best Zoom?Nearly every flagship phone will soon have a triple-lens camera, so Sony is at the forefront there. But Samsung still has the trio to beat.With Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 855 chip and 6GB of RAM, the Xperia 1 turns in a performance you'd expect from a flagship Android phone in 2019 — and then some.The Xperia 1 notched a 11,147 on Geekbench 4's test of overall system performance, nipping at the heels of the OnePlus 7 Pro (11,227) and the iPhone XS (11,420). The Galaxy S10+ (10,732) is no slouch, but the Xperia 1 edges out Samsung's flagship.In everyday life, this just means that Sony's flagship can easily handle all of your usual activities: streaming movies on Netflix, cruising the internet and playing (accidentally) way too many races in Asphalt 9. MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe Xperia also pulled ahead of the S10+ in graphics performance, scoring 5,729 on 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme Open GL ES 3.1 test. Samsung's supersize flagship hit 5,648. The Xperia 1 also sailed past the iPhone XS, which scored 4,339.With all the movies you’re going to watch on the Xperia 1, it's disappointing that Sony didn't stuff a larger battery into its extra-large frame. The flagship's 3,330 mAh pack lasted just 9 hours and 21 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile’s LTE network with the display set to 150 nits.With all the movies you're going to watch on the Xperia 1, it's disappointing that Sony didn't stuff a larger battery into the phone's extra-large frame.That's slightly better than Sony's other 2019 handsets, the Xperia 10 (8:05) and 10 Plus (8:46). Those devices have smaller batteries, so it makes sense that they don't last as long as the beefier Xperia 1.But buyers prioritize battery life, especially in an expensive phone designed to consume (and create) videos. The average smartphone lasts nearly 10 hours on our test, and flagships such as the Galaxy S10+ (12:35) and iPhone XS Max (10:38) easily surpass the Xperia 1.MORE: Best Phone Battery Life - Longest Lasting Smartphone BatteriesThe good news is that the Xperia doesn't take long to charge, juicing up to 40 percent in 30 minutes. That's not super-impressive compared with the likes of the OnePlus 7 Pro, which uses Warp Charge technology to go from 0 to 60% in a half hour, but it's not terrible.The Xperia 1 has a near-perfect display, but its size makes the phone feel (and look) bizarre. If the company ditched the thick bezels around the camera and chin of the device, it could maintain that super-wide aspect ratio while looking more modern.But when other smartphone makers zig, Sony zags. I appreciate the effort; I just wish the company would deliver on its promise. Cutting-edge camera tech? The photos need to be perfect. Crazy amazing screen? Size it appropriately for a human hand to hold. And if you want people watching Netflix on the regular, the phone's battery life has to be much longer.I wanted to like the Xperia 1. But it's just too expensive for what you get. If you're going to spend $1,000, the Galaxy S10+ is still the Android flagship to beat."
143,Palm,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/palm-phone,review-6043.html","Palm heard that you were worried that you've been staring at your smartphone screen too much lately. So, to help you use your phone less, Palm went ahead and built you a second, smaller phone to carry around.It sounds silly when put that way, but there's actually a decent idea at work here. There are times when you want to be in the moment, free from your smartphone's digital grip, but you still need a way to make phone calls, get urgent messages and send emails when absolutely necessary. Why not leave your main smartphone at home in favor of a secondary device that can do all those things, while remaining small and slender enough to stay out of sight and, hopefully, out of mind?Give the makers of the new Palm credit: They've certainly created a device that's compact enough to fit neatly into a pocket and never appear again until you really need to use your phone. Unfortunately, this Palm packs enough frustrations that when you do pull the phone out of your pocket, you're likely to regret it.  Updated June 18 at 9:24 a.m. ET: Palm is now offering its phone unlocked as a stand-alone device that can be used on AT&T and Verizon. We've updated the availability section accordingly.Palm phone price and availabilityDon't confuse this $350 Palm with the PDA that lorded it over the mobile-device landscape 20 years ago. The creators of this Palm bought the rights to that product's name, which they're now using on this companion phone.When it launched, you couldn't use the Palm as a stand-alone smartphone. It was available exclusively through Verizon. Early adopters had to add a data plan that would allow their Palm to share a line with their regular phone — an unlimited plan for the Palm adds on $10 a month to your Verizon bill. (Note that the plan isn't *that* unlimited: Use more than 15GB of data and Verizon reserves the right to slow your data speed.)A few months later, Palm relaunched the device as a phone that could be used entirely on its own. And now, the company is offering an unlocked version for the same price as the original — $350 — that is designed to work on AT&T and T-Mobile as well. Those who want to use the Palm as a second device on Verizon are still free to do so.  I tested the Palm with a Pixel 3 XL, available for $929. Tack on $300 for a Palm under a two-year contract, and you're looking at more than $1,200 in hardware costs alone, just for the luxury of untethering yourself from a full-sized phone.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesYou can use the Palm as a companion to either Android or iOS devices, but iPhone users should be warned that iMessages won't appear on your Palm, which runs Android 8.1. If you want messages to move seamlessly between your iPhone and your Palm, you've got to turn to Verizon's Message+ app.Design: Let's get smallIf you've ever wanted to know what André the Giant felt while gripping normal-sized objects with his massive paw, pick up a Palm. I don't exactly have the largest hands in the world, but I can practically enclose my entire fist around the 3.8 x 2 x 0.29-inch phone. At 2.2 ounces, the Palm rested undetected in my coat pocket, which is exactly what its designers had in mind.Don't confuse those tiny dimensions with a device that's delicate, though. The Palm uses Gorilla Glass 3 on its front and back, and the midframe is made out of billet aluminum. With an IP68 dust- and water-resistant rating, you can drop your Palm in a little less than 5 feet of water without any worry. And the gold band around the phone looks pretty slick, too.There's just one button on the Palm — a power button that wakes the phone and puts it to sleep with one press. Two presses summon the built-in Google Assistant, while a long-press lets you power down the phone.Want to adjust the volume? Then you had better dive into the Palm's Quick Settings with a downward swipe from the top of the screen. Once there, you can raise and lower the volume with a slider. I'd prefer the convenience of a mute switch, especially for those times I need to silence my phone, but at least Palm's Life Mode keeps the phone from beeping and buzzing. (More on Life Mode in a moment.)There's no fingerprint sensor on the Palm, which instead relies on facial recognition to unlock your device. Press the power button and a lock screen appears; stare at your phone for 2 seconds or so, and it'll unlock. I found the facial-recognition feature to be somewhat responsive, if not as fast as the iPhone XS — except at night, when there was little ambient lighting around to illuminate my face. In those situations, you can tap in a PIN to unlock the Palm.Display: Some squinting requiredI like small phones. You'll pry my iPhone SE out of my hands and replace it with one of the gargantuan devices phone makers seem to favor these days at precisely the moment my 4-inch phone gives up the ghost for good.But, I think the Palm's 3.3-inch display is much too small.It's not that the screen isn't bright, though at 398 nits of peak brightness, the Palm is on the dimmer side of things. It's still brighter than the 362 nits we recorded on the Pixel 3 XL, though. I had trouble making out details of the setup instructions as they appeared on the Palm's display, but once I dove into Settings, turned off the Adaptive Brightness feature and cranked up brightness to the maximum setting, I could see everything OK.Colors appear OK, too, though they're not anything to write home about. The Palm's LCD screen re-created 105.9 percent of the sRGB color spectrum. That's nowhere near the 170.2 percent turned in by the OLED panel of the Pixel 3 XL, however. That showed when I watched Mary Poppins Returns through YouTube on both phones. Mary's blue coat and red scarf added a pop of color to the dreary Banks house on the Pixel, but didn't appear as vibrant on the Palm's screen. The animated sequences looked less lively, too. Then again, you're not going to be consuming a lot of content on a 3.3-inch screen, and at least the colors the Palm does display are very accurate. We recorded a Delta-E rating of 0.23 for the Palm, which is close to the ideal score of 0.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe problem with the Palm's display has nothing to do with colors, though — it's all about details, which invariably get lost on a screen this tiny. I have pretty good eyesight for a fellow in his late 40s, and when reading emails and texts, I found myself squinting in a way I don't have to do on the comparatively spacious iPhone SE's screen. It's a good thing the Palm is built for quick glances and emergency check-ins, because having to do any prolonged work on that tiny patch of screen space would lead to some serious eyestrain.Life Mode: Blocking out distractionsWith its focus on weaning you off your smartphone, the Palm's most notable feature is Life Mode. Flip that on, and you won't be bothered by any calls or texts. Once Life Mode's on and your screen is off, your Palm won't ring when someone calls, texts won't make the device buzz and notifications will remain as silent as the tomb. Turn the screen back on, and messages and notifications will sync up.Life Mode worked as advertised. Once the feature was turned on, I could enjoy dinner with my family or watch my daughter's swim practice uninterrupted by incoming calls or texts — provided I had the discipline to keep the screen turned off. When I pressed the power button and used ""face unlock"" to wake the screen, however, those notifications and texts came through, usually within a few seconds.From what I can tell, though, there's no way to see if you missed any calls while Life Mode was switched on. The Recent Calls list in the Palm's phone app only showed incoming calls from when I had Life Mode turned off. If I wanted to see whether anyone tried to reach me by phone when I had Life Mode enabled, I would either have to check voicemail — to do so from the Palm, you dial your own phone number and then enter your password; there's no visual indicator of any messages — or wait until I had my main phone back in my hand.I'm all for disconnecting from the rest of the world when I want to devote my full attention to what's going on around me. But when I do check back in, I want to make sure that I'm able to get all the messages I missed during my downtime. Not having an easy way to spot missed phone calls is a big whiff by Palm.Another Life Mode flaw: There doesn’t seem to be any way for emergency calls to override the feature the way that repeated phone calls from the same number will disable features like Do Not Disturb on the iPhone. I placed five consecutive calls from the same phone number to my Palm’s number when Life Mode was turned on — none of them got through or disabled the feature.Interface and Performance: Too much clutterIt may be running Android, but the interface that the Palm reminds me of the most is the Apple Watch's. As with Apple's smartwatch, there's a swirl of app icons for you to navigate, which you do by swiping up and down the screen to see all your apps.For a phone that purports to bring some measure of simplicity to your life, the Palm sure comes with a lot of preinstalled apps. You've got a bunch that make perfect sense to include — Mail, Message+, Google Maps, even Google Play Music for when you want to take your smaller phone on a run — but there are others that seem like an odd fit for a device this tiny. Why you'd want to watch videos on the Palm's cramped screen is a mystery to me, but YouTube and Google Play Movies are both here, and there's no way to delete them.You've got access to Google Play, too, which means just about any Android app can be installed on your Palm, from social networking apps to games. Again, this seems to defeat the purpose of a phone that you're only supposed to use on occasion, but the option is there to fully trick out your Palm with every Android app you could possibly want.At least you're given some control over where those apps appear on your Palm's screen. Long-press on an app icon and a list of shortcut commands will appear — a feature that I actually like about the Palm. Among those shortcuts is the Move Icon option, which then allows you to drag apps to wherever you want on the screen. It's not always precise, and if you accidentally drag one icon on top of another, you'll create a folder. But you do have some way to move the apps you use a lot to the top of the Palm's interface, and the ones you'd rather not use but can't delete to the bottom.What kind of performance can you expect from those apps when you fire them up? Well, Palm doesn't pretend its phone is a workhorse. The Snapdragon 435 processor is aided by 3GB of RAM, but that's not a recipe for raw power. On Geekbench 4, a benchmark that chronicles overall performance, the Palm turned in a score of 2,370. That's behind the LG X Venture (2,613), a midrange phone that features the same mobile processor, but ahead of the aging ZTE Max XL (1,865).MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialThat performance is acceptable, if not blisteringly fast, which will be fine for things like composing emails and firing off texts, but that kind of performance is not really up to the task of handling multiplayer shooters like PUBG Mobile. (Mind you, you can install PUBG on the Palm if, like me, you are a crazy person, but be prepared for some stuttering and dropped frames when you're running from enemy fire.) Toggling between apps is smooth enough, though I sometimes noticed a lag between when I tapped on a field to write a text in Messages+ and when the on-screen keyboard finally popped up.Camera: Not bad in a pinchThe Palm won't replace your camera or even your camera phone. But if it's the device you happen to have on you when you need to snap a photo, you'll be generally pleased with the results — provided the lights are bright.To see how the Palm's 12-megapixel rear camera fared, I compared it to the Pixel 3 XL I had paired with the smaller phone. That's not a terribly fair comparison on paper — Google's latest Pixels are our favorite camera phones, thanks in large part to image-enhancing software features — but I wanted to see what I was giving up when I left my main phone behind in favor of the Palm.There's not too much of a sacrifice if the conditions are right and the scene you're shooting is fairly static. My neighbor's holiday display looks as festive when shot by the Palm as it does with the Pixel 3 XL. The Pixel's colors are a little more true-to-life, but the Palm picks up a few more tiny details, such as the colored lights in one of the background Christmas trees.I began to see more of a gap when I switched to portrait shots. My daughter's skin looks slightly washed out in the Palm's shot. Certainly, she has a warmer skin tone in the Pixel's version, which brings out the blueness of her eyes. You can see more details in her purplish-blue coat, as well as on the surface of the school blacktop. It's just a richer, more inviting shot.But the biggest difference can be seen at night, when the Pixel 3 XL's Night Sight feature saves the day. The edges around the paper lanterns are sharp and focused, and the blue fairy lights hanging overhead cast a distinct glow as well. You can even make out a decoration hanging on the fence in the far background. The Palm's camera doesn't capture those details, and the blue lights look purple. There's a little bit of noise around the lanterns, too. And that's with the Palm's automatic flash turned off so that it doesn't wash any hint of color out of the shot.The rear camera on the Palm can work in a pinch, but the same can't be said of the 8-MP front camera. The sky behind me is an overexposed blur, which casts an unnatural cloud over part of my face; my hair looks particularly muted too. (Other shots taken with the Palm's front camera looked so clouded, I suspect that I had smudged the lens during the course of using the tiny phone. The shot you see here comes after giving the front of the Palm a thorough wipe-down.) While the Pixel smooths out my skin a little too much for my liking, everything in the shot is better-focused, and individual details like the dueling colors in my beard really stand out.Battery: Keep a charging cable closeAll you have to do is look at the Palm's spec sheet — which lists an 800-mAh battery — to realize you're not getting through the day on a single charge, despite Palm's optimistic promise of all-day battery life. (For context, the Pixel 3 XL has a 3,430-mAh battery to keep things up and running.) Palm's premise is that you're only going to be glancing at your phone now and then instead of using it constantly, so the battery won't drain as quickly as a result.That's probably true to a point. My Palm was fully charged when I started writing this review, and even though I'm frequently firing it up to double-check features as I write, it's still only down to 87 percent of its battery. Then again, I have Life Mode turned on, which extends the battery life considerably. When Life Mode's disabled, you're going to see the battery drain faster.Case in point: we ran the Tom's Guide battery test, which features continuous web surfing over LTE (using Verizon's network in this case). The Palm died after 2 hours and 38 minutes, which is more than 7 hours less than the 9:48 average we've gotten from full-sized phones.One day, after a pretty intensive testing session, the Palm's battery was at 61 percent when I wrapped up for the night. I forgot to plug in the Palm overnight, and when I got back to my desk in the morning, it was down to a 28 percent charge after sitting idle for more than 12 hours.You can recharge the Palm fairly quickly, though: The company promises that you can fully juice a drained battery in 68 minutes. That morning, when I discovered I had left the Palm unplugged overnight, I was able to get the battery from 28 percent to fully charged within an hour.Palm SpecsBottom LineWe all need to spend less time staring at our phones, so at least there's a good idea behind the Palm. But part of the problem is that the phone lacks the courage of its convictions. If we're supposed to use the Palm only intermittently, why preload it with apps that are contrary to that mission? And, why let people add even more apps that can potentially suck away time and attention? Features that do serve Palm's stated mission, like Life Mode, could stand to be fine-tuned, and it should be easier to control the phone's volume.Then there's the matter of the Palm's $350 price tag — which isn't insignificant at a time when the prices of fully featured smartphones are on the rise. It's tempting to compare and contrast a companion phone like the Palm to an LTE-enabled smartwatch. You'd certainly pay more for the watch — the Apple Watch Series 4 starts at $499 if you want LTE connectivity — but you'd get a device that offers the same features as the Palm in a form factor that's better suited for at-a-glance uses. And the watch throws in health and fitness tracking features not found in the Palm.I like the idea of using my smartphone less. I'm not sure adding a second smartphone is the way to go about it, though.Credit: Tom's Guide"
144,Moto Z4,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-z4,review-6544.html","Updated June 13 1:48 p.m. ET: Review updated with impressions of the Night Vision camera feature and news about a great deal on the Moto Z4 for new Verizon customers at Best Buy.  What even is a flagship phone, anyway? That's the question Motorola appears to be asking with the Moto Z4, the latest iteration of its modular handset that mixes premium design and features with somewhat modest hardware, for an attractive price.Like the Moto Z3 Play before it, the Moto Z4 starts at $499. However, Motorola has confirmed it won't be releasing a more powerful Force variant of the Z4, as it has with previous entries to the Z lineup. That means the Z4 — with its humble Snapdragon 675 chipset — is the range-topping Motorola device for 2019, at least in North America where the company's Motorola One line isn't available.In fairness, though, the Moto Z4 can do things other phones can't. It supports the full range of Moto Mods, so it can work on Verizon's 5G network with the help of the 5G Mod. At $499 — either unlocked or through Big Red — the Z4 is a formidable adversary for our new favorite midrange handset, the Pixel 3a. Just don't expect its camera to compare to Google's.Pricing and availabilityThe Moto Z4 is sold both unlocked and through Verizon for $499. The unlocked device hit Best Buy, B&H Photo and Amazon June 6; it comes with the 360 Camera Moto Mod packed in. That Mod debuted at $199, but you can find it on Amazon for about $50 these days.Like all of Motorola's unlocked handsets, the Z4 can run on GSM- and CDMA-based networks alike. Only the Flash Gray model is available at launch; the Frost White version is coming later this summer.There’s something about the way the gold Mod pins play off against the matte white that is delightfully classy. The Moto Z series has never looked better.As for Verizon, things get a bit more interesting. The carrier is offering a limited-time promotion whereupon new activations will be able to snag the Moto Z4 and a 5G Mod for $439. That lowers the barrier to 5G service considerably — the Galaxy S10 5G costs $1,299 for context — though you'lll still have to pay for either Verizon's $85 Beyond Unlimited or $95 Above Unlimited monthly plans to get 5G service. (Right now, 5G access is provided in these plans for no extra charge, though eventually it'll cost an extra $10 per month.)Alternatively, anyone opening a new line with Verizon can get the phone itself for a total of $240, or $10 per month over 24 months — essentially getting the phone for half off. And for a limited time, Best Buy will sell the phone for half that — $120 total, or $5 over 24 months — for activations on new lines.Design: The smartest-looking Z yetBecause the Moto Z4 supports Moto Mods, and because the spec for the Mod platform date back three years, there's no getting around the Z4's proportional similarity to prior Moto Z models. Motorola is locked into a design, to a certain extent. It can't really change the shape of the device without breaking Mod compatibility.That's not to say the company hasn't done a lot to improve the Z series design where it can. The Z4's new 6.4-inch OLED display incorporates a teardrop notch and features minimal bezels all around. The back of the phone is glass, but it's been etched in a matte finish that feels really pleasing to the touch. Doug Michau, Motorola's head of product operations, told me this wasn't a cheap process to implement, but the team felt it was a worthwhile one. I'm inclined to agree.Using the Z4’s in-screen fingerprint sensor will feel like ages to anyone used to instantaneous capacitive scanners.The Z4 comes in two colorways — Flash Gray and Frost White — and while our sample unit is of the Gray variety, I really dig the aesthetic of the latter flavor. There's just something about the way the gold Mod pins play off against the matte white that is delightfully classy. Motorola’s modular phones have never looked better.Finicky fingerprint sensorYou won't find a fingerprint sensor on the back or sides of the Moto Z4, and there's certainly no room for it on the front, given how tight those bezels are. Motorola has opted for an optical in-display fingerprint sensor here, which makes a lot of sense for the Z line.Sadly, the sensor is less useful in practice. The scanner in the Z4 is one of the fussiest in-display solutions I've used. Like other optical systems, the scanner is sensitive to pressure and placement. And even after you've gotten acclimated to its preferences, there'’s still a palpable delay — at times as much as 1.3 seconds — before you're through to your home screen. That might sound fine enough on paper, but I assure you it'll feel like ages to anyone used to instantaneous capacitive sensors. For what it's worth, Motorola says the sensor is at least clever enough to learn from false readings over time, so it should get faster and better with continued use.One last point on the Z4's design front that shouldn't go unnoticed: Motorola has brought back the headphone jack for this phone, after nixing it on the original Moto Z out of a desire to make that older model as slender as possible. (People apparently care more about being able to use their existing accessories rather than shaving off a millimeter of thickness — who would've thought?) Strangely, though, the Z4's single speaker isn't next to the 3.5-millimeter port — it's actually on the top edge. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just really unusual.Display: Colorful, but dimWhile the Moto Z's footprint stays the same, the display within it has grown markedly year after year. What started as a 5.5-inch panel is now a 6.4-inch OLED display with slim bezels all around and a notch up top.With a 2340 x 1080 resolution, satisfyingly punchy hues and good visibility no matter the viewing angle, the Moto Z4's screen is all-around great for this price. In fact, I prefer it to the Pixel 3a's OLED display, which exhibits a slight green cast and doesn't maintain its color balance quite as well when you aren't looking at it straight on.That said, the Pixel 3a can get brighter; where the Moto Z4 topped out with a peak full-screen brightness of 380 nits under our light meter, the Pixel 3a reached 401 nits. The Pixel 3a also exhibited slightly more accurate hues, owing to its Delta-E score of 0.18, versus the Z4's 0.24 result (numbers closer to zero are better). Those who prefer more saturated colors, however, will appreciate the Z4's 221% coverage of the sRGB gamut. Conversely, the Pixel 3a topped out at 182%.Camera: Google keeps its crownMotorola has tried to make the biggest strides with the Z4's camera. On the back of the device lives a whopping 48-megapixel lens with an ƒ/1.6 aperture and optical image stabilization.That's the highest megapixel count of any image sensor that Motorola's embedded into a phone, and thanks to the addition of quad-pixel binning — a trick employed by our current top camera phone, the Huawei P30 Pro — the Z4's camera has been designed to use that wealth of data captured to pump out optimized 12-MP shots with superior low-light detail. The same goes for the 25-MP selfie shooter notched in the Z4's OLED screen, which also benefits from pixel binning technology.Those are exciting features you don't typically find in a $499 smartphone. And yet, they haven't appeared to make the Z4's photography appreciably better — especially compared with the just-released $399 Pixel 3a.Capturing a pair of portraits of my colleague Caitlin, the Z4 obviously opts for a more zoomed-out perspective. Neither of these devices feature telephoto lenses, though Google's software crops in within the frame to get closer to the subject, so the resulting portrait is a bit more dramatic.There's some roughness concerning the way blurring is handled around Caitlin's hair in the Pixel 3a's rendition. That's not surprising, given that many mobile cameras struggle with long hair in shallow depth-of-field shots. But overall, the Z4's unnaturally warm cast, blurring of finer details (like the texture of the subject's skin) and inconsistent separation between the foreground and background, particularly around the stone ledge, lose this round for Motorola.Looking out from the edge of Bryant Park outside Tom's Guide's New York office, the Moto Z4 delivered another decent yet somewhat hazy shot, that plainly lacked the presence and contrast that the Pixel 3a achieved. Motorola's 48-MP sensor crisply rendered the people relaxing on the lawn, as well as the stage banner at the far end of the park. However, the sky is a bit too gray, the clouds are flat, and the colors are smoky in general. Yet Motorola can claim a small victory — at least the Z4 avoided the lens flare that plagued the left edge of the Pixel 3a's shot.Turning to some photos that demonstrate the Z4's zoom capabilities, we can see how Motorola has tried to use software to make up for the lack of a secondary telephoto lens. Both the Z4 and the Pixel 3a were tuned to 2x power here, though Google's Super Res Zoom technology clearly wins out. Even ignoring the profound difference in color (the Z4's balancing is nowhere close to the real conditions), Motorola's computational photography still can't resolve the wrinkles and velvety texture of the petals, or the semi-furry sheen of the greenery below.Improving low-light photos is a priority for pretty much every smartphone maker these days, and much like its rivals, Motorola has decided to tackle that problem with the help of software. The Z4 introduces Night Vision, which combines eight frames of an image, as well as dynamic noise reduction and sharpening, to produce a cleaner result despite dim surroundings.Initially, Night Vision was't enabled on our Z4 when we first conducted our review. Eventually, an update to the Moto Camera app on the Play Store added the feature, and we're pleased to report the results are quite impressive. Night Vision processed the first of the two photos you see above, taken in our indoor studio with barely any light in the room, in less time than the Pixel 3a managed with its Night Sight mode. The Z4's shot ended up noticeably brighter than the Pixel's, though not as sharp. Additionally, the colors in the faux brick wall and hanging posters are a bit washed out, comparatively speaking, through the lens of the new Moto handset.Motorola is promising a strong selfie game from the Z4's 25-MP front-facing shooter. Unfortunately, the results don't back up those claims. The Z4 aggressively smoothed the subject's face (even though all retouching features were turned off), glossed over the filtering of sunlight through the leaves of the trees in the background and washed out the lush greens of this summer scene.MORE: Best Camera Phone 2019In this example, Motorola's quad-pixel technology may have actually hurt more than helped; while you can opt for full-resolution, 25-MP shots from the front camera in the settings, the default is 5 MP, where every four pixels are binned together. The resulting images taken in this mode are too blurry and low-res to truly impress.Performance: In line with 2018 flagshipsAt the heart of the Moto Z4 beats Qualcomm's Snapdragon 675 octa-core chipset. This silicon is the next step up from the 670 CPU inside Google's new Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL, and provides adequate performance for everyday use. That chip is backed by 4GB of RAM and a spacious 128GB of storage, while a microSD slot can be used to expand the latter even further.I was surprised to find that the Z4 defaulted to playing PUBG Mobile at High settings, which is quite rare for a phone not powered by one of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 800-series chipsets. The graphics were crisp and the frame rate was passable, barring some hiccups here and there. That's impressive for a phone that scored only 1,038 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test; for comparison's sake, the $749 Samsung Galaxy S10e topped out at 5,616.Regarding overall performance, the Z4 achieved a Geekbench 4 score of 6,506, which is actually quite close to last year's flagships, in whichthe Galaxy S9 and Pixel 3 both finished around the 7,300 mark. That makes the Z4 quite respectable among its midrange competitors — especially when compared with the Pixel 3a's 5,146 score. On the other hand, the $549 OnePlus 6T hit 8,972 thanks to its Snapdragon 845 chipset, so the Motorola's handset still isn't the best value in terms of performance.Battery life: Excellent endurance, average charging speedThe Moto Z4's battery has seen a sizable bump in capacity, up to 3,600 mAh from 3,000 mAh in the Z3 series. Motorola has also baked in 15-watt fast charging, which won't top the device up quite as quickly as the 18W charging of the Pixel 3a — let alone the OnePlus 7 Pro’s 30W Warp Charge adapter — though it's better than nothing.MORE: Best Phone Battery Life - Longest Lasting Smartphone BatteriesIn our battery test, where we had the device stream websites endlessly over Verizon's LTE network at 150 nits of brightness, the Z4 lasted 11 hours and 31 minutes. That's quite a good result, especially given that last year's Moto Z3 Play endured a respectable 10 hours and 3 minutes. However, the Pixel 3a still managed to eclipse the Z4, at 11 hours and 59 minutes.Motorola should be commended for keeping Mods around this long. But aside from the 5G Mod, things seem to have hit a dead end.Still, we wish the Z4 was quicker to charge. The included 15-watt TurboPower adapter got the handset from empty to 37 percent capacity in 30 minutes, which really isn't anything special these days.Moto Mods: Little has changedThere are currently 13 Moto Mods available, per Motorola's website. Those range from the Insta-Share Projector to a selection of speakers, Mods that transform the Z4 into an Amazon Alexa-enabled smart speaker or a Polaroid-printing camera, and of course, even one that grants it 5G capabilities on Verizon's network. Meanwhile, a few of the more interesting Mods, like the wireless charging Style Shell, have been curiously discontinued.Motorola should be commended for keeping the Moto Mods platform alive and kicking as long as it has. We're now four generations deep, and every single Mod out there — barring the 5G one, which is a bit more complicated than the rest — works with every Z-series handset. In fact, Motorola has confirmed it will soon release an update that will expand 5G Mod support to the Moto Z2 Force on Verizon's network.And yet, our long-standing qualms about Moto Mods haven't dissipated over the years. Thirteen still doesn't make for a massive selection, especially considering how old (and disappointing, in the case of the Hasselblad Zoom Mod) many of them are.MORE: 5G Phones: Every Known Phone and Release DateIn fairness, most of the roster has been discounted at this point — that 360 Camera Mod has fallen to a quarter of its original $199 asking price, the projector and Polaroid Mods can be had for around $100 now, and JBL's SoundBoost 2 speaker has fallen from $79 to a much easier-to-stomach $45 on Amazon. On the flip side, perhaps that only signals that development has reached a dead end.Unless you've already sunk money into the platform — or you're really, really excited about 5G — we're not seeing the kind of investment in new ideas to draw new followers into Motorola's modular vision.Software: Pure Android, with extrasArmed with Android 9 Pie, the Z4 runs a pure installation of Google's operating system, with the only customizations coming from Motorola's handy gestures and shortcuts. Those include twisting to launch the camera and chopping to activate the flashlight, as well as the manufacturer's One-Button Nav system, which replaces typical Android controls with a swipeable button.One-Button Nav is arguably cleverer than Google's stock gesture system, as seen in the Pixel 3 and 3a, because it requires a slimmer strip of the display real estate and doesn't implement a separate Back key. Tapping the button sends you home, long pressing triggers the Assistant, swiping left takes you back and swiping right returns to your last-opened app. If you swipe up to the center of the screen, you'll see your recents page, joined by accompanying suggestions for other apps the system thinks you might want to use, given established habits.You don't have to use One-Button Nav if you don't want to. And just as with previous Motorola phones, that holds true for just about all of the shortcuts and ""experiences"" housed in the Moto app. However, many of them, like the three-finger swipe to capture screenshots, are pretty useful.MORE: Motorola Moto Z4 Prices - Compare The Best PlansThe Z4 should see two Android version upgrades during its life — first to Android Q later this year or early next, and then to Android R in 2020. That's one update less than the Pixel 3a will receive, as Google has committed to three years of support for that phone. Additionally, as a Google product, it's worth noting that the Pixel 3a is all but guaranteed to receive updates faster.Bottom lineMotorola has charted a more iterative cycle of development for its flagship Z series. And while some will certainly lament the lack of a ""true"" flagship topping the company's portfolio of phones, the Z4 remains a solid — if not awe-inspiring — value in the growing sub-$500 segment.In fact, Motorola's latest modular effort is a compelling rival to Google's $399 Pixel 3a or $479 Pixel 3a XL — though the phone is for a different type of customer. If you're willing to cast aside Google's best-in-class camera for a slight boost in performance, a roomier display and of course modularity, the Moto Z4 is a good choice. Plus, the Z4s premium metal-and-glass composition just feels sturdier and longer-lasting.Additionally, there's something to be said for Motorola's 5G ambitions. Although we don't think you need to run out and buy a 5G-ready handset today, as Verizon's 5G network isn't widespread enough yet, it's nice to see a manufacturer spearheading an affordable path to next-gen connectivity.However, that's a very particular need. Once again, Motorola's latest Z series phone feels like a niche product that only a certain type of customer will truly get the most out of — like a 5G early adopter, or the tinkerer who sees a lot of value in Moto Mods. For everyone else, though, the Pixel 3a's camera, lengthier software support and lower starting price makes Google's device too attractive to pass up.Credit: Tom's Guide"
145,OnePlus 6T,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/oneplus-6t,review-5886.html","After years of releasing affordable, stylish Android phones, OnePlus is now pushing boundaries with the OnePlus 6T, the first smartphone to sport an in-display fingerprint sensor in the U.S. The OnePlus 6T's magical sensor works like a charm and makes us wish other smartphones would add this option in addition to facial recognition.But the 6T also doubles down on value: the base storage increases from 64GB to 128GB on this version, while the price ticks up just $20 from the OnePlus 6. The $549 entry-level 6T remains about half the price of other flagship phones with edge-to-edge displays and cutting-edge specs, and you don't even have to sacrifice great photos or solid battery life to save all that money.And a new carrier partnership with T-Mobile widens the availability of the 6T, which will make OnePlus more competitive with the likes of Google, Samsung and even Apple. This is one of the best smartphones with few downsides. Also, be sure to check out our face-off between the OnePlus 6T and Galaxy S10, and between the OnePlus 6T and the newer OnePlus Nord.Editor's note, June 11: The OnePlus 7 Pro is now on sale, which means you can snag a OnePlus 6T with more storage for $30 less. But the 7 Pro is worth the extra money — check out our full review to find out why.  OnePlus 6T Cheat Sheet: What You Need to KnowOnePlus 6T Price and AvailabilityFor the first time, OnePlus is offering its latest flagship through a U.S. carrier, T-Mobile, which will introduce the company's phones to a wider audience.T-Mobile began selling the OnePlus 6T online and in stores Nov. 1. The carrier offers only one variant of the device, the Mirror Black version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $579. T-Mobile is offering a trade-in deal for the 6T, with up to 30 eligible devices giving you $300 toward the cost of the new phone.On OnePlus's website, you can also find a Midnight Black model in three varieties: A $549 version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (£499, €549), the aforementioned $579 version (£529, €579) and a beastly $629 6T (£579, €629) with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. The T-Mobile version will be locked to that carrier's network until it's paid off, but the 6T will be available to buy unlocked and supported on Verizon and AT&T in the U.S.OnePlus previously offered a Thunder Purple variant of the 6T, though that model has since sold out. It has moved on to a McLaren-branded limited edition variant that carries a special carbon fiber and Papaya Orange design, 10GB of RAM, 256GB of storage and OnePlus' new Warp Charging system. It costs $699 (£649) and is sold exclusively through the phone maker's website.The OnePlus 6 is now sold out on the company's website, but is still available on Amazon. The 6 is $50 less than the 6T, but it doesn't have an in-display fingerprint sensor and isn't available to buy through a carrier.Design: Matte beauty with teardrop notchOnePlus isn't pushing any design boundaries with the 6T, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The matte Midnight Black model I tested is a subtle standout in a sea of glassy black 6-inch slabs (i.e., almost every other Android flagship). The glossy Mirror Black shade is more run-of-the-mill. Unfortunately, OnePlus isn't releasing a Silk White variant of the 6T, at least not yet. The pearly finish of that OnePlus 6 model was one-of-a-kind. The Mirror and Midnight Black hues are standard for OnePlus, so it would be nice to see a fresh shade for the  6T.OnePlus has slightly refined its go-to aesthetic for the 6T with tweaks like a teardrop-shaped notch, which is significantly smaller than the iPhone X-style notch at the top of the OnePlus 6's display. The 6T's bottom bezel is also a smidge thinner than its predecessor's. But the overall dimensions have remained largely the same over the years, even as display size has increased and the fingerprint sensor has moved from chin to back to beneath the display.And even though OnePlus has embraced glass with the 6T and ditched the headphone jack (yes, it's true), the company has still shied away from supporting wireless charging.Display: Still stunningThe OnePlus 6T’s display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price. The expansive, 6.4-inch AMOLED (2340 x 1080) panel is slightly taller than the OnePlus 6's screen, but the most noticeable difference is the less obtrusive dewdrop notch. OnePlus slimmed down the camera cut-out from the 6's iPhone X replica to one that resembles the short-lived Essential Phone. The design tweak makes the screen feel truly edge-to-edge in a way that notched flagships don't.The OnePlus 6T's display isn't quite as rich and bright as the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or the iPhone XS Max, but those phones will cost you $1,000. The 6T's panel is comparable to the Pixel 3's, which costs $200 or so more than the 6T, in brightness and color accuracy. The 6T hit 405 nits on our light meter, beating the 401-nit max hit by the Pixel 3, and covers 222.6 percent of the sRGB color gamut to the Pixel's 202 percent range. The 6T's screen is also more true-to-life, with a Delta-E rating of 0.36, compared with the Pixel’s 0.44. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)The OnePlus 6T's expansive 6.4-inch OLED display quality easily rivals flagships twice its price.Watching the trailer for Fantastic Beasts 2: The Crimes of Grindelwald, where there are dark, dramatic scenes layered with shades of black and streaked with brilliant blue flames, I noticed the 6T's display was dimmer than other OLED panels, such as the Galaxy Note 9 and the iPhone XS Max. But again, for the price, the 6T's display is very good, and the tear-shaped notch almost fades away when immersed in a video.OnePlus 6T SpecsThe 6T's display lights up with a fingerprint indicator so you're not blindly jabbing at the screen to unlock the device. Simply press lightly on the indicator and the phone will snap open to the home screen. This happens almost instantly — in 0.34 seconds, OnePlus says. (It definitely felt that fast to me.)OnePlus isn't the first phone maker to put a fingerprint sensor in the display, but this one is less finicky and works instantly.The sensor isn't perfect, but they never are, not even the Touch ID sensors on older iPhones. Occasionally, the 6T's display didn't recognize my fingerprint, usually when I pressed too quickly or didn't stick the landing. A second try always did the trick.MORE: 15 Best Mobile Privacy and Security AppsThis is the future of smartphone technology — at least until facial scanning becomes more advanced. The 6T's in-display sensor can authenticate Google Pay transactions; the device's facial recognition cannot, because it's less secure than the fingerprint. Unlike newer iPhones, which have a TrueDepth front-facing camera to thoroughly map your face, the OnePlus 6T's camera takes a quick, 2D scan. It's not foolproof.Camera: Improved, but not amazingOnePlus didn't make any tweaks to the camera hardware in the 6T. Like the 6, the new model sports a dual-lens rear shooter with a 16-megapixel and 20-MP lens and a 20-MP front-facing lens.But the company made some software enhancements to boost photo quality, particularly in portraits and at night. A new Night mode, which you can select from the lower menu in the camera preview, lengthens the exposure time to capture more detail in low-light settings.Unfortunately, that exposure doesn't do much to enhance the quality of a low-light image, as you can see in the below comparison of the same spooky Halloween display lit colorful lights and a street lamp. With Night mode activated, the shot is brighter overall but also looks overexposed, so you lose detail and contrast. The image isn't much better without Night mode, but looks slightly less grainy.The Pixel 3 captures the variation in the purple lights, and also brings up the contrast in the black spiders on the staircase. The red of the monstrous ghost's eyes and hands is far more vivid in the Pixel 3's shot. This is without the Pixel 3's forthcoming Night Sight mode, which reportedly makes the device's low-light shots dramatically better. The iPhone XR’s shot is more true-to-life — the purple and red hues look like they did in person, even if there's not as much contrast as in the Pixel 3's result.In a challenging setup with purple lights reflected against a house in a different Halloween display, the 6T's Night mode fared better, but still looked dull and unsaturated overall. The Pixel 3, for comparison, oversaturated the purple light and made it look blue. The iPhone XR's shot was again the most true-to-life — the purple and orange lights looked as they did in reality.Capturing a photo in Night mode on the 6T takes several seconds to process, and you have to stay still the entire time. Unless you have a lot of time to spend shooting, Night mode isn't all that useful.In daytime, I used the 6T's optical zoom and the Pixel 3's Super Res Zoom to capture a photo of the arch at Brooklyn’s Grand Army Plaza from a distance. This is where the Pixel 3's AI-assisted images become a matter of personal preference. The 6T's colors are more accurate — the arch, trees, green street lamps and bluish-gray early morning sky all look like they did when I snapped the image. The Pixel 3's shot is far moodier and dramatic, with more depth, thanks to the shadows deepened by the Pixel's software. But that's not how it actually looked, so points to the 6T for a more realistic photo.OnePlus said it made improvements to the 6T's Portrait mode, but it didn't blow me away. In this shot of me taken from the same angle and distance on the 6T, Pixel 3 and iPhone XR, the 6T was overall too smooth — every detail from my hair to my skin to my hands looks like it's been airbrushed. The Pixel 3 struggled with the bokeh effect to the right of me; the leaves, black gate and half of the tree trunk behind me are still in focus. The XR nails both the colors of my skin and the flowers behind the gate, and also applies the bokeh evenly behind me.The good news is that the 6T's camera software enhancements are rolling out to the OnePlus 6, so there's no urgent need to upgrade from OnePlus' previous phone unless you desperately want an in-display fingerprint reader and a smaller notch.Performance: Flagship speed for lessThe 6T shares the same specs as the 6, so performance is unchanged in the newer device. The phone's 8GB of RAM and Snapdragon 845 processor deliver flagship speeds, besting even Samsung's Galaxy Note 9 (with 6GB of RAM) and Google's Pixel 3 XL (4GB).In the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance, the 6T notched a score of 8,972, on a par with the 6's score of 9,098. The Note 9 clocked in at 8,876, while the Pixel 3 XL delivered a comparatively underwhelming score of 7,864. All Android flagships fall short of the new iPhones’ Geekbench scores, thanks to their A12 Bionic chip. But the 6T is easily best-in-class for hundreds of dollars less than its Android competitors.OnePlus says it made tweaks in the latest version of OxygenOS — about 500 tweaks, to be more precise — to make it even better. One of those features, Smart Boost, clears background apps that are used less often, no matter how recently you opened them. That app-management feature improves app launch speeds by up to 20 percent, the company said. This was noticeable in my testing. Cold-launching PUBG Mobile on the 6 and 6T side by side, both apps opened simultaneously, but the 6T loaded several seconds faster than its predecessor. OnePlus says this feature is  limited to gaming apps, but even when I launched Netflix on both devices, I noticed the 6T loaded the welcome screen 6 seconds faster than the 6.All apps launched quickly, including PUBG Mobile, and swiping between them with the 6T's Android Pie-based gesture controls was seamless. Not only does the 6T launch apps quickly, it's a gaming powerhouse. On 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme Unlimited test of graphics performance, the $579 8GB version of the 6T scored 5,183 — far ahead of the Pixel 3 XL's score of 4,396 and the iPhone XR’s result, 4,416.The new McLaren model of the 6T adds another 2GB of RAM for a total of 10GB. This means even more headroom to instantly launch apps from memory and juggle various tasks, though because the 6T isn't starved for RAM by any means, this change didn't make a difference in our performance benchmarking results.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowWhere the 6T fell short is in our real-world performance test, transcoding a 2-minute 4K video into 1080p in the Adobe Premiere app. Other flagships can crush this in less than 3 minutes, but the 6T (like the 6 before it) took 3:45 to accomplish the task.We're at the point where all flagship smartphones are high-powered performers that can accomplish any task quickly. But those phones are all extremely expensive. Even the ""budget"" iPhone XR is $750. The fact that the 6T can easily compete on that playing field for less than $600 is impressive.Software: An elegant twist on Android PieOnePlus has crafted its own take on Android, OxygenOS, which is a sophisticated vision of Google's operating system. The 6T ships with Android 9.0 Pie overlaid with the latest version of OxygenOS, so you can take advantage of the new gesture-based navigation, adaptive battery support and the aforementioned Smart Boost app-launching feature. The three-button navigation bar is turned on by default, but you can switch to the gesture-based navigation in Settings.Google Lens is now part of the 6T's camera, which is a nice touch. OnePlus has shied away from baking in Google's services; Google Assistant isn't a high priority, for instance, the way it is so deeply entwined in the Pixel 3. If you want Assistant integration, the 6T isn't the best device.Battery LifeThe OnePlus 6T’s 3,700 mAh battery is slightly bigger than the OnePlus 6's 3,300 mAh pack, but the new device also has a slightly larger display. The two phones ran neck-and-neck in the Toms Guide Battery Test of continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, with the 6T lasting 10 hours and 23 minutes and the 6 lasting just 10 minutes longer. The smartphone average is 9:50.In my five days of testing the 6T, I found it to be a champ. For instance, I charged up the 6T to 100 percent and then used it for 20 hours, from late afternoon to lunchtime the following day. I took the phone running, listening to the new Robyn album over Apple Music.After streaming Dr. Strange on Netflix over T-Mobile's LTE network on a full charge, the 6T still had 77 percent life after 90 minutes.I streamed YouTube videos. I took several rounds of photos. I paired running headphones to the phone and used its app to fine-tune the settings. I uploaded files to Dropbox. After all that, the 6T's battery was still chugging along at 50 percent.MORE: OnePlus 6T McLaren Scorches Rivals In Charging Speed TestIn a video-streaming test, where I watched Dr. Strange on Netflix over T-Mobile's LTE network on a full charge, the 6T still had 77 percent life after 90 minutes.Two flagship features the 6T is still missing are wireless charging and an IP rating. The device's all-glass body would make wireless charging possible, but the company is sticking with its Dash Charge technology for traditional charging over USB-C. Luckily, Dash Charge is incredibly fast, juicing up your OnePlus from 0 to 60 percent in 30 minutes.The recently-unveiled McLaren Edition 6T ups the charging speed even further, through the use of OnePlus' new Warp Charge 30 protocol. This adapter is rated at 30W — 10W more than the standard Dash Charger that comes with other models of the phone. This makes the McLaren variant one of the fastest charging phones we've ever tested at Tom's Guide. In just 30 minutes, it went from empty to 66 percent. In an hour, it was at 98 percent. The Warp Charge system will not work with other 6T models, and OnePlus doesn't currently sell the adapter and cable combo alone.OnePlus 6T vs. Pixel 3The biggest rivals for the OnePlus 6T is Google's Pixel 3 ($799) and Pixel 3 XL ($899). The OnePlus 6T wins on value because it starts at $549, and you get more RAM than the Pixel 3 at 6GB versus 4GB. You also have the option for 8GB of RAM with the 6T. For the money, OnePlus gives you a bigger 6.4-inch display than either the Pixel 3 (5.5 inches) or Pixel 3 XL (6.3 inches).However, based on our testing, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL offer superior cameras, routinely delivering better photo quality in almost all conditions versus the OnePlus 6T. And while the 6T comes with Android Pie out of the box, Google adds compelling AI features on top, such as Call Screening and Top Shot in the camera.OnePlus 6T vs. iPhone XRThe OnePlus 6T is cheaper than the iPhone XR while offering a bigger display. The 6.2-inch-long 6T is taller than the 5.9-inch-long iPhone XR, Apple's most affordable flagship iPhone. That extra height is all display — the 6T's 6.4-inch OLED panel is simply bigger than the XR's 6.1-inch screen.For those of us with small hands, the taller screen makes it tougher to navigate the 6T one-handed than the XR, but there are worthwhile trade-offs.MORE: iPhone XR Review: The Best iPhone for the MoneyThe 6T has a slimmer notch, which makes its screen feel more immersive. Apple made the iPhone XR cheaper by using an LCD panel, which is lower-resolution than the 6T's OLED one.The OnePlus 6T offers an in-screen fingerprint reader, but the iPhone XR offers Face ID for fast unlocking. The iPhone XR also took better pictures in low light in our side-by-side tests. And while the 6T is fast, it's no match for the iPhone XR's A12 Bionic processor.Bottom LineYou won't find a better smartphone for this price. Other companies are making ultra-pricey flagships with an emphasis on artificial intelligence that just can't compete with the iPhones and Galaxies on the market (ahem, LG and HTC). There is now a glut of overpriced smartphones that don't differentiate themselves in any meaningful way.OnePlus has taken the opposite approach, a more thoughtful one that takes into account what features people actually want and how much they want to spend. An in-display fingerprint sensor seems gimmicky at first, but it's so fast and convenient that I turned off the device's facial-scanning feature. Apps load smoothly and quickly. OnePlus has tweaked Android Pie, but without annoyances or bloat.The 6T doesn't have the best camera around, but it gets the job done. If you need a smartphone that can take amazing photos, the Pixel 3 or iPhone XR are better camera phones. But for every other task, it's tough to top the OnePlus 6T.Credit: Tom's Guide"
146,LG V50 ThinQ 5G,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-v50-thinq-5g,review-6549.html","At long last, 2019 is shaping up to be the year when we're finally seeing 5G smartphones. A few weeks after Samsung's Galaxy S10 5G made its debut on Verizon's fledgling 5G network, the LG V50 ThinQ has arrived, initially as an exclusive with Sprint.We first saw LG's 5G phone at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February, and at the time, the V50 looked a lot like the V series phones that came before it. But now we've had a chance to see the phone's flagship feature — the ability to connect to faster 5G speeds — using Sprint's newly launched network, and the LG V50 is making a more distinct impression.However, slightly faster speeds aren't really enough to make this phone a must-buy, especially with availability limited to where Sprint's 5G network has come online.LG V50 5G SpecsPrice and AvailabilityFor now, Sprint's the only place to get an LG V50 ThinQ, though eventually the phone will be coming to Verizon. Sprint is selling the LG V50 for $1,152, but if you lease the phone on an 18-month Sprint Flex plan, you can pay $24 a month for the phone. That's a discount from the actual lease price.Sprint is only offering the phone in cities where 5G service is available, which is limited to Dallas, Atlanta, Houston and Kansas City at the moment. More cities will follow, though.While $1,152 is a lot to pay for a phone, the V50 doesn't cost as much as the S10 5G. Samsung's phone starts at $1,299 when you buy it through Verizon.Design: Last year's looksThere's nothing remarkable about the LG V50 ThinQ's design. LG has essentially stuffed the V50's 5G running gear and new silicon into the body of the V40, while also bumping up the battery size from 3,300 mAh to 4,000 mAh.The result is a device that is almost imperceptibly thicker. The only way you'd be able to tell one LG phone from the other is that the V50's triple-lens housing doesn't protrude from the handset's glass back like it did on the V40.Below those rear cameras, you'll still find a rear-facing fingerprint sensor. Above that sensor, however, is where things get a little more interesting. LG has baked an LED-powered 5G logo into the back of the phone that lights up in trademark Sprint yellow when the device is in use. If you feel compelled to advertise to friends and strangers that you have one of the first 5G phones in the world, this might interest you. Personally, I find it gaudy — and it's certainly not helped by the ugly logo.The 5G icon is otherwise the only notable design feature that distinguishes the V50 from the V40 — at least in the U.S. In certain markets, LG is launching a curious add-on for the V50 that would go a long way toward setting the phone apart — a second screen, called Dual Display, that clips onto the phone and functions as a cover case when closed. The panel is 6.2 inches in size, and is built to let you run multiple apps at once or use as a controller while playing certain games. The accessory won't see release in the U.S., so we weren't able to test it out. LG is still keeping quiet on pricing for now.Without the Dual Display, the V50 is otherwise an extremely average-looking phone. It comes in black (very original) and sports a notch for its front-facing cameras. It’s exactly what you'd expect from a flagship in 2018 — a problem since we're writing this sentence in 2019. Here's hoping LG has more ambitious designs in mind for future phones, especially ones that cost north of $1,000.5G ReadyAfter launching in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Kansas City, Missouri, at the end of May, Sprint's 5G network is expected to come to five additional cities soon: Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. We got a hold of the phone in Dallas after Sprint launched its 5G network there. So how does the LG V50 perform?MORE: 5G Phones: Every Known Phone and Release DateFirst, don't expect the gigabit speeds commonly associated with 5G, but that's largely because of what 5G is right now and how Sprint built out its network. Sprint is going with midband spectrum for its initial 5G launch. That allows the company to offer wider coverage but at the expense of peak speed.Still, where 5G is available, you won't mistake the speeds the V50 cranks out with LTE. In our testing around Dallas, the top speeds we saw ranged between 300 and 600 Mbps on average, which is much faster than you'd expect from an LTE network. (And much faster than you'd expect from Sprint, which fared poorly in our recent round of LTE testing when we stopped in Dallas.) It's not as fast as what we saw from the Galaxy S10 5G on Verizon's network in Chicago, but the V50 remained more consistently connected to 5G network in this round of testing.That said, a few stops around Dallas delivered some underwhelming results, with the V50 sometimes struggling to crack 200 Mbps download speeds. Some of that can be attributed to a lot of testers hitting Sprint's network at the same time, but even Sprint's engineers told us they usually topped out at 400 Mbps at some of the carrier's recommended test sites.The LG V50 had some mixed results in real-world use. At its best, it took us just 1 minute and 30 seconds to download the massive PUBG Moble game over 5G — an impressive result. Downloading a 24-episode season of Parks & Rec on the LG V50 took a little less than 8 minutes on Sprint's network, but that wasn't much of an improvement over how long it took on an iPhone XS using AT&T's LTE network.You can read our full report on 5G testing with the LG V50, but so far, the phone shows improved faster speeds (though not eye-popping numbers) with a few inconsistencies typical of a new network.Display: Big and brightThe V50's display, like the V40's, is LG's most beautiful — a 6.4-inch POLED panel with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 3120 x 1440. We were impressed by the V40's implementation of this screen and found it to be a formidable opponent to the Galaxy Note 9's display. But the Galaxy S10 5G's Dynamic AMOLED Infinity-O screen and the OnePlus 7 Pro's bezel-free display are best in class for 2019 flagships, and the V50 can't quite compare.That said, the V50's display is big and bright. The screen is almost as colorful as the OnePlus 7 Pro's highly rated panel, covering 169.5% of the sRGB color gamut. The 7 Pro offers a wider range at 180%, but the V50 slightly edges out the more affordable OnePlus flagship when it comes to color accuracy, scoring 0.17 on the Delta-E test, where numbers closer to 0 are more accurate. The 7 Pro notched a 0.18.The V50's display is just as bright as the S10 5G, reaching 522 nits on average, but the Galaxy S10 Plus is even brighter at 625 nits.As long as you don't mind the notch, the V50's OLED panel is vivid enough for watching movies or playing games. I watched a trailer for The Goldfinch on YouTube, and a tense, smoke-filled scene in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art was breathtakingly dramatic on the V50's screen.Cameras: Still good, still not the bestThe V50 inherits the triple-lens rear camera LG introduced with the V40 late last year. You get a 12-megapixel main shooter with a generous ƒ/1.5 aperture that lets an abundance of light into the sensor, aided by an ƒ/1.9 12-MP wide-angle camera and ƒ/2.4 telephoto lens for more zoomed-in portraits with a shallow depth-of-field effect.We weren't terribly impressed with the V40's camera when we reviewed the phone last year, but LG has assured us that the V50's hardware, recycled though it is, is still backed by the company's latest image-enhancing software. That includes AI scene recognition and a new Night View mode that intelligently combines 10 frames for one evenly exposed image.Still, the V50 misses out on the LG G8 ThinQ's real party piece: its 3D-sensing, time-of-flight-enabled front-facing Z Camera, that enables Air Motion gesture controls and Hand ID authentication. While the V50's selfie camera array is still dual-lens, the secondary camera is of the conventional, wide-angle type, unlike the G8's sophisticated 3D depth sensor. Still, the G8's sensor and the features it enables didn't wow us when we reviewed it earlier this year.The V50's cameras lack the bells and whistles of the G8 and Galaxy S10 5G. But the shots they deliver are perfectly acceptable, even in the cases where they're not quite as good as rival smartphone cameras.In this shot of vases of flowers lining a shop's shelves, Google's Pixel 3 wins. The contrast between the petals in each flower is crisp. The individual petals of the lone rose on the bottom right of the image are clearly delineated. The V50 blows out the upper left of the photo, where sunlight was streaming into the shop. The Galaxy S10 Plus darkens the photo, but you can still see more detail in the florals than you can in the V50.The V50 is stronger in Portrait Mode. It was a close call between the V50 and Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus, which both sport triple-lens arrays. My hair is redder in the V50's image, but the camera's blur is worse around my curls. This is a challenge most phones fail, so it's not a surprise that the V50 falls short here. The trees in the background of the S10 Plus portrait look more vivid and draw the eye immediately, but my skin and hair appear flatter than they do in real life.I turned on the V50's AI Cam feature for this shot of a Manhattan skyline, which the camera recognized as a cityscape. The blues in the V50's shot are vivid, but the S10 Plus captured a more color-accurate image. The Pixel 3 heightens the shadows and contrast of the buildings against the sky. Overall, this shot was too close to declare a winner.That's a good thing — it means smartphone cameras are becoming so sophisticated regarding software that the differences in high-end phones are almost negligible. But the fact that you can get Google's powerful photography features in a sub-$400 device such as the Pixel 3a is exactly why you shouldn't buy the V50 if you just want a good camera phone.Battery Life: Fine over 5G, but not so good on LTELG packed a 4,000 mAh battery in its 5G flagship as a safety net, in case 5G connectivity was a battery-suck. Sprint said its 2.5GHz network, which is connected to both 4G and 5G simultaneously, was less draining than 5G built on mmWave spectrum.As I raced around Dallas doing 5G testing on Sprint’s network, the V50 ThinQ chugged along admirably. After 3 hours of heavy use, during which I installed PUBG Mobile (then deleted and reinstalled it multiple times) and other apps, downloaded an entire season of Parks and Recreation, ran dozens of speed tests on Ookla's app, made a phone call to my husband and surfed the web, the V50 was down to 70%.MORE: The Best Camera PhonesI didn't get a chance to run the Tom's Guide Battery Test, continuous web-surfing until the battery dies, over 5G, but when I brought the device back with me, I tested it on Sprint's LTE network. The results were not good. The phone lasted just 8 hours and 28 minutes. That's in line with LG's other flagships, including the G8 (9:29), the V40 (8:48) and the G7 (8:35), but lags far behind rivals like the S10 Plus (12:30) and even the S10 5G (10:56).We'll need to test the V50 more extensively on a 5G network to gauge its battery performance, but right now, we're unimpressed.Performance: No match for OnePlus 7 ProWith 6GB of RAM and Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 855 processor, the V50 ThinQ turns in a decent performance.The V50 never stuttered, even as I pushed it to the limits in my 5G testing by installing giant apps, playing games, downloading dozens of TV episodes on Netflix, cruising the web and generally putting the phone through its paces.When it comes to graphics performance, the V50 is among the best. LG's latest scored 5,566 on 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 benchmark, sliding just ahead of Samsung's Galaxy S10 5G, which notched 5,563. The OnePlus 7 Pro scored 5,587 on the benchmark, while the iPhone XS hit just 4,339.MORE: 5 Ways to Speed Up Your Android Phone in Under 5 MinutesBut in Geekbench 4's test of overall system performance, the V50 hit 9,015, well below its rivals, the S10 5G (10,684), the S10 Plus (10,732) and even LG's other 2019 flagship, the G8 ThinQ (10,958). The OnePlus 7 Pro (11,227) led the pack, thanks to its 12GB of RAM.Bottom LineWith the V50 ThinQ, LG is one of the first phone makers to offer a 5G-ready device in the U.S., trailing Samsung by just a few weeks. The V50 might not be an eye-catching or even entirely new device in the same vein as the Galaxy S10 5G, but that might not matter much to LG, so long as the V50 delivers fast, reliable performance in cities where 5G is available. In my experience using the V50 on Sprint's 5G network, the phone definitely saw faster speeds, but not nearly as fast as the S10 5G on Verizon's network.However, LG should be commended for shoehorning the guts of a 5G phone into the V40's body — no small feat, as Samsung's 6.7-inch monster 5G phone proves. But aside from that technological achievement, the V50 appears all too familiar.For years, LG has unnecessarily split its premium customers between its G- and V-series lines, restricting features to one model or the other, rather than pooling all its efforts into a single flagship statement that really moves the needle. And for better or worse, that’s exactly what the company has done again for 2019.If you're really excited for 5G and you're a Sprint customer living in one of the carrier's early 5G markets, you should keep an eye out for the V50. But in our testing, 5G isn't worth the premium for this otherwise average handset.Credit: Tom's Guide"
147,Pixel 3a XL,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pixel-3a-xl,review-6454.html","Smartphone makers have a problem. They keep packing more and more features into their phones, driving up the cost. And increasingly, people aren't buying them.Market research firm IDC says smartphone sales fell 6.6 percent in the first quarter of 2019, the sixth consecutive quarter they've declined. No one's felt that pain more acutely than Google, which reported that sales of the Pixel 3 are off the pace set by the Pixel 2. And that has to be disappointing, given that the Pixel 3 is one of the best camera phones you can buy today.Google's solution: Take all the things people like about the Pixel 3 and put them in an Android phone that costs much, much less. The result is the Pixel 3a XL, a phone that looks an awful lot like the Pixel 3 XL but saves you $420. The smaller Pixel 3a, at $399, lets you save even more.But do those savings come at a cost? Opting for the Pixel 3a XL over Google’s pricier flagships means giving up a little bit in terms of performance. In the end, those sacrifices are well worth it for an affordable phone that doesn’t skimp on its camera or on battery life.Pixel 3a XL SpecsPixel 3a XL Price and AvailabilityYou can buy the Pixel 3a XL right now, and you've got more carrier options than you've ever had from Google. Previous Pixels were restricted to either Verizon or Google's own Google Fi wireless service, unless you opted for an unlocked model. With the Pixel 3a XL, Sprint, T-Mobile and US Cellular join Verizon and Google Fi among the carriers currently offering the Pixel 3a XL. Discount carrier Visible, which uses the network of parent company Verizon, says it will offer the new Google phone in June. And as before, you can buy the phone unlocked and use it on any network (like, say, AT&T, which is otherwise conspicuous by its absence).The Pixel 3a XL costs $479, a significant discount from the $899 Google charges for the Pixel 3 XL. But that price tag is also lower than the $549 starting price for the OnePlus 6T, another phone that attempts to pack premium features into a lower-cost device. That seems to be the exact market Google is courting with the Pixel 3a.DesignAt first glance, you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between the Pixel 3a XL and its more expensive Google sibling. At 6.3 x 3 x 0.3 inches, the 3a XL is only marginally taller than the Pixel 3 XL, and the phone's share Google's signature two-tone design. The Pixel 3 XL does pack in more screen real estate than the budget model — 6.3 inches to the 3a's 6-inch screen — because the 3a features chunkier bezels. On the bright side, no notch, at least.Once you hold the Pixel 3a in your hand, though, it's a little easier to detect where Google was able to save some money on this phone. The Pixel 3a is made out of polycarbonate instead of metal, and the feel in your hand is noticeable. The glass back of the 3 XL has a bit more heft to it — it outweighs the Pixel 3a XL by a little more than half-an-ounce — but you’ll only notice that when you pick up either phone. When I’ve got them laying face down in front of me, as I have for the last few days, I will occasionally reach for the wrong Pixel.There’s a sacrifice to be made with the Pixel 3a XL’s cheaper plastic casing: it means the new phone can’t charge wirelessly like the Pixel 3 XL can. Still, if you’re worried about settling for a cheap-looking device, the Pixel 3a XL passes the eyeball test with ease.You have three color options for the Pixel 3a XL, and two of those are standard Google choices — Just Black and Clearly White. The 3a XL adds a Purple-ish option to the mix, and while my colleague Mark Spoonauer favored it in his hands-on time with the smaller 3a, I find the light purple hue a little too subtle for my tastes. I do like the Google touch of adding a splash of color to the power button — it's orange on the Clearly White model and lime on the Purple-ish version.Google dropped the 3.5mm headphone jack from recent Pixels, a move that's actually more divisive than any notch designs. Thankfully, the jack returns to the top of the Pixel 3a XL, which will likely increase the phone's appeal. I certainly appreciated the option to attach wired headphones and charge at the same time when I plugged in a set of Apple’s EarPods to rock out to music. (What? Google doesn’t include any headphones in the Pixel 3a XL box.)DisplayThe screens on Google's phones aren't renowned for their brightness, and unfortunately, that trend continues with the 6-inch Pixel 3a XL. I watched some Champions League highlights in the bright sun at Google's I/O developer conference, and it was hard to make out the distinctive red jerseys worn by Liverpool. (Barcelona's obnoxious day-glo away shirt was easy to pick out despite the glare.) That was with the screen set to maximum brightness, so I would expect a pretty low reading once I have the chance to measure the screen's brightness with a light meter.Things only improve marginally when you’re indoors. Watching the Sonic The Hedgehog Trailer on YouTube, Sonic was a bright streak of blue, but any dimly-lit scenes looked murky with details lost in the shadows. When Jim Carey appeared in a black suit, standing against a black background, he looked like a disembodied head on the Pixel 3a’s screen. (This might improve the movie, actually.) The same issue flared up when I watched the creepy trailer for HBO’s upcoming series based on The Watchmen: the trailer is supposed to be dark and moody, but on the Pixel 3a XL, a multitude of men wearing Rorschach masks just looks like an indistinct mess.That wasn’t the case when I watched those same trailers on a Pixel 3 XL, where the dark scenes looked dark, but the blacks looked truer making other details in the shot stand out. Both Google phones use OLED panels, but this may be a case of not all OLEDs being created equally. The Pixel 3a XL’s glass display is highly reflective, and a lot of times when I should have been seeing video, I was distracted by my own face staring back at me.Pixel 3a XL CameraOne area where Google didn't skimp was with the Pixel 3a XL's camera. It's the same single 12-megapixel rear shooter you'll find on the more expensive Pixels. As with those phones, Google is leaning on software and artificial intelligence to do the photographic heavy lifting, and so a lot of the Pixel's more impressive features — Night Sight, Super Res Zoom and Portrait Mode effects powered by computational photography — are on hand in the Pixel 3a XL.Up front, the Pixel 3a XL scraps the second lens Google stuck on the front of the Pixel 3 and 3 XL. That means you won't be able to take wide-angle selfies — helpful when you want to squeeze in more people or capture more background details in your self-portrait. But since dual front shooters are a relatively new addition to smartphones, and generally restricted to more expensive models, I can't imagine budget-minded shoppers will be put off by having to make do with one lens.So the million-dollar question — well, more specifically, the $420 question given the price difference between Google's two XL models — is this: can the Pixel 3a XL's camera pull off the same great photos we've come to expect from the pricier Pixels? Having used both phones side by side, I think the Pixel 3a matches up well against its pricier counterpart.Look at this photo of a plate of scrambled eggs, and you'd be hard-pressed to tell which one was shot by the more expensive phone. Each one offer the same brightly colored vegetables and noticeable flecks of pepper, with a slight overexposure in the upper right corner. The focus is a little deeper on the Pixel 3 XL's shot, but you'd only notice that after staring long and hard at both photos.The Pixel 3a XL pulls off features such as Night Sight just as capably as the 3 XL. This photo of a collection of miniature baseball hats in my unlit office at dusk would be a murky smear if Night Sight weren't enabled, but the Pixel 3a XL and 3 XL both capture the shot, thanks to Google's AI-powered low-light feature. The 3 XL's photo is markedly better — it captures more realistic color, and if you zoom in, you can read the words on the plaques — but the fact that a $479 phone like the 3a XL can capture a decent image in near darkness is still pretty impressive.Testing out a bokeh effect in the Portrait Mode yielded similar results. The Pixel 3 XL's photo is better, and not just because my daughter deigned to look at the camera in that shot. Her skin seems more natural and freckled — a fault of me not adjusting the face-retouching features on the Pixel 3a XL. Also the Pixel 3a XL erased a loose strand of hair that you can see in the 3 XL's shot. But the color, composition and blur in the 3a XL's shot looks pretty good, if not as pristine as what the Pixel 3 XL accomplished.I take the Pixel 3 XL with me whenever I have to photograph something for Tom's Guide. If I grabbed the Pixel 3a XL by mistake, I think the resulting images would look nearly as good.How about when the Pixel 3a XL goes up against another well-regarded camera phone, in this case the iPhone XR and its lone 12-MP camera? I took a photo of the swimming pool where my daughter was practicing, and the conditions were hardly ideal: the sun is setting just off to right of the shot, creating a strong glare on that side of the frame. The Pixel 3a XL tries its best, but the resulting photo looks pretty muted, with the trees in particular looking like indistinct black masses. The iPhone XR wins here, thanks to the Smart HDR feature that captures multiple exposures for more details, even in the shadows.When I zoom in, the iPhone XR maintained only a slight edge. The colors remained a little more true in the iPhone's photo, while the Pixel 3a XL gave everything a bluish cast, even on that white Alameda Gators sign hanging off the back fence. That said, you can clearly read the sign in the Pixel's shot as a result of Google's Super Res Zoom feature, and swimmers and lane lines look less pixelated than they do in the iPhone XR photo.Things even out when we're not staring directly into the sun, though. Either one of these photos of a rose in a public park would make for a perfectly fine shot, with the winner coming down to personal taste. I think the iPhone XR over-saturates some of the color, particularly in the rose's petals, and I prefer how the Pixel 3a XL brings the surrounding leaves and buds into sharper focus. The left third of the iPhone XR's photo also looks a little too washed out for my taste.When it was time to test front cameras, the TrueDepth camera on the iPhone XR seemed evenly matched with the Pixel 3a XL's 8-MP lens. I like the way the XR framed me a little better, and my skin tone looks more appealing in the iPhon'e shot, though I do think the leaves on the lemon tree behind me look a little unnatural, especially compared to the Pixel's more understated colors. The sky in the Pixel photo isn't as blown out as it appears in the iPhone image.Applying a bokeh blur to each self-portrait shows that Google handles such effects with greater aplomb, even in its budget phone. The Pixel 3a XL restricts the blur effect to the background, causing me to pop out of the photo in a more striking way. The iPhone XR takes a different approach, where the blur bleeds into the right side of my face. Also, Apple's phone was either flummoxed by the towel I have draped over my shoulder or it chose to blur that, too; in either case, it's a look I don't care for.Pixel 3a PerformanceThe Pixel 3a XL uses a Snapdragon 670 mobile processor, a less powerful chipset than the Snapdragon 845 which powers most of the leading Android phones that came out in the last year, including the Pixel 3 XL. And our initial benchmarking confirms that you’ll give up some processing power by opting for the Pixel 3a XL and its lower price.On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, we recorded a multicore score of 5,197 for the Pixel 3a XL. As you might imagine, that’s behind the Pixel 3 XL’s result of 7,684; it even trails the 6,282 score we recorded for the Pixel 2, and that phone’s running on a Snapdragon 835.Compare the Pixel 3a XL to phones powered by the same processor class, though, and Google’s phone fares much better. The Moto G7 and its Snapdragon 632 processor turned in a 4,814 result, while the Snapdragon 636-powered Nokia 7.1 scored 4,934. The Pixel 3a XL may not be able to keep pace with flagship devices, but it certainly can match most midrange models.The story is the same for graphics. 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme benchmark is really designed to test the graphics on high-end phones, which explains why the Pixel 3a XL’s 1,628 score can’t really compare to the 4,396 mark that the Pixel 3 XL reached. But the Moto G7 (512) and Nokia 7.1 (950) stumble badly in that high-end test. (Like the Nokia 7.1, the Pixel 3a XL maxes out 3D Mark’s Ice Storm Extreme test, which is aimed more mainstream devices.) The Pixel 3a XL should be able to handle more demanding games than many of the phones in its price class.And that bore out when I played PUBG Mobile on the Pixel 3a XL. Running the game at its highest graphic settings, I didn’t notice any lag or dropped frames as I sprinted across the battlefield. After I died — a distressingly common occurrence for me in multi-person shooters — I was able to spectate as my teammates carried on with me without the jittery experience I sometimes get on my iPhone SE. Likewise, I was able to switch easily between apps on the Pixel 3a XL, thanks to the 4GB of RAM Google includes with its phone.You only have one storage option with the Pixel 3a XL, which comes in a single 64GB capacity. There's no way to add on storage, but at least all your photos are automatically backed up to Google Photos, so that's one way to conserve space on the phone.BatteryA bigger screen requires a bigger battery, and Google has gone with a 3,700 mAh power pack for the Pixel 3a XL. For context, that's larger than the 3,430 mAh battery in the Pixel 3 XL, so you would hope that Pixel 3a XL will improve upon the lackluster 9 hour, 30 minute result that the more expensive Pixel turned in on our battery test, which involves continuous surfing over LTE with the phone’s screen set to 150 nits of brightness.And the Pixel 3a XL delivers. When we ran our battery test on the phone, it lasted for 11 hours, 44 minutes, which places it among the longest-lasting smartphones we've tested in the past year-and-a-half. That result is 15 minutes behind the Pixel 3a's time, which is a little puzzling since that phone has a smaller 3,000 mAh battery.At no point in using the Pixel 3a XL did I have to worry about having to find an electrical outlet. I ran an unofficial battery test using Verizon's network — our official test tries to use T-Mobile so that we can have comparable results — and even though I started the test at dinner time, the Pixel 3a XL was still running when I had the breakfast the next morning. That result may not be official, but it's a pretty good indicator that you can make it through the day without needing to charge your Pixel 3a XL.When it's time to recharge the phone, Google says that 15 minutes of charge time will give you 7 hours of battery life. Again, my experience suggests that Google’s not pulling your leg: I plugged the phone into charge with the battery indicator at 35%, and it was back to 56% 15 minutes later. After my battery test depleted the Pixel 3a XL’s power, 15 minutes of charging got the battery indicator back to 22 percent.Software and special featuresThe Pixel 3a XL ships with the Android 9 Pie, the latest version of Google's mobile OS. Because Google promises three years of security and software updates for its phones, that means you'll get Android Q when that update arrives later this year.You can also expect the other software features that highlight Google's more expensive phones. That includes Call Screening, a feature Google introduced last year where the Google Assistant intercepts calls and deals with robocalls on your behalf. Speaking of the assistant, you can use the Pixel 3a XL's Active Edge feature to summon Google's digital helper by squeezing the sides of the phone, just as you can with the Pixel 3.Bottom lineWhile we still need to complete some display and battery testing, I’ve seen enough of the Pixel 3a XL to recommend Google's latest as a low-cost alternative for fans of big-screen phones. The two most important things that a smartphone can provide are a good camera and long battery life. The Pixel 3a XL delivers on both counts, with pictures that look nearly as sharp as what you get from Google’s more expensive Pixels, while also lasting longer on a charge.You’ll make some sacrifices. The design is fairly pedestrian, especially in this era of edge-to-edge screens, and I was disappointed by how dim the OLED panel is on the Pixel 3a XL. But one of the biggest compromises Google made — a slower processor — won’t really impact the vast majority of smartphone users. You certainly won’t notice $320 to $420 worth of difference in how this phone runs compared to the Pixel 3 and 3 XL.The Pixel 3a XL isn’t a flagship rival by any means. But for $479, it doesn’t have to be. By delivering on the important things you really want from a smartphone, it’s a viable option if you’ve had enough of paying top dollar for your mobile device but don’t want to resort to a bare-bones phone just to save some money.Image Credits: Tom's Guide"
148,Sony Xperia 10,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-xperia-10-plus,review-6383.html","For 2019, Sony is reinventing its Xperia lineup — again. In a departure from last year's XA2 series, the company is outfitting its latest midrange handsets, the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus, with narrow and tall displays that adopt a cinema-like 21:9 aspect ratio when used in landscape mode.That probably sounds like a gimmick, but it's actually the greatest thing about these devices. With a 21:9 screen, you can see more, when reading or watching certain videos, or do more, when you're flipping between tasks and running apps side by side.  Unfortunately however, everything else — from the unreliable cameras to the so-so battery life and abysmal performance (particularly in the case of the cheaper Xperia 10) — ultimately destroys any shot Sony's latest midrange offerings have at landing on our best smartphones list.Price and AvailabilitySony's new midrange handsets come in two flavors for 2019: the 6-inch Xperia 10 for $349 and the 6.5-inch Xperia 10 Plus for $429. Both are compatible primarily with GSM networks, though they're also certified to work on Verizon. There's only one configuration of each, with 64GB of onboard storage.Both the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus are available in a range of colors, though not every option will be sold in all territories. In North America, only black and silver are on offer for both models. However, other regions will receive pink and navy, too.Sony Xperia 10 and 10 Plus SpecsDesign: Pretty and pretty quirkySony's smartphones have always had a hyperminimalist design, and the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus are no exceptions. The two handsets are identically styled — save for the difference in size — and employ the same extra-tall 21:9 aspect ratio, Gorilla Glass 5, aluminum unibody chassis and side-mounted fingerprint sensors.If it weren't for their narrow proportions, the Xperia 10 duo likely wouldn't stand out in a police lineup of midrange devices. However, these are still refined and attractive smartphones in that classically Sony way. I appreciate the company doubling down on aluminum when rivals are pumping out increasing numbers of cookie-cutter handsets clad in cheap-feeling glass. Additionally, the fit and finish of the Xperia 10 lineup is exceptional, lending a sense of quality to a segment of the market that rarely sees it.The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus are still refined and attractive smartphones in that classically Sony way.However, these phones look a bit strange at first glance, not only because of the elongated aspect ratio, but also because of how low their screens are positioned. The side and bottom bezels are all slim and fully consistent, but the top bezel is quite thick. Clearly, Sony had to find space to shoehorn in that display driver somewhere, and we wouldn't call the decision a deal breaker by any means. It has left both handsets feeling quite top heavy, though.Sony fitted the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus with NFC for mobile payments, and thanks to the inclusion of the 3.5-millimeter jack, neither phone will force you down the path of USB Type-C or Bluetooth headphones just yet. At the bottom edge is a pair of grilles that seem like stereo speakers, though only one of them actually fires any sound. At least they look nice.MORE: Best Smartphones - Here Are the 10 Best Phones AvailableStrangely, Sony has returned to the fingerprint-sensor-in-the-frame motif that the company spurned in the Xperia XZ2 and XZ3 last year. The module works perfectly well, which is actually no small feat considering that Sony used to disable the feature for U.S.-bound phones for reasons it never fully explained.However, the Xperia 10 line breaks out the sleep/wake button into a separate key above the scanner, which consequently leads to a somewhat nonintuitive user experience. Before I learned the proper muscle memory, I kept pressing deeper onto the sensor to wake each device — as I would do with Samsung's Galaxy S10e — only to be met with no response.Display: More than a gimmickSony has fully bought in to the cinema experience with the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus. The two devices each employ an LCD display, with the same 21:9 aspect ratio and 2520 x 1080 resolution.The unique proportions of these phones may seem like mere gimmickry, but there's a fair bit of practical merit behind the design. For one, having a panel that's taller in portrait orientation really helps when you're scrolling through web pages, apps and text-heavy content in general. When watching a video, switching to landscape can yield a more immersive experience — if the content being watched employs the same aspect ratio, that is.The Xperia 10's cinema-wide display may prove its worth — provided you can find content that supports it.That caveat is key, because you're unlikely to encounter lots of 21:9 content on YouTube, for example. If you watch a lot of feature films on your phone on Netflix, however, the Xperia 10's cinema-wide display may prove its worth.Watching Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I felt as though I could see much more of the action as Star-Lord bobbed and weaved through enemy fire amidst the commotion of an epic space battle. It definitely helped that the colors were on point, as well, as both new Sony phones sport excellent color reproduction, sharpness and brightness. Those qualities really made the laser beams and explosions pop against the galaxy's darkest depths.Both phones put up strong numbers across the board. The 6.5-inch Xperia 10 Plus led the 6-inch Xperia 10 on brightness, with a peak of 523 nits compared to the smaller phone's 501 nits. For reference, the Moto G7 gets up to 445 nits, which isn't poor by any means.MORE: Apple's iPhone XS Max Has the Best Smartphone Display EverCoverage of the sRGB color space was also satisfactory in both Sony devices, reaching 108 percent on the 10 Plus and 128 percent on the Xperia 10, while each was turned to the default display profile. Those who prefer more-saturated images can always switch to the Super Vivid option.Finally, the Xperia 10 duo posted accurate hues, as evidenced by the Delta-E scores of 0.55 and 0.54 for the Plus and standard variants, respectively. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) Both Sony handsets were slightly outclassed by the $299 Moto G7 and $349 Nokia 7.1 on colors, however, which led the pack with Delta-E scores of 0.34 and 0.33.Cameras: Double troubleThe Xperia 10 and 10 Plus both come equipped with dual-lens rear cameras and have the same 8-megapixel, front-facing camera, though that's where the similarities end.The regular Xperia 10 pairs a 13-MP, f/2.0 primary lens with a 5-MP secondary one for depth. The Xperia 10 Plus replaces that 13-MP shooter with a 12-MP one, albeit with a larger, f/1.8 aperture to let in more light. And instead of that measly 5-MP camera on the side, the Plus model gets an 8-MP telephoto — a rarity in a midrange phone.Sony makes the majority of image sensors used in smartphones, which certainly inspires a lot of hope for the Xperia 10 family's imaging capabilities. And yet, even in ideal scenarios, these handsets rarely produce anything appreciably better than what you get from other similarly-priced offerings.The Xperia 10 Plus got off to a strong start, rendering this cluster of flowers in New York’s Bryant Park with a warmth that was plainly lacking in the Moto G7’s attempt. I also like the nuance the 10 Plus exhibited with respect to the colors and contrast; Motorola’s handset dabbles exclusively in washed-out blues and whites within the flowers’ petals, whereas Sony’s shooter captures all the shades of lavender in between, and nails the lush greens underneath.However, things unfortunately began to fall apart for Sony when the Xperia 10 churned out this bleak, desolate-looking shot from the edge of the park. The buildings, grass and street-level details are far too dark, while the sky is blown out and lacking in any depth. The G7 hardly fared much better, delivering a softer shot with a strange blue-green cast — though at least it was more brightly exposed, and you can see everything a bit more easily.Given that the Xperia 10 Plus features a telephoto lens in support of the phone's primary 12-MP shooter, you would expect that device to excel in portraits. As it turns out, that telephoto is great for optical zoom, but Sony's abysmal Bokeh mode makes it impossible to get a decent shallow-depth-of-field photo with this phone. The Xperia 10 Plus was never satisfied with how I framed things; it always told me the scene was too dark or that I needed to get closer to the subject, even when my colleague Caitlin's face was already filling the shot. I tried multiple times to use the feature, indoors as well as outside, yet the device could never get the subject in focus.With that said, I had to forgo Bokeh mode for the shot I did eventually get of Caitlin, in the foyer of the Tom's Guide office. And while I'm not happy with this portrait, I was equally let down by the Nokia 7.1's best work. Both devices painted overly soft photos, but the Xperia 10 Plus smoothed over Caitlin's skin and struggled to rein in the light from the window, which is a bit overbearing. The image from the Nokia is also a bit cooler, which is probably a bit truer to the spot's actual conditions.As for the front-facing cameras in these Sony devices, they're identical. That means you don't have to worry about missing out and capturing inferior selfies with the less expensive Xperia 10. Both phones have a habit of doing strange things with portraits, generally over-smoothing the subject's face, even when all of the beautification settings — like skin brightening, blemish reduction, slimming and eye enlargement — are turned off. The G7's slightly crisper selfie fares a bit better in that regard, though the harsh shadows Motorola’s handset threw in are hardly flattering.Performance: Just not good enoughAt $349 and $429, the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus aren't what you'd call cheap for midrange phones. In fact, you could make the argument that the Plus, in particular, isn't too far off from the $579 OnePlus 6T, which sports a flagship-caliber processor, in the Snapdragon 845, and an AMOLED screen.Given the prices of these phones, then, you might expect Sony's renewed midrange line to raise the performance bar for its category. Which makes it all the more confounding that the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus aren't merely mediocre to use; they're downright infuriating at times.MORE: Smartphone Buying Guide: 9 Tips for Finding the Right PhoneTo be clear, the larger, more expensive Xperia 10 Plus offers serviceable performance. Sometimes, it doesn't feel quite as buttery smooth as the Nokia 7.1, even though it sports a Snapdragon 636 chipset, just like the Nokia device. But by and large, this is a device you can live with, which won't show its weaknesses in an obvious way outside of when you're playing certain games.The smaller Xperia 10, however, is a different beast. The Snapdragon 630 CPU in this model is a nearly 2-year-old chip. It was the least powerful of Qualcomm's 600-series processors released that year, and it shows its age in almost every facet of the Xperia 10's user experience.The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus aren't merely mediocre from a performance standpoint; they're downright infuriating at times.Basic UI animations, like when opening the app drawer or pulling down the notification shade, often stutter unexpectedly. That's especially likely when you return to the home screen after exiting an app. Occasionally, the keyboard will take a second too long to pop up after you've tapped a text field, and then it will fail to respond to the first couple key presses.With all of those hiccups, I expected the Xperia 10 to be absolutely in over its head when I played a round of PUBG Mobile. To the phone's credit, it delivered a playable experience at the very least on the game's lowest graphical settings. The device still dropped frames at various times, and the back of the phone got very hot to the touch, but at least it hung in there.The numbers really say it all. The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus turned in scores of 2,422 and 4,794 during the system-wide Geekbench 4 test, compared to the Nokia 7.1's showing of 4,934. The Nokia also eked out an advantage in graphics testing, notching a score of 950 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test, while the Sony duo achieved 807 and 946 for the smaller and larger models, respectively.If these phones were less expensive, the performance deficiency wouldn't be quite so egregious. But the Moto G7 Power, which is more powerful than the Xperia 10 and a hair less capable than the 10 Plus, costs just $249. Why spend so much more for so less?Battery Life: Middle of the roadIf you're looking for long battery life on the cheap, you'd better look somewhere else. The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus don't have particularly large batteries, and they proved as much in our battery test. That's disappointing, because so many past Sony devices have been among the longest-lasting phones we've tested .The Xperia 10's 2,870-mAh power pack was good for only 8 hours and 5 minutes of website streaming over T-Mobile's LTE network. The 10 Plus, with its slightly larger, 3,000-mAh unit, only endured 41 minutes longer.MORE: Smartphones With the Longest Battery Life - A ComparisonThose results are comparable with those of rivals, like the Nokia 7.1 (7:41) and Moto G7 (8:50). They're absolutely blown out of the water, however, by the 15 hours and 35 minutes the Moto G7 Power delivered. And more-expensive premium handsets, like the OnePlus 6T, typically hover between 10 and 11 hours. At least Sony's handsets support USB Power Delivery for faster charging, taking the Xperia 10 Plus from zero to 40 percent in 30 minutes.Software: Simple and straightforwardSony's always exercised a light touch on Android for its phones' software, and that's still true on the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus. Both handsets ship with Android 9 Pie and feature Google's gesture-based navigation scheme out of the box. And if the company's strong track record regarding updates is any guide, the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus should receive Android Q relatively shortly after the updated OS launches later this year.That's not to say Sony hasn't made some additions where it's seen fit. The Xperia 10 and 10 Plus implement an optional shortcut panel called Side Sense. Originally launched on the Xperia XZ3, Side Sense functions almost like the Apps Edge pullout on Samsung Galaxy devices, though you access it by double tapping a specific portion of the left or right side of the display. Side Sense was a pain to use on the XZ3, with its finicky, touch-sensitive edges, but I'm pleased to report that the experience is much better on these less expensive devices.When running apps side by side on these phones, the process was functionally unchanged from typical Android behavior. However, the experience is much better because of these devices' 21:9 displays. I'm not typically one to use apps in split-window mode, but I found myself trying it more often with the Xperia 10 devices, in both portrait and landscape orientations.MORE: The Best Phones for GamingUnfortunately however, not all content can take advantage of the unique proportions in the same way. When gaming, for example, your luck will vary. Some titles, like Asphalt 9, fill the entirety of the screen. However, Real Racing 3 and PUBG Mobile remained in 18:9 mode, leaving an awfully massive bezel at the bottom of the screen.Bottom LineThe Xperia 10 and 10 Plus appear to be well-built midrange phones with a useful quirk in their unique screen sizes and pleasant software experiences. If only their performance were as good as their looks.Alas, these devices are far too pricey for their occasionally maddening performance, uncooperative cameras and middling battery life. If the $349 Xperia 10 and $429 Xperia 10 Plus hit all their marks, it wouldn't be difficult to justify their cost. But rival devices — like the Nokia 7.1, Moto G7 and G7 Power — offer at least the same, if not far better capabilities for anywhere from $50 to $130 less. So, you really can't make a case for Sony's latest. And as much as I'd like to say, ""Maybe next time,"" at this point, Sony has all but run out of chances.Credit: Tom's Guide"
149,Moto G6,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-g6,review-5455.html","The $249 Moto G6 is another entry in a line of extremely well-rounded budget smartphones that make you second-guess paying $700 and up for a flagship. You get a colorful 5.7-inch display with minimal bezels, solid performance from a Snapdragon 450 processor and software features that are handy instead of gimmicky.However, despite yearly gains in performance and display quality, many of the same shortcomings that have dogged Motorola's earlier budget offerings remain with the Moto G6, including camera quality. The result is still another great choice among midrange rivals, but one that hardly pushes any boundaries for the segment.Price and AvailabilityThe Moto G6 costs $249 both unlocked and through carriers, including Verizon (where it's actually a bit cheaper, at $240) and prepaid services like Republic Wireless. For that price, you'll get 32GB of storage paired with 3GB of RAM. A microSD slot lets you expand space for additional apps and media, but the phone won't accept anything beyond a 128GB card.The Moto G6 comes in three colors — Black, Deep Indigo and Blush — and works on both GSM and CDMA networks. That means subscribers to all four major networks can use the device, a rare feat for an unlocked handset.Interestingly, Motorola has opted to sell only the standard G6 and lower-end G6 Play in the U.S., while the bigger G6 Plus will not be available in the States. Last year, the G5 Plus and G5S Plus were offered stateside, though both the G6 and G6 Play actually have larger screens than last year's Plus models.MORE: 15 Cheap Android Smartphones (Under $200) Ranked Best to WorstDesign: Perfect size, imperfect materialsThe Moto G6 is a polarizing concoction of metal and glass. On one hand, the phone is perfectly proportioned, with a curved form that effortlessly nestles itself into your palm and small bezels that put the new 5.7-inch, 18:9 screen at center stage. On the other hand, it can't help feeling a little chintzy compared to the G5 Plus.The slight cheapness comes from the slab of Gorilla Glass 3 shielding the back of the G6. The G5 Plus employed aluminum, which not only lent a more premium feel but also made the handset more durable. The switchover to glass could help with network connectivity, but the G5 Plus seemed to have no issues picking up a signal, so it's tough to definitively call this a worthwhile trade-off. Of course, many high-end phones use glass, but there's a hollowness to Motorola's application here that doesn't instill confidence.Ergonomically speaking, this is the most comfortable and sensibly sized smartphone this side of the Galaxy S9. The display is just as large as it needs to be, but the handset is still easy to use one handed. Better yet, Motorola smartly left just enough room in the bottom bezel to keep the fingerprint sensor on the front. That allows for the option of one-button navigation instead of the typical Android on-screen controls — something Motorola's been doing for the last few years, well before Google unveiled its plans to introduce gestures with Android P.Motorola has transitioned from the micro USB in previous budget devices to USB Type-C in the G6. Fortunately, the company didn't use that opportunity to eliminate the headphone jack, which remains situated next to the charging port on the phone's bottom edge.MORE: Best Cheap Cell Phone Service - Monthly Plans for Under $40The G6 isn't IP-certified for water resistance, though Motorola says it's given the phone a water-repellent nano-coating. That should at least stave off damage from splashes. Disappointingly, NFC once again isn't part of the package, which means you won't be using the G6 to make any payments in stores via the Google Pay mobile wallet.Display: Sharp and colorful (but could be brighter)Extra-wide 18:9 displays have trickled down to budget devices, and so the one in the Moto G6 doesn't bring much we haven't seen from other modestly priced smartphones. The 5.7-inch, 2160 x 1080 LCD panel is sharp enough, with solid color accuracy and average brightness.The Moto G6 re-created 113 percent of the sRGB color space in our testing. That's perfectly adequate for an LCD. If you need a little more intensity, you can use the optional Vibrant color profile, which dials up the saturation. This suited the trailer for the upcoming fantasy-adventure film Mowgli, where the jungles of India popped off of the screen with warmth and lushness.Color accuracy remains a strong point of Motorola's budget phones. The G6 notched a Delta-E score of 0.39, which not only tops results from budget rivals like the $199 Honor 7X, but beats the $820 Galaxy S9+ as well.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowHowever, the G6's peak brightness failed to impress when we measured the display with our light meter. At 413 nits, Motorola's phone was just below the 433-nit smartphone average. By comparison, the G5 Plus turned in 591 nits — impressive given that phone's price, but also one of the brightest panels we tested last year in any handset.Cameras: Just OKMotorola has brought its dual-lens imaging tech to the Moto G6. The main, 12-megapixel, f/1.8 sensor is accompanied by another 5-MP one to enable portraits with bokeh effects. Like the Galaxy S9 with its Live Focus mode, the Moto G6 allows you to change the strength of the background blur after shooting.Motorola has also given the G6's camera Google Lens-like capabilities that allow it to identify landmarks and objects in the frame. The phone also has a document-scanning mode that converts what it sees into editable text.The G6's Smart Camera, as it's called, identified objects accurately in my experience, though it took upward of 20 seconds on average to return results. That's much too long, especially considering Google Lens is available from within the Photos app and surfaces results instantly.Special features aside, the Moto G6's cameras are as close to average as any you'll find at this price. Normally, photos on sunny days are a cakewalk for even the least expensive handsets, but the G6 painted this scene in a park in unrealistically cool tones. The Android One-powered Nokia 6.1, which costs $20 more than Motorola's device (and will be reviewed soon), turned in a shot that was a smidge too warm by comparison, but certainly closer to the ideal.I used this sign to test the Moto G6's selective-focus capabilities, and the dual-camera system did an adequate job of separating the foreground from the background. The detail on the sign itself is also commendable compared to the Nokia 6.1's attempt, which blew out some details and couldn't capture the texture of the surface.Indoors, the Moto G6 turned in a surprisingly balanced low-light picture of a collection of vinyl figures. There's certainly some noise and a fair bit of blurriness, but overall, it's an improvement on the Nokia's relatively dim shot, which allowed some color from the figures themselves to bleed into the rest of the frame.Rounding out the comparisons are a couple of selfies from both phones, where the Nokia 6.1 definitely emerged on top. The G6 appears to have a penchant for overly saturated colors, while Nokia's budget phone kept everything in check, with crisp detail and hues that were realistic, rather than dramatic.If you're in the market for a sub-$250 phone with a better camera, the Galaxy A20 is worth consideration. It's not quite as capable as the G6, but it takes better photos.Performance: Solid for the priceOn paper, the Moto G6's Snapdragon 450 processor might seem like a serious step back from the Snapdragon 625, which delivered an excellent experience in the G5 Plus. However, Qualcomm's latest 400-series chipset functionally equals the power of the older silicon in most use cases, so the difference is negligible.I certainly didn't notice any hiccups switching between apps in the background, exploring my surroundings using Google Maps or juggling an assortment of tabs in Chrome. The Moto G6's result in Geekbench 4, which measures general performance, demonstrated that the new device outperforms its predecessor, if only by a little bit. Where the G5 Plus posted a score of 3,746, the G6 achieved 3,934.Graphics performance was nearly the same in the two phones, because the G6 and G5 Plus use the same Adreno 506 GPU. In 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark (the graphics test we typically use for low- and mid-range handsets), the G6 managed a 12,616 score, while the G5 Plus edged it at 13,862.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeLike the Honor 7X, the Nokia 6.1 or other devices in its class, the Moto G6 is not a great phone for gaming. Sure, it can effortlessly run less demanding titles like Super Mario Run and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. But if you're an avid mobile gamer who needs something that can handle more-hardcore multiplayer games like PUBG Mobile, the G6's choppy framerate and low-detail visuals aren't going to cut it.Moto G6 SpecsBattery: Just OKWith a 3,000-mAh battery and Qualcomm's energy-sipping processor, we expected the Moto G6 to deliver battery life on par with that of its predecessors. The G5 Plus and G5S Plus had similar size batteries and turned in nearly 12 hours in our testing, which consists of streaming websites on T-Mobile LTE.Unfortunately, things didn't go as well as expected. The G6 shut down after just 9 hours and 25 minutes. That's 4 minutes longer than the Honor 7X lasted, but far worse than other devices that cost even less, like Motorola's own $169 E4 Plus with its gigantic 4,000-mAh battery. (And the upcoming E5 Plus will feature a 5,000-mAh battery.)MORE: Cellphone Insurance: The Best and Worst PlansAt least the G6 is relatively quick to charge, thanks to Motorola's TurboPower technology, which provides 6 hours of usage in 15 minutes on the stock adapter. Like most budget phones, though, the G6 doesn't support wireless charging.Software: Now with Android PieThe Moto G6 originally launched with Android 8.0 Oreo, though as of April 2019, both the G6 and lower-priced G6 Play can now be updated to run Android 9 Pie. Although Pie arrived a bit later than many G6 owners probably would have liked, it's great to see Motorola support its budget buyers with the latest version of Google's OS.With the release of Pie comes a wealth of new features, including Digital Wellbeing; Adaptive Battery and Adaptive Brightness, which use artificial intelligence to make your smartphone more efficient; and a host of little tweaks and changes that make Android better than ever. However, bear in mind this is the last and only major update the G6 will see, as Motorola only commits to one year of major software updates for its G-series devices.Outside of the Pie upgrade, the G6 neatly packages all of its exclusive features into the Moto app, where you can find various quality-of-life enhancements that make Motorola's phones a pleasure to use.That includes one-button navigation, which expands usable screen space by moving all the controls to gestures in the fingerprint sensor, as well as popular shortcuts like twisting to launch the camera and chopping to activate the flashlight. Few phone makers understand the difference between gimmicks and genuinely useful features like Motorola does. The lone example of redundancy is Moto Voice, which is functionally a less-capable Google Assistant that can be safely ignored.MORE: How to Reduce Data Usage on Your SmartphoneThe Moto G6 also comes equipped with optional Dolby Audio software, which can be easily turned on or off from the quick-toggle shade. This phone has only one speaker, located in the earpiece, but it's a powerful one that gets reasonably loud. The placement on the front is definitely preferable to a side-mounted speaker, and Dolby's tech actually adds weightiness to music and videos. The bass synth and airy cymbals in Radiohead's ""Burn the Witch"" came across equally distinct, rather than compressed — more than I can say for the experience on my iPhone 7.Bottom LineThe Moto G6 is a great phone for almost anyone — whether that's a young person in your life or someone who doesn't care to shell out a whole lot on hardware. And we really mean anyone, because the G6's dual-band support allows Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and AT&T users alike to purchase an unlocked model with no service commitment and have it work perfectly on their network. That can't be overlooked when the majority of unlocked phones are designed for only GSM carriers.This phone is also an excellent value. For $249, the G6 guarantees decent performance, thoughtful design, easy-to-use software and a perfectly adequate display. Better cameras and longevity on a charge would be nice, but considering the price, these are compromises that most buyers should be able to live with. Motorola's latest budget offering may not be perfect, but it's all the phone anyone really needs.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
150,Black Shark 2,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/black-shark-2,review-6364.html","We buy consoles and PCs built for gaming, so why not buy gaming-focused smartphones, too? This is the philosophy behind some of the past year's most interesting handsets, from the likes of Asus' ROG Phone and the Razer Phone 2. And now, a new contender has joined the fray.You may never have heard of Black Shark, and that's for a very good reason: the company was founded only in 2017. Chinese tech giant Xiaomi owns a 46 percent stake in the firm, though Black Shark is adamant that it and Xiaomi don't utilize the same production lines or research and development personnel.Black Shark's first handset came out almost exactly a year ago and made it outside China only last November, when the phone went on sale in the U.K. and Europe. Now, there's a second device out, and it won't land on American shores either. However, at the low, low price of £479 ($625)  — £50 less than the OnePlus 6T — the Black Shark 2 is a bargain of a flagship handset that might just be worth the frustration of importing.Black Shark 2 SpecsBlack Shark hasn't completely ruled out sales in the U.S., but like many Chinese phone makers, the company is staying out of North America for now. That said, you can import the Black Shark 2 to the States, and it will work on some carriers.T-Mobile is an ideal network for the Black Shark 2, as the company supports Bands 2 and 4, which the Uncarrier primarily relies on for LTE service. AT&T and Verizon also deploy these bands, but to a lesser extent, so coverage may not be as comprehensive on those companies' towers. And don't even think about Sprint, as Now Network subscribers won't have any luck with this bargain gaming phone.The Black Shark 2's design sports the right dash of personality for a gaming phone, without venturing into caricature.Black Shark offers a variety of accessories designed specifically for the company's latest handset, the most prominent of which is a pair of Joy-Con-like game-pad attachments that essentially turn the device into a makeshift Nintendo Switch. Strangely enough, Black Shark will ship these products within the U.S. The controller add-on costs $99, and the company also sells a $39 USB Type-C-to-HDMI cable to throw your games over to a bigger screen (though a standard USB-C-to-HDMI dongle will also do the trick just as well).Design: Game in styleWhen I think of mobile gaming, two devices specifically come to mind: the minimalist, so-spartan-it's-basically-invisible Razer Phone 2 and the flashy, angular and aggro ROG Phone.The Black Shark 2 can almost perfectly be described as a midway point between these two extremes. It's not as utilitarian as Razer's handset, but its chamfered edges and curves make it considerably less juvenile than Asus' offering. In fact, Black Shark's design may be my favorite of the bunch, because it has just the right dash of personality without venturing into caricature.From the front, there's not much about the Black Shark that demands your attention. The 6.4-inch, 18:9 AMOLED display is flanked by a pair of speakers inset within slim top and bottom bezels. The frame is trimmed in a metallic emerald green, which I could honestly do without, though at least it's not extremely noticeable. And there's a fingerprint sensor baked right in to the screen. However, it's of the optical variety, rather than the faster and more secure ultrasonic kind as you'd find in the Galaxy S10. The optical sensor still works well enough, though.At the back of the Black Shark 2, things get much more interesting. The phone mixes matte aluminum and mirrored glass in a way you don't see very often. The manufacturer likens the device's creases and curves to those of an exotic sports car, and I'm inclined to agree. They make the Black Shark 2 quite eye-catching at a time when most phone makers have trended toward making their products less distinctive.The rounded frame and tapered sides lend the Black Shark 2 some ergonomic merit as well. This phone is a bit easier to handle than most devices of this size, even with the slippery cocktail of materials cladding the chassis. And just like every self-respecting example of gaming hardware these days, the Black Shark 2 packs its share of RGB lighting. The logo on the back lights up but doesn't get particularly bright. You're more likely to notice the strips adorning the left and right edges, which glow and dance as notifications roll in.The Black Shark 2 is mostly a design win, though buyers should be forewarned that they'll concede wireless charging in exchange for all that metal. (I can live with that trade-off, though I understand that some won't.) There's no water resistance to speak of, either, and I really regret the lack of a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack, which would have taken the audio experience to the next level.Display: Gimmicks for daysThe 6.4-inch AMOLED panel inside the Black Shark 2 is a welcome surprise, given that most handsets selling at this price feature LCD screens instead. That said, it's best to temper your expectations, as this is merely a good display — not a great one.First off, it's far from the brightest. At a peak of 352 nits, the Black Shark 2 can get only half as bright as the Galaxy S10 Plus, which topped 625 nits in our testing. To Black Shark's credit, though, its device is much cheaper than Samsung's and achieved only 10 nits less than what the Pixel 3 managed.Strangely, the Black Shark 2 can get brighter — or at least, seem like it — under the right circumstances. When playing a game, you can swipe inward from one of the display's top corners to open the Game Dock, which incorporates lots of options for modifying the audiovisual experience when you're gaming. And it's here that you'll find a Game HDR setting, which boosts the luminosity and contrast of on-screen content while selectively lifting dark areas and dampening bright ones.At nearly 14 hours of endless web surfing, the Black Shark 2 is one of the longest-lasting phones we've tested so far this year.The effect is profound, though I suspect that some will find it a bit too saturated. Either way, Game HDR can be used only while playing games. For other activities, the Black Shark 2 offers multiple color profiles, as well as a Video HDR mode, which ratchets up color in much the same way Game HDR does (just for apps, like YouTube), and a Super Cinema mode, which artificially accelerates frame rates of videos in a TrueMotion-style way.I thought the world had collectively decided TrueMotion was a bad idea, but it rears its ugly head again in the Black Shark 2. Thankfully, you can turn this feature off, which I scrambled to do after watching the trailer for the Fast & Furious spinoff, Hobbs & Shaw. With Super Cinema on, certain scenes will just haphazardly move faster. One minute, you're watching a cheesy action flick; the next, a car chase feels like a Keystone Kops two-reeler.Video HDR isn't quite as egregious, though it's important to note that the Black Shark 2's panel isn't actually HDR10-certified. In other words, you just get another layer of cartoonishly pumped-up saturation and brightness, which honestly didn't do the trailer I was watching any favors. Video HDR also seemed to impede sharpness, so it felt as though I wasn't getting the most out of the panel's full-HD+ resolution.Turn off those filters off, however, and the Black Shark 2's display is quite nice. With a Delta-E color-accuracy rating of 0.17, the phone's screen ranks as one of the most true-to-life of any we've tested recently, and on a par with the LG G8 ThinQ. For perspective, the S10 Plus achieved a Delta-E score of 0.29, and numbers closer to zero indicate more-accurate hues.The Black Shark 2's cameras may not be perfect, but they're a step up for gaming phones.Additionally, the Black Shark 2 displayed 192 percent of the sRGB color space when set to its default Cinema profile. The similarly priced OnePlus 6T notched 222 percent, giving that phone an edge in saturation. That said, more and more handsets these days, including the iPhone XS Max and Galaxy S10 Plus, have opted for realism over intensity. Those flagships hovered around 130 percent in our testing, and the Black Shark 2 looks to have found a good middle ground in terms of punchiness.Camera: Some strengthsIn their short history, gaming phones have failed to produce fantastic cameras. And though the Black Shark 2's cameras are far from perfect, they're a step up for the category.Leading the array of two lenses is a massive, 48-MP primary sensor on the back. This shooter incorporates an f/1.8 aperture and pixel-binning technology, which bundles all those megapixels together to produce 12-MP photos with greater detail than you'd typically get from images that size.The main lens did an admirable job of capturing the skyscrapers encircling New York's Bryant Park, especially compared to the Razer Phone 2. That phone, even at its reduced price of $499, is still too poor of a mobile camera to recommend to anyone. Through the Black Shark's 48-MP lens, the grass is greener, everything's a whole lot brighter and the sky is a truer shade of cloudy gray.The Black Shark 2 also includes a 12-MP, f/2.2 telephoto lens. A telephoto is the preferable setup for portraits, as it cuts in and gives you that flatter, pulled-together aesthetic for more-dramatic photos. For that reason, I definitely preferred the Black Shark 2's rendition of this shot of some flowers in the park to what the OnePlus 6T managed. OnePlus' device wrangled a richer shade of yellow out of the flowers' petals, but the Black Shark's attempt offers better isolation and separation between the foreground and background, without the bokeh effect peeking through into the subject.When you're shooting flowers or a person, the Black Shark 2 relies on its AI camera to adjust settings dynamically to suit the nature of the scene. Truthfully, though, this didn't seem to improve the quality of the photos I captured, even in relation to other devices that lack AI scene recognition. The OnePlus 6T delivered a warmer and likely more Instagram-ready self-portrait compared to the Black Shark 2, though I like the sharpness and detail in the photo the gaming phone pumped out.Finally, the Black Shark 2 can lean on its telephoto lens for a 2x optical zoom. This highlights another spec advantage of this phone over the OnePlus 6T, whose secondary lens doesn't incorporate a tighter field of view and thus needs to rely on software-aided digital zoom for close-ups. As a result, the Black Shark 2's shot is a bit crisper than what the OnePlus can obtain. The BlackShark 2 photo is also more brightly exposed, which helps illuminate details in the statue's shadow. However, that seems to have come at the expense of color intensity. The OnePlus 6T once again delivers more of the yellows, purples and greens you look for in a spring scene like this.Performance: Zero compromisesWith a Snapdragon 855 chipset and 8GB of RAM, the Black Shark 2 certainly has the hardware you want in a gaming phone.In case you're still doubtful, though, the benchmarks should put any skepticism to rest. In Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Black Shark 2 hit 11,174 points. That's not only higher than the Galaxy S10's 10,813, but also easily within spitting distance of the iPhone XS' 11,420 result.More important for gamers, however, is 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test. And here, Black Shark's latest offering dazzled, with a score of 5,740. That also eclipsed the S10 Plus' best showing, of 5,648, and handily toppled the A12 Bionic-powered iPhone XS's score of 4,339.Those are impressive results, particularly in light of the Black Shark 2's bargain price. But they don't feel real until you experience how this phone brushes off the most demanding of games. I bounced back and forth between arcade racer Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG Mobile, and as hard as I tried, I couldn't get the Black Shark 2 to break a sweat.MORE: 10 Best Mobile Racing GamesUsing the Game Dock, I raised the performance level to what Black Shark calls Ludicrous Mode — a profile in which all the device's resources are fully diverted to gaming. The phone got warm, but not uncomfortably so. And considering I was playing PUBG at its most power-hungry settings — HDR graphics, with anti-aliasing on and the frame rate at Ultra — I'd classify that as a win.Funnily enough, though, you don't need to use Ludicrous Mode to get that kind of performance. I turned everything down to Level 1, which is designed to maximize efficiency and battery life, and I still never dipped below PUBG Mobile's locked 40 frames per second. But whether you delight in all the nerdy power-management options or not, the Black Shark 2 is equipped to handle any Android game out there right now. And that's what a gaming phone ought to do.    Battery: Endurance champThe Black Shark 2's svelte chassis conceals a large, 4,000-mAh battery. That's the same size as the one inside the ROG Phone and a hair smaller than the 4,100-mAh power pack inside the Galaxy S10 Plus. But this handset gets more out of its battery than either of those devices get out of theirs.The Black Shark 2 lasted an impressive 13 hours and 50 minutes in Tom's Guide's battery test, in which devices continuously load web pages over T-Mobile's LTE network until the phones run out of juice. The ROG Phone made it only 8 hours and 59 minutes, while the S10 Plus — which features the same Snapdragon 855 processor as the Black Shark 2 — lasted 12 hours and 35 minutes. That's a terrific time, and yet, the Black Shark 2 topped it.MORE: Smartphones With the Longest Battery LifeThe Black Shark 2's nearly 14-hour result places the device among the longest-lasting phones we've tested thus far this year, eclipsed only by the 15 and a half hours from the Moto G7 Power. However, the Black Shark 2 is exponentially more powerful than Motorola's budget device, and thanks to Quick Charge 4 support, the Black Shark 2 charges much more quickly, too, reaching 60% in a half-hour.Unfortunately, there's no wireless charging available for the Black Shark 2, but that's a reasonable trade-off given the phone's metal build and low price.Software and Special FeaturesOutside of China, where the Black Shark employs an Android front end similar to Xiaomi's MIUI, the Black Shark 2 features a version of Android 9 Pie that very much seems stock on the surface. However, if you look closely, you'll see a lot of additional features tacked onto the software side of things.Chief among those features is Shark Space. Represented by a mechanical green switch on the right side of the phone, Shark Space instantly pulls you out of whatever you're doing on your phone and sends you to a gaming-focused launcher. At the same time, it clears the device's RAM and silences all notifications.Interestingly, you can't return to the Android home screen — or any other nongaming app, for that matter — when you're locked in to Shark Space. And if you play some games that aren't as popular or well-known, they might not support the Shark Space launcher, so you won't be able to play them that way. This isn't an issue for triple-A franchises, like PUBG, Asphalt or Madden, though it's something to be aware of.MORE: Best Android Games - Top Rated Games by CategoryYou never have to use Shark Space to play games, though. And if, like me, you spend most of your mobile gaming while commuting on some form of public transportation, you shouldn't. Shark Space makes it more difficult to dip out of a game and into something else that may require your attention, but then, that's kind of the point, and perhaps I'm not the mobile gamer Black Shark had in mind.You can control the Black Shark 2's RGB lighting on the back and sides via the standard Android Settings app. Asus' and Razer's handsets have similar lighting but offer far more-extensive options for brightness, colors and profiles to determine when and how those lights come into use. In fact, the lighting inside the logo is quite hard to see unless you're in an especially dark room, though that surely bodes well for battery life.If I have one minor gripe about the Black Shark 2's software, it's that the device I was using clearly hadn't been translated with care for English-speaking users. This isn't terribly surprising, given that Black Shark is not offering this phone in North America quite yet. Then again, the phone is on sale in the U.K., and its head-scratching language is bound to be a little off-putting to those buyers.The worst offender came in the description of a feature called Athletic Mode, which says, ""in the game, follow the sound effect, intelligent play, dynamic lighting effect."" I think I know what that means, but that I even have to guess indicates a problem.MORE: The Best Phones for GamingBeyond software, Black Shark produces a number of gaming-centric accessories for its phones; chief among them is the $89 (£69) Gamepad 2.0 attachment. Unfortunately, Black Shark couldn't provide us with a Gamepad to test at the time of this writing. And although the device's software suggests using the company's snap-on cooling fan while running games in Ludicrous Mode, no such accessory is currently available in Black Shark's store.Even if you don't have the bonus buttons and analog sticks the Gamepad provides, the Black Shark 2 allows you to customize some touch-screen-based controls via the phone's Game Dock. However, not all the options are available to all games. The phone's display actually supports a 3D Touch-like feature in which deep presses can be mapped as another input, though I couldn't find a way to register this feature in any of the titles I played.Bottom LineIf you live somewhere you can buy one, the Black Shark 2 is a solid choice for a powerful smartphone on the cheap, whether you're a gamer or not. Regardless of your thoughts on the design, the build quality inspires confidence, and the Black Shark 2's performance and battery life are first-rate. The camera won't contend with the latest from Huawei, Google or Samsung, but it's good enough for the price.If you live outside the British Isles or Europe, though, the Black Shark 2 becomes a tougher sell. In addition to the headache of importing, there's no guarantee the device will work on your network in all the areas you should receive service.Plus, there are reasonably priced alternatives more readily available in the U.S., chief among them being the $579 OnePlus 6T, though the Razer Phone 2 is also a better deal now that it costs $499. With the Snapdragon 855-powered OnePlus 7 just around the corner, too, it's hard to imagine you'll save a ton of cash by choosing Black Shark.That leaves the Black Shark 2 in a spot alongside the greatest handsets coming out of China today, from the likes of Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. It's a well-rounded phone with astonishing value, but when the market is flooded with so many other great choices that you can own with a fraction of the effort, this device is just not worth the trouble.Credit: Tom's Guide"
151,LG G8 ThinQ,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-g8-thinq,review-6354.html","LG's G8 ThinQ sounds truly revolutionary on paper. The front-facing camera on LG's latest flagship Android phone recognizes the veins in your palms to unlock the device, and uses that same camera to respond to your hand gestures. It sounds wild.But it's not wild. The Z Camera's bold new features are gimmicks that make using the LG G8 harder, not easier. The G8 actually makes me mad: It has a beautiful display, powerful performance and AI-boosted cameras that get the job done. A new Night View mode impressed me more than a similar feature on Google’s Pixel 3. It's definitely better than last year's G7 ThinQ. But by putting novelty ahead of function, the G8 sabotages itself, which is why it doesn't make our list of best phones.Cheat Sheet: What's new in the LG G8 ThinQ?Price and AvailabilityThe G8 ThinQ goes on sale April 11, beginning first with Verizon, and then rolling out a day later on AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. You can preorder the phone now from all four carriers.You can also snag a G8 ThinQ from Best Buy, B&H, U.S. Cellular and Xfinity Mobile. Best Buy is currently offering the G8 ThinQ for as low as $650 unlocked.Prices may vary by carrier depending on promotional offers, but the G8's retail price is $820. This makes it notably cheaper than Samsung's Galaxy S10.LG G8 ThinQ SpecsHand ID: Futuristic but frustratingThe G8 ThinQ’s defining feature is its front-facing Z Camera, an 8-megapixel lens with an Infineon time-of-flight sensor for 3D depth-sensing. This enables a host of new features, including the innovative Hand ID biometric authentication feature and gesture-driven controls, called Air Motion.In theory, Hand ID and Air Motion are revelatory. In practice, they made me want to throw the G8 ThinQ directly in the nearest trash can.Setting up Hand ID is easy enough. The time-of-flight sensor recognizes the veins in your palm, LG said, so you scan your palm twice to get started. But I expected Hand ID to work similarly to Apple's Face ID. The iPhone's face unlocking feature can be a little finicky (for instance, if you're yawning), but doesn't need your face to be at a specific angle or an exact distance away to work. Using the G8 was a completely different experience.I really shouldn't have to work this hard to use a phone, I thought as the G8 display urged me to move my palm down, up, closer to the camera, more to the right. The phone's depth sensor was trying to scan my hand so I could unlock my phone, but I kept missing it somehow. With other forms of biometric scanning, such as facial recognition and fingerprint-reading, you don't have to position your face or finger exactly 6 inches away from your phone.The G8 does offer both a fingerprint sensor (on the back of the device below the camera lenses) and facial recognition. Both methods unlock your phone quickly, and I found myself pressing the fingerprint sensor every time Hand ID failed me again.There is a Hand ID sweet spot, and every so often I nailed it. That spot is 6 inches above the camera and squarely in the center (of the camera, not the screen), although I can count the number of times I got it right on the first try on one hand.Air Motion: More gimmicky than usefulThen there's Air Motion, which uses the Z Camera's sensor to detect gestures and respond accordingly. LG offers limited customization in Settings for what Air Motion can do in specific apps. You can use gestures to answer and end calls, play and pause music on YouTube or LG's native Music and Video apps, open apps from the home screen and take screenshots.But to get the G8 to recognize that you're trying to activate Air Motion, you have to put your hand 2 to 5 inches in front of the camera to wake it up, then make a claw with your hand, then pull the claw back so your hand is 6 to 8 inches away from the camera. Then you can swipe to answer a call, rotate your claw-hand like you're turning a knob to control the music volume, or pinch your fingers to take a screenshot.This is not an intuitive experience. I often forgot to activate the camera first, and would sit in front of the phone making clawing motions with my hand trying to figure out why the display wasn't responding. (This makes a person look extremely cool, in case you were wondering.)To get the G8 to recognize that you're trying to activate Air Motion, you have to put your hand from 2 to 5 inches in front of the camera to wake it up, then make a claw with your hand, then pull the claw back so your hand is 6 to 8 inches away from the camera.A colorful bar appears below the notch to alert you when you've activated Air Motion, which is helpful, but the precise distances required to make any of this work are  inconvenient. I would rather take a screenshot by pressing two physical buttons than by calculating the distance from the camera to my hand and then making a claw and pinching my fingers together. When Air Motion works, it's pretty cool. But it's all just way too much work.Cameras: AI rules, portrait not so muchThe G8's front-facing camera also enables advanced selfie effects, thanks to the time-of-flight sensor. LG says the G8 can fine-tune the background blur with more precision due to the new sensor. Two new selfie effects, Studio and Spotlight, are designed to make your photos look better with colorful backgrounds and natural lighting.Studio portraits are just plain bad. The camera cuts out around your basic shape, but the details around my hair look like someone hastily cut with scissors to add a photo of my face on some weird collage.Spotlight is a little prettier. You can angle the spotlight to create the perfect lighting conditions, sort of like being on a set with a professional photographer. You can also use two sliders to adjust brightness and white balance to make the effect more natural. I wish I could combine Spotlight with Portrait mode to create a truly perfect selfie, like the iPhone XS does, but alas, the G8 doesn't allow it.The G8's dual-lens rear shooter doesn't offer any new features from the G7. Both sport an ultra-wide-angle and standard lens, though the G8's main camera is 12 megapixels and the G7s is 16. The G8 has the same artificially intelligent-powered photography software as the G7 for recognizing objects and adjusting camera settings, and it's mostly great.In this photo of a cast-iron pan of green shakshuka at an Israeli cafe, I used the G8's AI Cam (which remains separate from the default camera in the Camera app). The camera recognizes that it's looking at food and optimizes the settings accordingly to capture a more beautiful image. I compared the results to the Galaxy S10 and Pixel 3, and found the G8's image more colorful, with better contrast on the crisped edges of the pita.In a shot of a blooming magnolia tree against a Brooklyn brownstone, I used the AI Cam again. This time the camera categorized the scene as city. The Pixel 3 eked out a win here with a bluer sky and more contrast between the branches and the blossoms, but the G8 performed capably.Portrait mode is where the G8 loses its edge. The camera can't seem to tell where the subject ends and the background begins, as you can see in this portrait of me against a park backdrop. The G8 confuses the green of the shrubbery with the green of my jacket and brings it all into focus. The Pixel 3's software-based portrait mode better blurred the background and was more color accurate. (LG's smartphone cameras tend to run cool.)LG introduced a new Night View mode in the G8. The G7 offered pixel-binning for better low-light photos, but not a separate setting designed for nighttime shots. We compared the results to the Pixel 3's standout Night Sight mode to see which smartphone reigns supreme.I loved the G8’s Night View, because it gives you more control over the exposure of the image than the Pixel 3’s Night Side feature does. I took an Instagram-worthy shot of a glass of Riesling in my favorite German bar, and decided I didn’t want the shot to be brighter, but I did want it to be warmer, so I selected a mid-exposure with the Night View slider tool. With the Pixel 3, I had zero control over the exposure, so it looks like the dim bar has florescent lighting.In a photo of a statue in a Brooklyn plaza, I again selected a mid-exposure on the G8 to avoid blowing out the statue. Again, the Pixel looks like it’s brightness on steroids, while the G8’s Night View is more natural.Video: Problems with portraitsYou can shoot videos in portrait mode on the G8 thanks to the phone's rear dual lenses, which separate the subject of your video from the background and apply a bokeh effect.Or, at least, that’s what's supposed to happen. Frankly, every portrait video I shot looked awful.You can shoot portrait videos of people, objects or animals. I tried shooting a person, a juggler in Manhattan’s Bryant Park, and an object, a pot of daffodils weaving in the breeze as tourists walked by. The video of the juggler was a disaster: Sometimes he's in focus, but then it would blur him into the background and focus on someone else, even as I tapped his face to keep the camera locked on him. The effect worked better in the video of the flowers, because I was able to get up close and personal.The G8's portrait video mode requires you to be incredibly close to the subject of the video in order to blur the background, and it will often switch between ""portrait mode enabled"" and ""you need to be closer,"" even if you haven't moved while shooting. I can't imagine any candid moment I'd be able to capture in video portrait mode without getting uncomfortably close to the subject, which makes the G8's new feature more problematic than useful.Audio: Crystal clearOne area where LG has continued to innovate in a useful way is audio. The company took the Crystal Sound OLED technology it developed for TVs and put it in the G8 ThinQ. The effect not only streamlines the phone's design, but also makes it much easier to take calls.LG stripped out the phone earpiece that is at the top of a smartphone and put a vibrator behind the OLED display. This works sort of like bone conduction, amplifying the sound so you can hear the voice on the other end of the line no matter where your ear is. The sound radiates from behind the screen.The company took the Crystal Sound OLED technology it developed for TVs and put it in the G8 ThinQ.I loved this feature when making phone calls, because New York is always so noisy, even when inside. The Crystal Sound OLED was less useful when playing music — it didn’t sound any louder than my iPhone XS. But I'm not one to blast music from my phone anyway; I prefer a high-quality pair of headphones for quieter listening sessions.Design: Thoroughly mehLG streamlined the G8 ThinQ design, although at first glance it doesn't look all that different from last year's G7. The changes are subtle: The rear dual-lens camera array is now horizontal instead of stacked vertically, and LG has eliminated the G7’s camera bump so the lenses sit flush on the device.LG also eliminated the phone earpiece from the top of the G8's screen for an altogether more seamless design (more on that later). But still, all three devices are glassy slabs that sport a notch that can be hidden with a software setting.LG says it reengineered the G8 with a four-side-bending method for a simple, curved feel. The phone is indeed simple and curved, but the New Aurora Black model I tested was plain and completely forgettable. The G8 also comes in Carmine Red and New Morocco Blue — perhaps those shades pack more punch than the basic black.The company used Gorilla Glass 5 to cover the G8's display, and Gorilla Glass 6 on the back. The glass front isn't quite as durable as the back, in my testing. I tossed the G8 in my bag with my wallet, sunglasses case and two other phones, the Galaxy S10 and Pixel 3. When I emptied my purse at the end of the day, the G8's screen was scuffed. The other two phones remained pristine.Display: OLED makes a differenceLG finally embraced OLED for the G-series lineup after years of LCD screens, and the G8's quad-HD+ (3120 x 1440) panel is beautiful.The richness that OLED delivers makes a huge difference from the G7. It's most evident when you apply the software-based bezel under Display > New Second Screen. Trying to disguise the G7's notch with a black bezel was almost laughable, because the black of the notch was a true black. The G7's LCD panel was too bright to pull it off. That's less of an issue with the G8; the black bar hiding the notch is almost the same shade as the notch itself, even with the brightness bumped all the way up. (If you squint hard, you can make out the bezel, but it's definitely not as obvious as the G7's was.)We lab-tested the OLED panel's color accuracy, and it notched a 0.17 on the Delta-E test (numbers closer to 0 are better). The G8 easily bests last year's G7 (0.37) and Pixel 3 (0.44) and this year's Galaxy S10 (0.38). The G8’s panel isn't quite as robust when it comes to covering the sRGB color gamut (135.7%), especially compared with the S10 (208.2%) and Pixel 3 (202%).But still, watching videos on the phone is a delight, even if the notched display isn't quite as immersive as the Galaxy S10's hole-punched screen. I sat riveted through The Joker trailer while Joaquin Phoenix danced on-screen as the titular villain (although that may have had more to do with his performance than the phone).Battery Life: Improved, but not the bestEvery LG phone we've tested in recent years has consistently fallen short of flagship smartphone standards. (See our list of longest-lasting smartphones for a list of those that overperform the norm).The G8 ThinQ edges closer to premium rivals by lasting 9 hours and 29 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network. The smartphone average is 9 hours and 48 minutes, but like the iPhone XS (9:41) and Pixel 3 XL (9:30), the G8 came in under the average.Still, the G8’s 3,500 mAh battery performed better than both of LG's 2018 flagships. The G7 ThinQ (8:35) and V40 ThinQ (8:48) both fell far short of the average.Just because the G8's battery life isn't as disappointing as its predecessors doesn't make it great. The Galaxy S10 (10:19), S10 Plus (12:35) and OnePlus 6T (10:23) all lasted longer than the G8.If battery life is your top priority, the G8 is skippable.PerformanceThe G8's standout feature isn't its design, or its cameras, or the wacky hand gestures LG is hyping. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 chip inside continues to impress, as we've seen in past testing, and the G8 is a better phone because of its cutting-edge CPU's power.On the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance, the G8 hit a multicore score of 10,958, topping even the Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus (10,813 and 10,782, respectively). The G7's Snapdragon 845 processor and 4GB of RAM impressed us last year with a score of 8,566. The G8 blows away the Android competition.We put that to the test in real life with rounds of Asphalt 9 races, opening up a ton of apps and putting the G8 through its paces. The phone never struggled or felt warm to the touch.The iPhone XS remains the top performing smartphone, thanks to its A12 Bionic chip hitting 11,420 on Geekbench. But the G8 impressed us.Bottom LineI wanted to like the G8 ThinQ, after being thoroughly unimpressed by the G7 ThinQ and the V40 ThinQ.But while other companies are doing really cool things with camera software (Google), displays (Samsung), hardware design (Huawei) and services (Apple), LG just introduced two features that actually make it harder to use your phone.The depth-sensing front-facing camera doesn't take better selfies than a standard lens, and the battery life is underwhelming compared with the other flagships released so far this year. And with LG's V50 ThinQ on the horizon — which will deliver 5G connectivity, triple-lens camera and giant battery in one sleek package — the G8 ThinQ feels like a gimmicky phone without a purpose.I appreciate what LG is trying to do. I just wish the execution was as good as the idea.Credit: Tom's Guide"
152,ZTE Blade Max View,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/zte-blade-max-view,review-6095.html","The Blade Max View is sold unlocked with support for most wireless networks, including Verizon. It's not a bad value for a handset with a 6-inch, full-HD display and a massive 4,000-mAh battery, especially if you can find the phone on sale. The Blade Max View is good enough to make our best cheap phone list. However, some odd software quirks, just average performance and frustrating design decisions hold this handset back.With a matte soft-touch back and a gunmetal-silver frame, the Blade Max View has an unassuming elegance about it. It's not particularly attractive, even among budget handsets, but it's not garish or offensively cheap, either. It's solid, and it gets the job done.Despite the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display, the Blade Max View retains a prominent bottom bezel, which looks quite empty given the lack of a front-facing fingerprint sensor. Instead, that scanner is on the phone's back below the camera, where it carves a deep recess into the plastic and is encircled by a sharp metallic ridge that scrapes your index finger as you try to locate it. It's not a great feeling.In fact, the whole the back of the Blade Max View doesn't feel great, and it's down to that soft-touch texture. I have nothing against plastics on phones when done right, but this material approaches a nails-on-chalkboard grittiness that just doesn't feel pleasing to the touch. It's also prone to trapping lint as well as the oils from your hands and gets to looking pretty dirty pretty quickly.Aside from those complaints, the Blade Max View cleans up nicely. It does feel a bit too tall in the hand, as a consequence of that thick bezel. But given that the device still casts a slim profile, I suspect much of the unused real estate at the front is necessary to contain the phone's gigantic 4,000-mAh battery, stereo speakers and headphone jack.MORE: Best Smartphones - Here Are the 10 Best Phones AvailableNot too long ago, you'd only find full-HD displays with extra-wide 18:9 aspect ratios on the most expensive, premium handsets. But times have changed, and such features have trickled down to devices that cost less than $200.That’s great news for budget-minded buyers, because it means you can nab a cheap phone like the Blade Max View and still get a pretty nice screen. Granted, the panel on the Blade Max View is LCD, rather than the OLED technology today's top-of-the-line handsets employ. Yet details are still crisp, colors are still relatively accurate and the lack of hyper-saturated colors you tend to see on OLED models helps the Blade Max View's battery last a bit longer on a charge, too.Watching the trailer for the upcoming Lion King remake, I was taken aback by the iconic scene overlooking Pride Rock, thanks to the Blade View Max's ability to paint the sunlight and shadows with pleasing contrast and clarity. Some users might have preferred punchier colors, but as far as LCD panels go, ZTE's showing is quite good here.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe Blade Max View turned in a respectable peak brightness of 475 nits under our light meter. That beats out the 413-nit Moto G6, but falls shy of the 510-nit Honor 7X. However, ZTE's handset rendered more of the sRGB spectrum than both of those devices, with a gamut score of 146.7 percent — indicating more robust color. And with a Delta-E rating of 0.36, it was practically dead-even with Motorola's and Honor's offerings regarding accuracy of its hues.The Blade Max View comes equipped with a 16-megapixel primary sensor on the back, as well as a 2-MP sensor for determining depth in Portrait Mode shots. Up front, you get an 8-MP camera for selfies.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shots ZTE's latest budget device churned out. They're very respectable for the handset's cheap price, especially considering low and midrange phones always tend to skimp on photography before all else.The ZTE's rendition of this red model car compares quite favorably to the same shot through the lens of the $249 Moto G6. There are strengths and weaknesses of each photo — the Motorola's result is sharper, while the Blade Max View delivered a brighter shot with more accurate white balance, taking account of the scene's warmth.It definitely became clear in successive shots that the Blade Max View's penchant for more realistic colors wasn't imagined. That's especially evident when comparing these two photos of a homey Christmas tree ornament, where the light emanating from one of the tree's bulbs paints the side of the fox in stark yellow. Again, you;re looking at a more subdued but ultimately life-like shot from ZTE's handset.On this attempt, it was the the Moto G6 delivering the more brightly exposed picture. Motorola's camera turned up the sharpness to 11 as well, which caused a fair bit of aliasing and color bleeding along the wireframe profile of the car on the label. All things considered, ZTE's handset again walks away with the more balanced showing.The results from the Blade Max View's front-facing camera weren't as positive. The focus on this phone can be a little finicky — it already paints photos that aren't quite as sharp as what some of its competitors will provide, and the focal area seems a bit limited. That results in shots like what you see above, where the lower half of my face is properly exposed, but my forehead and hat are considerably blurrier. That said, I prefer ZTE's method of lighting the scene to Motorola's, which, again, tries far too hard to dial in more saturation that necessary.Processing power is usually at odds with price, and the Blade Max View is further proof of that. For $199, you’re getting Qualcomm's Snapdragon 435 CPU — a chipset that is adequate for basic tasks like web browsing, firing off emails and messaging, but quickly finds its limits tested when multitasking or running slightly demanding games.More casual titles like Super Mario Run are well within the Blade Max View's wheelhouse; the phone gets warm to the touch, but the experience is at least smooth. The same can't be said for PUBG Mobile, however, which chugs even at its lowest graphical settings.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesThe Blade Max View's delivered underwhelming results in Geekbench 4, a test of overall performance. There, the device topped out with a multicore score of 2,567 — about 1,400 points behind the Moto G6 and its peppier Snapdragon 450 silicon.The Blade Max View may have its fair share of shortcomings, though running out of juice too quickly isn't one of them.ZTE's latest budget offering lasted nearly 13 hours in our battery test, calling it quits after an impressive 12 hours and 48 minutes. That's several hours longer than the vast majority of devices in its price range, and can be attributed to the device's beefy 4,000-mAh power pack.Unfortunately, one other thing that can be attributed to that massive battery is how long the Blade Max View takes to grab a full charge. We used a few different USB Type-C Power Delivery adapters with the handset, but topping up still took several hours each time.The Blade Max View's efficiency certainly makes the lengthy charging times easier to swallow. However, considering the phone needs a long overnight charge to be usable the next day, it's still not spectacularly easy to live with.There's really no excuse to launch a smartphone at any price with software that's two years out of date, yet that's exactly what ZTE has done with the Blade Max View.ZTE recently pushed out an update to Android 8.1 Oreo, but at the time of review our unit was still running Android 7.1.1 Nougat. And it's not even a clean install at that — ZTE's flavor of Android is stock in some ways, but unnecessarily duplicates most of Google's apps and services. That means you get a second internet browser that is worse than Chrome and strangely can't be disabled, as well as an extra photo gallery and music player that you'll probably never use.The Blade Max View also fusses with Android's UI scaling and typical behaviors in weird and unpredictable ways. While I appreciate the spacious display, maybe quite not so much of it needs to be taken by oversize navigation keys. And who thought it'd be a good idea to replace Android's traditional swipe-up-to-unlock behavior with a press-and-hold?MORE: Best Android Apps - Fun, Secret and Unique AppsConsidering Oreo only just became available, we wouldn't hold out hope for an update to Android 9 Pie during the device's life span. Perhaps ZTE should have just kept things simple and gone the Android One route, as budget phone specialists Nokia and Motorola have done lately to great success.There's a fair bit to like about the ZTE Blade Max View. It has a decent display, lasts pretty long on a charge and provides you with some respectable cameras for what little you're paying.The problem is, that's not really enough to get our attention in a very crowded market for budget phones, where serviceable full-HD LCD screens are not hard to come by, and energy-efficient mobile chipsets typically grant long battery life. If anything, the second point is moot, because while the Blade Max View's ability to sip power is admirable, the tradeoff is relatively poor performance.The Blade Max View does have the benefit of being quite cheap upon launch. But its rivals have fallen in price as well, and all things considered, we still find the Moto G6 and the Nokia 6.1 to offer more well-rounded experiences, with considerably more up-to-date software and a level of quality that is likely to last you a few years longer, too. That leaves ZTE's comeback feeling like a somewhat compelling alternative, though well short of a leader in its class.Credit: Tom's Guide"
153,Honor 7X,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/honor-7x,review-4958.html","The Honor 7X is one of the most underrated phones out there. It packs a fairly speedy processor, a roomy 5.9-inch screen and sleek design, cramming a lot of value into one of the best cheap phones on the market.Yes, the newer Moto G7 packs more power. But, overall, the Honor 7x is a very good bargain.There's only one model for U.S. buyers — a unit with 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM — and the phone comes in either blue or black. Amazon sells the Honor 7x now. The Honor 7X is an unlocked device, though it's compatible with only GSM networks, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket and MetroPCS.Clad in stealthy matte aluminum, the Honor 7X follows and improves on the aesthetics of its predecessor. The device sports curved edges and sloping 2.5D glass, to make for a seamless contour from the face to the back. It's certainly premium-feeling for the price, if a little unoriginal. It's no longer uncommon to see even sub-$200 handsets employ metal over plastic, so as much as I appreciate Honor's reluctance to cheap out on materials, the novelty has worn off a bit.However, the Honor 7X has one advantage you'll struggle to find at this price: an 18:9 display. The 5.5-inch screen in the Honor 6X has grown to 5.9 inches on this new model, and its bezels have been squashed, too. This year has been defined by ""full-screen"" flagships beginning with the LG G6 all the way to the recently released OnePlus 5T, and you've got to commend Honor for bringing the trend to budget-sensitive buyers.It's because of that big screen that the 7X feels more like a cousin of the Huawei Mate 10 Pro rather than any previous Honor device. From other angles, though, the 7X is a mishmash of various slabs.The dual camera calls to mind the Asus ZenFone 4 Max, with its top-left placement and the antenna band running through it. The fingerprint sensor feels small and deeply recessed, but its centralized placement evokes a litany of Android phones. And the drilled speaker holes flanking the micro USB port and headphone jack along the bottom are a hallmark of Apple's mobile devices.But derivative as the look is, it's hard to be too displeased with the design; the Honor 7X feels like it could cost several hundred dollars more than it does, which is really all anyone's asking for in a midrange phone. However, I will take issue with whatever coating was employed on the aluminum chassis. This phone traps fingerprints like nobody's business, and because it's matte, you can't wipe them away with the same ease as you can on the Galaxy S8 or LG V30.The 5.9-inch, 2160 x 1080, LCD screen in the Honor 7X isn't going to set any records for the brightest or most vivid colors, but it doesn't disappoint. The trailer for Avengers: Infinity War looked good on the panel, with solid contrast and good visibility from multiple angles.However, the way Huawei's EMUI interface deals with the nontraditional aspect ratio is a bit strange compared to other devices with 18:9 displays. You have to manually set apps to fit the whole screen — an option that manifests itself as a button above the navigation bar in an app the very first time you open it. Otherwise, they'll display in 16:9 mode. Honor does provide a universal toggle in the settings to display all apps in 18:9, warning that compatibility problems may hinder some apps from displaying correctly. While I suppose this is simply part of the deal as the industry transitions to the wider format, it's an extra and unnecessary step that other smartphones don't concern the user with at all, and rightfully so.When you finally are using every inch of the screen, content does look more immersive. What little bezel there is simply melts away when you're watching video, and in those moments, the Honor 7X really feels three to four times more expensive than it is.Taking a closer look at color, the Honor 7X reproduced 105.5 percent of the sRGB space and notched a Delta-E score of 0.38, indicating realistic and accurate hues. (Delta-E numbers closer to zero are better.) The Honor 7X doesn't feature multiple display modes offering different color profiles, nor does it tout the kind of oversaturation that has become common with many of the latest smartphone displays — so what you see is pretty much what you get.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowFortunately, it's a bright display, too. At 510 nits of peak full-screen brightness, the Honor 7X handily trumps the 433-nit smartphone average. It's not quite as vibrant as the 591-nit panel in the Moto G5 Plus, but outdoors, it's practically just as visible, and Motorola can't match the sheer size of the 7X's screen.It's become more common over the past year to see dual-camera photography pop up in budget devices, but at $199, the Honor 7X still manages to undercut its peers. For that price, you'll get a 16-megapixel main shooter with an f/2.2 aperture, paired with a 2-megapixel secondary lens to aid in taking portraits.Up front, there's an 8-MP camera, featuring gesture control so you can trigger the shutter simply by turning your hand, without ever having to make contact with the device.One of Honor's primary competitors in the budget space is Motorola, and the $279 Moto G5S Plus also touts dual cameras. We took both devices out into the wild to see what you gain and lose with Honor's cheaper handset.To kick off the comparison, I journeyed to Union Square in New York on a cloudy day and snapped these photos at a fruit stand. The Moto G5S Plus set the mark with a more balanced exposure that pulled more detail out of the highlights and shadows. There's a greater range of colors on display compared to the Honor 7X's rendition. That photo reached higher peak saturation with its intense reds and greens, but failed to capture the fine gradations between those extremes.A similar scenario played out as I focused in on one of the produce vendors' signs. On the Honor 7X, the red absolutely pops out of the frame, and the more-pronounced contrast enhances the illusion of depth. It's more dramatic and aesthetically pleasing to my eyes, though I wouldn't call it realistic. The G5S Plus sports a bit more detail in the fabric because it doesn't get quite as oversaturated, though it fails to capture the mixture of gray and blue in the sky.Interestingly, Honor's Portrait Mode appears to be tied to basic object recognition, as I was unable to get the phone to capture shallow depth-of-field shots reliably unless I was photographing a person's face.Honor and Motorola have taken two very different approaches with their dual cameras, and it shows in these images. The 7X features a more aggressive depth-of-field effect that blends the background evenly and does a better job of identifying the boundaries of the foreground than the G5S Plus. That phone struggles near the right side of my colleague Henry's glasses.However, there's definitely room for improvement. While I prefer the 7X's contrast and lighting in the Honor's shot, Henry still appears out of focus and hazy. The G5S Plus didn't suffer from this issue, nor did it blur the text on Henry's sweater, which the Honor device lumped in with the background for some reason. Also, it's worth noting that the G5S Plus allows you to adjust the strength of the blur after you press the shutter, while the 7X does not.Rounding out the showdown with a pair of selfies, the 8-MP front-facing cameras in both of these phones produce noisy and blurry shots. Neither of them is particularly noteworthy, though the Honor 7X's rendition seems a little brighter on the whole.Inside the Honor 7X is a 3,340-mAh battery that the company promises can deliver a little less than a day and a half of life on a charge. I found that to be a tad optimistic during my time with the phone.A particularly active morning consisting of lots of YouTube streaming, picture taking, casual gaming and web browsing left our unit with a little more than a 70 percent charge by noon. That's adequate among similarly priced smartphones, though results from our battery test showed less encouraging results.The Honor 7X delivered only 9 hours and 21 minutes during our test, which consists of endlessly streaming webpages on T-Mobile LTE. That's shy of the 9:40 smartphone average, and puts the 7X at a significant disadvantage against some other budget handsets that last considerably longer, like the Moto E4 Plus and Asus ZenFone 3 Zoom, which turned in times of nearly 15 and 17 hours, respectively.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeWhen it's time to recharge, though, the Honor 7X will leave you waiting awhile. With no fast-charging tech to speak of, our phone reached only 31 percent in 30 minutes connected to the packaged adapter.The Huawei-produced Kirin 659 system-on-chip that powers the Honor 7X is tuned for efficiency rather than all-out power, and it compares quite favorably to the Snapdragon 625 inside the Moto G5 Plus.Equipped with 3GB of RAM in the U.S. model (overseas customers will be able to select a 4GB-RAM variant with 64GB of storage), the 7X delivers swift performance that should satisfy all but the most demanding of power users. Occasionally, when switching tasks and opening notifications, you'll run into lags that you wouldn't encounter on the Mate 10 Pro, but that's to be expected from a midrange phone.While the Honor 7X launched with Android 7.1 Nougat and version 5.1 of the company's own EMUI software experience, the device is now getting its promised upgrade to Oreo. Android 8.0, along with EMUI 8.0, release April 30 via an over-the-air-update for the Honor 7X.Otherwise, this is EMUI as you know it well, and if you're faithful to stock Android, you'll want to avert your eyes. There's nothing egregiously wrong with EMUI; it doesn't slow the phone down from what I can tell. And it does offer a few useful features, like App Twin, which lets you clone apps to tie unique accounts into each one. A modified multi-window mode also makes it a little easier to respond to incoming texts. Simply press the recent-apps key when you receive a notification, and the phone will automatically open certain messaging apps, like the stock SMS client and WhatsApp, in multiwindow mode.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialBut those are outlying cases. Most of the time, EMUI just feels like change for the sake of change. The outdated icons clash heavily with Android's modern Material Design principles, and the garish themes don't help the cause. There are loads of extraneous apps that duplicate core Android software, and even the home screen scrubs the app drawer by default. You can get it back in the settings, but the fact that it's missing for no good reason sums up EMUI in a nutshell.No $200 smartphone is perfect, but the Honor 7X is a jack of all trades not a perfectionist. It's arguably the best balance of design, performance and features in its class, even if its rivals do certain things a little better. The $229 Moto G5 Plus offers a marginally more powerful processor and a faster-charging battery. There's also a case to be made for the ZTE Blade V8 Pro, which features a USB Type-C port and now costs $20 less than Honor's latest.But neither of those phones features an 18:9 display, nor do they offer those shrunken bezels that are all the rage right now. The Honor 7X may have its faults, but if you're looking to get the best bang for your buck, you can't do better than this phone.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
154,Asus ROG Phone,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/asus-rog-phone,review-5865.html","As games like Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds continue to reign supreme on our phones, companies like Asus are betting that consumers will want a smartphone with a little more oomph to handle the influx. Enter the ROG Phone.Priced at $1,099, the ROG is one of the most powerful phones on the market, thanks to its overclocked Snapdragon 845 processor. And thanks to some cleverly placed haptics and a bright, beautiful OLED display and loud audio, it's ideal for gaming or just watching a movie. I'm still not sure if the world wants or needs a dedicated gaming phone, but the ROG Phone is one of Asus' most compelling to date. See all of our top picks for best phones.The ROG Phone's design is definitely polarizing. Made from a mix of glass and metal, the mobile device is  leaning into the whole ""gamer phone"" look. When I passed the phone around the office, my colleagues called it aggressive and over-the-top, words you'd seldom hear used to describe a smartphone. But I think the look is rather refreshing.You get the first inkling that the ROG isn't like the other phones when you take a look at the front. A pair of copper accents breaks up the monotony of the black top and bottom bezels. A status light and the 8-megapixel camera sit at the top on either side of the showy accoutrement.The next hint that this ain't your average smartphone comes when you tour the aluminum sides of the device. On the left, there's a proprietary port used to connect all the optional peripherals Asus has created to optimize your gaming experience (more on that later). But if you look a little bit closer at the special port, you'll find that it's actually two ports, one of which is  USB Type-C. The reasoning behind this hidden port is pretty simple — when you're running low on power while gaming, you can connect a charger into that port without it intruding on your gameplay.Slightly raised, the power button and volume rocker reside on the right. On the bottom, there's another USB Type-C and a 3.5 millimeter audio jack.But the show really starts when you flip the phone over. The glossy Gorilla Glass' space-gray panel is bold and futuristic and bursting with geometric design, from the delicate silver lines at the top to the polygonal shapes housing the dual 12MP cameras. Hell, even the LED flash's casing is a funky parallelogram. Directly below is an off-center shiny polygon hiding a fingerprint scanner.The main attractions is the large backlit ROG logo, which, like any good gaming device, is customizable. The other show stopper is the ROG Aerodynamic System, which looks decidedly badass with its geometric patterns etched into the black plastic with two copper vents.At 7.1 ounces and 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches, the ROG Phone, is by no means a small phone or a lightweight, but it's in good company. It's almost the same size as the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (7.1 ounces, 6.3 x 3 x 0.34 inches) and a little heavier than the Google Pixel 3 XL (6.5 ounces, 6.2 x 3.0 x 0.3 inches). At 7.3 and 7.8 ounces, respectively, the Apple iPhone XS Max and the Razer Phone 2 with their 6.2 x 3.1 x 0.3-inch frames are the heaviest devices in the lineup.I'm used to programming lighting on gaming laptops, mice and headsets, but having the ability to program 16.8 million colors for the ROG logo on the back with a quad of effects is a first. The ROG Phone has Asus' Game Center preinstalled, allowing you to tweak CPU clock speed, fan speed and color. When you're ready to start customizing, you just launch Game Center and access Aura Lighting. From there, you can choose an effect (Breathing, Strobing, Static and Color Cycle); depending on your effect, you simply use the slider to pick your color. If there are other ROG Phones in the vicinity, you can sync them to flash and create a mobile light show.While that's pretty cool, I wish there was a bit more functionality baked into the ROG Phone's color support, similar to what Razer's done with the second iteration of the Razer Phone. Razer's Chroma feature allows you program lighting for everything from notifying you about email to signaling if you're taking damage in Fortnite.Big, beautiful color. That's what Asus is serving up with a massive 6-inch, AMOLED display that's both vivacious and, thanks to its 2160 x 1080 resolution, sharp. Thankfully, since the display is made of Corning Gorilla glass, it's as durable as it is pretty. The ROG is also the first phone to use Corning's 2.5D curved-edge glass, which the company claims can survive a drop from 3.3 feet.I was blown away by the sheer attractiveness of the display, compared with the Razer Phone 2. In a side-by-side comparison, my colleagues agreed that not only was the ROG brighter, the color was more appealing. This immediately became apparent as we watched the trailer for If Beale Street Could Talk, and there were audible oohs and ahhs over the actress' golden and emerald blouse that accentuated her clear, brown skin. Details were sharp enough that we could see the springy coils that made up her immaculately coiffed afro.The color cavalcade continued when I played Ark: Survival Evolved as a black and gold dilophosaur charged me. The last thing I saw before the world went dark was the dilophosaur's bright green venom that blinded me. Once it wore off, I chased after a few dodos, admiring their feathered hides before butchering one with my stone hatchet.Those bursts of color are due in part to the ROG screen's capability to reproduce 233.6 percent of the sRGB gamut. Its only close rival is the Note 9, which achieved 224 percent. The Razer Phone 2 produced only 104 percent.For such a vivid panel, the ROG Phone is pretty color accurate with a Delta-E measurement of 0.5, which is much better than the Razer Phone 2's 1.2  (0 is the ideal.). However, the ROG Phone is not as accurate as the iPhone XS Max (0.2), the Note 9 (0.3) or the Pixel 3 XL (0.35).Averaging 538 nits, the ROG Phone is plenty bright and luminous to be used in direct sunlight. It easily outshone the Razer Phone 2 (492 nits) and the Pixel 3 XL (362 nits), but it wasn't a match for either the Note 9 (604 nits) or the iPhone XS Max (606 nits).MORE: The Best Phones for GamingAnd while the display is definitely pretty to look at (and it should be), there's more to the ROG Phone than meets the eye. For one, it has a 90-Hertz refresh rate, which means smoother graphics, resulting in a prettier game overall. Asus claims the screen has a 1 millisecond response time, which, in a game like Vainglory, can mean the difference between landing a killshot. It should be noted that the Razer Phone 2 display has a 120Hz refresh rate.Last year, I declared the Razer Phone  the best-sounding phone on the market. Asus is now right on its tail. I pitted the ROG Phone against the Razer Phone 2 in a sound-off and it was close — close enough that I had to call in a few colleagues to decide.With its default audio settings, the ROG and its pair of NXP 9874 amplifiers easily filled our test lab. And if you need a further volume boost, you can switch to Outdoor mode. However, you'll lose a lot of detail due to the purposeful diffusion.When we listened to Rihanna's ""Work"" on Spotify, we agreed that the bass line on both phones sounded boomy and diffused. However, thanks to the Razer Phone's Dolby Atmos software, it delivered the fuller, warmer performance, while the highs on the ROG sounded a bit tinny by comparison.Wow. Asus just ate Razer's lunch and even put Samsung on notice. Outfitted with a pair of Sony IMX363 sensors, the ROG Phone’s dual rear-mounted 12MP cameras captured images that are both über-vivid and detailed.I took my first shot in our video studio and was impressed with how gorgeous Cappy, the mascot for Super Mario Odyssey, looked. The ROG's shot was on a par with the Note 9 with the richness of the reds and the golden USS Enterprise model. Regarding sharpness, the Razer had the edge, showing of more detail of the brick wall.The ROG stumbled during my outdoor flower shoot, delivering blown-out color and lack of sharpness, particularly in the petal portion of the image. The Razer offered more detail and more accurate color, but the edges of the picture were a bit fuzzy. Although it was a bit dark, I could make out just about every vein in the actual flower petals in the Note 9's pic, and while oversaturated, several of my colleagues preferred the darker pinks.For my low-light shot, I took Tom's Guide staffer Adam Ismail into our darkened lab. I was impressed with each camera's ability to pick up as much color and detail as they did. However, the Note 9 was the victor, delivering the most accurate skin tone as well as the best detail. Unlike the Razer, Adam's beard didn't look like it had been sketched on, and I could zoom in a few times without encountering digital noise, which is something I couldn't do with the ROG Phone.I snapped a few selfies with each of the phones, and the ROG's 8MP shooter gave the best result. Not only did my skin tone look great, but the window in the background wasn't blown out, and you could make out more detail in my sweater.No, the ROG Phone isn't the first to use a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM. But it's definitely one of the first to use a speed-binned CPU. Speed-binning is the process of testing identical parts to reach a certain standard. In this case, the threshold is that four of the 845's eight Kryo performance cores can run at a clock speed of 2.96-GHz simultaneously, which is notably higher than the standard 2.8-GHz. In other words, either Asus or Qualcomm tested the chips to make sure they could run and maintain overclocked speeds.So, fancy jargon aside, what does that mean for you? Pretty powerful performance, that's what. The ROG Phone might be one of the most powerful smartphones outfitted with an 845 CPU. We ran Geekbench 4 to measure overall performance, and the ROG Phone scored 9,224. The Razer Phone 2 and the Pixel 3 XL hit 8,903 and 7,684, respectively. It's impressive, but nowhere near the XS Max's A12 Bionic processor, which scorched the competition at 11,515.The ROG also held its own during real-world tests, taking 3 minutes and 31 seconds to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. That's faster than the Razer Phone 2 (3:59), but not enough to outpace the Pixel 3 XL (2:42) or the XS Max (0:39).MORE: The Huawei Mate 20X Is a 7.2-Inch Monster Gaming PhoneAlthough overall performance is important, the ROG is a gaming phone, so it needs to deliver on the graphics front. And it does. The phone's Adreno 630 GPU managed to overtake the mighty XS Max (4,339), achieving 4,757 on the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme 3.1 benchmark. The Note 9 came the closest to matching the ROG at 4,639, but the Razer Phone 2 wasn't too far behind with 4,621. Meanwhile, the Pixel 3 XL reached 4,396.Remember when I said those copper-colored vents on the back of the ROG Phone were there for more than show? Well, they're a part of Asus' GameCool system. If you could open up the phone, you'd find a 3D vapor chamber along with a couple of heat spreaders and cooling pads — all so that the overclocked processor doesn't overheat causing the phone's performance to take a hit.And if GameCool doesn't work, you can always attach the AeroActive cooler, which comes bundled with the ROG Phone. Once attached to the middle of the rear panel, a quick notification flashes, letting you know that the newly attached fans might interfere with the audio quality. After clicking Okay, the fans gently whir to life. If you were worried about the accessory covering all that glowing LED goodness, you can lay those fears to rest, as Asus made sure to outfit the peripheral with its own backlit logo.MORE: Best Gaming Deals for OctoberI spent 20 minutes playing Shadowgun Legends sans the AeroActive cooler with the display refresh rate at 90Hz. I got a temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit in the middle of the logo and 100 degrees from the vents. I played for another 20 minutes and could feel the phone getting progressively warmer beneath my fingertips. When I took the temperatures this time around, the center jumped to 102 degrees while the vents hit 108 degrees.So how is a so-called gaming phone different than any other high-end smartphone? The ROG is one of the few phones that has legitimate gamer-centric software. You have Asus Game Center, which is similar to what you'd find on a gaming laptop. This allows you to monitor system specs, including clock speeds and temperature. You also have the ability to adjust the Aura lighting on the rear panel and access controls for the myriad  ROG Phone peripherals. And most important, this is where you access X Mode, which automatically increases the CPU clock speed and optimizes the RAM for gaming.The ROG Phone also comes preinstalled with Game Genie, which lets you disable all alerts, configure the Air Triggers, map keys when you're using a mouse and keyboard andprogram macros. I also liked that I could get real-time frame rate and temperature info as I rounded curves, fought dinosaurs and explored an oceanic landscape.Hands down, my favorite thing about the phone are the Air Triggers. Positioned along the sides of the phone when used in landscape mode, the triggers are four haptic sensors that function as shoulder buttons, similar to what you'd find on most modern game controllers. Once launched, the feature generates a red (left button) and blue (right button) sphere that can be dragged over the functionality you want to map to the shoulder buttons. For example, during PUBG Mobile, I mapped the left shoulder button to jump and the right to shoot, making it easier to gun down my foes. I made it to 31st place out of 100, which ain't too shabby for me.When you're not gaming, the Air Triggers can be used to activate one-hand mode when the phone's locked. When unlocked, a long squeeze can activate X Mode, while a short press acts as the back button. You can also program the Triggers with a variety of actions, such as taking screenshots and launching Google Assistant or any of your installed apps.Those additional features give the ROG a slight edge over other smartphones when it comes to gaming. I definitely appreciated the ability to map buttons to the Air Triggers, as it freed up valuable screen real estate and made playing most games easier. And while I don't imagine most gamers will use it, as a reviewer, I love having real-time performance info at my fingertips.The ROG Phone is equipped with a 4,000 mAH battery, which isn't the largest battery I've seen in a phone, but it's still pretty large. (The Note 9 also comes with a 4,000 mAh power pack.) Still, I was skeptical as to how long the battery would actually last with that souped-up processor.The ROG Phone lasted 8 hours and 59 minutes on the Tom's Guide battery test, which is comprised of continuous web surfing over 4G LTE (T-Mobile) at 150 nits of brightness. It's below the 9:48 smartphone average, but I was still surprised it lasted that long. Still, it was no match for the either the Pixel 3 XL (9:30), the XS Max (10:38) or the Note 9 (11:26).But surfing the web is one thing, quite another to game. I spent 1.5hours playing various games, including Real Racing 3, Vainglory, Oceanhorn and Ark: Survival Evolved. After the allotted time had elapsed, I still had 76 percent of that massive battery life to burn through.I've seen a lot of Android skins in my day, but Zen UI is so gamer it hurts (and not necessarily in a good way). I'm not a fan of the clock font or the slight outlines surrounding the circular icons, but I was still on board with the gray background with the peach tint, and I'm a fan of how Asus matched up the icon color in the notification shade with the copper accents of the actual hardware. I also like the geometric design, as it looks like a futuristic piece of a M.C. Escher drawing. And I'm not sure if anyone needs three pages of icons in the shades, but that's more of my personal preference.Everything went wrong for me once I engaged X Mode. Once enabled, the phone goes from somewhat snazzy to obnoxious. The Escher design is lit up with a reddish-pink light, which admittedly shows  more detail in the design, but also looks kind of gaudy. And those subtle outlines around the icons? Now they're glowing red, pushing the whole design into garish territory. I would have been fine with the small X icon in the top nav bar instead of the unnecessary light show.I reviewed the $1,099 iteration of the Asus ROG Phone, which has a speed-binned Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM, 512GB of onboard storage with an Adreno 630 GPU. If the thought of paying more than $1,000 for a phone, gaming or not, makes your wallet queasy, there's an $899 version that drops the storage down to 128GB. That's still a fair amount of storage, considering the entry-level iPhone XS Max costs $1,099 with only a 64GB capacity.Mobile gaming is convenient, but it's not for everyone. Not everyone wants to hold their phone like a game controller. Plus, touch-screen controls aren't as accurate as a traditional controller and can take up screen real estate. To that end, Asus has created a cadre of accessories, so you can play games in a variety of ways.For instance, you can add a second screen to the ROG with the Twinview Dock ($399), essentially turning it into more powerful (and more expensive) Nintendo 3DS. After snapping the phone into the top half of the dock, the second, bottom-mounted 6-inch, 2160 x 1080 AMOLED display springs to life. Depending on the title, you can play on both screens, using one to navigate the world and the other to keep track of your location on the map. Or you can run a Discord chat or a livestream. When connected to the dock, the phone gains an additional 6,000-mAH battery, which will greatly extend your game time.If you're more comfortable with a keyboard and mouse, Asus has its Mobile Desktop Dock. Starting at $229, the Desktop Dock is pretty straightforward: pop the handset in,plug in all your favorite peripherals, and start gaming. With four USB 3.1 ports, a USB Type-C port, a USB 3.0 Micro B port, an SD card reader, a Gigabit Ethernet and jacks for a mic and headphones, you can create a formidable gaming battlestation. And thanks to the HDMI, DisplayPort and DisplayPort 1.2, the dock will work with both 1080p and 4K displays.MORE: 5 Awesome PC Gaming Gadgets to WatchAsus also has the Professional Dock ($119) for folks looking for a more simple setup. The portable version of the Desktop Dock is a small black box that has only a pair of USB 3.0 ports, a USB Type-C port and an HDMI.If you'd rather not futz around with having to plug in a bunch of wires into either the Desktop or the Professional Dock, you can always stream. Asus partnered with peripheral-maker Gamevice to create a specialized controller ($89) that works with a WiGig Display Dock ($329) so you can stream content with little to no latency. Asus claims the Display Dock boasts latency as low as 20ms. You have to place the phone into a controller shell, but that shell offers dual analog sticks, a D-pad and the usual face buttons.From its bold design, seriously lovely display and impressive performance, the Asus ROG Phone is a bonafide discussion starter. And the topic of said discussion: Does the world need a gaming phone?After spending a week with the ROG, I'm still on the fence. As one of those gaudy ""hard-core"" gamers the company is targeting, there's so much to like about this handset, particularly the speed-binned processor and the incredibly vibrant display. And Asus really took me by surprise with how great the camera on the ROG Phone is.However, when you're asking for $1,099, I would expect better battery life, gaming phone or not. Judging by my colleagues' reaction, not everyone is feeling the design. And after shelling out around $1,000 for a phone, I don't envision too many people forking out even more money for the accessories, especially not for mobile games. Overall, though, the Asus ROG Phone is a great first step into an burgeoning category.Credit: Tom's Guide"
155,Xiaomi Mi Mix 3,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/xiaomi-mi-mix-3,review-6198.html","For smartphones, this is shaping up to be the year of the wandering selfie camera. After the controversial Age of the Notch, lots of phone makers are trying to find ways to keep the front-facing camera's utility without resorting to bezels or sacrificing other areas of prime display real estate.You've got the Honor View 20 punch-hole approach, the Oppo Find X motorized pop-up camera, as well as some phones for which the manufacturers doubled down on the notch, like the Google Pixel 3 XL. But could there be another way? Xiaomi thinks so.The Chinese phone maker has decided to redevelop the slider design from the pre-smartphone era of cell (mobile) phones and use it to give you a completely clean display that still allows a dual selfie camera. Combined with another twin camera array on the back, some powerful memory and processing within and a large screen, the resulting Mi Mix 3 offers great performance for a comparatively paltry £499 ($640). Xiaomi's new midrange phone is largely successful, but because of some of the Mi Mix 3's features, it won't be for everyone.Apologies to our U.S. readers: The Mi Mix 3 isn't on sale in your country, at least outside of imports (and buying imports carries its own set of risks). In the U.K., you get only one model for now: one with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, in either Sapphire Blue or Onyx Black, all for £499.A version featuring 5G compatibility, plus up to 10GB RAM of RAM and 256GB of storage, is promised down the road, but those specs are not available in the current lineup.When you first see the Mi Mix 3, you'll struggle to find a defining feature. The front is flat, apart from a tiny cutout for the speaker, and even the side buttons have slim profiles, so they don't complicate the clean design.Once in your hand, this device gives you the smartphone equivalent of a frosty reception, thanks to the Mi Mix 3's cool ceramic back plate. It looks and feels like a high-quality device, but you might feel a little uneasy holding such a slippery-feeling phone.If you're not a fan of the ceramic back, then you could use the thin plastic case that comes in the box and clips over the phone's back and top and side edges. This won't protect the device from any fall damage, but it will give you a different texture. More importantly, you can still use the wireless charging feature while the case is on.To reveal the selfie cameras with the slider, push the front downward while holding the back in place. The combination of the sliding mechanism and large display makes the Mi Mix a little heavy, at 218 grams (7.7 ounces). That's not going to make your wrists ache like a brick phone from the 1980s would do, but this device is heavier than the 206-gram iPhone XS Max and the 201-gram Samsung Galaxy Note 9. The similarly sized Honor View 20 weighs 180 grams, so the Mi Mix 3 clearly has some heft.Getting the slider to move can be a bit tricky, thanks to a tough spring. However, that means you won't accidentally use the slider. You will have to grip the phone or press down with greater force than you might be used to doing.This feature is certainly fun to play with, just like sliders always were. But the entertainment value alone doesn't mean a slider is a good idea for modern smartphones. It's excellent that you can watch videos on the Mi Mix 3's display without anything covering parts of the screen, but I prefer the punch-hole approach found in the View 20 and likely coming to Samsung's Galaxy S10. The Mi Mix's slider isn't simply bad, unless you are focused on having a very light phone. But I still prefer having an instantly accessible selfie camera even if it means losing a little screen space.The slider feels counterintuitive, at least to me. The slider phones that I and others used many years ago slid upward, revealing the keypad underneath the main body of the phone. The Mi Mix 3 slides downward into your hand, which means you have to relearn how to hold the phone to use the camera.Still, the Mix 3's design isn't completely alien. You've got volume and lock controls on the right-hand edge, a lonely USB-C port on the bottom and the AI button on the side, which gives you a direct line to Google Assistant. The fingerprint sensor is on the back, once again keeping the screen clear but still putting the sensor in a useful position. There's no headphone jack, but Xiaomi includes an adapter to plug into the USB-C port if you're not a Bluetooth-audio convert.The 6.39-inch AMOLED screen on the Mi Mix 3 is made by Samsung, and it's the same size as the panel on Huawei's Mate 20 Pro. The screen covers almost all of the front of the Mi Mix 3 except for small bezels around the edge, of which you’ll notice the bottom one is slightly thicker than the rest. That's an inherited feature from previous Mi Mix phones, which placed the selfie camera at the bottom of the screen to avoid the need for a notch.Having a bezel act as a call back to previous phones in the series is a cute bit of design work. But surely, most users would prefer having as little unused space on their phone as possible over seeing some family resemblance to the phone's predecessors.Thanks to the Mi Mix 3's FHD+ resolution (2340 x 1080), everything shows up nicely without forcing you to crank up the brightness. This is a slight improvement on the Pixel 3 (2160 x 1080) and View 20 (2310 x 1080), but the result can't compete with the 1440p resolution featured in Samsung's flagship phones.The colors are well-balanced on the Mi Mix 3's display, as shown in how it displayed the Captain Marvel trailer’s Earth and space locations with equal fidelity. And if you do turn up the screen to its maximum brightness, you'll have no trouble watching the display even in bright sunlight.Our test results back this up. The Mi Mix 3's maximum brightness level was 525 nits, topping results from the View 20 (375 nits) and Pixel 3 (401). The Galaxy S9 is brighter, at 603 nits, but the Mi Mix 3 is still one of the more-vivid Android screens.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe Mi Mix 3's display depicts colors fairly accurately, as shown by its Delta E score of 0.36. That tops the View 20's mark (3.98) by a lot and just edges out the Pixel 3's score (0.44). (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) The Mi Mix 3 displays 191 percent of the sRGB color gamut, which again beats the View 20's 174 percent but doesn't quite reach the 200 percent-plus range where the Galaxy S9, Pixel 3 and OnePlus 6T sit.The Mi Mix 3's speaker, found on the phone's bottom edge, is pretty good. Listening to some movie trailers, board game reviews and mid-2000s indie rock revealed a nice, crisp sound that picks out voices, bass notes and percussion above the other elements. It's a strong sound, too, so you'll likely want to hook it up to separate speakers only if you have a large space or other loud sounds to overcome. In combination with that large, uninterrupted display, it makes for an enjoyable portable viewing experience with or without headphones.Audio isn't really this phone's focus, though. There are no special options to mess around with. And while the phone's MIUI 10 interface comes with the Mi Music and Mi Video apps to play the content you have saved on your phone, these apps don't offer any surprising settings either.Xiaomi crows about the quality of its rear-facing cameras, because its photo capabilities are some of the best ever scored by DxO. The duet of 12-megapixel shooters is a potent setup already, but post-processing magic and AI assistance, which gives the Mi Mix 3 the ability to detect 27 different scenarios and choose the best settings for each, really help the cameras shine.In these pictures of the foot of Nelson's Column and The National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, the AI puts a check on the brightness of the major light sources and brings out the contrast. This way, you can appreciate the details in the stone and metal of the bottom of the column and in the faces of the buildings.Traveling north to Oxford Street, I compared the Mi Mix 3's night mode with the Google Pixel 3's Night Sight feature. This test threatened to be a no contest in favor of the Pixel, as the low-light mode on Google's phone has been widely acclaimed for getting great images from difficult-to-capture situations. However, the Mi Mix equaled the Pixel in quality and, to my eye, produced a better photo. You can read the shop signs next to the light sources on its picture, while the Pixel has far less control of the light, which costs its photos a significant amount of detail (Note: the bluish tinge to the Mi Mix image is not the phone's fault. An ambulance happened to drive past as I was taking the photo.)In this shot taken in the daylight (or as close as one can get to it on a rainy British morning) at Hyde Park, you again see the Mi Mix doing a great job. This phone can't compare to the raw detail of the View20's 48-MP sensor, but in a side-by-side comparison at the same resolution, the Xiaomi does a better job of making the same scene look attractive.The Mi Mix 3's selfie camera, once deployed via the slider, features a 24-MP main lens, aided by a 2-MP depth-of-field sensor. I was very impressed with how I looked as I lined up a shot and then realized that the camera had the AI beautification mode already enabled, surreptitiously trimming down the shape of my lower jaw.With that feature disabled, I found that the images I took did not stack up well compared to those from the other phones. The gray but bright sky behind me made the trees in the background muddy, while I looked washed-out. You can see in the comparison how the Pixel was able to capture both me and the scenery in much better detail and color.It just goes to show how important the processing is for getting the best out of a phone's cameras. Xiaomi's pride in its low-light photography is well-founded, but this phone doesn't quite match its rivals when you change from the rear cameras to the front ones.The Snapdragon 845 processor and 6GB of RAM mean the Mi Mix 3 doesn't lack for performance oomph. Opening up and using memory-heavy apps is a snappy and uninterrupted experience. If you're after the maximum possible output, though, Xiaomi's phone isn't a class leader.The Mi Mix 3 scored 8,964 on Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance. That mark trailed results from the View 20 (9,545) and OnePlus 6T (9,098), which both use the Snapdragon 845 (though the OnePlus 6T model tested included 8GB of RAM). However, the Mi Mix 3 still beat out the Galaxy S9+ (8,295), an older phone running on the Snapdragon 845.Running 3DMark's Slingshot Extreme test to measure graphics, we recorded a score of 4,836 for the Mi Mix 3. That's an impressive result that beats those from the Galaxy S9 and S9+, Galaxy Note 9, and iPhone XS Max. This mark is even better than the Asus ROG Phone's 4,757 score, and that phone is specifically built for mobile gaming.Real-life testing with Hitman: Sniper confirmed these scores. Other than a slightly warmer back plate, you'd barely notice that the Mi Mix 3 was processing and displaying an entire snow-covered mansion with multiple characters moving around it. And combined with that big, notchless and punch-holeless display, you get an stunning uninterrupted view of the action.If you're a mobile-gaming fan, you may want to reconsider your next handset, as the Mi Mix 3 delivers comparable performance to other brands' most souped-up models, but at a lower cost.The Mi Mix 3 features a 3,200-mAh battery, which is actually 200 mAh less than the Mi Mix 2S that came before this phone. Don't worry, though, because Xiaomi's new phone uses its smaller-than-average capacity wisely.In the Tom's Guide battery test (continuous web surfing over LTE until the fully charged phone runs out of power), the Mi Mix 3 lasted 12 hours, 12 minutes, which is well above the 9-hour, 48-minute average. It also beats the View 20's 11:34 time, even though Honor's phone has a 4,000-mAh battery.MORE: Smartphones With the Longest Battery Life - A ComparisonWhen the battery on the Mi Mix 3 eventually drains, you can try out the 10-watt wireless charging pad that comes with the Mi Mix 3. It is a little slow to fill the battery, but that's a common issue with charging pads.The Mi Mix 3's MIUI 10 interface is an Android 9.0 Pie skin, as you'd hope to see in a freshly made Android flagship. I do enjoy how clean this version is. All the basic icons are simple but stylish and easy to read. There's no app drawer, something that won't surprise Xiaomi fans, as this hasn't appeared on any version of MIUI so far.That wasn't a problem during testing, since I didn't have that many apps installed, but I could see that if I had the number of apps I keep on my personal Samsung Galaxy S7 phone on the Mi Mix 3, then things could easily become chaotic. It's a choice that will make some think twice about this phone, particularly if they are unwilling to download and configure a different Android launcher to get an app drawer.The Mi Mix's OS has its pluses, though. You have the choice of either virtual menu/home/back buttons or gestures to navigate the menus, which can only be a good thing. I personally became quite attached to the Quick Ball, a quickly accessible menu for five options or apps. This acts like a stripped-down Control Center from iOS or a settings-based version of the Chat Heads function from the Android Facebook Messenger app. When not in use, the Quick Ball becomes a small, translucent arc nestling against whichever edge of the phone you position the menu, so it doesn't detract from that big screen. But you can find it quickly if you're looking for it.Additionally, you can change the function of the Mi Mix 3's slider. By default, activating the slider launches the camera app, as it reveals the selfie camera. But you can tweak that function in the settings to display a handy tools menu instead, one that features a calculator, a timer, weather info, a voice recorder and similar accessories.You can also set the slider to open another app altogether, or nothing at all if you just want to play with the mechanism without consequence. You can change the sound that the phone plays when you open the slider, including to that of a sword being drawn and sheathed. It's shameful how enjoyable I found that to be once I discovered the option.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesSecond Space is a twist on the existing Users feature available on current Android phones. With the tap of an icon, you can switch between two ""desktops,"" with a separate password for each space. There are lots of possible uses for this, like keeping the work and play sides of your life separate. Or, you could fill one desktop with games and no communications apps to keep your children occupied without fearing they're going to call anyone from the office. You could have always technically accomplished this on any Android phone since Android 5.0 Lollipop came out in 2014, but other phones require fiddling in the options menu rather than accessing the feature right from the home screen as you can on the Mi Mix.The Mi Mix 3 seems like a very deliberate attempt by Xiaomi to make a smartphone with a unique design that stands out from its rivals. That's an understandable impulse, but modern smartphone design and usage has become very standardized, especially in hardware, and users can get attached to certain features. Some people may balk at a phone with a slider and prefer similarly priced handsets like the Honor View 20 or OnePlus 6T, which have less idiosyncratic designs.If you don't mind the slider — or even prefer it, since it means an uninterrupted screen — the Mi Mix 3 is great. All your basic hardware and software needs are met and, in the case of graphics and photography, very much exceeded. The Mi Mix 3 will be perfect only for someone with a very specific set of requirements for their phone, or for users who are not fazed by the bold and sometimes ingenious ideas that come from Xiaomi. But if you're willing to be a little flexible, there's no reason why that someone couldn't be you.Credit: Tom's Guide"
156,DxO One Camera,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/dxo-one-camera,review-3512.html","Smartphone cameras are getting better and better, but they're still nowhere near as good as a bona fide mirrorless camera or DSLR. However, a dedicated camera is too bulky for shutterbugs looking to travel light. The DxO One is a great compromise between the two; its 1-inch sensor is much larger than that of any smartphone, yet this iPhone add-on is still small enough to slip into your pocket. Yes, it's pricey, but after taking the DxO on a few trips, I'm highly impressed by its quality and convenience.Update (2/2019): DxO makes a version of the DxO One with a USB Type-C connector that will work with Android phones.The DxO One is unlike any other camera before it. About the size of a wall charger for your phone, the 3.8-ounce DxO One slipped easily into my pocket, making it great for when I wanted to travel light.The front of the camera has a lens cover that, when slid open, causes a Lightning jack to pop out the side of the camera. The connector rotates 45 degrees in each direction, so you can hold the DxO and iPhone above or below your head, and still see what's on screen. I just wish it felt more secure; I was always wary of snapping off the connector.The top of the DxO has a fairly large shutter button, while the back has a small touch-screen OLED screen that provides info such as battery life, camera settings and shots remaining. Cleverly, the touch screen is only active when the DxO is disconnected from your iPhone. Below the screen is a small door that conceals the microSD card slot and a micro-USB port.There's no getting around that this is a wonderfully portable camera. However, when it was connected to my iPhone, I had to be careful not to block the DxO's lens with my middle finger.As soon as you plug the DxO into your iPhone, the DxO's app launches. The app is laid out pretty much the same way as other camera apps: The main part of the screen shows you what the camera is seeing, and along the right are settings for image quality, flash, timer and scene mode. On the left is a thumbnail image of the last photo you took, as well as a button to switch from still to video.In addition to Sports, Portrait, Landscape, and Night modes, the DxO offers shooting modes normally found only on DSLR and mirrorless cameras: P (Program), A (Aperture Priority), S (Shutter Priority) and M (Manual). Depending on the mode you select, controls to adjust the aperture, ISO and shutter speed will appear on the left. It was fairly easy to adjust the manual controls using my left thumb, but it's a much slower process than having physical dials. Still, for a camera as small as this, it's not a horrible trade-off.The DxO One's 1-inch BSI CMOS sensor produced superb images that were significantly sharper than those from the iPhone 6s.One thing I wish the DxO had was a more extensive Live View; the app only shows you the changes you make to the aperture (making the background blurrier) as well as exposure compensation.MORE: Best Photo-Editing Software From Beginner to ProYou can configure the camera to save photos just to the microSD card in the camera itself (up to 128GB), or to your iPhone. I chose the former, because it freed up storage on my phone, but to transfer photos, I had to connect the camera.After I slid the lens cover open, the DxO was ready to shoot within a second or so. I liked that, as soon as I plugged the camera into my iPhone, the DxO app automatically opened.The DxO One's 1-inch BSI CMOS sensor produced superb images that were significantly sharper than those from the iPhone 6s. In this photo of the Austrian Alps I took on a recent vacation (tough life, I know), the distant snow-capped mountains were much crisper and defined than a similar shot taken with the iPhone. Even the contrails left by passing airplanes were sharper.I also put the DxO up against the iPhone 6s' camera, as well as the Sony Alpha a5100, a $500 mirrorless camera with a 24.3-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor. In a shot of the Empire State Building taken from Madison Square Park, the DxO was just as good, if not better, than the Sony at picking up details of the skyscraper. I could better make out the art deco trim, as well as all of the radio antennas on top of the building.The DxO also captured a good amount of detail, even in the shadows. You can make out the expression on the skier hanging out underneath the Ice-Q restaurant (seen in Spectre).I was even more impressed with the DxO's metering when taking a photo from the top of the Spanish Steps in Rome; I could see a remarkable number of colors in the tourists in the shade, even though the rest of the scene was brightly lit.The one area where the DxO struggled was when shooting toward the sun. The lack of a lens hood resulted in a lot more lens flares than I expected.The DxO also excels at taking pictures of very close objects, though I found that you need to be careful if you have a very narrow depth of field. In this photo of some broccoli romano, not all of the points are in focus.In low-light conditions, the DxO managed to capture well-defined images. I was pleased with the evenness of the lighting, as well as the details in a picture of a woman with the New York skyline in the background.The DxO was generally quick to focus, usually taking about a second to do so. But occasionally, it was confused, especially in darker situations. You can also tap on any part of your iPhone's screen to have the DxO focus on that point. While not a speed demon, the DxO was ready to shoot about half a second after taking a photo. You'll get a faster response from a camera such as the Sony A5100, but then again, the DxO isn't meant for sports photography.MORE: Best Lens Kits for iPhone PhotographersAlthough it shoots video at a max of only 1080p and 30 frames per second, the DxO performed well here, too. A video I shot of a rainy Bryant Park was detailed and in focus. Colors were well saturated, with the exception of yellow daffodils, which looked blown out.However, while filming, the video feed from the DxO to my iPhone was jittery, especially as I panned around. Most likely, I was stretching the processing power of the DxO to its limit.A neat trick with the DxO is that you can use it even when it's disconnected from your iPhone, making it fantastic for impromptu and surreptitious shots. In this mode, the DxO's display turns into a touch screen, and lets you swipe between camera and video modes. Even more clever is a live preview mode; while the DxO's miniscule screen shows only a very pixelated black-and-white image, it helps give you some sense of what you're aiming the camera at.DxO estimates that the One's battery will last through about 200 photos — a claim I found to be fairly accurate. To conserve battery life, the DxO goes into power-saving mode after 50 seconds of inactivity. After 2 minutes of inactivity, the camera turns off.No matter how good it is, every third-party iPhone lens faces the same reality: It just doesn't take images as good as the ones from a real camera. The DxO One is the perfect compromise for people who want to get better pictures but don't want to be weighed down by a lot of gear. The DxO One not only lets you shoot excellent images but also gives you full manual control. At less than $200, it's one of the more expensive iPhone accessories, but one of the best, too.MORE: Best Pocket-Sized Cameras"
157,CAT S48c,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/cat-s48c,review-6116.html","Most of us probably aren't employed in a line of work where we subject our smartphones to treacherous conditions. But for those braving the elements every day, from construction workers to first responders, durability takes priority over bells and whistles.Bullitt Group makes CAT-branded smartphones especially for this discerning group of people, with the $599 CAT S48c arriving as its latest effort. Clad in a heavily ruggedized body with ample helpings of rubber, physical navigation keys and watertight doors for ports, the S48c won't outrun similarly priced premium handsets, but it will outlast them.The CAT S48c retails for $599 and can be purchased through two major wireless carriers, with some caveats.Sprint customers are able to buy the phone as they would any other, though this variant is equipped with only 32GB of storage space. Once you factor in the size of Android, updates and preinstalled software, you're left with just 20GB of storage for everything else. There is a microSD slot for expandability, though the largest card the phone will accept is 128GB.Verizon also offers the S48c, and with 64GB of storage as standard, no less. However, only Big Red's business and enterprise clients can get it. We reviewed the Sprint model.Tipping the scales at 9.4 ounces, the CAT S48c isn't pretty, easily pocketable or feasible for those with smaller hands, like yours truly. But then, that's not really the point.The S48c isn't designed to be easy to live with; it's designed to be damn near impossible to kill. That explains the half-inch-thick edges wrapped in resilient soft-touch plastic and the octagonal footprint — all of which were excellent at dissipating impact when we dropped the phone on solid concrete. The S48c brushed off repeated tumbles from 7.5 feet high, showing only light scuffs on the rubber-reinforced corners.None of this is to say Bullitt hasn't made some nods toward comfort. The back side features ridges that should make the S48c easier to hold onto for those donning heavy-duty gloves. And the trio of physical navigation keys and the extra-large programmable side button guarantee the sort of instant, responsive tactile feedback you want in the most strenuous of use cases.We appreciate Bullitt's commitment to the headphone jack, which is shrouded by the same robust, flappy doors that obscure the SIM card and microSD slots, as well as the USB Type-C port. These help earn the S48c its IP68 water-resistance rating, allowing the handset to survive submersion in up to 4 feet of water for a maximum of 30 minutes.Unfortunately, all that durability has come at the expense of the fingerprint sensor. Just as you must do with 2017's CAT S41, you'll have to manually input PIN codes and passwords to safely unlock the S48c, which is a real nuisance. Some form of rudimentary face unlock would have been extremely useful here, for those who can't afford to waste as much time fussing with their devices on the job.The 5-inch, 1080p display on CAT's latest handset feels a bit antiquated, due to its 16:9 aspect ratio. But underneath, it's solid for an LCD panel, with accurate colors and strong brightness.That brightness is an absolute must for easy outdoor usage. The S48c's peak full-screen luminance of 516 nits handily surpasses the 413-nit Moto G6, but falls well short of the old CAT S41, which hit 591 nits.That said, this isn't the kind of display that's going to blow you away with its colors or sharpness. Watching a trailer for the upcoming Spider-Man flick, I was disappointed by the panel's dreary explosions and muted visual effects. It wasn't a terrible experience by any means; the S48c's representation of 126 percent of the sRGB color space is perfectly in line with rival LCD-powered handsets. But it just doesn't dazzle.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesUsers will appreciate that Bullitt has included an optional Glove Mode, which slightly increases sensitivity to touches. However, even with the feature switched on, the display isn't responsive to every material — heavy winter mitts won't do here.Like a lot of other Android phones in its price range, the S48c can take serviceable shots when lighting is ideal, but promptly struggles in dimly lit places.On the back of the phone, you'll find just one 13-megapixel lens. There's no secondary shooter for bokeh or wide-angle shots, which, honestly, isn't a massive loss on a device designed for durability first. But the S48c's camera has a tendency to produce blurry and oversaturated images, even in the best of shooting conditions.I was pleasantly surprised by the S48c's attempt to capture some decor in front of one of our office windows. But when I opted to grab a portrait of my colleague Shaun under the same lighting, the S48c's flaws quickly became evident. You have to hold the phone perfectly still to get a clean result, and even then, the darker portions, like Shaun's beard and shirt, lack a certain fidelity.Our darkened video studio definitely put the S48c's camera on trial. The $799 iPhone XR we used for comparison purposes employs clever software to dynamically brighten areas of the frame that ordinarily wouldn't be fully exposed. The S48c doesn't benefit from any such post-processing, and the product is a muddy photo that much more obviously looks like it came from a phone.Don't expect anything better from the front lens, either. The S48c's anemic 5-MP shooter couldn't be further off the mark; it delivered a totally washed-out selfie that almost resembled something you'd expect to see from a surveillance camera.As long as you're not expecting flagship-caliber performance, the S48c and its Snapdragon 630 system-on-chip shouldn't leave you wanting for more power. Just don't expect to do any hardcore gaming.I found little slowdown when thumbing around Android, exploring my surroundings with Google Maps or cycling through recently used apps. The S48c's 4GB of RAM — on par with Google's Pixel 3 — certainly helped in that regard.Unfortunately, the meager Adreno 508 GPU quickly showed its limits when it ran more demanding apps. An older game like Crazy Taxi Classic proved to be a breeze for the device, allowing me to dart around town ferrying passengers with nary a dropped frame. But PUBG Mobile was a very different experience: It was peppered with its fair share of hiccups, even on the lowest possible settings.MORE: 5 Ways to Improve Your Android Phone's Battery LifeThe S48c's multicore Geekbench 4 score of 4,118 falls within the range of acceptability for a midrange product, though it's a bit underwhelming for a $599 handset. The $249 Moto G6, which registered a 3,934 result from its Snapdragon 450 silicon, is almost as powerful. And the $499 BlackBerry Key2 handily outclassed CAT's latest with its 5,832 score.The S48c's 4,000-mAh battery lasted 13 hours and 8 minutes in our testing, where we streamed web pages over Sprint's LTE network indefinitely until it ran out of juice.That's an excellent result, though CAT's previous midrange effort, the S41, outlasts it with a 5,000-mAh power pack that ran for nearly 15 and a half hours when we put it through its paces. The S41 also incorporated reverse charging, which is something you sadly won't find on the S48c — a surprising omission in this multitool of a smartphone.Bullitt hasn't messed with Android 8.1 Oreo much at all on the S48c, though if you opt for the Sprint model, you can expect a handful of preinstalled apps.Some of this software, like Sprint Direct Connect Plus, which enables push-to-talk functionality over LTE, should be a boon to CAT's customers. But most of it firmly falls in the bloatware category, from Lookout Security to 1Weather (the ad-supported version, mind you) and the Amazon Shopping app.The S48c's Programmable Key lives on the left side of the handset underneath the power button, and you can instruct it to carry out specific actions or launch apps, based on whether you perform a short or long press. It's also the button that initiates push-to-talk mode if you're inclined to use it.If you can't afford to worry about your smartphone quitting before you do, the CAT S48c is well worth a look. This combination of durability and battery life is almost nonexistent among consumer handsets. If one thing is certain, Bullitt spared no expense building the latest CAT phone into the tank it ought to be.The S48c becomes far less compelling, however, in light of all the sacrifices it makes to deliver that kind of grit for $599. The device's middling performance and dreary display are one thing, but it's the phone's camera that's especially heartbreaking. You'll want to carry the S48c along on all your journeys because of its ruggedness, but the dismal photography will discourage you from uploading your discoveries to Instagram.And so the S48c ends up beating a drum familiar to almost all supertough smartphones, save for Samsung's on-again, off-again Galaxy S Active series. For an extremely specific and demanding subset of buyers, it may check all the right boxes. But unless you regularly use a smartphone under demanding conditions, you're better off buying an iPhone and stuffing it in one of Otterbox's protective cases.Credit: Tom's Guide"
158,Honor View 20,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/honor-view-20-review,news-29181.html","Honor is a brand in a state of flux. Once known as the cool kid on the block — a smart, funky alternative to the boring mid-range phone pack — it’s now looking at the premium-flagship handset market with envious, yet hungry eyes.  The problem is that if you are really going to take on the likes of the iPhone XS, Google Pixel 3 and Samsung Galaxy Note 9, then you need to come oozing innovation and packing impressive specs.On paper, that's exactly what Honor has done with the Honor View 20. You can’t get much more impressive than the View 20’s headline-grabbing feature, its 48-megapixel rear camera, which is just one of two lenses on the phone’s back. It's a record sensor size for a phone camera, a revelation and a feature that demands to be interrogated. That is exactly what I’ve been doing since I got my hands on this handset at CES 2019.Honor View 20 Cheat SheetPricing and AvailabilityThere are two models available -- the first with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, and the second with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. These are quite considerable specs, but Honor is usually very competitively priced. And the View 20 is of no exception with official pricing for the 128GB version coming in at £499 / 579 Euros.For American readers, those above prices convert directly to $648. Unfortunately, it's unclear at this time whether the View 20 is going to be offered by any carriers or retailers in the U.S. Honor is part of Huawei, after all, which isn't enjoying a great relationship with the U.S. government at the moment.Even before that relationship got frosty, previous Honor devices struggled to make it to American shelves. Again, check back here soon to see if we have any updates about who's selling the View 20 and for how much.SpecsDesign: Beating rivals to the punch (hole)The Honor View 20 is the phone first to come to market with what will eventually be a common design: a screen (6.4-inch, 2310x1080 resolution, IPS LCD display) with a punch-hole camera. It’s beautiful to look at, given that we have all had to put up with notches over the past year and a half.The circle in the left corner, which houses a 25-MP, 27mm selfie camera (f/2.0), is barely noticeable at first glance. When the front camera does occasionally catch your eye, especially when you're Googling or using any app with a lot of white space, it’s a little like a black hole sucking all the light and vying for attention. On the (w)hole, however, it’s non-intrusive and lacks the annoyance a notch brings.The View 20’s brilliant screen is bordered by a slight bezel. It’s noticeable but accentuates the all-screen display. If you flip the phone over, you can’t help but be mesmerized by the holographic V-shaped design on the glass rear. It’s a wonderful design flourish that is really is a joy to look at when it catches the light.The only ugly thing about the back is the phrase Honor uses to describe this type of color scheme: nanolithographic. Ugh.Size wise, the View 20 fits well in the hand. Measuring 6.18 x 2.97 x 0.32 inches (156.9 x 75.4 x 8.1mm) it is somewhat sleeker than other 6.4-inch smartphones, which very much veer into phablet territory. For instance, Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 has the same screen size but is a chunkier 161.9 x 76.4 x 8.8mm. The 6.5-inch iPhone XS Max, at 157.5 x 77.4 x 7.7mm, is beaten by the View 20 in all but thickness.The View 20 weighs 180g (6.35 oz). Compare this to the Note 9 (201g) and iPhone XS (174g), and you have a phone somewhere in the middle of them both. In my tests, its weight makes the View 20 a solid phone to use, one that doesn’t feel flimsy yet won’t give you arm ache when you hold it up for the inevitable selfies you will be taking.Other features include the volume rocker and power button on the right-hand side (same as with last year’s View 10), while the left side houses the MicroSIM tray. You’ll find a USB-C port and mic on the bottom of the device, and — shock, horror, gasp — a 3.5mm jack on the top. Nice to see some companies have faith in ye olde headphone input.There’s no MicroSD slot available on the View 20, but you do get up to 256GB of internal storage. Honor hasn’t gone the way of parent company Huawei and put the speaker in the charging socket, so there’s a speaker grille on the bottom.Besides the cameras and an unnecessary AI Vision label, the back of the View 20 houses a fingerprint sensor. That’s right, there isn’t in-screen security on board here as you’ll find on phones like the OnePlus 6T. You do get face recognition on the View 20, which works well thanks to the ToF (Time of Flight) sensor on board.Display: A bold, not as bright new lookFor good reason, Honor is calling this an All-View Display (thanks to the punch-hole design) and it’s a refreshing and (currently) unique screen. The 6.4-inch LCD screen on the Honor View 20 is gorgeous, though it's not quite 4K. It’s a Full HD+ (2,310 x 1,080 pixels) screen with a 19:25.9 aspect ratio.If the punch-hole camera is here to stay, then I would be happy, as this notch-free alternative is subtle and ultimately very effective. The camera hole has been made as small as possible by some clever engineering by Honor. It’s to do with Honor merging layers of the LCD with the camera lens which makes for a smaller aperture.It’s the ultimate in camera integration and a really smart move by Honor. This level of design detail is harder to do on an LCD screen compared to OLED. Contrast that with the recent iPhone XR, which struggles to hide the notch compared to the iPhone XS because of the LCD and its backlight.The View 20’s aspect ratio is broader than what’s seen on most phones, because of a fantastic statistic: It has a 91.8 percent screen-to-body ratio. That is impressive — the iPhone XS manages ""just"" 84.4 percent.Now, LCD vs. OLED is a debate that can go on forever, but I was really impressed with this screen for the most part. The View 20’s panel suffered when taken outside in bright light, but for the majority of my time using the View 20, the screen was bright, big and bawdy and viewing angles were strong.Putting it through our lab tests, the View 20's screen managed 375 nits of brightness. While this is better than the Google Pixel 3XL (362 nits), it is way off the iPhone XS' 606 nits and the Galaxy Note 9's 604 nits in our testing.  The sRGB color gamut registered 174 percent. In context, that’s in between the iPhone XS Max (123 percent) and Galaxy Note 9 (224 percent). Finally, the Honor View 20’s panel clocked a Delta-E score of 3.98. Given 0 is perfect we were expecting more in its hue accuracy.  MORE: Why I’m Still Using the iPhone SECamera: Among the bestThis is where the Honor View 20 gets really interesting. The phone houses an exceptional camera, one that makes as much use as it can out of the 48MP on offer. It manages 48MP by taking advantage of the new Sony IMX586 sensor.The shots we took at 48MP were sharp and detailed. Even on a gray day in London, next to Browning’s Pool, the texture of the water pulls through well and there’s sumptuous detail in the bark of the trees and the dirt on the supposed white paving area.If you want an increase in detail, then Honor has added an optional AI layer on top of the 48MP option. Called AI Ultra Clarity, it doesn’t add in any more pixels but enhances the detail of the shot, so much so that things like the text on signs in the image becomes clearer.It does suffer a little from over processing, but this is a nice touch from Honor. Given that you haven’t got the ability to zoom in while shooting in 48MP, this would be a nice alternative if you were to put the image into Photoshop and crop.We took some snaps outside of Kings Cross station in London and the difference between the mode being on and off was incremental.Compared to the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and OnePlus 6T, the View 20's camera does incredibly well. In Portrait mode, the Honor phone is exceptional, beating its rivals in our tests. It added just the right amount of bokeh for my liking, although it still gets caught out with strands of hair and the like.The View 20 outclassed the OnePlus 6T in all our tests, but the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 seemed to edge it when it came to the pastry shots we took.There really isn’t much between the View 20 and the Pixel 3, one of the best camera phones currently available. The Honor does over sharpen in its processing, though. Our comparison shots show rich detail from both phones, but the extra megapixel grunt does seem to give the View 20 a slight edge when it comes to detail. The Google Pixel 3 still feels like the better all-round camera phone, however.Honor is, quite rightly, proud of the View 20’s camera credentials. It’s a phone that has managed to push what camera phones can do when it comes to megapixel count. It doesn’t quite have the standout featured that I had hoped for, though.Yes, 48MP is a phenomenal achievement on a phone but there’s nothing like the Google Pixel 3’s Night Sight mode that you could push as a unique selling position. The Night Mode on the View 20 does a pretty decent job at picking out detail through the murk, even if the images we took were a little blurry.The 25-MP selfie camera also works well, but the bokeh effect did get confused a few times with hair and the like. Again, the megapixel count is impressive, but it doesn’t really add that much to the quality of the images when compared to other phones.There are a nice amount of manual controls available on the View 20. The camera app setup is practically the same as used in the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, so you can control things like exposure compensation, white balance and ISO.For those who prefer the phone to take control, the AI features may not be pushed as hard as on the Mate 20 Pro but there are some 1,500 scenarios the phone should recognize. I mostly got ""leaves"" and ""building"" in my tests, so we will have to take Honor’s word for that.The other side of the AI can be seen in the AR Camera functionality (Honor’s passable attempt at Google’s AR Lens) and a version of Apple’s Animoji, which is a little on the gimmicky side.Performance: Impressive resultsThe Honor View 20 really impressed in our performance tests. Featuring the Kirin 980 chip (the same as the Huawei Mate 20 Pro) and an octo-core processor, Honor’s phone scored a massive 9,545 on Geekbench 4, a test which checks overall performance. It’s not surprising that this score is achingly similar to the Mate 20 Pro, which scored a slightly higher 9,973.That score is still behind what  the Apple iPhone XS Max (11,515) can do with its A12 Bionic processor. But it’s above phones like the OnePlus 6T (8,972), Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (8,876) and the Google Pixel 3 XL (7,684), which are all powered by a Snapdragon 845 chipset.On 3DMark Slingshot Extreme, which measures graphics performance, the View 20 managed 3682. In comparison the Pixel 3 XL reached 4,396, the iPhone XS Max (4,339) and the Note 9 (4,639). This isn’t a bad score, but it’s clear that Honor’s focus has been elsewhere.The View 20’s benchmark results were backed up by real-world testing. Fortnite on the handset was buttery smooth, and so was Hitman Sniper. Flipping between apps, such as Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, showed little-to-no lag. Even Chrome and YouTube, notorious data sappers, were slick on the device.When playing games, the amount of screen dedicated to gaming is superb. That small punch-hole is covered up by your thumb when gaming, which makes it feel like the game takes over the entire screen. This is something phones with notches or big bezels just can’t match.Battery: Long-lasting phoneThe Honor View 20 has been given a 4,000-mAh battery, and this shows in our tests. On the Tom’s Guide Battery Test, where we continuously surf the web over T-Mobile’s LTE network at 150 nits of screen brightness, the View 20 lasted a brilliant 11 hours, 34 minutes, beating the smartphone average of 9:48.That topped the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which clocked in at 10:09. This also beats the Note 9, which lasted an impressive 11:16 hours. But it didn’t quite match the Google Pixel 2 XL, which is still high up at 12:09.In real-world use, this meant that we had a phone that lasted a full day (with regular social-network checking, gaming and Netflix on our commute) and then some.According to Honor's numbers, the Super Charge system can get the View 20's battery to 55 percent full after 30 minutes charging. Our testing proved that to be quite accurate; our demo handset going from zero to 50 percent in 26 minutes, 75 percent in 40 minutes and to full charge at the 1-hour-15-minute mark. While there’s fast charging on board, there’s no wireless charging, which is a real shame.Software and InterfaceI’ve never been the biggest fan of EMUI, Honor’s bespoke user interface. It was with a little bit of relief, and some trepidation, that I tried out the View 20’s UI as it’s a phone that makes use of Magic UI 2.0.This is an Android launcher and is never going to satisfy those who like their Android a little purer, but it does feel improved. As with EMUI, it comes out of the box as having all the apps on one screen. You can choose to have an app drawer and also choose from the type of system navigation: gesture, three-key navigation (the default) and navigation dock.If you want to make the best use of the screen then gesture is your best bet here. It’s nice and intuitive using the gestures, but not having the visuals may put some people off.It’s difficult to point to any significant changes between EMUI and Magic UI as it all feels like a rebranding exercise at the moment. But the menu-tidying that Huawei did for the Mate 20 Pro seems to be present in this UI and there’s a slickness flicking between apps.There are a few changes to options that I noted as well. On the camera app, AR Lens is a lot more apparent. Instead of being in the More section, as it was put in the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, it’s now on the main menu, right next to Night mode.The main settings menus is identical to EMUI 9.0, even down to having Huawei Share as an option. Given Honor wants to break out as a brand on its own, I would have expected an Honor-branded version of this service to be found in the View 20. The same goes with the Huawei ID log in section on the View 20.There’s a notable omission, too, of a Dark Mode. Not only is this one of the most popular modes around at the moment when it comes to helping combat eye strain, but it also helps with battery power. I couldn’t find this in the myriad menus of the View 20. There is an Eye Comfort option, though, that is said to help “visual fatigue” by filtering out blue light.  Another wellbeing option is Digital Balance, with which you can add screen-time-management options to your phone use and see how long you have been using your phone.Those who are fans of Honor’s Party mode will be pleased to read that it is present and correct on the View 20. This allows you sync the songs on your phone with another Honor phone. This was offered in an update to the View 10 and comes as standard with the View 20.MORE: Most Anticipated Phones of 2019Bottom LineThe Honor View 20 is a smartphone with standout specs that aims for the heights of the other flagship phones on the market and nearly reaches them. Its camera technology is stunning, its punch-hole display mesmerizing. The designers of the View 20 have to be applauded for managing to get the selfie camera in such a tight space that allows the rest of the screen to stand out.Couple this with beefy battery life and a rear design that’s unlike anything else on the market and Honor really has created a phone that packs a punch. If it does come at a price under $500/£500 (TBC) then there is a lot of phone here for the money.Unfortunately, Magic UI 2.0 still doesn’t match the software on other phones and will certainly irk Android purists. Thankfully Android 9 is underneath but you still have to wade through some unnecessary re-skinning to get to what you want.And then there’s the 48MP camera. On paper this is a jaw-dropping spec and while in our tests it shined, there was nothing that stood out among it peers. You’ll get a top-performing camera from the View 20, but if taking photos are your primary concern, there are phones out there that marry specs with software that bit better.But that’s the thing about the Honor View 20. Its peers are no longer midrange phones, but now include the likes of the Note 9 and iPhone XS Max. And thanks to the improvements made by Honor, the View 20 fits in very well with that company.Credit: Tom's Guide"
159,BlackBerry Key2 LE,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blackberry-key2-le,review-5956.html","When TCL released the BlackBerry Key2 earlier this year, we were impressed by Chinese phone maker TCL's second stab at building a BlackBerry with a physical keyboard. But we weren't as enamored with the handset's price: $649, which was $100 more than its predecessor's for reasons we found hard to justify.Perhaps TCL saw the error of of its ways, or maybe just an opportunity. Because shortly after the Key2's debut, the company announced a less expensive and less powerful variant named the Key2 LE. This BlackBerry downgrades its processor, RAM, cameras and battery size and trades its aluminum construction for polycarbonate. In doing so, it manages to hit a much more reasonable price of $449 — $200 less than the Key2.But with all those compromises working against it, can the Key2 LE remain a worthy contender for enterprise users? Here's what the new phone brings to the table, and where it succeeds and fails against its pricier rival in the BlackBerry family.TCL announced at CES 2019 that the BlackBerry Key2 LE will soon be available through Verizon for that carrier's business customers. We've updated the availability section of this review to reflect that.The Key2 LE normally costs $449 (£349) but is available for $429 from Amazon and Best Buy as of this writing. Like the regular Key2, this new version is designed to work with GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile. It's even certified to work on Verizon, and soon that carrier will start selling the phone to its business customers. (Unfortunately, you're out of luck if you prefer using Sprint's network.)The Key 2 LE comes in three different colors — Slate, Champagne (gold) and Turbo (red) — although, at the time of writing, Slate is the only option available at U.S. retailers. The phone packs 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage; in other regions, like the U.K., TCL sells a cheaper 32GB model. There's a microSD slot on the side of the phone that allows you to expand capacity up to 256GB.Place the Key2 LE side-by-side with the Key2, and you're not likely to notice what TCL changed between the two handsets — once you get past the design, that is.The Key2 LE incorporates a plastic frame, making it about half an ounce lighter. And unlike the standard Key2’s unibody construction, the Key2 LE features a plastic ring encircling the display and keyboard, joining the face of the device with those faux-brushed metal sides. The rubbery, soft-touch backing has also been refinished with a new dotted pattern that doesn't feel quite as grippy as the fine diamond texture of the original model.The Key2's signature feature — its physical QWERTY keyboard — has seen some alterations, too. The keycaps themselves have shrunk ever so slightly, though they're still 10 percent larger than those on 2017’s KeyOne.An arguably more divisive omission, however, relates to the keyboard's touch sensitivity. TCL has removed it from this model, meaning you can't swipe on the keyboard to scroll through web pages. However, the spacebar still functions as a fingerprint sensor, and the Speed Key has been preserved for keystroke shortcuts.Everything else that differentiates the Key2 LE is hidden from view. The lower-priced model features 4GB of RAM, as opposed to the Key2's 6GB, and incorporates Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 CPU, instead of the Snapdragon 660 chipset.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe camera employs a dual-lens setup on the back for portraits with artistic bokeh, though the Key2 LE's 13-megapixel main sensor and 5-MP depth sensor are exclusive to this model and different from the stereo 12-MP setup in the Key2. Finally, the battery capacity has been downsized from 3,500 mAh to 3,000 mAh.Several things stand out about this stripped down version of the BlackBerry Key2.Keyboard still shines: While TCL's keyboard cost-saving measures likely won't be warmly received from the BlackBerry faithful, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself typing faster on the Key2 LE than I did on the Key2.Yes, the keycaps are indeed a hair smaller on the new model, though it didn't affect my dexterity as much as I expected. The bigger change, I quickly discovered, was how TCL lessened the keys' degree of travel.It's a small change, but the result is that you encounter a bit less resistance with every press. That helped me bounce from key to key faster, and the time I saved definitely added up. I am by no means a physical keyboard maestro; my first attempted at The Typing Cat's test with the Key2 yielded a lousy 19 words per minute. But I was able to turn out a marginally more respectable 25 wperm with the Key2 LE.DTEK software and App Cloning: BlackBerry's DTEK suite, which serves as the nexus of all the Key2 LE's security-minded features, remains mostly unchanged from previous devices. That means you get detailed reports of what apps are abusing permissions (and when and where they're doing it, no less). Other tools, such as the Privacy Locker encrypted folder and Redactor for markup, are designed to safeguard your enterprise secrets.There is one new addition to DTEK's repertoire, however, and it comes in the form of app cloning. Now, software that is typically tied to a single device (like, say, WhatsApp or Snapchat) can be duplicated if you so choose, allowing you to use both your personal and professional profiles on the same phone.TCL isn't first to introduce this feature — Huawei pulled it off more than a year ago, and it's been reaching increasingly more Android phones ever since. But the Key2 LE’s implementation is the best we’ve encountered because it takes advantage of the phone’s dual-SIM nature. Cloned apps and multiple accounts can be tied to individual SIM cards and therefore phone numbers — a huge boon for social media managers.Decent performance: The Key2 wasn’t a powerhouse by any stretch, and neither is the Key2 LE. The cheaper model's Snapdragon 636 chipset sits somewhere between the Snapdragon 625 inside last year’s KeyOne and Moto G5 Plus, and the Snapdragon 660 inside the regular Key2. In fact, this LE variant is driven by the same chip behind the much cheaper Nokia 7.1.However, while the Key2's $649 price definitely seemed a bit high for its limited power — especially compared with handsets like the OnePlus 6T that offer flagship-beating specs for $529 — the Key2 LE is a more fitting marriage of performance and affordability. The latest BlackBerry turned in a Geekbench 4 score of 4,945 — right on target with the Nokia 7.1's 4,953 result, though the Nokia costs $100 less.The Key2 LE's 4GB of memory isn't quite as generous as the Key2's 6GB, but it's still enough to keep background processes humming along and accommodate frequently switching apps, as business-minded users are wont to do.MORE: Best Budget Phones - Unlocked Phones Under $200, $300 ...Graphics performance isn't as blistering, of course — this isn't a device we recommend for demanding games, as its Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 score of just 957 suggests. Arcade racer Asphalt 9: Legends automatically dropped down to modest settings to accommodate the hardware, and even then, gameplay was still inconsistent, with frame skips and hiccups peppering the experience.Its strengths aside, the Key2 LE suffers from notable flaws we couldn't overlook.Design and build quality: The Key2 was a real step forward for modern BlackBerry, with a sleek, consistent design devoid of chintzy materials and gaudy metallic accents. In matte black, it was subtly stunning and smart-looking, and more attractive than any BlackBerry-branded handset had a right to be.The Key2 LE, unfortunately, moves in the wrong direction. In many ways it's a cross between the KeyOne and Key2, as it emulates the newer phone's general shape but carries over the first-generation's frets in the keyboard and jumbled-together assortment of surfaces, textures and materials.Plastic can be a replacement for aluminum when done well. But in this case, it leaves the Key2 LE feeling like the budget BlackBerry that it is. The fake brushed texture on the polycarbonate frame won't fool anyone, either — it's the kind of fruitless attempt at conveying an upmarket look that so many supercheap budget models from the likes of Alcatel and Samsung try to pull off.At least the Key2 LE's still got a headphone jack, and the phone's good-enough 4.5-inch 1620 x 1080 LCD display is the same as the Key2's.Unremarkable cameras: The dual 13-megapixel and 5-megapixel lenses on the back of the Key2 LE are about par for the course as far as budget phone cameras are concerned. It's not the worst photography we've seen in a budget phone, though BlackBerry's camera struggles with white balancing and has a tendency to over-sharpen.More often than not, that over-sharpening leads to an abundance of noise. Looking out at the ice rink at New York's Bryant Park, the Key2 LE presents a scene with muted colors and a greenish-yellow cast compared with what the Nokia 7.1 achieved. BlackBerry's shooters tinge poorly lit areas with unsightly graininess and multicolored artifacts, like at the base of the flower arrangement and lighting fixture.In our video studio, the Nokia 7.1 demonstrated its capabilities in low-light compared with the Key2 LE, which failed to light the frame as thoroughly or convey the crimson hues of the brick wall. However, the BlackBerry's sharpness worked to its advantage here — something particularly evident as you zoom into the tools and other fine details.To its credit, the Key2 LE also captured a clearer shot of the shops at Bryant Park's Winter Village. The text on the storefronts is noticeably easier to read on BlackBerry's phone, and the Key2 LE actually bested the Nokia 7.1 concerning the texture of the stone walkway and the side of New York Public Library, which sits adjacent to the park.The 5-MP depth sensor on the back of the Key2 LE allows bokeh for portraits, though don't expect the results to rival what you get from dual-lens flagships like the iPhone XS and Samsung Galaxy S9+. Both the BlackBerry and Nokia turn in blurry portraits of my colleague Jorge, though at least the Nokia gets his skin tone mostly right and dials down the noise to acceptable levels.There's less to say about the Key2 LE’s selfies shot by the front 8-MP camera. Images lack some fidelity as they smooth out facial features and blemishes even when retouching is switched off. The relative darkness from BlackBerry's front camera compared with what the Nokia 7.1 turned in isn’t particularly flattering, either.Loss of trackpad functionality: The Key2 embedded a trackpad in its keyboard that assumed different roles throughout the phone. You could use it to scroll through webpages and apps without obscuring the display, move the typing cursor around text fields or flip back-and-forth between home screens.While the feature had been done before — it debuted on 2014's BlackBerry Passport, a device built at a time when BlackBerry was still manufacturing its own hardware — it was an exclusive perk with clear real-world utility. More important, it proved the old-fashioned physical keyboard, ordinarily dismissed as a relic, could be innovated in ways that its touch screen-only brethren could not.Sadly, that calling card has been scrubbed in the Key2 LE, and TCL's latest BlackBerry is worse off for it. The embedded trackpad was starting to become a memorable feature for a brand that could certainly use something to be remembered for; with its loss, the Key2 LE has lost a big part of its identity, too.Smaller battery: The original Key2 lasted for 11 hours and 9 minutes when we put it through our battery test earlier this year, and we didn't expect the Key2 LE to be far behind. While TCL did shrink the battery to 3,000 mAh from 3,500 mAh on the regular Key2, this is still a handset with a midrange chipset and less-than-full-HD LCD display. Ten hours, or maybe 10-and-a-half-hours should have been doable.MORE: Smartphones With the Longest Battery Life - A ComparisonUnfortunately, the Key2 LE underwhelmed our even-tempered expectations. It turned in just 8 hours and 45 minutes of continuous LTE web surfing over T-Mobile's network. Granted, that's better than the 7:41 of the Nokia 7.1, but BlackBerry was once a brand renowned for its consideration for battery life, and the Key2 LE doesn't back up that reputation.It was a prudent move for TCL to attempt a less expensive version of the BlackBerry Key 2. Unfortunately, in the process, the company eliminated many of the things we loved about the phone.Sure, the Key2 LE is cheaper, but it's lacking those critical BlackBerry hallmarks. The sleek metal unibody design has been swapped for something flimsier and tackier, the battery has evidently been made a bit too small to keep it lasting as long as we'd hope and the decision to remove touch sensitivity has stripped the handset of its modernity.The result simply feels old and cheap — even though, in the grand scheme of things, it's not even that compelling a bargain. The Nokia 6.1, 7.1 and Moto X4 are all outfitted with stock Android One, which is already quite secure and clean, and guarantee similar performance for hundreds less.The regular Key2 may have been overpriced at $649, but at least it conveyed those BlackBerry values of quality and reliability that TCL has so desperately tried to instill in smartphone buyers again. The Key2 LE, conversely, feels like an imitation. It's a great way for cost-conscious buyers to get a handset with a physical keyboard — and, sadly, not much else.Credit: Tom's Guide"
160,LG V35 ThinQ,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-v35-thinq,review-5490.html","Editors' Note: We've updated this review to note LG's release of the V40 ThinQ, the new entry to its V-series of phones that features three rear cameras plus two more shooters on the front.If at first you don't succeed, repeatedly rerelease your phone until somebody notices. This appears to be LG's strategy with the V30, the flagship phone the company introduced in October 2017.A few months later, LG launched an iteration of the V30 called the V30S ThinQ that was almost exactly the same but with more storage and a camera powered by AI object recognition. Since that camera update also made it to the V30, the V30S ThinQ felt especially pointless.Now, there's yet another revision of the V30: the V35 ThinQ. To LG's credit, this third attempt is at least appreciably different under the hood, and the V30 was already a competent phone. But with this device's steep price of $899 and exclusivity to AT&T and Google Project Fi, LG sure is asking customers to make a lot of sacrifices for last year's design — especially with the subsequent release of the LG V40 ThinQ and its unique five-camera setup..On the surface, the V35 ThinQ looks and feels like the V30 and V30S that came before it. The biggest changes can't been seen from the exterior, though they are pretty sizable upgrades over LG's earlier models.For starters, LG has upgraded the system-on-chip to Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 845 platform. This is the same processor powering the LG G7 ThinQ, as well as countless other topline Android handsets that have debuted in 2018 (including LG's own V40).MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesHowever, LG didn't stop there. The company gave the V35 6GB of RAM, up from 4GB in all of LG's recent flagships, including the G7. That makes the V35 the most powerful of all of LG's phones, even though this device is also unavailable on most carriers and not sold unlocked.LG redesigned the cameras for the new phone, too. The V35 inherits the G7's imaging tech, meaning users get a pair of 16-megapixel sensors on the back of the handset. The main camera has an f/1.6 aperture — among the largest in modern phones — as well as optical image stabilization. The secondary lens is rated f/1.9 and employs a 107-degree, wide-angle perspective. The front camera also produces slightly sharper selfies, now 8 megapixels, up from the V30's 5 megapixels.  Even though the processor and cameras are identical, a lot is different between the two phones, actually. LG says its V-series phones are where it prefers to experiment with features aimed at early adopters and the hard-core crowd. This series is where LG began implementing quad digital-to-analog converters for better audio playback — something that just made its way into the G7.But not all of those benefits have trickled down to LG's more mainstream flagship. The V35's 6-inch pOLED screen is probably the best example of that. V35 owners also get the aforementioned extra RAM compared to what the G7 has, and of course, the two phones' designs are totally different. If you hate notches, you'll likely find the V35 to be a much more attractive phone.Interacting with this phone is fundamentally different, too. The G7 has a taller, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, which makes this handset thinner and a bit easier to use one-handed than the V35, with its 18:9 aspect ratio. The V35 also statshes its power button in the fingerprint sensor on the back, below the camera. This design is an odd holdover from LG's older devices, considering the G7 has a stand-alone power button on the right edge and a Google Assistant key on the left. Thankfully, though, you can still double knock on the V35's screen, so you won't have to lift the phone every time you need to wake it.It may not feel quite as remarkable so many months later, but there's still something to be said for the V35's design. Even beyond the lack of a notch, LG settled upon a really minimalist and understated look with the V30 series that many phones approach but don't nail down.The V35's dimensions haven't changed at all, but the top and bottom bezels are still thinner than what you find on most modern flagships. That makes a difference, as do the rounded metallic edges, the lack of a sizable camera hump on the back and the V35's extreme lightness, at 5.54 ounces.In fact, the V35 is actually a hair lighter than the G7 and more than half an ounce lighter than the iPhone X. That might not seem like a big deal, but you feel the difference from the moment you pick up the phone. And the lighter weight contributes to the overriding sensation of simplicity inherent in the V35, something that escapes most of its competitors.The design cedes center stage to the V35's edge-to-edge pOLED (plastic OLED) screen. LG's OLED display tech still isn't quite up to Samsung's par; the V35 has a peak full-screen brightness of 467 nits, which pales in comparison to the Galaxy S9+ and its 630 nits. There's also a slight grain effect on the V35 when you look really closely at solid colors, an effect that is imperceptible on the Galaxy duo.However, I'd much rather take the V35's display over the G7's LCD panel, which is incapable of offering comparably intense hues or perfect-pitch blacks. And any fears related to the Pixel 2 XL's LG-sourced pOLED screen are thankfully unfounded. The V35's display appears better calibrated to my eye and allows users to choose from among four profiles, ranging from muted to ultrasaturated, so everyone can customize the screen to their preference.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowIn terms of performance, the V35's internals place it within the upper echelon of Android handsets. LG's latest flagship scored 9,027 in Geekbench 4, coming very close to the 8GB OnePlus 6's score of 9,098.However, the V35 strangely wasn't as adept at pushing polygons, as its 4,139 result in 3D Mark's OpenGL ES 3.1 benchmark was notably off the OnePlus 6's score of 5,124. Fortunately, this deficit wasn't reflected in gaming. The V35 navigated PUBG Mobile with ease, even on the game's more-demanding graphics settings.If you have a proper set of headphones, you'll also appreciate the V35's quad digital-to-analog converter, which adds rich, atmospheric texture to any audio played back through the phone's 3.5-millimeter port. The G7 featured the same technology, and we're glad to see it become a staple of LG's premium line.The V35 is far from a perfect phone. But even if it were flawless, at $899 and tied to just two carriers, the price is exceptionally hard to justify.If it's the performance you like most, look to the OnePlus 6, which features the same processor and RAM combination but sells for $370 less — and is unlocked. If it's the OLED screen, check out the $719 Galaxy S9, whose panel is more impressive. The V35's other notable selling points, like its IP68 water resistance and microSD slot, appear in countless other Android phones.And then there's the issue of storage; the V35 has only 64GB of it, and the system uses up roughly 13GB of that before you even take the phone out of the box. That's quite a small amount of storage for a device that starts at $899, and it'll only get smaller with successive updates.Although the V35 runs Android Oreo out of the box, this is not quite the latest revision of the OS. Like the G7, the V35 ships with Android 8.0, rather than 8.1. It's a small distinction, but nevertheless a frustrating one, given the price of the phone. And it's hard to imagine that those updates are going to come fast and frequently for this AT&T-exclusive model.As for the cameras, the V35's new setup still left something to be desired compared to our top phone for photography, the Pixel 2 XL. The ""ThinQ"" part of the name refers to LG's AI-assisted smart technologies, and in this case, the V35 uses machine learning to enhance photos via scene and object recognition.Of course, the V35 isn't the first phone to do this — though, in my experience, it is one of the worst. LG's AI enhancements tend to override natural scenes with boatloads of artificial processing and boosted colors, as happened in this oddly yellow selfie taken with the Portrait filter auto-applied.A similar phenomenon occurred when I turned the V35's dual cameras on a friend at Brooklyn's Pier 6. The V35's white balance seems a bit off here, and details within the focal point seem overly soft as well. Despite a nice bokeh applied to the background, the sky is overexposed in LG's effort — a problem the Pixel avoids.When I homed in on everything behind my friend, though, the V35 delivered a shot that was certainly brighter than the Pixel's but noticeably more washed out as a consequence. The f/1.6 aperture of the V35's main lens definitely works to the handset's advantage in darker scenes, but this is a double-edged sword. Sometimes, the V35's camera kills the contrast you do want, glossing over the shadows that add depth, life and drama to a photo. As a result, the Pixel can achieves a gorgeous sunset, while the V35 criminally blows out the same shot.However, the V35 will provide a wide-angle perspective that most phones (outside of LG's own) won't offer, so at least there's that.Finally, although LG has made strides with battery life in the G7 and now the V35, the company's devices still pale in comparison to those of its rivals in longevity. The V35 lasted 9 hours and 11 minutes on a charge in our battery test, in which the phone streamed web pages endlessly on AT&T's LTE network.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThat result was somewhat surprising, as the V35 has the same 3,300-mAh battery as the V30 and the latter phone couldn't even break 6 and a half hours. As happy as we are to see LG make strides in efficiency, the V35 still lasted several hours less than many of its competitors, including the iPhone X (10:49), Galaxy S9+ (10:59) and Pixel 2 XL (12:09).As an upgrade to LG's ""other"" flagship, the V35 is a serviceable smartphone. It is as powerful as its contemporaries, has a solid OLED display, and maintains a featherweight edge-to-edge design that doesn't feel as overengineered as your typical premium handset nowadays — and that includes the LG G7 ThinQ.However, the V35 is also something nobody asked for, and it brings nothing novel to the market. Say what you like about the G7's derivative looks, but at least it's a new expression for LG. The V35, however, is a rehash of a phone that came out last year, and LG has since released an even more advanced version in the V40. Many of the reasons you might've bought a V30 last fall — whether it was the improved audio or the wide-angle perspective — are popping up in other, cheaper phones that don't require you to be an AT&T or a Project Fi customer while parting with $899. The V35 is just fine, but for the sacrifices you'll have to make, just fine isn't good enough.Credit: Tom's Guide"
161,Xperia XZ1,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-xperia-xz1,review-5046.html","Editors' Note: We updated this review on Nov. 20 to note that Sony has since come out with Xperia XZ2 and XZ3 phones. If you're looking for a more compact phone with a screen about the same size as the Xperia XZ1's 5.2-inch display, look at our guide to the best small phones currently available.You hear the sentiment often these days that most smartphones look too similar. But you'd never mistake Sony's newest range-topping Xperia XZ1 for anything else on the market. Sony has picked up right where it left off with 2016's Xperia XZ family, eschewing modern design trends and features for an unapologetically sharp, flat slab of a flagship that keeps the bells and whistles to a minimum.The result is nothing if not distinctive. Unfortunately, the Xperia XZ1 doesn't always stand out for the right reasons.The Xperia XZ1 debuted at $699 and comes in just one configuration: 64GB of storage paired with 4GB of RAM. In the United States, you can buy the device unlocked from Best Buy and Amazon. It's compatible with only GSM networks, including T-Mobile and AT&T.The XZ1's price has fallen since we originally posted this review earlier this year, as Sony has come out with newer flagships, including one — the Xperia XZ2 Compact — that we actually prefer to the XZ1, thanks to its more modern design and above-average battery life.MORE: Best Small Phones: Top Picks 5 inches or LessWhile many new smartphones have opted for wider and nearly bezel-free screens, Sony's Xperia XZ1 defies this shift with its striking rectangular form and generous bezels above and below the display. The result is a handset that resembles a shrunken version of the old Xperia Z4 tablet from way back in 2015, as well as generations of bygone Sony flagships.The Venus Pink Xperia XZ1 we tested measures 5.8 x 2.9 x 0.3 inches, features a durable exterior made from anodized aluminum and is rated IP68 water resistant. A sheet of Gorilla Glass 5 protects the screen but falls away slightly at the perimeter to mesh with the device's curved sides. Along the phone's right side, you'll find a recessed power button — a hallmark of Sony's flagships — as well as a volume rocker that is simply too short and small to help you discern up from down. At least the top edge of the phone bears a headphone jack, something disappearing from flagships these days.One not-so-little thing about that power button: In markets outside the United States, that key doubles as a fingerprint sensor. Sony has once again disabled that layer of security for U.S. customers. Whatever the reason, it was an inexcusable omission in last year's Xperia XZ line that sadly hasn't changed.The Xperia XZ1 is also available in Moonlit Blue, Warm Silver and black. Interestingly, Sony colored the glass to match the hue of the aluminum on all three nonblack models. We wish we saw this more often from companies like Apple and Google, as it gives the front of the device some added personality.The XZ1 is wider than the Galaxy S8 (5.9 x 2.7 x 0.3 inches) by 0.2 inches, so getting a comfortable hold is difficult if you have small hands. The S8 has a bigger screen than the XZ1 but a different aspect ratio, so it winds up being narrower than Sony's phone.If you can manage to fit the XZ1 in your pants pocket, you may feel a jab from one of the phone's sharp edges, but that ultimately depends on how tight your pants are. (No judgement!) The looser pockets you'll find on sweaters or jackets do perfectly fine in containing this imposing handset.Surprisingly, the Xperia's long frame is fairly lightweight, coming in at only 5.4 ounces. That's 1.4 ounces lighter than Sony's Xperia XZ Premium (6.8 ounces) and a hair lighter than the Galaxy S8 (5.5 ounces).The 5.2-inch, 1080p LCD display inside the Xperia XZ1 may sound unremarkable on paper, but it's a nice enough panel for a high-end handset. Just don't expect it to blow you away like the OLED screens featured on some of its competitors.It's a bit strange for Sony to remain committed to LCD displays in smartphones considering it gave the world its very first OLED television exactly a decade ago and continues to produce them today. The XZ1's HDR-enabled screen is colorful and crisp, and like with its predecessors, you can customize this phone's display mode to get more- or less-saturated hues. But the XZ1 can't deliver the broad contrast ratio and perfect blacks that dazzle Galaxy Note 8 users or get quite as bright as the iPhone X.The XZ1 demonstrated a peak full-screen brightness of 477 nits, compared to 574 nits for the iPhone X. Sony's phone covered 158 percent of the sRGB color space in its stock display mode and registered a Delta-E color-accuracy rating of 0.36 (where numbers closer to 0 are better). These are perfectly satisfactory numbers, but with rumors swirling that Sony will finally join the ranks of Apple, Samsung, LG and Google and toss in an OLED display on its 2018 flagships, the XZ1's screen still feels like the best of old technology, rather than where the industry is headed.MORE: Best Smartphone Cameras 2018While other phone makers have taken to giving their devices two lenses, Sony has stuck with a single camera on the back of the Xperia XZ1. It's a 19-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture and electronic image stabilization only — no optical here. For selfies, there's a 13-MP, front-facing shooter at your disposal.The Xperia XZ1's camera app isn't loaded with a bevy of shooting modes and special features, which is actually a relief after experiencing the overly cluttered interfaces of competing flagships. We also appreciate that Sony continues to include a dedicated hardware key for the shutter, for those who prefer the precision and tactile feedback of a physical button. However, some users might lament the lack of a Portrait Mode as found on many of the latest premium phones.Taking our unit outdoors along with the 12-MP Galaxy S8 for some comparison shots, we saw that the two phones excelled in different respects. In this first shot, inside a window-lit coffee shop on a brisk but sunny afternoon, the XZ1 had a hard time reining in the intense light falling in from the storefront. However, the phone handled the rest of the frame better than the Samsung device, with its dim exposure and grainy, fuzzy details. The Xperia's white balance also appeared more neutral.Turning around for a close-up on some items for sale, I found that the XZ1 claimed the dimmer, noisier shot, failing to compensate for the poorly lit conditions. The Galaxy S8 bore slightly warmer colors and better exposed the entirety of the scene. And its narrower field-of-view didn't distort the edges of the frame quite as significantly.Stepping outside the cafe, I encountered this late afternoon scene, which was challenging for both phones, mostly because of the sunlight breaking from behind the house at the left. The XZ1 maintained its cooler tint, and those extra megapixels definitely helped the phone pull out more detail down toward the horizon. But a heavy glare also clouded much of the final result. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S8's shot proved to be a bit darker overall, especially in the shadows, as seen in the porch of the blue house and the potted plant on the street corner.Finally, the Xperia's wide-angle selfie cam delivered a clear portrait that delicately painted the sky's blue gradient in a way the Galaxy S8's 8-megapixel shooter simply couldn't, although the Sony's photo could have been a tinge brighter.Videographers may appreciate a feature that Sony brought over from the Xperia XZ Premium. Like that phone, the XZ1 can film super-slow-motion video at 960 frames per second and 720p resolution, far smoother than the 240-fps mode in the iPhone 8 and X.Capturing video at this speed is effortless: Simply tap a button while recording video to hone in on a specific moment. Just make sure you're shooting outdoors or in well-lit surroundings, as this mode really turns down the brightness out of the camera feed. It's a beneficial feature, but useful only in scenes with a great deal of movement.The Xperia XZ1 features Qualcomm's high-performing Snapdragon 835 processor to compete with other current Android flagships. The XZ1 showed no hints of lag when we put that powerful chip to use browsing the web, streaming video and playing our favorite games.In the Geekbench 4 test for overall system performance, the XZ1 scored a whopping 6,506, outperforming the Galaxy S8 (6,295), Google Pixel 2 (6,282) and Xperia XZ Premium (6,206). The OnePlus 5T earned a slightly higher mark of 6,674, though our OnePlus review unit pulled in that score with 8GB of RAM. It's pretty impressive that the XZ1 was able to rank a close second with just half the memory.The Xperia's web-browsing performance isn't the speediest, notching a 65.70 in our JetStream 1.1 JavaScript test. Both the Galaxy S8 (70.26) and XZ Premium (70.04) earned faster scores, though the XZ1 performed slightly better than the OnePlus 5T (62.08).Still, Sony's latest phone dominated in our video-editing test, transcoding a 2-minute 4K video clip to 1080p using the Adobe Premiere Clip app. The XZ1 processed the file in 2 minutes and 55 seconds, which is actually dead even with the Pixel 2.In terms of graphics, the XZ1 scored 38,730 in the 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test, proving that this phone can handle simpler games, like Episode and Futurama: Worlds of Tomorrow as well as more-demanding titles, like Modern Combat 5.The Xperia XZ1 sports a 2,700-mAh battery that supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0, good for users who don't want to wait long for their phone to re-juice. The Xperia's battery also features Qnovo Adaptive Charging technology to extend the device's lifespan (unlike Apple's iPhones) and Smart Stamina, which disables nonessential apps when the battery runs down to 15 percent or lower.Despite all that, the phone lasted 9 hours and 45 minutes in the Tom's Guide battery test, which consists of continuous web surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network. While that showing is in line with the average result for smartphones, it doesn't compare to the times from other flagship Android phones, like the Galaxy S8 (10:39), Google Pixel 2 (11:07) and OnePlus 5T (11:22), all of which carry bigger batteries. Still, the XZ1's time improved on that of its pricier older sibling, the Xperia XZ Premium, by 23 minutes (9:22).It might seem like table stakes to launch a phone with the latest version of Android on board, but it happens less often than you'd hope. For that reason, we have to hand it to Sony for releasing the Xperia XZ1 with Android 8.0 Oreo, rather than promising an update at an undetermined future date as the overwhelming majority of phone makers have done.Mind you, it's not quite Oreo in its stock form. Sony has included its own launcher, which allows you to expand the grid of apps on the home screen, change the transition animations that appear between pages and even modify icon size. The XZ1 also includes Sony's stock apps, like Album, Music, Video, Sketch and Xperia Lounge, the latter of which functions as a Sony-curated collection of games, media, themes and so on. Even the Settings menu is just subtly different.It's certainly not as much of a departure from Google's OS as you'll find in LG's or Huawei's heavily customized interfaces. But it still feels like change for the sake of change, not to mention that the interface looks quite dated, too. Much like its exterior aesthetic, the Xperia's UI has remained pretty much the same over the past three years.However, one special feature you won't find anywhere else is Sony's 3D Creator.This app uses the XZ1's rear camera to scan faces, food and objects, which can then be placed in photos and videos as AR models, or even 3D printed if you have the appropriate hardware or access to a 3D printing service.In practice, 3D Creator is hit or miss. Slowly panning a camera around a stationary object to model it is much, much harder than it sounds, especially when the object in question is extremely large or small and space is tight. But when it works, the effect is hilarious and almost magical. The app will direct you to scan a person's head first, which I quickly found was the easiest thing to scan; stuffed animals and model cars proved considerably more difficult. You'll quickly run out of things to do with a textured polygonal bust of your best friend, but it'll be a blast the first time you mess around with it.There's no Android flagship quite like Sony's latest, but in this case, that's not a particularly good thing. You must acknowledge the Xperia's processing prowess and Oreo support, but aside from that, the competition simply offers more.The Samsung Galaxy S8 manages a larger OLED screen and a form that's easier to use with one hand. The Google Pixel 2 XL is every bit as fast as the XZ1, but it sports class-leading battery life and arguably the best camera in any smartphone today (at least, any phone that doesn't come from Cupertino). The OnePlus 5T promises more RAM, a second lens and other noteworthy benefits for hundreds of dollars less. And, of course, all three of those handsets have fingerprint sensors.Moreover, the strides Sony has made aren't relevant to the average user. Slow-motion video recording and 3D Creator are fun and technologically exciting, but they're novelties at heart. Where it counts, the Xperia XZ1 is simply outmatched.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
162,Huawei Mate 20 Pro,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/huawei-mate-20-pro,review-5844.html","Cameras on phones have gotten exponentially better in recent years, and Huawei has been one of the pioneers leading the charge. The P20 Pro was a camera king, making use of Leica-branded lenses.Alongside the Google Pixel 3, the P20 Pro remains the camera phone to beat — and that's exactly what Huawei hopes to do with the new Huawei Mate 20 Pro. And, boy, does it have fun trying — complete with a design that puts Samsung on notice, an in-display fingerprint sensor and a battery so big that you’ll have enough juice left over to wirelessly charge other phones.The news that the Mate 20 Pro won't be sold in the US is utterly disappointing. Nevertheless, if you can get your hands on this Android flagship, you'll have yourself one of the best smartphones money can buy.  Update Nov. 14: The Mate 20 Pro is now available for sale on eBay for $899.The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is available from a variety of networks in the U.K., and it's priced at £899 (about $1,150). Huawei originally announced that the handset won't be available through any carriers in the U.S., but eBay has begun selling the device for a very reasonable $899.99.The Huawei Mate Pro 20 has a beautiful design. Yes, it has a notch, but this is the only blight on an otherwise stunning front display. The bezel at the top and the bottom of the device is barely noticeable. The curved sides of the OLED screen may add nothing but a pretty look, but they do that very well.Within the notch, Huawei includes a front-facing camera with a 24-MP (f/2.0) lens that can read RGB, a flood illuminator and the 3D depth-sensing camera. Oh, and there is a tiny LED light that glows when charging the device and for notifications.The very top of the Mate 20 Pro features an IR sensor. On the right-hand side, there's a volume rocker and an on/off button. That button on our Emerald Green handset is painted shiny red. (In addition to Emerald Green, the Mate 20 Pro comes in Black, Twilight and Pink Gold.) The left-hand side of the device is kept completely clear of buttons.The bottom of the device houses a USB-C input, a SIM-card tray (which can also take a bespoke NanoSD card, created by Huawei and sold separately). And that's it — there is no 3.5mm jack, unfortunately. But when you have the likes of OnePlus (once staunch advocates of the headphone jack) drifting away from this technology with the new OnePlus 6T, you know that its days are numbered. Huawei includes a dongle in the box to transform any cans into USB-C compatible headphones.The Mate 20 Pro measures just 6.2 x 2.8 x 0.33 inches (157.8 x 72.3 x 8.6 mm) and weighs 6.7 ounces (189 grams), which is lighter than the 7.1-ounce Samsung Galaxy Note 9.In the hand, the phone feels good. On the Midnight Blue and Emerald Blue models, you have the option to either get a smooth glass back or something called hyper optical pattern on the glass. Huawei bills this latter option as akin to vinyl. The groove is unfortunately a little too fine to be truly compared to a record, but there is a definite scratchy feel when you rub a fingernail across it — rub your finger over it, however, and it feels really smooth.The phone's glass back means wireless Qi charging is on board and along with it something quite special — the ability to reverse wireless charge from the device. This means that any Qi-friendly phone can charge off the Huawei Mate 20 Pro — even the iPhone X range. That is quite something.MORE: 6 Reasons You Should Skip the iPhone XS for iPhone XRTopping off the design specs is the fact that the Huawei Mate 20 Pro is IP68 water resistant. That means that it can survive far more than a drop in a puddle. It can be placed in 2 meters of water for 30 minutes without fear it will stop working.The Huawei Mate Pro 20 has a 6.39-inch AMOLED screen with a 3120 x 1440 resolution —  this resolution is higher than the Google Pixel 3 XL and the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (both 2960 x 1440). As you would expect, the display is stunning to look at. Images are crisp, and brightness is at a level that doesn’t hurt the eyes while still looking exceptional. You quickly get all the information you need, even if you are only glancing at the screen.As a default, Huawei doesn't prime the screen for full quality, opting for a default of FHD+ (2340 x 1080). To change this, go into the display settings and select image resolution to opt for either HD+ (1560 x 720) or WQHD+ (3120 x 1440) instead. But unless you're consuming rich media, you'll probably be perfectly happy with FHD+. Changing the resolution to WQHD+ does make a noticeable difference, though — to both the quality of the screen and the battery life.Watching movies on the device is a joy. Netflix pinged on the device. We watched a number of episodes of GLOW on Netflix and the '80s neon vibe was as vibrant as we hoped.MORE: What Is OLED?When it came to testing the Mate 20 Pro's screen in our lab, the phone registered a decent 190 percent of the sRGB color gamut. This beat the Pixel 3 XL's 170.2 percent and is much better than the iPhone XS Max (123 percent). The Galaxy Note 9 still rules with 224 percent, though. Color accuracy is a little off: The Mate 20 Pro's panel produced a Delta-E score of 1.06, compared with 0.35 for the Pixel 3 XL. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)Brightness is a relatively muted 393 nits. That beats the Pixel 3 XL (362 nits). But other flagship phones — notably, the iPhone XS (606 nits) and the Galaxy Note 9 (604 nits) — are much brighter.You won't find a fingerprint sensor on the back of the Mate 20 Pro. Instead, it's underneath the display panel. This takes a little time to set up (the phone needs to get a 3D imprint of your finger, so take a while to make sure it has all the data it needs and requires numerous prints for this), but the feature works really well.It's pretty speedy — with a press lasting for around a second to turn the screen on. This process could be speeded up, though, especially when you look at how fast the OnePlus 6T unlocks with its embedded fingerprint sensor. Using the Mate 20 Pro, there were a few times that I couldn't quite hit the right spot for the fingerprint to work, though, overall, it's pretty responsive.The Mate 20 Pro has no visible speaker grill. That's because the audio is piped through the USB-C slot. It's a design wonder that this not only works but works well. Sound is clear, but not booming when turned up — when there is a cable attached, sound is slightly dampened but there's nothing significant to note. As with the Huawei Mate 10, the top speaker is front facing to go alongside the bottom-firing speaker.Dolby Atmos is available through the handset, which is welcome, but there were some annoyances with the audio in general. When skipping through something like Twitter, which has a constant stream of autoplay videos, anytime one of those would threaten to start, there was an annoying audio ""pop"" from the phone's speakers. And this was when I was skimming past and not actually interacting with the videos. It was certainly noticeable and quite annoying, although it didn't seem to occur when I had Bluetooth headphones connected.Flip over the Mate 20 Pro to see where the magic happens. You haven't seen a camera array like this on a phone before. Huawei has made a big deal out of its three-lens setup situated at the near-top of the back of the device. When looking at the back, the lens is on the left-hand side, with three cameras cradling it, making a square. The array sticks out a little, but the lip is negligible.The camera setup comprises: a 40-MP main (f/1.8), an 8-MP telephoto (f/2.4) and a 20-MP ultra-wide (f/2.2) lens. They combine to make one of the best cameras we have ever tested on a phone, nestling alongside the P20 Pro for image quality and manual control.Let’s get the elephant out of the room first: the Mate 20 Pro lacks the 20-MP monochrome sensor found on the P20 Pro. This lens let you shoot black-and-white images without any manipulation needed. On the Mate 20 Pro, that's replaced with a simple black-and-white mode. In our tests, the images taken in black and white looked good but they certainly lacked the sharpness you would get if the camera had a dedicated monochrome lens. While that's a loss, Huawei replaced it with a new 20-MP ultrawide (f/2.2) lens.As we took test shots with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, the AI camera assistant did a good job guiding us to make the best shots possible. As with other recent phones, Huawei has made artificial intelligence a central part of the camera on the Mate 20 Pro.Given that focus on AI, it's surprising that you have to go into the settings to turn on the Mate 20 Pro's Master AI features. Once you do, the Mate 20 Pro will automatically find the best shooting mode for you. The P20 could do that, too, but only for a hundred or so ""scenes"" — that's been upped to around 1,500 on the Mate 20 Pro.While the total's impressive, the feature wasn't always as accurate as we would have hoped. A number of times we got Cloudy Sky as an option when there wasn't actually a cloud in the sky. When the Mate 20’s AI features do work, though, it's decent. Picking out autumn leaves in a setting shows how granular these scene modes go.Other camera features in the Mate 20 include 4D predictive focus, which snaps images before and after you press the shutter to find the best image. The Top Shot feature on the new Pixel 3 works the same way. Given you can look at all of the images taken by the Pixel 3 in this mode, something you can't do on the Mate 20 Pro, I think the Pixel 3 uses this functionality better.  The camera setup on the Mate 20 Pro supports a 3x optical zoom (something the single-lens Pixel 3 does not have), and thanks to the ultrawide angle lens you can get an ultrawide shot that Huawei calls a 0.6x zoom. I got some nice, detailed shots with the 0.6x zoom, such as a wide vista featuring trees and foliage in a local park. The extended image brings more foreground to the shots, making things look nice and epic.When I zoomed in past the optical zoom limit for a 5x zoom, there wasn't quite the jaggies I was expecting. While colors lost their richness, the close-up images of a tree (that was also the subject of the 0.6x landscape shot) still held a decent amount of detail. The 5x zoom shots I captured were certainly usable, thanks to the optical image stabilization built into the lens.The ultrawide angle lens also doubles as a macro zoom and the image we took of a mushroom was incredibly detailed up close (2.5 cm). This is certainly one of the best macro modes we have ever seen on a camera phone.The Mate 20 Pro features a number of different modes to take the guesswork out of fiddling with settings. You'll be particularly interested in Night Mode, which I found effective in low-light settings: the outcome is akin to shooting at night with a high-end compact. In particular, an image of a New York street at night looked fantastic. There was blurring in the foreground but this was only due to cars whizzing past on the road, coupled with the slower shutter speed, but this enhanced the vibrancy of the image.I also had a lot of fun with Portrait mode, capturing the best image of my son I've ever taken as autumn leaves fell in the background. The Mate 20 Pro's camera captured him in perfect detail with the bokeh surroundings blurring enough to make the shot look dynamic but it's quite subtle. Without any processing, the colors of the image absolutely sparkle, and it’s a shot I will forever cherish.We wanted to see how the Mate 20 Pro's triple cameras performed against the lone rear lens on the Pixel 3. As you can see in the comparison shot of Grand Central Station, the Pixel does a better job brightening the shadows and darkening the highlights. But it feels like the Pixel can get oversaturated with respect to its color. The Mate 20 Pro opts for more realistic hues.Again, the low-light functionality of the Mate 20 Pro was apparent when I took some shots inside a bar where much of the light came from two downward spotlights. Compared with the iPhone XR's shot of the same place, there's more of a punch to the image and the light available in the shot shines through.When I compared the Mate's Portrait Mode to the Pixel 3 XL while shooting a colleague, Caitlin, the Mate 20 Pro image looked a little too zoomed out and the blur was too strong. These elements do make the picture look a little more Photoshopped. Still, I think the Mate 20 produces a more standout portrait image, given the shots I got of my son. It looks like the perspective favors some angles rather than others.Video captured by the Mate 20 Pro impresses as well, as the phone can shoot at 4k in both h.264 and h.265. Huawei have added some fun ""live"" effects with the ability to desaturate an image and leave certain aspects with color (the Sin City effect). While this feature works, it does judder on occasion and the Mate 20's camera did lose the subject a few times, which meant the whole video turned B&W.The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is a powerhouse in the battery department, with a whopping 4,200 mAh battery. By comparison, the iPhone XS has a 3,174 mAh battery, so the Mate 20 Pro promises plenty of battery life.In real-world use, the Mate 20 Pro lasted a day and then some. In light use, we would end up with around 55 to 65 percent still left. If we used the phone for something heavier, such as gaming, streaming or imaging processing, then the phone's battery would drain faster. But we never went to the end of the day with less than 20 percent on the battery.Note that we enjoyed the long battery life when the Mate 20 Pro was set on its default resolution. Boost it to WQHD+ (3120x1440), and you can expect the Mate 20 to consume more power.In the Tom's Guide Battery Test — which consists of continuous web surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network — the battery lasted 10 hours and 9 minutes. While this is better than the average smartphone's time (9:48), we were expecting more here given the size of the Mate 20 Pro’s battery and Huawei's track record with power management. (Both the Mate 10 Pro and the P20 Pro are among the longest lasting phones we've ever tested.)The Mate 20's Pro result puts it a little behind the OnePlus 6T  (10 hours and 23 minutes), quite a bit behind the iPhone XR and Note 9 (11 hours and 25 minutes) but ahead of the Google Pixel 3 XL (9 hours and 30 minutes).There's fast charging on board, too. If you use the 40-watt Super Charger included with the phone, Huawei says you can get to a 70 percent charge in just 30 minutes. Our testing backed up that claim. Given this is 20 percent faster than most smart-charging phones on the market, this is really impressive.The Mate 20 Pro is one of the first phones to feature the Kirin 980, Huawei's 7-nanometer chipset, which promises more powerful performance with less battery consumption.You first notice the speed when you fire up the Mate 20 Pro. The apps I use the most — Twitter, Facebook, a train times app, Spotify, all the Google docs — all open quickly. You can easily switch between them, too, thanks to the Mate 20's card layout for the apps that you have open. It's obvious to see the 6GB RAM doing its thing in the device, as I never had to wait longer than needed to load an app up.Gaming-wise, there is a neat bit of functionality hidden in the Battery menu. Switch on Performance Mode and all device settings are switched to Maximum Performance for when you want to get the most out of something that's a little more CPU-intensive. We tried this with Asphalt 9 and the console-quality graphics were handled well by the phone; there wasn't any jitter in the game play, although the handset did warm up when this mode was selected.Huawei says to expect 75 percent higher CPU performance, compared with the 970 and 58 percent better power efficiency. Our benchmarks revealed a number of impressive tidbits.The Mate 20 Pro's Geekbench 4 Multi-core score (a metric for overall performance) was a fantastic 9,973. That's far ahead of Snapdragon 845-powered phones, including Asus' tricked-out ROG Phone (9,224), not to mention RAM-heavy phones like the OnePlus 6T (8,972) and the Galaxy Note 9 (8,876). The A12 Bionic chip powering the Apple iPhone XS Max (11,515), the iPhone XS (11,420) and the iPhone XR (11,312) remains the mobile speed king, though.On 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme Unlimited test (which looks at graphics performance), the Mate 20 Pro hit 4,220. This is a touch lower than the Pixel 3 XL's score of 4,396 and iPhone XR's result of 4,416, while well behind the OnePlus 6T (5,183).MORE: A Guide to No Contract and Prepaid Phone PlansHuawei has been clever and separated its four Cortex A76 cores — it has two cores running at 2.6GHz and the other set at 1.92GHz. As each set uses its own power, even when the CPU hits high usage, there’s still gas left in the tank. As the numbers show, it doesn't quite hit the top marks in its category, but the performance is still solid in everyday use.First, the good news: the Mate 20 Pro is right up-to-date with its software, as it's running Android Pie modified to its EMUI 9.0 interface. It's certainly not as in-your-face or childish as other phone makers' Android skins, but it still has its foibles and we have some issues with it.EMUI is a little bit fussier and confusing than Android, and the Huawei-based additions, while good, just replace what are better Android services. When I first started playing around with the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, I immediately wanted to change the screen layouts. Much of the changes you can make are in Home Screen Settings. (You change the look of the home screen in Home Screen Style.)Huawei has done a decent job of menu-tidying on the Mate 20 Pro, with the phone maker claiming to have cut the amount of clutter in the menus by 10 percent or so. But it still feels too fussy for my liking. Some options that you would expect to find in certain menus just aren't there, so I seemed to spend a lot of of my time bouncing from setting screen to setting screen, figuring out how to change things to my liking.EMUI lacks an intuitiveness that frustrates. For instance, the quick-search function can be found by swiping down on any part of the screen, except for the top part of the screen, which will take you into the standard Android dropdown menu. And when pinching and zooming on an image in WhatsApp, the phone would constantly ask if I wanted to use HiVision — Huawei's version of Google Lens. Personally, I'd rather have Google Lens baked in as on the Pixel handsets and OnePlus 6T, but at least HiVision was a lot of fun when using it to see more information about certain objects and the like (when I actually wanted to use it, that is).HiVision can also be accessed as part of the camera via its symbol in the top-left corner. The feature didn't work that well all the time, but it was pretty intuitive using HiVision to shop. Pointing the Mate 20 Pro's camera at a guitar gave me myriad options and places to buy one — but just any guitar, and not a specific make or model.MORE: OnePlus 6T vs. Pixel 3: Why OnePlus Beats Google at AndroidAnother feature, Digital Balance, is a screen time management feature and will tell how long you have spent on specific apps. It's a popular feature for phones at the moment: iOS 12 has something similar called Screen Time while Android 9 has a version of its own called Digital Wellbeing, which is still in beta and offers similar features.Another big change — and a welcome one — is card swiping. Click the square box at the bottom of the Mate 20 Pro, and you can see the apps you have been using in a card format, letting you quickly swipe through them to get rid of what you don't need. It's a really intuitive and simple way to scroll through the apps you are using and see them all in one place. It's also here where you can split the Mate 20’s screen to have two apps working at once.The Huawei Mate 20 Pro is one of the best-looking handsets on the market, backed by a leading camera and a powerful battery. It's a phone that rarely falters in what you ask of it, there's enough grunt here to tear through the biggest of games and offer up such things as real-time video effects.The only letdown is the software, the occasional gimmick on show and the frustrating lack of a U.S. release. EMUI 9.0 frustrates more than it wows — I'd love to see a pure Android version of this phone. If you can overlook the overlay (or at least tinker with it as much as I did) and can stomach the top-end price for this ultra-premium handset, then you will be blessed with a camera phone that will be hard to beat.Credit: Marc Chacksfield/Tom's Guide"
163,Nokia 7.1,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/nokia-71,review-5921.html","Editor's note: The Nokia 7.1 is no longer sold and the Nokia 7.2 replaced it.Last year, the Nokia brand was reborn as an Android phone maker, courtesy of startup HMD Global. This year, HMD Global proved that it could make excellent affordable handsets, with an eye toward quality design and a premium software experience aided by full adoption of Google's Android One platform.Make no mistake — Nokia is back. But now, it needs to prove it has staying power against fierce midrange competition from Motorola and up-and-coming Chinese brands like Honor. And it’s pinned its hopes on the $349 Nokia 7.1.Budget phones have a reputation of making hefty sacrifices to hit lower prices. HMD Global evidently didn't fall into that trap, though, and instead set about producing one of the best smartphones for under $400 you'll find all year. The result is a device that thoroughly surprises, from its cameras to its HDR-equipped display and even its performance, which equals that of flagships from the not-too-distant past.Price and AvailabilityThe Nokia 7.1 costs $349 (£299), which gets you get a smartphone with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage. You can expand that by another 400GB with the use of a microSD card.MORE: The Best Unlocked SmartphonesIn the U.S., the device is GSM-unlocked. That means it can be used only on networks operating on the GSM standard, like T-Mobile, AT&T and Metro by T-Mobile, but not Verizon or Sprint. The Nokia 7.1 is offered in two colors: blue (with silver trim) and steel (with copper trim). Right now, Amazon and Best Buy are the only U.S. retailers carrying this phone.Nokia 7.1 SpecsThankfully, the Nokia 7.1 is not one of those budget phones. Sure, it employs the same glass-sandwich architecture that so many handsets do today, but this device manages to feel both solid and light. It consists of two slabs of slightly curved, strengthened glass joined by an ultrasturdy frame carved from 6000-series aluminum. The chamfered edges are finished with a metallic sheen — silver on the blue model or copper on the steel one — that plays beautifully off the matte sides.In fact, most of the Nokia 7.1 looks so good that it distracts you from the notch straddling the top edge of the display. Opposite that protrusion is a bottom bezel that is admittedly quite thick for a phone that has a notch. But, again, HMD Global has put so much care and attention into the overall product that I'm willing to forgive the iPhone X-aping design cues and any inconsistencies that come with them.Far too many budget phones skimp on design. The Nokia 7.1 is not one of them.The Nokia 7.1 feels absolutely great in the hand: light, just the right size and easy to flip around thanks to that curved glass. Unfortunately, though, should this device slip out of your grasp and into a puddle, the Nokia 7.1 hasn't been rated for water resistance. That's something you tend to find in more-expensive flagship models, though, to be fair, the Nokia 7.1 also has something you won't find in those pricier phones: a headphone jack. And unlike with some other cheap handsets, you won't need to part with NFC either, as the Nokia 7.1 supports transactions through Google Pay.Display: HDR for a bargainAt first blush, there's nothing about the Nokia 7.1's 5.8-inch, full-HD+ LCD display that stands out compared to the kinds of screens other midrange handsets offer. These days, it's not hard to find a decent LCD panel with a comparable resolution and similarly tall aspect ratio — and that's certainly something to be thankful for.You have to dig a little deeper to understand what makes the Nokia 7.1's panel a bit better than the rest. It's a collection of tech called PureDisplay, which in Nokia-speak, essentially means this screen complies with HDR10, the industry standard for high dynamic range that TV makers use. It also means that the phone can even convert SDR content to HDR, by boosting the contrast ratio and painting with a wider color gamut.The results speak for themselves. With the Enhanced HDR10 Display feature flipped on in the settings, the Nokia 7.1's screen paints mesmerizing hues, even though this is still an LCD panel at its core.MORE: 10 Cheap Android Smartphones (Under $250) Ranked Best to WorstI watched a trailer for the upcoming Bumblebee movie on both the Nokia 7.1 and the $249 Moto G6, one of the 7.1's midrange rivals, and simply put, there was no contest. On the Nokia, the titular Transformer's golden paint popped brightly off the backdrop of a verdant forest, and I could make out all the whirring gears and steel plates peeking out from between the robot's slabs of sheet metal, each glinting distinctively in the sunlight. Motorola's offering was simultaneously dimmer and more washed-out, and that device's visibility dropped off sharply as I tilted the phone in my hand to get some off-center perspectives.With the Enhanced HDR10 Display feature, the Nokia 7.1 paints mesmerizing hues, even though this is still an LCD panel at its core.By the numbers, the Nokia 7.1 sits comfortably among the upper echelon of LCD-powered, reasonably priced smartphones. The panel delivered a peak brightness of 452 nits; represented a wide, 164 percent swath of the sRGB spectrum; and served up accurate colors, with a Delta-E rating of 0.33. (Numbers closer to zero are better in that last test.) For reference, the Moto G6 turned in a 413-nit max, covered 113 percent for the sRGB gamut and offered nearly as accurate hues, with a 0.39 Delta-E score.Camera: Serviceable shots in a pinchYou can't launch a midrange phone with premium aspirations in 2018 without more than one lens for the camera, and well, we know how much Nokia likes its lenses.Thankfully, though, the Nokia 7.1 doesn't have five shooters on the back, all staring at subjects like the eyes of a demonic arachnid. There are just two at the rear of this $349 phone: a primary, 12-megapixel sensor with an ƒ/1.8 aperture, partnered with a 5-MP sensor for discerning depth.Those cameras take decent photos, too, as shown by the fall scene you see above, taken outside the New York Public Library. The shot from the Nokia 7.1 is universally sharper, with less distortion at the fringes of the frame, less blur and more-accurate white balance, which isn't as unnaturally warm as what the Moto G6 went produced.I also like the way the Nokia 7.1 handled this image of a nearby statue in comparison to the Motorola's approach. That phone brightened everything at the expense of glossing over the finer textural details, absolutely blowing out the marble steps at the base and smudging the buildings in the background.Back in our office, Nokia's Live Bokeh mode did an excellent job of separating my colleague Caitlin from her surroundings. The resulting portrait is crisp and clear, with accurate colors and a defined line between where the foreground stops and the blurred portion begins. The Moto G6 muddied up that isolation, putting soft edges around Caitlin's shoulders and completely omitting a large portion of her hair from the area of focus. The Motorola also greatly oversaturated things, especially the light near the ceiling.Finally, the Nokia 7.1 is the device I'd rather have in my pocket when I want to nab a selfie. This phone's 8-MP, front-facing shooter captures photos that fortunately lack the combination of artificial warmth and dramatic contrast that makes the Moto G6's shots seem lightly shopped.If you're in the market for a sub-$250 phone with a good camera, the Galaxy A20 is a capable alternative. It's not quite as well-rounded as the Nokia 7.1, but it's worth consideration.Performance: New midrange benchmarkAccording to Qualcomm, the Snapdragon 636 inside the Nokia 7.1 is 40 percent faster than the 630 chipset that delivered fine performance in the $269 Nokia 6.1.Couple that with the Nokia 7.1's 4GB of RAM, which is plenty for a device in this category and price range, and you get a phone that's adequately equipped to handle anything you throw at it.Well, almost — you won't be able to play cutting-edge games, like Madden NFL Overdrive, at their most demanding settings, as the device's 950 score in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test demonstrated. (Normally, we use Ice Storm Extreme for midrange handsets, but the Nokia 7.1 maxed out that test.)That said, I was still able to turn blisteringly quick laps in a Nissan Skyline GT-R in realistic racer Assoluto Racing. And I even picked off some enemies in PUBG Mobile on balanced settings, experiencing infrequent hiccups.MORE: Best Smartphones - Here Are the 10 Best Phones AvailableThose are encouraging testaments to performance, and when you turn to Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Nokia 7.1 is technically a little more powerful than Android flagships from two years back. The device delivered a multicore result of 4,953 points, roughly 800 points more than the original Google Pixel scored and more than  1,000 points above the slightly cheaper Nokia 6.1's mark.Battery: Nothing specialThe 3,060-mAh battery inside the Nokia 7.1 charges quickly but depletes relatively quickly, too. The phone lasted 7 hours and 41 minutes in our battery test, which tasks the phone with loading a succession of web pages endlessly over T-Mobile's LTE network until the device runs out of juice.Unfortunately, that time is a ways off from the impressive 10 hours and 34 minutes of the Nokia 6.1 or the 9 hours and 25 minutes that the Moto G6 turned in. However, those phones have smaller and lower-resolution screens, feature less-thirsty processors, and have less RAM, so the discrepancy isn't totally surprising.The Nokia 7.1 hurries to replenish itself when used with the stock adapter. The handset charged to 48 percent after just 30 minutes, which isn't too shabby. Don't let the glass back fool you, though; this phone can't charge wirelessly, even though its flagship-aping good looks may lead you to believe otherwise.Software: Quality experience, uncertain futureHMD Global has gone all in with Android One, using the unmodified version of Google's mobile OS across all Nokia's phones, and that's a great thing. It means users get a Pixel-like software experience no matter how much they spend. And it also guarantees updates to the latest versions of Android for ""at least"" two years (according to HMD Global), with security patches distributed for three years.However, rather surprisingly, the Nokia 7.1 does not come with Android 9 Pie installed out of the box. Our unit is still running Oreo, though we're told the phone will see a Pie update before November ends.The Nokia 7.1 raises the bar for budget phones in every sense.That's not too long a wait, though it has us somewhat skeptical of the Nokia 7.1's long-term upgrade path. Although Google has promised multiple software updates for Android One products, there's some ambiguity about whether that mandates a minimum of two letter upgrades over the handset's life.Worst case scenario, Nokia 7.1 owners might go no further than Android Q at the end of 2019, as they would have already burned one of their updates on the Pie release this fall. That's not confirmed by any means, and according to Google, Android One partners like HMD Global reserve the right to continue support after the initial 24 months if they wish. But budget phones tend to get shortchanged on software, so take that into consideration.MORE: Best Android Phones - Top Rated Smartphones You Can Buy ...At any rate, the Nokia 7.1 comes devoid of bloatware, just as you'd expect, and the phone even gets Google's Files Go storage-management app pr-installed. You do miss out on some Pixel-exclusive functionality, like Digital Wellbeing; Now Playing, which you use to identify songs from the lock screen; and the highly-praised Call Screen feature. But otherwise, this is stock Android in all its simple, light and fast glory.Bottom LineThe Nokia 7.1 raises the bar for budget phones in every sense. At $349, however, this handset may also raise the threshold for what can reasonably be considered a budget phone. Some might find it difficult to justify spending an extra $100 over the still very compelling Moto G6. Is Nokia's new device worth the extra cash worth?I reckon it is. HMD Global has packed a darling of a display in this phone, gifted it with class-leading performance that can keep pace with that of devices that were considered cutting edge just a year and a half ago, and thoughtfully partnered with Google to give users the best software experience possible. What's more, the company wrapped all of that in a design that obscures that this phone costs well less than half of what you'd pay for most flagships today.The Nokia 7.1 is blighted only by subpar battery life and an unfortunate shortcoming that affects most unlocked phones: incompatibility with half of the mobile networks in the U.S. For many buyers, though, I suspect those will be easy concessions to make — because in every other respect, this Nokia is a winner.Credit: Tom's Guide"
164,Red Hydrogen One,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/red-hydrogen-one,review-5882.html","Some doubted it would ever happen, but nearly a year after its initial targeted release date, the first smartphone from cinematography firm Red Digital Cinema is finally here. It's called the Hydrogen One, and marketing-speak aside, it really is unlike any phone you've ever seen before — for better and worse.Handsets with 3D displays and cameras that can see in 3D have been done before, but never like this. The Hydrogen One employs a unique approach that's fundamentally different from the likes of Nintendo's 3DS or even Amazon's long-forgotten Fire Phone. Plus, it's modular, so it's capabilities will only expand in the future.That said, the Hydrogen One isn't the once-and-for-all breakthrough that will endear 3D to the masses. And judging by its astronomical price and love-it-or-hate-it looks, it's not going to woo everyone, either. Give Red some credit: It could have tried to copy the iPhone X as so many other phone makers have tried and failed; instead it took serious risks. And like all great, risky first attempts in the tech world, the  result is equal parts promising and an expensive work-in-progress.At $1,295 for the base 128GB aluminum model, the Red Hydrogen One costs $50 more than a 256GB iPhone XS Max. Red has reiterated that a titanium variant is coming; it was supposed to be out for the phone's Nov. 2 launch, though manufacturing setbacks have pushed the release of that heavier, more durable version into 2019.When the titanium Hydrogen One does see the light of day, it will command a $300 premium over the aluminum model and come with twice the storage built in. All versions of the Hydrogen One support microSD cards up to 512GB in size.You have three options for buying a Hydrogen One — from AT&T, Verizon or unlocked. If you opt for an unlocked unit, you can take that device to practically any network, as it supports all bands used by both CDMA and GSM carriers.Smartphone design in 2018 could best be summed up by three trends: notches, shimmering glass backs and extra-tall 18:9 displays. And you won't find any of that on the Red Hydrogen One.Physically speaking, this device rejects every commonly held practice in consumer tech design. At 9.27 ounces, it's nearly a whole 2 ounces heavier than the iPhone XS Max, and it’s larger in every dimension, too. The 5.7-inch, 16:9 display is flanked by massive metal bezels that carry stereo speakers and a series of conspicuous apertures for the front-facing cameras, ambient light sensors and a notification LED.Even the edges are unusual. They're scalloped in such a way that they look as though they've been fashioned out of rubber even though they haven't. Grasping the Hydrogen One's deep grooves feels almost like spacing your fingers between the laces of a football. Unlike a football, though, we wouldn't suggest tossing it around — any game of catch is guaranteed to end in a concussion.We haven't even gotten to the phone's backside yet, which is clad in two Kevlar panels and even more metal. Strewn among the discordant surfaces is a massive protruding dual-camera housing, Red's signature jewel-like emblem and a small collection of pogo pins that will be used to enable modularity in the future.I don't like the design of this phone. I think it's gaudy, cumbersome, takes itself too seriously and — aside from those sticky grooves — makes no concessions for ease of use. But then, I'm clearly not the customer Red had in mind, because a certain contingent of Tom's Guide staffers absolutely love the way the Hydrogen One looks. Our photo editor Shaun says the exterior reminds him of old-school, 35-millimeter cameras — gear that was ""built to last,"" he says. And given Red's history, that's certainly no coincidence.Interestingly though, for all the Hydrogen One's rugged looks, the phone isn't military-spec certified (as some beefy Android devices, like Samsung's Galaxy S Active series are) and there's no water resistance, either. That's a little disappointing, though the ultra-rigid build quality and cocktail of materials bolstering the chassis leave little doubt that Red's monster of a handset will survive a tumble.The hype for the Hydrogen One's 4-view holographic display has overtaken any and all reasonable expectations. That surely must be exciting for Red, but probably a little worrisome, too.On the one hand, people are legitimately jazzed to discover what this crazy new screen technology can do. On the other, Red may have built the mystique to unattainable heights by continually refusing to show the front of the device during previews and issuing lofty claims — like, for example, that the Hydrogen One would ""change the future of personal communication forever.""Allow me to put that proclamation to rest: the Hydrogen One's 3D screen isn't going to change the future of personal communication — at least not in its current iteration. Still, the tech behind the scenes is quite impressive. Red has sourced the display from a startup called Leia, which has pioneered a system that embeds a clear substrate under the glass to redirect light and create the illusion of depth. This layer is switched on and off dynamically by the Hydrogen One depending on the  on-screen content, and when it's off, the display functions as a conventional 2D one.Launch a 4-view compatible game, video or image, and the phone instantly switches into 3D mode. The effect is jarring at first — the substrate introduces quite a bit of pixelation and chromatic aberration, almost like a light film of grease has been splashed over the top of the glass. But the 3D sensation definitely comes across, and the way subjects in the foreground leap off the display is  evocative of a hologram.Red's Hydrogen Network app houses an assortment of 4-view videos, from Planet Earth-inspired short films to slow-motion clips of Olympic swimmers. There I watched one video of a professional BMX rider bounding about a derelict industrial site in Scotland. The Hydrogen One's display conveyed a sense of depth, where it felt as though the rider were launching off the panel with every trick. Some of the tighter shots with dramatic zoom really drove home the immersion, as the 4-view technology enables a subtle parallax effect that allows you to tilt the phone laterally without losing the perspective.However, 3D on any screen — glasses or not — has never been a totally comfortable experience, and I'm afraid that day hasn't arrived yet for Red, either. While you don't have to hold the Hydrogen One at a specific angle in front of your eyes for the trick to work, you can very easily find yourself ""caught between"" perspectives in a sense, which tears a rift through the picture and doesn't really create an immersive experience.Additionally, all 4-view content is not prepared equally. For example, those videos I mentioned are relatively easy to watch without any fatigue, as are 3D photos taken with the Hydrogen One's dual cameras. (Red also tells us it's inked deals with a number of film studios to offer exclusive 4-view versions of blockbuster movies.) However, the same cannot be said for the special 4-view version of Asphalt 8: Airborne on offer in the Leia Loft store. The game runs at a choppy frame rate, which is bad enough, but the 3D effect is so strong it's dizzying, making the experience tough to enjoy for more than a minute or two.It's these moments when you'll be happy to know that the Hydrogen One offers a serviceable QHD display when you'd rather not fuss with 3D. It's quite an accurate one, too, with a Delta-E rating of 0.28 that's virtually equal with the iPhone XS Max's 0.23 result. (Numbers closer to 0 indicate truer-to-life colors.)Red's 5.7-inch panel covers 141.2 percent of the sRGB color space, which isn't too shabby for LCD — though at 411 nits, it falls about 200 nits short of the peak full-screen brightness of the OLED-powered iPhone XS Max.However, there's a caveat to be wary of here. While Red is adamant that the Hydrogen One's display concedes nothing to the competition in 2D mode, there's a degree of graininess during up-close viewing that simply can't be unseen after you've noticed it — a fine grid that is likely a byproduct of the substrate when it's not in use. Although I wouldn't call it a deal breaker — it's borderline invisible at the typical distance you'd hold your phone — it is something unique to Red's device, and arguably keeps you from getting the best of both worlds regarding 3D and 2D content.The Hydrogen One's dual 12.3-megapixel shooters may come from the company that revolutionized cinema cameras, but Red makes it clear: The phone's built-in photography stack uses a mobile image sensor and mobile components. If you want to capture content that wouldn't embarrass Hollywood filmmakers, you'll have to spring for the Hydrogen One's cinema mod, which snaps onto the phone’s back using those pogo pins and accepts all popular brands of full-size lenses.That mod will arrive next year for a price that's still undisclosed. In the meantime, though, the Hydrogen One has a pretty special camera of its own, in that it can capture either 3D images in the aforementioned 4-view format or regular-old 2D files. It can also capture shallow depth-of-field portraits, though the second lens doesn't have a narrower view angle for optical zoom.Unfortunately, the nature of the Hydrogen One's special display tech means that sharing a 4-view image in this review simply wouldn't get across the 3D factor. Red has a kind-of micro-Instagram for that, called Holopics, where Hydrogen One users can distribute their own 4-view photos or browse those taken by others. It works quite well, and the network is already populated with stunning pictures taken by Red's Houdini group of early adopters. I should caution that during my testing, Holopics included a bit of salacious material that Red evidently scrambled to remove from the feed: you — and your eyes — have been warned.Four-view images look about as good as the video clips on the Hydrogen Network. Staging is critical when you take these photos, though, and if you want the 3D effect to really come across in a pronounced way, it helps to take close-up or macro images with a progression of objects extending into the background.We can show you the cameras' 2D output. And it's actually not too shabby, as evidenced by this photo outside the New York Public Library. While Google's Pixel 3 casts deeper shadows and more saturated colors, it paints the sky in an unrealistically vibrant shade of blue, and dials in a bit too much warmth with respect to the library's brick exterior. The Hydrogen One's rendition may look a little drearier by comparison, though it is more appropriate for the actual conditions.Inside the Main Concourse of Grand Central Station, the Hydrogen One again delivered a more neutral shot that wasn't as saturated as the Pixel 3's, though it also blew out the highlights and failed to convey the same sharpness in the details — especially surrounding the Metro North timetable text below the iconic clock.Things really fell apart for the Hydrogen One when I attempted to snap a portrait of my colleague Caitlin under the harsh lighting of the terminal. In fairness, this would be a challenging proposition for any phone camera, but the Pixel 3 easily wins here with superior color and bokeh, more pronounced shadows, greater accuracy of Caitlin's skin tone and far less blurriness overall. The difference is simply night and day.The Hydrogen One's 8.3-MP front-facing cameras captures better selfies than that sorry portrait above, though again, the Pixel 3 has the advantage in  detail and reining in those highlights and shadows. Red's lenses totally miss the texture of my shirt, for example, and muddy up the color and texture of my hair. It's yet more proof that while the Hydrogen One's shooters can be quite good in the right conditions, they lack the versatility you get from the best smartphone cameras that are built to perform in all kinds of scenarios — from moody, dimly lit scenes to dramatic portraits.Red lavished the same attention on the Hydrogen One's audio architecture as it has on the holographic display, and the results are similarly mixed. The company has made equally lofty claims with regard to its H3O algorithm — a system that lends spatial quality to traditional stereo audio.To get the full brunt of what H3O can do, you'll need a pair of headphones — though it doesn't have to be an expensive one. I snagged the Pixel 3's USB-C earbuds, and everything from Spotify tunes to movie trailers sounded richer, wider and clearer through the Hydrogen One compared with Google's flagship.Again, much like with the screen, don't expect a revelatory experience here. But H3O does supply a noticeable boost to audio, akin to what you get from any other smartphone with a high-quality digital-to-analog converter, such as LG's V series.However, that advantage vanishes when you ditch the buds for the Hydrogen One's stereo speakers. Given the amount of real estate they consume, you'd expect them to be loud at the very least. Yet, the sound they produce is inexplicably compressed and not especially powerful.I fired up an old favorite: Cibo Matto's ""Le Pain Perdu"" — a great test of a song, as it balances booming bass with warm, airy drums and funky, potent horns. Our current gold standard for mobile audio, the Razer Phone 2, navigated the eclectic soundscape with care, allowing each instrument room to breathe. The Hydrogen One failed to hit the same volume, and the audio was so muffled I had to do a double-take to make sure the phone wasn't lying speaker-side down.While the Hydrogen One's display may be from the future, its internals certainly aren't. This phone was originally supposed to arrive in the first quarter of 2018, but after a series of lengthy delays, Red wasn't able to update the original Snapdragon 835 processor to the newer 845 that debuted in the spring.This puts the Hydrogen One at a disadvantage compared with the latest Android flagships, not to mention the A12 Bionic powered iPhone XR, XS and XS Max. On Geekbench 4, a test that measures overall system performance, Red's device turned in a multicore score of 6,211 — nearly 3,000 points behind the OnePlus 6 with 8GB of RAM, and more than 5,000 points behind the class-leading iPhone XS Max.3DMark's Sling Shot Unlimited graphics test didn't yield quite as lopsided results, though they still didn't fall in Red's favor. The Hydrogen One finished with a score of 2,760, while the XS Max ended with 4,339.  MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowIn our real-world video encoding test, where we time how long it takes to transcode a short 4K file into 1080p using Adobe's Premiere Clip app, the Hydrogen One wrapped up the process in 4 minutes and 25 seconds. That's nearly a minute longer than the OnePlus 6 (3:45) and more than 2 minutes longer than the Samsung Galaxy S9 (2:32). Both of those handsets have the newer 845 CPU.The Hydrogen One didn't handle PUBG Mobile quite as cleanly as those phones on the game's maxed-out HDR graphics setting. There were occasionally hiccups and dropped frames, especially when quickly changing direction or weaving to avoid enemy fire. Fortunately, though, things at least ran smoothly enough most of the time for me to nab two kills (with a pistol, no less) before meeting my untimely end.Packed to the limit with a 4,500-mAh battery, the Hydrogen One ranks among the longest-lasting phones we've tested all year. The bulky handset ran for 13 hours and 9 minutes of continuous website streaming over T-Mobile's LTE network before running out of juice.Not even the iPhone XS Max or Galaxy Note 9 delivered that kind of longevity, shutting down after 10:38 and 11:26, respectively.While it's encouraging that you won't need to charge the Hydrogen One as often as some other phones, a lack of support for wireless charging makes it a little less convenient when you do have to top up.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThen again, most other phones aren't clad in Kevlar and aluminum (or titanium) — so that's a trade-off some might be willing to entertain.Underneath that intimidating exterior, the Hydrogen One actually runs a fairly stock version of Android 8.1 Oreo, with light customization pertaining to the launcher, camera interface and a sprinkling of bloatware.Some of the added software is welcome, like the Hydrogen Network, Leia Loft and Red Player. These are the only ways you can access 4-view content on the device, so disabling them would defeat the  purpose of owning the phone. In fact, 4-view photos and videos are visible only through the Red Player, and not Google Photos. That behavior is especially odd, considering the camera app defaults to Google Photos when you scroll back to view your last-taken shot — but only if your last-taken shot was a 2D one.Aside from Red's software, our AT&T-tied phone came preloaded with a suite of the carrier's apps. We could have done without the DirecTV app, though, thankfully, everything you don't want can easily be disabled, and unlocked models surely won't include any of that. Additionally, if you're put off by the rather garish black-and-silver industrial theme that the phone boots with, you can opt for a more classic Android look and feel through the launcher's settings.Red tells us the Hydrogen One will receive an update to Android 9 Pie in the near future, though it hasn’t shared any specifics to date.Rarely have I been so conflicted by a device as I have with Red's very first smartphone. The Hydrogen One is an ambitious device that so desperately wants to change your life. And every now and then, when the display strikes your eyes at just the precise angle, you feel fleeting glimmers of the magic.However, Red is working with technology that simply hasn't been  perfected yet. Truly immersive glasses-free 3D with zero concessions for comfort and quality is still something of a pipe dream. And, judging from the number of my co-workers who have played with the device over the past week, there's no guarantee that Red's particular brand of 3D will be satisfying or stress-free for your eyes.If you're intrigued by what the Hydrogen One promises, the best course of action is to visit an AT&T or Verizon store and see the phone running 4-view content in person. Even then, you're faced with an important question: Does the excitement of 3D justify all of the Hydrogen One's myriad quirks, spec deficiencies and high price? Right now, I'm not convinced it does.Credit: Tom's Guide"
165,Razer Phone 2,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/razer-phone-2,review-5866.html","Editors’ Note: Shortly before publication, Razer released a software update that’s designed to improve camera quality, audio performance and display tuning. We will update this review once we’ve evaluated this update. When Razer debuted the original Razer Phone, the gaming specialist focused on creating a phone for mobile gamers, largely succeeding. Razer's original phone was the first to feature a smartphone display with a 120-Hertz refresh rate and audio that sounded better than that from most laptops. True, there were some bugs to work out, but it was an admirable first effort.Razer's back with the second-gen version of its phone, which is flashier, prettier and more durable than the original. Priced at $799, the Razer Phone 2 keeps the audio and that incredible refresh rate of its predecessor, but it also seeks to improve on the things that kept that phone from the top of heap, and those efforts meet with varying degrees of success. Unfortunately, lackluster cameras and a display dimmer than the competition's are stones around the neck of an otherwise-solid smartphone.When I hear the words ""gaming phone,"" visions of aggressive, outlandish design created from discarded parts of an errant gaming laptop or desktop enter my mind's eye. The second iteration of the Razer Phone is none of those things. Instead, it's a master class in sophisticated elegance, much like its predecessor, but with a few notable changes.For starters, the rear panel is made of shiny Corning Gorilla Glass 5. It's striking, but nowhere near as striking as the new logo. Going full-on gamer, Razer's three-headed-snake emblem now glows with the enticing glimmer of Chroma lighting. And just like on any Razer product worth its salt, the color and effects can be controlled via Razer's preloaded software. Once you've had your fill of gazing at all the pretty colors, hazard a gander at  the logo and check out the pair of 12-megapixel cameras sandwiching the LED flash as they gently jut outward.If you're not a fan of the high-gloss look, don't worry; you can also get the new phone with a satin finish on the rear panel, something we've yet to see on a smartphone. That version adds another $100 to the price, though.Both the sides of the Razer Phone 2 and the front-mounted speaker grilles are constructed from the black CNC aluminum I've come to know and love from Razer. You'll find a microSD/SIM card slot on the top left corner, above the two raised, circular volume buttons. There's an elongated, slightly recessed oval on the right for the power button. A lone USB Type-C port sits at the bottom, meaning you're going to need a dongle or a pair of wireless headphones.At the front of the Razer Phone 2 are two speakers, one at the top and one at the bottom of the 5.72-inch screen. An 8-MP shooter is nestled in the top left of the top speaker, along with a flash.MORE: The Best Phones for GamingAll that glass and aluminum make the Razer Phone 2 (6.2 x 3.1 x 0.3 inches) a heavyweight, at 7.8 ounces. The iPhone XS Max (6.2 x 3.1 x 0.3 inches) and Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (6.3 x 3 x 0.34 inches) are a tad lighter, at 7.3 and 7.1 ounces. The Google Pixel 3 XL (6.2 x 3.0 x 0.3 inches) is the lightest, at 6.9 ounces.Despite all the glass on the Razer Phone 2, it's a surprisingly durable phone. Both the front and back panels consist of Corning Gorilla Glass 5, while the actual frame is aluminum.In an unexpected twist, the phone has an IP67 rating, meaning it can stand to be submerged in up to 5 feet of water for half an hour, despite all those holes in the speaker grille. That doesn't mean that you can start gaming underwater, but you can breathe a sigh of relief when your expensive piece of tech takes that inevitable dive into the toilet.Thanks to its resplendent Chroma lighting, Razer could have settled for making a phone with the prettiest light show. I mean, it's easy to get caught up in finding that perfect shade out of the 16.8 million hues available for the logo to flash in the preinstalled Chroma app. I took the easy way out and chose Spectrum, so the emblem could paint with all the colors of the wind. In addition to the color(s), you can also select the LED brightness and one of three effects. (Static, which is one constant color; the pulsating Breathing effect; and Spectrum, which cycles through every color.)But aside from all that captivating color, the best thing about the Chroma app is that you can set the lighting to glow in different colors based on your notifications. Colors are tied to the logo of apps, so your phone's logo glows blue when a Microsoft Outlook message arrives, red for Google Chrome, purple for Microsoft Teams and so on.Aware that all this flash could negatively affect the battery, Razer added battery-consumption settings. On High, the Chroma effects will flash until you turn the phone off or change modes. Medium tones it down a bit, using Chroma only when the screen is on and for notifications. With the lowest setting activated, you'll see the lighting only if you have Notifications toggled on.The more things change, the more they stay the same. Razer kept the 2560 x 1440, 120-Hertz UltraMotion LCD IGZO display from the original Razer Phone. This is the same display that earned Netflix certification.Last year, the panel impressed with its buttery-smooth graphic-rendering capabilities, while this time around, it's just a smidge bigger, at 5.72-inches. Just like Nvidia's G-Sync technology, UltraMotion syncs up the display's refresh rate to the GPU, giving you those lovely graphics. However, those tear-free images come at a cost. When it comes to colors and brightness, the LCD panel on the Razer Phone 2 simply can't hold a candle to Super AMOLED displays on phones like the Note 9 .I watched the If Beale Street Could Talk trailer with a few of my colleagues, and we were astounded at how dim and dull the Razer Phone 2 looked next to the Note 9. The light blue shower tiles looked dingy on the Razer Phone's screen, as did the marigold curtain as we watched two adorable kids splash in their bubble bath. It wasn't so bad when were looking at the phones dead on, but the minute we moved from the sweet spot, color on the Razer Phone 2 washed out, signaling rather narrow viewing angles. At least, details were sharp enough that I could see individual bubbles in the suds on one of the children's heads.Although not as vibrant as on the competition, the colors on the Razer Phone 2 as I played Real Racing 3 were fairly rich. I could see the sun glinting off my neon-green Ford Focus as I jockeyed for position on the track.When we measured the Razer Phone 2's color-reproduction capabilities, we found that the panel could reproduce 104 percent of the sRGB gamut. That's good, but the iPhone XS Max did better, with 123 percent. The Note 9 more than doubled the Razer's score, at 224 percent.With this phone's color-accuracy score of 1.2 on Delta-E (0 is ideal), it was easy to see why the colors on the Razer Phone 2 seemed so dull. The Note 9 and XS Max were much more accurate, with scores of 0.3 and 0.2, respectively.MORE: Razer Phone 2 Hands-On: A Better Gaming Phone, But Should You ...Razer also struck out on the brightness test, averaging 492 nits, which is much dimmer than the results from the XS (606 nits), Max and Note 9 (604 nits), though it's above the average brightness for smartphones (488 nits).Once again, Razer rules the roost as the king of smartphone audio. The front-firing speakers pack a serious wallop, easily filling our test lab with loud, clean sound. Using a combination of Dolby Atmos software and Razer's proprietary algorithms, the phone delivered a warm, relatively balanced reproduction of Rihanna's ""Work."" However, like with most smartphones, the bass continues to be a key missing element.That didn't stop the phone from delivering some rather realistic car audio as I tore down the track in Real Racing 3. And when I blew up an explosive barrel in Shadowgun Legends, the sound had discernable depth.MORE: Best Gaming Headsets - Picks for PCs, PS4, Xbox and ...Although the Dolby Atmos software gives you four options to choose from (Dynamic, Movies, Music and Custom), my default quickly became Music even when gaming, as it gave the fullest performance with the most clarity.When I talked to Razer about its latest phone, the company vowed major improvements to the lackluster camera from the OG Razer Phone. The biggest change involves adding Sony IMX sensors to the Razer Phone 2. While both rear lenses on the new phone are 12 megapixels, one is a wide-angle lens and offers optical image stabilization, while the other is a telephoto lens with a 2x zoom.Another notable change relates to the actual camera software; there are actually some bells and whistles — not many but some, like a Beauty and Portrait mode. However, the app still lacks a Pro mode, so anyone looking to adjust white balance or ISO is out of luck.Alas, the more things change, the more they stay the same. I took several test shots with the Razer Phone 2 and the Note 9, and it's clear that Razer has a lot more work to do in the camera department.MORE: Camera Face-Off: Can an iPhone Beat a DSLR?A shot taken in our video studio yielded muted color, making Cappy (a key character in Super Mario Odyssey) look dull and drab. Compare that to the Note 9, which portrayed Cappy in a beautiful cherry red. The devil, and Razer, showed up in the details, providing more definition in the brick face background.The Razer Phone had a better showing when I ventured outside, serving a fair amount of detail, particularly in the delicate veins of the pink petals in a flower. However, the edges of the picture were rather fuzzy, which was disappointing. The image taken by the Note 9 was a bit dark but still had the more-vibrant color.One place the original Razer Phone cameras struggled was capturing shots in low light, and I'm happy to report some improvement with the Razer Phone 2. It captured the shot almost instantaneously, instead of making me wait 2 to 3 seconds. And the new Razer Phone definitely grabs more detail than its predecessor did. However, it took only one zoom in to reveal a host of digital noise in the Razer Phone's shot, and my subject's beard look like the metal shavings in one of those old-school magnetic-beard toys. The Note 9's pic had much better skin tone and detail.The Razer's 8-MP front camera is passable but needs improvement. It washed out my skin tone, giving me an ashy appearance. The window in the background was also blown out, which only made the rest of the picture look worse.Armed with a 2.8-GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage, the Razer Phone 2 is not here to play. (Well, it is, but just not like that.) The 845 is the most powerful Snapdragon CPU on the market, and its presence here only solidifies Razer's intent to deliver a kick-ass gaming experience in the company's flagship. Navigating between homepages and apps was quick and seamless, even after I opened 20 tabs in Google Chrome and launched several games.The phone held its own against most of the competition during our synthetic testing, scoring 8,903 on Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance. That score beat the showing by the Pixel 3 XL (7,684), which has its own 845 CPU, but the Razer couldn't top the XS Max and its A12 Bionic CPU, which shattered the curve, at 11,515.It took the new Razer Phone 3 minutes and 59 seconds to transcode a 4K video clip to 1080. This is a passable time, but nowhere near as fast as the times of 2:42 and 0:39 from the Pixel 3 XL and XS Max, respectively.And while multitasking and switching between apps quickly is important on a smartphone, the Razer Phone isn't just a smartphone. It's also a gaming phone, so it had better deliver on its biggest claim. Thankfully, the phone's Adreno 630 GPU lived up to the hype, scoring 4,621 on the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme 3.1 benchmark. That mark easily passed the respective 4,396 and 4,339 scores put up by the Pixel 3 XL and the XS Max. However, the Note 9 had a slightly better score of 4,639.In case you need more than 64GB for storage, you can expand the Razer Phone 2's capacity via the microSD slot which supports up to 2TB.Gaming on the Razer Phone 2 is just as fun as it was on Razer's original. The UltraMotion tech and the high refresh rate meant that when I ran into a swarm of hostile aliens in Shadowgun Legends, there was never any slowdown. Instead, I blasted my way through the horde with relative ease, as guts and empty casings flew everywhere. The powerful, front-firing speakers bombarded my ears with big explosions, gritty battle and death cries, and the staccato beat of persistent gunfire.While I'm a huge fan of the Chroma app, when it's time to game, I'm all about Cortex. This handy app from Razer acts as a game aggregator, optimizer and recommendation resource.Once launched, Cortex is broken down into three segments. The Featured section shows you all the games that are optimized to run with the Razer Phone's gaming-centric specs. Library displays all the games currently installed on the device. You also have the option to go through your app library in case Cortex missed something or if you'd like to disable access.MORE: Nintendo Switch vs. PS4 vs. Xbox One: Which Console Should You Get?Then there's Game Booster, where the magic happens. Not only can you toggle the overall app based on power-conservation settings (Custom, Power Saver and Performance), but you can also enable the Do Not Disturb feature, so you can play without the distraction of pesky notifications. You also have the ability to edit Booster configurations for every game in your library via slider. Starting from More Battery and ending at Higher Performance, the CPU clock speed, resolution and display refresh rate adjust accordingly, so you can get the best out of your gaming experience whether you're playing on a full battery or with a quarter left in the tank.We're still working to get our Tom's Guide Battery Test running on the Razer Phone 2, in which we have the phone surf the web continuously over T-Mobile's LTE network until the device runs out of juice. Please stay tuned for updated results.I had a week to live, work and play with the Razer Phone 2, and over that time, I managed to squeeze about 6 hours of mixed usage on average per day out of the phone's 4,000-mAH battery. That means that in the moments I wasn't fighting dinosaurs in Ark: Survival Evolved or repelling hostile forces in Shadowgun Legends or Vainglory, I was taking advantage of the Netflix-certified display and the THX-certified audio by watching Big Mouth and The Dragon Prince on Netflix.When gaming, I set the Game Booster to Higher Performance, which pushed the CPU clock speed to 2.8 GHz and the panel refresh rate to 120 Hz. For everything else, I used the Optimal setting, which dropped the speed to 2.32 GHz and the refresh rate to 90 Hz. I spent 2 hours gaming per day and about an hour watching Netflix; I spent the rest of the time checking social media and reading news. I never got the phone to last a full workday; the closest I got was 7 hours and 15 minutes when I cut down on the gaming.Waiting for your phone to charge can be a drag, especially when you're anxious to get to the next level of your game. To alleviate this burden, the Razer Phone 2 has Qualcomm's QuickCharge4+ technology, which the company claims can restore a 50 percent charge in only 15 minutes.Unlike the previous model, the Razer Phone 2 supports wireless charging, which Razer made sure to play up with its new $99 wireless charger. Decked out with Chroma lighting, this charger gives you a light show, even when your phone is out of commission.Just because I own a Samsung phone, that doesn't mean I can't appreciate vanilla Android. Running on stock Android 8.1 (Oreo), the Razer Phone 2's user interface is clean, minimal and easy to navigate. Also, unfettered by the likes of TouchWiz or any other underlying skin, app navigation and phone operation overall seem much more fluid.I'm a fan of the long-press app shortcuts and notifications dots on Razer’s phones, which make everything faster and more convenient. Razer did make a few minor aesthetic alterations to the OS, such as changing the text color in the notifications from white to Razer's emerald green.While Razer's new wireless charger is nice, it doesn't do much to enhance the mobile gaming experience. But the company does have a few peripherals that do, such as the $149.99 Raiju Mobile controller, which features an adjustable phone mount, mappable multifunction buttons and a hair-trigger mode.You can also buy the $99 Razer Hammerhead USB-C ANC headphones, a pair of in-ear buds that offer a built-in digital-to-audio converter, active noise cancellation, in-line controls and an integrated microphone.Although Razer is offering two versions of the Razer Phone 2, the only difference is the look. The glossy mirror finish costs $799, while the satin finish is $899. Both phones will still have the same internals: a 2.8-GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor with 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and an Adreno 630 GPU.I like the idea of Razer Phone 2 becoming a true flagship phone that happens to excel at gaming, but I'm still on the fence about the concept of gaming phones — at least in the United States. Mobile gaming has a major following in Asia, thanks to games like Arena of Valor, while most U.S. Android gamers are waiting for access to Fortnite.Razer's second bite at the apple offers a flashier, yet still-elegant aesthetic that's balls-to-the-walls Razer, with good performance and that best-in-class audio. And at a starting price of $799, the Razer Phone 2 is rather inexpensive in an era when $1,000 phones are becoming the norm. That 120-Hz display really does make games look better than on your average smartphone, too.However, Razer still has a ways to go before its phone can be considered a flagship device. While there were some improvements on the Razer Phone 2's camera, it's not enough to compete with heavy hitters like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9.Speaking of Samsung, while I understand why it's important for Razer to have the 120-Hz LCD display, the company has to find a way to compete with AMOLED panels. Overall, the Razer Phone 2 is a good choice for gamers and multimedia lovers who want the best audio and graphics rendering, but Razer still has some more retooling to do if its phone is going to break out of its gaming niche.Credit: Tom's Guide"
166,Sony Xperia XZ3,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-xperia-xz3,review-5827.html","No your eyes do not deceive you. This is a review for Sony's new new flagship smartphone, the Xperia XZ3. It arrives no more than five months since the Xperia XZ2 hit the shelves, and three months after the XZ2 Premium.Given the short turnaround between devices, it comes as little surprise that the XZ3 is a very familiar smartphone, right down to what's underneath its metal-and-glass enclosure. With a new OLED display and slightly increased battery capacity, though,the XZ3 seems like the device the XZ2 should have been in some ways.However, those improvements demand a higher price. The $899 Xperia XZ3 is $100 more expensive than its predecessor, while still asking owners to make compromises that rival phones don't. Sony could have righted those wrongs; instead, it delivered yet another flagship that fails to meet the standard set by the best Android handsets on the market today.The $899 Xperia XZ3 is available for preorder now through Amazon and begins shipping Oct. 17. The phone comes in three colors — Black, White Silver and Forest Green — in just a single configuration with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It's compatible exclusively with GSM carriers, including T-Mobile, AT&T, Metro by T-Mobile and Cricket Wireless. Verizon and Sprint customers won't be able to use it on their carriers' networks.Amazon is  offering the XZ3 with a free pair of Sony's Xperia Ear Duo Bluetooth earbuds, which normally cost $279. The Ear Duo is rather unconventional among wireless headsets, as it's designed to invite ambient noise into the listening experience, rather than cutting it out. It also relays news, notifications, weather and calendar appointments to you via voice, Google Assistant-style. Sony made a long-awaited change to its smartphones' design with the Xperia XZ2 earlier this year. It was certainly a move in the right direction: The XZ2 introduced more rounded edges and an 18:9 aspect ratio coupled with thinner bezels compared with generations of blocky Sony flagships.The new approach was a welcome one, but the XZ2 was still far from perfect. It was thick, tall and bulky, with a fingerprint sensor that sat awkwardly low on the back of the device and a super-slippery finish that made it prone to sliding off surfaces. These concerns remain with the Xperia XZ3.At 6.8 ounces, the XZ3 isn't quite as heavy as the 7.1-ounce iPhone 8 Plus, but it's close. Actually, the XZ3 is ever so slightly taller and thicker than the handset it's replacing, yet the bezels haven't been trimmed any further.Sony's hallmarks, like stereo front-facing speakers and a dedicated two-step camera button, return on the XZ3. But in other respects, this device looks rather generic — especially if you opt for the uninspired black model. The Forest Green and non-U.S. Bordeaux Red model are much more distinctive.Yet the XZ3's poor ergonomics far outweigh any aesthetic concerns. Even once you get past the odd placement of the fingerprint sensor, you still have to contend with Side Sense — a new feature Sony has introduced to the XZ3 that should make life easier, but instead very quickly becomes a nuisance.Side Sense is sort of similar to Google's Active Edge tech in the Pixel 2, except rather than squeezing the phone for shortcuts, you double-tap the edge instead. The problem with this in relation to the fingerprint sensor is that it's much harder to double-tap the side of the device with your thumb when your index finger is where it has to be to unlock the phone. It forced me to adopt an awkward grip — let's call it Xperia Claw — whereupon I primarily balanced the phone with my middle and ring fingers, while my pinky provided support from the bottom edge just to stabilize the whole mess.The funny thing about Side Sense is that it's tremendously easy to trigger, but never when you want to. Unlike the Pixel 2, it's not  the frame that's sensitive to pressure — it's the bit of glass right above it. But even when you're aware of this, directly pressing the that space doesn't always call up shortcuts.MORE: Best Phablet: Top Big Screen Phones (6 Inches or Larger)Ironically, though, I accidentally summoned Side Sense all the time when I was just holding the phone in my hand normally. In that way, the XZ3 seems to operate with the polar opposite of palm rejection. Maybe it'd be avoidable if you could restrict Side Sense to certain portions of the edge — like, say, the region between the volume and power buttons. However, Sony offers very few customization options. You can set Side Sense to operate on one or both sides, but you can only increase the sensitivity — not lower it.It's these issues that make Side Sense feel like a bad joke at your expense. It pops up most often when you least want it to, requires you to hold the device in an odd fashion, and there's absolutely nothing you can do to fix the feature — short of turning it off, of course.After years of trotting out LCD phones while its competitors moved onto newer and better display technology, Sony has finally released a flagship Xperia handset with an OLED screen.The XZ3 sports a 6-inch curved OLED panel with a resolution of 2880 x 1440. Although it doesn't pack quite as many pixels as the XZ2 Premium’s 4K LCD display, the XZ3's screen does get brighter, peaking at 520 nits under our light meter, compared with the 442 that the XZ2 Premium offered. The iPhone XS Max's 611-nit Super Retina Display still outpaces both, though the XZ3 is at least above the 466-nit smartphone average.That’s all well and good, but the real reason you want the XZ3’s display is for the vividity of its colors. Watching the trailer for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse on Sony's handset, I was struck by the intensity of the candy-colored digital billboards lining Times Square as the famous web-slinger swept past. The XZ3 painted the neon hues with a bit less warmth than Samsung's Galaxy Note 9, though the XZ3 delivered a crisper image overall.Peering closely into the XZ3's screen, you can see a slight  paper-texture effect that marks certain OLED panels, like those in the LG V40 and Pixel 2 XL. The Galaxy Note 9 and iPhone XS smooth over these artifacts, but do so in a way that makes on-screen content look a bit softer than what you'd see on Sony's flagship. In other words, the XZ3 concedes some extra noise in the pursuit of increased clarity, though the end result still looks great.MORE: QLED vs OLED TV: Who Wins?Regarding color accuracy, Sony's smartphone struggles a bit compared with  the competition. The XZ3's 0.53 Delta-E score in the phone's Standard Mode is moderately high compared with the iPhone XS' 0.26 rating, indicating less realistic hues. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) However, the XZ3 display's ability to cover 219.7 percent of the sRGB color space is about on a par with the Note 9's 224 percent. Xperia owners who prefer either more muted or saturated colors canswitch between alternate profiles to customize their viewing experience.There's just one camera on the back of the Xperia XZ3: a 19-megapixel, f/2.0 lens armed with Sony's Exmor RS sensor and Bionz image-processing tech. On the front, you'll find a 13-MP lens with an every-so-slightly larger f/1.9 aperture.These days, it's a bit strange returning to a single-lens main camera in a flagship smartphone. That's not necessarily an indictment of the XZ3's shooter — the Pixel 2 also employs one sensor and remains our favorite camera phone to date. However, Sony hasn't been able to give the XZ3's rear camera a Portrait mode, which some aspiring mobile photogs may find disappointing.As a result, the above portrait of my colleague Caitlin just didn't pop with the same kind of drama you'll see in the Note 9's rendition, which also benefited from the zoomed-in perspective from that device's telephoto lens. With the XZ3, I had to get the phone really close to Caitlin's face to achieve a similar shot, and even then the final product had an unflattering fisheye effect to it.The Sony and Samsung devices adopted very different strategies in capturing the flower you see above. The Note 9 picked up all the little glimmers of light within the petals that the XZ3 missed, while the XZ3 brightened up everything  and boosted the yellows and reds for a much more striking initial impression. I prefer the Xperia's attempt for its liveliness, but this is one of those examples where each phone excels in different areas.The Note 9 offers one of the best low-light cameras you'll find in any smartphone, and it demonstrates why here. Sure, the XZ3's attempt is better exposed in certain areas, but the Note 9 delivers so much more clarity across the board that’s it's really no competition. The Xperia's shot is tinged with noise and a smeariness that makes everything look out of focus.Although the XZ3 can't pull off shallow depth-of-field portraits with its rear camera, it can do bokeh through the front lens. Unfortunately, after seeing the results, I'm not sure Sony should have bothered. The Xperia is unable to differentiate between the foreground and the background, resulting in artifacts around my shoulders, hat and hair where a portion of my surroundings remain sharp when they should be blurred. The details within my face are mostly fine, though my skin tone is a tinge too red.Overall, the XZ3's images overall tend to be  hit-or-miss, but I do have to give Sony props for simplifying its camera app. What used to be a complicated barrage of sliders and not terribly descriptive icons has been replaced with more intuitive organization. The new design more closely resembles the interface other phone makers have adopted. I also appreciated the new Smart Launch feature, which automatically launches the camera when you lift up the phone in landscape mode.The Xperia XZ3 is powered by the same Snapdragon 845 chipset found in the XZ2. And because the XZ3 features an identical 4GB of RAM as well, the user experience is pretty much the same between Sony's newest handset and its predecessor.The XZ3 tallied a multicore score of 8,253 in Geekbench 4, a benchmark that measures overall performance. That's slightly below the XZ2's 8,449, though the difference is so minimal that it doesn't translate to a noticeable drop in performance.Still, other premium Android offerings, like the OnePlus 6, the Galaxy Note 9 and even Asus' $499 ZenFone 5Z, hover around the 9,000 threshold, thanks to their extra RAM — which help out when you switch between apps or run multiple tasks at the same time.Nevertheless, the XZ3 handled PUBG Mobile at its high frame rate and HDR graphics settings. While there were a few errant lost frames here and there, the experience was still consistent enough for me to pick off four enemies and gather a ton of loot. Surprisingly, though, the XZ3 managed just 3,304 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme graphics test — some 1,000 points less than the LG G7 and 1,300 points behind the Galaxy S9+.MORE: 5 Ways the Note 9 Beats the iPhone Xs MaxIndustry benchmarks aside, the XZ3 performed adequately in our real-world video encoding test, where we convert a 2-minute, 4K video file into 1080p through the Adobe Premiere Clip app. The XZ3 accomplished this in 3 minutes and 35 seconds — 12 seconds faster than the OnePlus 6, but 40 seconds slower than the Pixel 2 XL, which still uses the last-gen Snapdragon 835 chip.  Sony has increased the size of the Xperia XZ3's battery to 3,330 mAh, up from 3,180 mAh in the XZ2. Because the phone runs much of the same hardware, we expected a similar showing in our battery test, where the XZ2 lasted for an impressive 11 hours and 47 minutes.Unfortunately, the XZ3 gave up the ghost after just 7 hours and 41 minutes of streaming websites over T-Mobile LTE. That’s hardly an impressive number compared to the 9:48 average among smartphones, so we ran it again. The second time around, Sony’s flagship managed 8 hours and 4 minutes — a bit better, but still far from ideal.Thankfully, out in the real world, the XZ3 fared much better, lasting about a day-and-a-half with moderate usage. On one particular day, I unplugged the device at 7:40 PM and didn’t plug it back in again until it dropped to about 20 percent at midnight the next evening. Two full days or more would seem to be a stretch, but thankfully the poor result from the web streaming test proved an aberration in this instance.Once again, the latest Xperia boasts Sony's Battery Care technology, designed to limit the amount of time the phone is kept fully charged to reduce stress on the battery, extending its overall life. The XZ3 accomplishes this by monitoring your daily charging habits, then predicting when you'll remove the phone from the charger. The device also supports Qi induction for wireless charging.MORE: iPhone XS Drop Test: Watch It Survive an 11-Foot Drop On ConcreteUnfortunately, if you use the adapter and the USB Type-C cable that comes with your XZ3, you'll find the device won't top up very quickly. The XZ3  made it to only 28 percent capacity over 30 minutes when connected to the stock gear. Charging the device with a third-party 65-watt charger didn't speed things up, either. It's disappointing to see such slow charging speeds in such an expensive phone, given that many handsets, including the $529 OnePlus 6, can hit 60 percent in the same amount of time the XZ3 takes to reach half that.Credit to Sony for launching the Xperia XZ3 with Android 9 Pie — the latest version of Google's mobile OS. The update won't arrive for the XZ2 series until November, but XZ3 owners get it right out of the box.With Pie comes a few interface changes  to messaging notifications, refinements to Autofill and accelerated machine learning. However, Google's suite of Digital Wellbeing features aren't included in at least this initial release, nor is the OS' new gesture-based navigation system. For now, some of these remain Pixel-only features, and those who do pick up an XZ3 might feel left in the lurch even though their phone technically runs Android 9.Aside from those omissions, Sony's interpretation of Android remains one of the cleaner and lighter installations you'll find. The company now allows you to choose which of its custom apps and partner services you'd like to install on your phone when you set it up, which is a nice way to avoid some unwanted bloatware, like Sony's Movie Creator app. However, Xperia devices still rely on Swiftkey as their default keyboard app, which wouldn't be a big deal if it was scaled properly on the XZ3's big display. The keys end up being far too small to reliably hit, which made Gboard one of the first apps I installed on our review unit.Finally, no discussion of a flagship Xperia would be complete without recognizing the eternally confounding Dynamic Vibration feature. Dynamic Vibration partners an oversize haptic motor with proprietary software that vibrates the phone to match the intensity of the sound playing.As far as I can tell, Dynamic Vibration hasn't seen any improvement on the XZ3. While the motor is powerful, it's remarkably imprecise; don't expect any of that nuanced, highly specialized tactile feedback that makes devices like the iPhone XS, the Pixel 2 and the Galaxy S9  so satisfying to use. It's still hilariously poorly suited for music, and a really bad idea to accidentally leave on when the phone is sitting flat on a surface — lest you want your $900 smartphone to march itself off a desk and into a million little pieces, lemmings-style.MORE: LG V40 ThinQ vs. Galaxy Note 9: It's Not Even CloseDynamic Vibration still isn't compatible with many games, including PUBG Mobile. Worse yet, when it does work, the pulses never feel  synced to the content on screen. The latest Venom trailer simply sent a low hum through the phone's body from start to finish. The motor was so hyperactive that it didn't feel like it was accentuating key moments — rather, it made me feel like a fool for cradling a phone that wouldn't stop buzzing for 3 minutes straight.In the grand scheme of things, the Sony Xperia XZ3 is a serviceable premium smartphone with a gorgeous OLED display, top-tier hardware and build quality and the latest version of Android onboard. But serviceable isn't good enough when you're spending just shy of a grand.Consider all the handsets you could buy that cost around the same price of the XZ3. There's the iPhone XS at $999, which offers a much better camera, brighter screen and faster performance. Those who prefer Android could spring for the $849 Galaxy S9+, which offers both of those aforementioned benefits as well as a better design, greater battery life and even a headphone jack. The Note 9 unleashes a barrage of special productivity features with its S Pen, while the OnePlus 6 outperforms the XZ3 with up to twice the RAM, yet costs nearly $400 less.There are simply too many good options out there to settle for the XZ3, and even more on the way. The Pixel 3 will be here soon, and OnePlus will  have a follow-up to the OnePlus 6 as well. You could make an argument for the previous Xperia XZ2 at $799, but all Sony has really done with the XZ3 is thrown in a nicer display and jacked up the price. For consumers, the math just doesn't add up.Credit: Tom's Guide"
167,LG V40 ThinQ,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-v40-thinq,review-5801.html","Now that nearly every flagship smartphone sports an edge-to-edge display, what's the next big trend? We're betting on cameras — specifically, the number of cameras arranged on the front and rear of a phone. The days of single lenses are over, but LG's new V40 ThinQ ($920 to $980) proves five shooters may be overkill.LG's V-series lineup is where the company tends to introduce features designed for serious content producers. The V40 continues that trend with three rear and two front cameras, with a slew of novelty photography features designed to get the most out of all those lenses.But in our testing, five cameras didn't necessarily deliver more amazing results than three lenses — or even two, for that matter.LG says that pre-orders for the V40 ThinQ start as early as today (Oct. 3) in some locations, though most carriers we've talked to seem to be starting pre-orders next week. The phone goes on sale beginning Oct. 18. T-Mobile is offering the phone for $920 ($30 a month over 24 months with a down payment of $200), Sprint for $960 (or $20 a month on an 18-month lease for qualifying users), Verizon for $980 (or $40.83 a month over 24 months) and AT&T for $950 (or $31.67 a month for 30 months on the AT&T Next upgrade program).Regional carrier U.S. Cellular will also sell LG's latest phone for $900.The V40's camera preview lets you choose between each lens's viewpoint with icons at the top of the screen. If you shoot in Triple Shot mode — found in the bottom menu bar next to options to shoot in Portrait, AI and Google Lens — the camera will capture a shot from each lens separately and also create a video that you can edit and even add music to.Using Triple Shot, you can't see a preview from each lens, so you're shooting blindly. I tried using this feature multiple times and never got three great results. The V40-created videos were definitely not worth sharing. I took the V40 to a butterfly conservatory in Houston and thought each lens would reliably capture different views of the colorful creatures perched on leaves. As you can see below, only the standard option is (barely) salvageable.I relied on the telephoto lens to zoom in on Charro, the conservatory's green iguana, and the V40 blew out his orange scales. The Note 9's optical zoom turned in a more detailed image with accurate colors.The V40 combines images from two lenses to create a Portrait effect in the rear camera and in selfie mode. Neither produced very good results.Every time I used Portrait to capture artistic shots, like a butterfly perched on a branch or a bunch of flowers in bloom, the effect was unimpressive. The butterfly Portrait turned out dark, especially compared to the one I shot on a Galaxy Note 9. A different angle focused on the background of the conservatory instead of the butterfly I was trying to bring into the foreground. And while you can adjust the V40's Portrait blur intensity, you can't change the area of focus.The V40 also requires you to be 1.3 feet away from your subject to blur the background, which is too close to capture a truly artistic portrait. The iPhone, for instance, requires an 8-foot distance to bring the subject into the foreground and blur the background, and that effect is much more dramatic. After comparing a shot of flowers in New York City's Bryant Park on the V40 and the Note 9's Live Focus (a portrait equivalent), I switched to the V40's AI mode and captured a much better shot with the camera's standard lens.Portrait selfies were better, even though the front-facing lenses blew out the background in the image I shot at Bryant Park. (Those are skyscrapers in the background, although you can't tell.) The Note 9's Portrait mode has better color accuracy, but also smooths out my skin in a slightly disturbing way.I wish LG had focused on making the V40's cameras the best cameras rather than packing a ton of gimmicky photography features into one device. LG's latest phone is easily bested by other camera phones on the market with fewer lenses, such as the Note 9. My pro tip for working with the V40's cameras: Toggle over to AI mode, pick the lens you want to shoot from and hope for the best.I still haven't quite mastered one of the V40's unique camera features, Cine Shot, but it's much more fun to play with than Portrait or Triple Shot.The tool creates something akin to a cinemagraph without the camera equipment, expensive software and technical expertise needed to create an image that moves ever so slightly.In the V40's camera preview, select Mode from the menu at the top of the screen and then choose Cine Shot from the array of options. A video recording preview will pop up so you can shoot a 3-second clip. After shooting, use your finger to select which area of the clip you want to animate.You can spend ages highlighting the video with your fingertip or scrubbing it with an eraser to get the animation spot on, but you can't return to a Cine Shot after saving to edit some more, which would be useful.My Cine Shots definitely didn't look like a pro took them (maybe because I spent all of a minute working on each one). You can see in this shot of a butterfly that I highlighted too much of the area behind the insect instead of zooming in on the wings. But the effect is definitely more eye-catching than a standard photo. Given enough time with the phone, I'm certain I can create a masterpiece.Like the G7 ThinQ, one of LG's other 2018 flagships, the V40 ThinQ has a notch that you can disguise with a software-based bezel. That notch contains the device's two front-facing camera lenses and a speaker. That's nothing special.LG decided not to go full OLED with its flagship G7 ThinQ earlier this year, but has since embraced it — first with the V30 and now in the V40. LG's latest device has an expansive 6.4-inch, quad-HD+ (3120 x 1440) OLED display to rival the Note 9's 6.4-inch OLED panel, and the result is pretty impressive.The V40 reached 571 nits on our light meter, just shy of the scores for the Note 9 (604 nits) and the iPhone XS (611 nits). The G7 ThinQ hit a whopping 900 nits, but its LCD panel didn't wow us outside of the lab.The V40's screen covers 160.4 percent of the sRGB color gamut and notched a 0.45 on the Delta-E test of color accuracy. (Numbers closer to zero are better on our color accuracy test.) Those are both solid numbers, though the Note 9's display is more impressive, covering 224 percent of the color gamut and scoring a 0.34 on the Delta-E rating. Samsung's displays are more colorful overall — they handily bested the iPhone XS Max, which can reproduce 123 percent of the color gamut.MORE: Best Phablet: Top Big Screen Phones (6 Inches or Larger)I streamed the same spooky Chilling Adventures of Sabrina trailer on the V40 and the Note 9 side by side and found them equally immersive. The Note 9 edges out the V40 slightly, due to its curved edges, but both displays captured Spellman Manor's rich, deep blacks and the scarlet red candles on Sabrina's birthday cake.The V40 continues the trend we've seen in every other LG phone these days: underwhelming battery life.The average smartphone lasts 9 hours and 48 minutes on our test, which involves continuous web surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network until the phone's battery is depleted. Top flagships this year have easily bested that average, with the Note 9 sailing past 11 hours and the iPhone XS Max lasting 10:38. The V40's 3,300-mAh battery is paltry by comparison, lasting just 8:48 on the Tom's Guide Battery Test.Like the G7 ThinQ (8:35), the V35 ThinQ (9:11) and even the V30 (6:35) before it, the V40 falls short of the battery life we've come to expect from smartphones in 2018. If you're going to spend $900-plus on a phone, its battery has to last. The V40's doesn't.The V40 ThinQ is a glossy slab all the way around, just like most phones on the market. It has a giant screen, like most phones on the market. It sports a notch, like, you guessed it, most phones on the market.There's nothing interesting about the V40's looks, except for its triple-lens camera array, which could catch some eyeballs.It is incredibly lightweight at 5.96 ounces, especially compared to the hefty, 7.1-ounce Galaxy Note 9, which has the same size display but is beefier overall.MORE: Best Android Phones - Top Rated Smartphones You Can Buy ...The V40 won't win any style awards, but it looks like pretty much any smartphone circa 2018, which might be good enough for most people.With Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 processor and 6GB of RAM, LG's V40 easily rivals this year's best Android flagships — on paper.And the V40 does turn in solid performance with those specs. The device won't blow you away, like the OnePlus 6 and its 8GB of RAM did, but I had no complaints with how the V40 handled apps, videos or games. The V40 scored 8,302 on the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance. That's in line with the Samsung Galaxy S9+, which has the same specs and scored 8,295. The Note 9 also has an 845 processor and 6GB of RAM and scored 8,876.In everyday use, the V40 handled tasks with ease. On a quick mission in the graphically demanding PUBG Mobile, there was no lag as I ran around picking up weapons and defending myself against enemies. The brilliant blue of the sky and the green of the trees were stunning.MORE: iPhone XS Max vs Galaxy Note 9: Which Big-Screen Phone Wins?The V40 ThinQ is shipping with Android 8.1 Oreo and LG hasn't provided a timeline for when (or if) the new device will be updated to Android Pie. That's another consideration if you're in the market for an Android flagship today.LG's V40 ThinQ is expensive. Looking at a spec sheet, the device seems to offer a lot for the money: massive (nearly) bezel-free OLED display, five camera lenses, solid performance with the latest processor and support on every major U.S. carrier.But in practice, the cameras seem gimmicky instead of high end. The results don't look like they were shot on a DSLR, which has become my bar for an expensive camera phone. With so many other smartphone makers adding (or rumored to be adding) extra lenses to their devices, splurging on this particular LG handset is a decision you may regret in a few months.The V40's below-average battery life confirms its fate. Spend your hard-earned dollars on a Galaxy Note 9 instead if you're an Android owner looking for a top-performing camera phone, or hold out for the upcoming Pixel 3.Credit: Tom's Guide"
168,iOS 12,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ios-12,review-5744.html","Truth be told, I haven't thought that much about iOS 12 since the public beta came out earlier this year. That's not because I've ignored Apple's latest iOS update — I installed it the first day the public beta became available on the iPhone I use as my every-day mobile device. Instead, I haven't thought that much about iOS 12, because the new OS has performed pretty well for me these last three months, with its major enhancements fitting nicely into my daily workflow.That's an important thing to keep in mind, now that iOS is ready for anyone with a compatible iPhone or iPad to download. iOS 12 isn't an exactly a ground-breaking update for a mobile OS, but it's not a phone-breaking update, either, and I think the latter was more of Apple's goal this time out.iPhone owners don't face the same waiting game that you have to play with an Android device, where your phone might not get a major OS update until long after Google releases. If you have an iPhone that's capable of running of a new iOS version, you can download it the very day Apple makes the update available.In the case of iOS 12, that's a lot of devices. In addition to the new iPhone XS and XS Max shipping this Friday (Sept. 21), iOS 12 works on the iPhone 5s and later. That means if you bought a new phone since 2015, it's almost certain to run iOS 12. The new OS also works on the iPad mini 2 and later, fifth-generation iPad and later, any iPad Pro and any iPad Air; you can also upgrade to it if you're holding on to a sixth-generation iPod Touch.Generally speaking, the safe bet is to wait until Apple rolls out first update following a major iOS release. That way, you can see if other iPhone owners experience any issues before you take the plunge, and you give Apple the chance to stomp out any nettlesome bugs. This was certainly the smart play with iOS 11, which turned out to have its share of lingering issues.With iOS 12, though, Apple seems to have paid attention to ensuring that things run smoothly. (More on that in just a second.) Having used the beta since it came out, I ran into only a handful of glitches, none of them a showstopper and nearly all resolved with a subsequent update.MORE: New iOS 12 Features That Make Your iPhone BetterIf I have one concern with committing to iOS 12, it's battery life. Historically, iOS updates tend to drain phone batteries at a more rapid clip until subsequent updates can tweak things, and at various points in the iOS 12 beta process, I've had to plug in my iPhone a little bit earlier in the day than usual. But I'm also running iOS 12 on a two-year-old iPhone SE, and the nature of my job means that iPhone screen is going to be active a lot. So your mileage may vary.No OS launch is ever bug-free, but based on my time with iOS 12, I think if you upgrade right away, you can expect a smooth and largely trouble-free experience.With iOS 12, Apple says it paid extra special attention to making sure the update didn't leave older devices in the lurch. In fact, iOS 12 may actually breathe some new life into your old iPhone.Specifically, Apple says swiping to launch the camera will be up to 70 percent faster with iOS 12, and that the on-screen keyboard will appear up to 50 percent faster. The real time-saver could be when tap to launch an app, where Apple says you could see up to a 2x improvement. We're talking seconds at most here, but iOS 12 potentially makes your iPhone a zippier device.The Tom’s Guide lab tested app launches on an iPhone 6s running the latest version of iOS 11, then upgraded to the iOS 12 beta and ran the same tests. Most apps — though not all — launched faster when the phone was running iOS 12. There was no noticeable improvement when it came to unlocking the phone, however. We’ll run these tests again, now that iOS 12 is ready for wider use.I haven't sat down with a smartwatch to time whether my iPhone SE is running faster now that it has iOS 12 on-board. The camera does launch quickly by swiping left from the lock screen, and when I launch Notes to jot down something, the keyboard does appear by the time I figure out what I'm going to say. Siri seems to take a little bit longer to respond to commands since I've started using iOS 12, but at the same time, it also does a better job of hearing what I have to say. When I told Siri ""set a timer for 5 minutes"" in iOS 11, it often only started hearing me at ""timer""; iOS 12 hears the whole command.MORE: 10 Awesome Hidden iOS 12 FeaturesThe bottom line: Installing iOS 12 on your older phone won't be like unboxing an entirely new iPhone. But you shouldn't see any slowdowns and your phone is likely to get peppier at certain basic tasks.The bigger change comes with the improved way iOS 12 handles notifications. In iOS 11, things were a bit of a mess, with one notification after another piling up on your lock screen.In iOS 12, those notifications are grouped together by app, so all those alerts that an HQ game is about to start are in one place, while score alerts from MLB's At Bat app are in another. Tap the stacked up notifications, and you can deal with them one by one or dismiss them in one fell swoop. It sounds like a small change, but it makes notification much easier to manage and far less annoying.iOS 12 also introduces a better way to keep notifications from constantly commanding your attention. Swipe left on a notification and a Manage option appears alongside the ability to view and clear notifications. Manage spares you a side-trip to the Settings app, let you manage your notifications for that specific app right then and there. You have the choice to turn off notifications entirely, or have them delivered quietly. Opt for the latter choice, and those notifications will still be there in Notification Center for you to review at your leisure; your phone just won't buzz and beep when they do arrive, sparing you one less distraction.There's one other notification-adjacent improvement in iOS 12 involving the OS's Do Not Disturb feature. Do Not Disturb is something I wish I used more during meetings and meal times, and now with iOS 12 adding location-awareness to the feature, I finally get my wish. When you activate Do Not Disturb now, your options will include keeping the feature on until you leave a specific location or for the duration of events in your calendar. That makes it easier than ever to keep phone calls, texts and other interruptions at bay.Clearly tech giants have gotten the memo that we're worried about our devices intruding too much on our daily lives, and they're making some effort to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. Google, for instanced, included Digital Wellbeing in Android 9 Pie to give you feedback on just how often your using your phone, and iOS 12's Screen Time is Apple's attempt to do much the same thing.Screen Time is no silver bullet. If you want to keep staring at your iPhone, there's nothing Screen Time's going to do to stop you, other than logging your behavior for its weekly report. Even if you use tools like Screen Time's App Limits feature — where you can impose restrictions on how long you use a specific app or category of apps like games or social networking, you can circumvent that limit easily enough with much tsk-tsking. Screen Time is no replacement for will power.But just like the activity rings on an Apple Watch inspire people to stand up and move around more, Apple is betting that the detailed data in Screen Time will give folks the information they need to change their habits for the better. And for some people, it's going to have an impact. Looking at the Screen Time data since I've been using the feature, I have taken steps to maybe spend a little less time gaming, and when the weekly report tells me that my average iPhone usage is down for the week, I do feel a little stir of pride.My daughter is still at at an age where her screen time is at my sufferance, but parents of older children who have their own iOS devices will appreciate the improved parental controls in iOS 12. This has been an area where Android inarguably offers more than iOS, so it's good to see Apple give parents greater controlSiri's got a couple things going against it as a digital assistant. It's not always the brightest bulb in the room, not when Google Assistant is right there, tapping into Google's ever-expanding knowledge graph. And too many of things Siri does do well remain hidden from view, often requiring you to stumble upon them.Apple's addressing the first issue by adding to Siri's smarts in iOS 12. For example, it knows about motorsports now, and it can give you calorie counts and nutritional information on food. As for the second issue, Apple's putting the power to create Siri commands in your hands with a new Shortcut feature.iOS 12 introduces a Shortcuts app. Debuting with this release of iOS 12 — it wasn't part of the public beta — Shortcuts taps into the power of the Workflow app Apple bought last year to help you create commands that initiate multiple actions, including those from third-party apps. (Developers got to play around with Shortcuts before the rest of us.) Imagine telling Siri that you're coming home, and having the digital assistant map a route, queue up your favorite playlist in the Music app and maybe even turn on connected devices like lightbulbs once you reach home. That's the promise, anyhow, and we hope to see if Apple delivers on it, now that we can try out Shortcuts for ourselves.The iOS 12 beta did give a little hint of Shortcuts' potential, though, if you went into Settings and tapped the Siri & Search menu. That includes a log of your recent activities across different built-in apps, which you can then turn into a specific Siri command if you perform those activities often enough. Remember how I like to have Siri set kitchen timers? I created a Siri Shortcut where when I tell Siri ""Cook waffles,"" it knows to set a time for five-and-a-half minutes.MORE: Here's How To Upgrade To iOS 12Siri's new Suggestions feature also figures to make the digital assistant more useful by remembering your favorite activities and when you typically perform them. It will then suggest those activities at what it assumes to be an appropriate time. At night, for example, I play my daughter lullabies off my iPhone right before bed, and Siri has started surfacing that playlist as a suggestion around the same time each night. Siri's suggestion is still buried on the Siri Suggestions screen I only see when I swipe down from the home screen, but it's a step toward making the assistant a more useful companion.Security features aren't headline grabbers in the way improvements to Siri or even tweaks to notifications are. But the changes Apple's introducing to iOS 12 may be the unsung heroes of this update.Start with passwords. The new OS automatically creates complex passwords, saving them in both Safari and apps so that you can use them again without a clever person cracking that ""password123"" code you set up for easily remembering. Those passwords also get saved to your iCloud keychain, making them available on your other Apple devices.If you're like me, you've set two-factor authentication on your iPhone, and if you're even more like me, you struggle to remember those four- and six-digit verification passwords that get texted to your phone to prove that you're really you. iOS 12 updates AutoFill where one-time passcodes temporarily appear as typing suggestions so that you don't have to fill your brain with a string of numbers that become useless the moment you've entered them.Finally, a security feature I enjoy is that iOS 12 will now flag passwords you've used over and over again. Head to Passwords & Accounts in Settings and use either Touch ID or Face ID to open the Website & App Passwords section. If you see an exclamation mark in a triangle next to a particular website or app, that means you're re-using a password, leaving yourself vulnerable in case one of the accounts using that password ever gets hacked.As for privacy, Apple says iOS 12's Safari prevents share buttons and comment widgets from tracking you without your permission, and advertisers won't be able to collect data on your iOS device's unique characteristics for the purposes of retargeting ads. It sounds nice, but I'll believe it when the ads that get served up to me don't reflect stuff I was browsing for just a little while ago.iOS 12's other improvements will either ring your bell or be met with a shrug depending on how frequently you use the updated or enhanced feature in question. Photos in iOS 12 is better about helping you discover old photos so that you'll do more sharing with family and friends. The search tool is also improved, bringing up suggested photos as you type to help you pinpoint the photos you're looking for.If you've got a phone with a TrueDepth camera up front — either an iPhone X or one of the new iPhones introduced this month — you get four new Animoji (koala, tiger, ghost and T. Rex). And Animoji now has a tongue detection feature that can recreate an animated version of you sticking out your tongue — either the pinacle of human achievement or a silly bell and whistle depending on your point of view.The biggest change, though, is a new Memoji feature in which you can create avatars of yourself (or at least an idealized version of yourself, with a multitude of ways to customize the virtual you). I've never really seen a point to Animoji myself, but Apple's certainly done a better job of creating human-like avatars than Samsung's AR Emoji can muster.There's a new built-in app called Measure, which uses augmented reality to measure the height, width and depth of real-world objects. It's useful enough should you need to measure something and don't have a tape measure handy, but the real value of iOS 12's new AR tools, which include the ability to share AR experiences with other iPhone users in the same room, will be apparent once more developers come out with apps built using ARKit 2. I'm thinking the multiplayer version of Galaga that Apple showed off at its iPhone XS launch.One of the most significant things about iOS 12 may be a promised feature that isn't there with this release. When previewing iOS 12 this past June, Apple showed off a group FaceTime feature that would have allowed you to squeeze 32 people onto a video call. Let's simply say that the group video chat experience was nowhere near up to snuff when I tested it in an early version of the public beta, and clearly, I wasn't the only person who thought so. Apple shelved group FaceTime chats, promising the feature will return at a later date.MORE: New iOS 12 Features That Make Your iPhone BetterIt might be a worrisome sign that such a prominent feature would be a no-show for iOS 12's rollout. But I actually take the opposite view: the fact that Apple was willing to punt on a feature that got significant stage time during the Worldwide Developers Conference because it wasn't ready for prime time just underscores the importance the company is placing on stability with iOS 12.It's understandable after reading all that if you still want to hold off before installing iOS 12 on your iPhone until it becomes more clear that this update's enhancements far outpace and flaws. There's no punishment for waiting a couple weeks to get a new version of iOS up and running, after all.But if you do upgrade, you're in for a better experience, thanks to the changes to notifications, security and even Siri. Apple's attention to under-the-hood improvements could help ease the transition for your older iPhone and Screen Time just might help you make better use of your mobile device.Credit: Tom's Guide"
169,Alcatel 7,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/alcatel-7,review-5717.html","Cheap phones: They're ubiquitous, rarely exciting and often make promises they never keep.However, they are important, especially when the prices of high-end models continue to skyrocket. In fact, we need good, cheap phones now more than ever.That brings us to the $179 Alcatel 7. The latest handset from the TCL-owned budget brand offers an 18:9 full-HD+ display, dual cameras and basic facial recognition for those who find fingerprint sensors so 2017. In those ways, you could argue that the Alcatel 7 fulfills all the basic requirements of a modern phone.Unfortunately, it turns out that the Alcatel 7 isn't one of those devices that belies its attractive price. Rather, it's one that costs so little because it offers so little. And anyone who can afford to spend a bit more shouldn't have any reservations about opting for something like the $199 Honor 7X instead.The Alcatel 7 is available exclusively through MetroPCS for $179, though the prepaid carrier's site currently lists it at $29 for those who port their numbers from other networks. Of course, you'll have to commit to a qualifying plan with MetroPCS to get that low price, and the device is SIM locked — so you can't buy one and then immediately ditch the carrier for one of its competitors.A fine-enough LCD display, long battery life and occasionally impressive cameras give the Alcatel 7 a few upsides.Display: The Alcatel 7's 6-inch LCD display isn't anything special, but it gets the job done. These days, even the cheapest phones have decent screens, and this handset is yet more proof of that.Alcatel didn't cut corners with the resolution on its latest budget phone. You'll find the same full-HD+ experience you get from much more expensive models, which is definitely a nice bonus. Visibility is also consistent across all viewing angles.That said, this isn't a particularly bright display, nor a vivid one. At 443 nits, the Alcatel 7's peak full-screen brightness falls well short of the Honor 7X's 510 nits and the smartphone average of 466 nits.MORE: Best Smartphones - Here Are the 10 Best Phones AvailableColor representation is a bit flat too, with the handset able to reproduce only 110 percent of the sRGB color space. That's serviceable among LCD-powered budget devices, but unlike some of Alcatel's competitors, the company doesn't offer different display profiles for more- or less-saturated experiences.Battery Life: If the Alcatel 7 has one saving grace, it's the phone's battery life. This handset far exceeds the smartphone average of 9 hours and 48 minutes.It took 11 hours and 3 minutes of loading web pages on MetroPCS' LTE network for the Alcatel 7 to run out of juice. That's thanks to the handset's sizable 4,000-mAh battery, which is quite generous for the phone's low price.And, in an unusual perk you don't often see on such inexpensive phones, the Alcatel 7 features a USB Type-C port, which supports TCL's Pump Express 2.0 protocol. In theory, that should mean the phone can go from dead to 50 percent in just a half-hour when connected to the stock adapter. However, in our testing the Alcatel 7 reached just 33 percent in that same time period.Camera: No, the Alcatel 7's 12-megapixel main camera and secondary 2-MP shooter aren't going to produce the kinds of photos that rival Apple's ""Shot on iPhone"" series.But I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the images I captured with this handset.We put the Alcatel 7 face-to-face with Honor's dual-lens-toting 7X in a photo shoot-out, and the Alcatel 7 actually emerged as the winner in a few key comparisons, like the above shot captured inside our New York office. Honor's handset better exposes the background and avoids blowing out the highlights, but the entire right side of the frame is foggy. The colors are also far too muted compared with what Alcatel's shooter achieved.A similar result played out when I used both phones to capture some roses in Bryant Park. The Alcatel 7 extracted much more color and texture from the petals and leaves than the Honor 7X did. The warmer white balance is also more true to life.For the final round, I switched on HDR mode for both phones. And, once again, the Alcatel 7 painted a livelier shot. Things did get unrealistically bright near the ceiling and the light source, but the improved visibility in the shadows, extra pinch of saturation and greatly increased sharpness produced the kind of photo you'd be much more willing to show your friends.For the couple of things the Alcatel 7 gets right, these downsides make it unworthy of your consideration.Performance: On paper, the Alcatel 7's MediaTek Helio P23 processor should offer performance comparable to the likes of the Moto G6 and Nokia 6.1, two of our favorite sub-$300 handsets. The benchmarks would indicate as much, with Alcatel's offering posting a multicore Geekbench 4 result of 3,604 — well within 300 points of the marks from those other class-leading devices.As it turns out, however, those tests don't tell the whole story, because the Alcatel 7 is painfully slow in the real world.To put it bluntly, this is a phone that operates on its own schedule. Taps are treated like suggestions, not commands. Apps are never in any hurry to open, and the keyboard lingers around for an extra second or two before disappearing when you're done using it. Animations for just about everything — even unlocking the phone — play back choppier than a bad GIF. Sometimes, the phone even hesitates to go to sleep when you press the power button.MORE: The Most Anticipated SmartphonesThis might be a case of bad optimization on Alcatel's part, but the stronger likelihood is that the phone is bottlenecked by its paltry 2GB of RAM. Whatever the cause, there are many other devices in the same price range that perform leagues better, and some even approach flagship-caliber smoothness. In other words, there's no reason anyone should have to settle for such a sluggish experience.Software: The Alcatel 7 runs a fairly stock version of Android 8.1 Oreo. Normally, that'd be cause for celebration, but being that this is a subsidized carrier exclusive on a discount network, well, we can't have nice things.MetroPCS has packed loads of bloatware into the Alcatel 7, including its own app store. Thankfully, most of it can be disabled alongside the phone's other preinstalled apps, like streaming service CloserTV, NextRadio and the free version of the WPS Office productivity suite.The Alcatel 7 doesn't offer much in the way of exclusive features, but the company's Face Recognition feature does allow you to unlock your phone simply by looking at it. As with other Android devices, this isn't a secure form of authentication like Apple's 3D-aware Face ID tech; Alcatel's system cannot be used to verify payments, nor anywhere other than the lock screen.I can accept these limitations. The bigger problem is that Alcatel's face unlock is not nearly as fast as those on competing phones. As a result, you'd probably be much better off sticking with the tried-and-true fingerprint sensor.Design: I struggled to decide whether to write about the Alcatel 7's design in this review, because doing so would imply that it has some — which is debatable.The Alcatel 7 reminds me of a prop smartphone you might see in a TV spot for car insurance. It's a nondescript, plastic slab with a screen and absolutely no identifiable visual characteristics. And, in that way, it's almost shocking. Upon seeing it for the first time, you doubt that something so generic could actually exist in the real world for any reason other than to evoke the vague concept of a smartphone without infringing on any copyrights.MORE: When Is Your Kid Old Enough for a Smartphone?But exist it does, and to be fair, the Alcatel 7 is by no means an offensively designed product. It's just impossibly bland, and considering it's clad head to toe in plastic, it doesn't feel particularly well-built, either.These days, you don't have to spend much to get a phone that satisfies most of your needs. Finding a handset that actually fails in multiple areas is challenging with Android and iOS being nearly perfected and mobile processors and components more capable than those in some PCs from not very long ago. A decade of market and technology maturation has produced a flood of decent smartphones, and a handful that go above and beyond.But the Alcatel 7 doesn't fall in either category. It's that rare device that gets far more wrong than it gets right, where even an acceptable camera and superlow price tag can't excuse its anemic performance and myriad other flaws. Spend a little more and nab something like the Moto G6, the Nokia 6.1 or the Honor 7X. You'll save yourself a lot of frustration, and another device will last you much longer.Credit: Tom's Guide"
170,Huawei P20 Pro,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/huawei-p20-pro,review-5327.html","One look at Huawei's latest flagship, with its trio of Leica-branded cameras and optional color-shifting purple finish, and a serious case of FOMO sets in. The P20 Pro won't even be offered in the United States, but the phone has still captivated worldwide interest, precisely for its quirks.It's a far cry from Huawei’s last high-end handset, the Mate 10 Pro — which strangely enough is sold here, but has struggled to get noticed by American consumers, due to a combination of geopolitical distrust and a lack of truly distinctive features.But standing out isn't a problem for the P20 Pro. Unlike the Mate line, which Huawei aims squarely at business types, Huawei's P-series flagships are designed for creatives. And that focus shows: the P20 Pro is more fun: to look at, to show off to your friends and to use — especially when snapping memories of a night on the town.The P20 Pro isn't perfect, but it is a step forward for the globe's No. 3 smartphone maker, and the device it should have relied upon to boost its U.S. profile.Update (Aug. 31): Huawei has introduced new colors and configurations for the P20 and P20 Pro. More information is provided in the Price and Availability section.The 6.1-inch P20 Pro and its smaller, dual-camera-toting sibling, the P20, are offered in most markets around the world — including Canada — but will miss the U.S. entirely.In Europe, the P20 Pro retails for 899 euros, while U.K. customers have to pony up 799 pounds (compared to 659 euros and 599 pounds for the smaller P20). That translates to about $1,110, which makes the device nearly as expensive as the 256GB iPhone X. The P20 Pro originally released in four colors: Twilight (pictured in this review), Champagne Gold, Pink Gold and Midnight Blue.Following Berlin's IFA conference in August, Huawei introduced another four colorways (pictured above): Morpha Aurora (reminiscent of Twlight, but with a rainbow effect), Pearl White, and two leather-clad shades. The brown leather variant carries gold trim, while the black leather is partnered with silver. Both of the leather phones come with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, though pricing has not yet been revealed.However, there is a glimmer of hope for stateside consumers. Unlocked models of the P20 Pro sold across Europe and Canada still support GSM carriers in the U.S., such as T-Mobile and AT&T. While foreign phones are never guaranteed to work on networks other than those for which they were designed, our P20 Pro (model CLT-L29) ran about as well as any other device we've tested with a T-Mobile SIM on-board. Users in rural areas, however, may encounter more trouble securing a stable connection. If you're considering importing a P20 Pro, be sure to read our dedicated guide before taking the plunge.   The notches are coming. Launched with the Essential Phone and popularized by the iPhone X, many of the flagship handsets set to drop during the back half of 2018 are either known or heavily rumored to have cameras and earpieces jutting into their displays. That includes the OnePlus 6, LG G7 ThinQ and Asus ZenFone 5Z —  not to mention the successors to 2017's notched devices.Count the P20 and P20 Pro among the notch-sporting crowd. Huawei's notch is one of the smaller ones we've seen to date, but it has still ruffled some feathers — which is precisely why the company includes an option to ""disable"" it. This setting conceals the spaces to the left and right of the dock in total darkness. However, these regions are still used to relay the time and notifications, which may actually look even stranger.Then there's the P20 Pro's other party piece — that glass back, which comes in several different colorways, though only one really matters. Huawei is heavily promoting the Twilight blend of lavender and cyan in all the P20 Pro's marketing materials, and it's certainly worthy of the attention. Half of my colleagues fell in love with it (myself included), while the other half replied with a curt ""that's too much."" Your opinion will likely inform how you feel about the P20 Pro's other, more traditional flavors.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowIn any color, though, the P20 Pro's design isn't remarkable. We're dealing with the same materials here — glass enclosed by a chrome frame — that appear in so many other expensive handsets. It's also no less slippery or resistant to scratches. Our unit, which was never  dropped, almost immediately took a nasty slash opposite the Leica logo, with a couple more scuffs near the bottom edge, along the curve that melds into the frame. What good is that gorgeous Twilight back if you have to keep it all covered up with a case?Still, there are some pleasing little touches, like the power button with its orange accent, or the Huawei logotype and Leica branding that sit vertically in line with the three cameras and flash. These elements lend a flair of quality and craftsmanship not unlike the cameras produced by the esteemed Leica.Measuring 6.1 inches with a resolution of 2240 x 1080, the P20 Pro's OLED screen is sharp, but not quite as sharp as others in the segment.If you look closely, it's easier to discern individual pixels than on the iPhone X or either model of Samsung's Galaxy S9. Huawei's handset also comes up short regarding peak full-screen brightness, topping out at 461 nits, compared with the 574-nit iPhone X and the 620-nit Galaxy S9+.Truthfully though, you'd only notice these setbacks looking at the P20 Pro side by side with one of its rivals. The P20 Pro re-created 132.1 percent of the sRGB color space using its Normal color mode, which is adequate for a phone with a more realistic display profile. (For reference, the iPhone X, which also favors less saturated hues, measured 128.6 percent.) The P20 Pro's Delta-E color accuracy rating of 1.11 was fair as well, though the iPhone X surpasses it at 0.27. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.)Those who prefer colors that  pop will be pleased to know there's an optional Vivid display mode lurking in the settings. Ultimately, Huawei has gifted the P20 Pro with a fine panel, but considering how expensive the device is, the screen isn't as impressive as it probably should be.The P20 Pro would be an otherwise ordinary handset, if not for its triple lenses — a world's first for smartphones.The primary camera is rated at a whopping 40 megapixels, but Huawei also increased the size of the image sensor so that it's significantly larger than what's inside Apple, Google and Samsung's flagships.MORE: The Huawei P20 Pro's Camera Beats the iPhone X, Pixel 2 XLThat means the P20 Pro can capture super-crisp shots without sacrificing light — a common problem with high megapixel counts. It also uses all that extra visual information to bind pixels together, producing a 10-MP image with less visual noise and better color accuracy than you'd otherwise have.The other two cameras aid the main sensor, depending on the scenario. The 20-MP monochrome lens concentrates on luminosity, because it doesn't need to record color. That, coupled with its extra-wide f/1.6 aperture, helps improve low-light shots. The third camera on the P20 Pro is an 8-MP telephoto with a longer focal length, well-suited for Portrait Mode. It's also the camera used for 3x optical zoom.The upshot of all of this is that the P20 Pro has the hardware to support anything you could possibly want to shoot. But hardware only tells half the story, because Huawei has coupled innovative software with the P20 Pro's trio of lenses.There's Master AI — an iteration upon software Huawei first implemented in the Mate 10 Pro, that changes exposure parameters to match scenes and objects the onboard neural processor recognizes. But the P20 Pro's greatest imaging breakthrough comes courtesy of its AI Stabilization and Night Mode —  two systems that work in concert to consistently deliver the best low-light photography we've ever witnessed from a smartphone.Because longer exposures allow more light to reach the sensor, Night Mode keeps the shutter open for a full 4 seconds. Here's the kicker though: You don't need a tripod. AI Stabilization is astonishingly better at eliminating hand shake than it has any right to be.Night Mode only falters with moving objects — something visible in the above scene, where the building at the center of the frame is adequately exposed with good detail and color, but the trees swaying in the wind have been lumped together into a smeary pastiche with the sky.In daylight, the P20 Pro is decidedly less impressive. Up against the Galaxy S9+, Huawei's telephoto lens rendered its portrait of my colleague Jorge with more precision at the expense of washed out hues. Interestingly, using the telephoto for Portrait Mode eliminated the background bokeh effect — meaning if you want that shallow depth-of-field look, you'll have to rely on the standard zoom lens, which employs a much less flattering wide perspective.This shot of a flower illustrates how Huawei's Master AI can sometimes take ""smart"" processing too far. The P20 Pro has a penchant for oversharpening and cool colors. In most cases, the software compensates for that by dialing up the saturation, as it tends to with nature scenes. But that inevitably leads to the opposite issue — photos that look fake and obviously shopped, that are almost grotesquely vivid.Up front, there's one more camera above the P20 Pro's display: a 24-MP shooter with an f/2.0 aperture. All those extra pixels certainly make for sharper selfies on Huawei's device, especially when compared with Samsung's 8-MP front-facing unit. The colors could be a bit punchier, however.Instead of using Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors as other top Android phones do, Huawei builds its own chipsets for its mobile devices. The Kirin 970 inside the P20 Pro is about on a par with last year's Snapdragon 835, but the newer 845 chip inside the Galaxy S9 outpaces it.In Geekbench 4, a benchmarking app that measures overall performance, the P20 Pro's 6,240 score was trounced by the Galaxy S9+ at 8,295. A similar story played out in 3D Mark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test, where Huawei's device mustered only 2,991, compared with 4,634 from Samsung's handset.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThose numbers might seem like quite the indictment for what is ostensibly supposed to be a flagship product that costs as much as competing phones with newer, faster silicon. However, they don't tell the whole story.The P20 Pro is fitted with 6GB of RAM, just like the Galaxy S9+, Note 8 and the now-discontinued OnePlus 5T. Coupled with the still-capable Kirin 970, that's more than enough computational headroom for multitasking and games. Huawei's customers also get the benefit of the Kirin 970's dedicated AI subprocessor, which enables the aforementioned camera recognition and intelligent filters.Playing the mobile version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds on the P20 Pro and Galaxy S9+ was a mostly equal experience, save for a very slight frame rate advantage in Samsung's favor. It didn't benefit my performance, however — I totaled just two kills on both devices, and the P20 Pro’s hiccups were infrequent and didn't hinder the experience.Packed with a 4,000-mAh battery that puts most competing devices to shame, our P20 Pro turned in 14 hours and 13 minutes streaming web pages on T-Mobile LTE before shutting down. That's not far off Huawei's other flagship, the Mate 10 Pro, which clocked 14 hours and 39 minutes in the same test.That result places the P20 Pro comfortably above the longest-lasting products in its class, including the Pixel 2 XL at 12:09, the iPhone 8 Plus at 11:16 and the Galaxy S9+ at 10:59.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeNo flagship from any other phone maker matches the longevity of either of Huawei's offerings. That feat not only speaks to the efficiency of the Kirin 970 chipset, but Huawei's ability to cram massive batteries into handsets that are no thicker than its rivals.Because of the P20 Pro's lack of U.S. availability, we relied on the same adapter Huawei packs with the American version of the Mate 10 Pro to test the P20 Pro's charging speed. Both devices employ identical chipsets, support the company's exclusive SuperCharge protocol and even have the same capacity, so we weren't surprised to find the results align. The P20 Pro reached 57 and 91 percent after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively, while the Mate 10 Pro made it to 60 percent in 30 minutes.If you're paying the equivalent of $1,100, you shouldn't have to settle for last year's version of Android. Thankfully, Huawei agrees, which is why the P20 Pro is one of a chosen few devices — including the aforementioned Mate 10 Pro — to support Oreo 8.1.That means you can expect all the trappings of Oreo — picture-in-picture mode, notification dots, expanded Autofill support for forms and the like — coated in Huawei's characteristic EMUI interface.I've spoken at length about EMUI in reviews of Huawei and Honor's products in the past, and there's nothing in the P20 Pro's repertoire that makes me reassess my unfavorable opinion.EMUI is one of the most aggressive re-skins of Android you'll find from any manufacturer. Everything — from the way settings are organized, to the use of SwiftKey as the stock keyboard, to the lack of an app drawer on the default configuration of the home launcher — behaves at least a little differently compared with other devices. Some users will roll with the changes, while others will surely call for a simpler experience closer to Google's vision for the platform.For what it's worth, EMUI provides features you won't find in the Pixel 2, like Private Space, which allows users to create a secret secondary profile on their device linked to an alternate fingerprint. But it's wrapped in a graphic style that evokes iOS knockoffs from five years ago, that feels plainly at odds with Huawei's modern industrial design and innovative camera technology.  Huawei set out to build the best smartphone camera in the world with the P20 Pro. And while the company didn't completely succeed, it managed a solution to a problem that has dogged the likes of Apple, Google and Samsung for the better part of a decade: taking photos in the dark.On that basis alone, the P20 Pro is a special product that finally classifies Huawei as an innovator, rather than just another company that also makes decent phones. But low-light photography is merely one facet among a host of considerations customers make when they buy a phone. In those other respects, the P20 Pro is good, but not great.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialAnd then there's the availability dilemma. If the P20 Pro was sold in the States, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to those looking for a quirky alternative to the status quo. However, upward of a grand is a hefty sum to plunk down on a high-end handset with no guarantee that it will connect to the LTE networks where you live, and no  warranty if something goes wrong.The P20 Pro's price seems especially steep when you look at the competition. The Galaxy S9 and iPhone X grant faster performance and prettier displays, while the Pixel 2 brings a camera that is better than Huawei's in most situations, not to mention a truly modern Android experience. Worse yet for Huawei, all those phones start considerably cheaper, too.If you have your heart set on the P20 Pro, you won't be disappointed. For everyone else on this side of the Atlantic, though, the benefits simply don't outweigh the risks.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
171,Asus ZenFone 5Z,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/zenfone-5z,review-5698.html","Asus wants a slice of the pie. No, not that Pie — the company hasn't updated its smartphones to the latest version of Android quite yet. Rather, it wants to edge its way into the budget flagship niche market that OnePlus and Honor have dominated in recent years.That explains the $499 Asus ZenFone 5Z, a Snapdragon 845-powered handset with looks reminiscent of the iPhone X and a hodgepodge of features containing ""AI"" in the label.That may as well describe half the premium Android phones we've seen this year, but it's hard to be cynical about that price — the ZenFone 5Z costs $30 less than the $529 OnePlus 6 and boasts the kind of power most companies typically demand hundreds more for.However, specs tell only half the story, and the ZenFone 5Z's knockoff looks and nonintuitive software won't have you mistaking it for a $1,000 iPhone X. If you can put up with that, Asus' latest offering is a terrific value.The ZenFone 5Z costs $499 and comes in a single configuration featuring 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The latter can be expanded by up to 2TB with a microSD card, though using external memory consumes one of the phone's dual SIM slots. Two colors are available — Midnight Blue and Meteor Silver — and the ZenFone 5Z is available through Asus' website, Amazon and B&H.Because the ZenFone 5Z is GSM unlocked, only users of GSM networks — like AT&T, T-Mobile, MetroPCS and Cricket — will be able to run the phone on their carriers' networks. That means Verizon and Sprint subscribers are out of luck.Personally, I've never been a fan of the iPhone X's design. The notch is one thing, but my gripes really lie with the uninspired materials, the monotone color selection and the way the camera housing looks looks like an afterthought that was tacked on at the last possible minute.Bearing all of that in mind, I'd love nothing more than to see a phone maker not merely copy Apple's design, but improve upon it. Asus did the former, but it couldn't accomplish the latter with the ZenFone 5Z.This isn't a bad-looking phone; it's just an ordinary one. The notch is narrower, but a bit deeper, than the iPhone X's. The bottom bezel is considerably thicker than those on every other side of the screen — a reminder that Asus and its fellow Android phone makers still haven't found a way to wrap the display driver around itself to deliver a truly consistent experience.The ZenFone 5Z isn't water-resistant, but it feels durable, with a matte aluminum frame bridging two slabs of Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and back. Unfortunately, that glass build doesn't mean this phone supports wireless charging. On the bright side, the backside incorporates a layer of varnish that produces a concentric metallic pattern around the fingerprint sensor when the light strikes it just right.Most of the time, though, our Midnight Blue model just seemed a really dim gray. Aside from the presence of that notch, the ZenFone 5Z doesn't look or feel appreciably different from the $299 ZenFone 5Q I tested a few weeks ago.Although Asus doesn't use an OLED display in the ZenFone 5Z, there's nothing wrong with the phone's 6.2-inch, full-HD-plus LCD panel.In fact, you wouldn't really know what you were missing unless you placed it right next to a OnePlus 6. The ZenFone delivers a wide swath of color that's vivid but not oversaturated, reproducing 176 percent of the sRGB color space and reaching a peak full-screen brightness of 566 nits. For comparison, the OnePlus 6 managed 240 percent and 574 nits on those tests.In the trailer for The Meg, the water was ever so slightly a deeper shade of turquoise through the screen of the OnePlus 6 than it was on the ZenFone 5Z. However, the 5Z's screen felt brighter (even if the readings from our light meter say otherwise), seemed sharper and preserved more detail, even deep within the ocean depths.Like many other phones do, the ZenFone 5Z gives you the choice to calibrate the screen to your liking. You could opt for the more muted Standard setting, or what Asus calls Wide Color Gamut mode, which favors more saturated hues. No setting will give you the inky-perfect blacks of an OLED display, but this ZenFone does a fine enough job with LCD tech.Asus often promises a top-notch photography experience in its phones, and the ZenFone 5Z attempts to achieve that with a pair of cameras on the rear. The main 12-megapixel, f/1.8 lens features AI-aided scene detection that can identify 16 different scenarios, including flowers, cityscapes and more. It's joined by a secondary 8-MP, f/2.0 lens used for 120-degree wide-angle photos as well as Portrait Mode.Does it all work? For starters, the ZenFone 5Z delivered a pleasing shot of New York's Bryant Park on a sunny August morning; in fact, the photo ended up strikingly similar to what the OnePlus 6 achieved in the same conditions. Asus' handset pulled more color out of the sky and grass, and the auto HDR mode shed a bit more clarity on the shadowy portions of the trees. However, once you zoom in on both images, you see that OnePlus' version trounces the ZenFone's photo in sharpness. That's appropriate, considering the OnePlus 6's main sensor packs four more megapixels than that of the ZenFone 5Z.For this shot of a flower, the ZenFone 5Z relied on the appropriate scene-detection mode. I had actually tried to capture a few images of flowers before this one, and the device typically failed to identify what it was looking at. As such, I was surprised to see the little plant icon pop up in the viewfinder in this case, indicating the AI software was doing its job.The results speak for themselves, though. Normally, I'm skeptical of cameras that employ smart object recognition, because the algorithms that phone makers typically bake into the software almost always ratchet up saturation to a cartoonish degree. But that didn't happen here, and although it's difficult to tell exactly what the software is doing in this example (there doesn't appear to be a way to turn off the feature or look at a before-and-after comparison), I prefer the more gradual contrast and consistent bokeh of the ZenFone 5Z's shot to what the OnePlus 6 provided.Unfortunately, the ZenFone's Portrait Mode couldn't keep the praise rolling. Neither phone did a great job here. The ZenFone 5Z managed a crisp but dim shot, not unlike what I observed from the cheaper ZenFone 5Q. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 6's attempt was much more evenly lit, but its white balance was overly warm. To complicate matters further, neither of these handsets has a telephoto lens, which means you get an ugly fish-eye perspective any time you try to capture a shallow depth-of-field portrait with the rear cameras.At least the ZenFone 5Z won some points back with its front-facing camera, which delivered a much more vibrant self-portrait than the OnePlus 6. While my skin tone isn't quite as red as Asus' phone might lead you to believe, there's definitely a little more color there than in the almost monochrome example from the OnePlus. However, the light falling into our office from the window blows out the background in the ZenFone's rendition — an issue the OnePlus 6 avoided.Here's where the ZenFone 5Z really makes a name for itself. This is the least-expensive phone you can currently buy with Qualcomm's top-of-the-line Snapdragon 845 processor on board.Even better, the ZenFone 5Z combines that speedy silicon with 6GB of RAM. All told, this is among the fastest Android smartphones on the market today, yet also somehow the cheapest in its class.That makes it an excellent choice for mobile gamers on a budget. I expected some dropped frames here and there while I was mired in a gunfight in PUBG Mobile, but the ZenFone 5Z ran like a champ, with zero slowdown on the HD graphics setting. The same was true when I went for a joyride in Asphalt 8. As far as the Android experience, apps and animations opened and unfolded with the blink of an eye.Therefore, I wasn't surprised to find the ZenFone 5Z turn in a score of 8,842 on the multicore Geekbench 4 overall performance test. That's not far off from the 9,098 achieved by the 8GB variant of the OnePlus 6. Impressively, the ZenFone 5Z nearly matches the Note 9's 8,876 score, even though it costs $500 less.MORE: Galaxy Note 9 Benchmarked: iPhone X Is Still FasterAsus' big-screen bargain also notched 4,683 in the OpenGL ES 3.1 version of 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme graphics test — slightly greater than the Galaxy S9+'s score of 4,634 but again shy of the OnePlus 6's 5,124.Armed with a 3,300-mAh battery, the ZenFone 5Z turned in 10 hours and 25 minutes of usage during our battery test, in which we have phones stream web pages over T-Mobile LTE until they run out of power.The OnePlus 6 lasted just 8 minutes longer in the same test, and those similar results are no coincidence — the OnePlus 6 has an identically sized battery that drives the same processor, as well as a display that's roughly the same proportions. Considering that the average of the other phones we've tested is 9:48, 10 and a half hours is nothing to sneeze at.Even better, Asus loaded the ZenFone 5Z with lots of fast-charging and battery-preserving tech. There's Quick Charge 3, which delivers 50 percent of juice in 30 minutes, and Asus' AI Charging, which limits stress on the battery by learning how long you typically leave your phone plugged in overnight and then modulating power delivery so that the device doesn't spend too long at full capacity.Like all of Asus' phones, the ZenFone 5Z layers the company's ZenUI front end over Android, which, in this case, is version 8.0 Oreo.This iteration of ZenUI is new, debuting with the 5Z. I've never particularly been a fan of ZenUI, but it's cleaner and easier to navigate this time around, partly because Asus has pared down the number of its own apps.But that's not to say Asus hasn't left its stamp on the software. New to the ZenFone 5 and 5Z is a collection of AI-branded apps, including the aforementioned AI Charging and AI Scene Detection.While those are novel features that do appear to rely on some level of machine learning, the other AI features — including AI Ringtone, Smart Screen and AI Boost — really don't fit the definition at all. AI Ringtone is like True Tone for your phone's alerts, automatically adjusting the volume of your ringer based on ambient noise. Smart Screen merely keeps the display lit when you're looking at it (hardly new by any means), while AI Boost simply prioritizes performance when the system recognizes you're playing a game or using ""compute-intensive apps.""It's not hard to imagine why the very concept of AI confuses people when companies brazenly overuse the term where it doesn't actually belong. These features could vaguely be defined as smart, and maybe responsive or automatic — but certainly not artificially intelligent.And then there's Zenimoji, Asus' answer to Apple's Animoji and Samsung's AR Emoji. Zenimoji look more similar to Apple's version. There are seven animals to choose from — including an owl, a horse and a fox — in addition to four human options. You can use Zenimoji during video calls (they're supported by Google's Duo app), and record clips or take pictures to share via any third-party messenger.MORE: Asus ZenFone 5Q ReviewThe cross-app support is nice, but the real problem with Zenimoji is the same one Samsung faced when it revealed AR Emoji: The animations are far from natural, and the characters themselves aren't terribly expressive.Animoji on the iPhone X react in real time, with a silky-smooth frame rate — almost as if you were looking at yourself in the mirror, albeit with the head of an alien or unicorn superimposed over your own. Zenimoji don't get anywhere close to that 1:1 goal, with twitchy eye tracking and an inability to detect obvious emotions, like smiles and frowns. It definitely needs more work.It's a great time to be in the market for a new Android phone, and that's because of handsets like the Asus ZenFone 5Z.Years ago, your only choice for a relatively inexpensive phone with the fastest processor available at the time would have been one of Google's Nexus products. That's changed, though, and the ZenFone 5Z is a great choice for customers interested in saving even more than they already would on the OnePlus 6, or for people who really want the iPhone X design in a handset that costs half the price.Of course, you'll still have to make compromises for spending so little. The 5Z's LCD screen isn't going to make your jaw drop in the same way OLED panels will, the cameras are good but not great, and some of the extra software features aren't as special as they're cracked up to be. The OnePlus 6 still offers better overall value. However, the ZenFone 5Z is a satisfying budget-priced flagship.Credit: Tom's Guide"
172,Oppo Find X,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/oppo-find-x,review-5687.html","The first several times I saw the Oppo Find X reveal its camera via its slide-out mechanism, I felt downright giddy. ""This is a damn clever way to do a full-screen phone,"" I said to myself. And then I said something else: ""Is this just a gimmick?""Yes, Chinese giant Oppo has found a way to obliterate bezels without copying the iPhone X's notch. The 6.4-inch Find X (about $850 unlocked, if you track it down from overseas) is also arguably the most beautiful phone ever made, thanks to its 3D glass design and stunning Glacier Blue or Bordeaux Red color.But Oppo also shamelessly copied features from both the iPhone X and latest Galaxy phones, and the dual rear cameras didn't blow me away as much as the design. Here's what I like — and don't like — about the Find X.The Find X is an absolute revelation of a design compared with the sea of iPhone X clones out there. The first thing I noticed about Oppo's phone was the lack of a notch or any bezels up front, as this flagship boasts a screen-to-body ratio of 93.8 percent. That’s because the front and rear cameras are hidden inside a sliding mechanism that's whisper-quiet (more on that below).I absolutely love the Glacier Blue back, which is made of Gorilla Glass 5 and is curved on both sides. (There's also a Bordeaux Red option.) Oppo used a multifaceted-coloring process and added a gradient to make the Find X look and feel like a gemstone. It's smooth in the hand but not slippery, and I love the way the color shifts as you turn the phone in your hand.Measuring 6.2 x 2.9 x 0.37 inches, the Find X is slightly shorter and narrower than the Galaxy Note 9 (6.3 x 3 x 0.34 inches, which makes sense given the slimmer bezels). The Find X is also lighter than the Note 9 at 6.5 ounces, compared with 7.1 ounces for Samsung's flagship, though the Note  has an S Pen on board.The aptly named Stealth 3D Camera on the top of the Find X automatically glides up both when you unlock the phone and when you fire up the camera app, and it reacts very quickly. You're ready to shoot in just 0.6 seconds. The mechanism is so smooth and quiet, you barely notice it.However, the retracting action sometimes took me by surprise and ever so slightly pinched my finger. If you're worried about durability, Oppo says the mechanism is rated for 300,000 retractions, but I still have to wonder about crumbs or other debris getting into this system over time and gumming up the works.The Vivo Nex S, another cutting-edge phone from China, also sports a pop-up camera but it's only for selfies. The back camera is always there.Oppo Find X Specs and PriceThe Oppo Find X sports two rear RGB cameras, one a 16-megapixel shooter and the other a 20-MP camera. The 2x optical zoom worked well in my testing, but I found that the phone could be slow to capture images, which I discovered when trying to shoot my dogs running around the back yard. There was definite shutter lag at times.In another instance, I snapped what at first looked like a great photo of a juggler but his arm looks blurred.In side-by-side shots with the iPhone X, the Find X's cameras delivered colorful and sharp photos, but some bright areas ran a bit hot outdoors.You can see the difference in this shot of a fountain I took at Bryant Park. The iPhone X's image looks warmer with more contrast, and you can make out more detail in the stone in the forreground. The flowers on the right side also look richer in the iPhone's photo.In a shot of skyscrapers in Bryant Park, the Find X's shot was just as good as what the iPhone X produced, if not better. The grass and trees has a darker green. However, the iPhone X's shot is brighter in the foreground, and I appreciate the warmer tone in the buildings.Indoors, the results were mixed when I took this photo in Grand Central Station. The Find X took a brighter photo and the clock is much more well defined. However, the iPhone X's image has less noise.The Find X's camera is supposedly capable of recognizing 21 independent scene categories, including Food, Character (people) and Puppy. But in my testing I found the camera slow to recognize these scenes, and the scene name would only sometimes pop up on screen.Similar to the Face ID feature on the  iPhone X, the Find X's 3D front camera can unlock the device. The system consists of a flood illuminator, infrared camera, receiver and dot projector. A laser generator projects more than 15,000 recognition spots on your face to build a precise 3D model.In bright sunlight and in complete darkness, I had no issues unlocking the phone simply by staring at the front after I swiped up on the display. The stealth camera pops up smoothly and retracts out of sight.MORE: Face ID Just Changed How You Unlock Your iPhoneKeep in mind that the Find X doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, and while the face recognition works in Oppo's home market of China for confirming payments, you won't be able to use Find X as a mobile wallet in the U.S.The 6.4-inch OLED display on the Find X is a beautiful canvas indeed. The screen burst with color as I played Tekken, and I could make out fine details in Luke Skywalker's beard as I watched The Last Jedi on Netflix.Our lab numbers back up this great experience, with the Find X's display displaying 231 percent of the sRGB color gamut. That's even higher than the Note 9 (224 percent) but behind the OnePlus 6 (240.3 percent). The Find X's screen also delivered a strong color-accuracy rating of 0.36; 0 is a perfect score.I just wish the display got brighter, as it averaged only 388 nits on our tests. Most flagship phone screens exceed 500 nits.Oppo also deserves credit for making the most of this panel with its full-screen multitasking feature. With this option enabled, you can swipe in from the left side to show a sidebar and launch apps in a floating window, such as Messages and Facebook Messenger. However, I didn't see a way to change which Quick Apps appear.That front camera does more than just unlock the Find X. If you're a selfie fan, you'll love the front camera on the Find X. It shoots 25-megapixel photos and leverages 3D AI Beauty technology.As I found out, the front shooter can make your face look thinner while smoothing out the wrinkles, and you can fine-tune the settings so the photos still look realistic.The reason this feature works so surprisingly well is that the Find X creates a precise 3D model of your face. Plus, you can preview the beautification options in real time.The Find X has so many settings you can spend a couple of days exploring them all, but the one you'll want  right away are under Smart & Convenient - Navigation Keys. There, you'll be able to choose between using traditional on-screen software buttons at the bottom of the screen (Back, Home Recent) or iPhone X-like gestures.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowI tried the latter mode, which enables you to swipe up to go to the home screen and swipe and hold to reveal recent tasks. Unlike the iPhone X, there's a third gesture that lets you swipe up on the bottom left or right side to go back.  These gestures worked well, but on a few occasions I had to swipe up multiple times for them to work.You can also go right into split-screen mode by swiping up on the screen with three fingers, and you can capture a screenshot by swiping down with three fingers.If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Apple and Samsung should be over the moon with Oppo's phone. The 3D Omoji feature on the Find X copies both Apple's Animoji and the AR Emoji feature in the latest Galaxy phones.If you turn on the front camera and click on Stickers, you'll see an option to turn your face into one of 10 different characters, including a duck, hippo and dragon. The Find X could barely tell when I lifted my eyebrows and, alas, there's no tongue detection like there is on the iPhone X.The personal 3D emoji, similar to Samsung's AR Emoji is creepier, as the Find X attempts to create a cartoonish version of your face. The end result didn't look very realistic, and it auto-generates several stickers you can use in messaging apps.The flattery doesn't stop there. The portrait-lighting options for the front-facing camera on the Find X are in the same location as they are on the iPhone X. Oppo uses a very similar-looking font to boot.The bottom part of the Find X houses a USB-C port and a SIM card tray, but you won't find a headphone jack on this handset. That means you'll have to either use an adapter or go the Bluetooth-headphone route.MORE: Best Bluetooth Speakers for Home or On-the-GoIn addition, the Find X forgoes wireless charging, which is a bummer. Fortunately, this phone does offer fast wired charging via USB-C. If you want to be able to pay for things with your phone, also note that the Find X doesn't support NFC.The Find X delivers flagship-level performance, thanks to its Snapdragon 845 processor and 8GB of RAM. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Find X scored 8,259. That's good, but not as fast as the OnePlus 6 with 8GB of RAM (9,088) and Galaxy Note 9 with 6GB of RAM (8,876).The Find X underperformed on 3DMark Slingshot Extreme compared with its competition. On that demanding graphics test, the phone notched 4,228. That's well behind the OnePlus 6 (5,124), the Galaxy Note 9 (4,639) and the iPhone X (4,994).In a real-world video-editing test using the Adobe Premiere Clips app, the Find X took 4 minutes to transcode a 4K video to 1080p. That's slower than the OnePlus 6 (3:45) and well behind the Galaxy S9 (2:32). The iPhone X took only 47 seconds.Unfortunately, the Find X was unable to run our web-surfing battery test, but, in general, I found that its 3,730 mAh battery held up well in real-world use. After unplugging the phone at 7 a.m. and using it throughout the day — including shooting photos and videos and playing some games — the battery was down to 27 percent by 8 p.m. ET.Oppo pours a lot of its own software on top of Android 8.1, including a half-hearted assistant that on the left of the home screen that provides things like quick function shortcuts, the weather, your current step count and upcoming events.The oversize icons on the home screen are also a bit of an eyesore; I would prefer something closer to stock Android.My biggest gripe has to do with needlessly duplicative apps, such as Photos. You simply don't need that when there's already Google Photos. Plus, I found it annoying that you can't edit photos in landscape mode in Oppo's app. Why the heck not? Lastly, several photos that I took didn't show up in the Google Photos app for some reason.The Find X is an overwhelming beauty, but the phone is also a bit overwhelming itself. On the plus side, the design is absolutely gorgeous, and the mechanical stealth camera is a marvel of engineering. The camera performance is also great, even if it's not best in class.However, the performance of the Find X isn't as fast as other flagship phones with similar specs, and the software is too heavy handed at times. I could also do without the Galaxy and iPhone copycat features.For enthusiasts, though, the Find X may be worth importing. Like the recent Vivo Nex S and its fingerprint-reading screen, it provides an exciting sneak peek at how phones could look and function in the not-too-distant future.Credit: Tom's Guide"
173,Moto Z3,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-z3,review-5669.html","Rather than imitating the parade of premium smartphones that have come before it, Motorola has chosen an unexpectedly conservative strategy with its latest flagship, the Moto Z3.First off, this is a Verizon-exclusive handset — which is a bit unusual in this day and age, when you can get almost any high-end phone on any network. Second, the phone costs just $480, which makes it a decent value for those Big Red subscribers who can't use the $529 OnePlus 6 on their network of choice. Oh, and sometime next year, Motorola will release a Moto Mod that will also make the device 5G capable.That low price may not make a whole lot of sense until you peer beneath the Moto Z3's familiar exterior. There you'll find last year's Snapdragon processor and even the same amount of memory and storage, making it — on paper at least — functionally a Moto Z2 Force in fresh clothes.It all leaves the Moto Z3 feeling like quite the anomaly among flagship phones — albeit one that invites an interesting question: Is the trade-off of generation-old hardware worth it just to save a couple hundred dollars? For some of the Verizon faithful, it will be. However, Motorola's modular platform doesn't fully excuse its cost-cutting measures, and getting an early glimpse of 5G tomorrow feels like something of an empty promise when it means buying an outdated phone today.There are several reasons to make the Moto Z3 your next smartphone.Decent value: It's hard to argue with $480. The Moto Z3 isn't quite Verizon's answer to the OnePlus 6 — after all, that attractively priced phone boasts more up-to-date specs. Yet, Moto's new phone is a serviceable alternative, not to mention much more well-rounded than the similarly specced, similarly priced Essential Phone.When you consider that an iPhone 8 or Samsung Galaxy S9 will set you back at least $700, the Moto Z3 becomes even more compelling. For less than $500, Z3 owners get a 6-inch AMOLED display, a still-speedy Snapdragon 835 processor, dual-lens cameras equipped with Portrait Mode and access to Moto Mods.Respectable performance: The Moto Z3 isn't going to set benchmarking records with its year-old Snapdragon 835 processor and 4GB of RAM — the same chip that drove the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Google Pixel 2. But the 835 is still plenty powerful for practically anyone, except maybe those who need to have the newest silicon on the market to play games like PUBG Mobile and Fortnite at the smoothest possible frame rates.The Moto Z3 delivered a 6,020 score in Geekbench 4, a test that measures overall system performance. That's still shy of the Z2 Force, which hit 6,524, as well as a bit behind the Pixel 2's 6,282 result. Newer phones, like the Galaxy S9, routinely turn in scores topping 7,000.3DMark's Sling Shot OpenGL ES 3.1 test, which deals in graphics performance, panned out similarly. Here, the Moto Z3 delivered 3,650 — in line with other 835-powered handsets — while the aforementioned Galaxy S9 finished at 4,617.The AMOLED display: With a peak full-screen brightness of 564 nits, the Moto Z3's 6-inch AMOLED display far exceeds the 488-nit average and comes within striking distance of the iPhone X's 574 nits.This screen employs a full-HD-plus resolution, which fits fewer pixels into the same space as Samsung's quad-HD-plus panels in its Galaxy S9 and S9+ while still looking sharp enough to the naked eye. The default Standard color setting only presents hues within the sRGB color space, which many will find muted and washed out. Conversely, you can easily opt for the Vibrant profile, which is less realistic but pleasingly saturated.In that Vibrant mode, the Moto Z3 covered 228 percent of the sRGB spectrum and registered a Delta-E color accuracy figure of 0.37. Both scores are about the same as what we witnessed from the Galaxy S9, even though the Moto Z3 is several hundred dollars cheaper. Add to that the superior contrast that OLED technology provides, and Motorola's flagship won't leave you yearning for a better display.  Moto Mods provide some freedom: While Motorola opted not to package the Moto Z3 with a Power Pack battery mod, which it had done for the less powerful Z3 Play, all the same Moto Mods that have been released over the last two years are compatible with this Verizon-exclusive variant.That ranges from the aforementioned battery-expanding accessories to a few different speaker attachments, a gamepad with physical buttons and inputs, a DSLR-like camera lens that replaces the phone's own and even a miniature Polaroid printer — just to name a few examples.Your mileage with Moto Mods will vary, of course. Our own Marshall Honorof, proud owner of a Moto Z2 Play, says that, for special occasions, the unique platform allows him to transcend the limitations of his phone in a way that he never could with other devices.Unfortunately, the mods themselves can still be quite pricey (we've yet to hear confirmation on the cost of that promised 5G mod, for one), and not all of them deliver on their promises. That said, those who have built up a collection of Mods in recent months can rest assured that it won't go to waste with the Moto Z3.Old design and less durable: The Moto Z3 borrows a lot from its Moto Z predecessors, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that its design has seemingly been lifted straight from the Z3 Play.It's a boring and safe choice, but not an entirely awful one: The Z3 Play is a handsome device. Its footprint is neither too small nor too big, it's got a slim profile, and, thanks to its new 18:9 aspect ratio, the bezels on this phone aren't excessively large. Additionally, Motorola stashed the fingerprint sensor in a cutout on the right edge, and it's a natural resting point for your thumb that works quite well.In other ways, though, the Z3 feels like a massive step back. We lauded the Z2 Force for its ShatterShield display — a proprietary technology developed by Motorola that incorporated five layers of protection and even came with its own four-year warranty. The Z2 Force was the only device that survived every one of our smartphone drop tests (save for the one that involved water), and brushed off a 6-foot drop onto concrete with nary a crack, thanks in part to its aluminum construction.But the Moto Z3 has no such protection. Instead, Motorola has employed the much more common (and as we found, not particularly strong) Gorilla Glass 3 on both the front and back of its new flagship. And when you consider that the phone still isn't water-resistant, at a time when practically all of its competitors are, the result leaves you with the nagging feeling that Motorola's heart was never invested in making the Z3 as good as it could be.   Unimpressive cameras: The dual 12-megapixel shooters on the back of the Moto Z3 can deliver solid photos, depending on the scenario, but they fall short of the best mobile cameras on the market.Motorola has supplemented the main f/1.7 lens in the Moto Z3 with another sensor that shoots exclusively in monochrome. That means the second lens can deliver genuine black-and-white shots. And it helps the Z3 pull off some other tricks, too, using such features like Spot Color, which lets you preserve color in specific aspects of the frame; and the Cinemagraph mode, which creates GIFs with partial movement.While the Moto Z3's feature set is solid, the quality of its photography is hit-or-miss. In the example above, taken in a picturesque alley on a beautiful summer day, Motorola's device delivered a sharper shot compared to the iPhone 8 Plus, though it paled in comparison to Apple's superior dynamic range, as evidenced by the blown-out sky.Venturing indoors, we see a similar situation play out. Here, the iPhone does a better job of exposing details in the darker regions, like the ceiling and floor. The Moto Z3 paints a pleasing picture overall, but when light is scarce, you'll want the iPhone's prowess in navigating the highlights and shadows.Apple's Portrait Mode is one of the finest in the business, and it also far outperformed Motorola's when we attempted a shallow depth-of-field still of a plant on a windowsill. Not only is the iPhone's attempt clearly brighter, but it's more sensitive to the boundaries of the foreground. In contrast, the Moto Z3 has a hard time discerning what's close from what's far away, and the lack of a true telephoto lens also produces a less artful fish-eye perspective.Subpar battery life: The Moto Z3's 3,000-mAh battery managed just 9 hours and 22 minutes during our battery test, in which the device streamed web pages endlessly until it ran out of juice on Verizon's network.That's about 26 minutes under our category average for smartphones and 40 minutes less than the Z3 Play and its energy-sipping Snapdragon 636 processor. Surprisingly, it's even an hour shorter than last year's Z2 Force, which had an identical chipset and a smaller, 2,730-mAh battery.Of course, you could spring for an external battery mod, like the $49, 2,200-mAh Power Pack that actually comes with the Z3 Play. With the help of that add-on, you'll have 5,200 mAh of charge, which should last you through two days of use. But the option of a mod doesn't excuse the poorer efficiency here.5G skepticism: In a test we witnessed at Motorola's headquarters, a prototype of the 5G Moto Mod achieved download speeds greater than 3 GBps — about 15 times faster than the best throughput you can get using LTE on most carriers right now.That's all well and good, but loads of questions still surround the 5G mod. We're told it will arrive sometime in early 2019, and thanks to dummy units Motorola prepared, we have an idea of how it will look connected to the Z3 Force. At the moment, that's all we know.We're still in the dark regarding when and where Verizon's 5G mobile network will launch; actually, the carrier has only shed light on its residential 5G infrastructure thus far, which consists of just four cities at the moment. Details on data speeds and limits remain nonexistent. And of course, both companies are keeping their lips sealed on the mod's price.That's more than a little concerning, because the first quarter of 2019 is not terribly far away. The 5G mod will feature Qualcomm's next-generation X50 5G modem as well as its state-of-the-art X24 LTE modem for higher LTE speeds than you'd traditionally achieve (and for those times when 5G connectivity isn't available). But the mod requires a separate battery to power them, which doesn't bode well for energy consumption (or price, for that matter).MORE: Moto Z3 Play Hands-On: A Modular Phone You Can AffordIn short, there's a ton of uncertainty surrounding the way Motorola and Verizon are approaching the launch of the first 5G-capable device. Even if the 5G mod delivers the blistering speed consumers expect, will the other potential trade-offs — concerning cost, coverage and all those other practical considerations — outweigh the benefit?It's just too soon to tell, which means it's also far too soon to invest in the Moto Z3 on the basis of its 5G promises alone. Fortunately though, Motorola says it's working to eventually bring compatibility with the mod to previous Z-series devices on Verizon's network.  The Moto Z3 is available exclusively through Verizon and costs $480 in total, or $20 per month for 24 months. While there won't be an unlocked model of the phone — the device is tied closely to the 5G mod — prospective buyers on other carriers can pick up the Moto Z3 Play, which features a less powerful processor and inferior cameras, but is exactly the same in every other respect. (Be warned, though, the 5G mod won't work with the Z3 Play.)Alternatively, you could opt for a Galaxy S8 or soon-to-be-discounted iPhone 8 or Pixel 2 and still save some money as those handsets are phased out in favor of newer models.Motorola has put together a solid budget flagship in the Moto Z3, even in spite of its modest specs and familiar design. At $480, the Z3 is a pretty good choice for users who don't want to spend top dollar on the best wares from Apple, Samsung and Google, or who wish Verizon had something comparable to the OnePlus 6.Still, the Moto Z3 feels like a half measure in too many respects — like a product pushed out as a vehicle to market 5G, rather than one that can stand on its own merits. That's not exclusively the blame of the phone's last-gen processor, which is still more than powerful enough for most users.MORE: The Best Android Phone Maker? It's Actually MotorolaEven with those internal specs, it would have been great to see Motorola stay committed to ShatterShield — a legitimate value add that no other phone maker really has an answer for — or find a way to maximize longevity on a charge, rather than simply telling users to go out and buy a mod. But the Moto Z3 carries shockingly few improvements over its predecessors, leaving it feeling like a device whose greatest feature is its low price — at least until those 5G plans materialize.Credit: Tom's Guide"
174,Android 9 Pie,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/android-9-pie,review-5653.html","Android has always been about control, offering myriad ways for users to tailor their smartphone experience to their preference, even in granular ways. But that approach often flew in the face of simplicity and ease-of-operation for newcomers, and it's given Google's mobile OS something of a reputation for having a steep learning curve, with endless distractions and an overwhelming number of options and permutations.Android 9 Pie signals a tonal shift by Google. This feels like the first version of Android explicitly designed to demand less of your time, not more — from its focus on combating digital addiction to a redesigned navigation scheme that relies on just one button to carry out an assortment of tasks.Not every change achieves its intended purpose, but the end result is a more considerate experience for the devices we use more than any other every day. Android 9 Pie takes you where you want to go faster. New gesture navigationAndroid's shift to a gesture-based navigation system has been one of Pie's headline features, and for good reason. Since Android launched nearly a decade ago, the OS has employed three to four buttons to get around — home, back, recent apps and, during the early days, search. These were hardware keys until Ice Cream Sandwich folded them into software, and now they're being pared even further, to just one on-screen button.The new home button is pill-shaped and reacts the same way to presses and holds as it did before: You tap it to go home, or linger on it to call up Google Assistant. But now, in iPhone X-style fashion, Android's home button also encompasses the Recents screen and app drawer. A short swipe up from the bottom edge reveals the former, while a longer swipe will take you to the latter.The back button now only appears on an as-needed basis, which is visually a bit strange. And rather than flipping to another app with a short swipe up, you can drag the home button left and right to scrub through previously used apps.Overall, the new system doesn't take long to grasp. It even has one really clever feature in the way it deals with screen rotation. I almost always have my phone locked in portrait orientation, which only presents a problem when I'm watching videos. Android Pie will call up a rotation button to the right of the home button when I turn my phone, even when portrait lock is on. Tap the rotation button, and the screen rotates — but only for that app. The orientation returns to portrait when I arrive back at the home screen. Neat.Overall, the new gesture controls don't take long to grasp.I really do like Android Pie's new scheme, though it may be reassuring to know that if you don't take to it, you can always fall back on the old ways by going to System > Gestures and turning off ""Swipe up on Home button.""There is one thing that bothers me about the new interface, though, and it almost negates the whole point of using gestures in place of buttons in the first place. Most Android phones that have adopted gesture controls also take the opportunity to slim down the area the navigation bar takes up, freeing  more real estate for on-screen content. For example, OnePlus' dead-simple approach has no visual representation at all, while Motorola's is a thin line similar to what you'd find on an iPhone X.MORE: 14 Biggest New Android Pie FeaturesStrangely, though, Android Pie's tack consumes just as much of the screen as the old trio of buttons did — meaning Google missed a real opportunity to deliver a more immersive full-screen experience. With smartphone displays getting progressively larger and bezels shrinking, this oversight isn't deal breaking, though it does feel somewhat unrefined.Improved Recents screenChanges to the Recents screen (or Overview, as some users call it) go hand-in-hand with Android Pie's new gestures. Unlike the vertically scrolling cards of previous Android versions, Pie adopts a right-to-left approach, with a search bar and list of suggested apps at the bottom, based on what the OS expects you'll use given your history.The upshot is a Recents screen that is considerably more versatile, and should save you some taps. Those who insist on regularly dumping their cache of apps will appreciate the presence of an ""Clear All"" button, revealed when you thumb all the way past the oldest app in your stream. And Google has smartly added copy functionality to the previews themselves, meaning you can long-press text in an app preview within the Recents screen, grab it, enter another app and paste it there.The only potentially confusing change is the method for entering multiwindow mode. In Android Pie, you press and hold the app icon above the preview and tap ""Split screen."" It's simple enough, though the OS never explains the new behavior, so it could leave some users lost, at least initially.Adaptive Brightness and BatteryGoogle has channeled the expertise of Alphabet's DeepMind AI research team, using machine learning to improve brightness management and battery life in Android. The initiative has produced two new features: Adaptive Brightness and Adaptive BatteryAdaptive Brightness may sound somewhat redundant, as smartphones have had automatic brightness since the beginning of time. However, a phone's auto-brightness feature adjusts brightness up and down based on some preset notion of what constitutes a visible display in a given condition. In contrast, Adaptive Brightness pays attention to your preferences and formulates its behavior based on that.In other words, Adaptive Brightness actually encourages you to use the brightness slider, so it can learn what you like. That's particularly valuable for users who prefer a brighter screen on average, like yours truly. After repeated changes, the OS will get better at predicting how bright you want the screen to be in certain scenarios — and I'm pleased to say, it did exactly that in my experience.My first day using Pie, Adaptive Brightness was  hit or miss. By day two, it was doing a considerably better job at guessing. On a cloudy day, I watched the luminosity ramp up as the sun briefly revealed itself — and for the first time I can remember using a smartphone on automatic brightness, I didn't feel the urge to change it.Adaptive Battery operates in a similar fashion, except it deals with the amount of energy consumed by apps, not your display. The feature monitors the software you like to use and when you use it; it then intelligently diverts background processes to the appropriate apps when you need them.MORE: Siri Is Catching Up to Alexa and Google Assistant in an Important WayJust like with brightness, it will take a bit of time before the battery tech has gathered enough information to make an informed decision about how to manage your phone's power. At the time of writing this review, I haven't noticed any major difference in battery life, though I've  been using Pie only since the beginning of the week — so it'll take a bit more time to evaluate how well the second of Google’s AI-powered additions has fared.Digital Wellbeing (Beta)Likewise, it'll take some time before we really witness the value of Google's Digital Wellbeing initiative, because this new feature remains in beta. However, anyone running Android Pie on a Pixel device can easily opt in and give it a whirl, which is what we've done for this review.The entire Digital Wellbeing suite lives inside the Settings app, and consists of three pillars: Screen Time, App Timers and Wind Down.Screen Time presents you with a snapshot of your daily usage, broken into a pie chart that lists how much of your time all your apps have consumed. The feature also lists the number of times you've unlocked your phone, as well as the number of notifications you've received.Tap into any app in the chart, and you get to drill down to view week-by-week usage. From there, you can set a time limit for the app in question, or tweak the number of notifications it sends you. That can be a bit challenging for apps that serve up a ton of alerts, like the Google app — though the freedom to silence the notifications you don't want has long been one of Android's strengths (and one that Apple is now copying with iOS 12).MORE: How to Stop Pop-Ups in Chrome in Just 5 Easy StepsI found the data offered by Screen Time interesting, but not profoundly eye-opening — and I suspect many users will feel the same. Mindfulness is always good, but I don't see myself returning to this data very often. However, it's easy to imagine parents paying close attention to the insights it provides on their kids' habits.The data offered by Android Pie's Screen Time is interesting, but not profoundly eye-opening.The more immediately useful tools are App Timers and Wind Down. Timers enforce daily limits for how long you spend in apps — when you've used it  up, the icon turns to grayscale until the cycle begins anew. Wind Down paints your display in grayscale and automatically flips on Do Not Disturb at predetermined hours when you want to discourage usage — like, say, when going to bed.MORE: iOS 12 vs. Android P: Comparing the New FeaturesAs you might have noticed, much of what Google's doing with regards to wellness is also present in iOS 12, Apple's upcoming update for iPhones. However, one interesting difference I've noticed is that Android's App Timers do a better job of preventing usage than Apple's system, because Android doesn't allow you to easily bypass a limit once you've hit it. You actually have to go into the Digital Wellbeing Dashboard and turn the timer off  to open the app again before the day is over. iOS 12 lets you override your Time Limit directly from the warning screen that you've run out of time. I imagine that difference will ultimately make Google's implementation more effective.App Actions (and What About Slices?)App Actions are like tiny commands that trigger apps, and can appear dynamically in different places around the Android UI — including search suggestions, the app drawer or even text selection.Given that so much of Android Pie hinges on predictability, the idea is that actions will pop up when the system expects you'll need them. For example, I've kept the same Spotify playlist in heavy rotation on the way home from work for the last few days, so I wasn't terribly surprised to see it appear underneath my suggested apps one afternoon. Tapping it not only took me to the playlist in question, but began playing the first song. Pretty cool.Although Actions work well with Android's built-in apps at present, third-party developers need to do some work to integrate them into their apps — so this is a feature that likely won't take off until Pie has had more time to reach users. Once that happens, we should also be getting Slices — a similar UI aspect that Google is actually still working on.  I've kept the same Spotify playlist in heavy rotation on the way home from work for the last few days. Android Pie's App Actions made it appear underneath my suggested apps.However, Slices are a lot like App Actions, but typically larger, with more interactivity and options. Whereas an App Action for Lyft might just present itself as a button to call a car, a Slice could present distances, ETAs and prices, and give you choices between a few destinations — all appearing when you type ""Lyft"" in your phone's search bar.At this point, there's no telling all the ways in which developers might use Slices, and the feature won't arrive on Android Pie until later in the fall. The potential is certainly there, but again, we'll have to wait a bit longer before we see if the developers rise to the task.Shush and Do Not DisturbDo Not Disturb has been a mainstay of Android for a while now, but it's been bolstered in Android Pie with a new feature called Shush. With Shush, you can lay your phone screen-side-down to automatically activate Do Not Disturb mode.Apple has had a somewhat similar gesture on its iPhones for a while, though it would only mute and lock your phone. Do Not Disturb is a more comprehensive solution in Android Pie because it silences all visual interruptions as well as noises.MORE: Best Android BrowsersNew Volume and Screenshot UIsRounding out Android Pie's more notable features are a pair of small interface changes that fix some of the platform's more long-standing oversights. One of the first things loyal Android users will notice is that raising or lowering volume presents a vertical slider on the right side of the phone, unlike the horizontal element in previous versions.The bigger change, though, is that pressing the volume rocker now modifies media volume by default, rather than the volume of your ringer. As anyone who has inadvertently triggered an autoplay video in a meeting can tell you that that's probably for the best. As for the ringer, there's now a single on-screen button above the slider to let you toggle among on, vibration only or  off.Android Pie's handling of screenshots also borrows one of Apple's best ideas for iOS. Now, snapping a screenshot automatically produces a link to edit it, where you can quickly crop or mark up the image before saving it to your gallery or sharing it with friends.Who Can Get Android 9 Pie?It's always a toss up as to which devices will receive the latest version of Android and when the update will be available, but there's a very good reason why Pie might be adopted more quickly than its predecessors.It's all thanks to Project Treble, Google's platform that separates core Android firmware from the front-end changes most manufacturers employ. Because of it, Google can push out updates that don't break the custom UI experiences offered by the likes of Samsung, OnePlus, LG and practically every other Android hardware maker.Project Treble is why the Essential Phone, OnePlus 6, Sony Xperia XZ2 and Nokia 7 Plus all got early support to run the Android P Beta earlier this year. And for that reason, we expect all devices included in the beta program to be among the first non-Pixel handsets to receive the public release of Android 9 Pie. (Essential actually pushed out its final software just hours after Google announced Pie availability for the Pixel and Pixel 2.)That said, even if you have a Pixel, it may take a  while before the over-the-air update reaches your device. Google typically rolls out new software  in waves over a couple of weeks, and the only way to circumvent that is to manually push the update file to your phone through the use of a PC and the Android SDK. If you'd rather not wait, we have a guide that explains how to do exactly that.Bottom LineIt's easy to say the latest version of Android is the best one. That's no disrespect to Google — rather, it's a testament to the strength of its OS. Every year, it becomes progressively more difficult to identify ways to improve the world's most popular mobile platform. And yet, Android 9 Pie represents yet another step forward.We've still got a long way to go, but we've finally reached an era when the technology we rely on is gaining respect for our time. Digital Wellbeing is a nice gesture, but this philosophy extends far beyond that, to the way in which Android Pie leverages AI to suggest apps, keeps you humming along on a charge and even helps you see your screen in less-than-favorable conditions. You often hear about the negative ways in which our data is commodified, but at least in this instance, Google is employing it to make using its smartphones less frustrating.As for things missing in Android Pie — and early suggestions for Android Q — I'd like to see Google refine its gestures, which aren't the most intuitive, nor the best for maximizing display space. Android's customizability with notifications is still unparalleled, but it can be quite overwhelming for users to wrestle with 15 toggles for all the different categories of alerts the Google app can provide. And Android Auto, once an exciting new frontier for the platform, has languished in recent years with slow animations and a bit of a head-scratching interface, while Apple's CarPlay soars.But those are nitpicks. The fact of the matter is, Android is easier to live with than ever before, but no less powerful — and that's the greatest praise one could offer it.Credit: Tom's Guide"
175,Vivo Nex S,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/vivo-nex-s,review-5633.html","One day in the not-too-distant future, all phones will look like the Vivo Nex S. But until then, the Chinese manufacturer and subsidiary of BBK Electronics — the same company that owns OnePlus — can enjoy the recognition for being the first to beat the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google to a couple of major breakthroughs in smartphone design.Like virtually every other flagship today, the Nex S has next to no bezels. But unlike those phones' manufacturers, Vivo hasn't relied on a notch to get there, nor has it relocated the fingerprint sensor to make room for more screen space. Instead, Vivo embedded the scanner right into the Nex S' 6.6-inch OLED display. That's a feature likely to appear on next year's leading smartphones in the U.S., but Vivo beat them to the punch by almost a year.For all of Vivo's innovations, though, the Nex S is not available on this side of the Pacific. And even if you were to get your hands on one, you'd find an experience not quite built for Western users, and a quirky take on Android that, love it or hate it, carries a steep learning curve. The Nex S is as rough around the edges as exotic high-end smartphones come, and yet it still leaves an indelible impression.The Nex S is actually the more premium variant of two devices that Vivo has launched in its native China and rolled out to Russia, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. The Nex S features a Snapdragon 845 processor and 8GB of RAM, while the more midrange Nex A features Snapdragon 710 silicon and 6GB of RAM. Neither device is available stateside, though the Nex S retails for about 4498 yuan, which is approximately $660.Interestingly, however, the Nex S is wired to support most GSM bands. If you're dedicated enough, you could import the Nex S and run the phone on T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket or MetroPCS. However, there's no guarantee the device will work flawlessly — your carrier is unlikely to offer too much help if it doesn't — and it may be better suited for some networks than others.Furthermore, you have to be careful which version of the Nex S you buy. While our international unit came with the Google Play store and services installed, those sold in China do not. Without that key software, you’ll only be able to download apps common in Asia. And while you could always go ahead and sideload the Play Store after the fact, certain apps still may not function as intended — and that’s something importers will need to be mindful of.Given those limitations, it might seem strange that we've decided to review the Nex S. Typically, we tend to avoid handsets that aren't officially available to U.S. buyers. However, we feel the technical advances in this case are so great — and likely to appear on increasingly more products down the line — that we chose to evaluate them. If you ultimately decide to pick up a Nex S through an online retailer that imports overseas phones, be sure to do your due diligence beforehand. And definitely don't take the plunge without looking at our dedicated buying guide first.No smartphone in recent memory, not even the iPhone X, elicits quite the reactions Vivo's latest phone does. No matter whom I showed the Nex S to, they were fascinated by the device's pop-out, front-facing camera.A motor drives the Nex S' selfie cam out of the top of the phone. So, there's no need for a notch at the top of the display, and you won't find any bezels on three of the sides. (The ""chin"" on the bottom of the phone remains a bit thicker than the rest, to house the display driver.)Your appreciation of Vivo's approach will mostly depend on how strong your distaste for notches is. If you hate what you've seen on the iPhone X, LG G7 ThinQ, OnePlus 6 and others, this will be precisely the design breakthrough you've been waiting for. If you don't mind notches, you might call Vivo's pop-out camera a shameless attempt at over-engineering a solution to a ""problem"" most people can actually live with.The pop-out camera does create concerns for durability, but Vivo assures us that the mechanism can withstand 300,000 cycles without failing. I'm more worried about what might happen if I were to drop the phone square on the housing. But in regular usage, I'm pleased to say that the system works quite well. It's reliable and reasonably fast, and I never had a single issue with the lens taking too long to deploy.What's more, the setup gives you that uninterrupted view of the top of the display that no other bezel-free phone can provide. There isn't even an earpiece to spoil the party, as the Nex S utilizes a cutting-edge conductive audio system to convey sound through the glass itself. It's a solution that, much like the camera, works surprisingly well in practice.Unfortunately, the same can't quite be said of the Nex S' built-in fingerprint sensor. The scanner does take a hair longer than conventional alternatives, but that's really not the issue. Rather, the bigger problem is that it's really finicky. A third of my attempts to unlock our unit with my thumb failed, sometimes because my placement was off and other times because I applied too much or too little pressure.In time, you'll likely get a rhythm for what the sensor is asking for, but even then, it's never an effortless experience. The orientation needs to be just so. The industry has made considerable strides, but the technology isn't quite reliable enough for prime time yet. And after using the sensor on the Nex S, I came away with a better sense of why Apple and Samsung have yet to incorporate the feature into their phones.Once you get past those buzzworthy features, there's really not much to say about the Nex S from a design standpoint. While Vivo clearly lavished a great deal of attention on the camera, fingerprint sensor and bezels, the materials and overall fit and finish feel like afterthoughts.Admittedly, the back of the Nex S pulls off a nice trick under light, reflecting rainbow spectrums beneath its glass enclosure. But from most angles, in most conditions, it's just another gray slab with a glossy, slippery feel and vertically mounted dual cameras that ape those of the iPhone X.The front of the Nex S is dominated by a 6.6-inch OLED display that delivers punchy hues and deep blacks. The vividity really enhances the lack of bezels — if this were an LCD panel, with its comparatively washed-out colors, the design would be all for naught.However, the Nex S' screen falls short of the best in the flagship class, for two reasons. First, with a peak brightness of 470 nits, it's just barely ahead of the average smartphone's 466-nit rating. While the Nex S' display doesn't look dim by any means, other devices, including the 630-nit Galaxy S9+, handily beat it.Second, Vivo opted for full HD+ resolution on the Nex S' screen, not unlike the 6.3-inch OnePlus 6. Because the Nex S' display is considerably larger than you're likely to find on any other device, though, its individual pixels can be seen much more easily. To put things into perspective, the Nex S' panel has a density of 388 pixels per inch, compared with 529 ppi on the 6.3-inch Galaxy S9+ and its higher-res 1440p screen.The lower density has a detrimental effect on text, which doesn't look quite as sharp on the Nex S as you might find on other flagships. Neither does video, as I found watching the trailer for the upcoming Venom movie. The symbiote's inky-black skin didn't glisten with the same luster on Vivo's device as it did on the Galaxy S9+.MORE: OLED Killer? Apple Has Big Plans for Micro-LED ScreensWhile the Nex S could stand to gain some pixels, what's already there doesn't disappoint. The device reproduced 250 percent of the sRGB color space in our testing, which is ever so slightly more than the OnePlus 6's 240-percent result. That translates to colors that tend to be a bit more saturated than what you'll find on other phones.In terms of color accuracy, the Nex S' panel registered a score of 0.50 in Delta-E testing, where numbers closer to zero are better. It's common to see handsets with the best displays notch a rating within the 0.20-to-0.40 range. While the Nex S falls just outside that range, it's not something you're likely to notice.You wouldn't expect much from the Nex S' cameras, given their specs. On the back, you'll find a 12-megapixel main lens with an f/1.8 aperture, assisted by a 5-MP, f/2.4 shooter for depth effects.It's a humble pairing on paper, but the results are far better than you'd expect. That's especially true of indoor and dimly lit scenes, like the example below.The Nex S more than held its own against the Google Pixel 2 XL in our first comparison, where both phones tapped their high-dynamic-range modes to deliver balanced still-life-style shots of objects on a windowsill. The Pixel's photo is a fair bit sharper, and the warmer tones of the building in the background are more realistic. However, the Nex S produced a photo that was every bit as bright, with punchier colors in the wood grain of the radio and a slightly more intense shade of red on the terra-cotta planter.Unfortunately, the Nex S was unable to follow up its impressive debut when it came to shooting in Portrait Mode. I didn't turn any face-smoothing features on, but I suspect the Nex S' built-in AI scene recognition went ahead and applied such a filter anyway. The result is a super-blurry portrait that muddies every detail of my colleague Jorge's face. Even his shirt seems out of focus, which becomes abundantly clear when you compare it to the same scene through the lens of the Pixel 2 XL.For this particular comparison, I enlisted the Huawei P20 Pro, our favorite handset for shooting  really, really dark scenes. The P20 Pro's Night Mode collects data from all three of the phone's rear lenses and keeps the exposure open for a full 4 seconds to let as much light in as possible.The Nex S can't compete with those features, but the results  in low light are admirable. This room was pitch-black, and the Nex S still pulled out a little more color and a little less noise than the P20 Pro's rendition. Of course, the image from Vivo's phone is considerably dimmer, but given how unfavorable the conditions were (not to mention how good the P20 Pro is), I'd still consider it a victory.Finally, the Nex S' pop-out 8-MP camera captured a suitably bright selfie, though it brightened the complexion of my skin in an unnatural way. Some users may be looking for that from their front-facing lenses, but if it's realism you want, the Pixel 2 XL still outshines Vivo's attempt with greater clarity and authentic colors.Thankfully, the Nex S is more than a pretty face — it's quite powerful under the hood, too. Armed with a Snapdragon 845 processor and 8GB of RAM, the Nex S is among the speediest Android phones we've tested all year, right up there alongside the OnePlus 6.This device isn't easily taxed, which became evident in daily usage as well as benchmarks. On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Nex S managed a score of 9,054, just below the 9,098 from the 8GB version of the OnePlus 6. A similar story played out in graphics performance, where the Nex S totaled 4,708 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test, almost keeping pace with OnePlus' bargain flagship, which scored 5,124.MORE: Hands On: Android P Already Beats iPhone X in BetaWhile I didn't necessarily enjoy my time with Vivo's Funtouch OS — more on that later — the user interface didn't introduce any lag in my experience, with one exception. Although split-screen performance was fine, animations played out sluggishly when I dragged the dividing line to alter the relative sizes of the windows. That's a bit unexpected for such a powerful device and something you don't encounter in most flagships, even older ones like the Pixel 2 XL.The 4,000-mAh battery inside the Nex S lasted exactly 13 hours in our testing, where the device streamed web pages endlessly over T-Mobile's LTE network until it ran out of juice.That's impressive, but there are a couple of caveats. First, it's important to remember that the Nex S supports only half of T-Mobile's frequency bands: 2, 4 and 5. Those happen to be the bands T-Mobile relies on most, and the lack of complete support could have an untold effect on battery life. Second, Vivo's aggressive power-management habits forced us to use a third-party app just to keep the screen on during page loads, which hasn't been the case with any other smartphones we've run through our test.Those asterisks aside, 13 hours is quite good for any phone. At the moment, our flagship leader in battery life is Huawei's Mate 10 Pro, which delivered 14 hours and 39 minutes with a battery that has exactly the same capacity as the one inside the Nex S. However, the Nex S needs to power a significantly larger screen, which complicates things.Vivo's Funtouch OS is built off of Android 8.1 Oreo. And, like so many custom Android front ends from Chinese phone makers, Funtouch attempts to distance itself from the traditional experience as much as possible.It's not uncommon for manufacturers to modify Google's software to make it look and feel more like iOS, but Vivo's transformation goes the furthest we've seen in a while. For example, quick toggles and the volume and brightness sliders have been moved into a panel revealed with a swipe up from the bottom, just like the iPhone's Control Center. (Vivo even calls this feature Control Center, shamelessly.)MORE: Best Chrome Apps - Top Free and Paid Apps for Your ...And that's not all. There's no app drawer, and a swipe down anywhere on the home screen takes you to a system-wide search pane. Besides the iOS similarities, Vivo has added quite a large suite of apps to Funtouch that can't be uninstalled, including a link to the company's website, as well as another app store for Indian customers in addition to the Google Play store our unit came with.You can't take Vivo to task for not preparing Funtouch for U.S. users, as the company doesn't sell products here. But it's hard to recommend a device with so many software idiosyncrasies.To give credit where it's due, the company has made an attempt to smooth things out. For example, Vivo's Chinese-language Jovi assistant was replaced with Google Assistant on our international unit, and the left button originally intended for Jovi was remapped accordingly. However, Jovi still appears in the Settings menu even though it's not technically present.There are lots of quirks like that in Funtouch — from how unnecessarily difficult Vivo makes it to use third-party launchers to the separate keyboard the system insists on using whenever you enter a password. You quickly get the feeling that Funtouch operates on a fundamentally different assumption of the way people use their phones in other parts of the world, and it doesn't really jibe with Android's reputation for customizability here. And too often, the result is frustrating.The Vivo Nex S is the kind of device you want so desperately to love, because it will actually bring about real change to smartphones. Other phone makers say their products are innovative, but the Nex S has tangible advancements that prove it.The problem is that the Nex S is groundbreaking enough to earn a spot on our collective radars, but it isn't rounded enough to recommend as a daily driver. Much of that has to do with the software, which is, at best, occasionally head-scratching and, at worst, incomplete. But even if the Nex S felt as satisfying to use as it looks, importing it is a headache, and it may not even work properly depending on your network and location.Those are tough compromises to bear, even if the Nex S' notch-less, edge-to-edge screen; nifty selfie cam; and in-display fingerprint sensor foretell the future we're tired of waiting for. The Nex S may turn heads now, but once successive generations of iPhones, Pixels and Galaxy handsets catch up to what Vivo has done here — and bring with them a certain level of polish — you have to wonder if anyone will remember the first.Credit: Tom's Guide"
176,Asus ZenFone 5Q,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/asus-zenfone-5q,review-5618.html","Say what you will about Asus' phones, but you can't criticize the company for lacking conviction. Every year, the Taiwanese tech giant releases a massive range of handsets (it launched no fewer than eight in 2017 alone) typically distinguished by a flurry of vague superlatives, including ""Deluxe,"" ""Max,"" ""Zoom"" and the ever-mysterious ""Laser.""However, 2018 could be the start of a new chapter for Asus' mobile division, as the company seems to have just three products in the pipeline for the fifth generation of ZenFones: the flagship ZenFone 5Z, the midrange ZenFone 5, and this — the entry-level, $299 ZenFone 5Q.Bearing that in mind, it seems Asus has learned a bit of restraint — a virtue that too often goes undervalued in this industry. But beneath that sheen of a snappy, new name, the ZenFone 5Q feels a lot like its predecessors. Which is to say it's pretty fast and lasts long on a charge, but it's founded upon woefully outdated software and has average cameras that don't live up to the company's grandiose claims.Long battery life: The ZenFone 5Q's generously sized 3,300-mAh battery lasted 10 hours and 59 minutes on our test, where the device streamed websites until it ran out of juice. That's better than the 9:48 smartphone average, and not too far off from the $229 Asus ZenFone Max Plus' 11:25 runtime.In fact, the ZenFone 5Q outperformed the Nokia 6.1 by 35 minutes and the Moto G6 by an hour and a half. There are budget handsets that will last longer, but usually not without concessions to performance.Modern design: After producing a string of uninspired, cookie-cutter smartphones, Asus appears to have updated its template. The ZenFone 5Q isn't an eye-catching device by any means, but it's inoffensive and gets the job done. And unlike the company's previous efforts, it looks like a handset from this generation, with a large 18:9 display, respectably sized bezels and a mirrored glass back atop a sturdy polycarbonate frame.The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is a smidge high and has a small diameter, but it unlocks quickly. The ZenFone 5Q doesn't approach the Goldilocks size and shape of the $249 Moto G6, but like Motorola's popular budget offering, it has NFC for Google Pay transactions as well as a headphone jack.Bright, 6-inch screen: So long as you're not expecting the vividity of a flagship display, the ZenFone 5Q's 6-inch, full-HD LCD screen compares solidly with those of rival devices, offering correct color reproduction, a wide gamut of hues and one of the brighter backlights we've seen in this category.The ZenFone 5Q topped out at exactly 500 nits when we measured the display's peak brightness with our light meter. That's even better than other leaders in the sub-$300 segment, such as the $269 Nokia 6.1 (450 nits) and the Moto G6 (413 nits), and makes the ZenFone 5Q quite comfortable to use outdoors.Asus' panel also notched a Delta-E result of 0.39, indicating accurate calibration. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) In terms of color range, the ZenFone 5Q's 137-percent swath of the sRGB color space was in between Motorola's (113) and Nokia's (142) best efforts.Solid midrange performance: The ZenFone 5Q utilizes the same Snapdragon 630 chip found in the Nokia 6.1, but it combines it with 4GB of RAM rather than 3GB.That's the best pairing of processor and memory you're likely to find for $300 or less, and it also makes the ZenFone 5Q one of the smoothest-performing handsets in its class. The extra gigabyte of RAM lends confidence to multitasking, and we like that Asus phone includes 64GB of built-in storage, which is more akin to what you get on a base-model iPhone 8 or Galaxy S9.In Geekbench 4, a benchmark that measures overall performance, the ZenFone 5Q turned in a score of 4,108 — some 400 points higher than the Nokia 6.1, and functionally on a par with the Moto G6's 4,122.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesThe ZenFone 5Q also impressed in 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test, a graphics benchmark we use for midrange and low-end devices. There, Asus' handset totaled a very respectable 16,607, which is slightly behind the Nokia 6.1's 16,847. That's adequate enough to play some higher-end games like PUBG Mobile on moderate settings, which isn't too shabby for a $300 device.micro USB in 2018: The ZenFone 5Q supports micro USB instead of the newer, faster USB Type-C format and, as a result, doesn't feature rapid charging. That means it takes quite a while to top up that big battery with the included adapter. In a half hour, the device reached just 34 percent in our testing.And good luck if you plan on using a third-party charger you might have lying around. The ZenFone 5Q took 3 whole hours to go from empty to full with an old Sony micro USB charger I still had from my days of using an Xperia XZ2 Compact.The other issue with having such an old port is that newer accessories won't work with it. That's going to be a problem if you happen to have a pair of USB-C headphones you really like, for example.  Meh cameras: Much like HTC did with its U12+, Asus has opted for dual cameras on both the front and rear of the ZenFone 5Q. Unfortunately, though, more lenses don't always lead to better photos.On the back, there's a primary 16-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 lens mated to an 8-MP, f/2.4 wide-angle camera for landscapes and Portrait Mode. The front has an even sharper 20-MP sensor with a larger f/2.0 aperture, but it's paired with the same 8-MP secondary sensor and its wider field of view.The inclusion of wide-angle lenses on the front and back makes the ZenFone 5Q suitable for capturing the full scale of your surroundings as well as snapping a group selfie. But the phone's cameras produce mixed results, with blown-out highlights, dim exposure and blurry details the farther you zoom in.The picturesque scene above, taken at a racetrack on a perfect summer day, exemplifies the ZenFone 5Q's strengths as well as its shortcomings. Asus' offering is sharper than that of the Nokia 6.1, with more detail preserved in the shadowy trees to the left. However, things get considerably fuzzier in the distance, and there's significant distortion around the perimeter of the frame that Nokia's rendition avoids. Plus, the ZenFone 5Q paints a noisy, grainy, gray sky, and strangely, the greens are a little too warm for what the situation called for.Portraits weren't the ZenFone 5Q's bag, either, as evidenced by the dark example above. Some users may appreciate the addition of a Portrait Mode, but Asus' implementation is incapable of accurately separating the foreground from the background. The smoothing is overly aggressive too, lending the effect of a bad Photoshop job.Before we get into the results from the front-facing cameras, you should know that Asus is very, very serious about selfies. The ZenFone 5Q even includes an app called Selfie Master, which offers an assortment of dials to slim your cheeks, enlarge your eyes and, rather problematically, whiten your skin. I struggled to get Selfie Master to make me look like anything other than an alien, so I switched it off.In doing so, I found that, much like its rear cameras, the ZenFone 5Q's front cameras favor dramatic contrast and boosted hues. There's no question Asus' shooters do more with indoor lighting in the example above; it's surprisingly well exposed. But the lighting is a bit uneven and looks unnatural, and the color of my hair is way too light. If you prefer more stylized selfies, though, you may like what you see.Dated Android OS: We're coming up on the anniversary of Android 8.0 Oreo's debut last year, and yet the ZenFone 5Q makes do with Android 7.1.1 Nougat. That's indefensible, but perhaps it wouldn't sting quite as much if Asus' ZenUI skin weren't the mess that it is.ZenUI trades on every bad habit of Android phone makers desperate to differentiate their products with flimsy extra features and gaudy animations at the expense of sensible design. Take, for example, the phone's Boost function, which frees up memory to improve performance. It's a glorified ""clear all"" button, which Android really doesn't need because it's pretty good at managing resources on its own.That's not unusual among third-party Android front ends. But then Asus went ahead and added another, even more aggressive Super Boost mode that actively prevents background processes of any kind on a wide swath of apps by default — including ones you may actually need to run discreetly, like Chrome.It's pretty irresponsible to encourage users to switch on a mode that stops software from working properly, and yet Asus went ahead and did it anyway. There's also an optional High Performance profile (for those special occasions when you want your phone to be fast) and a flurry of obtuse behaviors, like brightness that constantly changes depending on what's on-screen, and a read-it-later app called Page Marker that gobbles up articles and spits them out in unintelligible CSS.MORE: Best Android Phones - Top Rated Smartphones You Can Buy ...Should the 5Q eventually see that sorely needed Oreo update that Asus has teased for later in the year, it would be refreshing to see the bloat scaled back.The ZenFone 5Q retails for $299 and comes in one hardware configuration with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Two colors are on offer: black (which is really more of a dark indigo) and white. The rest of the world gets a red variant, but that one is skipping the United States. The ZenFone 5Q works on GSM networks like those of AT&T and T-Mobile, but you can't use it on CDMA networks like Sprint's and Verizon's.With the ZenFone 5Q, Asus has produced yet another reasonable proposition for budget buyers, with speedy performance for the price and a long-lasting (albeit slow-charging) battery. And once again, it's hampered by a laundry list of features that look good on paper but mean almost nothing in the real world.The photography suite sounds enticing, with its four lenses, wide-angle perspectives and plethora of shooting modes, but the photos don't look noticeably better than the competition's. Even worse, the ZenFone 5Q continues Asus' disregard for software. Android Nougat is ancient, and ZenUI only makes things worse.For all the ways the ZenFone 5Q tries to grab your attention, it's really just a fine budget phone. But it's not very polished, nor is it the cheapest, nor does it work on the widest selection of networks. And that makes it hard to recommend in light of more well-rounded options like the Moto G6, Nokia 6.1 or even the Honor 7X.Credit: Tom's Guide"
177,Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-xperia-xz2-premium,review-5606.html","Lukewarm smartphone sales aside, Sony has finally set about reinventing its handsets. Recent Xperia XZ2 releases have introduced a fresh design philosophy that differentiates the company's efforts from those of its Android rivals. Lately, we've been seeing some of the most exciting products to bear the Xperia name in a long time.That brings us to the newest entry in this year's batch of range-topping Sony phones — the Xperia XZ2 Premium. At $999, you'd hope the XZ2 Premium would boast a few advantages over the $799 Xperia XZ2 and the $649 XZ2 Compact. And those advantages come in the form of an ultra-high-definition display and the first rear-facing dual-camera system the company has ever shipped.Those are big additions — but then, they should be, because at $999, this is iPhone X money we're talking about. For anyone excited by the prospect of watching and recording 4K HDR video, the XZ2 Premium may justify that princely sum. But for the rest of us? Sony's effort is wrought with quirks and contradictions that betray its ""premium"" name.The Xperia XZ2 Premium begins shipping July 30 for $999 in only one configuration, with 64GB of internal storage and 6GB of RAM. There are two colors on offer — Chrome Silver and Chrome Black — and the phone comes GSM unlocked, so it will work on networks like T-Mobile, AT&T, MetroPCS and Cricket. You can't use it on CDMA networks like Sprint or Verizon.There are perks for preordering, too. Sony is throwing in a pair of its Xperia Ear Duo wireless earbuds with the purchase of every XZ2 Premium before July 30. The Ear Duo is a bit unusual among Bluetooth headphones, as it is designed to invite ambient noise in while playing audio clearly. The accessory normally goes for $279 on its own.Figuratively speaking, the Xperia XZ2 Premium is a phone stuck between times — a confluence of Sony's penchant for stoic, imposing handsets and the company's newfound ambition to follow market trends toward smaller bezels and more curvaceous forms.Literally speaking, it's a shiny brick, and it weighs a ton.The weight is the very first thing you notice when you pick up the Xperia XZ2 Premium. At 8.3 ounces, the device tips the scales at an ounce heavier than the iPhone 8 Plus. It's also significantly thicker, with a domed back panel crafted from Gorilla Glass 5 that arguably makes Sony's big handset easier to hold in one hand than Apple's, but at the expense of an extra two-tenths of an inch in its profile.With that curve, the stereo front-facing speakers and the glossy aluminum frame, the XZ2 Premium feels a lot like a larger version of the existing XZ2. Unfortunately, that's more of a curse than a blessing.I'm willing to concede a bit of the extra plumpness on the diminutive XZ2 Compact, but the XZ2 Premium has a reasonably tall and very wide footprint, with a 16:9 display (owing to Sony's commitment to 4K content on this particular device) and chunky bezels. In this age of narrower phones, the XZ2 Premium evokes a phablet from years gone by. It's too bulky in every dimension.To make matters worse, Sony's fingerprint sensor woes continue with the XZ2 Premium. The scanner has once again been placed near the center of the backside on this model, just as it was on the regular XZ2. It was a terrible idea then, and it's a terrible idea now. My index finger naturally gravitates toward the cameras, so it takes a frustrating effort of dexterity just to curl my finger downward to hit the sensor without dropping the phone. ""Uncomfortable"" barely begins to describe it.MORE: A Guide to No Contract and Prepaid Phone PlansAt least a few of the other XZ2 devices' design positives — like IP68 water resistance, Qi wireless charging and dedicated camera shutter button — have been retained for the XZ2 Premium. There's no 3.5-millimeter audio jack, however, so you'll have to rely on the included USB Type-C adapter to use conventional headphones.The 5.8-inch, 3840 x 2160 LCD display on the Xperia XZ2 Premium may not seem very big on paper when more than a few phones from Sony's competitors have crossed the 6-inch threshold. But remember: This is a 16:9 panel, rather than an 18:9 one — so it appears larger in person than the numbers indicate.  However, the XZ2 Premium's screen doesn't make efficient use of that real estate. The displays on the iPhone X, Galaxy S9 and OnePlus 6 nudge right up against the edge. It's a magical feat of engineering when phone makers cram ginormous panels into relatively compact bodies, but unfortunately, Sony couldn't pull off the same trick here.Regardless, this is the sharpest display you'll find on any handset. At a staggering 760 pixels per inch, it even wipes the floor with the 570-ppi Galaxy S9. Truthfully, you don't notice it so much in regular usage, but that changes the moment you fire up a 4K film.As I watched the trailer for the upcoming Predator reboot, I was impressed with the XZ2 Premium's ability to deftly capture the light glinting off the titular villain's armor, the intricate beads of rain and the intensity of the gunfire. These are the kinds of barely perceptible details that stand out with a bump in resolution; in such moments, Sony's device truly delivers every bit of the premium experience its name suggests.It's somewhat disappointing, then, that for all the XZ2 Premium display's crispness, it's still outshone in other ways by OLED panels like those in Samsung's leading handsets.While the XZ2 Premium nails those fine gradations of color and excellent contrast in dim scenes thanks to the display's HDR support, even the best LCD panels serve up washed-out blacks compared to their OLED counterparts, simply because those pixels remain lit even when they don't need to be.  A more surprising issue with the XZ2 Premium's display is that it just isn't as bright as we've come to expect for modern smartphones. The phone peaked at 442 nits, which is just below the 466-nit average among handsets. Colors appeared realistic in the default Standard profile, where the XZ2 Premium covered 129 percent of the sRGB color space and notched a Delta-E color-accuracy score of 0.43. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.)MORE: The Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesStill, display aficionados will appreciate the level of control Sony gives users to customize the color profile to their liking. There are RGB and Super Vivid modes to satisfy both ends of the spectrum, and HDR for video can be activated at will. For what it's worth, the default profile favors a slightly cooler white balance, especially compared to the Galaxy S9+ on AMOLED Cinema mode. However, this too can be altered with an array of sliders.Besides its 4K display, the Xperia XZ2 Premium's other standout features center on photography. The phone's dual rear cameras are the first of their kind from Sony, and they're unlike any we've seen before.The XZ2 Premium pairs a 19-megapixel, f/1.8 main sensor with a 12-megapixel, f/1.6 monochrome secondary shooter. The former does the heavy lifting in most scenarios, while the latter picks up the slack when things get dim.Now, using a monochrome sensor strictly to capture luminosity is nothing new; the Huawei P20 Pro, Moto Z2 Force and even the oft-maligned Essential Phone all take a similar tack. What makes the XZ2 Premium unique is its superhigh ISO: 51,200 for photos and a smartphone-leading 12,800 for video. The device can even record in 4K resolution with high dynamic range.For all the attention Sony has given low-light superiority, it's encouraging to know the XZ2 Premium can still impress in the sun. Those who lean toward warmer, boosted hues will likely favor the iPhone X's rendition of this picturesque late-afternoon summer scene. But the XZ2 Premium's effort is more balanced and realistic, not to mention noticeably brighter within the shadows.On the flip side, the iPhone X turned in a much more satisfying shot of a row of kayaks on the banks of a creek. While the XZ2 Premium nails the finer details, like the scrapes and scratches on the boats, there's no question that the fiery reds and calming blues are conveyed better on Apple's device. Unlike the Xperia, the iPhone X also managed to avoid blowing out the highlights in the background.When night fell, it was time to find out whether Sony's kitchen-sink approach to low-light photography actually yielded results. For these comparisons, we pitted the XZ2 Premium against the Galaxy S9+, one of our favorite mobile cameras for shooting in the dark.As it turns out, the Xperia can more than hold its own against Samsung's flagship shooter, even in the trickiest of photo ops. The XZ2 Premium actually delivered a better-exposed shot in the example above, though the ISO sensitivity may have done more harm than good, leading to a noisier, oversharpened portrait.Speaking of portraits, this seems like as good a time as any to point out that the XZ2 Premium isn't launching with a bokeh-effect Portrait mode (though we're told it will arrive in an update before the end of the year). It's baffling that Sony finally went to the trouble of producing a dual-camera phone years after its competitors, only to fail to include the one feature that customers actually seek out dual-camera phones for.When we moved on to a scene of a neon-bathed street corner, the Galaxy S9+ again edged out the XZ2 Premium, with slightly better color and definition in the murkier areas of the trees and the building to the left. That said, the difference is negligible — both phones are fantastically well matched in low light.Given how admirably the XZ2 Premium performed in stills, we weren't surprised to find the handset excel in video — especially with the help of Sony's Ultra High Sensitivity mode. This feature leverages the monochrome lens to improve videos in much the same way it enhances stills. Using it prevents 4K HDR recording, but it's preferred in nighttime scenarios like the one above. Ultimately, the setting helped the XZ2 Premium capture a clip that was sharper, and yet somehow less grainy, than the Galaxy's best effort.There's a lot less going on with the XZ2 Premium's 13-megapixel selfie cam, but at the very least, we're pleased to report that it's leagues better than that blurry 5-MP offering in the other two XZ2 variants. That said, this front-facing lens still aggressively smooths over too much compared with the one found in Samsung's flagships.Armed with a Snapdragon 845 processor and 6GB of RAM, the Xperia XZ2 Premium matches the specs of the Galaxy S9+ and the base model of the OnePlus 6.Implementing the latest high-end Qualcomm silicon is table stakes for any Android flagship, especially one this expensive. You can rest assured that the XZ2 Premium is very snappy in day-to-day use, even in ways you might not expect. For example, I've noticed Sony sped up most of Android's animations, including app opening and screen rotation. This isn't rocket science — you can do the same with any Android phone via the Developer Options menu. But the fact that's it's been made the default behavior is a light touch that goes a long way.When it came to benchmarks, the XZ2 Premium proved consistent with leading Android handsets, and wasn't noticeably faster than the $799 Xperia XZ2. In Geekbench 4, a test that measures overall system performance, the Premium model mustered 8,465. That's in the same realm as the score from the Galaxy S9+, but 800 less than the mark from the 8GB variant of the OnePlus 6 — a phone that's $430 cheaper than Sony's latest handset and even comes with double the internal storage.Thankfully, graphics performance struck a bit closer to the target. There, the XZ2 Premium registered 4,713 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test. That's a few points higher than the 4,634 from the Galaxy S9+ and not too far behind the OnePlus 6's 5,124.MORE: 5 Ways to Speed Up Your Android Phone in Under 5 MinutesAs fast as the XZ2 Premium is, it's a tad disconcerting that it can technically be outpaced by a device that costs nearly half its price. And that's to say nothing of the elephant in the room: Apple's mighty A11 Bionic-powered iPhones, which continue to run laps around the best efforts Android manufacturers can churn out. Take the iPhone 8 Plus, which hit 10,472 in Geekbench 4. The same chip topped out at 10,354 in the iPhone X, and that's the kind of performance that's more befitting of a $1,000 phone.Big 4K displays are nice to look at, but the downside is that they draw a lot of power. It's fortunate, then, that Sony took the opportunity to increase the size of the XZ2 Premium's battery to 3,540 mAh, whereas the XZ2 made do with a 3,140-mAh power pack.Yet something appears to be amiss. Because even with that larger battery, the XZ2 Premium mustered only 9 hours and 29 minutes of streaming web pages over T-Mobile's LTE network. That's more than 2 hours less than the $799 XZ2 managed and 19 minutes below the smartphone average.We ran our battery test again just to rule out any contingencies, and the phone actually performed worse by about 20 minutes. Lackluster longevity aside, at least the XZ2 Premium supports Qi induction pads for wireless charging and Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 protocol. There’s also Sony's suite of battery-prolonging software, including the power-saving Stamina Mode, Battery Care and Qnovo Adaptive Charging.Battery Care limits the amount of time the phone is fully charged, to prevent unnecessary stress while the device is plugged in. It monitors your charging habits and only tops off the final 10 percent of the battery right before it expects you to unplug it. Qnovo Adaptive Charging works more discreetly, adjusting power-delivery levels to prevent spikes that could damage the battery's life span.As with the rest of Sony's flagship range, you can expect the latest version of Android — 8.1 Oreo — along with the company's typical suite of apps, on board the XZ2 Premium.An update to Android P should follow later in the year, which we're eagerly anticipating because Sony's custom UI has been looking a little long in the tooth for a few years now. It's been mostly unchanged since the days of Lollipop, and Android is on the brink of a major overhaul with gesture controls and greater emphasis on predictive features, so the future looks bright.Sony's 3D Creator app returns on the XZ2 Premium, allowing you to make printable models of everyday objects — even your friends' faces — by turning the phone's camera into a 3D scanner. There's the questionably useful Xperia Lounge, which surfaces apps and media handpicked by Sony, and some redundant system apps for things like the gallery and music player. Amazon also has solid representation out of the box, with its Shopping, Kindle and Prime Video apps all preloaded onto the device.In other words, the XZ2 Premium brings very little in the way of new software experiences. The most notable addition would have to be Dynamic Vibration, a feature that syncs up the phone's oversize vibration motor to sounds coming through the speakers or a pair of headphones.MORE: 10 Reasons Android Beats the iPhoneDynamic Vibration first launched on the regular XZ2 and has seemingly undergone no changes for the Premium variant. That's unfortunate, because the fidelity of the feedback is still lacking. This isn't like the slight kickback you get from a solid-state MacBook trackpad or the feeling of ice cubes rattling when shaking a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con. The XZ2 Premium's vibration resembles that vague buzz you get from any phone, only more. Truthfully, it adds nothing to the immersion of watching media on the go. Fortunately, you can turn it off right from the volume slider.Between its ultrasharp display and state-of-the-art dual cameras, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium represents the best of Sony's mobile technologies realized in one package. And yet, in far too many ways, it still feels like a flagship from the past.True, it has a 4K HDR screen. But the industry is headed toward an OLED future, and the XZ2 Premium's panel still relies on an LCD screen that isn't even very bright. Yeah, it's got two cameras capable of astronomically high ISO for a phone, but in practice, the shots and videos it captures aren't noticeably better than the competition's.All of this would be peachy in a $700, or perhaps even $800, device, but Sony is asking a grand for the XZ2 Premium. And when you're demanding that kind of investment from your customers, there's no wiggle room for being as good as the rest. You have to lead the pack, and the XZ2 Premium isn't a leader.The outlook gets even more dismal once you see past the device's hallmark features and consider the bigger picture. The ""premium"" Xperia was no faster than the XZ2 or the XZ2 Compact in our benchmark tests, or other handsets that cost hundreds less. The Premium's design is staid and uncomfortably bulky, the battery life isn't anything special, and the phone comes with just 64GB of storage. And despite all the attention lavished on those cameras, Sony is still ironing out the kinks in its Portrait Mode, while Apple, Samsung and Google have perfected theirs.A premium product should inspire customers, inform its successors and do something its competitors can't — and none of that describes the XZ2 Premium. If this is the finest phone Sony can build when the chips are down, perhaps its definition of the word isn't what it ought to be.Credit: Tom's Guide"
178,Alcatel 3V,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/alcatel-3v,review-5595.html","Affordable Android phones have embraced flagship features, such as dual-lens front-facing and rear cameras, edge-to-edge displays with 18:9 aspect ratios and biometric sensors. But even a cheap phone that doesn't look outdated can't necessarily keep pace with even midrange models.The $150 Alcatel 3V is proof that sometimes you need to shell out a little more cash to get a phone worth the money you're spending, because even $150 is too much to throw away on a phone this bad.Besides its low price tag, Alcatel's 3V has a few good points, though they come with their share of caveats.Design: Among budget phones, Alcatel's 3V is one of the better-looking models around — at least when you see it from the back. A glossy, black plastic coats the rear of the device, disrupted only by the silver trim that surrounds the vertically stacked dual-lens camera and fingerprint sensor.At first glance, the 3V could almost be mistaken for a pricier flagship phone — in fact, a few of my friends commented on its design when I took the 3V out to do some camera tests on a Brooklyn rooftop. Beneath the sensor on the back is a small, light-gray Alcatel logo. The effect is, dare I say, elegant, at least until the fingerprints start piling up on the high-shine coating.Display: Like other budget phones with large LCD panels, the 3V is a sufficiently bright phone that doesn't achieve the color accuracy or richness of more-expensive Android flagships that have OLED displays. Streaming a preview for The Meg, I was struck by how the darker deep-ocean scenes looked indistinct and almost muddy compared to the rich blacks you get with an OLED display.Alcatel's budget handset reached a peak brightness of 443 nits on our light meter, just shy of the 466-nit smartphone average, though not too shabby. This phone's screen was easily viewable in bright sunlight, and film trailers with plenty of daylight action looked great on the 3V's sizeable 6-inch display.Like other budget phones, including Blu’s R2 Plus and the Moto G6, the 3V had a respectable showing on the sRGB color gamut (116.3 percent for the 3V) and Delta-E test (0.46). Numbers closer to 0 are more accurate. This phone doesn't have the most dazzling display, but everything looks good enough.Software: Alcatel's Android skin is inoffensive, if outdated. The 3V runs Android Oreo 8.0 and offers both a split-screen app view and face unlocking features. But everything runs so slowly that using split screen is an exercise in frustration. (More on performance in a bit.)Of course, there's no guarantee that Alcatel will update the 3V to Android P this year, or ever. Given the company's track record and this phone's budget status, we're betting that the 3V will get left behind when the latest version of Android officially rolls out later this year.Where to begin?Performance: Alcatel pairs a MediaTek 8735A processor with 2GB of RAM, which tells you all you need to know about how this phone performs. The 3V reached 1,834 on the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance, which is, frankly, awful — even for a sub-$200 handset. Blu's $129 R2 Plus also features a MediaTek CPU but adds an extra 1GB of RAM. That phone trounced the 3V, with only a mediocre score of 2,319. Last year's $229 Moto G5 Plus hit 3,746, and the Moto G6 hit 3,934, proving that it's tough to beat the performance of Motorola's budget lineup.The 3V handled graphics slightly better than system tasks, scoring 6,642 on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark (a graphics performance test we use for phones in this class). The R2 Plus fell short, with a score of 5,724, while the Moto G5 Plus (13,862) and G6 (12,616) blew their budget rivals away.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesThe 3V's performance is so terrible that I installed PUBG Mobile to see how the device handled the game's graphics, and I couldn't even get the game to open. I was stuck on a loading screen for several minutes, then just gave up.Cameras: Good news: Even this sub-$200 smartphone boasts dual rear cameras. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for in photo quality.The 3V's 12-megapixel and 2-MP rear-facing lenses enable a bokeh effect, which blurs the background of an image and brings the subject into focus. In theory, this would make your 3V photos look like what you get from an iPhone. In reality, the 3V's bokeh mode makes your images look like something you tried and failed to do yourself with the blur tool in Photoshop.I used the 3V to shoot the perfect Instagram: a glass of rosé in front of the downtown Brooklyn skyline on a rooftop at sunset. It should've been gold. Instead, part of the glass's rim and the edges of my hand were unevenly blurred into the background, too. I couldn't share the picture to my social networks — what a waste.Without the bokeh effect enabled, the 3V's rear cameras fare well in natural light. In an image I captured of the Bryant Park fountain ringed by contemporary ballet dancers with Midtown Manhattan's skyscrapers in the background, the photo's lighting wasn't true-to-life, but it did create a dramatic shot.The 5-MP, front-facing lens takes average selfies, with a beauty mode to smooth out any bumps or blemishes. I dislike these beauty modes, because they make my skin look like an alien's, but some people love them.Battery life: Despite its sizable, 3,000-mAh battery, the 3V lasted just 7 hours and 16 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over T-Mobile's 4G LTE network. The smartphone average is 9:48, and that 2-hour-plus gap is absurdly abysmal.Not only does the 3V die more rapidly than other phones — even budget rivals such as Blu's $129 R2 Plus, which lasted a paltry 7:56 — it also takes forever to juice back up when plugged in to Alcatel's charging brick. After an hour of charging, the 3V's battery was still at just 30 percent.MORE: Cellphone Carriers: Best and Worst Customer ServiceOverall feel: While we liked some elements of the 3V's design, looks can be deceiving. Whenever I picked up the phone, I was struck by how cheap it felt. The plastic is incredibly lightweight, but not in a good way. The 3V's face is generic, with no distinctive markings or logos to brand the device. The 6-inch display doesn't extend all the way to the edges, so there's no reason for the bezels to be as thick as they are.The Alcatel 3V is available unlocked on Amazon for $150 with 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. It comes in one color, Spectrum Black. The device works on GSM networks and is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile in the U.S. You can't use it on CDMA networks like Sprint's and Verizon's.Budget phones are improving by leaps and bounds every year, but you still need to be wary of phones with especially low prices. Like too many other sub-$150 phones, the Alcatel 3V suffers from terrible performance and paltry battery life. Though they may have some flagship features, such as dual-lens cameras and face-unlocking, these cheap phones don't offer a premium experience.Instead, snag a $249 Moto G6, a $269 Nokia 6.1 or a $199 Honor 7X, which are all packed with great features and cost just a smidge more than Alcatel's affordable but skippable 3V.Credit: Tom's Guide"
179,OnePlus 6,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/oneplus-6,review-5438.html","The OnePlus 6 is like a certain NBA team whose return trip to the Finals is guaranteed just by bringing back the same players. It was a pretty safe bet that as long as OnePlus made the requisite annual updates, like improving the device's processor and dual cameras, the OnePlus 6 (starting at $529) would be another hit.Sure enough, OnePlus has defined this year's flagship killer, with all the performance and features you could possibly want from any smartphone, rolled into a package that costs hundreds less than top-tier offerings from Apple, Samsung and Google. And while the company's value-for-money trick might not be as surprising or special the fifth time around, cash-strapped buyers can't argue with the results.Update July 2: OnePlus will be offering a red version of the OnePlus for $579 that includes 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. It goes on sale July 10.The OnePlus 6 begins shipping on May 22, and you can preorder it now direct from the company. The base variant, priced at $529 and clad in a Mirror Black finish, is $30 more expensive than the cheapest OnePlus 5T was, but comes with the same 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.Coughing up an extra $40 will grant you 8GB of RAM and double the space for media and apps. This configuration is available in the same guise as the cheaper one, as well as a matte-like Midnight Black and, as of June 5, a special edition Silk White colorway finished off with a hint of rose gold. Finally, topping the food chain is a variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, exclusively sold in Midnight Black and going for $629.Like its predecessors, every OnePlus 6 is unlocked and compatible with GSM networks, including AT&T and T-Mobile. And if you're toying with picking one up yourself, a word to the wise: OnePlus makes limited quantities of all its phones, and it sells just one model at a time. Although the company has assured us it is building more of the OnePlus 6 than it did the 5T, that phone was discontinued after just five months — so don't say we didn't warn you. After several years of fitting its handsets with aluminum, OnePlus has transitioned to Gorilla Glass 5 all around with the OnePlus 6. Skeptics might fear a step backward in durability, but OnePlus says it has lavished the same attention on these glass backs as it had with the metal on any previous OnePlus device, and the effort shows.In fact, the company specially treated each glass on each colorway independently, to emulate different materials. For example, our Mirror Black model evokes the depth and reflectivity of polished ceramic, while the Midnight Black version approaches the matte sheen of the OnePlus 5 or 5T. OnePlus' designers actually perforated the surface of the glass on the latter model with imperceptible holes to reveal the layer of film beneath.The attention to detail is definitely appreciated, especially for such a relatively inexpensive handset. And because this is a OnePlus device, the thoughtful touches don't stop there. The company's handy Alert Slider returns on the OnePlus 6, though it's migrated from the left to the right edge since we last saw it. Better yet, users clutching onto their trusty wired headphones can breathe a sigh of relief, as the headphone jack has been miraculously spared.However, OnePlus could go only so far working with glass. The OnePlus 6 lacks the heft or density of metal, nor does it feel quite as solid as the 5T. And despite no longer employing metal, OnePlus hasn't used that opportunity to enable wireless charging, a feature that has cropped up on a growing number of flagship phones over the past year. True water resistance also remains absent from OnePlus' devices.The other major design change pertains to the OnePlus 6's notch, an element OnePlus publicized itself when it confirmed the notch's existence back in March. While I'm personally indifferent to this year's defining phone trend, I like that OnePlus owned up to it instead of playing it down. And truthfully, I didn't find it terribly obtrusive after spending a week with the phone. But if you remain vehemently opposed to a feature that is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid, there's a setting that hides the notch by painting the status bar black.My biggest gripe about the OnePlus 6's design actually does pertain to the notch, but only tangentially. Many phone makers have defended the notch because it increases usable screen space. In theory, this should allow for smaller devices with larger displays, much like the shift to 18:9 displays did. The LG G7 ThinQ, for example, shoehorns a massive 6.1-inch panel within a relatively compact footprint because it combines a notch with minimal bezels. This gives the user a ton of room to work with, while simultaneously making the whole thing easier to hold.The 6.28-inch OnePlus 6, on the other hand, sports almost exactly the same dimensions as the notch-less 5T. The result is a handset with a screen that is much larger than it needs to be, and a device that I reckon many users will find clumsy, if not impossible, to cradle one-handed. Slap one of OnePlus' fine cases on the OnePlus 6, and it becomes just as tall and a bit wider than Samsung's 6.3-inch Galaxy Note 8. Those drawn to the OnePlus 6 for its no-compromise approach to features may find themselves compromising quite a bit when it comes to ergonomics.Of all the qualities that makes the OnePlus 6 remarkable for its price, its 6.28-inch AMOLED display might be the most compelling. This is a gorgeous panel eclipsed only by those in Samsung's latest flagships, which offer better brightness and pixel density. But the gap isn't as wide as you might assume.To put what OnePlus has achieved into perspective, most phones at the $500 level, like the Honor View 10, the Essential Phone and the upcoming Asus ZenFone 5Z, come equipped with LCD screens. They tend to get the job done, but they're never anything special. The same can be said for even pricier devices like the LG G7 ThinQ and Sony Xperia XZ2, which are on the bleeding edge of LCD technology with HDR support and even more radiant backlighting.Sat next to the OnePlus 6, any of those LCD handsets appear a generation behind. Darker scenes approximate a pastiche of grays on these phones, when they should be black. Hues that should look juicy and saturated are hazy and washed out. And if  you think the OnePlus 6's representation of your favorite movie plays up the color a little too strongly, you can change the display profile to a more realistic sRGB or DCI-P3 palette.The OnePlus 6 delivered a peak full-screen brightness of 574 nits when measured with our light meter, which is dead even with the iPhone X and not far off the Galaxy S9's 603 nits. It's also a vast improvement over the 394 nits we measured last year on the OnePlus 5T.Regarding color reproduction, the OnePlus 6 registered a 240.3 color gamut within the sRGB spectrum, which is actually more than the Galaxy S9 at 220 percent — though those results will differ significantly if you opt for one of the alternate color profiles.The OnePlus 6's display proved to be not only vivid but properly calibrated, with a Delta-E accuracy score of 0.39 (numbers closer to zero are better). Again, this was identical to the Galaxy S9, which notched a 0.40 result.Like OnePlus' previous phone, the OnePlus 6 relies on a pairing of 16- and 20-megapixel lenses at the back to handle photos. Both cameras have a wide f/1.7 aperture, and employ the same wide-view angle. That means you don't get the benefit of a telephoto perspective or optical zoom on that secondary lens like you do on either the iPhone X or the Galaxy S9+. But on the plus side, low-light performance should be better than it was on previous OnePlus phones, thanks to that larger aperture.In fact, the two major improvements OnePlus made to its camera system were specifically designed to capture better shots in dim scenarios. The main 16-MP shooter is now equipped with optical-image stabilization, which will help mitigate blur when the camera needs to slow down the shutter speed to let more light in. The new primary image sensor is also 19 percent larger than that of the OnePlus 5T.Additionally, OnePlus has leveraged the power of Qualcomm's Spectra 280 image signal processor to enable super slow-motion video at 480 frames per second (fps) and 720p resolution. While that's half as slow as the Galaxy S9's 960 fps mode, on the OnePlus 6 you can record for up to a minute. The Galaxy S9 can  capture only 960 fps in very short bursts, like 1.2 seconds, played back in real time over a 6-second clip.On a dreary morning in New York City, the OnePlus 6 delivered a balanced shot with strong contrast that compared favorably to what the Pixel 2 XL mustered. When you zoom in, however, Google's phone begins to show why it's our favorite for photography. The Pixel 2 XL exhibits more realistic greens, less noise and less distortion at the fringes. The Pixel's rendition is a fair bit sharper as well, something particularly evident in the buildings in the distance.In our office, the OnePlus 6 composed a brighter still-life scene than the Pixel 2 XL, though that came at the expense of some clarity. OnePlus' device fails to properly convey the texture of the leaves, partially due to a lack of sharpness, and partially because of inferior dynamic range. The clouds through the window are also blown out on the OnePlus 6, which highlights the strength of Google's HDR processing.A low-light test demonstrated OnePlus' enhancements weren't just lip service. While the OnePlus 6's shot is perhaps a hair darker, there's so much less noise in comparison to what the Pixel 2 managed that it's really no contest. An impressive feat, considering the Pixel 2's excellent low-light capabilities were primarily the reason why it earned the top spot in our photo comparison against the iPhone X and Galaxy S9+.When it comes to shallow depth-of-field portraits, however, OnePlus still has work to do. The Pixel 2 XL handily outperformed the OnePlus 6 when I snapped photos of my colleague Paul, with crisper detail, more accurate white balance and impressive dynamic range that artfully reined in the highlights and lowlights. The OnePlus 6 was completely thrown off by the intensity of the fluorescent lighting in our office, misinterpreted Paul's skin tone and seemed ever so slightly blurrier all around.I called upon both device's portrait modes a second time to take pictures of a flower, and despite having one less lens on the back, the Pixel 2 XL pulled out yet another gorgeous bokeh-effect shot. The OnePlus 6 applied less blur to the background and generally lacked the warmth that made the lavender burst from the frame in the image captured by Google's flagship.Rounding out the comparison is a selfie from the OnePlus 6's front-facing 16-MP camera that is oddly flat and devoid of contrast. The Pixel 2 XL's shooter may be half the resolution, but there's no doubt it produced a more realistic portrait, visible in the texture of my skin as well as the color of my sweater.Ultimately, while the OnePlus 6's photography won't top the Pixel 2's in every scenario, it will surprise you from time to time. Google's flagship begins at $649 for the 5-inch model, which has identical cameras to the $849 Pixel 2 XL we tested here. That translates to a $120 difference between the base models of OnePlus' and Google's phones. The Pixel's photos are surely better, but whether they're worth at least $120 more is debatable.Either way, owners will appreciate that OnePlus continues to make its cameras better after release. The OnePlus 6's software was updated in June to include Google Lens. Previously, users who wanted to summon Google Lens had to take a picture, then analyze it inside the Google Photos app. Now, that can be done while using the camera in real time.Google Lens appears as a new mode alongside Portrait, Panorama and the rest. Owners can either sideload the new camera APK now or wait for a future OTA update, which will discreetly add the feature.Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor with Adreno 630 graphics, as well as either 6GB or 8GB of RAM depending on the model, the OnePlus 6 is up there with the year's fastest phones. Of course, those specs apply to almost every 2018 Android flagship, so it was interesting to find the OnePlus 6 outperform its rivals by a respectable margin in benchmarks.In Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, our 8GB OnePlus 6 turned in a score of 9,098 — well beyond the LG G7 (8,566) or the Galaxy S9+ (8,295), both of which feature less RAM. In fact, the OnePlus 6 gets closer to the A11 Bionic-powered iPhone X's 10,357 score than any other handset we've tested thus far.3D Mark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 graphics test produced similarly impressive results, with the OnePlus 6 reaching 5,124. Again, that's higher than both the LG G7 at 4,201 and the Galaxy S9+ at 4,634.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowHow can the OnePlus 6 be so much faster with almost identical hardware? It might have something to do with clever under-the-hood tweaks. OnePlus tells us its latest phone renders on-screen content differently than most Android devices, by neglecting to draw layers that aren't visible to the user. Because of this, the company has cited gains of up to 10 percent faster app- loading times. That may explain why the OnePlus 6 not only tests but feels a hair quicker than nearly every phone out there.The OnePlus 6 rarely wavered in its performance, no matter how we  pushed its limits. Whether it was highly demanding multiplayer titles like PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Mobile or crushing a succession of tasks in split-window mode, the phone handled almost everything without breaking a sweat.I say ""almost"" because our real-world test of transcoding a 2-minute 4K video into 1080p via the Adobe Premiere Clip app seemed to trip the OnePlus 6 up. Many premium handsets can do this in less than 3 minutes — Google's Pixel 2's time was 2:55, while the Galaxy S9 took 2:32 and the iPhone X brushed it off in a mere 47 seconds. Yet it took OnePlus' latest phone 3 minutes and 45 seconds to do the same.We haven't witnessed this kind of delay in any other application, and, on paper, the OnePlus 6 seems as though it would be too powerful to lose here. If anything, it's yet more proof that even the most powerful phones aren't perfect across the board, and their advantages and disadvantages reveal themselves in strange ways.Despite all that's changed in the OnePlus 6, the 3,300-mAh battery and Dash Charge technology used in the OnePlus 5 and 5T appear exactly the same here. It's not hard to see why — the OnePlus 5T was clocked as the fastest-charging smartphone of any we tested last year, and it delivered a commendable 11 hours and 22 minutes on our battery test.Now, the OnePlus 6 has a larger screen, but it also has a slightly more efficient chipset, based on Qualcomm's figures on the Snapdragon 845. Unfortunately, the math didn't work out in the phone's favor, as it delivered 10 hours and 33 minutes in the same test, streaming websites from full to empty on T-Mobile's LTE network.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThat's still pretty good in the grand scheme of things — the average smartphone lasts 9:50 on our test — but it is yet another step back after the OnePlus 5 managed 13:06 nearly a year ago. It's also quite a way off from the Huawei Mate 10 Pro's 14:39 and the Pixel 2 XL's 12:09, while the Galaxy S9+ and the iPhone X edged it out just barely at 10:59 and 10:49.Thankfully, Dash Charge remains the miracle charging solution it was the last time around, as the OnePlus 6 once again posted the quickest times we've ever seen. The device reached 30 percent in 15 minutes, 60 percent in 30 minutes and 93 percent in an hour on the stock adapter. Those aren't just spot on with our previous results; they also align perfectly with OnePlus' claims, which, as we found during that aforementioned charging speed test, is  a rare thing in this industry.Android 8.1 Oreo and OnePlus' Oxygen OS 5.1.3 combine for a speedy and intuitive experience on the OnePlus 6, topped off with yet another major feature inspired by the iPhone X. However, this is one you definitely won't want to ignore.OnePlus has introduced its own optional gesture-based navigation system in the OnePlus 6, and it actually differs considerably from what Android P will introduce later this year in a few pleasant ways. For starters, OnePlus' scheme doesn't require any sort of bar to house controls at the bottom of the screen. This is one of the major oversights of the current solution in the Android P beta, as it shows Google has missed the point why gestures might be preferable to buttons in the first place — to allow content to fill more of the display.Without buttons, OnePlus' system works like this: You swipe up to go home, and swipe up and hold to view recent apps, just like the iPhone X. To go back, you swipe up from either the left or right side. I was able to get the hang of it in no time at all, and it’s quickly become my preferred way to use the OnePlus 6.In some ways, OnePlus' gestures are brilliantly simple. Besides freeing up screen space, they're also equally manageable for left- and right-handed users alike, because you can go back from either corner. Although there's no shortcut to open the app drawer from any screen, that doesn't seem to be a terribly costly omission. A bigger MIA feature could be the lack of a suggested apps list when you're thumbing through your recents, but that's a new capability special to Android P that many users probably won't notice missing.No, the biggest problem with OnePlus' system is that it doesn't give Google Assistant a home, because there's no button to long press. Of course you can still access it with ""OK Google,"" but that won't help much if you need to be silent and use the keyboard to type in queries. A few years ago, this might have been inconsequential, but the Assistant has morphed into a powerful asset for users that's becoming increasingly inseparable with Android.Getting rid of a major way to access Google Assistant will surely rub some OnePlus 6 owners the wrong way, but perhaps the company can address that in an update. If not, the traditional three-button navigation remains available, and is still the default setting out of the box.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialIn addition to gestures, OnePlus has expanded its Gaming Mode beyond notification management with a handful of new features. Users can now prioritize data bandwidth for the game they're playing — forcing background processes and apps to take a breather to allow more throughput for multiplayer titles. There's also Gaming Battery Saver, which adjusts performance in apps that use the Unity Game Engine to prioritize longevity, rather than graphics.Finally, Face Unlock returns after its introduction in the OnePlus 5T. While it functions exactly the same as before, using it in these spring months has demonstrated that it's not the best way to reliably unlock the phone if you prefer sunglasses. Our OnePlus 6 never passed the shades test in my experience, though it remained fast as ever when I took them off. And because it operates entirely in 2D without a depth map, it's not as secure as Face ID and can be fooled with a photograph — meaning you still can't use it to authenticate payments.If it were $200 more expensive, the OnePlus 6 would still be worthy of a recommendation. But starting at $529, it's a steal.OnePlus has put on yet another master class in giving buyers exactly the features they want, in a package that is refined, rather than fraught with gimmicks. The performance and display are first rate, the design is meticulous (if a little on the unwieldy side) and the battery, even though it's taken a step back regarding longevity, remains the quickest to get up and running. The software and gestures are thoughtful, and although the camera can t go toe-to-toe with the Pixel 2's, it more than suffices given what you're paying.Even without some desirable extras, like wireless charging, expandable storage or water resistance, the OnePlus 6 gets closer to covering all the bases and fulfilling most buyers' demands than any other smartphone. And it does so while saving you hundreds compared with the $720 Galaxy S9, let alone even pricier handsets like the $849 Pixel 2 XL and the $999 iPhone X.That makes it all the more disheartening that the OnePlus 6 comes with a major caveat — a familiar refrain that lets down the best unlocked devices on our shores: If you subscribe to Verizon or Sprint, you can't use it. If you count yourself among the lucky half of the nation that can, snag a device while they're in stock — OnePlus' devices have a nasty habit of selling out too quickly.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
180,BlackBerry Key2,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blackberry-key2,review-5539.html","At first blush, last year's BlackBerry KeyOne seemed like another reminder of the brand's downfall. While not the first BlackBerry phone to run Android, the KeyOne was built by another phone maker altogether — China's TCL, which makes Alcatel phones and now builds BlackBerry devices as well.But then a funny thing happened: The KeyOne turned out to be quite good — the best BlackBerry in years, with a big battery, solid enough performance, secure software and, of course, a satisfying and innovative physical keyboard.TCL's latest BlackBerry, the Key2, surely won't win over the majority of iPhone, Pixel and Galaxy customers. But then, it shouldn't. Like its predecessor, the Key2 is a specialized tool made for specific users, for whom a physical keyboard still holds cachet. And if you count yourself among their ranks, this phone won't disappoint you. BlackBerry is asking $649 for the Key2, which is $100 more than the KeyOne initially cost. The Key2 has the same 64GB of storage, but RAM has been doubled from the previous 3GB to 6GB. A model with 128GB of built-in storage should become available at a later date, though the phone supports microSD cards for expansion up to 256GB.The Key2 is GSM unlocked, meaning it will only work on networks such as AT&T, T-Mobile, MetroPCS and Cricket. Preorders begin Friday (June 29) and ship July 13 from Amazon and Best Buy.Smartphones have never been as powerful as they are now — nor have they been as homogeneous. As displays get larger, bezels get smaller and physical buttons are retired, there are progressively fewer avenues for industrial designers to demonstrate any creativity.Kudos to TCL, then, for producing a phone in 2018 that doesn't ascribe to any derivative tropes. The Key2 sports similar dimensions to the KeyOne, though it's a hair taller. Unlike its predecessor, however, the Key2 bears no tacky chrome accents or mismatched shapes, edges and materials. This phone is neat and purposeful.TCL shifted up the Key2's 4.5-inch LCD panel and trimmed out some of the top bezel. This allows for a larger keyboard, separated by a row of capacitive buttons that now light up only when the phone is being actively used. The Key2 has none of the visual noise that marred the KeyOne, and it's a much cleaner-looking handset for it.I love the simplicity and sturdiness of the all-aluminum body, which looks dapper in the black configuration. The Key2 retains its predecessor's 3.5-millimeter headphone jack as well as its soft-touch backing — though TCL remixed the pattern for the Key2.It's a diamond texture, rather than the KeyOne's dimpled surface which was reminiscent of leather gloves. Stylistically, the change is debatable, though I find the new material to be a little grippier.On paper, not a whole lot has changed in the Key2's keyboard. TCL increased the size of the keycaps by 20 percent, making for a roomier space for your thumbs to move about, but truthfully, that's not something you're likely to notice, unless you've got the KeyOne next door for comparison purposes.Dig a little deeper, however, and it becomes clear that the Key2's physical input is better, as a result of a bunch of tiny enhancements. The keys themselves exhibit more tactile feedback when you press down on them, but also push back with less resistance. I found it easier to switch from my iPhone 7 to the Key2, rather than the KeyOne, simply because the newer phone's keys required so much less pressure to activate.But then, the Key2's keyboard can do so many things a touch screen's can't. It functions as a trackpad, for example, which provides a great way of scrolling through webpages without obscuring or smudging the display. TCL applied a matte finish to the Key2's keys, unlike the glossy KeyOne. That makes for not only a more modern-looking device but also an easier surface for performing gestures.As with the KeyOne, the spacebar conceals a fingerprint sensor that works about as well as any other fingerprint sensor. However, all the way to the right of it, TCL added a new button that BlackBerry fans won't recognize. The company reckons it represents the biggest change to the brand's physical keyboards in a decade, and it's called the Speed Key.MORE: The Best Cellphone Plans for Families and IndividualsThat seems like an ambitious name, but what the Speed Key does is actually very simple. Most of the other buttons on the keyboard can be combined with the Speed Key to launch a preprogrammed shortcut. It's not as earth-shattering an idea as TCL would probably like you to believe, but it can help you navigate your Key2 a little more quickly.Let's be clear: As innovative as it is, the Key2's keyboard is not going to win over conventional smartphone users. But, if you have a penchant for a more traditional typing experience, you should feel right at home with this phone.There's no arguing the Key2's integrity as a loyal workhorse, but this is not a phone you'll want to watch a movie on — unless you like letterboxing, that is.Rest assured, that's no knock against the quality of TCL's 4.5-inch, 1620 x 1080 LCD panel, which is about as accurate and vibrant as they come. But with an odd aspect ratio of 3:2 (the same as the original iPhone), the Key 2 is very clearly not designed for wide-screen viewing.The display's squareness will certainly take some getting used to if you're coming from a conventional handset. I can't help but wonder what TCL could have achieved with a slide-out approach, like BlackBerry employed with the Priv in 2015. That may have provided the best of both worlds: A no-compromise, wide-screen display with the bonus of a physical keyboard when you wanted it.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialWe'll never know, though to TCL's credit, the company is frank about the Key2's purpose. Productivity is Job One of any BlackBerry, and simply put, the screen never hinders your ability to get things done. Text and graphics look crisp at a density of 434 pixels per inch (for reference, the iPhone X is just a smidge sharper at 458 ppi), while color reproduction is respectable for an LCD panel. The Key2 can also get reasonably bright, with a peak full-screen brightness of 533 nits. That's well above the 466-nit average among smartphones.BlackBerrys have never been renowned for their photo-taking prowess, but TCL has banked big on the camera for the Key2. It's the first dual-lens arrangement in a BlackBerry-branded handset, and it allows for Portrait Mode and 2x optical zoom.To make that possible, TCL gave the Key2 a pair of 12-megapixel shooters, utilizing an f/1.8 aperture for the primary one and an f/2.6 aperture for the telephoto lens. However, the Key2 doesn't employ optical image stabilization on either of its lenses, which puts it at a disadvantage compared to most high-end camera phones.The lack of OIS also harms low-light photography — something that TCL says it focused on improving with the Key2. However, the wider aperture of the main lens couldn't help illuminate this dreary shot of a pair of poorly lit model cars. By comparison, the $529 OnePlus 6 produced a far less grainy result of the very same scene.In a subsequent round of selfies, OnePlus' bargain proved yet again why it's a better shooter in dim conditions. The Key2's 8-MP, front-facing camera delivered a relatively underexposed portrait that muddied my hair and beard and consigned far too much of the frame to the shadows.Outdoors on a sunny June morning, I used both phones' respective 2x optical zoom modes to capture a few stills of a flower. There are aspects of the Key2's photo I actually like here; There's a subtle blur to the background, and the darker hues paint a slightly more realistic shot in comparison to the OnePlus' boosted pinks. Yet, the image from the BlackBerry is also obnoxiously oversharpened and noisy. It looks like the product of a much older — or cheaper — phone.Over time, I started to fear the Key2 would never pick up a win in this comparison. I had high hopes for its Portrait Mode — it's ultimately why any phone really has dual cameras, after all — but they were dashed the moment I attempted to snap a picture of my colleague Jorge. In fact, the Key2's might be the worst application of this feature of any phone I've tested, as a consequence of its general blurriness, poor white balance, grainy bokeh and underexposed highlights.MORE: 5 Ways to Improve Your Android Phone's Battery LifeIt's true that there's a lot of variation in camera quality, even among the most expensive devices. However, paying $649 should guarantee a base level of fidelity, and the Key2 doesn't even reach that. Most buyers probably aren't looking to BlackBerry for excellent photography, but that doesn't excuse TCL's poor showing here, especially at this price.  If we had one gripe with the BlackBerry KeyOne, it pertained to performance. That device was powered by a Snapdragon 625 processor and just 3GB of RAM — a combination that was sufficient at first, but quickly showed its limits over sustained usage.Thankfully, TCL seems to have recognized this shortcoming, because the Key2 has a faster Snapdragon 660 chipset as well as double the RAM, for a total of 6GB.That's an unusual combination, because phones with midrange processors tend not to have so much RAM. In fact, many handsets, like the Samsung Galaxy S9, LG G7 ThinQ and the Sony Xperia XZ2 actually have only 4GB of RAM tied to more powerful Snapdragon 845 silicon.Regardless, TCL is adamant that upgrading the RAM before the processor was the right call for what its users really need. And, I'm actually inclined to agree. With 6GB of RAM, the Key2 is able to keep multiple processes and apps in the air simultaneously. When you think about all the services the modern enterprise user relies upon, that's a bit more valuable than additional top-end power to run the newest and shiniest games.It also compares well to last year's high-end phones. In Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, the Key2 delivered a multicore score of 5,832. That's not terribly far off the Snapdragon 835-powered Google Pixel 2's score at 6,282 — though of course, newer handsets far exceed both devices.However, the Key2 didn't shine where graphics were concerned. It totaled just 1,365 in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1 test. It's worth noting that modern flagships, like the Galaxy S9, handily surpass a score of 4,000 here. The Key2 was able to run less demanding titles, like Injustice, on modest settings with no slowdown, though I wouldn't count on it for hard-core pursuits like PUBG Mobile.   The Key2 comes equipped with the same 3,500-mAh battery that delivered an astonishing 12 hours and 47 minutes of longevity when we tested it in the KeyOne.Just like before, that battery still supports QuickCharge 3.0 and is able to take the Key2 from empty to 50 percent in a half hour. However, TCL has bolstered it with extra software that learns your usage habits and recommends when to top up as you're progressing through your day. Some might appreciate the insight it provides, though in my experience, it didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know from looking at the battery icon.Ultimately, the software is negligible, given just how long the Key2 can endure on a charge. TCL's latest BlackBerry ran for 11 hours and 9 minutes of continuous web surfing on LTE. While it's disappointing that that's about an hour and a half shorter than the KeyOne's runtime, 11:09 is still well beyond the smartphone average of 9:48, and up there with the likes of the Pixel 2 (11:07) and iPhone 8 Plus (11:16). In other words, you should still be able to eke out two days of usage, if you're careful.BlackBerry may have ceded control of its hardware to TCL, but it's still responsible for designing the software for its phones. In fact, if the connection between the two companies is compromised, TCL's production line halts.So yes, BlackBerry still takes software, security and authenticity very seriously. The Key2 launches with Android 8.1 Oreo, with two years of monthly security patches in store, as well as BlackBerry's commitment to deliver hotfixes for more glaring concerns and vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered. The phone will also eventually get one major software update to Android P, though the prospect of another letter upgrade is uncertain.The Key2's flavor of Oreo is pretty close to stock. However, BlackBerry has certainly put its stamp on Android, with a number of additional apps and services. DTEK is probably the most notable; it serves as the control panel for all the Key2's security monitoring tools. From here, you can keep an eye on which apps are using and abusing certain permissions, and DTEK will even notify you which apps are behaving erratically. DTEK also awards your phone with a security score and suggests ways to improve it.It helps to think of DTEK not so much as offering an extra layer of security as providing preventive care. However, BlackBerry's other additions, like Privacy Locker, Privacy Shade and Redactor, offer more immediate value.Privacy Locker allows you to store photos, media and other files in an encrypted folder that can be unlocked only with a fingerprint or password. The Key2 is not the first phone to do this, of course, though BlackBerry's version of the feature also incorporates Firefox's Focus browser, which auto-deletes web history when you close the app.Privacy Shade acts as a window through which you can view content on screen, where everything else around it is obscured to onlookers. It's great for reading supersensitive material while out in public, though what's even more useful about it is Redactor — a markup-style feature that lets you conceal details and blocks of text from screenshots. It's a feature every phone should have, regardless of whether the company is particularly concerned with enterprise-level privacy or not.MORE: 5 Ways to Speed Up Your Android Phone in Under 5 MinutesOtherwise, BlackBerry's hallmark software enhancements return on the Key2. That includes BlackBerry Hub, which aggregates all communications across email, social and chat apps in one unified inbox. The Convenience Key, a button introduced on the KeyOne and then again on the all-touch screen BlackBerry Motion, now supports additional profiles, so the shortcuts you program dynamically change, depending on whether you're home, at work, in a meeting or even in the car.The physical keyboard is polarizing, and so it follows that the Key2 is a very polarizing phone. We've been surprised with some legitimately good BlackBerrys over the past several years, and you can assuredly add the Key2 to the list. This is yet another great handset for the right person.Of course, that always seems to be the caveat with BlackBerry. The best thing I can say about TCL's still-nascent tenure at the helm of manufacturing is that it hasn't skipped a beat. The Key2 may not technically be made by BlackBerry, but it sure as hell feels like a member of the family, thanks to its solid keyboard, lengthy battery life and security and productivity features that you might actually use.The Key2 isn't a mediocre phone with a good physical keyboard — it's a good phone that happens to have a physical keyboard. Still, $649 is a lot to ask for a device with anything less than a leading processor and top-notch camera. You won't find either here, and frankly, it's unclear to me how TCL can justify the $100 premium over last year's already pricey predecessor — even if the Key2 still is truly one of a kind.Credit: Tom's Guide"
181,Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-xperia-xz2,review-5522.html","Once in a blue moon, a product comes around that inexplicably dazzles me. Sony's Xperia XZ2 Compact is one such device.On paper, the slimmed-down, 5-inch version of Sony's flagship Xperia XZ2 seems like a perfectly fine phone, but not markedly different from other Android handsets. When I picked up this phone for the first time, however, I fell in love. It's just so damn cute.Cute isn't a convincing reason to spend $600-plus on anything, but this pint-size phone has a lot going on under the hood, too. If you hate the giant notched displays that almost every 2018 flagship sports, the XZ2 Compact is worth considering. It's basically the iPhone SE of the Android world.You can buy the XZ2 Compact unlocked through Amazon and Best Buy. The device debuted at $649, but you can find one for $50 less in certain colors.Like its bigger sibling, the 5.7-inch XZ2, the Compact is available in only one variant, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, though you can expand that to up to 400GB with a microSD card. You can choose from four colors: Moss Green (which I tested for this review), Black, Coral Pink and White Silver. The phone is compatible with networks from AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, but not Sprint.In a sea of 6-inch phones, the Xperia XZ2 Compact feels positively tiny, and that's a huge part of its charm.The back is a comfortable curved plastic that still manages to feel high-end thanks to its frosted sheen. The Moss Green model I tested was more of a soft teal, with a slight gold tint in some lighting. Compared to the glassy 6-inch slabs that have dominated the market in recent years, the phone feels more comfortable to hold, at least if you have small hands. The Compact actually fits in my jeans pocket, which is a tiny miracle.Every time I picked up the Compact, it reminded me of my very first iPhone, the 3GS. Sony's latest device has a bigger display compared to the 3.5-inch screen on that 3GS, and the new phone leaves off the home button, so that the screen real estate can extend closer to the chin of the device. But the curved plastic back and the fit of the phone in my hand remind me of a time when smartphones were fun; no two devices looked the same, and each one felt like an expression of your personality rather than a utilitarian device attached to your hip.With the XZ2 and XZ2 Compact, Sony finally added functional fingerprint sensors to its U.S. smartphone lineup. On the larger device, the sensor is awkwardly placed, but I didn't have an issue on the smaller Compact. (People with larger hands may have to curve their pointer fingers to unlock their phones.)Sony isn't trying to break the mold with the XZ2 Compact display, but the company isn't following the trends either.There's no notch on the screen. Sony is one of the few smartphone makers that still slaps its logo on the bottom bezel, which I could do without, but at least it's not too obtrusive. And this phone's 18:9 aspect ratio makes playing games and watching videos a good experience, even on a smaller, 5-inch display.The Compact has the same LCD panel as the larger XZ2, and this screen is nothing to write home about. It covers 160.2 percent of the sRGB color gamut and earned a Delta-E score of 0.32. (Delta-E numbers closer to zero mean the screen is more accurate.) The iPhone 8, which has a 4.7-inch LCD panel, covered 119.6 percent of the color gamut and notched a color-accuracy rating of 0.89.In terms of brightness, the Compact reached a perfectly fine 520 nits on our light meter, in line with the phone's LCD-based sibling, the XZ2. But in general, OLED panels are just better: Black levels are perfect, you'll see a wider range of hues, and some of these screens are even brighter than LCD panels, whose brightness has previously been the main selling point.Going from a 6-inch display (or even the 5.5-inch screen on my iPhone 7 Plus) to a 5-inch one is a challenge. Video games aren't quite as immersive, and watching Queen Beyoncé and her husband, Jay-Z, take over the Louvre in their surprise music video wasn't quite as awe-inspiring as it would be on a larger screen.MORE: Cellphone Insurance: The Best and Worst PlansThe smaller on-screen keyboard also takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to typing on a larger device. It's depressing to think that a 5-inch phone is almost too small. How did we manage for so many years?The Compact has the same camera system as the larger XZ2, with all the benefits and drawbacks those lenses offer. (Read more in our XZ2 review.)I compared the Compact to a similarly priced phone, the OnePlus 6, to see which midprice handset gives you better images for your buck. The Compact won in a landslide, even though the OnePlus sports a dual-lens system. You won't get Portrait mode with the XZ2, but you will get richer, clearer, more true-to-life photos.I took both devices out on a floating bar near Brooklyn Bridge Park to capture the downtown Manhattan skyline. Not only does the XZ2 get more buildings in the frame, but also, the lights in each skyscraper are brighter than in the OnePlus 6's photo and the colors of the sky are more dramatic.Both cameras fare better in daylight. In side-by-side captures of yellow lilies in my garden, the XZ2 brought the tallest stem into focus, and the greenery of the surrounding leaves was richer than in the OnePlus shot.Neither camera excels at selfies, but the OnePlus' front-facing lens gave my face a blue tint. The XZ2's 5-megapixel shooter is underwhelming, but the late-afternoon light streaming in through my office window was more accurate in that shot.Like other Sony handsets, the Compact has a dedicated button for opening the Camera app when you long press it with the phone unlocked. While it's not entirely necessary, the dedicated camera button is more useful than an AI assistant button that we will probably never use (looking at you, LG G7 ThinQ).MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowSony put its super-slow-motion video feature in the Compact model, which is more of a novelty than a useful way to capture clips. If Sony improved its phones' front-facing lenses and maybe added a dual-lens system, we would love these phones a whole lot more.Sony put the same cutting-edge Snapdragon 845 processor in the XZ2 Compact as it did in the larger XZ2, placing the Compact on par with some of the premium Android devices currently available. That CPU, combined with 4GB of RAM, allows the XZ2 Compact to run multiple apps and switch between them with ease.Playing PUBG Mobile was a breeze, even as I accidentally parachuted into a river and had to frantically swim to shore. As I procured weapons in abandoned homes and tried to figure out who was shooting at me, I noticed that the XZ2 Compact doesn't grow uncomfortably warm when you're playing this graphically intensive game, like other phones do (even flagships such as HTC's U12+).On the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance, the Compact's score of 8,485 can easily go toe to toe with Sony's flagship XZ2 (8,449). The Compact is light years ahead of Google's Pixel 2, which scored 6,282 in our benchmarking tests thanks to an older Snapdragon 835 processor. The $579 OnePlus 6 with 8GB of RAM scored 9,098 on Geekbench. (We didn't test the 6GB model, but it's even more affordable, at $529.)On 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme graphics benchmark, the Compact edged out the bigger XZ2 on the OpenGL ES 3.1 segment of the test, with a score of 4,699 versus 4,672. It couldn't quite match the cheaper OnePlus 6, which reached 5,124.MORE: The Best Cellphone Plans for Families and IndividualsThe Compact sailed through our real-world video-editing test, exporting a 2-minute 4K clip in Adobe Premiere in 2:35. That's faster than the Pixel 2 (2:55) and the OnePlus 6 (3:45), though the A11 Bionic-powered iPhone 8 remains the champ here, with a 42-second result.Where many phones fall short is battery life, but Sony's XZ2 Compact easily outlasts more-expensive handsets.In the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network, the Compact lasted 10 hours and 39 minutes. Compared to the smartphone average of 9:48, that's a respectable performance.The Compact's battery isn't quite impressive enough for this device to finish among the longest-lasting smartphones. Other handsets, including the larger XZ2 (11:47) and Google's Pixel 2 (11:07), can last longer on a charge, but the Compact can almost match Samsung's Galaxy S9 (10:59).Like the XZ2, the Compact helps helps your battery last longer with two software features: Qnovo Adaptive Charging and Battery Care. The former monitors your phone's battery health when you plug the device in, and the latter learns your charging habits and tops off your battery only when it knows you're about to unplug the phone. The device also supports quick charging, but not wireless charging.What we didn't love about the XZ2 were its gimmicky software features, specifically the Dynamic Vibration system that makes haptic feedback extra strong. The Compact model doesn't have that, and it's better for lacking the feature.MORE: Cellphone Carriers: Best and Worst Customer ServiceThe phone ships with Android Oreo 8.0 layered under Sony's skin. This OS is a little dated — OK, a lot dated — but rumor has it that Sony has a UI redesign planned for Android P's launch later this year. The XZ2 is slated to be upgraded to the latest version of Android, and we expect the Compact model will be, too.It's hard to pinpoint why I'm smitten with the XZ2 Compact. Sure, it offers great performance and solid battery life, and it takes nice photos. But that's not unusual for a premium phone.What really appeals to me is the way it feels. Today, too many smartphones are glassy slabs you couldn't pick out of a lineup. The XZ2 Compact isn't trying to be bold with an edge-to-edge display, a crazy lineup of colors or gimmicky software. Sony isn't buying in to the AI and AR hype or trying to compete with other phone makers. Instead, the XZ2 Compact stands out — not just in its size, but also in its simplicity.Objectively, there are better phones you can buy, but this is my favorite phone of the year so far.Credit: Tom's Guide"
182,Moto E5 Play,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-e5-play,review-5515.html","At $99, the Moto E5 Play is one of the best cheap phones you'll find anywhere. It's also one of the most modest, with a low-spec processor, a 720p display and a removable plastic shell.For the price, though, Motorola's budget phone satisfies all the basic requirements of a handset — and it's our favorite option for keeping your phone's price tag down to double digits.The Moto E5 Play costs $99, but it's not offered unlocked. Rather, you'll have to buy it with service from one of three carriers: Cricket, Boost Mobile or Verizon's prepaid service.As a result, the E5 Play's price differs from vendor to vendor. The Verizon model that we tested costs the full $99, while the $79 Boost and $69 Cricket variants are cheaper. You'll give up a fingerprint sensor on those two less-expensive versions, though.Using the Moto E5 Play transports you to a time when phone makers didn't worry about bezels and materials. Handsets were thick, black slabs encased in plastic, and if your battery died one day, it was no trouble — you'd just go to the store and pick up a replacement.I don't look back fondly on those days, though that's not really the point of the E5 Play. Even if the design is unassuming and forgettable, it gets the job done. And that's really all you can ask for in a $99 smartphone.The E5 Play's 5.2-inch display may be on the smaller side among modern devices, but it should be more than roomy enough for most users. The fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone (at least on Verizon's version of the phone) is also a welcome amenity on such an inexpensive handset. However, given all that space within the bottom bezel, Motorola would have been wise to stash the scanner there instead, to make for a better user experience when the E5 Play is lying screen side up.Otherwise, the E5 Plus is comfortable enough in the hand, even if its finely textured backplate is more slippery than you'd expect. It feels kind of like nylon fabric and provides less grip than a soft-touch surface or even regular glass. Motorola was clearly looking to add a little value to the plastic build here, but I don't think it's helped the phone's ergonomics.MORE: The Best Cellphone Plans for Families and IndividualsThe E5 Plus is not certified as water-resistant, but it has been dusted with a water-repellent nano-coating, which could help in the event of rain or small spills. There's also a headphone jack, and the device charges through a micro-USB port like most budget handsets do, rather than USB Type-C.Don't expect to be terribly impressed by the E5 Play's 5.2-inch LCD display. With a resolution of just 720p, it's easy to discern individual pixels even at a considerable distance. This leads to blurry graphics, photos and videos that lack the crispness you get from other phones' screens — even those that cost about the same.At least the screen's color calibration is pretty realistic. The E5 Play's panel registered a Delta-E accuracy rating of just 0.20. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) That's on a par with the ratings from a number of flagship devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and the Apple iPhone X.However, the range of hues the screen provides is relatively limited. The E5 Play displayed 95 percent of the sRGB color space in our testing, even when the phone was set to the more saturated ""Vibrant"" profile. Practically every handset we test breaks the 100-percent threshold (the $129 Blu R2 Plus hit 119 percent by comparison), so our best advice is to look elsewhere if you want a phone with a display where colors pop.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesTo make matters worse, this is a dim panel, too. Taking the E5 Play outdoors in direct sunlight can be an exercise in frustration as you struggle to read anything on the display. With a peak full-screen brightness of 401 nits, Motorola's latest ultrabudget offering is barely eclipsed by last year's Moto E4 Plus, which topped out at 408 nits.With a single 8-megapixel, f/2.0 camera on the back and another 5-MP shooter up front for selfies, photography on the E5 Play is pretty bare-bones.There's no dual-camera trickery here, nor are there any of the Moto G6's creative shooting modes for capturing cinemagraphs or scenes with partial color. However, Google Lens is built right into the camera software, which means you can easily search through the viewfinder for objects and landmarks without leaving the app.In the right light, the E5 Play can take serviceable photos — like this one from New York City's Bryant Park on a picturesque June afternoon. The phone pulled out vibrant colors from the grass and sky, though some of the highlights and lowlights got either blown out or muddied over in the process. The $149 Alcatel 3V and its 12-MP camera turned in a sharper shot, but botched white balancing left the result looking dreary and almost sepia-toned by comparison.The E5 Play doubled down on the boosted hues to capture a still image of a flower, and the result was a bit too loud for my liking. Additionally, some aspects appeared out of focus. That's because the flower was actually bobbing about in the wind, and the E5 Play had a difficult time locking onto it long enough to take the picture. The Alcatel 3V fared much better in that regard, and although its image is darker, it's also considerably more realistic.I used both phones' front-facing cameras to capture selfies. While neither image is particularly impressive, the photo from the Alcatel phone is downright blurry compared to the E5 Plus' crisper portrait.Overall, Motorola has attempted to gloss over the E5 Play's disadvantage in camera hardware with software overprocessing. It's a popular trick among cheaper handsets, but the results are predictably garish most of the time.The E5 Play will never blow you away with its performance. With just a Snapdragon 425 chipset and 2GB of RAM, this is one of the least-powerful new phones money can buy.That said, even Qualcomm's modest 400 Series processors have enough muscle to navigate Android with ease these days, so the E5 Plus should satisfy most people's basic phone requirements.I put the E5 Play through its paces, summoning multiple tabs in Chrome, running Google Maps in split-window mode, and thumbing back and forth between background apps. I've certainly used snappier handsets, but the E5 Play still managed to get the job done in every instance.Of course, if you want buttery-smooth animations and zero stuttering, this is not the device for you. But if you want a cheap portal to social media, web browsing, navigation, streaming media and other basics, the E5 Play has you covered.You'll have to pick your spots with gaming, though. I tried to play a round of PUBG Mobile on the E5 Play, just to see if I could. I was surprised to find that the game was actually playable, with a serviceable frame rate on the most spartan settings. That said, it's an inconsistent and uninspiring experience. Make no mistake — this is no phone for gamers.MORE: Cellphone Insurance: The Best and Worst PlansBenchmarking in 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test only reconfirmed those suspicions. The E5 Play managed a score of just 6,118, compared with 12,616 for the $249 Moto G6. On Geekbench 4, which tests overall system performance, the E5 Play peaked with a multicore result of 1,789. Meanwhile, the G6 was more than twice as fast, scoring 3,934.The E5 Play has a 2,800-mAh battery, which isn't particularly generous for a modern phone.Therefore, it came as little surprise when the phone lasted just 8 hours and 51 minutes while streaming websites over LTE in our battery test. That's well short of the 9:50 smartphone average, as well as the runtimes from the Moto G6 (9:24) and the year-old Moto E4 Plus (14:48).Additionally, because the E5 Play uses micro USB (rather than the newer, increasingly popular USB Type-C), it doesn't charge very quickly. That's somewhat expected given the phone's price. However, the one benefit of a device this cheap is that the battery is removable.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeOn one hand, it's reassuring to know that, if the battery isn't getting the job done a year or two from now, you can easily replace it. Then again, the E5 Play isn't a device you'll want to hang on to for more than two years anyway — so that's kind of a moot point.There are still plenty of Android phones out there running terribly outdated versions of Android. Thankfully, the Moto E5 Play isn't one of them.The E5 Play comes with Android 8.0 Oreo installed, and it's quite a light installation of the software. Motorola doesn't really skin Google's software in any significant way, so the experience feels fresh and fast, without a deluge of gimmicks.What few additions Motorola has made are housed in one easy-to-find app, called Moto. Here, you can switch on various functions, like Moto Display, which nonintrusively surfaces notifications to the screen even while the phone is sleeping. There's also a three-finger press gesture to quickly capture screenshots, as well as the ability to flip the device to instantly activate Do Not Disturb mode.MORE: How to Reduce Data Usage on Your SmartphoneUnfortunately, Motorola tends to skip software updates for its least-expensive phones. That means E-series owners shouldn't expect an upgrade to Android P, which is only a few months away from public release. That's disappointing, but it's also par for the course in this price range. You'll have to fork over extra dough for a Moto G6 if you want everything the upcoming version of Android has to offer.There's something to be said for modest handsets like the Moto E5 Play. It's admirable that Motorola continues to lower the barrier of entry to a modern smartphone running up-to-date software. Like previous E-series devices, the E5 Play is a leader in its segment.However, this latest phone doesn't really set a new bar for budget phones in any meaningful way. Sure, the fingerprint sensor is an appreciated inclusion (at least on the Verizon version), but the E5 Play's dated design, chintzy materials and limited battery life make it a device few would be excited to own.Just because you're spending less than $100 doesn't mean you shouldn't be enthusiastic about your purchase. If you can afford to upgrade, consider last year's Moto E4 Plus, which actually offers slightly faster performance and way better battery life for $179, or the Honor 7X, which gives you a full-screen design and small bezels for $199. But if those devices are beyond your price limit, the E5 Play is a great entry-level option — so long as you temper your expectations.Credit: Tom's Guide"
183,HTC U12+,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/htc-u12-plus,review-5492.html","Powerful performance. Four amazing cameras. Damn near perfect design. HTC created a beautiful device with the U12+, which is almost better than it has any right to be.But absolutely awful pressure-sensitive buttons and lackluster battery life prevent this phone from being a must-buy, and without carrier retail availability, the U12+ probably won’t threaten Samsung’s Galaxy S9.The U12+ is available to unlocked in the U.S. on HTC's website and Amazon. A 64GB version comes in Translucent Blue and Ceramic Black for $799, and a 128GB option in Translucent Blue is $849.The phone is compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon's networks, but will not be available to buy through a carrier.As every smartphone maker under the sun follows the notch design trend set by Apple's iPhone X, it's refreshing to see a flagship phone in 2018 that goes its own way. What's troubling is how the buttons feel (hint: not like buttons at all).HTC's new flagship eschews a notch at the top of its screen in favor of slim bezels surrounding its Gorilla Glass-coated display. The screen's forehead houses the phone's earpiece and two front-facing cameras for face unlocking and portrait selfies. The chin is a little thick, given that it's unused by even a logo, but we can forgive the wasted space.The U12+ really shines when you turn it over to admire the Liquid Surface design. The phone comes in three shades: Ceramic Black, Translucent Blue and Flame Red. The black option is forgettable, but the latter two are standouts.For this review, I used the blue model, which is a transparent slate-cobalt color that offers a glimpse into the phone's components. There's nothing else like this on the market right now. The Flame Red, which isn't available in the U.S. yet, looks pink in some angles and gold in other light, just like fire.It’s refreshing to see that HTC is still trying to woo buyers with high design, even after Google acquired its smartphone-engineering team.There's one major flaw in the phone's design, though. Its volume and power buttons look like mechanical buttons, but don't depress when you push them. You feel a click when you press down, but the buttons don't actually move, which is a disorienting sensation that I never got used to during my time with the U12+.The power button is particularly sensitive to touch, so I would accidentally put the phone to sleep while trying to use the device's Edge Sense squeeze controls (more on those later). If HTC had chosen mechanical buttons instead of these, the U12+ would be one of the best phones of the year.Unfortunately, the U12+ fails to impress when you flip it over to use its 6-inch display.HTC's latest isn't as bright, rich or colorful as rival Android flagships, even those that also have LCD screens. In fact, this panel doesn't even match the one on last year's U11.I streamed a trailer for the Halloween reboot on the S9+ and U12+ side-by-side and found the U12 was much dimmer, with brightness bumped up to the max on both displays. Michael's  Halloween mask gleamed white on the S9+, and the black of night was much richer as he prowled the streets terrorizing Jamie Lee Curtis.LCD panels tend to be brighter, even if their colors aren't quite as true to life. Yet the U12+ reached a peak brightness of just 389 nits on our light meter, far short of the U11 (512 nits), Samsung's Galaxy S9 (603 nits), Galaxy S9+ (630 nits) and the G7 ThinQ (a whopping 900 nits).With brightness turned all the way up, the screen was visible in bright sunlight, but it wasn't as easy to read text or see the preview of an image in the camera app on the U12+ as on the G7 ThinQ, for instance.The U12+ fares better when it comes to reproducing the sRGB color gamut, covering 131.9 percent compared with the 138.8 percent covered by the G7 ThinQ, which also sports an LCD panel. The Galaxy S9 and S9+, which both offer incredible OLED displays, cover 220 percent and 231 percent, respectively. The U12+ also offers a setting to switch between sRGB and DCI-P3 color profiles. You can also adjust the color range and saturation so that it's warmer or cooler depending on your preference.MORE: 10 Reasons Android Beats the iPhoneThe U12+'s display was true to life when it comes to color accuracy, with a Delta-E score of 0.27 (numbers closer to 0 are better). To compare, the U11 scored 0.34 and LG's G7 ThinQ scored 0.37.The U12+ is shipping with its own Sense UI layered over Android 8.0. Sense isn't radically different from stock Android, and HTC has ditched the Sense Companion voice-activated assistant it created to compete with Google Assistant in the U11. The U12+ supports Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa.This time around, HTC is upping the ante with the second generation of Edge Sense, its squeeze-driven navigation tool.First, you set up your squeeze-force level — how hard you have to press to trigger an action — by squeezing your phone with your preferred pressure level three times. To test it, the device prompts you to squeeze to fill up a balloon, then release the pressure to launch it. You then test the double-tap feature, which pins a mini window to the bottom right or bottom left of the display for easier one-handed use.Edge Sense's default settings are a short squeeze to launch the Camera app, a double tap on the side frame for one-handed mode and a holding gesture to keep your phone in portrait mode as you lie down to read. Most phones will automatically flip to landscape mode if you hold them sideways, but this Edge Sense gesture prevents that from happening. You can assign other actions for all but the holding gesture in Settings > Edge Sense.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialI am torn over the usefulness of a squeezable phone. Some of the Edge Sense gestures, like  keeping the phone in portrait orientation as I lay down to mindlessly browse the internet, were incredibly useful. Others, like squeezing to call up the Camera app, I never remembered to use.With two cameras in front and two on the back of the device, the U12+ is a capable shooter that offers crisp details in outdoor light. It's not the best smartphone camera you can buy, but it's near the top of the heap.The 12-megapixel wide-angle main lens and 16-MP telephoto secondary shooter on the rear of the HTC U12+ create gorgeous, true-to-life shots, in both regular and portrait mode.The bokeh effect, which blurs the background and brings the subject into focus, can be used in auto or manual modes, so the camera can do all the work or you can control the amount of blur. (These modes are also available in the front-facing camera.)To see how the U12+ compares to similar phones, we pitted it against LG's G7 ThinQ, which uses artificial intelligence to optimize the camera settings depending on what you're shooting. In a shot of the New York skyline beyond Bryant Park, the U12+ was the clear winner. The color of the overcast sky was more true to reality; the contrast of the library against the sky was more pronounced; and you could more easily see the details in the blades of grass compared with the G7, which saturated the sky and lawn but failed to bring out the scene's details.But the G7 edged out the U12+ in side-by-side shots of the same flower bed. The hot pink petals were more brilliant and the leaves more emerald in the G7's shot versus the U12+, though the U12+ image was slightly more accurate.I prefered the U12+ to the Galaxy S9+, which also sports a dual-lens camera, when I shot a dripping ice cream cone outside my favorite sweets shop. The contrast of the honeycomb ice cream trickling down the pretzel cone and the richness of the chocolate were more evident in the U12+'s shot, compared with the S9+'s.Two lenses create a better depth effect for front-facing portrait selfies, but it turns out you don't need two front-facing cameras to pull that off. The S9+, with its lone front-facing lens, did a better job of capturing the color of my hair and lipstick than the two lenses in the U12+.The U12+ is more than just a pretty face. The device packs in powerful flagship performance, thanks to 6GB of RAM and the latest Snapdragon 845 processor. Over about a week of use, I found HTC's newest phone to be perfectly responsive, handily navigating multiple browser tabs, apps, maps, games and more.As I traversed through fields, hid inside empty houses and picked off enemies on a mission to obtain more weapons in PUBG Mobile, the U12+ never stuttered. The phone did grow warm as I neared a half hour of play, but that was a sign I needed to stop defending my territory and head to bed.The U12+ scored 4,562 on 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1, a test of graphics performance, just shy of Samsung's Galaxy S9+ score of 4,634. The U12+ exceeded the LG G7 ThinQ's performance (4,201).On Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, the U12+ scored 9,014, besting the impressive score of 8,295 posted by the S9+. The U12+ also easily outscored the G7 ThinQ (8,566). Only the OnePlus 6 equipped with 8GB of RAM turned in a better score among Android phones.MORE: The Best Cellphone Plans for Families and IndividualsIn a real-world test of processing power, exporting a 2-minute 4K video file in Adobe Premiere, the U12+ took 3 minutes and 13 seconds. The device was faster than the Galaxy S9 (3:29) and the G7 ThinQ (3:16) but fell short of the Galaxy S9+ (2:32). No Android phone can quite match the iPhone X and its A11 Bionic processor here, as Apple's phone handles this task in 42 seconds.Smartphone battery life is becoming a more important consideration for buyers, and this is where HTC continues to underperform compared with its competition. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test — continuous web surfing over T-Mobile’s LTE network — the U12+ clocked in at 9 hours and 13 minutes. That's 37 minutes less than the smartphone average of 9:50, which isn't going to cut it in 2018. The Galaxy S9+ lasted 10:59, and the smaller S9 is almost as good, at 10:52.The U12+ doesn't even live up to its predecessor, the U11, which clocked in at 9:38. It does outlast LG's similarly priced G7 ThinQ, which endured for 8:35. HTC's latest release does support quick-charging, with a Quick Charge 3.0 cable included in the box that can juice up your phone from 0 to 50 percent in 35 minutes.MORE: 5 Ways to Improve Your Android Phone's Battery LifeWireless charging seems like a no-brainer for a flagship at this price, but unfortunately, the U12+ doesn't offer that, despite its glass back. If this phone had more impressive battery life, we could more easily overlook its other flaws.The U12+ reaches for a high bar with excellent cameras, powerful performance and beautiful design, but falls short where it matters for many potential buyers with frustrating buttons, underwhelming battery life and a duller-than-average display. The fact that it's not available to order through carriers and is only on sale online makes the U12+ an even tougher sell.For just $40 more, you can snag Samsung’s Galaxy S9+, which sports similar specs (including 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and a Snapdragon 845 processor) with a larger, more brilliant 6.2-inch display. Plus, you'll get real buttons.HTC's design and engineering teams helped create Google's best phones, and with that team headed off to Google to build future Pixels, it's tough to see where HTC’s mobile efforts go from here.Credit: Tom's Guide"
184,PanoClip,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/panoclip,review-5471.html","PanoClip takes a novel approach to 360-degree smartphone photography. Instead of selling you a device with two cameras built in, its accessory simply uses the cameras already on your phone. This strategy has a few advantages — for example, the PanoClip costs $49, which is much less than other 360-degree cameras — but it has a few drawbacks too, which I discovered during my testing.The PanoClip itself is a white, rectangular box that's slightly wider than the iPhone X and about an inch and a half thick. On each of the long sides is a lens, and in the bottom is a slot into which you insert the iPhone. Once the phone is fully inserted, the PanoClip's two lenses correspond to the front and rear cameras on the iPhone. It's a clever idea.PanoClip's free app (which you need in order to use this accessory) takes a photo from both of the iPhone's cameras in quick succession and then stitches them together.From there, you can add stickers and filters, and then share the photo in a variety of formats, such as a standard 360-degree photo or an animation that slowly pans the camera. PanoClip's app also lets you view 360-degree photos and videos taken by those who own the PanoClip as well as Insta360 cameras.MORE: Best 360-degree CamerasThe PanoClip is available for the iPhone X, iPhone 6/7/8 and iPhone Plus models. An Android version is on the way, but timing for that has not been announced.Photos I took with the PanoClip were generally pretty good; the app adequately adjusted for different lighting conditions and did a good job of stitching the two images together. However, there's one thing the PanoClip couldn't account for: the superiority of the iPhone X's rear 12-megapixel camera over that of its front 7-MP TrueDepth camera.The half of the photo that was taken with the rear camera was far sharper than that taken with the front camera. Details, such as the windows of buildings and the leaves on trees, were far crisper on one half of the photo than on the other half.Just to make sure, I took one photo and then spun 180 degrees and took a second photo. The half that was sharper on the first photo was much less so on the second picture. The lesser of the two halves wasn't horrible — I could still make out my face clearly, and skin tones were accurate — but the difference was very noticeable.At $49, the PanoClip is the least-expensive 360-degree camera accessory out there. It's half the price of devices like the Samsung Gear 360 and the Insta360 Nano, making this type of photography even more affordable for the masses.MORE: Best Lens Kits for iPhone PhotographersHowever, there are some limitations to PanoClip's approach. Because the cameras it relies on aren't the same, you end up with a picture where one half is clearly better than the other half. If you can live with that, then you'll find plenty to like about this affordable 360-degree camera accessory.Credit: PanoClip"
185,Nokia 6.1,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/nokia-6-1,review-5464.html","The road back to relevancy has been a bumpy one for Nokia, but things finally look to be smoothing out. HMD Global, a company fronted by former executives of the Finnish phone maker, reintroduced the famed brand to the industry last year with new Android phones carrying the Nokia name.Included in that initial rollout was the Nokia 6, an unremarkable midrange handset that found few fans because of a dated design and middling performance.The new Nokia 6.1 ($269) rights many of its predecessor's missteps, while still managing to keep things affordable. The result is a phenomenally refined budget phone that easily qualifies as the best product Nokia has lent its name to in an eternity.The $269 Nokia 6.1 is a 5.5-inch unlocked phone that comes equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. That's the lone configuration of the device, and it comes in one color — a mix of matte-black aluminum with copper trim. The Nokia 6.1 is currently available from Best Buy and Amazon, and will only work on GSM carriers such as T-Mobile and AT&T.During the years when Microsoft owned the Nokia name, Nokia phones were known for an iconic aesthetic marked by playful colors, unique materials and soft, rounded forms. None of HMD Global's handsets have inherited any of that flair, but the Nokia 6.1 still cleans up nicely, mostly due to its simplicity.The chassis of the Nokia 6.1 was fashioned from a block of 6000-series aluminum, bathed in a matte-black coating and finished off with some copper accents lining its diamond-cut edges and camera housing. The fingerprint sensor, which had been located within the front bezel between a set of ancient-looking capacitive navigation keys on last year's Nokia 6, moves to the back. Nokia has even included NFC as part of the package — a rarity on sub-$300 phones, which typically lack the technology for tap-and-pay transactions.All in all, for a cheaper device, the Nokia 6.1 is elegant and feels solidly built. However, it is still last year's model at heart, and that means the chunky bezels, sharp corners and 16:9 screen are still here to stay. The proportions are out of style, even if the attention to detail isn't.Personally, I don't find that to be a deal breaker, nor do I think an 18:9 display is objectively better than a standard, wide-screen one. But if it's important to you to have a device that follows 2018's prevailing design trends, you should know that the Nokia 6.1 doesn't. For one, it's not as pocketable and easy to use one handed as the perfectly proportioned Moto G6.The 5.5-inch 1080p IPS LCD screen on the Nokia 6.1 is standard for this price range. But when a panel is as vibrant as the Nokia 6.1's, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The Nokia 6.1 doesn't offer a plethora of alternate color profiles or settings, but it’s display quality strikes an excellent balance between being realistic and saturated.Whether it's the earthy, rustic storybook world of Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh, or the bold primary hues of Incredibles 2, everything on the Nokia 6.1's display simply looks how it should. This was reflected in testing, where the device covered 142 percent of the sRGB color space. That's not bad at all for a budget LCD screen.MORE: 11 Cheap Android Smartphones (Under $250) Ranked Best to WorstYou can expect accurate hues from the Nokia 6.1's panel, as the device turned in a Delta-E rating of 0.26 (numbers closer to zero are better). This is about as spot-on as any screen we've tested in any price category and is even a little better than the Moto G6's 0.39 result.At a peak brightness of 450 nits, the Nokia 6.1's display surpasses both the $249 Moto G6 (at 413 nits), as well as the 433-nit smartphone average. But we've seen devices in this price range perform much better, like last year's Moto G5 Plus at 591 nits.Nokia has steered clear of trendy, dual-camera tricks and AI-enabled image recognition in its latest budget phone. All owners get in the Nokia 6.1 is a 16-megapixel, f/2.0 lens for the back and an 8-MP, f/2.0 lens for the front.That may not sound particularly flashy on paper, but special camera features in a device priced as low as this one rarely, if ever, impress. Where it counts, the cameras in Nokia's latest are pretty standard. They handle some scenes reasonably well, and others not so much.Outdoors, the Nokia 6.1 favored warmer, softer shots on a sunny day in a park alongside the Delaware River. Compared to the Moto G6, the Nokia produced images with more lifelike hues, unlike the overly cool greens and blues displayed by Motorola's handset. However, the Nokia 6.1 couldn't adequately light the darker regions, and so the contrast could have benefited from a bit more balance between the shadows and highlights.On the other hand, selfies seemed a tad more crisp on the Nokia 6.1. The Moto G6 opted for a much warmer tint here that I think looks a little more flattering, but it's hardly lifelike. Motorola's device also failed to rein in those highlights, particularly the rays on sunlight falling on the ground in the distance.However, when it came time to test out the Nokia 6.1's low-light capabilities, the phone struggled. The Moto G6 did a much better job illuminating this dimly lit scene of a couple of vinyl figurines. Nokia's handset couldn't pick up the intensity of Pac Man's red shoes or Mega Man's metallic blue armor. You'll also notice some of that color bleeding into the rest of the frame, inelegantly mingling with the background.MORE: Best Android Camera Apps - Take Better Pictures on Your PhoneNone of these are bad photos per se, but the images shot by the Nokia 6.1 don't stand out in any appreciable way, either. The shortcomings always seem to be the same: the shadows are too dark and everything isn't quite as clear or in focus as it should be. The Nokia 6.1's cameras won't surprise you, but that's true of most smartphones at this price.The Nokia 6.1 is powered by the same processor and RAM spec as the last Android One phone, the Moto X4 Android One. But whereas that phone launched at $399 (Google now offers the X4 at $249 when you join its Project Fi network), the Nokia costs $130 less.That's pretty fantastic hardware for the price, and thankfully, performance feels just as speedy, despite the money you'd save. The Snapdragon 630 and 3GB of RAM in the Nokia 6.1 will hit their limit sooner than Qualcomm's top-of-the-line 845 platform, but unless you're a heavy gamer or are put off by app launching times that are fractions of a second longer, you aren't likely to notice a massive difference.The less encouraging news is that even though there's no difference between the processor inside Nokia and Motorola's Android One-powered products, Nokia's fared worse during benchmarking. The 6.1 topped out at 3,784 in Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance, while the X4 delivered 4,122. That's even inferior to the just-released Moto G6, which technically has a less capable 450-class processor, but still beat the 6.1 by about 200 points in the same test.At least graphics performance was on par with the X4. In 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark, which targets lower-end phones, the Nokia 6.1 achieved 16,847. That barely edges the X4 at 16,815 and the even less impressive G6, making Nokia's latest the best-performing handset in graphics performance at its price.Inside the Nokia 6.1 is a 3,000-mAh battery, which doesn't sound particularly special in terms of capacity. However, the pack lasted long enough to turn in a very good 10 hours and 24 minutes in our Tom's Guide battery test, which streams websites until the phone shuts down on T-Mobile's LTE network.MORE: 5 Ways to Improve Your Android Phone's Battery LifeThat's not quite as good as the Moto X4's 11 hours and 41 minutes, let alone really long-lasting phones like the Moto E4 Plus, which miraculously chugged along for 14-and-a-half hours. But it is better than the $199 Honor 7X or Moto G6, which gave out at 9:21 and 9:25, respectively. The average smartphone lasts 9:50 on our test.Additionally, the benefit of quick charging via USB-C means the Nokia 6.1 can reach 50 percent in just 30 minutes, using the stock adapter.Think of Android One as Pixel for the lower-priced market, similar to the Google Play Edition of popular flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One from years past. These devices are built by other companies, but they run unadulterated, current versions of Android. And that translates to the kind of software experience you'd expect from much more expensive Pixel phones, but on handsets costing a fraction of the price.Put another way, there's very little to say about inexpensive phones that run Google's Android One software. And they're better for it.So many less powerful devices would benefit from running lighter installations of Android devoid of battery-taxing bloatware and gimmicky features. Yet, Android One remains quite rare: Only two devices from two different manufacturers in the U.S. belong to the program.The Nokia 6.1 launches with Android 8.1 Oreo. Because it's an Android One product, that means owners will get two years of OS updates and three years of security patches. That's a big deal for a budget phone, considering many devices selling for less than $300 are typically only guaranteed just one OS upgrade, if they receive any at all.Coupled with its solid internals, the commitment to long-term support makes the Nokia 6.1 a bargain that should last you much, much longer than bargains typically do.Nokia didn't try to do too much with the 6.1, but that makes for a better end product. The company took a sturdy, if modest, design, and bolstered it with an excellent display, class-leading specs and a peerless software experience. The result feels like a premium device, even if the Nokia 6.1 doesn't command premium prices.Motorola and Honor have commanded the market for unlocked budget Android phones over the past few years, but the Nokia offering has given them both a run for their money here. The Honor 7X is considerably cheaper, but it has a frustrating interface. The Moto G6 is the Goldilocks of the budget realm, with a design that flirts with perfection, but Motorola isn't backing it up with the software support its phone deserves, and its battery life is not as good as the Nokia 6.1's endurance chops.True, the Nokia 6.1 costs more than either of those phones. However, at $269, it's still a tremendous value, and in this case the added expense is well worth it. In fact, the only handset that can really compete is the other Android One phone out there: the Project Fi-ready, discounted Moto X4.If you only have about $300 to spend on a phone, you shouldn't sleep on the Nokia 6.1. It's not only the company's best phone in years; it's one of the best phones of the year, full stop.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
186,LG G7 ThinQ,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-g7-thinq,review-5390.html","The name of LG’s new flagship phone — the G7 ThinQ — doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. LG tacked on the ThinQ moniker (pronounced “thin Q” and not “think”) to emphasize how smart this smartphone is.And the G7 is pretty intelligent. Its 16-megapixel dual-lens rear camera can adjust its settings on the fly for any scenario you’re shooting in, which makes it dummy-proof. The phone’s focus on Google Assistant, in the form of a dedicated button beneath the volume controls, means you can tap Google to perform many basic tasks.But a great camera and helpful voice-activated assistant are just table stakes for premium smartphones in 2018. LG could have differentiated the G7 with a fresh design, but instead the company made an Android version of Apple’s iPhone X, complete with a notch (though one you can disguise with a software bezel, suggesting that LG isn’t committed to it). The G7 ThinQ is a solid phone, but it isn’t the boundary-pushing stand-out that the company needs to compete with Apple and Samsung.We've updated this review now that the LG G7 ThinQ is on sale, with pricing information.In the U.S., the G7 ThinQ will only be available to order through a carrier. Sprint, Verizon and T-Mobile now sell LG’s latest flagship, with the phone costing $750 at T-Mobile and Verizon and $792 at Sprint. Project Fi, Google's wireless service, plans to offer the phone, too, though it's still listed as coming soon at that site. You can also get the G7 at US Cellular if you live within that regional carrier's coverage area.AT&T is forgoing the G7 in favor of the more expensive LG V35 ThinQ, which has the same camera features as the G7 but features an OLED screen instead. That phone goes on sale June 8.This review is based on my time with a U.S. pre-production unit.A smartphone with an edge-to-edge display that sports a cut-out for the front-facing camera and handset earpiece — otherwise known as a notch — isn’t exactly cutting-edge anymore. Apple Essential and Huawei all have flagships with cut-outs at the top of their expansive displays; Asus will soon join them. The OnePlus 6, set to be unveiled later this month, is rumored to feature a notch, too. So when LG took the wraps off the G7 ThinQ, complete with a notch, we weren’t surprised. At this point, Samsung is the lone hold-out.The G7’s 6.1-inch, 3120 x 1440 display has a larger than standard 19.5:9 aspect ratio, which makes it wider than the 18:9 screen on last year’s LG G6. The new phone’s notch is easily disguised with a software-based bezel under Settings > Display > New Second Screen. There are five bezel colors to choose from, including a rainbow gradient. But when you select black to disguise the notch altogether, the cut-out is still visible if you look closely. That’s because brightly lit LCD panels can’t match the true black and richer colors of an OLED display.MORE: These Smartphones Can Replace a Compact CameraIt’s also unclear why LG calls the software bezel a “new second screen,” similar to a feature available on the LG V20 a few years ago, because it’s not really a second screen. It’s just where your icons live. You still have to swipe down to view notifications.The G7’s display covers 138.8 percent of the sRGB color gamut, compared to the 231 percent covered by the Galaxy S9’s OLED panel. Samsung’s panels are impressive. To compare, Huawei’s $799 Mate 10 Pro also has an OLED display, but its color range and accuracy are in line with the G7’s. The Mate 10 Pro covers 147.2 percent of the color gamut and scored 0.62 on the Delta-E color accuracy test (numbers closer to zero are better). The G7 notched a 0.37 Delta-E score.The G7’s display was bright and clear when I streamed the latest Ant-Man and the Wasp Trailer on YouTube, but the Galaxy S9’s screen was easily the winner. Ant-Man’s crimson suit and the gleaming red of a smashed tomato popped through Samsung’s phone. The colors were less saturated on the G7’s display.One of the G7’s selling points is its brightness. LG says its display can reach peak brightness of 1,000 nits, which means it should be easier to view in daylight. We simulated glaring sunlight in our indoor lab and used a light meter to determine how bright the LCD panel could get. The G7 cleared 900 nits with brightness turned to 100 percent, which is the highest peak we’ve seen in any smartphone we’ve tested.But that doesn’t mean much in real-world scenarios. I used the G7 outside many times over the course of my time reviewing the device, usually with brightness turned up all the way, and the display didn’t seem any brighter than other phones I’ve used. When we shot the G7 on a slightly overcast day in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, our photographer couldn’t see any detail on the screen at all through his DSLR lens, so we had to move to a shaded location.The G7 ThinQ looks like the iPhone X and Galaxy S9 had a baby. The device, which is a little over six inches tall, is covered with Gorilla Glass 5. Like last year’s G6, the G7 supports wireless charging. And LG is keeping the headphone jack around on this phone. A new button located a safe distance from the volume rocker on the side of the device calls up Google Assistant. (More on that later.)Overall, the G7 is a nice-looking phone. LG offers four shades: Platinum Gray, Aurora Black, Moroccan Blue and Raspberry Rose, which is the version I tested for this review. The phone feels comfortable to hold, though not exactly easy to use one-handed. It’s also incredibly lightweight at 5.71 ounces, making it more svelte than the G6 but not quite as light as LG’s own V30.But LG is playing it safe with this phone. The company was a trendsetter when it introduced the G6, which was part of the first wave of smartphones to feature an edge-to-edge display with super-thin bezels and an ultra-wide 18:9 aspect ratio. Now it feels like the company is trying to catch up to Apple and Samsung. The notch, the assistant button, the high-shine, jewel-toned finishes — LG isn’t breaking any molds. It’s not even trying.One of the G7’s standout features is its 16-megapixel dual-lens camera. LG has been putting a standard lens and a secondary wide-angle lens in its cameras for a few generations now, but the G7’s camera system is a lot smarter.Like the V30 and V30S ThinQ he device uses EyeEm’s image recognition technology to identify 1,162 objects and categorize them in 18 scenes, such as food, flowers and landscape. In AI mode, which you can turn off, the camera automatically optimizes its settings depending on what you’re shooting. Once it locks onto the scene, the phone vibrates lightly to give you the go-ahead to start shooting. An icon denoting the scene, such as a fork and knife for food or a snowflake for snow, appears on the lower left of the live preview so you know that the camera settings are tuned to the correct category.The image recognition, which happens almost instantly, is almost always spot-on. Occasionally the camera will misidentify a scene, like when I was shooting a bed of tulips and a snowflake icon appeared on-screen, but it corrects itself within a few seconds if you aim the camera elsewhere and then point it back toward the scene you want to capture.AI gives LG’s camera a leg up on the competition. I captured tulips in full bloom at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens on both the G7 and dual-lens shooter on Samsung’s Galaxy S9+. With AI assistance, the G7 captured the saturated shades of marigold, lilac, peach and pink tulips contrasted with the green of the flower stems and grass. The S9+ capably captured the flower beds, but its images were less vivid and the color contrasts were less stark compared to the G7.But the G7’s camera failed to impress when I attempted to shoot the Chrysler Building from a few blocks away. The camera captured the richly hued purple flowers at the edge of the frame, but details in the slightly overcast sky and in the Chrysler Building’s windows were missing. The Mate 10 Pro’s camera, which also offers image recognition features, more accurately captured the scene’s contrasts, such as the white cloud wisps against the blue sky. The Chrysler Building appears more starkly against the blue backdrop. The Galaxy S9+ also captured the sky more accurately than the G7, but the Mate 10 Pro took the best shot here.When it comes to food photography, the G7 wins. Its camera, which automatically optimized its settings for food, highlighted the contrasts of golden doughnut, white sugar and deep brown chocolate drizzle. The same plate of mini doughnuts appeared dull in the images captured by the S9+ and the Mate 10 Pro.The G7 also shines in low-light scenarios. LG uses pixel binning, which combines four nearby pixels into one superpixel to quadruple light sensitivity, to deliver brighter photos without flash. This happens automatically, but the device alerts you when it activates low-light mode and you can turn it off by tapping the low-light icon on-screen. The processing takes several seconds, comparable to taking a photo with flash, but at least you’re not blinding anyone.I found the G7’s low-light mode delivered better shots of objects than of people. The dimmer the environment, the lower the resolution, so while the image is bright, it’s also full of noise. Photos of friends in an extremely dark bar made it seem like they were having drinks a brightly lit room, but the image quality looked like I had used my 2006-era flip phone to shoot them. Photos of beers in a dimly lit outdoor bar were much less noisy.The G7 is unusual in that the secondary lens in its dual-lens set-up is a wide-angle lens rather than a telephoto one, but the device is still capable of shooting portraits where the subject of the photo is brought into focus and the background is blurred. A sliding tool on the the live preview lets you adjust the strength of the portrait effect, and you can also edit the image after shooting.I found the live preview didn’t accurately show what the final portrait would look like — the resulting photo was always better than the preview indicated, which is good, but I wish the preview was more true-to-life.The 8-megapixel front-facing camera is also capable of shooting portraits. Like the rear camera, the G7’s selfie cam’s portrait effect can be adjusted in post. The front-facing portraits are best for solo selfies. For duos or groups, you have to position everyone so you’re all on the same plane; otherwise one person will be blurred into the background.The G7’s audio prowess is a highlight that sets the phone apart. LG turned the inside of the G7 into a resonance chamber, which makes the device a powerful speaker when you pump the volume up.“That’s probably enough to annoy an entire subway car,” my husband said as I blasted Justin Timberlake’s thumping “Damn Girl.”The G7 is noticeably louder than other smartphones, as I learned when I played the same song on the stereo speakers my iPhone 7 Plus to compare. The G7’s sound was definitely booming. But it’s still just a smartphone speaker. If you want to blast tunes as you clean your house or need a speaker to provide the soundtrack to your next party, you’ll need something more powerful, like a Bluetooth speaker.The G7’s built-in DTS-X 3D surround sound is the audio feature I really need. When you plug in a pair of wired headphones and activate the surround sound option in the Settings app (under Sound quality and effects), music sounds like it’s playing all around you. You can choose to listen to tracks balanced in front, from side to side or wide. I prefer wide. This feature makes each layer of a song sound distinct, even on a pair of cheap headphones. It’s awesome.The phone also supports Hi-Fi Quad DAC for experts with lossless audio files or who subscribe to Tidal’s Hi-Fi tier.LG released last year’s G6 with a processor that was quickly outmatched by a newer Snapdragon chip (835, at the time). The company didn’t make the same mistake twice.With Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 845 chip and 4GB of RAM, we expected the G7 to match the Galaxy S9, powered by the same processor and the same amount of RAM. The G7 is up there with the top-performing flagships in our benchmarking tests.On the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance, the G7 hit 8,566 — higher than both the Galaxy S9 (7,276) and the S9+, which has 6GB of RAM but clocked 8,295. The Mate 10 Pro (with a Kirin 970 processor) and Snapdragon 835-powered V30 are nowhere near as powerful, notching scores of 6,784 and 6,131, respectively.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowWith a dozen other apps open, I sailed my Subaru off ramps and easily cleared the tops of police cars in the graphically intensive Need for Speed: No Limits. Each race loaded quickly and my car responded instantly as I pressed a thumb to the screen to steer left or right. The G7’s Boombox speaker is a fun bonus when playing car-racing games, because the vibrations make the device feel like a steering wheel thrumming with the power of a souped-up engine. It’s an easy way to get a hit of adrenaline on a relaxing weekend afternoon.On 3DMark’s Sling Shot Extreme OpenGL ES 3.1, a demanding test of graphics performance, the G7 scored 4,201. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ were higher-performing with scores of 4,617 and 4,634, respectively.We also tested the G7’s performance using a real-world scenario, exporting a 2-minute 4K video file. The device took just 3 minutes and 16 seconds to handle that task. The Galaxy S9 was slower at 3:29 while the S9+, with its extra RAM, was faster at 2:32.Instead of creating its own voice-activated assistant to compete with Siri, Alexa or Bixby, LG went all-in with Google’s own Assistant. This was a good move. Beneath the G7’s volume rocker on its left edge is a dedicated button to summon the assistant without having to say “Hey Google.”Google Assistant is just as useful on the G7 as it is on other devices, such as the Pixel 2. The assistant can play music for you, give you the weather forecast, set reminders and timers, among other useful tasks. Google and LG teamed up on 32 commands specific to the G7, many of them camera-focused. You can ask Assistant to launch the AI Cam, or to take a photo in portrait mode. If you ask Assistant to take a photo, be ready to shoot — the camera gives you just three seconds before it clicks the shutter.I’m not sure the G7 really needs an Assistant-dedicated button, especially one that can’t be reprogrammed for other tasks (though LG says that may be possible in a future software update should enough people demand it), given that there are two other ways to summon Google Assistant. Saying “Hey Google” still works, and so does a long press on the home button. Pressing a physical button is no more convenient than those options.The G7 is shipping with Android 8.0 Oreo; LG says it will be upgradeable to Android P, rolling out later this year.LG’s flagship smartphones consistently fall short when it comes to battery life, and the G7 ThinQ is no exception. The phone’s 3,000 mAh battery should fall in line with the smartphone average of 9 hours and 50 minutes. In the Tom’s Guide Battery Test, continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile’s 4G LTE network, the G7 lasted 8 hours and 35 minutes.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeRival flagships such as the Galaxy S9, Mate 10 Pro and iPhone X all last hours longer than the G7 in our testing. The Mate 10 Pro still reigns supreme with its impressive 14:33 battery life.The G6 suffered from the same critical issue, lasting 8 hours and 39 minutes in our testing. The V30 turned in an even more pitiful performance, lasting just 6 hours and 30 minutes. LG includes a fast-charging cable in the box, which quickly juices the G7 back up to 100 percent, but a smartphone released in 2018 should have a long-lasting battery and support quick-charging, not force you to choose one or the other.LG must be frustrated. Past attempts at innovation, the modular G5 and the G6, which pushed smartphone cameras and displays forward, haven’t toppled Samsung. Meanwhile, Huawei’s camera technology and OnePlus’s vivid displays and affordable price are making those companies more competitive. So LG scaled back its ambitions with the G7, a flagship phone that follows in the footsteps of the company’s rivals.That’s not to say the G7 is a bad phone. But by taking the features that have made other flagships stand out and bundling them in one tidy package, LG isn’t doing anything to differentiate itself. The G7 is a fine phone. But it’s not a must-buy.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
187,Memteq 8-in-1 Camera Lens Kit,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/memteq-8-in-1-camera-lens-kit,review-5415.html","Most budget smartphone lens kits offer three lenses at most. Not so with Memteq's 8-in-1 kit, which includes a 0.65x macro and wide-angle, a 0.4x super wide-Angle, a 19x macro, two fisheye lenses (235 degrees and 180 degrees), a 2x telephoto and a CPL (circular polarizing lens). Unfortunately, quality was not on a par with quantity.It's great that Memteq provides so many choices you can go to extremes with for example, the 235-degree fisheye lens. Some of the lenses are very tiny, though, so you need to have nimble fingers to attach/detach them. (There's a small paper manual included with more details.)One of my main gripes with the design is that the lens caps are difficult to remove; so switching lenses takes a little longer than anticipated. And, it's easy to misplace the smaller optics if you're not careful.Despite some of the lenses being a little too small to handle easily, all are well- constructed from aluminum and should last a long time. I did, however, manage to scratch the back of one lens mount when I couldn't get it threaded on the clamp. But that didn't affect the lens' function or its ability to take pictures.MORE: Best iPhone Camera Lenses - Wide Angle, Macro & Zoom KitsThe kit also includes a lens clamp with rubberized grips to prevent damage to your cellphone, along with a drawstring pouch and a lens caps. Unfortunately, there are no back caps for the lenses, but we didn't notice any damage to the glass during regular use.Memteq's lenses are designed to work with a wide range of smartphones, including those from Apple and Samsung; we tested it using an iPhone 8.The kit comes with two wide-angle lenses: a 0.65x and a super-wide 0.4x. Both produced modestly sharp images in the center, but were blurry in the rest of the frame. Excessive blur and smudging was most noticeable on the upper left of the 0.4x lens when holding the smartphone vertically.Both wide-angle lenses also show some curvature. Of the two, the super-wide 0.4x lens produced more extreme distortion — verging on a modest fisheye field of view.Of Memteq's two fisheye lenses, the 180-degree model delivered a more sharply focused center, albeit one that was smaller than other budget fisheye lenses, such as VicTsing's.Memteq's 235-degree fisheye was generally soft throughout, and has such a wide field of view that my fingers would show up in the image if I wasn't careful. With both lenses, when the sun was inside (or just outside) the frame, there was significant lens flare and sun reflections.Memteq's macro lens is tiny and has a very low profile, so it takes patience and some finessing to get a focused image, especially with its very shallow depth of field.When photographing some shiny beads, for example, the only area that was in focus was a tiny portion of the string that showed between the beads.At its best, the 2x telephoto lens can produce a relatively sharp center area of focus, but becomes soft and blurry toward the perimeter. The outer areas also suffer from chromatic aberration and halos along high contrast edges.At its worst, the lens produces extreme pin cushioning (inward curvature of straight lines) when photographing subjects such as a door.A circular polarizing lens (CPL) seems like a nice addition to any lens kit. It's supposed to cut reflections off water and help darken skies — just turn the attachment until the filtered part of the CPL appears over the area of your choice.Unfortunately, there is barely any difference in images with and without the CPL; a photo of some trees and the blue sky beyond showed a marginal increase in contrast, but the effect was virtually nonexistent.For the price, Memteq gives you a wide range of lenses. Unfortunately, image quality doesn't live up to some of the other lens kits we've reviewed, such as the Aukey Ora and the Xenvo. While you'll have to spend a little more and give up some of the extra angles of the Memteq kit, ultimately you'll be better off.Credit: Tom's Guide"
188,Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/xiaomi-mi-mix-2s,review-5389.html","Those who hate the notch might just love the Mi Mix 2S, the latest premium smartphone from China's Xiaomi. While that name might be unfamiliar to most in the U.S., Xiaomi has garnered a worldwide reputation in recent years for innovative design, powerful hardware and low prices, even though the bulk of the company's products never make it out of Asia. And there's no better example of those traits in the company's portfolio than the Mi Mix series, which manages a mostly bezel-free look without relying on an unsightly notch.Like all of Xiaomi's wares, the Mi Mix 2S is technically unavailable on our shores. However, while most of Xiaomi's other phones lack support for Western networks, the Mi Mix 2S is a truly global device, with support for GSM networks everywhere, including AT&T and T-Mobile in the U.S.But here's the real question: Now that U.S. customers can finally use one of China's hottest phones, should they go through the trouble and expense of importing this device? Unique though the Mi Mix 2S inarguably is, it makes too many compromises for us to put it among the elite tier of Android mainstays, such as the Galaxy S9 and Pixel 2.The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S starts at 3,299 yuan, which translates to a little less than $530. For that, you get a device with 64GB of storage and 6GB of RAM. Additionally, there's a 128GB option with the same amount of RAM, as well as a 256GB model paired with 8GB of RAM that comes with a wireless charger, which we've tested here.In truth, $530 isn't bad, but you'll probably pay a little more depending on the vendor you choose for importing the phone. And therein lies the biggest problem with Mi Mix 2S ownership in the states: There’s no clear outlet that we or Xiaomi can direct you to to buy this device.This isn't a Huawei P20 situation, where the phone is sold in practically every other country. The path to buying that phone is as simple as going to the appropriate region of Amazon and checking the box for international shipping. The Mi Mix 2S is offered only in Asia for the time being, with limited sales in some European territories to follow at a later date. If you want one of these devices, your best bet is to visit one of the many retailers that specialize in importing such products, like Flipkart or HonorBuy, and try your luck there.Although it's hardly the only player anymore, Xiaomi is one of the originators of the bezel-less design trend that swept the smartphone industry over the past year.The first Mi Mix, released in November 2016, sported thin edges around three sides of the device, with a rather large chin at the bottom that housed the front-facing camera. The second generation repeats the same general aesthetic, with slightly more-rounded corners, which make the whole thing a bit more comfortable to hold.As you'd expect, forcing that camera down to the basement greatly affects the way you take selfies — but we'll elaborate on that later. In terms of design, though, that unconventional camera location allows the Mi Mix 2S to get by with a very minimal top bezel. There's just enough room for the earpiece straddling the seam between the glass front and aluminum frame, and it sounds surprisingly good in phone calls.Around the back of this device, Xiaomi distinguishes itself from the competition through the use of ceramic. The rear of the phone looks as though it's been dipped in a pool of dark silver, and the effect is more akin to that of fine jewelry rather than your run-of-the-mill handset. It's all set off with a dash of gold trim tastefully applied to the iPhone X-like vertical camera stack and fingerprint sensor. The elegant ""Mi Mix Designed by Xiaomi"" branding completes the look.Overall, the Mi Mix 2S bears more than a passing resemblance to one of our favorite-looking high-end handsets, the Essential Phone — albeit a bit softer and less monolithic. It's flattering to find yourself in such company, Xiaomi.But despite all that style, the Mi Mix 2S lacks creature comforts you'd expect from a phone of this price. There's no headphone jack. To make matters worse, although audio is piped out of both the bottom speaker and the earpiece, the latter sounds remarkably tinny when playing media. The Mi Mix 2S isn't water-resistant, and although it technically has NFC, our device didn't meet Google Pay's security standards — making tap-and-pay transactions a nonstarter.MORE: Xiaomi FAQ: What You Need to Know Before You BuyUpon checking with Xiaomi, we discovered the issue was caused by an unlocked bootloader on our our review unit, which we're told isn't the way these devices are supposed to ship to customers.In another similarity to the Essential Phone, Xiaomi opted not to include an OLED display, which you'll find in the iPhone X, Galaxy S9 and even the discontinued $499 OnePlus 5T. Instead, the Mi Mix 2S has a 6-inch LCD panel with full-HD+ resolution, more similar to the LG G7's screen.Like with so many LCD-touting phones, there's nothing strictly wrong with the Mi Mix 2S' screen. It's sharp and accurate enough, with the ability to reproduce an acceptable range of colors. But it lacks the punch and perfect blacks of Samsung's boundary-pushing AMOLED displays, not to mention the eye-searing brightness you get from Sony and Motorola's LCD-powered offerings.Stacked side by side with a Galaxy S9+ while playing the trailer for Avengers: Infinity War, the Mi Mix 2S underwhelmed, with muted hues and slightly poorer visibility in darker scenes. Look closely, and you'll see some light stippling that crops up on solid colors caused by the display's pixel matrix. Fine details, like the texture of Black Panther's suit, just weren't as crisp on the Mi Mix 2S.In terms of numbers, Xiaomi's flagship was again solid but nothing to challenge to status quo. The Mi Mix 2S topped out at a full-screen brightness of 441 nits. Colors were accurate, registering a Delta-E score of 0.28 (numbers closer to 0 are better), though saturation and temperature can be adjusted to taste on the Settings menu. The phone reproduced 124.4 percent of the sRGB color space, which is also satisfactory for an LCD panel. For comparison, the Galaxy S9 reached 630 nits and a 231-percent gamut, which is about as good as it gets among modern handsets.  The ""S"" in the name Mi Mix 2S stands for a few extras not found in the regular Mi Mix 2: an updated processor, wireless charging and, perhaps most importantly, a pair of dual cameras. (Previously, there was only one.) You'll find two 12-megapixel shooters on the back of Xiaomi's flagship: a main one with an f/1.8 aperture and a secondary telephoto at f/2.4.But that's not all, because like so many phones marketed on the strength of their photo-taking prowess, the Mi Mix 2S' cameras are smart. Xiaomi has followed in the footsteps of Huawei and LG with its new AI Camera feature that allows the device to recognize scenes and adjust settings appropriately on the fly.To see what the Mi Mix 2's new duo of lenses could do, I took it, along with the dual-lens Galaxy S9+, out into the wild. Despite the overcast skies, both Xiaomi and Samsung's phones impressed capturing this tranquil scene in a Pennsylvania state park.The Mi Mix 2 demonstrates punchier colors and more-realistic contrast in comparison to the washed-out hues produced by the Galaxy S9+. But then again, the sharper S9+ nails the finer details, like the ripples of water down the stream and the sediment along the banks of the creek. The two phones excel in different areas, so it's tough to pick a winner.These portraits tell a similar story. Both devices clearly opt for different styles; the Galaxy's is more dramatic, with deeper shadows in comparison to the Mi Mix 2S' more natural, muted exposure. Again, there's this slight fuzziness to Xiaomi's rendition, most evident as you zoom in on the model's denim jacket. But this is another case in which the choice of a winner is simply a matter of preference.However, that changed as the afternoon wore on. These close-ups of moss on the side of a tree taken with each device's telephoto lens favor the Galaxy S9+ in a big way. While the Mi Mix 2S pulled out its foliage filter to pump up the saturation here, I wouldn't say the result worked to Xiaomi's advantage. The moss should have been a lush mix of greens and yellows, not straight-up emerald. The Mi Mix 2S' take lacks nuance, depth and detail. It also could have used some of the blur the Galaxy S9+ expertly applied to the foreground.The Mi Mix 2S saved its worst performance by far for the low-light round. Xiaomi's device delivered a muddy mess of a shot back in our office. The photo resembled something you'd get out of a budget prepaid handset from five years ago rather than the work of an ostensibly state-of-the-art flagship. The Mi Mix 2S was no competition for the Galaxy S9+, which captured the small plant with remarkable clarity and no noise in sight.What about that 8-MP front-facing camera? I know — it looks awful, not unlike the ""nose cams"" adorning many laptops in recent years. Thankfully, though, because the Mi Mix 2S is a phone and not a computer, this camera placement is not that bad. Just turn the device upside down before snapping a selfie, and the screen will flip, too. It's not ideal but far from the worst-case scenario.As for the images the front camera produces, those are a different story. The Mi Mix 2S' front-facing camera couldn't reconcile the gray sky, leading to a dreary portrait and very blown-out clouds. The Galaxy S9+ suffered from a similar problem, but the extra dash of color in my face and the background lifts the frame in a much-needed way.We're smack dab in the middle of smartphone season, which means you can expect new devices to up the ante for performance until the end of the year. For now, though, Xiaomi can claim the title as most powerful Android handset in the world.That's mostly thanks to the Snapdragon 845 chipset inside, which by itself is already a very capable slice of silicon. But the Mi Mix 2S is one of the first 845-powered products to also feature an optional 8GB of RAM, rather than 4GB or 6GB, as in the Galaxy S9 and S9+, respectively. And that makes the difference between a fast phone and a reallyfast phone.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowOur 8GB Mi Mix 2S edged out the Galaxy S9+ in Geekbench 4, a benchmark that measures overall performance, There, Xiaomi's device turned in a score of 8,377, compared to Samsung's 8,295. That's a slight but noteworthy difference, because the extra RAM means the Mi Mix 2S can juggle more apps running concurrently without experiencing slowdown.Surprisingly, however, the Mi Mix 2S' strong showing didn't carry over to 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme graphics test. The phone managed only 3,248 in the OpenGL ES 3.1 portion of the benchmark, while the Galaxy S9+ notched 4,617.It's hard to say why the Mi Mix 2S underperformed in 3DMark, as this phone carries the very same Adreno 630 GPU found in Samsung's flagship. What's even stranger, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Mobile ran just as smoothly on the Mi Mix 2S as it did on the Galaxy S9+. In any case, having gamed with the phone, we don't believe the numbers are worth sweating; the Mi Mix 2S is a top performer.The 3,400-mAh battery inside the Mi Mix 2S lasted 10 hours and 15 minutes after streaming web pages on T-Mobile LTE. That's just above the 9:50 average for smartphones.It's a good result, but not quite as good as those from other top-line devices, like the 11-hour Galaxy S9+, the 12-hour Google Pixel 2 XL or the astonishingly long-lasting Huawei Mate 10 Pro, which called it quits after 14 hours and 39 minutes.While we didn't have the Mi Mix 2S' stock adapter on hand to perform a charging-speed test, Xiaomi did provide Tom's Guide with one of the company's own wireless charging pads, which come packaged with the 256GB model. Clad in white silicone with a minimalist look, Xiaomi's 7.5A pad takes the Mi Mix 2S from empty to full in about 3 hours. That's hardly a pinch, but then again, the pad is quite inexpensive, costing the equivalent of $15 when bought alone.Because both the Mi Mix 2S and the wireless charger operate on the Qi standard (the same used on Apple's latest iPhones), you can use any Qi pad in place of the Xiaomi one. Some of them are more powerful than Xiaomi's stock pad and will top up the handset faster. Here are some of our favorites.Welcome to Android as you've never seen it before. Although the Mi Mix 2S comes equipped with Android 8.0 Oreo, Google's operating system looks and runs completely differently here than on other handsets, and that's because of Xiaomi's MIUI interface.MIUI has actually been around for a very long time — seven years, in fact, which means it predates Xiaomi's own phones. Back then, MIUI was pitched as an alternative to stock Android that provided devices like the original Motorola Droid with a user experience more akin to that of iOS. MIUI didn't even support the Google Play store, then known as the Android Market.Fast-forward to 2018, and MIUI now launches on all of Xiaomi's hardware. The design — which was once heavily inspired by Apple's flair for skeuomorphism, realistic textures and 3D buttons — is flatter and more minimalist to emulate the iOS of today. More importantly, the Play Store is on board.I have to hand it to Xiaomi for accomplishing something I've long thought impossible: creating an Android skin I actually don't hate using. Many of the same features offered by other manufacturers, like the ability to duplicate apps and create ""secret"" alternate user profiles, appear in MIUI as well. However, Xiaomi's interface feels cohesive in a way most custom takes on Android don't.For one thing, the extra functionality is typically useful and never feels tacked on. I like the iPhone X-style gestures that Xiaomi offers as an alternative to Android's traditional navigation bar. I also like the weather widget thoughtfully included above the quick toggles in the notification shade.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialThose are the kind of little quality-of-life improvements that MIUI offers, and they mesh well with the simplistic, airy and clean aesthetic Xiaomi's established for this phone. It's not for Android purists, nor do I prefer it to the Pixel 2's software. However, MIUI is a stylish departure from tradition that should excite users pining for something that doesn't feel totally like Android or iOS.For updates, Xiaomi takes a different approach than other manufacturers. The company tells us its Chinese customers are more concerned with getting the latest edition of MIUI, rather than Android updates. For that reason, Xiaomi phones typically receive only one major Android version upgrade during the devices' life spans, while they get up to five or six years of new MIUI software. However, with Google streamlining the Android update process through Project Treble, Xiaomi says it's currently reconsidering its practices.There's a lot to like about the Mi Mix 2S. While the greatest minds at other phone makers are busy aping the iPhone X's notch, Xiaomi set down its own path. This is one of the prettiest handsets of the year thus far and likely will remain in that conversation through the end of 2018.In terms of performance, the Mi Mix 2S is similarly admirable. But right now, Xiaomi's range-topper mostly benefits from Samsung's exclusive hold on the Snapdragon 845 chip here in the U.S. Once that subsides, as it will in the coming weeks with handsets like the Sony Xperia XZ2 and Asus ZenFone 5Z, Xiaomi's advantage will surely erode.That leaves us with a beautiful phone capable of excellent performance that U.S. buyers will soon be able to get elsewhere, whose other qualities aren't necessarily knocks against it but don't impress, either. The iPhone X and Pixel 2 XL outclass the Mi Mix 2S' hit-or-miss dual cameras, while the Galaxy S9 duo offers far better screens and a more extensive feature set, with water resistance, a microSD card slot and booming stereo speakers. The OnePlus 6 — which hasn't been announced yet — will also bring Snapdragon 845 power and will likely compare favorably in terms of price, if history is a good predictor.One day, the Mi Mix 2S might be sold in these parts. Xiaomi already has a small presence in the U.S., selling assorted tech products on Amazon, and CEO Lei Jun has gone on record saying he'd like to add phones to that roster by the end of this year or early next. If that plan pans out, the Mi Mix 2S would make for quite a premiere, especially if Xiaomi can keep the price down.But that's not the reality. The Mi Mix 2S doesn't contend with the best devices in its class, and prospective buyers have to jump through too many hoops just to get their hands on one. It's interesting, but simply too inconvenient to recommend.Credits: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
189,Blu R2,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blu-r2,review-5326.html","Even the least expensive phone isn't much of a bargain if it doesn't offer anything other than a low price tag. And that's the problem with the $110 Blu R2, an attractively priced smartphone that, upon closer examination, doesn't offer you much for your money.Blu's R2 is available unlocked on Amazon starting at $110 for the base model with 16GB of onboard storage and 2GB of RAM, depending on which color you pick. Somehow, black is the most expensive option at $115, but you can also choose from silver, gold and rose gold. You can use the R2 on GSM networks, including AT&T, T-Mobile and prepaid carriers such as Cricket, MetroPCS and Straight Talk. The R2 isn't compatible with Verizon or Sprint.Looking at the R2, it's impossible to see it as anything other than just another smartphone.There is nothing at all remarkable about its design, except maybe how dated it looks.The R2 has thick bezels surrounding its 5.2-inch display, and it's unclear exactly why they are so large. The bottom chin below the display lacks any buttons or sensors, yet it's as thick as the bottom bezel on an iPhone 5. The top bezel houses the camera lens, flash and speaker, but those take up very little real estate, compared to the space they're given.Then there's the micro USB port, which is located at the top right of the phone's frame instead of at bottom center, like on most other phones. The headphone jack is also on the top, but to the left of the charging port. This positioning is bizarre — quirky just for the sake of quirkiness.Otherwise, the R2 looks identical to its slightly larger sibling, the Blu R2 Plus. The R2's smaller footprint — it's a 5.2-inch phone to the R2 Plus' 5.5-inch size — makes the fingerprint sensor on the rear easier to reach for people with small hands, which is a bonus. But like the R2 Plus, the R2 looks like any run-of-the-mill Android phone, circa 2015. If you care about style, look elsewhere.The R2's diminutive display is surrounded by chunky bezels, which prevents it from being truly immersive. But its colors are bright and accurate, even if they don't offer the richness and saturation you'll find in a more expensive phone.The sizable bezels on both sides of the display made watching the latest Solo: A Star Wars Story trailer on YouTube a constricting experience for me, but the snowy landscapes and galactic battles were colorful and clear.MORE: 15 Cheap Android Smartphones (Under $200) Ranked Best to WorstThe smaller R2's display feels a little bit constricted, compared to its larger sibling. The R2 Plus sports a 5.5-inch 1080p panel, while the 5.2-inch R2 features a 720p LCD display. The lower-res display is also not as bright, reaching 445 nits, compared to the larger version's 481 nits. It covered 109.9 percent of the sRGB color gamut, compared to the 5.5-inch's 119.2 percent range. The displays are neck and neck when it comes to the Delta-E color accuracy test, at 0.35 and 0.38 for the R2 Plus and the R2, respectively. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)The R2's 13-megapixel rear-facing lens and 13-MP front-facing camera are more impressive than they have any right to be for a phone that costs around $100. The R2's front lens in particular captures far more detailed selfies than any other sub-$200 smartphone I've used, with accurate colors to boot.The R2 captured the contrast of my red lace top against the teal of my living room chair and managed to make my skin look like it normally does. Similarly priced smartphones such as the Moto E4 make my skin look a little grainy (or go a little heavy-handed on the beauty filter to make your skin look like a weird, glowy alien). The R2 turns out selfies I wouldn't be embarrassed to post on Instagram (#nofilter).The R2 sports the same rear-camera system as the R2 Plus, which fared well in our tests against budget Android rivals such as the Moto G5 Plus.The G5 captures colors more accurately, as evidenced in a photo of freshly planted daffodils in Bryant Park. The flowers are more vibrantly yellow, the stalks more green and the cement more blue-gray, like they are in real life. The Blu R2 captures more muted colors.There's just no getting around it: A $110 phone is going to suffer when it comes to performance, and that's exactly where the R2's low price tag is most evident.The device, which runs on a MediaTek MT6737 processor, scored a paltry 1,583 on the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance. Even its low-performing sibling, the larger R2 Plus, scored higher (2,319), thanks to a slightly better processor and 3GB of RAM. The $99 Moto E4, which costs less and has a slightly faster chipset, scored 1,711. If you spend a little more and get the Moto G5 Plus, which can be had for as low as $205 on Amazon, it's more than twice as fast as the R2, with a Geekbench score of 3,746.Forget about scores for a second, though: I could feel the phone struggling as I surfed around the web, and it struggled to play YouTube trailers. A teaser for HBO's Westworld took more than a minute to come through clearly.MORE: Can You Trust Cheap Chinese Phones with Your Privacy?The same applies to games. The R2 scored a 4,469 on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test, compared to the impressive 13,862 performance of the G5 Plus.I tried to play a round of the popular car-racing game Asphalt 8 and kept crashing my Dodge Dart GT. That was after I installed the app, which took a half hour, and I was able to load my race through the Nevada desert, which took a minute. The phone lagged as I tilted it back and forth to weave my way around other cars racing down the highway. If you want to play something more intensive than Tetris, you'll need a more powerful phone.Some budget phones pack in supersized batteries to make up for their underwhelming designs and just OK performance. The R2 offers a decently sized 3,000-mAh battery, but that doesn't translate to a longer-lasting phone.The R2 lasted just 8 hours and 59 minutes in Tom's Guide's Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network. That's better than the R2 Plus, which lasted just 7 hours and 56 minutes, even with the same 3,000-mAh battery that's in the smaller R2. This race to the bottom is a waste of time for phone buyers, especially when so many budget phones can outlast the 9:50 of the average smartphone these days.The Blu R2 has a decent display and better-than-expected cameras for its $110 price tag. But when it comes to performance, design and battery life, you can easily find an affordable Android phone that offers a better return for your minimal investment and has a chance of being upgraded to Oreo, the latest version of Android. The R2 is still running an old version of Nougat.If you have less than $200 to spend, the $99 Moto E4, $150 Moto G5 Plus and $199 Honor 7X all offer a better experience than the R2. Honor's phone even looks like a pricier device, with an edge-to-edge display and dual-lens camera system.In the competitive budget Android market, there's no reason to spend money on a phone like the Blu R2, which offers just the bare minimum.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
190,Nuu Mobile G3,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/nuu-mobile-g3,review-5318.html","What a difference a couple of months makes. Back in February, we reviewed the X5, a device from Chinese smartphone startup Nuu Mobile. Unfortunately, we found it difficult to recommend, due to its dated design and so-so hardware compared to a host of very compelling $200 alternatives.Now Nuu is back with yet another $200 handset — and straightaway, you can tell it looks to be quite a step up from other phones in Nuu's lineup. While it's safe to say Nuu's latest is a more compelling choice for bargain hunters than the X5, the G3 falls short of the standard for affordable-yet-capable handsets, where the Huawei Honor 7X and Moto G5 Plus reign supreme.You can get the Nuu Mobile G3  directly from the company as well as from Amazon for $199. The device is GSM unlocked, meaning it will only work with certain networks, including T-Mobile, AT&T, MetroPCS and Cricket Wireless. The G3 comes exclusively in blue, and contains 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage with a microSD slot offering up to 128GB of expansion.On its website, Nuu calls the G3 ""a trendsetter in design and technology."" Normally I ignore grandiose marketing claims, but I couldn't shake this one off, precisely because Nuu's ""trendsetter"" is the most shameless Galaxy S8 clone you'll find this side of the Pacific.But is it at least a well-built clone? For the most part, yes. Set the G3 down next to one of Samsung's recent flagships, and you'll inevitably find yourself in a game of ""I Spy"" as you try to spot all the differences. Nuu's phone has no answer for the Galaxy's Infinity Display or superthin bezels, but it's still a faithful approximation — right down to the antenna lines and drilled speaker holes, which have exactly the same shape and placement as those on the S8.Flip the G3 over and you'll find a shimmering plate of glass interrupted only by a vertically oriented pair of cameras and a fingerprint sensor. The deep shade of blue has a strong metallic effect that concentrates light into vertical streaks, like laser beams. Some may find it eye-catching, while others will likely dismiss it as gaudy.Still, there's one aspect of Samsung's design in particular that Nuu should have copied: the headphone jack. We're accustomed to seeing flagships routing audio through their USB Type-C ports, but it's very rare to see that in a $199 device.If you're eyeing the G3 for its bargain price, you probably won't be enthusiastic about having to take the cash you saved by buying this cheaper phone, only to have to shell it out on an expensive pair of earbuds or cans with the proper modern connector. It's a decision that really flies in the face of the market Nuu is courting here.While Nuu's G3 may have an extra-wide, 5.7-inch LCD display, the screen isn't terribly sharp. The 1440 x 720 resolution translates to a pixel density of about 283 pixels per inch, which results in a blurrier picture than what you get from other $200 phones that are about the same size.Strangely enough, though, the low resolution might not be the most objectionable thing about this display. Like so many other 18:9 phones released over the past year, the G3's screen features rounded corners, which is fine. The issue is the way Nuu tried to achieve the effect.The display itself is actually a standard rectangle, but it's viewed beneath a cutout with a thick, black border that unsuccessfully tries to conceal those sharp edges. What you get is diagonal lines rather than smooth curves, and the whole thing ends up being quite the eyesore.Weird corners aside, the G3's panel isn't anything special. Colors tend to be washed out and cool. They aren't particularly accurate, either, as the phone's Delta-E score of 1.41 confirmed. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) For reference, the Honor 7X was much more correctly calibrated, at 0.38.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesThese days, even the least expensive handsets achieve proper color representation, so it was somewhat surprising to see Nuu's latest falter here. Nevertheless, the display is at least bright, posting a peak of 558 nits when we measured it with a light meter. That's far and away better than the 433-nit smartphone average. It also captured 118.8 percent of the sRGB color space, which is right in line with rivals.Dual cameras are so ubiquitous now, it seems harder to find a phone without them than the other way around. Sure enough, the Nuu Mobile G3 combines a 13-megapixel, f/2.0 main sensor with another 5-MP shooter, allowing for portraits with background bokeh effects.Cameras in budget phones rarely impress, but even with that caveat, the G3's are remarkably inconsistent. You never quite know how they're going to respond to certain scenarios. Take the above shot of a fruit stand, for example, where the G3 renders a box of oranges in an eye-searing neon hue that actually hurts your eyes to look at for extended periods of time.For comparison's sake, I captured the same scene with the Honor 7X's 16-MP shooter. Although it looks washed out side by side, I can't tell if Nuu's device spoiled my palate here.For the next round of photos, the G3 dialed back the saturation. In fact, this image outside our New York City building is so washed out, it definitely could have used a tinge of warmth in the walls, ceiling and gold trim around the windows. The entire frame is hazy and blown out, such that you can't even read the text on the sign near the revolving doors the way you can with the Honor 7X's effort.With two comparisons that swung decidedly in the Honor 7X's favor — and yielded wildly different results — I certainly didn't expect the G3 to pull out a better low-light shot in our office.This scene would challenge even the best smartphone cameras, and predictably, both the Nuu and Honor struggled to reconcile the harsh light breaking in from the windows with the relatively dim area of focus between. Although the G3 didn't nail the sharpness, it exposed the center much better and pulled more color out of the plant and the pots.My colleague Jorge struck a dramatic pose to test out the G3's dual-lens Portrait Mode. There are aspects I like about the way Nuu's camera tech processed this photo. The G3 did a better job of isolating Jorge's face from the background, without letting the overaggressive bokeh bleed into the foreground, as it did on the Honor 7X's attempt. But the G3's rendition is mostly blown out once again, with highlights from the left half of the frame casting a cloudiness that permeates everything.Nuu's phone was also frustrating to shoot with, thanks to a stubborn autofocus that repeatedly locked on and released numerous times before actually taking the shot.The G3's 13-MP, front-facing shooter at least provides sharp and relatively accurate selfies — just don't expect it to work any miracles. The Honor 7X has a preference for warmer, more dramatic tones, but with only 8 megapixels to work with, it doesn't reach the same clarity as the G3 and employs a filter that makes the end result look overprocessed — even if its self-portrait isn't as dim as what the G3 shot.At $200, you expect smooth, if not stunning, performance from a phone, and the G3 mostly holds up its end of the bargain. The device is powered by MediaTek's Helio P25 system on chip, which is about on par with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor that appears in many midrange phones.It's the G3's 4GB of RAM that really shines, though. Most handsets at this price feature half that amount, or maybe 3GB if you're lucky. But 4GB is flagship territory, and it means Nuu's bargain doesn't struggle flipping between apps running in the background, or drawing the home screen after particularly intensive tasks. That said, app open times aren't always the speediest — the worst offender was Gmail, which took as many as 6 seconds to populate my inbox.Solid as the G3 is, it's important to recognize that it's not top dog in the segment. For example, the Snapdragon 625-powered Moto G5 Plus smoked the G3 in both the Geekbench 4 overall test and 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test, posting respective scores of 3,746 and 13,862 to the G3's 2,221 and 12,802. Even the Honor 7X, which features a Huawei-built Kirin 659 CPU, delivered a slightly more stable frame rate playing off-road racer Asphalt Xtreme, and that device actually placed behind the G3 by about 1,000 points in the 3DMark comparison.The Nuu Mobile G3 put in exactly 10 hours of work in our battery test, where the phone endlessly loaded web pages in Chrome over T-Mobile's LTE network.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThat's solid longevity from a 3,000-mAh battery pack, and it compares favorably to the Honor 7X (9:21) and the average smartphone (9:50). The Moto G5 Plus lasts an hour and a half longer, though, and if you really prize battery life, the Asus ZenFone 4 Max and Moto E4 Plus cost the same or less than the G3, and both lasted around 15 hours.Nuu didn't fuss around with Android much on the G3 at all, and it's a better device for it. However, there are a few caveats there.First off, it comes with version 7.1.1 Nougat, not 8.0 Oreo. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be surprising; most budget phones never launch with the latest release of Android, nor do they see regular updates. However, Nuu has gone on the record and said that the G3 would see Oreo in March. With March having come and gone and still no sign of new software, I wouldn't cling to the company's word.The other issue is quite a strange one. Nuu relied upon Google for the majority of its stock apps on the G3, which is a commendable approach. Yet the phone's browser is an outlier. While Chrome is on board, it's accompanied by a modified version of Chromium — an open-source program that provides the framework Chrome is built upon.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialThe reason for Chromium's existence on the G3 was initially unclear to me, until I typed a query in the search bar. Unlike Chrome, Nuu's customized version of Chromium employs a different search engine with less relevant results, and more ads and clickbait in a section titled Today's News. The clickbait in particular comes courtesy of content aggregator Taboola, which recently announced a partnership with ZTE to push a dedicated app in that company's phones.In this age of fake news, it's difficult to imagine a more tone-deaf initiative than the one Nuu has opted for here. Frustratingly, the company has even omitted the option to change the search engine in the stock browser — yet another reason why one of the first things any G3 owner should do is disable Chromium, replacing it with Chrome in the home screen dock.When there are so many solid phones pushing quality hardware and software for around $200, you have to turn away a lot of alternatives to settle on the Nuu Mobile G3.Shameless copycat looks aside, the G3 is a competent device with competitive specs and respectable battery life. But it lacks polish across the board. The screen is low-res and inaccurate, the performance isn't quite as swift as it might seem on paper and the dual cameras are underwhelming, even for a budget product. Plus, the prospect of getting Android updates appears to be dicey until Nuu makes good on earlier promises.Years ago, you might have overlooked those faults to get a phone for such an attractive price. Today, there's no need — between the best that Motorola, Honor and ZTE offer, you can do better than this Galaxy doppelganger.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
191,Asus ZenFone Max Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/zenfone-max-plus,review-5297.html","Last fall's Asus ZenFone 4 Max was a mostly middle-of-the-road handset that managed to stand out with a beefy, 5,000-mAh battery that lasted well over 15 hours in testing. Now, less than six months later, the company has returned with a half-step of sorts.It's not a phone in the upcoming ZenFone 5 line (those devices will roll out between now and the summer), but an iteration of the ZenFone 4 Max called the ZenFone Max Plus. This new model brings a modern, 18:9 display and faster performance in a similar body. Curiously though, Asus shrank the battery. Is the trade-off worth it? Nope.The ZenFone Max Plus is available for $229 unlocked direct from Asus, as well as third-party retailers including Amazon, Newegg and Best Buy. That's $30 more than the ZenFone 4 Max.For that, you get 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, though the latter can be expanded to 2TB via a microSD card. The device supports only GSM networks, which means you'll have to subscribe to a network like T-Mobile, AT&T, Cricket Wireless or MetroPCS to use this phone.Asus' ZenFone 4 series was seemingly designed to be as unrecognizable as possible, mixing a grab bag of generic cues found on other, similarly forgettable handsets. The ZenFone Max Plus does very little to change that, though there is one key difference.The ZenFone Max Plus improves upon its predecessors with a 5.7-inch, 18:9 display and much slimmer bezels at the top and bottom. The panel itself sports curved corners and sits much more suitably on the phone's face, which no longer features a dated rectangular fingerprint sensor/home button sandwiched between capacitive navigation keys.These are subtle changes, but they're welcome. The wider screen means you get more real estate given the size of the chassis, and the narrower bezels put it all within fingers' reach.Around the back, the differences are harder to spot: There’s a rear-facing fingerprint sensor where there wasn't one before, centrally-located on the aluminum shell. The dual cameras are bisected by recessed chrome trim that returns from the ZenFone 4 Max Plus and looks old hat at this point. Alas, this is still a budget smartphone that evokes other budget smartphones. Water resistance is again nowhere to be found, though at least the headphone jack remains.There was nothing at all noteworthy about the 720p, 5.5-inch LCD display in the ZenFone 4 Max, never mind that it felt positively ancient by even last year's standards. Thankfully, Asus has seriously upgraded the screen for the ZenFone Max Plus in every dimension. While it's still an LCD panel, the size has been bumped up to 5.7 inches, it employs a wider aspect ratio, and, best of all, it touts full HD+ resolution.This was an area that desperately needed addressing from the last go-round, and we're glad Asus tended to the issue. However, that's not to say the new ZenFone's display is any more remarkable than competing LCD units.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowFor one thing, it's quite dim. With a peak brightness of 377 nits, the ZenFone Max Plus is outperformed by not only its predecessor, which achieved 461 nits, but many other handsets as well. Take the $199 Honor 7X, for example, which topped out at 510 nits, or the similarly priced Moto G5 Plus at 591 nits.In terms of color gamut and reproduction, the ZenFone Max Plus fares a bit better. Our unit reproduced 119.5 percent of the sRGB color space and registered a Delta-E accuracy score of 0.34. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) Those results are par for the course at this price range, but because the ZenFone Max Plus doesn't give users the option of alternate display profiles, you won't be able to tune the experience to suit your preference.Like so many budget phones with flagship-photography aspirations, the ZenFone Max Plus comes fitted with two cameras on the back: a 16-megapixel main sensor with f/2.0 aperture and a secondary wide-angle 8-MP shooter that lacks autofocus. Above the display is another 8MP lens for selfies.I snapped a handful of comparison shots with our unit and an Honor 7X — the latter of which costs $199 but also comes with a pair of shooters that enable dramatic portraits with blurred backgrounds.Starting outside New York's Penn Station in the misty, early hours of the morning, the ZenFone Max Plus derived robust color from the scene with a slightly warmer white balance than the Honor 7X delivered. However, the ZenFone's HDR mode was finicky and frustrating to shoot with; the multiple exposures taken in quick succession made the ZenFone's camera very susceptible to blurring. The Honor 7X delivered a sharper and brighter exposure by comparison.Next, I ventured to Bryant Park, where I captured a few images of flowers that again illustrated a clear advantage in favor of Honor's budget handset. The shot from the ZenFone is dim and a bit hazy when you zoom in. The toned-down shades of lavender in the petals are probably more realistic, but then again, Asus' camera failed to convey texture and depth the same way Honor's could.To test out the ZenFone's Portrait Mode, I enlisted the help of my colleague Caitlin. Because neither device has a telephoto lens, the perspectives were very drawn out. That means you'll have to get extremely close to the subject with both of these phones to take anything that looks remotely like the portraits produced by the iPhone X or Galaxy S9+.The bokeh effect out of the ZenFone was significantly more pronounced than on the Honor 7X. It was so strong, and blurred so much of the frame aside from Caitlin's face, that it ended up looking like a photo of a miniature model, or a macro shot with the tilt-shift effect you get when shooting really small objects. Plain and simple, it was excessive compared to the totally serviceable, natural portrait courtesy of the Honor 7X.A pair of selfies rounds out the comparison. Interestingly, the Honor 7X makes it look like the sun was out when I snapped the photo, with its warmer tones and brighter exposure. I'd go so far as to say the ZenFone's rendition is more realistic and crisper as you zoom in; then again, when it comes to selfies, realism tends to take a back seat to whatever makes you look better, and Asus' handset didn't do that here.The MediaTek MT6750T system-on-chip inside the ZenFone Max Plus is quite an outdated piece of technology. Released in 2016 and manufactured on a 28-nanometer process, it can't match the power or efficiency of Qualcomm's newer 14-nm 600-series chipsets or the equivalent Kirin 659 featured in the Honor 7X.Unfortunately, that puts Asus' phone at a sizeable disadvantage. In benchmarks, the ZenFone Max Plus fared no better or worse than the ZenFone 4 Max and its Snapdragon 430 silicon. The newer ZenFone delivered a Geekbench 4 score of 2,610, meaning it's virtually the same as the outgoing model in overall performance.The trouble with Asus' proposal is that you get so much more from competing products. The ZenFone Max Plus handled casual games like N.O.V.A Legacy and SimCity BuildIt smoothly enough, but gamers on a budget would be wise to choose either the Honor 7X or Moto G5 Plus instead. Both of those phones cost $30 less than the ZenFone Max Plus, yet scored anywhere from 2,000 to 4,300 points higher in 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics gauntlet.There were fairly common occasions when the ZenFone Max Plus didn't feel as snappy as it should have, like when thumbing between tabs in Chrome or even returning to the home screen from the Settings menu. Sometimes, it's a matter of choppy animations; other times, the phone sits motionless for a half-second before following through on your commands. Three years ago, this would have been expected for a $229 phone, but these days, there's no need to settle.Despite widening the screen, Asus shrank the battery inside the ZenFone Max Plus, down from a whopping 5,000 mAh in the ZenFone 4 Max to 4,130 mAh. While the downsizing betrays the ""Max"" brand, this screen is still pretty generously sized in the grand scheme of things — which makes it all the more confusing why the Max Plus lasted nearly 4 hours less than its predecessor in our testing.That's right: The newest ZenFone called it quits after 11 hours and 25 minutes of marathon website streaming on T-Mobile LTE. For perspective, the ZenFone 4 Max delivered 15 hours and 19 minutes of battery life.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThe Galaxy S9 has only a 3,000-mAh battery, and that phone achieved 11 hours on the dot. Testing the Max Plus again didn't help things, as it mustered only 10 hours and 17 minutes the second time around.Aside from the physical size of the battery, two factors could explain the Max Plus' surprising performance. First and foremost is the MediaTek chipset, which is older and not as renowned for its efficiency as Qualcomm's 400-series silicon. Additionally, it's critical to remember that the new ZenFone also has a bigger, higher-resolution screen than the previous ZenFone 4 Max, which is obviously going to put more of a strain on the battery.Disappointing longevity aside, Asus has baked a lot of functionality into the ZenFone Max Plus' battery. There's a reverse-charging mode, as well as the ability to prolong the health of the pack with a setting in the included Power Master app.The Double Battery Lifespan feature is designed to prevent the battery from degrading as quickly, at the expense of less usage time per charge. It's difficult to judge the long-term effectiveness of this system in our short time with the phone, but given this device's relatively underwhelming battery life to begin with, it's something I would think twice about before turning on.Although Asus has made good on its promise to deliver Android 8.0 Oreo to select ZenFone 4 models, the ZenFone Max Plus strangely launches with version 7.0 Nougat. This isn't a clean rendition of Google's OS either; it's filtered through Asus' ZenUI interface.That's going to disappoint some Android purists. Not only does ZenUI look very different from the stock experience, but it doesn't add a great deal of value either.Sure, you get Asus' Mobile Manager app, which provides a one-stop shop to various device-maintenance controls, like the aforementioned battery-saving modes and a system scan that can help identify ways to improve device performance. But many Android phones these days come with similar features, and if they weren't there, you wouldn't be any worse for wear.The new ZenFone's interface is cluttered, too. ZenUI commits that cardinal sin of so many manufacturer skins, putting forth an overwhelming number of quick toggles in the notification shade for things that either don't belong there (like multiwindow mode) or that you probably won't use very often (like sharing location reports over email and SMS).To make matters worse, settings often aren't stowed away where you'd expect to find them. I overturned seemingly every rock to try and find a way to turn on some form of quick-launch gesture for the camera, only to locate it in a sub-menu titled Asus Customized Settings — whatever that means.As similar as many phones look and feel these days, there's typically one quality you can point to that a handset does particularly well, that differentiates it from its competitors. Unfortunately, I'm struggling to find it in the ZenFone Max Plus.Asus made its long-lasting budget proposition much prettier, but destroyed the phone's greatest asset. The ZenFone 4 Max was remarkable for its battery life, but with that diminished, there's no other reason to consider the Max Plus.Yes, the screen is larger and the bezels are smaller, but everyone's doing that nowadays. The camera hasn't been appreciably improved, and the performance has actually taken a step back in a few respects. The software is still outdated and both functionally and aesthetically inferior to stock Android. Yet, despite all these faults, this phone is more expensive than the model it was designed to iterate upon.For my money, I'd rather buy the $199 Honor 7X and the recently discounted Moto G5 Plus. You could even upgrade to the Moto G5S Plus, which adds dual cameras, for just $20 more than the latest ZenFone.That makes the choice pretty clear. The ZenFone Max Plus is the right phone for literally no one.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
192,Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/sony-xperia-xa2-ultra,review-5289.html","Recent smartphones from Sony have saddled otherwise powerful and pleasing-to-use smartphones with outdated designs and a lack of critical features. Its last flagship device, the Xperia XZ1, was a perfect example; although we loved shooting with its super slow-motion camera, it was incredibly bulky to hold and didn't even come with a fingerprint sensor.Sony's new midrange offering, the Xperia XA2 Ultra, attempts to right some of those wrongs. For one, there's actually a working fingerprint sensor on the back. And although the XA2 Ultra still has a conventional 16:9 display, the bezels have been trimmed a hair, yet are still wide enough to support dual front-facing cameras.Unfortunately, it's not enough. The XA2 Ultra simply feels like more of the same. Worst of all, at $449, it's far too expensive for what you get.The Xperia XA2 Ultra is the larger version of Sony's 5.2-inch $349 Xperia XA2, and retails for $449. For that, you get Qualcomm's snapdragon 630 processor mated to 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage with a microSD slot. The phone is available GSM unlocked, making it compatible with the likes of AT&T and T-Mobile, but not Verizon and Sprint. You can pick it up from Best Buy, B&H and Amazon.Sony's upcoming flagships, the Xperia XZ2 and XZ2 Compact, figure to bring the design overhaul the company's mobile lineup so desperately needs. But until they launch later in the year, we're simply left with the XA2 Ultra in all its cumbersome glory.Weighing a little less than 8 ounces and measuring 6.4 inches tall and 3.1 inches wide, the XA2 Ultra is bigger than Samsung's Galaxy S9+ in every dimension, except for active screen real estate. Although Sony's 6-inch display may seem more manageable on paper than the 6.2-inch panel on the S9+, the Xperia's traditional 16:9 aspect ratio makes it squatter but infinitely more difficult to reach across. This is not a phone most of us could ever hope to use one-handed.The XA2 Ultra is clearly a product of Sony's outgoing expression of design: thick bezels, sharp corners and absolutely no personality whatsoever. I suppose the device might look imposing in black, but our gold unit gives  the impression of trying too hard to look high-end while simultaneously failing to persuade anyone that it actually is.The materials don't help the cause, either. Sony relied on metal along the perimeter and plastic for the back. It has the appearance of aluminum, which I suppose is better than not, and enough middling budget phones with metal bodies have passed through my hands to the point where the plastic actually doesn't offend me much. It probably keeps the XA2 Ultra from being even more overweight than it already is, so that's good.But aside from the headphone jack, Sony's signature hardware camera button, and the aforementioned fingerprint sensor, there's absolutely nothing noteworthy about the XA2's Ultra design. It isn't even water resistant.The XA2 Ultra's 6-inch 1080p LCD display is as well-rounded as you'll find at this price. Although the resolution is a bit low considering the display's size, the Xperia's panel more than makes up for that shortcoming with excellent outdoor visibility and proper color calibration.The brightness impressed us the most. At a peak of 602 nits, the XA2 Ultra can get roughly 15 percent brighter than the HTC U11 Life and the Moto X4 Android One,  both of which also claim really nice screens. That's even better than the iPhone X, with its 574-nit max.The Xperia's hues are spot-on too, with a Delta-E accuracy rating of 0.36. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) The XA2 reproduced 151.3 percent of the sRGB color spectrum in its Standard display profile. This mode gives saturation a little lift, but doesn't boost it as much as the Super Vivid setting, so I find it to be a nice middle ground.Like so many smartphones today, the XA2 Ultra has dual lenses — though they aren't located where you'd expect them.Above the screen are a pair of 16- and 8-megapixel front cameras. Unlike so many multi-lens setups, they strangely can't be used for portraits with bokeh effects, although they do allow you to switch perspectives on the fly. The main 16-MP sensor features optical image stabilization and employs a narrow perspective, while the secondary shooter has a 120-degree field of view, making it ideal for group shots.Selfies on the XA2 Ultra appeared a fair bit sharper with stronger contrast than those taken on one of our favorite midrange phones for photography, HTC's U11 Life. However, the Xperia's increased saturation gave my face a splotchy skin tone that I could have done without. Although Sony's handset doesn't feature a dedicated portrait mode, the front-facing shooter subtly blurred the tree  in the background. It was a nice stylistic element missing from HTC's rendition.But the XA2 Ultra really demonstrated the worth of its front-facing array in low light, when its flash came into effect. Sony's phone produced a brighter, crisper shot in our dimly lit video studio compared to the U11 Life, which has no flash and had to rely on heavy post-processing and smoothing to achieve a comparable result. Again, though, I must complain about the XA2 Ultra's lighting and color balancing, which painted pink shadows under my eyes, as if I hadn't slept for a week.For one last selfie test, I grabbed my colleague Henry for a quick comparison between the normal and wide-angle lenses on Sony's handset. The perspective on the secondary camera provided a nice change of pace from the selfies you get from most phones, and helps you include more people in the shot when necessary or capture more of the background. Images taken in this mode also automatically employ a wider aspect ratio, so all that extra content in the frame doesn't go to waste.Unfortunately, the XA2 Ultra's 23-MP, f/2.0 rear camera struggled considerably more than its selfie shooters, opting for dim exposures that frequently muddied details in the shadows, even in outdoor light.The U11 Life outperformed Sony's best efforts across the board. In our offices using HDR mode on both devices, the XA2 Ultra delivered oversaturated yet cool colors and a slight haziness that negated its megapixel advantage over HTC's 16-MP phone. This was particularly noticeable in the leaves of the plant, which lacked texture on the Xperia. Even worse, the XA2 Ultra took 2 seconds longer on average to process HDR shots.The situation didn't improve when we ventured into Bryant Park, which was coated in snow after yet another nor'easter. The XA2 Ultra failed to capture the green of the umbrellas and the pastel tones of the chairs, while the plants toward the left edge of the frame were completely underexposed.Mercifully, the Xperia clawed back some credibility in this final shot, thanks in large part to much better lighting. However, zooming in revealed many familiar pitfalls. Everything from the imperfections in the surface of Gertrude Stein's statue, to the sign in front and even the tree trunk was smoothed over. It'd be passable for a budget phone costing half the price, but $449 is simply too much to pay for a camera this poor. These days, it's not uncommon to see $500 handsets powered by flagship chipsets, like the OnePlus 5T and Honor View 10. The XA2 Ultra isn't quite as expensive as those phones, at $449, but it's very close.However, inside you won't find one of Qualcomm's premium Snapdragon 800-series processors, but instead a more modest Snapdragon 630 and 4GB of RAM. The 630 is no slouch, and likely able to satisfy most users' needs with a strong enough performance for everything but the most demanding games. But given what some comparably priced phones are packing, it's not the best value out there.MORE: These Smartphones Can Replace a Compact CameraRegarding benchmarks, the XA2 is right on a par with the Moto X4 Android One and the HTC U11 Life. Sony's phone delivered a multicore Geekbench 4 result of 4,207, compared with 4,122 for the Motorola and 4,136 for HTC's offering. Graphics performance was very close as well. In 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test, the XA2 scored 16,821, placing it narrowly above the U11 Life at 16,641 and the X4 at 16,815.The problem is, those phones cost at least $50 less than Sony is asking for the XA2 Ultra. The U11 Life retails for $349, the same as the smaller XA2. And while Motorola normally charges $399 for the X4 Android One, that model is actually going for $249 right now through Google's Project Fi network, which is a steal.Despite the Xperia XA2 Ultra's large footprint, the phone only features a 3,580 mAh battery. That's decently sized, but considerably smaller than what you find in other big handsets, like Asus' 5,000-mAh ZenFone 4 Max.Thankfully, the XA2 Ultra still delivered lengthy performance on a charge, clocking 12:46 in our battery test, which consists of endlessly streaming websites over T-Mobile's LTE network. It's a strong result, no doubt, and good enough to land the XA2 Ultra in our top 10 longest-lasting phones. However, we wish Sony pulled it off with a battery that was quicker to charge.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeA drained XA2 Ultra reached just 19 percent after 15 minutes of charging using the stock wall adapter. It hit 30 percent after 30 minutes, and 56 percent at the end of a full hour. The fastest-charging devices can almost completely top off their batteries in the same amount of time it takes Sony's to cross the halfway mark, so some form of quick-charging support would have really gone a long way here.The XA2 Ultra comes with Android 8.0 Oreo. And while it's not the newer Android 8.1 featured in Google's Pixel handsets, the Honor View 10 and the Essential Phone, it thankfully isn't Nougat, which can still be found in a glut of lower-end devices on sale these days.However, Sony's approach to Oreo seems a bit stale compared with the competition's. That's mostly because the company has been running the same interface on its Android phones dating back to the Marshmallow days, without any significant visual or functional changes.Granted, the Xperia flavor of Android has always been a relatively light touch on stock Android, and it isn't anywhere near as drastic as Samsung's or Huawei's tweaks. Under the hood, everything you expect in Google's sandwich cookie-inspired OS is still there, like notification dots, picture-in-picture and contextual actions for highlighted text.Indeed, this is Oreo — even if it doesn't look the part. Sony is still committed to its own suite of media apps and branding exercises you'll probably never use, like the Xperia Lounge. There you'll find apps, content and themes curated by the company, many of which are already accessible in the Google Play Store.Aside from a bright screen and the latest major revision of Android, there's very little the Xperia XA2 Ultra does that would compel you to choose it over its competitors.Other devices simply promise more for the money. Take the $199 Honor 7X or the $279 Moto G5S Plus, for example. These are two well-rounded handsets that are just about as powerful as the XA2 Ultra where it counts, except they feature modern designs and feature-packed dual lenses.If you have a little more cash to burn, $349 gets you the HTC U11 Life and its best-in-class camera, not to mention Sony's own smaller XA2 with the same processor as the Ultra, only with 3GB of RAM and just one selfie lens. You could also splurge on the newly released Honor View 10 or the very pretty Essential Phone, all of which guarantee flagship-caliber specs for just $499.Like a troubling number of Sony's handsets lately, the Xperia XA2 Ultra is simply too expensive given how dated it feels. And until the company can figure out a way to turn that around, it's going to be very hard to recommend its smartphones.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
193,HTC Vive Pro,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/htc-vive-pro,review-5300.html","While everyone's looking for the next big thing in augmented reality, HTC is still moving the needle for virtual reality with its Vive Pro headset. Equipped with high resolution AMOLED displays, integrated earphones with a built-in amplifier and spatial 3D audio, the Vive Pro elevates the VR market to a whole new level. But at $799, evolution doesn’t come cheap, and without base stations or controllers, the Vive Pro isn't wholly complete.Thank you HTC. Thank you for taking the road less traveled and giving me tech that isn't white, black or gray. No, the majority of the Vive Pro's frame is a stately royal blue with black accents. It's a welcome and noticeable distinction from the original Vive.Like the Vive, The front of the Pro headset is dotted with the strategically placed photo-sensors surrounded by wells of varying depth so the Lighthouse sensors can track the headset. The lone bottom-mounted camera has been swapped out for a centrally-located pair. On the lower left side of the headset, you'll find the power button and a small black knob to adjust the interpupillary distance, which is the measurement in millimeters between the center of the pupils of your eyes.HTC kept the wide top-mounted head strap, but added a large, adjustable blue sideband that's every bit as functional as it is cosmetic. You'll find a large earphone on either side of the headset, so you don't have to go looking for a pair of headphones to plug in anymore. But the best design improvement is the knob in the back. Taking inspiration from the PlayStation VR, the Pro uses the knob to adjust the fit of the band around your head. Turning the knob yields a nice, smooth motion that gently and comfortably adjusted the band.When I reviewed the original Vive, I thought HTC’s headset was pretty comfortable, and it still is. But it's got nothing on the Vive Pro.That adjustable band paired with the wide head strap work together to really distribute the Pro's weight. However, like most VR headsets, the Vive Pro isn't built for an elaborate updo or really big hair, so be prepared to do a bit of follicle feng shui to get it on.Setting up the Vive Pro is still as labor intensive as the original Vive is, but HTC is has eliminated a few of the hassles. The HTC Link, the small box that connects the headset to your PC has undergone some major streamlining. The box got rid of the USB 3.0, HDMI and power ports required to plug in the Vive in favor of a single proprietary port. However, the part of the box that connects to the PC has ports for a USB 3.0, mini DisplayPort, HDMI and power.MORE: The Best VR Headsets Available NowOnce the Pro is connected to a laptop or desktop, it's time to set up the rest of the Vive Pro's accoutrements. That means the shiny black Lighthouse sensors. Since I still had the original base stations (now dubbed SteamVR Tracking 1.0), I needed a minimum 6 feet x 5 feet by 6 inches of free space to create a viable play area with at least 16 feet of space between the pair of mounted sensors. But if you have the space available, you can invest in the SteamVR 2.0 setup which extends the play space up to 10 x 10 feet. Just make sure you have enough electrical outlets to support everything.The Vive Pro's built-in earphones sound great. I had a blast playing Fallout 4 VR and jamming out to those ‘50s-era tunes while  blasting Raiders and the occasional mole rat. Firing my modified .22 caliber gun had a nice staccato that gave the slight illusion of recoil.Combined with the integrated amplifier, the 360-degree 3D audio significantly upped the immersion factor, especially when I was exploring areas with high-ghoul activities or a Deathclaw or two. If not for having to consciously remind myself that I was tethered to a PC on a rolling cart, I would have taken off running when I heard that telltale feral ghoul growl from behind me. I regained my composure just in time to teleport away, activate the V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System) to slow down time and target a body part.When I wasn't facing down irradiated terrors in Fallout 4's wasteland, I was exploring the ocean floor while dodging sea-faring predators in Operation Apex. I could hear my mechanical fins spinning to get me from Point A to Point B as the water swirled around me. For the most part, the music was tranquil, but when a shark or something else came along to do me bodily harm, there was a huge swell of violins and orchestra drums punctuating my frantic movements to stay alive and in one piece.In short, the Vive earphones are great for just about anything, and terrifying for scary games.The Vive Pro doesn't just have a new look, it has improved specs starting with the screen. The headset has a pair of 3.5-inch AMOLED screens with 1440 x 1600 per eye or 2880 x 1600 combined. The original Vive and Oculus Rift's OLED displays have a resolution of 2160 x 1200 or 1080 x 1200 per eye. That's a 78 percent resolution increase, which definitely makes a difference. Although the resolution is considerably higher, the refresh rate and the field of view remain the same at 90 Hertz and 110 degrees respectively.All those top-shelf specs require a high-end system to support them. HTC has recommends a system with Windows 8.1 or later, with either an Intel Core i5-4590 or AMD FX 8350 CPU or better, with 4GB of RAM and at least a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX480. Port-wise, you'll need a DisplayPort 1.2 along with a USB 3.0 port or newer.The Oculus Rift is a lot more forgiving, needing at least an Intel Core i3-6100 or an AMD FX4350, 8GB of RAM, either an Nvidia GTX 960 or an AMD Radeon RX 470 GPU with HDMI 1.3 and a USB 2.0 ports.While not photo realistic, but the high-resolution displays are game changers. Fallout 4 VR was crystal clear and I could easily read text on the mouldy newspaper in what was once my house. The devastating wasteland was at a scene of ruined beauty. I picked a wild mutfruit to admire its mutated, yet edible form. And unfortunately for me, I could make out every nodule and piece of decaying flesh on the radiated ghouls that were both friend and foe.Switching over to Operation Apex, I marveled at level of detail. I could see the flat, pink surfaces of coral slowly, but surely overtake a nearby crag of rocks. Swimming further, I scanned a trio of sea urchins as their thick black spines undulated with the current.While the Vive Pro has cleaner, sharper images, make no mistake — there's still some screen door effect going on. But with the Pro, I actually have to actively look for those vertical lines whereas with other VR headsets they're right before your eyes. Ultimately, there's room from visual improvement, but HTC is definitely on the right track as this is some of the smoothest VR rendering you're going to get until 4K and 8K displays hit the VR market.When you're ready to interact with your VR content, you can do so in one of two ways: Steam Home Beta or Viveport VR. Steam Home takes the familiar apartment interface that the Rift and Gear VR first introduced and teases out certain features to make its version stand out. For starters, if you don't want that tired apartment look, you can download different backgrounds for you to play around in. I switched mine over to a cabin in the woods with a fireplace and a gentle rain pouring down outside.Content is presented in tile form with three large ones aggregating your Friends, Rooms and Apps. Friends displays which of your Steam friends are online and what they're doing at the moment. Rooms is the VR take on the chat room, allowing you to go an interact with people via their avatars. Apps lets you access all the games and apps you currently have available.Similar to Oculus, you can customize your avatar with all manner of accessories. I decked mine out with a top hat and a rose. However, the Oculus avatars have a decidedly more human appearance; Vive avatars look like the blocks a 4-year-old would play with.You can actually earn more gear to jazz up your avatar and Steam Home interface by going on one of the many quests HTC has introduced. Designed to get you acquainted with the interface, the quests are fairly easy and typically yield an accessory or piece of furniture.As for the Viveport VR interface, it places you in what looks like a future-forward airport utopia. Most of the platforms are ovular and made of a blindingly white material. It's here where you can interact with VR previews of content so you have a better understanding of what a game or title entails before you purchase or download it. In other words, try before you buy, VR style.There are currently more than 3,000 titles available for the Vive Pro according to HTC. And while most Vive users started out getting their games and apps from SteamVR, HTC is pushing VivePort as the destination to get your VR fix.MORE: Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive: The Rift Is Best All AroundTo date, you can access more than 1,000 titles on the Viveport store, with 400 of those titles available via Viveport subscription which allows you to download five games a month. The monthly subscription plan starts at $8.99 for one month and tops out at $79.99 for one year.  Of course, you won't find AAA titles like Skyrim VR or Fallout 4 on the subscription list, but Viveport is still a great way to explore VR titles without breaking the bank.The original Vive featured a single camera that worked in tandem with the Chaperone system to let you look out into the real world when you got to close to walking into a real-world object. And while Chaperone worked for the most part, I noticed that more often times than not, the depth tracking was off, leading to some potential kerfuffles.The Vive Pro is equipped with a pair of camera with one of the lenses dedicated to depth mapping. Both HTC and VR developers are working on tools to take advantage of this new feature, but the company has nothing to announce as of yet.For now, HTC is selling the Vive Pro by its lonesome for $799.99. For consumers that snag their Vive Pro by June 3, you'll get a free six-month trial of Viveport Subscription.There's no word on when the SteamVR Tracking 2.0 equipment will become available, so for now you'll have to deal with the gen-1 base stations and controllers.We're also waiting on availability and pricing for the Vive Wireless Adapter, that will finally let us cut the cord once and for all. As the Pro headset has shown us, it's unlikely that any of this new tech is going to come cheap. But if you really, really want a Vive and don't want to shell out $800, you can get the original Vive kit for $499.HTC really doesn't want you to take the Vive Pro off. That's why the Phone Sync feature from the original Vive remains. Connected via Bluetooth with the free Vive app (Android, iOS), you can now get texts, calls and other notifications while you're plumbing the depths of VR.You can control which notifications get into your VR world in the settings menu. I switched on notifications, so I could send myself an alarm after an hour of play. Otherwise, I might still be in my virtual world, slashing ninjas, playing streetball and dodging hungry sharks.In the battle for virtual reality supremacy, HTC has taken a definitive lead with the Pro. The headset is head and shoulders above anything currently on the market.Let's start with design. Using wider headstraps, an adjustable fit knob and a properly weighted face gasket, the Vive Pro is more comfortable to wear than both its predecessor and the Oculus Rift. HTC also dared to be different with a nice shade of blue. Then there's the high-res displays and audio. If you want crisp, gorgeous graphics and true spatial audio, accept no substitutes.However, it's not all milk and honey in Vive land. To experience this next step in the evolution of VR, you have to shell out $799 and that doesn't include the controllers nor the base stations. Meanwhile, you can get an OG Vive with everything for $499 or the Oculus Rift with most of its accoutrement for $399. There's also the matter of the dual cameras which pregnant with the potential of possibility. But we're at a loss for when all that depth-sensing goodness is going to come about. And we're also waiting on word for SteamVR Tracking 2.0 as well as the Wireless Adapter.For those reasons, until HTC has more information on any of the unknown variables, I'd only recommend the Vive Pro to the most avid of VR aficionados. But those VR early adopters will get an impressive headset if they’re willing to buy now.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
194,Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-j7-prime,review-5202.html","You'd be forgiven for thinking Samsung only releases premium Android flagships with brilliant displays and killer cameras, because that's all we see in TV commercials. But the company also makes budget phones, such as the Galaxy J7 Prime. You won't get the latest and greatest features from a $220 Galaxy model, but if you want the bare-bones Samsung experience, the J7 Prime is just fine.The J7 Prime comes in a few different variants, depending on where you buy it. You can buy the phone unlocked on Amazon with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and a 13-megapixel rear camera for $220. If you order it through T-Mobile or MetroPCS, the version you buy will sport 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage and an 8-MP camera. MetroPCS offers the best deal currently, selling the phone for $119. For this review, I tested the Amazon version.The J7 Prime will not work on CDMA networks, so Verizon and Sprint customers are out of luck. If you buy an unlocked phone from Amazon, double-check that it will work on your carrier's network before you throw out the packaging and return label.The J7 Prime is identical to the Galaxy S6, which debuted in 2015. Some would consider this look dated, but I don't mind the classic Samsung design. The gold aluminum back and white plastic trim aren't cutting-edge compared with Samsung's newer, glass-covered Galaxy devices, but at this price, who cares?Like the S6, the J7 Prime features a fingerprint sensor, an app switcher and a back button on the chin. Again, you're not getting an edge-to-edge display, or even a USB-C port — Samsung stuck with micro USB for this budget model — but I don't mind this look.The J7 Prime runs Android 7.0 Nougat with version 8.1 of Samsung's TouchWiz UI (now known as the ""Samsung Experience"") layered on top. That means you're a generation behind  regarding software — the just-announced Galaxy S9 runs Android Oreo with Samsung Experience 9.0, and the Galaxy S8 is in the process of getting the update, too. As a result, you'll miss out on features such as Bixby should you opt for the J7 Prime, but you'll still have access to Nougat features like Google Assistant, quick app-switching and split-screen Chrome browsing.A handful of comparably priced phones, such as the $250 Moto G5S Plus, offer dual lens cameras, sleeker finishes and the promise of an upgrade to Android Oreo on the horizon. The $200 Honor 7X has a more modern 18:9 aspect ratio in a display that extends practically edge-to-edge. But we're not docking points for Samsung's old-school design, which still has its fans.The J7 Prime's 5.5-inch full-HD display isn't the best in Samsung's Galaxy lineup, but the 1080p LCD panel is pretty standard at this price.Honor is pushing boundaries for budget phones with the 7X's 5.9-inch, 2160 x 1080 LCD screen, so if watching videos on a superwide screen is important to you, then the J7 Prime isn't the best phone.But Samsung's panel on this handset is bright and clear with true-to-life colors, just like the Moto G5S Plus. The J7 Prime notched a 0.30 Delta-E rating, which measures color accuracy. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) In our testing, the J7 Prime's display was comparable to the Galaxy S8, which scored a 0.28.The J7 Prime's screen reproduced 105.4 percent of the sRGB color spectrum, in line with comparably priced phones. The G5S Plus covered 109 percent of the gamut.The J7 Prime falters slightly when it comes to brightness, reaching 410 nits in our light-meter test. The smartphone average is 433 nits, but we don't expect a full-HD LCD panel to compete with ultra-bright (and ultra-expensive) OLED displays. You can find brighter displays at this price, though, including the Honor 7X (510 nits).MORE: Best Unlocked Smartphones 2018Overall, the J7 Prime's display is perfectly acceptable. I was immersed watching Jessica Jones flee explosions in the trailer for season 2 of Netflix's Marvel series.I tested the J7 Prime model with a 13-MP rear camera, which is a bump up from the base model's 8-MP lens.I was able to capture solid shots, like a nighttime scene in Bryant Park, without a ton of noise or color distortion. The details of the image, such as bare trees and a street lamp against the early evening cobalt sky, are clear and actually kind of pretty for a budget camera.The 8-MP selfie camera, however, was a different story. I'm not much for selfies, anyway, but this low-quality lens made me look like an alien. It was even worse when I toggled on the beauty filter, which lets you adjust the shade and smoothness of your skin tone, slim your face and widen your eyes. I turned every setting on as high as it would go and vowed never to take a photo of myself again as long as I live. (Just kidding, but it will be a few days.)Despite its sizable 3,300 mAh battery, the J7 Prime lasted a middling 8 hours and 32 minutes in the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web-surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network).The smartphone average is 9:50, so the J7 Prime isn't terrible. But the G5S Plus will last you 11 hours and 50 minutes, while ZTE's Blade V8 Pro lasts a whopping 12:08. The Honor 7X also offers longer battery life, at 9:21. Opting for a lower-priced phone shouldn't mean compromising on battery life, but in the J7's case, it does.  MORE: 14 Cheap Smartphones (Under $200) Ranked Best to WorstWe wouldn't mind the below-average battery life if the J7 Prime offered a quick-charging option, like the Moto G5S Plus does. But it'll take you an hour to charge up the budget Galaxy to 50 percent, which is just too long. The G5S Plus takes 15 minutes to add an extra 6 hours of battery life. With longevity being one of the key features smartphone buyers look for, the J7 Prime fails to impress.Phones in the $200 to $250 range are upping the ante regarding performance, and the J7 Prime is competitive when it comes to speed and power in a budget phone, thanks to the Samsung-built Exynos 7870 processor inside.Samsung's phone clocked a 3,580 score in the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance, in line with the Moto G5 Plus (3,746) and ZTE'S Blade V8 Pro (3,018). Another $200 phone we recently tested, Nuu Mobile’s X5, turned in a paltry 2,623, so you can definitely get more bang for your buck with the J7 Prime's 1.6 GHz octa-core CPU.However, Samsung's budget device isn't the greatest for gaming. In 3D Mark's Ice Storm Unlimited test of graphics performance, the J7 Prime produced a score of 8,140. Other phones in this price range are far more capable — the G5 Plus scored 13,862, while the Blade V8 Pro clocked in at 11,897. Honor's 7X turned in a decent performance, at 11,586.The J7 Prime certainly isn't sluggish when it comes to lightweight games; I played Super Mario Run with ease. For more demanding, graphics-intensive runners and first-person shooters, you may want to snag a Moto phone such as the $210 G5 Plus.Some people find old-fashioned phones reassuring. You don't have to relearn how to use a new interface, and every button is located right where it always has been. That's the case with Samsung's Galaxy J7 Prime, which offers the classic design of the Galaxy S6 for $220 (or even less if you buy a version with more basic specs from MetroPCS).If you don't expect much from a budget phone, the J7 Prime does a perfectly fine job of surfing the web, taking photos and playing basic games.But you can get more premium features at this price. The Honor 7X offers a nearly bezel-free display and a dual-lens camera with a unique (but polarizing) user-interface experience. The Moto G5 Plus and the G5S Plus bundle better performance and longer battery life in a classic smartphone package. Those phones are also expected to get an upgrade to Android Oreo at some point, which the J7 Prime will not.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
195,Essential Phone (PH-1),Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/essential-phone-ph-1,review-4629.html","It takes a lot of guts to go up against Samsung and Apple these days if you're a smartphone startup. And it takes an equal amount of guts to release a phone with a key feature that is as rough as what you'll find on the new Essential Phone.Essential is no ordinary underdog. Its founder and CEO, Andy Rubin, helped create Android; the company also has several ex-Apple and ex-Google employees among its ranks; and investments already place Essential's value at more than $1 billion. Essential isn't just making a phone, either. It's trying to build an ecosystem that includes a new smart home assistant to go head-to-head against the Amazon Echo and Google Home.But the Essential Phone (which is now available for $499 after a price cut) is where it all starts. Available through Sprint or unlocked, the handset sports a stunning titanium design with an edge-to-edge display, a clever modular system that has the potential to top what's already out there and a generous 128GB of storage. Unfortunately, the Essential Phone's camera performance simply doesn't measure up, and there are performance bugs that need to be addressed.The Essential Phone is simultaneously classic and modern. Its squared-off edges remind us of earlier iPhones, while the edge-to-edge screen looks and feels like the future.This phone is also tough. It has a superdurable titanium frame that the company claims doesn't scratch, dent or bend. The back is made of ceramic, which is scratch-resistant but very prone to fingerprint smudges. It's worth noting, though, that the Essential Phone doesn't offer any water resistance.The back of the device also houses the magnetic connectors for the Essential Phone's modular add-ons (more on that later). The bottom has a USB Type-C port, but you won't find a headphone jack, which is a bummer. Some may lament the lack of a microSD card slot, but it's hard to complain when this phone comes with 128GB of storage built in.The Essential Phone's titanium-and-ceramic design is simultaneously classic and modern.Weighing 6.5 ounces, the Essential Phone is quite heavy, given its 5.7-inch screen. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy S8 weighs only 5.5 ounces, and it has a 5.8-inch display, though the display is narrower than the Essential's panel.We tested the Black Moon color of the Essential Phone, but it's also available in Pure White; Stellar Gray and Ocean Depths are listed as ""available soon.""The 5.71-inch screen on the Essential Phone is simply captivating. This quad-HD (2560 x 1321 pixels) display stretches from the left edge to the right edge of the device, and there's a small bezel or chin beneath the screen. There's no physical home button; instead, you use on-screen buttons along the bottom to navigate, and a fingerprint sensor beneath the camera for unlocking the device.There's only one pockmark on this design, and it's the front camera, which swoops down from the top and interrupts the edge-to-edge flow. It's not much of an eyesore when you're watching content on a darker screen or you're on the home screen, but it is a distraction when you're on a page with a white background, such as the Google Play store or in the Chrome browser.The screen performed well on our benchmark tests, covering an impressive 159 percent of the sRGB color gamut, which is better than the LG G6 but behind the Galaxy S8 and OnePlus 5. I appreciated rich hues as I watched the trailer for Thor: Ragnarok on this screen, including the way Thor's dirty-blonde locks popped against his shiny chrome-and-gray uniform.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe screen delivers fairly accurate colors, too, as it turned in a Delta-E score of 0.28. That's nearly perfect, as 0 is ideal, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Because this is an LCD panel and not OLED, blacks can look gray, and the contrast wasn't as good as it could have been as I watched the final scene from this season's Game of Thrones finale.I know phones can get better over time with firmware and software updates — and Essential has already issued a couple — but this is not a camera Essential should have put in consumers' hands.The camera was very slow to capture and store images; I noticed a spinning circle way too often in the upper right-hand corner after snapping a shot.The dual 13-megapixel cameras on the back feature a f/1.85 lens, with one RGB and one monochrome camera. You don't get an optical zoom from these dual shooters, as you do from the Galaxy Note 8 and iPhone 7 Plus. But Essential claims that this setup can capture up to 200 percent more light than traditional phone cameras; you can also shoot black-and-white images.It's possible that Essential may roll out a portrait-mode-like effect for the dual cameras, according to The Verge, but we'll have to see.In head-to-head tests with the Galaxy S8 indoors, the Essential Phone struggled, especially in low light. Take this shot of a few figurines and marbles: The Essential image is downright dingy and blurry, compared to the S8's shot. It's also hard to make out the grain on the table in the Essential photo.Worse, the Essential Phone's camera was very slow to capture and store images; I noticed a spinning circle way too often in the upper right-hand corner after snapping a shot. Sometimes I had to wait 3 seconds before taking another photo.The Essential Phone camera does fairly well in bright lighting conditions. A photo taken of tomatoes was sharp and colorful on both phones; the S8 has a slight edge in terms of contrast and a bit more vivid reds.A shot of flowers I took exhibited a good amount of detail in the bright-purple petals. However, the S8's image had brighter green leaves and detail in the shadows.Annoyingly, while the Essential Phone's camera has an HDR mode, you need to manually enable it every time you open the camera app; it doesn't remember your settings. We hope that gets fixed, pronto.When cropping into a statue of William H Seward, the S8's camera won out with a more defined face. To be fair, though, both images looked great when zoomed out.Like the Moto Z line, the Essential Phone is designed to support snap-on accessories, but the implementation is better on this upstart phone.For instance, Essential's 360 camera ($199 to add on, $99 as part of a bundle with the phone) is a lot more compact than the full-size sleds Motorola sells, which cover the entire back of its phones. Essential's accessory attaches only to the top part of the back of the phone, taking up about a quarter of the space.This module is smaller partly because the data transfer happens over a form of wireless USB; the connector is really just for delivering power. The Essential camera even has a mini fan for dissipating heat.The problem with Essential's modules is that there are so few of them. It only offers the 360 camera, while Motorola has a couple of dozen Moto Mods to choose from, including power packs, a projector, speakers and more. And Essential will likely need to work with developers to grow the number of options, which could be tough to do for a smaller company.Unlike Motorola's Moto Mods, the compact 360 camera add-on for the Essential Phone takes up about a quarter of the space.So about that camera module... Measuring 2.6 x 1.3 x 0.5 inches, the Essential 360 camera looks like one of those Amazon Dash buttons with two lenses at one end. It’s a lot smaller than the Samsung Gear 360, another $179 camera whose handle alone is larger than the Essential camera.We like that the Essential 360 camera snaps onto the top of the phone. Most other 360 cameras, such as those from Insta360, attach to a phone’s Lightning or USB port, which means you have to hold your phone upside down in order to use it. As noted above, a small fan in the 360 camera itself whirs to life once connected to the Essential phone. It’s not overly loud, but its high-pitched whine is like hearing a mosquito a foot from your ear.MORE: Best 360 CamerasInside the Essential 360 are two 12-MP lenses, each with an f/1.8 aperture. It takes 360-degree photos at a resolution of 6080 x 3040 pixels, and records video at 3840 x 1920 at 30 fps.In an outdoor photo taken by Madison Square Park, the Essential camera didn’t record colors as well as the 360 cam competition. An orange trash can looked more faded than the photos from the Samsung Gear 360 and the Insta360 One. It did a better job at exposing the shadowed face of photographer (who had his back to the sun), but it suffered from much more lens flare, and had much less contrast overall.Indoors, the Essential camera was less effective. Black lettering on a white sign was nearly washed out in the Essential’s photo. The Samsung Gear 360 came in second, but the sign was most legible from the Insta360 One’s camera. However, the Essential’s camera did a better job at eliminating lens flare from an overhead light, and the reds, oranges, and greens in stacks of apples was pleasingly colorful, on a par with the other two cameras. It also did a good job exposing for our photographer’s face, though his skin tone was a bit redder than it should have been.While the Essential 360 camera takes pretty good photos for its size and price, its app needs a lot of work. The camera was slow to launch, sometimes taking as many as 5 seconds. It was occasionally slow to take a photo, too.  Several times, we saw a black screen when we switched back to the camera from the photo gallery, or when going from 4K to 2K resolution. we had to relaunch the app, or reconnect the camera to the phone, in order for it to work again.After taking a picture with the Essential camera, you can share it to your social network of choice, add a filter, or make basic adjustments to lighting, color, and what the app calls “Pop,” which makes things look more vibrant. If you make edits to a photo, though, it saves it as a flat file, so you can’t view and scroll around it as a 360-photo on the phone.There’s little in the way of in-camera adjustments. You can switch between 4K and 2K resolution, but that’s it. There’s no self-timer, no way to adjust white balance, nor HDR mode.In my time with the Essential phone, its Snapdragon 835 processor and 4GB of RAM delivered fairly swift performance. I raced around the track in the Asphalt 8 game, streamed YouTube trailers and then went back to mowing down enemies in Frontline Commando — all without seeing a lag.However, I did notice some buggy behavior at times. For example, the Injustice 2 game temporarily got stuck in portrait mode (it's a landscape-based game), though that could have been the app itself. The worst bug was that the camera app crashed, and I couldn't up up the app until I rebooted the phone.On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the Essential Phone scored 5,960. That's below what the Galaxy S8 turned in (6,295), as well as the OnePlus 5 with 8GB of RAM (6,542). The Moto Z2 Force also notched a higher 6,489 score.On the plus side, the Essential hit a fairly good 40,748 on the Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test, which beats the S8 (35,903) S8+ (39,576) and Z2 Force (39,807).With its 3,040-mAh battery, the Essential Phone didn't last as long as we hoped. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involved web surfing over Sprint's 4G LTE network, the Essential lasted 8 hours and 9 minutes.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThat's well below the category average of 9:40, and also shorter than the Galaxy S8 (10:39) and Moto Z2 Force (10:23). The OnePlus 5 lasted an epic 13:06.The best thing about the Essential Phone's software is what you don't see. With the exception of a single My Sprint app, you won't find any carrier bloatware here. In fact, this is the closest thing to pure Android 7.1 this side of a Google Pixel phone.You won't find many special features here, although I do like that you can quickly launch the camera by double tapping the power button. The camera is custom but very stripped down, and there's an app for sending diagnostic data to Essential.Between its uniquely compelling design, lack of software clutter, beefy storage and smart add-on system, the Essential Phone is a handset with a lot of potential. But potential doesn't justify spending around $500 for a phone. Execution does.And, unfortunately, the Essential Phone falls flat on the most important phone feature, which is the camera. The sluggish speed and weak low-light performance make it difficult to recommend this device over the Samsung Galaxy S8, even if you can now get the Essential Phone for $250 less than Samsung's flagship. The performance bugs don't help either. And while the OnePlus 5's camera isn't stellar, that phone offers a better-looking OLED screen, faster performance and much longer battery life for less than $500.The Essential Phone could indeed get better over time with updates, but limited distribution and a limited selection of add-on modules are working against this startup. Then there's the fact that Google's Pixel 2 is on the way, delivering the new Android Oreo out of the box. Overall, the Essential is gorgeous and innovative, but it's simply not a practical choice — at least not yet.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
196,BlackBerry KeyOne,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blackberry-keyone-specs-price,review-4219.html","Let's be blunt: We will never return to BlackBerry's glory days, when phones stamped with that company's logo ruled the mobile world. But that doesn't mean that BlackBerry has to settle for being a distant also-ran in a world dominated by phones from Apple and Samsung. TCL now makes phones under the BlackBerry banner, using that company's security-focused software and branding on an Android device. And with the $549 BlackBerry KeyOne, TCL has produced a phone that will remind you of BlackBerry's glory days.The KeyOne blends a very powerful physical keyboard with an all-day battery in a phone that a lot of productivity addicts will be happy to use, both around the office and at home. The processor inside the KeyOne feels a little underpowered and that price tag seems steep, but this is a phone that ultimately helps you get the job done.• A new model of the BlackBerry KeyOne, the Black Edition, is now up for sale in the U.S. through Amazon and Best Buy. The KeyOne Black Edition retails for $549 and features 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, compared to the 3GB and 32GB in the standard KeyOne, respectively. The Black Edition was previously sold internationally late last summer, but is only now being offered stateside.TCL has packed a lot of phone around a fairly minimal screen. The KeyOne has a 5.87 x 2.85 x 0.37-inch frame, which is roughly the same height and width as the 5.86 x 2.83 x 0.31-inch LG G6, though the BlackBerry device is a little bit thicker. Even though these two phones are essentially the same size, the G6 hosts an expansive 5.7-inch display; the KeyOne, in contrast, offers a noticeably more compact 4.5-inch screen. The reason, of course, is the physical keyboard on the KeyOne — more on that feature in a moment — which takes up an area on the front of the phone that's normally dedicated to extra screen space.TCL argues that you actually get a lot more usable screen space with its phone than you would with a conventional 5.5-inch screen, since there's no virtual keyboard occupying precious real estate. When you use apps for browsing, chat and surfing the web, that's certainly true, though on other apps that benefit from a larger screen — Netflix or YouTube, for example — you certainly feel the pinch.Another thing you'll feel with the BlackBerry KeyOne is a noticeable heft. The phone tips the scales at 6.3 ounces, which is heavier than the 5.75-ounce G6, as well as the Google Pixel XL (5.9 ounces), and both the Galaxy S8 and S8+ from Samsung (5.5 and 6.1 ounces, respectively). Professionals drawn to the BlackBerry name, though, are unlikely to mind the KeyOne's extra heft; it's the result of a sturdy design featuring an anodized aluminum frame, and a textured back that makes the phone easier to grip.Just below the volume rocker on the KeyOne's right side, you'll find a programmable convenience key, which you can set to perform specific actions. I've got mine set to fire up the phone's camera, though other potential shortcuts include composing a text message or email, adding a calendar event or speed-dialing a specific contact.As you'd expect from a phone carrying the BlackBerry name, the KeyOne sports a physical QWERTY keyboard; the letter keys also host numbers and punctuation, which you access by holding down the ALT key. I've spent the past decade with virtual keyboards, so typing on the KeyOne took a little adjustment, but BlackBerry devotees will likely take to it like ducks to water.The KeyOne would be a pretty dull phone, though, if all its keyboard did was type. TCL has built several helpful capabilities into the keyboard, making it easily the best feature on this phone.Start with the space bar, which doubles as a fingerprint sensor. When I started using the KeyOne, I doubted that a slender little sliver of a key could get an accurate read of my fingerprint, but in practice, the sensor on this BlackBerry phone is about as accurate as the one on my iPhone — most of the time it works, except for when my finger is damp.The keyboard also doubles as a trackpad, which doesn't sound like a big deal until you scroll through an article or a lengthy email without ever moving your finger onto the display. I find it's a great way to keep the KeyOne's screen free of smudges.The keyboard's standout feature, though, is its support for shortcuts. Each letter key can be programmed with two shortcuts — one for a long press and another for a short one, so you've got 52 potential shortcuts at your fingertips. It's a handy way to quickly launch a commonly used app without having to search for it on your home screen or app drawer. TCL preassigned some shortcuts, which I wish it had left up to users. At least it's easy to edit which key launches which app, so that you can program the C key to launch Chrome instead of having to use the B key.MORE: Smartphone Buying Guide: 9 Tips for Finding the Right PhoneAt a time when LG and Samsung are stretching their displays from the top of the phone to the bottom, it feels a little odd to go back to a phone hemmed in by a keyboard, but that's what you get when you sign on with a BlackBerry phone. As TCL says, the 4.5-inch display offers plenty of room for composing emails or reading articles, precisely because there's no on-screen keyboard sucking up space. Things feel a little bit more constrained when you're watching a video, though, particularly when you've flipped the phone horizontally and there's a physical keyboard framing Rey's adventures in the latest Star Wars trailer.The Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer didn't exactly pop off the KeyOne’s modest 1620 x 1080 screen, and viewing angles were pretty minimal. At least colors look good, whether it's the bright orange of Poe Dameron's flight suit or the emerald hue of Gamora in Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2.Thanks to that LCD screen, the KeyOne does a solid though unspectacular job of reproducing 134 percent of the sRGB color gamut. That's good, but no match for an AMOLED panel like the one on the Galaxy S8 or Pixel XL, which clock in at 183 percent and 191 percent, respectively. At least the colors that the KeyOne displays are accurate: The BlackBerry phone recorded a Delta-E score of 0.78. That's almost as good as the S8's 0.28 score and much better than the 5.88 score of the Pixel XL. (Numbers closer to zero are better.)For most would-be KeyOne owners, though, the most important thing about this screen is its brightness, since they'll be using the phone everywhere, from the harsh lighting of a cubicle farm to the bright sunshine of the great outdoors. The KeyOne is up to the task, measuring 574 nits on a light meter. That's ahead of the LG G6, which was no slouch at 557 nits, and miles in front of the Pixel XL and its 396-nit score. I never had any problem seeing details on the KeyOne's display, though there's a modest amount of glare when you use the phone in direct sunlight.The KeyOne has one speaker at the bottom of the phone, but it makes the most of that sound. Audio was crisp and loud, and I never had to crank up the volume to hear the barbed dialogue on an episode of Archer I streamed over Netflix or the strains of that familiar Star Wars score during The Last Jedi trailer.Other than the keyboard, the thing that makes the KeyOne a BlackBerry phone is its included software. The phone ships with Android Nougat, but there are some distinctly BlackBerry touches here that are likely to appeal to longtime fans. (In fact, one could argue that there's probably a little too much software on this phone: I counted 45 apps included on the device.)BlackBerry's focus on security means the KeyOne includes the company's Dtek app. This app monitors the security of your device, giving you an overall rating and walking you through how to ratchet up your phone's security. Dtek also monitors which apps are accessing which permissions, even allowing you to set alerts if an app tries to do something like access your contacts or turn on the phone's microphone.I think BlackBerry Hub may be the most helpful app, though. It combines all your communications — email, texts, social network activity — into one area, making it easy for you to check in on things all at once. I certainly appreciate being able to look at Twitter interactions and Gmail messages without having to jump between apps.MORE: Best Android-Only Apps You Can't Find on iPhoneThe BlackBerry KeyOne is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, a midtier mobile processor. Just to put ""midtier"" in context, that's the same CPU powering the Moto G5 Plus, a budget phone that costs more than $300 less than the KeyOne. TCL reasons that people using the KeyOne are primarily looking for a communications device and not one for mobile gaming or other processor-intensive activities. Still, it's a little surprising to see a $500-plus phone without a more powerful CPU.That said, the KeyOne does well at handling the tasks you're likely to use if for. I never noticed a lag when I opened apps, and I was able to stream videos from Netflix without any performance lag. The KeyOne may not be built with gaming in mind, but I was able to play Modern Combat 5 without any lags or stutters. (Using the on-screen controls to rain death upon my enemy was a bit more challenging, but that's more a reflection of the KeyOne's 4.5-inch screen.)We couldn't run GeekBench 4 on the KeyOne, due to a compatibility issue between the app and the phone. (We'll update this story with our test results once the phone's able to run GeekBench.) On the Jetstream 1.1 Javascript test of web browsing, the KeyOne scored a 28.3, just behind the Moto G5 Plus' 30.3 score. As you'd imagine, phones with more powerful processors like the Snapdragon 821-powered LG G6 (56.2) and the Snapdragon 835-powered Galaxy S8 (70.3) dusted the KeyOne.While TCL doesn't promote the KeyOne as a gaming device, we still ran 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test. The BlackBerry phone tallied a score of 13,750, which was behind the smartphone average of 17,586, but in line with the Moto G5 Plus' 13,862 score.You likely aren't turning to a BlackBerry phone because you prize its camera capabilities above all else, but at least TCL has included a capable shooter on the KeyOne. The phone features a 12-megapixel rear camera with 1.55-micron pixels and an f/2.0 aperture, and I was generally pleased with the shots it captured.A photo of my daughter at a friend's birthday party managed to accurately reflect all the colors of a pretty busy play area, and I liked the sharp focus on my daughter's face. But the KeyOne's camera can be hit or miss — another photo shot at the same party, but in a darker play area, loses some of that sharpness. My daughter's hair doesn't stand out as vividly, and the plastic banana she's waving around is an indistinct blur.To see how the KeyOne's camera compares to other smartphones, I compared shots it took to ones captured by a Galaxy S7. (Yes, that phone came out a year ago, but it's still an outstanding camera phone, and the Galaxy S8 essentially uses the same camera.) A shot of an early evening libation came out a little dark on both cameras, but the S7 captured a little more detail, like the chips in the glass and individual bubbles in the ice cubes floating in my drink.Likewise, the S7 takes a better shot of a rose in my garden. The petals stand out more in its shot, while the focus on the KeyOne isn't as sharp.A photo of the miniature baseball hat collection I've stashed in a dark corner of my office really gives you a sense of how the S7's dual-pixel camera excels in lower light. The outlines of the hats are clear in the S7's shot and less distinct with the KeyOne. That said, the BlackBerry phone did a pretty good job capturing red-colored helmets, despite the challenging light.MORE: Best Smartphone CameraUp front, the KeyOne offers an 8-MP selfie cam, which does a pretty decent job of picking up details on your subject's face. I shot a picture of me and my daughter in an unlit room at dusk, and despite some issues with shadows, you can spot bits of stubble on my face, while my daughter's skin looks nice and smooth.The greens on the poster behind us also stand out, even if my green T-shirt gets lost a little bit in the shadows.If the processor and camera on the KeyOne don't exactly seem like what you should expect from a $549 phone, the battery in this BlackBerry more than picks up the slack. The KeyOne lasted 12 hours, 47 minutes on the Tom's Guide battery test, which involves continuous surfing over T-Mobile's LTE network.That's more than 3 hours longer than the average smartphone, and an hour-and-a-half better than both the Galaxy S8+ (11:04) and Pixel XL (11:11). In fact, the BlackBerry KeyOne is the third longest-lasting smartphone we've tested in the last two years, bested only by the Moto Z Play and LG X Power.MORE: Longest-Lasting SmartphonesWhen the battery does run down, you can also expect to recharge fairly quickly, as the KeyOne supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 feature. TCL promises a 50 percent charge in roughly 30 minutes, and my testing seemed to bear that out. I plugged in the phone when its battery indicator was at 17 percent. After a little less than an hour of charging, that number climbed to 79 percent.The KeyOne also offers a Boost mode for those times when you don't have an hour to charge up your phone. Plug in the phone, select the Boost option and TCL says you'll get more efficient charging, which can add a little extra juice to your phone.The BlackBerry KeyOne comes in both GSM and CDMA versions, meaning you'll be able to use it with almost any carrier in the U.S. (You will need to make sure you buy the right version depending on which carrier you use — GSM for AT&T and T-Mobile, for example, or CDMA for Sprint or Verizon.)You can buy the phone unlocked from either Amazon or Best Buy. TCL says additional carrier availability will start in the summer.If you yearn for a phone with a physical keyboard, you're going to be drawn to the KeyOne, regardless of any other features.It's fortunate, then, that TCL has done such a good job building extra functionality into the keyboard and throwing in a long-lasting battery that won't force you to look for an electrical outlet just when you need the phone the most. A $549 price tag will be hard to swallow, especially when lower-cost, unlocked Android phones can match the KeyOne's performance. But the combination of BlackBerry software and hardware that makes you more productive can't be overlooked."
197,Samsung Galaxy On5,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-on5,review-5163.html","Every budget phone involves some form of compromise. And regarding the $129 Galaxy On5 (which you can get unlocked, or for as low as $29 at MetroPCS), there are just too many trade-offs to justify spending even this small amount on a handset running Android 6.0 Marshmallow.The 5-inch display is serviceable, but the On5 comes with a pitiful amount of storage, and the sluggish performance and short battery life don't help, either. I'd almost rather give someone a flip phone than hand them this.Editors' Note: The On5 was released in November 2015, but it's still among the top sellers on Amazon and is still available for sale on MetroPCS' website. If you're looking for a low-cost device, we suggest buying one of our recommended best cheap phones instead.The Galaxy On5 looks and feels like a throwback phone, complete with a physical Home button beneath the display, a plastic back and a microUSB port for charging.There are also pretty thick bezels around the screen, though that's to be expected in this price range.It is good to see a phone that still features a user-replaceable battery in 2018. You just slip your fingertip under the cutout on the back left side, and pop off the cover.From there you can swap out the battery, as well as access the SIM Card slot and microSD card slot, both of which sit above the battery compartment.Another plus: the On5's back has a slightly gritty texture that prevents the handset from slipping out of your hands. The bottom edge of the phone houses a headphone jack next to the microUSB.I hit a brick wall with the Galaxy On5 almost as soon as I started using it. After downloading a few benchmark apps to test the device, the On5 couldn't download Rules of Survival, one of the top games on the Google Play store. Only after I deleted the benchmarks could I get the game on this device, and even then it couldn't completely download all the latest updates so I could start playing.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesThe reason? The On5 has only 8GB of storage, 4.1GB of which is already taken up for system before you take the phone out of the box. I scaled back my ambitions and downloaded the small and more casual Sausage Run instead (155 MB).The good news is that the On5 supports microSD cards up to 128GB, and you can pick one up for $41. Or you could snag a 64GB card for $19.99. However, spending just a bit more up front can get you a better all-around phone, like the Moto G5 Plus ($184 for Prime members), which comes with 64GB of storage built in, or the Honor 7X ($199 for 32GB).The 5-inch display on the On5 has a low resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels, whereas spending just a bit more will get you a full-HD screen on other handsets. When watching the trailer for Black Panther, Angela Bassett's white dress with yellow accents looked dingy on this screen, and it was very hard to make out Chadwick Boseman's outfit, which got totally lost in the shadows.At least the panel is fairly colorful, registering 106.9 percent of the color gamut. It's not very bright, though, at 357 nits. The ZTE Blade Z Max, which costs $119 through MetroPCS, offers a much brighter screen at 510 nits and 1920 x 1080 resolution.The No. 1 reason not to get the Samsung On5, other than the measly storage, is the sluggish performance.After rebooting the phone I tried launching the camera, and it took 6 seconds for the app to fully load. Incredulous, I closed the app and started it again. This time it took 2.5 seconds, which is better but still terrible.There are instances of lag all over the place with the On5. I noticed a significant delay when launching the keyboard just to type a URL, and when closing apps.The On5 packs a 1.3-GHz Exynos 3475 processor and just 1.5GB of RAM, and it showed on the Geekbench 4 benchmark, which measures overall performance. This Samsung turned in a score of 1,237, which is less than half the score from the ZTE Blade Z Max and its Snapdragon 435 processor and 2GB of RAM.With a 5-megapixel shooter in back with LED flash and a 2-MP camera up front, you should expect very little from On5 when it comes to imaging prowess. A photo taken of my golden retriever exhibited a decent amount of detail, but it came out quite dark.Another shot I took of a decorative shelf with flowers and other knickknacks looked very grainy, even without zooming in much.A selfie I took in my office looked brighter, thanks to the powerful overhead lights, and my blue-and-white checkered shirt had accurate color.The Galaxy On5 doesn't offer very good endurance. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which involves continuous web surfing over LTE, the phone lasted just 7 hours and 51 minutes. That's nearly 2 hours less than the smartphone average, and way behind the ZTE Blade Z Max (11:23) and the Moto G5 Plus (11:43). Neither of those phones break the bank, so it's not as if battery life is an area where budget shoppers need to compromise.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeDon't be tempted by the Galaxy On5's low sticker price. MetroPCS sells much better budget phones, such as the ZTE Blade Z Max, which offers a sharper and bigger display, a better metal design, stronger performance and much longer battery life. Plus, it runs the newer Android 7.1, compared with the older Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow on the On5, and comes with 32GB of storage.If you're going the unlocked route, take a good look at the Moto G5 Plus, which offers many of the same benefits as the Blade Z Max and works on all major carriers. It may seem unfair to compare the much older Galaxy On5 to these newer phones, but Samsung is still selling it. And it should probably stop now.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
198,Blu R2 Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blu-r2-plus,review-5161.html","Last year, we came away mostly impressed by the Blu R1 Plus, a $159 5.5-inch phone with excellent battery life and a clean Android experience that was let down only by underwhelming performance.Blu is back with a successor, the appropriately named the R2 Plus, which sports a new processor, improved cameras, a fingerprint sensor and a slightly refreshed design. It's even a bit cheaper, going for just $129 this time around. However, Blu made some sacrifices to hit that more attractive price, which leaves the R2 Plus feeling like a step backward.At $129 unlocked on Amazon, the Blu R2 Plus is one of the least expensive Android phones out there. It supports GSM networks including AT&T, T-Mobile, MetroPCS and Cricket, meaning you can easily take it to one of those carriers, pop in the appropriate SIM card, and enjoy service immediately.However, because the R2 Plus doesn't boast CDMA compatibility, Verizon and Sprint subscribers won't be able to use it on those networks.You wouldn't call the exterior of the R2 Plus beautiful, though it is quirky. The front of the device is mostly featureless, save for a centrally mounted front-facing camera with a vertically oriented earpiece flanking it to the right. Both the shape and positioning of this earpiece is strange, though fortunately it doesn't pose any impact to usability — so calls were still crystal clear.The other odd design choice pertains to the handset's Micro USB port. Not only is it off to one side, but it's placed at the top of the phone opposite the headphone jack. This leaves the bottom edge of the R2 Plus completely bare, a striking contrast from just about every other phone on the market today.Neither of these characteristics are necessarily bad, but they stand out like a sore thumb on a device that is otherwise as bland as any budget smartphone in recent memory. To Blu's credit, the removable aluminum rear cover, which conceals the micro-SD slot and dual SIM trays, does make the R2 Plus feel slightly more expensive than its price would suggest. But that’s about the best praise you can give the design.I was pleased with the responsiveness of the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, which was quite a surprise to find on the back of the R2 Plus given how inexpensive the phone is. However, those with small hands will probably wish Blu placed the sensor a hair lower, as it's a bit too high up for my index finger to reach when I balanced the device in one hand.MORE: Best Unlocked Smartphones 2018Conventional LCD screens in smartphones have gotten so good and so cheap to produce, you really have to go out of your way to find a bad one. The R2 Plus' vibrant and accurate 5.5-inch 1080p panel is further proof of that.The display in Blu's big budget offering notched a peak full-screen brightness of 481 nits, represented 119.2 percent of the sRGB color space, and delivered a Delta-E color accuracy score of 0.38 when we put it through our round of tests. (For Delta-E, numbers closer to 0 are better.) Those are among the best numbers in the budget class, and even more impressive considering how little the R2 Plus costs. The Moto E4 Plus, which costs a little more than Blu's device at $159, compares with an equally broad spectrum of color, slightly dimmer peak brightness at 433 nits, and a Delta-E result that was imperceptibly better, at 0.27.Cameras in budget phones can occasionally produce solid results in ideal settings, though they tend to falter in low light. That’s the case here, as the R2 Plus' 13-megapixel f/2.0 rear lens performed admirably in well-lit scenarios, but was tripped up by the twilight shot below.The R2 Plus' dim rendition of this evening scene in Bryant Park muddies too many details and ultimately ended up a blurry yet grainy mess. For comparison's sake, I snapped the same photo with a Moto G5 Plus, and found its 12-MP f/1.7 lens captured more light, thanks to its wider aperture and dual-pixel sensor. Moto's phone was quicker to focus, too.However, the R2 Plus turned the tables on Motorola's popular flagship contender in this face-off of indoor shots. Notice the detail in the grain of the wood table, the specular highlights falling on the surface and the sharpness of the leaves on the potted plant. The G5 Plus misses all of these aspects, and produced a worse photo because of it.Finally, I snagged a pair of selfies in our office, and the R2 Plus repeated its strong showing in the previous comparison with its 13-MP front-facing camera. Again, it's much sharper than Motorola's attempt, a fact you can tell from the design of my shirt as well as my hair. I wish both phones exhibited better contrast, as the right side of both frames is quite dark. But this is common for devices in this price range.MORE: 11 Cheap Smartphones (Under $200) Ranked From Best to WorstThe R2 Plus' predecessor, the R1 Plus, stumbled when we tested it last year — the consequence of an outdated processor. Although the R2 Plus improves with a newer MediaTek system-on-chip, it's still behind the curve. The R2 Plus' MT6753 processor was introduced in the beginning of 2015, which may as well make it a fossil in this rapidly innovating industry.That chip is paired to 3GB of RAM, which is not an insignificant amount for a $129 handset. However, the Blu R2 Plus still doesn't feel snappy, and its modest hardware demonstrated as much in testing.Putting the R2 Plus through the gantlet of Geekbench 4, the device delivered a mediocre score of 2,319. That's definitely an improvement over the R1 Plus' 1,583, but it's far  from the $229 Moto G5 Plus at 3,746, and the $139 ZTE Blade V8 Pro at 3,018.Graphics performance was also middling, with the R2 Plus notching a result of 5,724 in 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test. The Honor 7X, a device that costs $70 more than Blu's latest, scored twice as high, and the G5 Plus reached 13,862.During my time with the R2 Plus, it was common to wait about 2 seconds upon opening any app — be it something as simple as the dialer, or as resource-heavy as the Google Play Store. Scrolling around in Google Maps felt a little laggy, as did switching apps. Meanwhile, superhero fighter Injustice 2 slowed the R2 Plus down to an unplayably slow frame rate.These days, you can get some pretty remarkable battery life from cheap phones. For example, the Moto E4 Plus and the Asus ZenFone 4 Max, which normally cost $179 and $199, respectively, both delivered about 15 hours on a single charge in our testing.So you don't have to spend a whole lot for great battery life. In the case of the Blu R2 Plus, though, you do have to spend more than $129. Our R2 Plus called it quits after 7 hours and 56 minutes of streaming web pages on T-Mobile LTE. That's nearly 2 hours less than the average smartphone.That's not only underwhelming, but surprising, as I wouldn't classify the R2 Plus' 3,000 mAh battery as small by any means. It certainly didn't feel small when it came time to charge it back up, as the phone reached just 10 percent in 30 minutes connected to the stock wall adapter, and 31 percent in an  hour.MORE: The Best Android Phones You Can Buy Right NowBudget smartphones tend to miss out on the latest versions of Android, and you can add the R2 Plus to that list. Blu's budget offering comes equipped with Android Nougat, and it's version 7.0 — not even the 7.1 revision that has been floating around since late 2016. It's a mostly stock experience, aside from a few odd tweaks to the text scaling around the UI.The R2 Plus' is completely devoid of bells and whistles regarding exclusive software features, though it does come with a fair bit of bloatware, including Amazon, Opera browser, Yahoo Mail and Finance, and a news app called TopBuzz. In a move that will surely annoy users, TopBuzz automatically places itself on your home screen the first time you open it. At least it can be uninstalled.They say you get what you pay for, and in the case of the Blu R2 Plus, you're not getting a whole lot. Bargain hunters may flock to the phone's low price tag, but even at $129, it's simply not worth it, given the below-average battery life and pokey performance.The R2 Plus becomes even harder to justify in light of slightly costlier but much more well-rounded options. Spend $50 more and you can snag a Moto E4 Plus, which feels a little snappier despite its similar specs and could easily last you upward of two days on a charge. Drop $70 to $100 more, and a few really enticing alternatives become available, like the Honor 7X with its 18:9 display, the dual camera-toting ZTE Blade V8 Pro, or the smartly designed and newly Oreo-enabled Moto G5 Plus.If you're searching for a cheap unlocked phone, invest a little more if possible — there are far too many strong options on the market to settle for the R2 Plus.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
199,Nuu Mobile X5,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/nuu-mobile-x5,review-5146.html","In 2016, Nuu Mobile's X5 would've been a competitive Android smartphone. It's an unlocked, solidly built device running a version of Android that's pretty close to stock. And at $200, it's an affordable package.But times have changed. Premium features are winding their way to budget devices more quickly, and $200 phones now include dual-lens cameras, giant batteries and edge-to-edge displays. Some are expected to get Android Oreo sooner rather than later.That means the X5 feels a little … behind. And now that Nuu Mobile has announced the $200 G3 — an all-glass phone with an edge-to-edge display and a dual-lens camera — purchasing the X5 now is like buying a new iPhone in August when September's iPhones will be better and cost the same as the generation they're replacing.That's not to say the X5 is a bad phone. But you can get more for your $200 than this device offers.You can order the X5 directly from Nuu Mobile's online store for $199.99. The phone is also available on Amazon. The X5 comes in silver or black, but it's available only with 32GB of storage.The X5 is unlocked, but it works only with GSM networks, so that limits you to AT&T, T-Mobile and other carriers that use AT&T and T-Mobile's networks. The X5 does not work on Sprint or Verizon.Nuu Mobile's X5 is a solidly built 6-inch smartphone with an all-metal body and curved 2.5D glass. The full-HD display takes up just 5.5 inches, which means it has thick bezels on the top and bottom that feel outdated now that even affordable phones are embracing edge-to-edge displays. I'm not a fan of this look, especially when the X5's chin is used for back, home and app-switching buttons that could have been built into the display itself.The X5 sports a fingerprint scanner, which is on the back of the device. Unlike on Samsung's Galaxy S8, the Nuu Mobile X5's sensor is far enough away from the camera to make it easier to unlock your phone without smudging the lens. The sensor also acts as a shutter when you take a selfie.New budget phones are moving away from plastic and embracing metal, but I found myself wishing that the X5 were a little slimmer, with a more seamless transition from the glass screen to the metal case. Instead, there's an obvious ridge where the two meet. The Honor 7X, which is a similar size and price, feels far more premium than the X5, with its matte aluminum body and curved glass.MORE: Best Unlocked Smartphones 2018The X5 sports a 5.5-inch full-HD (1920 x 1080) LCD panel, which is perfectly serviceable for browsing the web or watching YouTube videos.The display covers 113.6 percent of the sRGB color spectrum, which is right in line with other budget phones. But the X5 falls short when it comes to color accuracy and brightness. The device scored a Delta-E rating of 1.04 (zero is perfect), lagging behind both the Honor 7X and the slightly more expensive Moto G5 Plus.In my experience watching trailers for Solo: A Star Wars Story and Deadpool 2, the colors were muddier than they were on other budget phones.At 411 nits, the X5's peak brightness falls short of the smartphone average (433 nits). Budget rivals such as the Honor 7X (510 nits) and the Moto G5 Plus (591 nits) have displays that easily top the X5's.The X5's 13-megapixel rear camera and 5-MP selfie lens are comparable to other budget devices' cameras, which lack the back-end processing prowess that can make a decent photo great.Like the Moto E4 Plus, the X5 has a serviceable main shooter that can handle indoor and outdoor scenes. Tapping on the Settings gear in the Camera preview mode lets you control exposure, adjust white balance and pick a scene that will automatically adjust the settings to what you're shooting (portrait, landscape, night shots, etc.).Shooting in direct sunlight gets a little dicier — the X5 tends to blow out the sky. That can create some artistic shots, like a Manhattan street scene I captured that looks straight out of a J.J. Abrams movie. (Yes, that was a lens flare joke.)The 5-MP front-facing lens is just OK. A built-in beauty mode is tempting, but the adjustable filters to remove wrinkles and whiten (yes, whiten — this is a problem) your entire face are extremely aggressive. Even at the lowest settings, you look like a version of you that's made entirely of plastic.MORE: 11 Cheap Smartphones (Under $200) Ranked From Best to WorstWhere the X5 drags is battery life, which is seriously underwhelming. The smartphone average is 9 hours and 40 minutes, which we test by continuously surfing the web over 4G LTE. The X5's 2,950-mAh battery clocks in at a paltry 7 hours and 3 minutes, which is far behind the Honor 7X (9:21) and Moto E4 Plus (14:48). Both of those phones have much bigger batteries for the same price as the X5.The X5 does support fast charging, but we tested the phone both with the micro-USB charger that ships in the box and a higher-voltage charger, and neither provided extra juice to the X5. The device charged to 30 percent in 30 minutes and to 60 percent in an hour.The X5's display doesn't exactly bring games to life; the color accuracy, average brightness and lack of richness make you feel like you're watching a low-res TV. But even with 3GB of RAM and a 1.5-GHz octa-core MediaTek chip, the device struggles to achieve seamless gameplay.As I swung Thor's hammer at piles of enemies rushing at me in Marvel: Future Fight, the game kept pausing at pivotal moments. Just a fraction of a second was enough to sustain major blows, which is the exact opposite of what you want when fighting for your (or Thor's) life.We had issues getting 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test to run on our review unit, but the X5's CPU scored a 2,623 on Geekbench 4's test of overall system performance. That's slightly faster than the comparably priced Moto E4 Plus (1,891) but nowhere near as powerful as the Moto G5 Plus (3,746) or the ZTE Blade V8 Pro (3,018). The smartphone average is 3,299.Lightweight web surfing was easy enough, though Chrome tabs didn't load instantly when we toggled between them.MORE: The Best Android Phones You Can Buy Right NowIf you're in the market for a $200 phone, there are better options with more features and better battery life for your hard-earned money. Honor's 7X looks like a premium flagship with an edge-to-edge display and dual-lens camera. The Moto E4 Plus has incredible battery life and a decent camera. For an extra $30, you can snag a Moto G5 Plus, a powerful phone that is scheduled to get upgraded to Android Oreo this year. Nuu Mobile's X5 isn't a terrible smartphone, but the competition is steep.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
200,BlackBerry Motion,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/blackberry-motion,review-5102.html","There's a recurring theme with BlackBerry's smartphones in recent years, one that the brand hasn't been able to shake since it transitioned to Android.BlackBerry's latest devices, built under license by TCL, have been secure and sturdy, with exclusive software features designed to help you get things done faster. Some, like the BlackBerry KeyOne, have even improved on the physical keyboard with gesture support and a space bar that doubles as a fingerprint sensor. But recent BlackBerry phones have also been on the expensive side, despite middle-of-the-road specs.TCL is following the KeyOne with another secure, sturdy smartphone, this time for those of us who don't demand physical keyboards. And once again, it isn't cheap: the BlackBerry Motion starts at $449, putting it in the same price range as the OnePlus 5T, the Essential Phone and the Moto X4. After years of lagging behind the pack, will this be the BlackBerry that finally rises to the occasion?The BlackBerry Motion comes in a single $449 configuration. For that money, you get 32GB of internal storage and an unlocked device that is  compatible only with GSM networks, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket and MetroPCS. If you need more space, there is a microSD slot that can carry up to an additional 2TB.MORE: BlackBerry Motion Debuts, But More Keyboard Phones ComingWhen critics call most smartphones nondescript black slabs, they're talking about devices like the BlackBerry Motion. True, there are little touches all around the handset -- like the soft-touch carbon fiber-effect back panel and chamfered gunmetal frame -- that remind you you're using a serious, business-focused machine for serious, business-focused people. But the phone's not elegant, and compared to many of the devices that passed through our hands last year, it certainly isn't where the industry is headed.The Motion incorporates a 5.5-inch, full-HD panel and an asymmetrical design. At the top, a strip of plastic loops around the phone in a continuous curve, joining the bezel that contains the earpiece and front-facing camera with the portion on the back that houses the rear camera and flash. The bottom of the frame is not curved, so it's there that you'll find the USB-C port, headphone jack and speaker grille. It's a different look, though I wouldn't call it stylish.All of the device's keys are stashed on the Motion's right edge, which will inevitably lead to confusion the first time you pick it up. The power button sits very close to the volume rocker, while the slightly larger and textured Convenience Key used for shortcuts stands on its own farther down the side.The Convenience Key's more prominent placement and design really make it feel like it should be the power button; if you're anything like me, you'll repeatedly mash that key expecting to wake the phone.Those are relatively minor complaints, though, compared to the Motion's eyesore of a bottom bezel. At a time when extraneous surface area is being cropped away wherever possible, this massive chin is comically large. It would have been dated three years ago. I'm not asking for a OnePlus 5T or iPhone X edge-to-edge-style treatment here, but a little trimming would have gone a long way toward making the Motion both easier to hold in one hand and much more attractive compared with its peers.Fortunately, at least the BlackBerry Motion is well-built and water resistant, a first for one of the company's smartphones. The back doesn't feel as premium as the Pixel 2's powder-coated aluminum or the Essential Phone's ceramic, but it is pleasing to the touch. And while the front-mounted fingerprint sensor is a smidge too small, I appreciate that it's a real, physical button. Just make sure you record your prints at the angle you place your thumb when using the phone normally, or else you'll have little success unlocking the phone.A 5.5-inch, full-HD LCD display is about what you'd expect in a midrange phone, and sure enough, that's what you get from the Motion. Those details alone don't tell the whole story, however, because the latest BlackBerry's screen also happens to be one of the best you'll find in its class.It's also one of the brightest. At a peak full-screen brightness of 520 nits, it's right on par with the 515 nits you get from the excellent 5.2-inch panel in the HTC U11 Life. I really like the way BlackBerry has calibrated the colors, too. Although the Motion's screen isn't the most accurate, with a Delta-E rating of 0.73 (numbers closer to 0 are better), it exhibits a deep range of hues, covering 170.7 percent of the sRGB color space.The display isn't garishly oversaturated, nor does it come across as dull or washed out. Much like HTC and Motorola's LCD screens, the BlackBerry Motion's strikes the right balance. And that's very fortunate, because the Motion does not offer any alternate-display modes.The Motion may be running an outdated form of Android — version 7.1.2 Nougat, to be specific — though you can't fault BlackBerry for not leaving its mark on the software. The phone benefits from BlackBerry's suite of workflow apps, which actually present sophisticated solutions to common problems in a few cases.BlackBerry's Android devices typically feature an additional UI layer known as the Productivity Tab, which has returned here. It lives on either the right or left side of the display, similar to the Edge Panel on Samsung's handsets, and functions almost like a widget that aggregates all your emails, messages and social media notifications, while offering shortcuts to your tasks and calendar as well.If that sounds overwhelming, it can be; the Productivity Tab won't be for everyone. But if you're managing a corporate Twitter while pinging co-workers in Slack and fielding emails, it can prove its worth. I will readily admit I don't keep as close an eye on my emails as I probably should, but I appreciate that the Productivity Tab ensures all of my recent conversations are never more than a swipe away.There's also the Motion's innovative digital keyboard, which delivers predictive text in an unusual but effective way. As you type, auto-complete words will appear above letters. To use one of the suggestions, simply swipe up on the associated key. It can be quite overwhelming to see so much noise on the typing surface, but it also opens you up to more than three suggestions at a time, and puts them in your line of sight, which likely means you're more likely to use them.Although you won't find a physical keyboard on the Motion, BlackBerry has preserved one critical button from the KeyOne: the Convenience Key. Press it, and you're presented with shortcuts to various apps and tasks. You can even program the key to display different shortcuts depending on context — whether you're in the car, connected to a specific Wi-Fi network, or in the middle of a meeting you've recorded on your calendar.MORE: The Best Android Phones You Can Buy Right NowLike Alcatel's Boom Key or LG's Quick Button on its X Venture, the Convenience Key is, well, convenient. However, BlackBerry missed an obvious opportunity to let users hold or double-tap the button for secondary commands. Instead, the Convenience Key only responds to single presses, and forces you to make another tap on screen after that to select the shortcut out of a list of three. It's an unnecessary step that almost negates the purpose, and very odd, considering the KeyOne recognizes long and short presses on its keyboard shortcuts — so it's not like this isn't something BlackBerry hasn't made available elsewhere.Regarding security, many of the Motion's unique features are housed inside the DTEK app. BlackBerry is very diligent about making sure its devices are always running Google's latest security patch, but DTEK is as much about educating users to make informed decisions as it is about preventing discreet attacks.One of the DTEK's useful considerations for security-minded owners is the way it monitors apps for abusing permissions. For example, tap on Chrome in the DTEK app, and it will show you all the times Google's browser pinged your location, called up your camera, or started recording from your microphone. It'll break down each location event, and drop a pin on a map precisely where it took place.It's fascinating to see all this information provided so transparently, but ultimately, if you determine a rogue app needs to be curtailed, you'll be whisked back to the stock Android settings menu to turn off those pesky permissions. In those situations, DTEK can feel like little more than window dressing. But BlackBerry's approach to security actually goes much deeper than that, starting at the manufacturing level.Like the KeyOne, and the Priv before it, DTEK is series of phones,  with the processor inside the Motion bolstered by cryptographic keys that are checked against the firmware upon startup along with BlackBerry's servers, ensuring authenticity. A stronger and continuously updated Linux kernel as well as a bespoke bootloader have made BlackBerry's phones notoriously difficult to root — something that can't be said for the majority of Android phones.The Motion comes equipped with the largest battery ever  in a BlackBerry device, at 4,000 mAh. The last of the company's handsets we tested, the KeyOne, managed to last nearly 13 hours in our testing on a smaller 3,505-mAh pack — so if anything we expected to see better longevity here.Surprisingly, the Motion lasted for 11 hours and 44 minutes when we ran it through our battery test, which consist of continuous web surfing on T-Mobile LTE. A result in the neighborhood of 12 hours is still very strong, though a little surprising given the size of the Motion's battery.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeFor example, the Pixel 2 XL, with its remarkably sharp OLED display and processor tuned for performance rather than efficiency, bested the Motion at 12 hours and 9 minutes despite having a battery about the same size as the KeyOne's. And the $199 Asus ZenFone 4 Max, featuring one of the largest batteries we've tested at 5,000 mAh, delivered nearly 15.5 hours.Powered by Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 system, the phone reached 30 percent in the first 30 minutes connected to the stock wall adapter. That'sat the bottom of the fastest-charging phones we tested, but it soon picked up the pace; in an hour it hit 74 percent, which is about even with the Pixel 2 XL and the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Not shabby at all for such a large battery.One of our primary sticking points with the BlackBerry KeyOne was its relatively underwhelming specs compared to the midrange competition. Like the Motion, that phone featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 system-on-chip. And also like the Motion, it cost a pretty penny, retailing for $549 when it released last spring.To be fair, the Motion does have a little more grunt under the hood, thanks to 4GB of RAM, compared with the KeyOne's 3GB. But that's still awfully disappointing when we've seen phones like the Moto G5 Plus offer the same processor for more than $200 less. Similarly priced phones,  like the OnePlus 5T and the Essential Phone, run flagship-caliber Snapdragon 835 silicon for just $50 more than the Motion. BlackBerry's latest is once again neither here-nor-there, which makes it a tough sell in a very competitive market.  MORE: Best Phones 2018Still, the Motion proved itself powerful enough to tackle most tasks, so long as they didn't push the phone's graphical capabilities to the limit. In Geekbench 4, a benchmarking app that measures overall system performance, the device delivered a score of 2,640. That's a ways off from the aforementioned G5 Plus and its  3,746, but the Motion did not feel noticeably slower when juggling Chrome tabs, navigating in Google Maps, or streaming YouTube videos.Graphics performance was similarly average. In 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test, the Motion managed 12,779. That's good enough to outperform the $199 Honor 7X at 11,586, but well short of the $349 HTC U11 Life and its impressive 16,641 score.Camera quality is one of the major differentiators in choosing a smartphone today, and while the Motion won't put BlackBerry's imaging capabilities on the map, it performs a little better than you might expect.The Motion is equipped with a 12-megapixel, f/2.0 aperture lens on the back and an 8-MP, f/2.2 lens on the front. There's no fancy dual-camera trickery here — the Motion can't manage shallow depth-of-field portraits or optical zoom with its single lens. But this isn't a significant loss, as most dual-camera systems in budget and midrange phones aren't nearly as useful as their higher-priced counterparts.Head-to-head with the $349 HTC U11 Life and its 16-megapixel f/2.0 lens, the Motion's shots were a touch fuzzier on every occasion. Those missing megapixels make a difference when it comes to capturing those finer details, evident in these two portraits of my colleague Shaun.If you zoom into the U11 Life's rendition, you can actually see the texture of his jacket and shirt. There's more gradation in his skin tone, and the background is blurred a bit more strongly, adding a little drama to the scene. The Motion's portrait isn't poor by any means, but it's also not outstanding given the price of the phone.These late-afternoon shots taken inside an arched entryway outside our office in New York demonstrate the Motion's penchant for more saturated color and contrast in low light. However, boosting these qualities doesn't necessarily guarantee a better photo, as we can see that the light passing through from the opposite side of the foyer absolutely scorches the ground and blows out the middle of the frame. The HTC doesn't struggle with these highlights to the same degree, though that comes at the expense of a noticeably darker exposure overall.On a dreary morning in Bryant Park, the Motion held its own against the U11 Life, but the BlackBerry's unnaturally warmer tint produced hues in the chairs and umbrellas that were louder than they should have been. A comparison between the front-facing cameras in both phones produced similar results.Finally, users may appreciate the Motion's secret party piece: Locker Mode. Locker Mode allows you to use the phone's fingerprint sensor as a shutter button, which also encrypts the image. To view it later, you'll have to scan your fingerprint again. Whether you're entrusted with classified documents on a regular basis or lead a salacious private life, the feature should come in handy.Despite its uninspired looks, there's actually a lot under the surface that differentiates BlackBerry's latest smartphone from the horde of budget options available to Android users. But is the premium worth it?The Motion has a great display, a solid camera and a decent processor — but  so do many other handsets. The Moto G5 Plus, the Honor 7X, and the HTC U11 Life deliver all of those for anywhere from $100 to $250 less. If it's battery life you want, the Moto E4 Plus and the Asus ZenFone 4 Max clocked about 15 hours each in our testing, and still allow you to keep $250 in your pocket.The only reason you'd opt for the Motion over any one of those phones, then, are BlackBerry's software and security enhancements. Are they worth spending twice as much? It depends on who you are and what you're using the phone for.If you're a business customer, you'll likely appreciate the Motion's built-in malware-monitoring software, deep-rooted encryption, rapid adoption of Google's monthly security patches and the Productivity Hub. For everyone else, though, this BlackBerry is yet another very specialized phone with a very discerning user in mind.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
201,Alcatel Idol 5,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/alcatel-idol-5,review-4991.html","With all the excellent options out there for cheap, unlocked smartphones, prepaid carrier Cricket Wireless is hoping to attract customers with an exclusive: the Alcatel Idol 5. Reminiscent of the unlocked Idol 5S that launched earlier in the year for $279, that phone has been revised inside and out to hit a lower price tag: Cricket sells the Idol 5 for $179.The catch? Some of the concessions Alcatel made are sure to ruffle a few feathers. For one, there's no fingerprint scanner on the lower cost Idol 5, and the cheaper model features less RAM and an inferior processor. Yet Alcatel has slightly addressed the Idol 5S' battery life woes by throwing in a larger pack. Even so, the tradeoffs simply aren't worth it. Even with a sub-$200 price tag, you can still do better.The Alcatel Idol 5 is available for $179 exclusively through Cricket Wireless. For that price, you’ll get a device locked to the network, which uses parent company AT&T's GSM infrastructure. That means you won't be able to take the Idol 5 to T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint or any other service provider, including AT&T proper. Cricket's policy stipulates it will provide you with the unlock code after at least six months of paid service — only then will you be able to use the device on a different carrier. It's also important to note that while Cricket operates on AT&T's network, it caps data speeds at 8 Mbps.The Idol 5 comes in only one configuration with 32GB of storage, about half of which is available from the moment you boot up the phone for the first time. However, there is a microSD slot, allowing you to expand storage by up to 256GB.If you've seen the Idol 5S, the Idol 5 holds few surprises. The differences between the two models come down to fit and finish, rather than overall appearance.The phone's backside has undergone the most noticeable transformation. Alcatel has replaced the Idol 5S' glass rear panel with a bluish-silver aluminum enclosure that is rounder and more comfortable to hold. Atop this slab of metal sits the phone's 5.2-inch display, along with equally sized bezels above and below that house components like the front-facing camera and ambient light sensor.The metal frame still extends beyond the boundaries of the screen, and that's where you'll find the phone's earpiece and microphone that also double as stereo front-facing speakers. Along the right side below the volume rocker is the Boom key — a multifunction button that houses a number of shortcuts, which you can reprogram via the Settings menu.Overall, it's not a very fresh look anymore, considering Alcatel took the same approach with the Idol 3 and Idol 4. But it's still classy and unique, despite Cricket's obnoxious branding on the back. Budget buyers have been conditioned to expect disappointment in the design department, but the Idol 5's symmetrical aesthetic and gleaming, chamfered edges should leave customers with nothing to complain about.Well, almost nothing. There is that issue of the missing fingerprint sensor, which you'll find on the global version of the Idol 5 and Idol 5S, but not on this Cricket-exclusive U.S. model. The omission puts the device at a severe disadvantage compared with rivals like the Honor 7X and the Moto G5 Plus, that match or undercut the Idol 5's price while still delivering the essential security measure.Alcatel has once again gifted one of its budget offerings with a great display. The 5.2-inch full-HD LCD panel in the Idol 5 is ostensibly the same one we saw in the Idol 5S, except that older phone costs $100 more. It was a good screen for the money then, and even better now.The screen's greatest asset is its brightness. The Idol 5's panel reached 530 nits at its maximum setting when we measured it with our light meter, placing it comfortably above the 510-nit Honor 7X. Colorful, dynamic scenes look excellent on the Idol 5, as I discovered watching the first trailer for Ready Player One. If it's more saturation you're after, a Vivid option in the display settings will give you exactly that, though I found the standard profile intense enough.The Idol 5 reproduced 172 percent of the sRGB color gamut. That's impressive in comparison to the Moto G5 Plus' 106 percent, though the Idol's hues aren't quite as accurate. Whereas Motorola's phone achieved a Delta-E score of 0.94, the Alcatel managed 2.73. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.)In our review of the Idol 5S, we called its performance ""fine, but nothing special."" Unfortunately, the Idol 5 trades that phone's Snapdragon 625 processor for a slightly slower MediaTek Helio P20, and features a gigabyte less of RAM for a total of just 2GB. Worse than ""nothing special"" doesn't exactly instill confidence.Common tasks take just a hair longer on the Idol 5 than you'd hope. The scant amount of memory means apps don't remain in the background for very long, so you never know if they'll be ready for you at a moment's notice. When they aren't, you'll switch to an app and hang on the splash screen for half a second or more.Less demanding games, such as competitive endless runner Sonic Forces Speed Battle, run smoothly. But graphic-intensive titles didn't fare as well. Arcade racer Asphalt Nitro chugged along at a very low frame rate, rendering it unplayable.Still, in benchmark testing, the Idol 5 compared admirably to its rivals. Its 3,636 multi-core score in Geekbench 4 was just a hair behind the Moto G5 Plus, at 3,746. Graphics performance was also respectable, notching 13,094 in 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited. That's good enough to top the Honor 7X, at 11,586.If the Idol 5 has one definite advantage over its competition, though, it's NFC support. Most budget handsets, including the more expensive Idol 5S, lack NFC and thus cannot be used for Android Pay, so Alcatel should be applauded for including it here.Although other phones tout complex dual-camera arrays that blend monochrome sensors with different apertures and so on, Alcatel has taken a refreshingly simple approach with the Idol 5's photography capabilities.There's a 13-megapixel rear shooter with an f/2.0 aperture, and a 5-megapixel one for selfies. That's it.That might sound underwhelming by 2017 standards, but it's not a huge loss. Dual cameras in budget phones never quite prove their worth like the setups you get in higher-end models. During my time with the Idol 5, I didn't find myself wishing for a second lens — just some brighter shots.Compared with the Moto G5 Plus, the Idol 5 delivered consistently darker and cooler images, though it did win out regarding sharpness. The 12-MP Motorola failed to catch quite the same level of detail as the Alcatel, which is particularly evident in the above photo of a poodle. The wavy texture of the dog's hair comes across so much more clearly with the Idol 5.A similar effect is visible in the next series of pictures, which focuses on a park sign on a cloudy winter afternoon. Interestingly, HDR mode was activated on both phones, but the Idol 5 didn't seem to use it to any great effect. Facing away from the light, the sign is much more visible in the G5 Plus' rendition. Motorola's phone is able to pull so much more detail out of the shadows — something the Alcatel consistently struggled with.Like many budget phone cameras, the Idol 5 really leans on plentiful sunlight to produce good photos. In this pair of selfies taken on a much nicer day, the Idol 5 sported more realistic contrast and color, compared with the G5 Plus, and its highlights weren't nearly as blown out. I also prefer the Idol 5's narrower perspective and shorter depth of field, which is well suited for portraits.The Achilles' heel of the Idol 5S was its paltry 2,620 mAh battery. That handset delivered just 7 hours and 39 minutes in our battery test, which consisted of continuous web surfing on an LTE network. (T-Mobile's in the case of the unlocked 5S.)The Idol 5, which we tested on AT&T's network, is actually better endowed than its more expensive sibling in this regard. Alcatel has bumped up capacity to 2,850 mAh in the new model. Combined with the reduced amount of RAM and less powerful processor, we expected the Idol 5 to outlast the Idol 5S. It did, but not by much.The Idol 5 turned in a result of 8 hours and 50 minutes on our battery test. Although that's a step in the right direction, it still falls well short of the 9:40 smartphone average, not to mention budget category leaders like the Moto G5 Plus and the ZTE Blade V8 Pro, at 11:43 and 12:08, respectively.Thankfully, Alcatel's phone is quick to charge. The Idol 5 supports MediaTek's PumpExpress 2.0 protocol for faster charging. In our testing, the device reached 49 percent in just 30 minutes using the included adapter. Considering you'll have to top up the Idol 5 often, it's at least comforting to know it won't take very long.Once you strip away Cricket's bloatware, there's very little to differentiate the Idol 5's rendition of Android 7.0 Nougat from the stock OS. Rather, Alcatel is banking on virtual reality to set its latest budget offering apart.Alcatel says the Idol 5 is optimized for VR, and the company sells its own headset, the $49 UNI360. Like Google's Daydream VR, the UNI360 can be used with a multitude of phones, so long as they fall between 5 and 6 inches in size.As a pair, the Idol 5 and UNI360 have been pitched as an entry point for price-conscious consumers interested in VR. The phone is loaded with a wealth of VR content, ranging from Alcatel's VR Home interface to a VR Store for apps, Littlestar VR Cinema and VTime, which functions as a social network of sorts.The Idol 5s performance inside the headset is hit-or-miss. Movement tracking is usually responsive and lag-free. Yet, apps occasionally take a long time to boot up, and VR Home in particular briefly freezes when loading content from the web. Those are issues I can live with; the Idol 5’s real trouble with VR pertains to navigation.I've quit games only to be kicked back to the Android home screen, which is all but useless in VR. I've started apps and had to respond to permissions prompts, which never display properly, forcing me to remove the phone from the apparatus. The back and select buttons located on the top of the headset seem to randomly swap responsibilities, and on one occasion, the back button wasn't responsive at all until I restarted the device. If Alcatel wants to entice customers with VR, it will have to ensure a more consistent experience first.As far as Android 8.0 Oreo availability is concerned, Alcatel has told us it has nothing to share at the moment. Considering the Idol 5 isn't even running the still outdated 7.1 version of Nougat, the prospect for future updates to a more current OS doesn't look good.There are certainly worse budget phones than the Idol 5. Given the wealth of alternatives that deliver better value, though, there's no reason to settle.For $200 or so, you could afford an Honor 7X, ZTE Blade V8 Pro or Moto G5 Plus, and never have to worry about battery life or performance. You could even save some cash and opt for the incredibly long-lasting Moto E4 Plus. Best of all, you'd have the freedom to take your phone to the network that suits you, rather than being chained to Cricket and its perpetually throttled data speeds.Meanwhile, if you're married to the Idol 5's design, the Idol 5S for $279 (or $199 as an Amazon Prime Exclusive with lock-screen ads) greatly benefits from improved specs across the board — not to mention a fingerprint sensor. It's definitely on the expensive side, but at least it doesn't force you to make so many compromises.Credit: Tom's Guide"
202,T-Mobile Revvl Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/t-mobile-revvl-plus,review-4957.html","You'd be forgiven for missing the memo that T-Mobile is now selling its own line of smartphones: the 5.5-inch Revvl and now the 6-inch Revvl Plus, which are made by Alcatel. With so many name-brand devices to choose from, though, why turn to a phone that locks you into a specific carrier?T-Mobile senses your skepticism, which is why the company bundled some premium specs into the Revvl Plus while holding the price at $200. Unfortunately, lackluster implementation means that T-Mobile's hardware won't shake up the industry the way the company's wireless plans have.Budget phones have jumped on board with high-end features such as dual-lens cameras and biometric identification. But where phone makers cut costs is typically in design and build quality, and the T-Mobile Revvl Plus is no exception.This $200 phone is a chunk of black plastic that extends close to 6.5 inches long, which makes it just about impossible to use one-handed. The back is slightly textured, and touching it feels like running your fingers over a vinyl record, which I have to confess is not a pleasant experience. Touching this phone felt weird. You know when you hear nails down a chalkboard and you immediately get the shivers? Gripping this phone was like that, giving me a full-body feeling of ick. Your mileage may vary, but I wish T-Mobile had chosen a different material.A few not-so-terrible stylistic elements set the back of the Revvl Plus apart. T-Mobile added its signature splash of fuchsia in the form of the company logo and a vibrant pink ring around both the camera and fingerprint sensor, which are stacked on top of each other.But the Revvl Plus sports a micro USB charger instead of USB-C. That, along with the phone's aging version of Android Nougat, makes this feel like a 2016 phone instead of a device future-proofed for the year to come.Screen Size (Resolution): 6 inches (1920 x 1080 pixels) Size: 6.49 x 3.24 x 0.34 inches Weight: 6.88 ounces CPU: Snapdragon 625 RAM: 2GB Storage: 32GB microSD: Yes Rear Cameras: 13MP/5MP Front Camera: 8MP Battery Life (Hrs:Min): 11:03Forget how the Revvl Plus looks. If all you care about is getting powerful performance without paying a premium, look no further.Equipped with Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor, the Revvl Plus scored 3,783 on the Geekbench 4 test of overall system performance, crushing lower-priced competing devices like the Blade Z Max and Moto E4 Plus, which both use lower-powered Qualcomm mobile processors.More impressively, the Revvl Plus even bested the more expensive Moto G5 Plus, which also sports a Snapdragon 625 processor while packing in twice the RAM of T-Mobile's phone. (That said, the G5 Plus and its more expensive sibling, the G5S Plus, are expected to receive the Android Oreo update, while the Revvl Plus will presumably chug along on Nougat for its entire life span.)When it comes to graphics and gaming performance, the Revvl Plus nips at the heels of the G5 Plus, with a 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark score of 13,759 versus the G5's 13,862. Phones under $300 rarely perform this well, let alone phones that barely crack $200.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesThe Revvl Plus performed just as well in real life as it did on a spec sheet. I slammed my Ford Focus into other race cars on the streets of Real Racing 3 without any lag. However, the icky feeling of the Revvl's vinyl-esque back was distracting.The Revvl Plus comes with just one storage option, 32GB, but you can expand that up to 128GB with a microSD card. Six T-Mobile apps take up some of that space out of the box, which is slightly annoying, but to be expected.The Revvl Plus is a behemoth, and the 6-inch full HD (1920 x 1080) LCD panel takes up most of that real estate.The screen is on par with those of other phones at this price point, such as the Blade Z Max and Moto E4 Plus. Using a light meter, we found that the Revvl Plus reaches a peak brightness of 506 nits, which is higher than the smartphone average of 433 nits.The Revvl Plus display covers 117 percent of the sRGB color gamut and has impressive color accuracy, with a Delta-E score of 0.32. (Numbers closer to zero are better.) The E4 Plus tops the Revvl Plus, with a 0.26 Delta-E rating, but has a smaller, dimmer display overall.The Revvl Plus' giant 6-inch screen is perfect for gaming or watching videos of any kind. This experience is not as immersive as streaming content on an edge-to-edge display like the one on the Galaxy Note 8 — which also costs hundreds of dollars more — but I was enthralled by the Black Panther trailer's vibrant imagery on the Revvl Plus.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe Revvl Plus display doesn't fare as well outdoors. Trying to capture photos in daylight was difficult, because the subjects were dimmer on screen than they should have been.After the original Revvl shipped with a lone rear camera, T-Mobile upgraded the larger Revvl Plus with a dual-lens camera system. The second lens enables a portrait-mode effect that has become more common on premium smartphones but is now trickling down to budget models, too.But there's a difference between a high-end phone with dual lenses, such as the iPhone 8 Plus or Samsung Galaxy Note 8, and a lower-priced model like the Revvl Plus. That difference comes down to portrait-mode execution.The Revvl Plus uses its rear-facing 13-megapixel and 5-MP lenses to create a bokeh effect, in which the subject of a photo is brought into focus and the background is blurred. This effect adds a DSLR-level quality to smartphone photography — or at least it's supposed to. I was unimpressed by the Revvl Plus' version of portrait mode, which was unreliable. In a photo I took of two dogs meeting each other at the farmers' market, both pups were blurred instead of the background.In a photo of seasonal flower arrangements at the market, the Revvl Plus camera brought some of the background florals into focus, too, while blurring out others. I was unimpressed.The Plus' 8-MP front-facing camera did a decent job when I was shooting selfies. The phone comes with an optional Beauty filter that could be bumped up if you want to smooth out lines, enlarge the eyes, slim the face or whiten the skin (yes, whiten — really, T-Mobile?).The phone also attempts to guess your age and offers compliments, but the age was always off and the compliments were bizarre. The Revvl Plus alternately called me a nymph and Mr. McDreamy. Again — really, T-Mobile? I don't like these cameras. At all.The Revvl Plus sports a 3,380-mAh battery that lasted an impressive 11 hours and 3 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which drains the battery by surfing the web continuously over T-Mobile's LTE. The T-Mobile phone missed out on a place in our list of longest-lasting smartphones by just a few minutes.But the Revvl comes close to matching rival devices that have larger batteries, such as ZTE's Blade Z Max (11:23). And the T-Mobile phone easily bests similarly priced phones that have smaller batteries, such as LG's K20 Plus (9:43). The Revvl is also on par with some elite company; the much more expensive Galaxy S8+ lasted just a minute longer than the Revvl Plus on our test, for example.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery Life - Tom's GuideT-Mobile promises that you'll get up to 16.5 hours of talk time or up to 12 days of standby time with the Revvl Plus, which we can't guarantee. However, you will get more than a day of mixed use before needing a charge, which is all we ask for from a smartphone.Not surprisingly, T-Mobile's Revvl Plus is locked to the network, which might knock this device out of the running for many smartphone shoppers who don't want to use T-Mobile's wireless service. (They should consider it, though, if T-Mobile provides good coverage in their area. We rank T-Mobile just behind Verizon among overall carriers, and we consider T-Mobile the best value among wireless providers thanks to its fairly priced unlimited-data plans.)For T-Mobile customers, the Revvl Plus is a great deal: $200 up front or $9 a month on the carrier's Jump! On Demand program.On paper, the Revvl Plus sounds pretty amazing. It has great specs for a $200 phone, including a powerful Snapdragon 625 processor that makes streaming videos and playing games a breeze.But the dual-lens camera doesn't quite pull off the popular bokeh effect, and the bizarre Beauty filter fails to impress, even though both modes are optional. Why does T-Mobile offer camera effects that fall short?Ultimately, the Revvl Plus is a carrier-branded phone competing with other, more-capable budget devices. Whether you buy in depends on how devoted you are to T-Mobile and how much you depend on your smartphone's camera. If the answers to those questions are ""not very"" and ""a lot,"" respectively, the comparably priced Moto G5 Plus may be a better choice.The unpleasantly textured backplate, uneven camera effects and T-Mobile tie-in make this device a pass for most smartphone buyers.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
203,ZTE Axon M,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/zte-axon-m,review-4905.html","The dream of dual-screen phones refuses to die. Every now and then, an enterprising phone maker rolls out a wild new contraption — sometimes with a plethora of hinges, other times with a second display on the back purely for notifications and other glanceable bits of information. There's no blueprint for how these devices should work, so the execution often varies dramatically.Enter the ZTE Axon M, the latest attempt by a major global player in the industry to capitalize on that never-ending desire to do more. In one sense, the Axon M achieves that ideal, allowing users to run a pair of apps side by side — and in perfect harmony much of the time. But it's the basics where this hulking beast of a handset falters, with a subpar camera and battery, and a flawed combination of software and hardware, which leads to a sea of headaches.The ZTE Axon M costs $725 and is available exclusively from AT&T. There is only one configuration, with 64GB of storage, though the phone does accept microSD cards, so you can add up to 256GB of extra capacity.There's no avoiding it: The Axon M is a brick of a phone. This handset is about half an inch thick, so you could stack two Moto Z2 Forces next to it, and they'd be about even with ZTE's behemoth. Tipping the scale at half a pound, the Axon M's got a noticeable heft, too. But folded up, it's not quite as unwieldy to navigate with one hand as I was expecting.Eventually, we'll see truly foldable smartphones touting flexible displays that can bend and twist without the need for a physical hinge, as Samsung's long-rumored Galaxy X might do. But until then, we have the Axon M, a traditional, clamshell-style handset, only with its screens on the outside.This means the two sides of the phone look virtually the same, the only difference being the device's lone 20-megapixel camera and earpiece, situated in the top bezel above the main display. The front and back of the phone are both coated in Gorilla Glass 5 and are bonded to a robust, rectangular aluminum frame. The hinge bulges out slightly along the right edge when you hold the phone folded in, though that actually makes the handset easier to grip for those of us who are right-handed.The hinge itself feels very sturdy and reveals the second screen with a satisfying click. While I'm not entirely convinced that the Axon M makes a great argument for dual-screen phones, the companies that follow in ZTE's footsteps should take note of the attention to build-quality here. This phone feels premium and properly engineered — a Kyocera Echo this is not.Folded out, the Axon M's two panels combine into a 6.5-inch display. It's nearly a perfect square, with a resolution of 2160 x 1920, though that's broken up by the hinge down the center. The divide isn't especially important unless you're using the phone in Extended mode, in which one app spreads across both screens.The bezels to the left and right are almost nonexistent, but the forehead and chin are exceptionally large. This is likely because ZTE had to stuff a full-scale camera and flash where a front-facing shooter would typically go.Opposite the hinge, you'll find a power button equipped with a fingerprint sensor, a volume rocker and a programmable key that's designed to take you to a media app of your choosing.,You can actually redirect it to any app, though. Along the top of the Axon M is a headphone jack, and at the bottom are a USB-C port and two speakers, which work in tandem with the earpiece to deliver stereo audio equipped with Dolby Atmos surround sound.For the most part, the Axon M is as well-designed as you'd hope a dual-screen smartphone could be, save for one serious flaw. Despite all of this phone's scratch-resistant glass, when we set our Axon M down on a stone ledge, it immediately came away with nasty scuffs on three corners. Given that cases for this phone will probably be rare (aside from a plastic offering from ZTE that leaves the hinge exposed), this looks to be an unavoidable casualty of the screen-facing design ZTE opted for. It's simply something owners will have to live with.ZTE, fortunately, has made it very easy to break out that second screen: Simply flip open the device and press the ""M"" key stationed in the navigation bar.From there, you're offered three modes: Dual Mode, which presents different apps on each display; Extended Mode, which combines both displays to show one app; and Mirror Mode, which produces an identical image on both screens. That latter mode can be helpful for letting other people in a room see the same things that you see.But it’s Dual Mode that’s unquestionably the most useful implementation. Having access to Google Maps and Yelp side by side makes finding a lunch spot much easier. Ditto for answering texts when you don't want to put the brakes on a YouTube video you're already watching. Both screens remain simultaneously responsive, and ZTE has also included a few gestures, like a three-finger swipe across the center, to move apps from one panel to the other.Extended Mode, however, presents problems. The hinge is simply too much of a nuisance. Most apps tend to work better when the phone is held horizontally, like a Nintendo DS, so that the hinge doesn't impede left-to-right reading. But many apps aren't optimized to be used this way, and even the ones that are — like Facebook — don't use the extra real estate to any clear advantage. Despite the more tablet-like form factor of this phone, you're pretty much left with widened phone apps, which don't particularly look or feel better to navigate. And good luck if you have to tap a hard-to-reach button that's between the two screens, partially obscured by the gap..But the one thing you certainly never want to do is use Extended Mode for viewing media. The aspect ratio of both displays combined is close to a square, which means 16:9 content gets heavily letterboxed, to the point that the size is just marginally larger than if you were watching that same video on a single screen. These kind of experiences make you wonder why ZTE and AT&T are pushing entertainment so hard on this device, when the Axon M performs much better as a tool for productivity-minded power users.Speaking of entertainment, AT&T has loaded the Axon M with a glut of bloatware, from the DirecTV Now app (which cannot be disabled, mind you) to a trio of games, Yelp, Facebook, Uber and a suite of 10 carrier apps. Also, you can add ZTE's latest to the list of new smartphones with Android 8.0 Oreo promised at a later date, as the phone comes equipped with 7.1.2 Nougat out of the box. It's not heavily skinned, but there's no ignoring the ""AT&T"" carrier identifier that persists in the notification bar, no matter how little space there is up there when you're using only one screen.Overall, the dual-display features are easy enough to operate and understand, but use cases that truly legitimize them are few and far between. To make the outlook even murkier, the Axon M simply doesn't handle switching modes well. There's often a 2-second delay any time you enter Dual Mode, and if you shut the second display while the phone is using it, you can end up in some pretty strange situations. At one point, I had Facebook and Google Maps fighting for space on the main display before the phone sorted itself out.For a phone with two screens, the Axon M left me with little to say about its pair of 5.2-inch 1080p LCD panels. They're remarkably average, with underwhelming brightness and colors that don't really pop, although the small screen size means that the full-HD resolution is sufficient for a sharp picture.The Axon M re-created 100.2 percent of the sRGB gamut in our testing and notched a Delta-E color-accuracy score of 0.22. (Numbers closer to 0 are better in that latter test.) Those scores mean images are quite realistic, though if you prefer more-vibrant hues, the Axon M doesn't offer alternate viewing modes. It's a strange omission on a handset intended for watching television and movies.The Axon M's peak full-screen brightness faltered, registering just 394 nits on our light meter. That's well below the 433-nit average for smartphones, and more typical of an OLED screen than a conventional LCD panel.Strangely, with its Snapdragon 821 processor, the Axon M is powered by the same silicon as 2016's Pixel and the LG G6 released earlier this year. This puts ZTE's device a year behind the current crop of frontline Android flagships, which are powered by the Snapdragon 835. Unfortunately, you can feel the gap in processing power as you put the Axon M through its paces.The Axon M performs adequately when only one screen is used, but fold the device out, and there's always the potential for some slowdown. Apps can occasionally hang and cease responding to taps for brief moments, or refuse to open for several seconds. The 4GB of RAM helps keep recent apps in memory, so they're right where you left them when you switch to Dual Mode, for example. But overall, the Axon M never feels quite as swift as other phones in its price range.In Geekbench 4, which tests overall performance, the Axon M managed a multicore score of 4,354. That's a bit higher than the first-generation Pixel's 4,176, but handily behind the Pixel 2's 6,282. The Axon M is actually about on par with the just-released Moto X4 Android One, a midrange handset running Qualcomm's Snapdragon 630 processor, which achieved 4,122.Graphics performance was similarly serviceable, as 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark produced a score of 30,059. For reference, the Galaxy S8 achieved 36,508. Gamers, be advised that not all titles will work across the Axon M's display modes. For example, Injustice 2 played well on one screen, but attempting to run the title in the Expanded or Dual configurations stopped the game dead in its tracks, forcing the app to close. Meanwhile, Big Farm, a much less demanding title that comes preinstalled on the phone, ran perfectly in all cases.The Axon M's 20-megapixel, f/1.8 camera sits above the main display, facing the user, and is the only camera you'll find anywhere on the device. When you want to take a picture of something in front of you, ZTE's camera app instructs you to turn the phone around and use the secondary screen.You'll have to build muscle memory for flipping the phone every time you want to swap perspectives. I can't tell you how many times I pressed the button that would be reserved for switching to the back camera on any other smartphone, only to find myself staring at a blank screen for 5 seconds before realizing I needed to spin the whole thing around.You'd think, then, that with only one camera, ZTE could concentrate on making this shooter the absolute best. And yet, the Axon M's camera lacks optical image stabilization, a key ingredient in any true flagship camera. Considering that the phone is the exact same price as a Galaxy S8, we were keen to compare the two, but the Samsung device demonstrated its superiority very quickly.Both phones' HDR modes were utilized for this scene of the Abraham Lincoln statue in Union Square in New York, and the first thing you notice is how washed out and overblown the Axon M's rendition is. Ideally, HDR should curb this, by combining the shadows and highlights from different exposures to generate a more balanced image. But the tops of the buildings in the background are absolutely scorched by the sun here, and the steep gradient of the sky is unnatural. Combined with the cooler tint, those results make this picture look like it came from a phone that costs hundreds less.The outlook somewhat improved for this photo of pumpkins from one of the park vendors. The Axon M's higher megapixel count helps it achieve a sharper overall image, though we prefer the shallower depth of field offered by the Galaxy S8. Again, the ZTE demonstrates a blue cast that doesn't do this late afternoon scene justice.The Axon M's selfie situation is interesting. Because this phone uses the same camera for all scenarios, you can take portraits of yourself that look considerably sharper than what you're likely to get from any other phone. The Galaxy S8's front-facing shooter simply can't match the clarity of the Axon M's shot, and I also prefer the subtle blur in the background that ZTE provides. The dual-screened phone may not be particularly gifted in the camera category, but its selfie game puts other phones to shame.Powering the Axon M is a 3,180-mAh battery burdened with the unenviable task of lighting two screens. But even with just one display active, ZTE's flagship can't match the endurance of other flagships.In our battery test, which consisted of continuous web surfing on AT&T's LTE network, the Axon M lasted just 8 hours and 58 minutes. That's with only one display active, mind you, and the result pales in comparison to the Galaxy S8's time of 10:39. And that phone has a smaller, 3,000-mAh battery. Using the Axon M's second display accelerates depletion, as you would expect, and we are currently conducting another test in Dual Mode to quantify the effect.In terms of charging speed, the Axon M does support Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 protocol in its stock adapter, though this mode didn't seem to make a significant difference when we plugged the phone in at 0 percent. In 30 minutes of being connected to an outlet, the Axon M reached only 19 percent, which doesn't indicate any fast charging at all. Quick Charge 3.0 isn't Qualcomm's latest iteration of the technology, but considering some devices can use it to reach 60 percent in the same time, the Axon M should top up faster than this.I may have had my reservations about the Axon M, but it was a device I wanted to love. ZTE is taking a big gamble, designing a phone that other companies have been too hesitant to take on. Unfortunately, the device ends up being a gimmick that struggles to prove its worth outside of a few rare scenarios here and there.Using the Axon M is simply too frustrating an experience, too much of the time. The last-gen processor simply isn't up to the task, and until flexible displays hit the market, that hinge is going to serve as one ugly deal-breaker. The software does a serviceable job of keeping most of the popular apps humming along, but some don't handle being shuffled from screen to screen well, and they will slow everything down to a crawl.It will take a whole new approach to design and a thoughtful, extensive reimagining of how Android fundamentally operates to make a dual-screen or foldable smartphone work. That goes for not only for ZTE, but also any phone maker that follows in its footsteps. Sadly, the Axon M isn't that device; for all of its entertainment aspirations, it's a pilot episode that's not quite ready for prime time.Credit: Tom's Guide"
204,Cat S41,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/cat-s41,review-4814.html","Fortunately, the $449 Cat S41 is here to fill the void. Another smartphone from the famed producer of construction machinery, the S41 is actually produced by Bullitt Group, the same company that designed the Kodak Ektra. If you're in a particularly demanding line of work or need a phone that can withstand nature's harshest elements, the S41 won't let you down. Just don't use it to share pictures of your next vacation.The Cat S41 costs $449 and features 32GB of internal storage, paired with 3GB of RAM. The phone is only sold unlocked, but you can still take it to GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile; CDMA networks, such as Verizon and Sprint, are not compatible. You can preorder it now from Cat's website, with delivery slated for Nov. 16, or pick it up from the likes of Best Buy and Amazon.There are tough phones, and then there's the Cat S41. Clad in hard plastic and a textured rubberized material around the sides and back, the S41 doesn't try to play down its rugged roots like the Galaxy S8 Active does. It's not particularly elegant, but then, that's not the point.Weighing nearly 8 ounces, the S41 is hefty, even though it only houses a 5-inch display. It's also quite thick, measuring half an inch. This can make the phone difficult to grasp for those with small hands, though the grippy material somewhat mitigates the unwieldiness. It's like having a heavy-duty case on your phone at all times.Gorilla Glass 5 makes the screen almost as strong as the rest of the phone, though the display attracts fingerprints like nobody's business. Fortunately, CAT provides a screen protector in the box for extra piece of mind. All of the phone's ports (including the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack) are given protective flaps to ensure water resistance, which is a key aspect of the design.The best waterproofing most phones can hope to achieve is IP68 — good for 5 feet of submersion for 30 minutes. This is what you'll get from both the LG X venture and Galaxy S8 Active. The S41 fares a bit better, though. Thanks to those flaps, CAT's handset can survive under 6.5 feet of water for an hour.It can take a fall, too. The S41 adheres to the military's MIL-STD-810 standard for durability, and is built to brush off 6-foot-high drops onto concrete. A tumble onto the sidewalk only left our unit with scrapes on the corners; the display remained blemish free and the phone functioned perfectly well afterward.Those who frequently wear gloves will appreciate CAT's decision to go with chunky physical navigation buttons below the display, as well as a programmable multifunction key on the left side. Unlike the Bixby button on the Galaxy S8 series, this gold key can be customized to launch specific apps and features, like the flashlight and answering calls.Sadly however, amidst the assortment of buttons, a fingerprint sensor is nowhere to be found. You could argue Cat's target audience might not have exposed fingerprints to give, but both the X venture and S8 Active have sensors, putting the S41 at a disadvantage.Besides adding protective cover, the S41's bulkiness also houses a beefy 5,000-mAh battery, which provides enough juice to make this one of the longest-lasting smartphones we've ever tested. The Cat S41 lasted 15 hours and 19 minutes in our Tom's Guide Battery Test, which consisted of continuous website streaming over AT&T LTE.The Cat S41's battery does more than just last, however. Cat includes a Battery Share feature that effectively transforms the phone into an external power pack. To make it work, you'll have to use the Battery Share dongle that comes with the phone and plugthat dongle into the S41, rather than the device you're charging. Power will flow from the phone to the second device, and you can even set a minimum reserve on the S41, so that you don't run the handset's battery completely dry.The S41 lacks wireless charging, but it does support fast charging with the included Pump Express 2.0 wall adapter. Pump Express is MediaTek's counterpart to Qualcomm's Quick Charge technology, though 2.0 is actually an outdated standard — newer devices sport Pump Express 3.0. Still, it helps the S41 fill up 45 percent faster than it would without fast charging.The S41's 5-inch, full-HD LCD display is surprisingly quite nice, even if it's part of a durability-first handset. The first thing you notice is how bright the screen is — 595 nits when turned all the way up, which blows away the 433-nit smartphone average and even surpasses the Moto G5 Plus at 591 nits.Side by side with the just-released $399 Moto X4, which also has a similarly sized 1080p LCD panel, the S41 depicted slightly more saturated colors during a viewing of the latest Justice League trailer, but poorer white balance and more muted contrast left room for improvement.In testing, the S41 reproduced 116.6 percent of the sRGB spectrum and turned in a Delta-E color accuracy score of 1.46 (numbers closer to 0 are better). Neither of these are necessarily class-leading results, but the S41's screen mostly holds its own against the best LCD displays at this price point — a welcome surprise.There's no such thing as a really great camera in a $400 smartphone. That said, the S41's 13-megapixel shooter is so bad, it makes most mediocre budget handsets look like iPhones and Pixels by comparison.We stacked up the S41 against LG's X venture, a not-quite-as-rugged, but still pretty sturdy, $329 device exclusive to AT&T. The X venture's 16-MP camera crushed CAT's best efforts, particularly with a superior HDR mode.As a rule of thumb, never use HDR on the S41, or you'll get results like what you see above. The S41's exposure is downright hazy, washed out and completely devoid of proper contrast. It fails to rein in the highlights — particularly the light picked up by the flowers — and lacks the subtle background blur of the LG phone's shot.The S41 doesn't know what to do with concentrated sources of light, but thankfully, it fares a little better once you leave the shadows. These scenes from a beautiful day in New York absolutely pop on the X venture, with better white balance, more vibrant hues, well-lit shadows and overall sharper detail. The S41's attempt is noticeably more drab, but with HDR off, at least it's not a bleached mess.Driving the S41 is MediaTek's Helio P20, a chipset roughly on par with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 625; the phone also features 3GB of RAM. That's a solid combination for a midrange phone, though I ran into some small areas of concern in day-to-day usage.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe S41 takes a hair longer than it should to boot up, but once it's ready, it performs admirably most of the time. Juggling apps, browsing Chrome, snapping photos and streaming YouTube videos never posed any issues, though navigating Google Maps wasn't as smooth as on other, similarly specced devices. Playing first-person-shooter N.O.V.A. Legacy and arcade classic Crazy Taxi weren't any trouble, so you can expect the S41 to handle some light gaming or tasks that similarly tax the CPU.On Geekbench 4, which tests overall performance, the S41 managed a score of 3,221 — a far cry from the Moto X4's 4,122, but much better than the LG X venture's measly 2,613. The S41 also totaled 12,892 on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test, again placing it between the Moto X4 and LG X venture at 16,815 and 8,290, respectively. Still, if you want a rugged phone that makes no sacrifices in speed and power, look to Samsung's Galaxy S8 Active instead, which capitalized on its Snapdragon 835 processor to smoke the S41 on both tests.As busy as its exterior is, the S41's user experience is remarkably spartan. The phone runs Android 7.1 Nougat, and that's it; there's no unnecessary manufacturer skin and almost no bloatware. The only nonstock apps you'll find are OfficeSuite, Battery Share and Cat's App Toolbox — the latter of which offers a curated selection of rugged software, from popular navigation app Waze to more specialized tools like an electrical calculator and an app to help cattle breeders.We like that Cat kept it simple, rather than fussing with Android. And the features the S41 does add, like Underwater Mode and the programmable-key functions, should be useful to exactly the kinds of buyers the company is courting. We reached out to the company to determine if an update to Android 8.0 Oreo is waiting in the wings, and we'll update this review as soon as we know more.Few smartphones are built to suffer the kinds of abuse the S41 can handle and still hit a reasonable price point. CAT has done a commendable job of bringing that durability to the midrange market without making too many sacrifices. This is a decently performing handset with almost incomparable battery life, and for the right customer, it definitely suits a need.But unless you spend a lot of time on a construction site or in the unforgiving outdoors, away from a wall outlet, the S41 doesn't make much sense. A number of competitors, from the Moto E4 Plus and G5 Plus to ZTE's Blade V8 Pro, provide faster performance — and, especially — better cameras for hundreds less. CAT's offering is surprisingly well-rounded compared to other tough phones, like Kyocera's less powerful yet more expensive DuraForce Pro, but it's still not for everyone.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
205,Moto X4 Android One,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-x4-android-one,review-4767.html","Before the modular Moto Z, there was the Moto X — Motorola's flagship smartphone that combined a completely customizable design with high-end internals and stock Android at its best. It's been two years since we've seen a new phone in the range, and now the name is making a return in the form of the Moto X4.Interestingly, the latest X shares very little with its predecessors. Whereas those phones were true flagships with the best hardware available at the time, the Moto X4 is now aimed at midrange buyers. Starting at $399, it costs less than half as much as Samsung's Galaxy S8 Plus.Like the rest of the phones in Motorola's roster, the Moto X4 is reasonably priced for what it offers, particularly if you want Google's Project Fi wireless service. But when compared to value powerhouses like the OnePlus 5, the X4 will leave you wanting more.The U.S. version of the Moto X4 has 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM. The standard version of the phone is available for preorder now and will hit retailers on Oct. 26. Via its Prime Exclusives program, Amazon will offer a discounted version of the X4 in exchange for lock-screen ads.However, there's yet another version of the phone, called the Moto X4 Android One, and that's the model we've tested here. (We plan to review the standard X4 once we get our hands on that version.)The Android One variant is almost the same as the standard model, but it has a key difference: support for Google's Project Fi wireless network. Project Fi operates on a prepaid system, similar to the way Cricket Wireless or Metro PCS work, though users pay only for the data they use.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesIn gaining Project Fi compatibility, the Android One version of the Moto X4 also loses a few features — notably, Amazon Alexa integration and some of Motorola's convenient gesture controls.If you've seen any of Motorola's 2017 handsets, you've pretty much seen the Moto X4. When you compare the X4 side by side with the recently released G5S Plus and range-topping Z2 Force, it's remarkably difficult to tell the three phones apart. They all have the same general shape, chunky bezels, curved glass and oval-shaped fingerprint scanner.It's only when you turn the phones over that you begin to pick up on the subtle differences. The back of the Moto X4 is shrouded in ultrashiny glass, which tapers off at the edges to smoothly meet the matte aluminum frame. It's a good look and, fortunately, instills the phone with a premium feel despite the aged design.In spite of those details, you can't miss the massive dual-camera module in the center of the phone's backside. Motorola has once again packaged both lenses into a circular housing, and it looks gaudy.While it doesn't stick out quite as prominently as the one on the G5S Plus or the Z2 Force, the camera module is still larger than it needs to be. As much as I appreciate that Motorola strove to make its devices more distinctive, this isn't the way to do it.Unlike many of its more expensive counterparts, the Moto X4 does not boast an OLED screen. Rather, it features a 5.2-inch full-HD LCD panel. That's perfectly fine for a midrange product, but you shouldn't expect to be blown away.When I watched the Black Panther trailer on YouTube, the X4 displayed a slightly cool tint and seemed a little washed out overall. It's nothing particularly unusual compared to other LCD screens, but a second viewing on the OnePlus 5's OLED panel reminded me what I was missing. The Moto X4's contrast simply can't measure up.At least the X4's screen is very bright. Our light meter showed 513 nits from the Moto X4's display, handily beating the 413-nit smartphone average. It reproduced 128.0 percent of the sRGB color spectrum — a wide swath for an LCD display. Color accuracy was solid as well, with the Moto X4 managing a Delta E rating of 0.62 (numbers closer to 0 are better). Moto's own G5S Plus delivered a superior 0.29 result, despite costing nearly $200 less.In terms of smartphone design, 2017 will probably go down as the year dual cameras became simultaneously ubiquitous and almost worthless. And we have devices like the Moto X4 to thank for that.Of course, some handsets use their second cameras to great effect, as anyone who's enjoyed the privilege of shooting with an iPhone 8 Plus or Samsung Galaxy Note 8 can attest. Unfortunately, the technology simply hasn't translated well to cheaper devices yet. Unless you're spending good money, a plurality of lenses typically means improperly focused depth-of-field shots or blurry, smeary wide-angle landscapes.The Moto X4 is guilty on both counts. The phone's primary sensor is rated at 12 megapixels, with an f/2.0 aperture. The secondary, 8-megapixel camera has a wide-angle lens with a 120-degree field of view. Neither produces particularly impressive results.Compare the Motorola's portrait-style efforts above to shots from the OnePlus 5, and it's immediately clear that the X4 cannot adequately identify the boundaries of the figure in the foreground. This results in oversoftened edges that bleed into regions that should remain in focus, completely betraying the authenticity of the effect.Still, the second lens on the X4 has one advantage over the OnePlus 5: It can capture ever-expansive wide-angle shots most phones can't. This is probably the greatest strength of the Moto X4's photography, though images taken with this sensor lack the clarity and crispness of those taken using the primary lens.The primary lens is nearly as middling. These shots taken at Brooklyn's Navy Yard utilize HDR mode on both phones, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the Moto X4's dim exposure. The OnePlus 5's attempt features greater detail overall, and retains much more visibility in the darker sections, which is particularly evident in the text on the walls on the left and the shadows cast on the building straight ahead. Not to mention, the OnePlus 5's shutter acted much more quickly every time we pressed the button.The same story goes for the 16-MP front-facing camera. Notice how the Moto X4 completely misses the texture on the interior of my jacket's collar.The phone fails again in its grainy execution of the low-light scene below. While the Moto X4's white balance is preferable, the OnePlus 5's version is far less grainy.The Moto X4 is decently fast, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 630 processor, paired with 3GB of RAM, is the reason why. There were no hiccups as I played Madden NFL Mobile, explored the world of Epic Citadel or streamed Bluetooth audio while navigating Google Maps.There's little use in comparing the Moto X4 to the OnePlus 5 in this category — the OnePlus 5 clearly smokes it, thanks to its much faster Snapdragon 835 processor and twice the RAM. That's the same chip featured in such high-end offerings as the Galaxy S8, Google Pixel 2 and Essential Phone.A fairer opponent would actually be one of Motorola's budget offerings. The recently reviewed $279 G5S Plus has a slightly less powerful Snapdragon 625 chipset, and in testing the Moto X4 barely outpaced it.MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowThe Moto X4 turned in a score of 4,122 on Geekbench 4, which measures overall system performance. That beats the G5S Plus' score of 3,746. The X4 also edged out the G5S Plus in terms of graphics capabilities, delivering a score of 16,815 on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark, compared with 13,805 from the G5S Plus.Those are modest gains, but the Moto X4 claims a number of improvements outside of sheer specs muscle. It has near-field communication for Android Pay, as well as IP68 water resistance and 32GB of onboard storage as standard. As with the G5S Plus, there's a microSD slot, which is compatible with memory cards up to 2TB.The Moto X4 makes its fair share of compromises, but battery life isn't one of them. The phone clocked 11 hours and 41 minutes on our Tom's Guide Battery Test, which, in this case, was conducted by endlessly loading web pages on Project Fi's cobbled-together LTE network.Project Fi combines T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular's towers for better coverage than any one of those networks can deliver on its alone. The Moto X4 Android One edition supports Project Fi out of the box, but it isn't locked to it — for example, you can still take the phone to a different network. When we conducted the same battery test with an AT&T SIM card inside, the runtime was nearly 2 hours shorter — 9 hours and 50 minutes.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeBetween Project Fi's power-friendly service and the 3,000-mAh battery inside, the Moto X4 delivers great longevity while being quick to charge. Simply plug the phone in with the provided TurboPower adapter for 15 minutes, and you'll have 6 hours of juice.The Moto X4 is an Android One device, and normally, that would mean it runs the stock configuration of Google's operating system. The Moto X4 is slightly different, though. There's Android 7.1.1 Nougat on board — Motorola says the phone will get an Oreo update before the end of 2017 — but it's largely the same experience you'd encounter on any of Motorola's non-Android One phones.That's not necessarily a problem, considering Motorola's interface tweaks tend to be light, simple and elegant. But there are two features missing from the Android One version that we would have liked to see make the jump.The first is One Button Nav. Just like the Moto E4 Plus, G5 Plus and G5S Plus, the X4 typically includes an app called Moto Actions, which contains handy gestures for improving overall usability. In the X4, this includes Motorola's usual roster of shortcuts, like three-finger tap for screenshots, chop twice for the flashlight and twist twice for the camera.Yet the Android One variant of the Moto X4 is missing One Button Nav, which utilizes the fingerprint sensor in place of the standard Android navigation bar. With One Button Nav on, the sensor becomes the home button, swiping back replaces the dedicated back button, and swiping right brings up the recent-apps list. It's convenient once you get used to it; not to mention, it frees up a decent chunk of screen space normally unavailable to apps.MORE: 10 Reasons Android Beats the iPhoneAlso absent in the Android One version is integration with Amazon's Alexa. The Moto X4 is the first phone to launch with Alexa since the HTC U11, and it's no surprise that Google axed it from the Android One version of the phone. But many people rely on Alexa as their digital assistant of choice, and they might be dismayed at its absence. Fortunately, Google Assistant is still ready at your beck and call, and it's no less helpful a companion. (And if you really value Alexa integration over Project Fi compatibility, you could always opt for the standard edition of the phone at no difference in price.)The Moto X4 is commendable for a midrange mobile phone, but it's also conflicted. In some ways, it feels like a full-priced flagship. The metal-and-glass craftsmanship is satisfying, if not seductive. The battery life exceeds what you get from many phones that cost twice as much. And the inclusion of water resistance and NFC places it a caliber above budget competitors.And yet despite all that, the X4 still can't compete with the benchmark of bargains, the OnePlus 5. For $80 more, OnePlus throws in a more vibrant display, a faster processor, sharper cameras and double the RAM. It’s simply an all around better phone that never leaves you wanting for more.Alternatively, you could spend $120 less for the G5S Plus. The G5S Plus matches the Moto X4 in nearly every dimension, save for IP68 protection and tap-and-pay support. For its price, it's a much more compelling value.The Moto X4, on the other hand, is neither here nor there. The Android One version certainly makes a case for itself as the first low-cost Project Fi phone — or at least low-cost compared to Google's Pixel devices. If you're interested in Google's service, there's nothing else like it on the market. But as supremely well-rounded as the Moto X4 is, you can still do better, particularly if you're not partial to a specific wireless carrier.Credit: Shuan Lucas/Tom's Guide"
206,Moto E4 Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-e4-plus,review-4724.html","Motorola’s E lineup targets people who want a dependable smartphone for a low price. While this year’s new edition, the Moto E4, had some appeal as a budget phone, I couldn’t get past its poor battery life.The Moto E4 Plus, another low-priced sibling to the E4, fixes that flaw in a big way. For less than $200, the Moto E4 Plus packs in the biggest battery around, lasting longer than just about every other smartphone on the market.The 5,000 mAh battery in the E4 Plus is the star of the show, so let’s start there. With a battery that size, we’d expect this Moto to clock in some serious overtime, and, boy, does it ever.The E4 Plus lands close to the top of our list of longest-lasting smartphones, powering through 14 hours and 48 minutes on the Tom’s Guide Battery Test of continuous web surfing over AT&T’s LTE network. That’s bananas: Only the ZenFone 3 Zoom has lasted longer on a charge, at 16:46. (And Asus’ phone costs $150 more than the E4 Plus.) The average smartphone conks out at 9:40, so the Moto E4 Plus gives you an extra 5 hours of battery life. For a phone at this price, there’s just no competition.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThe only problem is that Motorola chose to go micro USB for charging instead of the new standard, USB-C, which limits the chargers you can use with the device and doesn’t future-proof it for tech developments down the line.The Moto E4 Plus looks like every budget Moto device: thick black bezels, Moto logo at the top, fingerprint sensor on the bottom, Motorola logo emblazoned on the back and a circular black cutout for the rear camera lens. Motorola has established its design language, which is fine, even if it’s not particularly thrilling.Other budget phones, such as ZTE’s Blade Z Max and LG’s K20 Plus, cut costs by using plastic. The E4 Plus has a metal back that makes the phone feel more like a premium device, though it also adds some heft. The K20 Plus feels lightweight at less than 5 ounces, while the E4 Plus packs another ounce and a half in its large frame.I didn’t expect much out of the E4 Plus’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 427 processor, which scored a middling 1,891 on the GeekBench 4 test of overall system performance. But the device handled the graphics-intensive race car game Real Racing 3 with ease; there wasn’t even a hint of lag as I controlled the steering wheel by tilting the phone left and right. After 20 minutes of gameplay I threw the E4 Plus down in anger — not because of the phone’s performance, but because I placed 8th in a key race.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesThe Plus model’s performance is particularly impressive because that’s where the Moto E4 faltered. When I played games on that phone, which has a comparable GeekBench score (1,711) to its larger sibling, it ran hot — uncomfortably so. The E4 Plus doesn’t have that problem.The E4 Plus isn’t particularly fast when it comes to loading web pages in Chrome, but switching between tabs is quick enough, and running multiple apps at once doesn’t have a noticeable effect on the phone’s speed.Streaming YouTube videos, including Stranger Things clips and the Blade Runner: 2049 trailer, was a breeze.If you have an extra $100, you can snag the better-performing Moto G5 Plus, which is made of more luxe materials and blows away the E4 Plus when it comes to graphics, thanks to an extra 2GB of RAM. On the Jetstream 1.1 JavaScript test, the E4 Plus scored 18.9 compared with the G5 Plus score of 30.3, but the lower-end device trumped the comparably priced LG K20 Plus’ score of 17.9. The E4 Plus also scored higher than the K20 Plus when it comes to graphics performance at 6,646 versus 5,187 on the 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited test.The E4 Plus sports a 13-megapixel rear camera that takes some pretty good shots. I photographed some flowers at a nearby farmers market, and though I couldn’t really frame the shots because the sunlight was so bright, the resulting images weren’t terrible.The E4 Plus has a built-in professional mode if you want to take control over settings such as the ISO and white balance, but most people will probably rely on the phone’s auto mode. To that end, the E4 Plus does a serviceable job without any manual settings enabled. I zoomed in on a butterfly that landed on the ground a few feet from me, and the camera perfectly captured the contrast of orange wings against the stone ground without adding any fuzziness or pixelation.The phone’s 5-megapixel front-facing camera is better than the Moto E4’s, which packs in the same lens. Motorola seems to have improved its image-processing software — while the E4 added a strange splotchiness to my forehead that I swear isn’t there in real life, the E4 Plus captured my skin as it actually is (freckled, FYI, not splotchy).The E4 Plus’ 5.5-inch HD display covers 119 percent of the sRGB gamut, which is better than the G5 Plus, K20 Plus and many other phones at this price and higher. It also beat those devices in color accuracy with a Delta-E rating of 0.27. (Numbers closer to 0 are better).There’s little difference in these test results between the E4 Plus and the 5-inch E4, which is all right since the display was one the E4’s better features. The E4 showed off 125 percent of the sRGB color gamut while tallying a Delta-E score of 0.26.Using a light meter, we found the E4 Plus reaches a peak brightness of 408 nits, just below the smartphone average of 433 nits, but perfectly usable.The E4 Plus’ stats translate to the real world with videos and games that come in clear, bright and saturated with color. It’s not the greatest screen we’ve ever seen, but for an LCD panel, it’s pretty good.You can buy the Moto E4 Plus unlocked to use on any U.S. carrier. It comes in two storage options: 16GB for $179 and 32GB for $199.I tested another version, an Amazon Prime Exclusive edition of the Moto E4 Plus, which comes with home screen ads for products on Amazon’s site and literally every app Amazon makes — nine apps total. Some are fine, like Prime Video and Kindle, but others, such as Prime Photo and Amazon Music, are a waste of space. Don’t even get me started on those annoying ads, though they do bring the price of the phone down to $139 (a $40 discount).MORE: A Guide to No Contract and Prepaid Phone PlansIn an era when we’re storing more on our phones, 16GB of capacity just isn’t enough. My Amazon Prime version of the E4 Plus had less than 10GB of usable space after Amazon and Google’s apps had taken it over. The storage is expandable, thanks to a microSD slot, but manufacturers shouldn’t be eating up all the room you pay for.The Moto E4 Plus ships with Android 7.1. And you had better like Nougat, because this phone isn’t included on the list of Moto devices in line to get Oreo this year. That’s a trade-off you’ll have to accept in exchange for an inexpensive phone that goes forever on a charge.If you need a phone that rarely sleeps, the Moto E4 Plus’s incredible battery life is hard to pass up, especially for less than $200. The device’s display, camera and performance aren’t the best you can get, not even in a budget phone, but they’re good enough if a lower price tag is more important to you than cutting edge-features.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
207,Moto G5S Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-g5s-plus,review-4718.html","Motorola has taken its budget darling, the G5 Plus, and tweaked it just enough to deliver an even better package. There are three key areas in which the G5S Plus outperforms the cheaper G5 Plus: screen size, design and the presence of an all-new dual 13-megapixel camera setup.For those benefits, both configurations of the G5S Plus cost $50 more than equivalent versions of the G5 Plus, which cost $229 and $299. However, that doesn't tell the whole story, because at launch, Motorola has cut the cost of the G5S Plus by $50, meaning you can get the phone for what you'd pay for a G5 Plus. That pricing is for a limited time, though.The result is a slight improvement on our favorite sub-$300 handset, though perhaps not enough of an upgrade to justify the higher price tag.The G5S Plus starts at $279 for 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM, and $349 for 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Motorola calls this phone a special edition, and it's available unlocked and compatible with all four major U.S. carriers.Motorola typically plays it safe in the design department, especially with its lower-priced phones, with a general shape and aesthetic that run through its entire range. The G5S Plus doesn't do anything to buck that trend, but there's still a lot to like here.The differences in fit and finish versus the standard G5 Plus are actually quite striking when you sit both phones side by side. Whereas the earlier model employed a discreet mix of metal and plastic, the G5S Plus features a new unibody chassis with a slightly larger footprint that looks and feels much more premium.The proof is in the details. The diamond-cut edges make for a nice contrast against the aluminum body. Slightly slimmer bezels, particularly at the bottom, make the G5S Plus feel like a modern smartphone, and the subtly curved 2.5D glass adds another layer of polish you typically don't find in devices in this price range.If I have one gripe, it's that the oversized circular camera housing could use some trimming. It sticks out like a sore thumb, and breaks up the clean lines and smooth surface of the aluminum. I accidentally grazed it on several occasions while holding the phone, and each time, it felt awkward — like a fridge magnet randomly tacked onto the rear.The Moto G5 Plus already featured one of our favorite displays in a budget phone, so how does the G5S Plus' screen compare? For the most part, well. Both Moto phones employ 1080p screens, but the discrepancy comes down to size. The G5S Plus' LCD is slightly larger, at 5.5 inches, compared with the G5 Plus' 5.2-inch panel.Ratcheting up the size with the same number of pixels obviously causes a slight drop in sharpness, but the G5S Plus' display is so superb — particularly when it comes to color representation — that we didn't care. The trailer for Maze Runner: The Death Cure absolutely popped, with striking contrast and vibrant hues no matter the viewing angle.Color accuracy proved to be the G5S Plus' greatest strength. In our testing, this phone's screen registered a Delta-E rating of 0.29. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) That not only outperforms the G5 Plus' score of 0.94, but it's on a par with the Samsung Galaxy S8's 0.28. Few smartphones, at any price, come close.Color range performance was also strong. Showing off 109 percent of the sRGB color gamut, the G5S Plus scored in the same ballpark as its closest competitors — the similarly priced ZTE Blade V8 Pro (112 percent) and Huawei Honor 6X (114 percent). It's a far cry from the color range you get from a phone with an OLED panel, but it's on par with other phones in the G5S Plus' price range.In terms of brightness, the picture isn't quite so rosy for the G5S Plus. While Motorola's earlier G5 Plus delivered a very impressive 591 nits, its latest phone came in at just 400 nits. That's slightly below the 433-nit average for smartphones, as well as the scores from the ZTE Blade V8 Pro (430) and the Honor 6X (444 nits). It's a disappointing step back for an otherwise class-leading display.The G5S Plus is powered by Qualcomm's midrange Snapdragon 625 processor. That's the same chipset featured in the regular G5 Plus, and unsurprisingly, performance is equally snappy in the new model. No matter how many Chrome tabs we opened, or how much scrolling or app switching we did, it didn't slow down.We tested the Moto G5S Plus configuration with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. Those are flagship numbers for a budget handset, though you won't find them in the less-expensive variant of the G5S Plus, which features half the storage and a gigabyte less of RAM. The memory deficit in the less-expensive version means it likely won't handle multitasking quite as well as the model we tested.Measuring overall system performance with Geekbench 4, our G5S Plus delivered a score of 4,126 — better than the G5 Plus' 3,746. That phone was already among the fastest in the sub-$300 segment, so seeing the G5S Plus edge it out was a nice surprise.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesGraphics performance was pretty much more of the same. This handset produced a 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited score of 13,805. That situates the G5S Plus between the G5 Plus and the ZTE Blade V8 Pro, which scored 13,862 and 11,897, respectively.Both versions of the G5S Plus include a microSD slot to add an extra 128GB of storage. Sadly, U.S. devices miss out on NFC for Android Pay. Budget handsets typically lack NFC, but the G5S doesn't feel as low-end as its price suggests, and considering customers elsewhere in the world get it, the NFC omission is difficult to overlook.Similarly frustrating is the lack of 802.11ac Wi-Fi connectivity, which prevents the G5S Plus from reaching the highest data speeds over home and office wireless networks. This was a shortcoming of the original G5 Plus that really should have been fixed with the special edition, yet was left unaddressed.For years, dual cameras were a luxury fit only for the most expensive, cutting-edge handsets. With the G5S Plus, Motorola has brought the tech to one of its more modest devices for the very first time. Unfortunately, after spending some time with the phone's dual rear cameras, we're not so sure it was worth the trouble.The G5S Plus carries two 13-MP sensors on the back, as well as an 8-MP one for selfies — all of which feature an f/2.0 aperture. As on the Moto Z2 Force, one of the rear cameras shoots in monochrome, and is designed to capture only light and detail without color. Yet unlike with the Z2 Force, you can't use that lens exclusively for black-and-white photography, which is a bit of a letdown.Still, that second lens allows the G5S Plus to pull off depth tricks, like bokeh, which adds an artistic blur to the background of your photos. When used in normal mode, however, the results are surprisingly underwhelming.Comparing the same skyline shot between the G5S Plus and another budget 13-MP dual-camera offering, ZTE's Blade V8 Pro, we see Motorola's auto white balance has opted for a greener tint. There's less contrast overall, which helps retain some fidelity that's lacking in the ZTE's darker exposure. But if you zoom in dead center, you can't actually discern the bricks on the buildings as easily with the G5S Plus. Everything kind of gets muddied together, with no sharpness.In low light, however, the G5S Plus' more balanced contrast helped it achieve a more detailed shot in comparison to the one from the Blade V8 Pro. The Motorola picked up intricacies in the texture of my hand and the wall that the ZTE missed.The Motorola phone wins some more points with its superior depth effect mode, which lets you adjust the focus and strength of the blur before and after shooting. It's a feature that feels magical the first time you use it, and compared to the Blade V8 Pro, the result looks more like what you'd find on a genuine full-size camera and less like a simulation achieved through software.Shooting in this mode, though, you encounter a critical issue: The images simply take too long to capture on the Moto G5 Plus. You'll have to wait up to 6 seconds for the phone to process and save some images with bokeh enabled. And when it's complete, you're still left with an image that lacks clarity where you want it.The regular G5 Plus may only have a single camera, but it sports a superior f/1.7 aperture and speedier dual-pixel autofocus. When the novelty of the dual cameras wears off and the frustration sets in, we know which we'd rather have.Up front, the G5S Plus utilizes an 8-MP sensor, improving on the 5-MP sensor in the G5 Plus. A front-facing flash sits alongside the wide-angle lens, and the overall results from this camera are bright and balanced. However, they exhibit a slight lack of clarity compared to the images from the Blade V8 Pro, which is most evident in my hair and the pattern of my shirt.This phone will last you all day.. The G5S Plus' 3,000-mAh battery topped out at 11 hours and 50 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test, which consists of continuous web surfing over T-Mobile LTE. That's more than 2 hours past the 9:40 smartphone average. The just-released iPhone 8 Plus, a device that costs more than three times as much, even comes up short by about a half-hour.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeIf you're wondering how it stacks up on a more level playing field, the G5S Plus delivered nearly 10 more minutes of use than the G5 Plus, which has the same size battery. The aforementioned Blade V8 Pro defeated both, at 12:08.Like most Motorola phones, the G5S Plus comes packaged with a TurboPower fast charger. In this instance, the adapter provides 6 hours of juice in 15 minutes when connected to the wall.Android phone makers don't always understand the value of restraint when it comes to software, but fortunately, Motorola does. The G5S Plus launches with Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and aside from a slightly modified launcher and a helpful suite of optional gestures housed in the Moto app, this is stock Android in all its elegant, simple glory.With Moto Actions, you can eliminate the on-screen navigation bar for an even roomier display, and use the G5S Plus' front-mounted fingerprint sensor as a full replacement. There's a shortcut to access the phone's flashlight with a chopping motion, and another that immediately opens the camera app when you twist the phone.In addition to gestures, the Moto app includes Moto Display, an interface that discreetly and briefly presents notifications when the phone is locked. There's more to be found in the Moto app, and we strongly recommend trying out everything it has to offer.MORE: Android Tips to Unlock Your Phone's Full PotentialTo sweeten the experience, Motorola has also announced it will bring Android 8.0 Oreo to the entire G5 range in the coming months. However, owners shouldn't expect an update to Android P in 2018, as the company typically holds its budget products to just one year of software support.In nearly every respect, Motorola's latest phone equals or improves on the already compelling G5 Plus. And yet, the answer to the question ""Should you buy one?"" still cannot be answered with a simple yes or no.If you're looking to take the plunge while Motorola is selling the G5S Plus for the same price as the standard model, you should go for it. You'll appreciate the more meticulous design and more pleasant user experience compared to rivals like the $200 Honor 6X and $230 Blade V8 Pro.Once Motorola retires that promotion, it'll be a harder call to make. At $279 for the base 32GB/3GB model, the G5S Plus can't justify a purchase on the merits of its dual cameras alone. A slight edge in performance isn't going to account for that price difference, either. And if you're considering going the Amazon Prime route to nab an ad-supported G5 Plus for $185, the gulf in pricing is even wider.As great as the G5S Plus is, the first G5 Plus was already among the best bargains in the business. Although the special edition is mostly better, it's not as good a value — meaning the original remains the best bargain option for Android users.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
208,LG K20 Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-k20-plus,review-4714.html","Budget Android phones are a dime a dozen, but some stand out from the pack. LG’s K20 Plus is not one of those standouts.The $169 T-Mobile- and MetroPCS-exclusive device has a solid camera and colorful display, but falls short in a few key areas, notably performance.There’s nothing particularly special about the K20 Plus’ looks. The 5.3-inch HD display is surrounded by black bezels, which are extremely thick on the top and chin, despite no home button or fingerprint sensor on the bottom. (The fingerprint sensor and power button are one and the same, located on the back of the device.) Instead, LG slapped a giant logo there. There’s a logo on the slightly textured plastic back, too, so you’ll never forget you’re using an LG device.One design detail I like about the K20 Plus is its stylish copper trim, which edges the sides and bottom of the phone and outlines the rear camera lens. And the phone is incredibly lightweight at less than 5 ounces.Otherwise, the K20 Plus looks like a smartphone — and about as plain Jane as phone design gets.On paper, the K20 Plus’ 5.3-inch HD (1280 x 720) display has an unimpressive set of specs. It’s not as sharp, bright or colorful as rival budget phones such as ZTE’s Blade Z Max and Moto G5 Plus.That color was clear when I watched Cardi B’s “Bodak Yellow” music video and the new trailer for Netflix’s latest Marvel series, The Punisher. I was expecting muddiness, but the K20 Plus allows colors to shine.The K20 Plus’ screen reached a total brightness of 294 nits, well below the smartphone average of 433 nits. The screen is visible outdoors in bright sunlight if you need to respond to texts or emails, but photos and videos appear dim. The K20 Plus display covers only 75.1 percent of the sRGB spectrum; to put that in context, the Moto G5 Plus covers 106 percent.But the K20 Plus notched a Delta-E rating of 0.29 for color accuracy, which is extremely good for a phone at this price. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.) The G5 Plus scored a 0.94 and the Blade Z Max comes in at 0.70.The K20 Plus isn’t the most powerful phone you can buy for around $170. Far from it. The phone’s Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 scored a measly 1,682 in the GeekBench 4 test of overall system performance.Even the Moto E4 — no one’s idea of a speed demon — scored higher than the K20 Plus with 1,711 on GeekBench’s test. If you’re looking for a faster phone, the $299 version of the Moto G5 Plus sports a Snapdragon 625 CPU with 4GB of RAM that clocks in at 3,746 on GeekBench. (The Moto G5 Plus is also available for $229 unlocked — closer to the K20 Plus’ price — if you don’t need all that RAM.) Moto’s G5 Plus is also getting the latest version of Android, Oreo, which is something few other budget phones can claim.MORE: Best Cheap Unlocked SmartphonesSometimes performance scores don’t translate into actual user experience — some phones score lower than others but aren’t noticeably slower. The K20 Plus feels slow. When I streamed YouTube videos, the colors were gorgeous, but it took at least 20 to 30 seconds for the video to stop buffering and come in clear.If you want to spend less than $100, ZTE’s Blade Z Max isn’t the best-performing phone with a Geekbench score of 2,595, but its Snapdragon 625 CPU is much faster than the K20 Plus, and it has a solid dual-lens camera with neat bokeh effects and a great 6-inch display.The K20 Plus features a 13-megapixel rear camera and 5-MP front-facing lens, both of which are perfectly capable of capturing clear, bright images. The rear camera is particularly solid, though there’s a lag between pressing the shutter and the image capture. There are no special features, or even manual controls, but for capturing basic shots, the K20 Plus is perfectly fine.I captured the Manhattan skyline from my office building’s rooftop in glaring midday sunlight, and while it’s not the best photograph that’s ever been taken, the buildings and clouds are detailed and the sky is perfectly blue.There is an option to add film-inspired filters to your photos, but there’s no reason to do this on the device when you’re just gonna upload these images to Instagram.The front-facing camera is no good, unless you like your phone to soften your selfies (or “beautify” them) for you. This effect smooths out your skin, removing lines and other so-called imperfections. It’s like Photoshop for your face, which seems kind of cool at first, but it looks completely unnatural.My skin lost its skin-like texture and seemed as if I applied a heavy-handed blur tool. I happen to like my freckles, so this feature isn’t ideal. A slider overlaid on the camera preview lets you choose how soft you want your skin to look, but you can’t turn it off completely. Even at its lowest setting, the filter made my skin look almost grainy, which is bizarre, and made me never want to use the K20 Plus’s front-facing camera ever, ever again.LG packed a 2,700 mAh removable battery in this device. Removable batteries are becoming increasingly rare in the Android world, but they’re incredibly useful you want to keep your smartphone chugging as long as possible since you can swap in a new battery whenever you want.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThe battery itself clocked in at 9 hours and 43 minutes on the Tom’s Guide Battery Test, continuous websurfing over LTE on T-Mobile’s network. The average smartphone lasts 9:40, so the K20 Plus result is solid, particularly for such an inexpensive device.LG made the K20 Plus exclusive to T-Mobile and its prepaid subsidiary, MetroPCS. If you don’t use either wireless carrier and don’t plan to, the K20 Plus is a no-go.MORE: T-Mobile vs. MetroPCSBut if you are thinking of switching, MetroPCS is offering the K20 Plus at the discounted rate of $99 (down from $169). MetroPCS uses T-Mobile’s network, which is one of the fastest in the country. We also rank MetroPCS as the top discount carrier, though it fared poorly in our customer-service testing.LG’s K20 Plus is a fine phone, but it’s not future-proofed — it has a microUSB port for charging instead of the more common USB-C, and there’s no indication the phone, currently running Nougat, will be upgradable to Android Oreo anytime soon.You can get a faster, more powerful device with better display and a dual-lens camera such as the Blade Z Max for slightly less money than the K20 Plus, which is mainly appealing if you can get the phone for a discount, like MetroPCS’s $99 offer.Display: 5.3-inch 1280x720 LCD OS: Android 7 CPU: Snapdragon 425 RAM: 2GB RAM Storage: 32GB (expandable up to 2TB) Cameras (Rear/Front): 13-MP / 5-MP Size and Weight: 5.85 x 2.96 x 0.31 inches, 4.94 ounces Battery Life: 9:43"
209,Alcatel A30 Plus,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/alcatel-a30-plus,review-4703.html","Five years ago, the prospect of snagging an unlocked smartphone for less than $100 was almost unthinkable. But technology has come a long way, and it's led us to Alcatel's latest bargain, the A30 Plus. The first thing you'll notice about this Android phone is its price — just $80, if you buy it through Amazon’s ad-supported Prime Exclusives program. The standard unlocked version of the A30 Plus costs $130.Truthfully, that price tag is the only thing you'll notice. The A30 Plus is about as budget as budget gets. If you're looking to spend as little as possible and don't need a particularly fast or flashy smartphone, this device will get the job done. Still, other options offer better value.The A30 Plus is clad in plastic all over, and there's no mistaking it for anything more premium. In this phone, Alcatel has somewhat tried to emulate the look of the company's higher-end Idol 5S, but with cheaper materials. Silver plastic has replaced the 5S's aluminum band, and the glass back has been scrubbed in favor of a textured, removable cover. At 5.57 ounces and about 0.33 inches thick, the A30 Plus isn't as slim or light as the Idol 5S, either.Overall, the A30 Plus doesn't look great. The housings for the earpiece and microphone are strangely finished in different colors, while the back feels tacky. A soft-touch surface might have been less visually distinctive but would have made the phone a little more pleasing to hold.On the front of the A30 Plus, you'll find a roomy, 5.5-inch display with unsurprisingly chunky bezels. Disappointingly, a fingerprint sensor is nowhere to be found. While budget phones historically have lacked that feature, lately it's appeared in more devices below the $200 mark, like the Moto E4 and ZTE Blade Z Max.As its name suggests, the A30 Plus is the larger sibling of Alcatel's $99 A30, and one of the main differences between those two devices is screen size. Whereas the A30 features a 5-inch, 720p LCD display, the A30 Plus' panel is larger, at 5.5 inches. The low resolution is common among handsets this cheap, but you really begin to notice it on the Plus' larger screen.The colors in the latest trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi definitely lacked some punch on the A30 Plus' display. If you prefer vibrant, over-saturated hues, you'll be disappointed by the Alcatel's more muted palette.Color reproduction was respectable, though easily outclassed by one of the A30's primary competitors, the Moto E4. Alcatel's offering reproduced 110 percent of the sRGB color gamut (higher is better) and registered a Delta-E score of 1.03 (closer to zero is better). That's not too shabby for an LCD panel in a budget device, but it falls short of the Moto E4's results of 125 percent and 0.26, respectively.MORE: 8 Cheap Android Smartphones (Under $200) RankedBrightness tells a similar story. The A30 averaged 371 nits in our testing. That's a little better better than the Blu R1 Plus' 364 nits, but again far short of the Moto E4 and its 503 nits.Nowhere is the A30 Plus' budget status more apparent than in its overall performance. This phone is powered by MediaTek's MTK6738 processor — which falls in the same category as Qualcomm's Snapdragon 425 — along with 2GB of RAM, and it's not particularly hard to push this device to its limit.Some cheap phones, like the aforementioned Moto E4, have squeezed a smooth user experience out of similarly modest hardware. So we were a bit surprised to find scrolling lag in Chrome on our A30 Plus, as well as a 4- to 5-second wait when opening some apps.On Geekbench 4, which measures overall performance, the A30 turned in a multicore result of 1,707, — just shy of the Moto E4's 1,711. Graphics testing was more illustrative: The A30 Plus scored a 6,599 on 3D Mark's Ice Storm Unlimited benchmark. That was enough to outperform the similarly specced Blu R1 Plus, which managed a score of 3,723.In actual use, however, the A30 Plus isn't much of a graphics powerhouse. Specifically, graphic-intensive games are out of the question, as the A30 Plus couldn't muster a playable frame rate on CSR Racing 2. Thankfully, less visually demanding titles, like Super Mario Run, were much more manageable.For storage, the A30 Plus packs 16GB of internal memory — about 10GB of which was free when we booted up the phone for the first time. You'll likely need extra space, so fortunately there's a microSD slot on board, which provides up to an additional 32GB.Around the back of the A30 Plus, you'll find a 13-megapixel shooter that, like many budget-phone cameras, performs adequately only in ideal scenarios. Non-HDR captures are quick, and there's no viewfinder lag when lighting is plentiful. But low-light photo opps grind the experience to a halt, turning the result into a hazy, noisy mess.You need to manually activate HDR, though this only made our shots worse on a cloudy afternoon in New York. Flipping HDR on returned some detail in the sky, which had been blown out in pure white.However, that came at the cost of washing out every building in the frame, turning the city into a bleak, grungy, almost apocalyptic scene. To make matters worse, HDR exposures take far too look to capture and process, a problem for people with shaky hands.There's little more to say about the 5-MP, front-facing camera, though it does come with its own flash, which is a nice bonus.On paper, the A30 Plus has a decently sized battery, rated at 3,000 mAh. Because this battery is paired with one of MediaTek's more efficient chipsets, we didn't expect the A30 Plus to lack longevity. Unfortunately, the results in our battery test didn't live up to that hope; Alcatel's handset lasted for just 6 hours and 41 minutes of continuous web surfing on Verizon's LTE network.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThat's well below the smartphone average of 9:40. The budget-priced Blu R1 Plus lasted 10:36 with similar hardware and a bigger battery. Meanwhile, the Moto E4 was right on par with the A30 Plus, topping out at 6:42.The A30 Plus runs Android 7.0 Nougat, which is no longer the latest version of Google's OS now that Android Oreo is out. While more-expensive devices should receive updates, Alcatel doesn't have the best track record when of keeping its devices on the current firmware — especially toward the lower end of the market. TCL, Alcatel's parent company, couldn't confirm that the phone would be updated to Oreo when we asked.With that in mind, it's encouraging to know Alcatel has limited customizations to stock Android with the A30 Plus. You'll find a different launcher than what you'd typically get from a Google-branded device, as well as a suite of the manufacturer's own apps. Otherwise, there's no bloatware to speak of.If you spring for the Amazon Prime Exclusive variant, you'll be served ads on your lock screen and some additional preloaded apps in exchange for a $50 savings off the $130 price of the unlocked phone.  The A30 Plus can be purchased in two flavors: unlocked, for $130, or in Amazon Prime Exclusive configuration, for $80. The cheaper option is a deal available only to Prime members, though Amazon will give you a $50 gift card if you're not already subscribed and you sign up for the service at checkout. Whichever model you get, both are sold only through Amazon, and will work on either GSM or CDMA cellular networks.The A30 Plus isn't offensively flawed in any way, but when the competition is pushing more value across the board, it becomes much harder to recommend this phone. For the same price as the unlocked A30 Plus, you can have the Moto E4, which we prefer for its fingerprint sensor, more vibrant display, better software experience and tasteful design.Spend $160, and there's the Blu R1 Plus and its much longer-lasting battery. If longevity is your priority, we'd also recommend Moto's $180 E4 Plus. With a massive, 5,000-mAh battery packed in, the E4 Plus can easily deliver two to three days' worth of use on a single charge. If your budget is flexible, all of those devices are worth the added expense.If lock-screen ads don't bother you, there's certainly an argument to be made for the Amazon-branded variant of the A30 Plus, provided you're willing to live with the trade-offs that other budget phones don't ask you to make.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's Guide"
210,iOS 11,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/ios-11,review-4681.html","Let's drop all pretense here: If you've got an iPhone capable of running Apple's newly released iOS 11, you're going to update sooner or later. And when you do install iOS 11 on your mobile device, you're going to like what you see.Unlike the fragmented Android World, where a third of devices are running the two-year-old Marshmallow version and the newer Android Oreo will trickle out to phones in drips and drabs, Apple's iOS updates usually find their way to iPhones and iPads in short order. Largely, that's because Apple makes it so easy to upgrade; just go into the Software Update section of your Settings and download the available update. But it's also because Apple usually makes some compelling enhancements in its annual iOS updates, and iOS 11 is no exception.iOS 11 dramatically improves existing apps like Maps and makes some welcome changes to Messages and Siri. It's easier to control iOS 11 than the previous OS, and Apple even introduced some measure of customization in the form of an improved Control Center. The most exciting feature is augmented reality, offering a new breed of games, education and entertainment apps that deliver an immersive 360-degree experience. Upgrading to iOS 11 is a largely seamless experience that will enhance how you use your phone.Yes. But when should you get iOS 11? If, like me, you've been running the public beta since it came out this June, updating to the full release is a no brainer, especially since it introduces features that weren't fully baked during the beta stage. For iPhone owners who've held out for the full version of iOS 11, though, there's the question of updating now or waiting for the inevitable maintenance updates to quash any lingering bugs.Early versions of the iOS 11 beta had their rough patches, triggering several restarts for my iPhone SE during the summer. Things stabilized as Apple rolled out additional updates; I counted nine updates to the beta in total. I still see an occasional bug — the Now Playing portion of the lock screen is occasionally AWOL when I wake up my iPhone by lifting it — but nothing I would consider a showstopper.More: iPhone 8 and 8 Plus Review: Record-Breaking Speed, Samsung-Beating CamerasThe bigger concern is battery life, as new OSes have been known to affect how long your iPhone can last on a charge, at least until Apple can tweak things with subsequent software updates. Anecdotally, since installing iOS 11, I've noticed that I need to plug in my iPhone SE at some point during the day if I want to make it to bedtime with any charge remaining, though the battery drain was more severe with initial versions of the public beta.If you've waited this long to install, it wouldn't hurt to wait until the first minor update to iOS 11 tackles any lingering performance issues. But if you want to dive right in right now, this is a perfectly stable update that introduces some welcome enhancements. Apple release the update today (Sept. 19), and it's ready for you to install on your iPhone.Just make sure you have a device capable of running iOS 11. For the iPhone, that means an iPhone 5s or later; iPad owners will need at least an iPad mini 2, a fifth-generation iPad, or any iPad Pro or iPad Air.You'll also want to make sure that your favorite apps will run on iOS 11, which supports only 64-bit apps. If you rely on an app that's been updated at any point in the last year or so, it's likely to work in iOS 11.You can find out if there are any 32-bit apps lingering on your phone by going to Settings, tapping About and selecting Applications. There, you'll see a list of all the apps installed on your iPhone that won't run in iOS 11. If any one of those apps is part of your daily routine, you'll want to hold off on updating, at least until you can find a good alternative.When you are ready to upgrade, get set for a few notable changes and several seamless enhancements to the iOS experience. For me, the most noteworthy addition has been a redesigned Control Center that Apple even lets you customize.You can access the Control Center from any screen (even the lock screen) just by swiping up. The Control Center's new look features tappable panels that let you handle everything from turning Airplane Mode on to adjusting screen brightness to accessing the flashlight. If you've got a 3D Touch-capable phone, some controls respond to firmer presses, such as the camera icon, which offers shortcuts to selfies and slo-mo video modes.Even better, Apple gives you some say over which items appear in the Control Center. In addition to the 11 modules that appear by default, you can have a list of more than a dozen other controls at your disposal. I'm particularly fond of the Low-Power Mode shortcut that lets you quickly turn on this battery-saving feature from the Control Center. Rearranging the order that these controls appear in is as simple as going into Settings and dragging things around.MORE: Customize iOS 11's Control CenterIt sounds like a modest change, but there's not a day that goes by that I don't access the Control Center. I get up much earlier than my wife, and I find the built-in flashlight to be a helpful aid in navigating my way through a darkened bedroom without waking up my wife. It's very convenient just to swipe up on my iPhone screen and turn that flashlight on with a tap, instead of digging through Settings.iOS 11 introduces one control change I don't like, forcing you to go through Control Center to manage screen mirroring. I watch Portland Thorns soccer games through Verizon's go90 app, and I like to stream that content to a bigger screen through my Apple TV. Prior to iOS 11, I could handle this entirely through the go90 app, but now I have to summon the Control Center to turn screen mirroring on when I want to start watching the game and off when I'm done. One time, I forgot to turn off mirroring, and my family was treated to selections from my playlist booming out of the Apple TV when I started using the music app. It's a bit of a hassle that I hope Apple corrects.iOS 11's biggest new arrival relies on third-party app makers, but if they deliver, this change figures to be a huge one. Along with iOS 11, Apple released ARKit, a set of software-development tools designed to help app makers add augmented reality features. While Apple's latest iPhones are built with AR capabilities in mind, even older devices will reap some of ARKit's benefits. All you need is a phone with an A9 processor that's running iOS 11, and my iPhone SE fits the bill.We're still waiting on ARKit-built apps to hit the App Store, but early access to some apps provided by Apple gives us a taste of what to expect. Ikea built an app that lets you see how the company's furniture will fit into your home; the superimposed furniture looks a little cartoony, but it's a practical example of what AR apps can do.A Thomas & Friends Minis app creates virtual play sets, which I figure will help keep my daughter amused with AR-fueled train tracks she can assemble. And the next time I'm at an Oakland A's game, I'm looking forward to whipping out the AR-enhanced MLB At Bat app that Apple previewed at its iPhone X launch event so that I can see superimposed stats appear on the field of play.MORE: 12 iPhone X Features We Can't Wait to UseAnother app we tried is The Machines, a real-time strategy game with mechs and pretty sophisticated graphics. It was fairly easy to place turrets around our virtual board, and it was impressive to hear the sounds of explosions grow louder as we got closer to the action with an iPhone 8.The augmented reality features built into iOS 11 will shine only if developers take advantage of them. But given app makers' fondness for building iOS apps and the ubiquity of iPhones, I see that happening sooner with iOS 11 than with Google's ARCore.iOS 11 introduces one new built-in app. Files aims to let you organize files whether they're stored on your device or in the cloud, giving you quick access to whatever document you happen to be working on. I like that Files works with third-party apps, but to be honest, I found myself going straight to the Dropbox app to access files rather than turning to Apple's built-in solution.MORE: Here Are the New iPhone CamerasThe app is really part of iOS 11's iPad-centric enhancements — more on those in a bit — and while it's nice to have that included on the iPhone, I really don't see Files becoming an essential part of my workflow. In fact, since Apple started letting you remove built-in apps as of the iOS 10 update, I can easily see myself dispatching Files off to the cornfield.Apple promises improvements to its Siri assistant with each iOS update, and iOS 11 delivers those, to a point. Siri sounds a lot more natural in this incarnation, and while that may not seem like a big change, it does make conversing with the digital assistant feel a lot less awkward.More helpful is that Siri's a better listener. I use the voice commands to set timers when I'm cooking and my hands are otherwise occupied. In older versions of iOS, there would be a noticeable gap between when I said, ""Hey, Siri,"" and when Apple's assistant acknowledged my voice, the end results being that Siri would hear only the last few words of my request, not know what to do and receive a torrent of foul language from me as a result. Now, Siri starts listening almost instantaneously after I say, ""Hey, Siri,"" and at last I can cook waffles without incident.MORE: How to Use iPhone X Without A Home ButtonApple made other changes to Siri, like adding the ability to translate from five languages (Chinese, Spanish, French, German and Italian), which came in handy for me on a recent trip to Germany, where I was able to order in a restaurant without causing any international incidents. Siri also now proactively offers search suggestions in Safari based on the context of what you're reading, and this figures to become more useful as Siri learns your reading habits. Right now, it's still pretty helpful, though, as a news article on the Green Bay Packers will summon up search suggestions on Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Apple says that Siri's knowledge base has expanded, mainly in the form of more Wikipedia-fueled answers. That may be, but when I have a question that needs answering, I still find myself firing up the iOS version of Google Assistant, which has the advantage of drawing upon Google's more extensive knowledge base. Siri's good for iPhone-specific tasks and can even interact with some third-party apps, but Google's assistant is still the smarter cookie.Among existing apps, Maps sees the most helpful improvements. A new lane-assist feature in driving directions tells you which lane you should be in for merges and turns, and it's helped me navigate Bay Area freeways with a minimum of agitation.A setting connected to Maps also extends iOS 11's Do Not Disturb feature to driving, and since turning it on, I've not been bothered by phone calls or texts when I've been behind the wheel. Parents, in particular, will appreciate that addition.Indoor maps of shopping malls and airports figure to be helpful, particularly if you want to know what restaurant options are within sprinting distance of your departure gate. I particularly like that Apple includes maps for different floors when you're inside a multistory building. The challenge is that Apple is gradually rolling out support, and you might not think to check Maps to see if the indoor mapping feature is available for a particular building. I wish Apple would do more to help you discover this feature, like when it sends you a notification that public-transit information is available in Maps once you arrive in a new city.I've never really gotten into Apple's Live Photos feature, which tacks on a few seconds of audio and motion to still photos captured by your iPhone. Apple tries to make the feature more attractive in iOS 11 by letting you trim Live Photos and select a new key photo.A more significant change is the addition of three new Live Photo effects: Loop, Bounce and Long Exposure. You may get a kick out of how Bounce makes the action go back and forth, and photo buffs may appreciate the DSLR-esque effect that Long Exposure adds to action sequences.The real-time previews of these effects are certainly helpful, but the quality of Live Photos still hinges heavily on your skill as a photographer.I wasn't able to test out a major change to Apple Pay, which will let you send money to family and friends. I'm eager to try out this new iOS 11 capability, as the fine print doesn't sound as convenient as has been touted. For starters, any money you receive is put in a virtual Apple Pay Cash card found in the Wallet app. You'll be able to transfer that money to a bank account — it's unclear how easy that process will be — but Apple clearly would prefer you keep that money on your Apple Pay Cash card to use in transactions of your own.MORE: Best Apple LaptopsWhen you send payments, you can do so without incurring any charge using either Apple Pay Cash or a debit card; there is a fee for credit card users, though. Obviously, those are features we need to explore in greater depth, once they go live.Your phone isn't a laptop replacement and likely never will be. But more of us use our phones to tackle a lot more tasks, and Apple seems to recognize that fact with some of the productivity enhancements it's made with iOS 11.You can now mark up screenshots you take with your iPhone. Just tap the screenshot thumbnail that appears in the lower left corner of your phone after you've captured the screenshot, and a share sheet lets you save Safari pages as PDFs, which you can then mark up to your heart's content.For those times when you've got only one hand free to operate your phone, Apple added a one-handed keyboard mode that moves the keys on the on-screen keyboard closer to your thumb for quick typing.I spend a lot of time trying to track down emails, so I see a lot of potential in Mail's new Top Hits suggestions for searching. Type in a search term, and Top Hits of messages you've read recently or frequently jump to the top of search results. It's not perfected yet — a search for ""Cal tickets"" turned up a message from 2016 that's still in my in-box rather than the one from two weeks ago that I wanted to find — but Apple promises that Top Hits will get more accurate the more you use it.If you're holding on to an iPhone with just 16GB of onboard storage, you'll like the storage-optimization features in iOS 11 that maximize storage space by off-loading unused apps (your documents and data will be saved) or finding large attachments that are taking up room on your phone. Upgrading to a new phone should be easier, too, as iOS 11's Automatic Setup feature lets you pair your old iPhone to a new one to move over personal content and settings.iOS 11 overhauls the look of the App Store, and it's a welcome change. The new version includes a Today section that offers app-of-the-day recommendations and tips for making the most of the apps you use. A separate tab does the same for games, and you're still able to search for specific apps or update the ones installed on your device. The App Store app could be a place where you actually spend time, thanks to the changes introduced in iOS 11.MORE: 10 Reasons iPhone X Beats the Galaxy Note 8And it had better be, thanks to some less-welcome changes introduced in iTunes 12.7. That update closes up the App Store, meaning if you want to get an iPhone app, you had best do it on the phone itself.I'm particularly disappointed that iTunes no longer lets you rearrange how your apps appear on the phone; instead, you have to do that by dragging icons around on the iPhone's display. I find this method to be imprecise, especially when dragging apps from one screen to another. The redesigned App Store may make apps easier to find on your phone, but I hope Apple considers adding another way to manage your apps, too.On the iPhone, iOS 11 introduces largely welcome if not particularly Earth-shattering changes. That's not the case for iPad users, who will enter a whole new world with iOS 11.More: 24 Free Apps for New iPad UsersAmong the changes you can expect for your iPad are a redesigned Dock that looks more like what you'd expect from a macOS machine. iOS 11 also introduces drag-and-drop capabilities, which figures to be a big productivity booster. Multitasking features have been enhanced with Work Spaces, which lets you group apps together. And even that Files app I shrugged about on the iPhone should come in more handy as a filer browser for people who do a lot of work on their tablets.We tackle the iOS 11 changes for the iPad in greater depth over at sister site Laptop Mag.It's been a no brainer to update to previous iOS overhauls, and iOS 11 continues that fine tradition. The new version of Apple's mobile OS adds valuable capabilities without changing features so much that you'll have to relearn how to do things. Enhancements in iOS 11 generally will make your life easier, as a good OS update should.I have some reservations about Apple Pay's new payment capabilities, which I hope I can resolve by testing the feature. And some of the changes to News, Music and Files, I'll likely just ignore. But the souped-up Control Center, vastly improved Maps, and minor productivity boosters make iOS 11 a welcome addition to my iPhone. The augmented reality apps show a lot of potential, but developers are really just getting started."
211,Moto Z2 Play,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/moto-z2-play,review-4492.html","LG may have abandoned its family of mods for the G6, and Google's Project Ara got shut down before even even reaching the public. But Motorola remains committed to modular phones, which let you swap in add-ons that deliver new features to a handset. The Z2 Play is Motorola’s latest modular entry, offering a slightly more refined take on the company's midrange handset while also bringing a handful of new mods in tow.Priced at $408 on Verizon (or $499 unlocked when it goes on sale directly from Motorola later this summer), the Moro Z2 Play packs an even thinner body and a big, 5.5-inch AMOLED display while borrowing the nifty home button/fingerprint sensor with gesture controls from its budget sibling, the $229 Moto G5 Plus. However, the Z2 Play has lost the most important thing that set its predecessor apart from the pack: epic battery life.Measuring just 0.23-inches thick, the Z2 Play is one of the thinnest phones we've ever reviewed. In fact, it's almost 20 percent thinner than last year's 6.08 x 3 x 0.28-inch Z Play, which definitely isn't what you'd call a big-boned device. When checking out the Z2 Play's perfectly flat aluminum back and its giant rear camera module that juts out from the rest of the device, you get a design that seems to defy our current levels of tech.Below the screen there's a clever fingerprint sensor/home button combo that Moto borrowed from the G5 Plus. Unlike last year’s Moto Z and Moto Z Force flagships, the Z2 Play features both USB-C and dedicated headphone ports.One of the biggest improvements the Z2 Play offers over the G5 Plus is its super-AMOLED display. At 5.5-inch inches, not only is the Z2’s display significantly larger than the 5.2-inch screen on the G5 Plus, it's also way more colorful. When I made the mistake of watching the trailer for the Jumanji reboot, the way the Z2 Play recreated the lush greens of the jungle and the orange gouts of flame kept me watching longer than I otherwise would have.Our benchmark numbers back up my impressions, as the Moto Z2 Play’s panel produced 208 percent of the color gamut, which is higher than the smartphone average but behind the OnePlus 5’s 220 percent. The colors are accurate, too; the Z2 Play’s screen scored 0.91 on the Delta-E test (0 is perfect). The average phone scores 4.1, and the OnePlus 5 scored 1.65.With a peak brightness of 400 nits, the Z2 Play is just shy of the 439-nit smartphone average, but still brighter than the slightly more expensive OnePlus 5 (384 nits). However, with a panel that offers a luminous 591 nits, the Moto G5 Plus is almost 50 percent brighter than the Z2 Play.Featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 processor, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage and a microSD expandability, the Z2 Play can easily handle all your typical smartphone needs. However, overall performance isn't much better than what you get on the budget Moto G5 Plus, which features a Snapdragon 625 CPU.On the Jetstream 1.1 JavaScript test, the Z2 Play scored 33.74 versus 30.5 for the G5 Plus. To better put that in perspective, the Snapdragon 835-powered OnePlus 5, which costs $70 more than the Z2 Play, was more than twice as fast with a score of 70.19.The Z2 Play's graphics performance isn't anything to write home about, either. On 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test, the Z2 Play scored 13,977, barely higher than the G5 Plus' 13,862 and a good deal lower than the smartphone average of 19,302. The OnePlus 5 performed almost three times better on that test, at 39,576.With a 5-megapixel camera in front and a 16-MP shooter in back, the Z2 Play has the same specs on paper as the G5 Plus. The pictures you get from either phone look pretty similar, too.In a shot of some freshly baked bread, a picture from the Z2 Play looks almost exactly the same as one from the G5 Plus. There's a tiny difference in white balance, which gives the Z2 Play's photo a more neutral, less yellow hue, but it's extremely close.Results were similar in low light when I tried to take a shot of the new Moto mods with both phones. In fact, you might argue that the G5 Plus' picture is slightly better, because even though the G5 Plus shot looks a bit yellow again, it's slightly sharper and a tiny bit less grainy.I decided to make things a little more difficult for the Z2 Play by comparing its pictures to ones shot by the OnePlus 5 and that phone’s dual-rear cameras.At a bar, the Z2 Play's pic failed to match up against the OnePlus 5's shot, as it produced a less detailed image with weaker dynamic range from light to dark and softer focus on the brightly lit bottles.When I stepped outside to take a picture of some flowers, the Z2 Play's lack of focus and less saturated colors put it at a disadvantage against the OnePlus 5's much more vibrant photo.Even when I tried to take a selfie, the OnePlus 5 edged out the Z2 Play, thanks to better sharpness and white balance, and a more well-exposed shot.Moto Mods couldn't be simpler to use. Just grab one, slap it on the back of the phone using the Z2’s magnets to hold the add-on in place, and you'll be good to go. The Z2 will automatically detect which mod you have attached; for certain special functions, you’ll be asked to download apps such as a dedicated app for the JBL Soundboost 2 speaker mod.New mods arriving with the Z2 include the Turbopower battery ($79.99), which adds a 3,490 power pack to the Z2 Play; the Style Shell ($39.99), which spruces up the phone with a fashionable texture back and wireless-charging capabilities, and the aforementioned JBL Soundboost 2 speaker ($79.99).Because the Z2 Play's mod system is unchanged from last year’s models, you can also use any previous Moto Mods, including Hasselblad's $299.99 camera mod and its 10x optical zoom (which we found disappointing).Each new mod adds an exceptionally simple way to enhance your phone, and all work as advertised, though I still kind of have to question the value of a JBL speaker mod over a standard Bluetooth speaker. Even though it puts out pretty good sound, the Soundboost mod will  work with only a Moto Z phone; in contrast, a Bluetooth speaker is compatible with pretty much anything.The only new mod I didn't get to try out is the new $79.99 Moto Gamepad, which won't be available until later in July. It's kind of a shame, because the Gamepad looks like one of the most promising new mods, as it enhances mobile gaming by adding multiple buttons, analog joy sticks and even a d-pad.Motorola has also announced a new 360-camera Moto Mod, but the company has not revealed pricing or availability for the U.S.In keeping with other recent Moto phones, the Z2 Play features an almost unadulterated version of Android 7.1. That means you get important features such as the Google Assistant and a support for multiwindow mode. Because our review unit was a Verizon model, we still saw the usual assortment of Big Red bloatware.Moto improves upon the stock Android experience with the Moto app, which lets you check notifications by waving your hand over the display. It also supports gesture controls, such as using a chopping motion with the phone in your hand to turn on the flashlight. You can enable gesture control on the home button itself, which lets you navigate back by swiping left, summon your recent apps by swiping right or lock the phone with a hard press.For 2017, Moto has also included the ability to open certain apps just by saying, ""Show me [X]app."" The problem is that even when this feature works — which isn't all the time — the only thing that happens is an icon for the app you want to open appears at the top of the screen. You still have to touch the screen to actually launch the app.There are a few commands like ""Show me my calendar,"" which will take you straight into the app, but  there are not nearly enough of these commands to make this function very useful. And when you consider that the Google Assistant can complete complex tasks like opening Google Maps and looking up directions in a single command, the Moto Voice features seem pretty superfluous.Later this fall, the Moto Z2 Play is in line to get an update to Android Oreo, the latest version of Google's operating system.The battery life on last year's Moto Z Play was a revelation, with that phone lasting an epic 13 hours and 46 minutes on the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing over an LTE network). Even now, the Z Play remains the second longest-lasting phone we've ever tested. The Z2 suffers from Motorola’s decision to go with a smaller battery for a thinner phone.This sleeker sequel lasted 9:34 on Verizon’s network. That’s comparable to the smartphone average, but the G5 Plus lasted nearly 2 hours longer and the older Z Play more than 4 hours longer.The decrease in battery life is assuredly due to the Z2 Play's smaller 3,000 mAh battery, which is down from the 3,510 power pack in the original Z Play. The move to a smaller battery to accommodate the Z2 Play's thinner body is a bad trade-off in my book, because the best thing about the old Z Play was its longevity.The Moto Z2 Play is a pretty good phone, and the new home button and Android 7 are nice additions to what was already a  slick design.  The extra $150 to $200 you’ll spend on the Z2 Play versus the Moto G5 Plus is going toward the phone's modular capabilities and its colorful, and bigger, AMOLED screen. And if those features are important to you, this handset is a sound option for Verizon customers looking for something around $400. Unfortunately, the Z2 Play loses the epic battery life that truly set it apart.The $499 unlocked version is a less compelling buy, especially with the OnePlus 5 now available. OnePlus’ phone is better in pretty much every single way, aside from the modularity, and it costs $20 less"
212,Samsung Galaxy S8 Active,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/samsung-galaxy-s8-active,review-4652.html","Samsung's Galaxy S8 is the best smartphone you can buy right now, but it has one glaring flaw: a glass back. It looks damn good, but the glass also makes the S8 prone to slipping off any slightly tilted surface. And if you don't have a good grip on it, the phone could also slide right out of your hand and onto a hard floor.So Samsung introduced an Active version of the S8. For a $100 premium, the $850 S8 Active offers military-grade protection from the elements in addition to all the features that made the original S8 so great.Is it worth the extra cost and added bulk? I put the S8 Active through its paces to see how it stacked up to the Galaxy S8.As soon as you unbox the Galaxy S8 Active, you can see why Samsung promises the device will survive a 5-foot drop and a water bath of up to 5 feet deep for 30 minutes. The company essentially wrapped an extra-strength smartphone case around the S8's body, which adds some heft to what was once a svelte phone. The S8 Active is 7.6 ounces, compared with the 5.5-ounce original, and it's just a bit larger all-around. A metal frame and textured-plastic back keep the S8 Active protected from the elements (and from humans).The S8 Active is not the best-looking phone, especially compared to the original S8. At first, I wondered why a person wouldn't just buy a rugged case for outdoor adventures and save the money. But for some people, daily life requires more than a case, either because of a demanding job or extreme clumsiness.A friend of mine falls in both categories; her career requires manual labor, and she destroys phones just by looking at them. (This is a person who literally ran over her iPhone with a car — by accident, of course.) She retired her last Galaxy Active device and bought an S8 back in May. The screen is already shattered after it slipped out of her grip. After I let her take the S8 Active for a spin, she very reluctantly gave it back to me.The S8 Active might not survive being run over by a car, but I knocked it off tables and casually tossed it down flights of concrete stairs, and it suffered only a few nicks and scratches around the case. I winced every single time, yet the screen remained intact. The water resistance is less impressive now that it's become a more common smartphone feature, but it's still useful if you're really clumsy in the bathroom or around pools.The S8 Active isn't totally impervious to the elements. I managed to scratch its screen after tossing it in my bag and letting it roll around in there all day. I'm actually frightened to see what's at the bottom of my purse that can scratch this phone, when a few staircase tumbles worthy of a scene in ""Death Becomes Her"" couldn't do it.The S8 Active has a 5.8-inch display with rounded corners and almost no bezels. Basically, it's almost exactly the same as the original, and looks just as good.The Active's 2560 x 1440 AMOLED display reproduces 209.5 percent of the sRGB color gamut, compared with the S8's 183 percent, and offers incredibly accurate color, too, with a Delta-E score of 0.45 compared with the S8's 0.28. (Numbers closer to 0 are better.)I think watching movies on a smartphone screen is something akin to blasphemy, but the S8 Active's 18:5:9 aspect ratio offers a more immersive experience than other phones this size. Even when I had to stretch YouTube videos, such as The Dark Tower trailer, to fit the display, the colors were rich and true to life.The S8 Active's 12-megapixel rear lens and 8-MP front-facing camera are identical to the standard S8's camera system, and just as good. I wish Samsung had put a dual-lens camera in the Galaxy S8 lineup instead of holding it for the Note 8 (the best camera phone you can buy right now), but you'll still capture astonishingly detailed and perfectly lit images, even in harsh daylight. Samsung's photo-processing software is second to none.Samsung made the S8 Active's gesture-driven interface just as intuitive to use as the standard S8's, including advanced features such as one-handed mode and a quick-launch camera. Samsung's digital assistant, Bixby— a rival to Google Assistant and Apple's Siri— gains new capabilities on the S8 Active.Samsung added an Activity Zone on the Bixby home screen, which gives you quick access to your daily health stats, plus a compass, flashlight and stopwatch. I prefer to keep track of my step count and calorie burn on a fitness tracker, which is with me more often than my phone, but your usage may vary.The S8 Active does come preloaded with some AT&T bloatware. On the device we tested, there were nine AT&T apps, including DirecTV, DirecTV Remote, an antivirus app called Lookout and a DriveMode app to keep you from being distracted by calls and texts while driving. With 64GB of storage space (expandable up to 256GB), you still have plenty of room for your own apps.Like the S8 and S8+, the S8 Active runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processor. It's a beast. Whether I was cruising the web with multiple tabs open or sending troops to battle in Clash of Clans, the S8 Active didn't stutter. Its multicore score of 6,328 in the Geekbench 4 test of overall performance was actually higher than the standard S8's score of 6,295.The Galaxy S8 Active's graphics power held its own against the original S8 on 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited test, scoring 36,254 compared with the S8's 36,508.The S8 Active isn't just tougher than the S8; it also lasts longer on a charge than the original model. The rugged version sports a 4,000-mAh battery, compared with the S8's 3,000-mAh battery, so you can squeeze at least an extra half-hour out of the device. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing on 4G LTE), the S8 Active lasted 11:06, compared with the standard S8's 10:39, while the S8+ and its 3,500-mAh battery lasted 11:04. That feat lands the S8 Active on our list of smartphones with the best battery life.We used AT&T's network for the S8 Active, because the device is locked to that wireless carrier, and T-Mobile's network for the regular S8 and S8+, so there could be some variation between the networks.The Samsung Galaxy S8 Active is perfect for people who truly torture their phones. It offers the same great display, camera and performance as the original S8, and it can withstand heaps of abuse. Most of us can get by with a less-expensive phone and a solid smartphone case, but if you're willing to pay a premium for extra protection — and you like AT&T — the S8 Active will be a reliable partner."
213,ZTE Blade Z Max,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/zte-blade-z-max,review-4625.html","Samsung is preparing to ship the Galaxy Note 8, the first of its phones to feature a dual-lens camera. It’s also the first smartphone to clear the $1,000 price ceiling (once you factor in taxes). But you don’t really need to spend that much money for an Android phone with all the bells and whistles. ZTE’s new MetroPCS-exclusive Blade Z Max has a dual-lens camera, fingerprint sensor, beautiful 6-inch display, USB-C port, headphone jack, and it runs Android 7.1, just like the Note 8, for just $130.Comparing the Blade Z Max to the Galaxy Note 8 is unfair, especially when you drill down into important factors like performance, display resolution and image processing. But the Blade Z Max is a perfect example of just how much budget Android phones have improved, giving you flagship-level features at a fraction of the cost.The Blade Z Max sports a dual-lens camera, which isn’t new for ZTE — its Blade V8 Pro, released earlier this year, also sported a two-camera system. But that phone is $230 and still runs Android Marshmallow.The Blade Z Max’s 16-megapixel- and 2-MP rear lenses sit side by side and enable effects like portrait mode, bokeh and monocolor, which creates a “Sin City” effect (black and white with splashes of color). ZTE helpfully highlights those effects in the Camera app under a Dual setting, and you can choose from portrait, bokeh and monocolor there.The image-processing results were uneven in my testing. Portrait mode, which creates a depth effect by bringing the subject of your photo into sharp focus while blurring the background, turned an early morning shot of sunflowers at the Union Square farmers’ market into a beautiful still life on one day. But when I shot flowers in a planter, the lenses brought a passing bicyclist into focus, too — even though he was across the street from the blooms I was photographing.I had better luck with bokeh, which also creates a blurred effect in your photos but allows you more granular controls. You can choose which aperture to shoot in and your subjects can be farther away. When you edit your photos later, you can refocus the image and change the aperture for more or less blur. I used both bokeh and portrait to shoot sunflowers, and preferred bokeh.Monocolor was also pretty neat, though a bit gimmicky. It’s perfect for capturing a black-and-white image of green foliage in a park or a shot of a woman in a red dress, but I didn’t find myself using it that much.The Blade Z Max has a 6-inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) LCD display, and it’s great. I streamed everything from the Tina Fey special edition of Weekend Update to the new Katy Perry music video, and the screen was as bright and the colors as saturated as you would expect from a phone four times the price.Using a light meter, we found that the Blade Z Max reaches a peak brightness of 510 nits, which easily bests the Blade V8 Pro (430 nits) and Huawei’s $200 Honor 6X (444 nits), a comparable budget phone. The Z Max’s display isn’t quite as bright as Motorola’s $230 G5 Plus, which reaches an impressive 591 nits and is one of our favorite phones under $250.The Blade Z Max’s 16-MP and 2-MP rear lenses sit side by side and enable effects like portrait mode, bokeh and monocolor.But the Blade Z Max does have incredible color accuracy with a Delta-E rating of 0.70 (numbers closer to 0 are better). The G5 Plus comes close with a 0.94 rating, but the Z Max again outshines the V8 Pro (2.6) and the Honor 6X (3.28).The only current phone that rivals the Blade Z Max in price is the $160 Blu R1 Plus, which lacks the Z Max’s display quality (with a 1280 x 720 LCD screen), brightness (at just 364 nits) and color accuracy (Delta-E score of 2.67).The Blade Z Max packs in a beast of a battery at 4,080 mAh. ZTE promises up to 31 hours of talk time, but who really talks on the phone that much? We put the Blade Z Max through the Tom’s Guide Battery Test, continuous web surfing over LTE until the battery drains. The phone clocked in at 11 hours and 23 minutes, which lands it on the list of smartphones with longest battery life. The Blade Z Max’s runtime bests the Galaxy S8 and Google’s Pixel XL, but it doesn’t top some of ZTE’s own phones, like the Blade V8 Pro and the Max XL.The device’s use of Qualcomm quick-charging over USB-C adds a ton of value, because you can charge up superfast in a pinch. (I can’t be the only one who forgets her phone is on 20 percent right before leaving the house.)ZTE included a T-Mobile SIM for us to test in the Blade Z Max, which could have affected battery life. Both T-Mobile and MetroPCS use the same LTE network, but MetroPCS customers can be throttled in favor of T-Mobile subscribers if there’s a lot of network congestion.The Blade Z Max handles web-browsing, app-switching and lightweight game-playing just fine, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 octa-core processor and 2GB of RAM doesn’t bring the power you need for more intense games.The Z Max scored a 2,595 on the GeekBench 4 test of overall performance, which falls far short of the Moto G5 Plus’s 3,746 score. (Moto’s phone has a more powerful Snapdragon 625 CPU with 4GB of RAM). However, the Blade Z Max is positively blazing compared with the Blu R1 Plus; that budget phone scored 1,583 with its MediaTek MT6737 1.3-GHz quad-core processor and 3GB of RAM.There’s no getting around it: The Blade Z Max is massive. That’s not a bad quality when it comes to the full-HD 6-inch display, but it can lead to usability issues. Fortunately, ZTE gave it some thought and made the Blade Z Max ultraslim at 0.33 inches. That makes the phone fairly easy to hold. The diamond-textured plastic back also gives the phone some extra grip.ZTE also put the Blade Z Max’s rear camera on the top left of the device, far away from the fingerprint sensor embedded in the center, which means you won’t accidentally smudge either lens trying to unlock your phone. This is something Samsung should really take note of, considering that the camera and fingerprint sensor placement on the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 sit side by side.ZTE made the Blade Z Max exclusive to prepaid carrier MetroPCS. That’s unfortunate if you prefer another network. But if you’re looking for a solid phone that gets great service, you can’t do much better than MetroPCS, which uses T-Mobile’s top-rated 4G LTE network.Earlier this year, we tested network speeds on all four major wireless carriers and five prepaid carriers, including MetroPCS. Since it uses T-Mobile’s network, MetroPCS was the fastest of all the prepaid options, with 22.1 Mbps download and 16.0 Mbps upload speeds.Buying the Blade Z Max will tie you to MetroPCS, but that’s not a bad position to be in.MORE: Best MetroPCS PhonesMark 2017 down as the year that premium phones started to cost more than tablets and laptops. But it will also be the year that phones under $200 finally started to deliver. The Blade Z Max is one of the best of the bunch.Credit: Tom's Guide"
214,Asus ZenFone AR,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/asus-zenfone-ar,review-4596.html","When it comes to augmented and virtual reality on smartphones, it's been an either-or-case for nearly every device up until now. Not so with the Asus ZenFone AR ($599 unlocked, $649 Verizon). The first to combine Google’s Project Tango AR technology with Google Daydream virtual reality, the ZenFone AR is a lean, mixed-reality machine.But the firsts don't stop there. This ZenFone offers a whopping 8GB of RAM supplementing a powerful, though not top-of-the-line, Snapdragon 821 processor. That means smooth performance whether you're exploring virtual worlds, augmenting the physical plane or just kicking back and listening to some jams.While other smartphone makers are using metal or glass to give their devices a premium look, Asus went for leather, and I love it.While other smartphone makers are using metal or glass to give their devices a premium look, Asus went for leather, and I love it. With the exception of the strip of metal holding the three cameras at the top of the handset (more on that later), the rest of the panel is covered in black burnished leather. The material is soft to the touch, while still providing a solid grip.The sides of the phone are made from dark gray aluminum with a touch of pearlescence, giving it a pleasant shimmer. Two silver stripes along the top and bottom of the phone evoke faint  remembrances of old HTC smartphones like the One M8. Along the right side of the phone, you'll find a long volume rocker and power button, while there’s a dual SIM card/microSD slot on the left. Along the bottom sits the 3.5mm audio jack, a USB Type-C port and the speaker.The front of the ZenFone is primarily glass, though the 5.7-inch display is boxed in by some rather thick bezels along the top and bottom. The 8-megapixel front camera resides in the top-right corner, ceding the spotlight to the center-mounted Asus logo. The backlit capacitive Back and Recent apps buttons surround a physical home button.Weighing 5.9 ounces and measuring 6.2 x 3.1 x 0.35 inches, the ZenFone is heavier, taller, wider and thicker than the competition. The LG G6 (5.9 x 2.8 x 0.31 inches, 5.8 ounces) and Samsung Galaxy S8 (5.9 x 2.7 x 0.31 inches, 5.5 ounces) are the same thickness, but the Galaxy S8 is the lightest. And while the Zenfone is a tad large, it's nowhere near as big as the gargantuan Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first Google Project Tango phone.  At 9.1 ounces and 7.1 x 3.5 x 0.4 inches, it’s essentially a tablet.The ZenFone's 2560 x 1440 Super AMOLED display offers vibrant, stunning colors bursting from every pixel. The touch screen can reproduce an incredible 219 percent of the sRGB color gamut, demolishing the 149 percent smartphone average. The GS8 and G6 were pale comparisons at best, with scores of 183 and 134 percent, respectively.The colors popped off the screen during the Black Panther trailer. The Dora Milaje's ruby-red uniforms held my eyes in rapt attention, allowing me to truly appreciate the intricate banding of the chestnut-brown leather straps and polished gold adornments. Details were so sharp that I could make out just about every detail of the tattoo inked on actress' Florence Kasumba's scalp.That extra real estate makes for some sharp detail, which I really appreciated as I played Evil Robot Traffic Jam.But vividness doesn't equate to brightness. The ZenFone averaged 314 nits when we measured the display, falling short of the 443-nit average. The GS8 produced 437 nits, while the G6 delivered an absolutely brilliant 557 nits. The ZenFone's dimness made it difficult to see the screen outdoors, especially in direct sunlight.With a single bottom-firing speaker, the ZenFone gets pretty loud for a smartphone. That's thanks to the phone's 5-magnet speaker and smart amplifier. Created specifically for mobile devices, the amp allows the new speaker to play audio at higher volumes without any distortion.When I listened to Bruno Mars' ""That's What I Like,"" the synths and percussion were pretty clear, although the bass was a bit weak. I wish Asus would have fit two speakers along the bottom, as that lone mono speaker can't deliver the rich stereo quality I prefer. However, I do appreciate that Asus included an outside mode that kills off the bass (which will be lost in open air anyway) and focuses on the mids so the sound travels better.The Project Tango platform is missing a must-have app like Pokemon Go that would justify getting the ZenFone AR over other top handsets.The ZenFone's audio really starts to shine when you pop in a pair of headphones. Using DTS' Headphone: X 7.1 Virtual Surround software, the phone simulates a 7.1-surround-sound home theater. The smartphone also supports Hi-Res audio, so you can stream Tidal or play some FLAC files.The ZenFone is the first phone to feature Google Project Tango and Daydream VR. That means that this smartphone can offer both augmented and virtual reality at the touch of a button. Using Daydream VR is pretty straightforward: You just place and secure the ZenFone in Google’s Daydream VR headset, sit through the 5-minute tutorial, and you're ready to go. To date, there are more than 150 games and apps available for Google Daydream. Many of them are free, but some range in price between 99 cents and $14.99.With its 5.7-inch display, the ZenFone is one of largest Daydream-compatible phones on the market. That extra real estate makes for some sharp detail, which I really appreciated as I played Evil Robot Traffic Jam. The cartoony explosions were a bit sharper on the ZenFone compared to my Samsung Galaxy S8+. When I switched to gunning down enemy aircraft in Bandit Six, the ZenFone also had less motion blur as I quickly changed my view to lock onto the next bogie.While it's definitely nice having a phone that can do virtual reality, it's quickly becoming a ubiquitous feature as more premium phones support Daydream. The ZenFone's real claim to fame is its ability to support Google Project Tango. Similar to the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the ZenFone AR uses a series of cameras to create augmented-reality magic.In addition to the rear-mounted 23MP camera, Asus' TriCam system has a motion-tracking sensor that keeps tabs on the phone's location as it moves through space. There's also the depth-sensing camera that employs an infrared sensor to map the room. Together, the cameras help AR software create seamless overlays onto the real world.MORE: Awesome Things the ZenFone AR Can DoI had the opportunity to play interior designer with the free Wayfair View app curated in the Google Tango app store. After selecting a really cute olive-green ottoman from the catalog, I pointed the ZenFone where I wanted my new virtual furniture. From there, a large box appeared and unfurled, leaving the ottoman right in front of my couch. The footstool was to scale, so I could get a realistic view of how it would look if I decided to purchase the furniture. Even cooler, the closer I got to it, the more detail I could see in the knitted fabric.Project Tango has approximately 30 apps available, which is a drop in the bucket compared with the Daydream library. And while it's fun using the Holo app to watch Spider-Man slink around my living room, Google has its work cut out for it convincing consumers that Tango is more than a fancy gimmick. Home-decorating apps such as Home AR Designer, Lowe's Vision and Magic Plan are a good start, but the platform is missing a must-have app like Pokemon Go, which would justify getting this mixed-reality phone over other top handsets.The ZenFone is outfitted with a 2.4-GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, which isn't the most powerful CPU on the market, but it  features a whopping 8GB of RAM. That means it's going to take a lot to slow the ZenFone down — namely, running a game of Wands in the background with 10 open tabs in Google Chrome while launching the Camera and a few AR apps. And all of that  elicits only a slight stutter when switching between apps.On Geekbench 4, a synthetic performance test, the ZenFone scored 4,224, which is on a par with the G6 (4,073) and its 821 processor. It's more than enough to beat the 3,714 smartphone average, but not the Galaxy S8 and its Snapdragon 835 CPU, which notched 6,124. The OnePlus 5, which also has 8GB of RAM in addition to its Snapdragon 835 CPU, achieved 6.542.When the ZenFone's 23MP rear camera isn't busy mapping rooms for augmented-reality adventures, it takes a darned good photo.The ZenFone had a solid showing on the 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test. The phone hit  31,938, topping the G6's 29,611 and the 21,015 category average. It still couldn't match the GS8, which achieved 35,903.When we ran the Jetstream 1.1 JavaScript test web browser test, the ZenFone matched the phone average with 43.35. Both the G6 and GS8 performed better at 56.2 and 67.5, respectively.When the ZenFone's 23-MP rear camera isn't busy mapping rooms for augmented-reality adventures, it takes a darned good photo. Taking advantage of the sensor's high resolution, Asus loaded up on the camera modes, including Low Light, Beautification, HDR Pro, Depth of Field and 92-MP, which creates an image with an insane 92-megapixel resolution. Some features like Miniature Mode, which makes everything look like it's in a dollhouse, are more gimmicky fun than anything, but hey -- who doesn't like a little whimsy now and then?Fun modes aside, I found that images captured with the ZenFone offered warmer color than my Galaxy S8+. For example, the reddish-brown walnut portion of the Even H2 headphones I'm reviewing looked more lifelike in the ZenFone's shots. My S8+'s photos had a white haze, despite me wiping the lens numerous times. However, I was able to see more of the grain detail in the GS8+ shots.The ZenFone also had the advantage during low-light shots, producing clean photos with clear detail and vivid color in a dimly lit basement bar.The 4K video samples of a busy New York City street I took with the ZenFone delivered gleaming yellows, bold reds and deep blacks as the cars rode by. Details were clear enough that I could easily read the signs across the street.When it came to the front-facing cameras, the ZenFone's 8MP shooter delivered better color, capturing the various shades of purple in my locks. However, my GS8+ produced better detail, letting me see view the individual coils in my curled locs.MORE: Best Camera PhonesUnlike the ZenFone 3 Zoom that came out earlier this year, the ZenFone AR runs Android 7.0 (Nougat) with a ZenUI skin. (Just in time for Google to launch Android O, but you can’t have everything.) The ZenUI interface is clean and slick, with bright, colorful app icons with rounded edges. Switching between apps and home screens is a very smooth experience, but my favorite part about the UI is the customization options.Swiping upward from the bottom of the phone reveals the Manage Home hub, which lets you change how your icons look, how big they are and how they’re aligned. You can also control the scroll effects, font types and color. The little rocket ship icon the software uses as the Close All button is cute, but the notification telling me how much memory was just freed up is sheer genius.Asus kept the ZenFone AR refreshingly free of bloatware on the unlocked version of the handset. However, this might not be the case for the Verizon iteration of the smartphone. Outside of the usual Google apps (Gmail, YouTube and Chrome), the phone has apps for Tango and Daydream that will take you to curated stores and not much else.There's a price to be paid for all this forward-facing tech, and in the case of the ZenFone AR, the cost comes at the expense of the battery life. The smartphone's 3,300-mAH battery lasted only 8 hours and 20 minutes on our battery test, which consists of continuous web surfing over AT&T's 4G LTE network. That result is less than our 9:37 smartphone average as well as the LG G6 and Galaxy S8, which turned in times of 8:39 and 10:39, respectively.The ZenFone's battery life gets even shorter once you start playing with any of the AR or VR apps. I spent 30 minutes playing with several of the Tango apps, only to notice that my battery had gone from 100 percent to 64 percent. The phone does offer Quick Charge technology, which means you can gain a 80 percent charge in approximately 35 minutes.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThe Asus ZenFone AR gives us a tantalizing peek at the future of smartphones. For $599, you get a smartphone powerful enough to support some of Google's most innovative software. There's also the slick customizable user interface and the excellent camera that's vivid, sharp and capable of taking 92 megapixel photos. However, the ZenFone’s battery life could be longer, especially if you plan on running AR or VR programs for any length of time.For $667, you could get the Samsung Galaxy S8 unlocked, which offers longer battery life, better performance and a brighter display. The S8 also supports Google Daydream, so you can explore Google's VR library or check out Samsung Gear VR's expansive library of games and apps. You would, however, lose out on what Google Project Tango's AR has to offer by opting for the S8.However, there's such a small number of apps, you might be better off waiting to see if more developers embrace mixed reality. Apple’s upcoming iPhone 8 is likely to introduce AR capabilities of its own, with Apple already making its ARKit app-building tool available to developers. In other words, expect the AR landscape to change dramatically before the ZenFone AR is even a few months old.Overall, the ZenFone AR is a phone for early adopters who want to have the latest and greatest, but mainstream consumers might want a phone with more familiar features — at least until AR support becomes more widespread."
215,Alcatel Idol 5S,Toms Guide,"https://www.tomsguide.com/us/alcatel-idol-5s,review-4532.html","The Alcatel Idol 5S is looking to carve out its own territory in a crowded field of value-priced phones. And there's plenty here to recommend, including an upscale design and a brilliant, 5.2-inch, full-HD screen. The Idol 5S even features dual front-facing speakers and a built-in fingerprint reader. If you're willing to put up with ads, you can get this phone for just $200 through Amazon Prime, or pay $280 without ""special offers."" Unfortunately, there's one thing about the Idol 5S that kind of spoils the party: subpar battery life.On the inside, the Idol 5S is pretty similar to competing phones, but its exterior is what sets this device apart. It starts with a nearly perfectly symmetrical design, which sports the same-sized bezels on top and bottom and features a pair of front-facing stereo speakers built into the thin strip of aluminum that runs around the outside of the phone. Add in a complete lack of buttons on the device's face and the slick glass panels in front and back, and you get a phone that looks balanced and stately as it lords over its more humbly designed budget competitors.  Around back, the Idol 5S' 12-megapixel rear camera sits nearly flush against the rear of the phone, while a large fingerprint sensor rests within easy reach just above the Idol logo. On the bottom, Alcatel has smartly included both USB-C and a dedicated headset jack, so you won't have to worry about trying to charge your phone and use headphones at the same time. The only real drawback to the Idol 5S' design is its lack of water resistance.The Idol 5S' glass body also gives the phone a slight edge in size, as it measures 5.85 x 2.79 x 0.29 inches and weighs 5.14 ounces. Compare that to the Moto G5 Plus, which also has a 5.2-inch screen but is slightly larger, at 5.91 x 2.91 x 0.38 inches and 5.46 ounces. So, even though the differences between the two phones might not look like a lot on paper, the Idol 5S feels noticeably slimmer in your hand.With solid brightness and a great color range (especially for an LCD display), the Idol 5S' 5.2-inch full-HD screen is pretty much as good as it gets in this price range. When I took a break from writing to watch the latest trailer for Blade Runner 2049, the Idol 5S did an admirable job re-creating all the heavy orange-, blue- and pink-tinted scenes, with colors that looked rich and just barely less saturated than they did on my professionally calibrated desktop monitor. The one quirk I noticed is that the Idol 5S' display runs a little cool, resulting in slightly more-pronounced blues and greens.Featuring a peak brightness of 548 nits, the Idol 5S is way brighter than the 437-nit smartphone average and the ZenFone Zoom 3(421 nits). However, the Idol 5S is still slightly behind the Moto G5 Plus, which was even brighter, at 591 nits.As for color, the Idol 5S covered 162 percent of the sRGB gamut, a score that's significantly better than the 106 percent and 112 percent we saw from the Moto G5 Plus and ZTE Blade V8 Pro, respectively. However, that number still falls short of the results from more-expensive phones that have AMOLED screens, such as the ZenFone Zoom 3, which covered an impressive 220 percent of the sRGB spectrum.Shooting for a blend of speed and energy efficiency, Alcatel opted go with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 CPU on the Idol 5S, in addition to 3GB of RAM, 32GB of built-in storage and microSD expandability. Spec-wise, this puts the Idol 5S on the same playing field as the Asus ZenFone Zoom 3, ZTE Blade V8 Pro and Moto G5 Plus, though the latter two cost slightly less than the Idol 5S.When we tested overall system performance using Geekbench 4, the Idol 5S' multicore score was 4,150. That's higher than the showings by both the ZTE Blade V8 Pro (3,018) and Moto G5 Plus (3,746), and essentially the same at the ZenFone Zoom 3's score (4,193).MORE: Best Smartphones on the Market NowOn 3DMark's Ice Storm Unlimited graphics test, the Idol 5S' score of 13,123 was within 6 percent of the results from competing phones.We also measured browsing performance by running the JetStream 1.1 JavaScript test. The Idol 5S finished with a score of 25; that's lower than but not that far off from the scores of 29.75, 30.3 and 30.74 for the ZenFone Zoom 3, Moto G5 Plus and ZTE Blade V8 Pro.With a 12-megapixel camera in back and a 5-MP selfie cam in front, the Idol 5S sports a pretty standard shooting setup. And wouldn't you know it, the Idol 5S shoots photos about as well as its competition, too.At a nearby farmer's market, the Idol 5S captured an eye-catching array of reds when I shot a selection of cherries, making a similar shot from the Moto G5 Plus look dull by comparison. However, the neon tones on cherries in the center of the shot are a good example of when the Idol 5S pushes its reds a bit too far. Nevertheless, the 5S' shot still provided better white balance and details throughout than the G5 Plus did, which gives the Alcatel phone the win in this test.When I shot a section of Union Square in New York, the Idol 5S delighted with vibrant greens and lots of details on both the statue in the center and the trees in back. And while the Idol's white balance is a bit too yellow, the colors are more accurate and more pleasing to look at that than the Moto G5 Plus overly blue color cast.One thing I noticed is that the Idol 5S' auto HDR is somewhat timid, as it shot standard, non-HDR photos more frequently than the Moto G5 Plus, which is exactly what happened when I snapped a quick shot looking up Broadway toward Midtown Manhattan. The foreground and midground look dark in the Idol 5S' pic, while the Moto G5 Plus came away with something much brighter and more evenly exposed.The Idol 5S' camera had a much more difficult time in low light, as tested in a darkened bar. The image looked dark, fuzzy and really lacking in sharpness. The Moto G5 Plus' shot was slightly brighter, but its overall photo quality wasn't actually that much better.Finally, when I snapped a selfie, the Idol 5S' shot was a bit disappointing, as its pic looked hazy and flat compared to what I got from the Moto G5 Plus.The Idol 5s comes with pretty clean version of Android Nougat 7.1, which includes all of the latest software upgrades such as multiwindow mode, the Google Assistant and nifty little touches like the nighttime blue-light filter and the redesigned settings menu.The one missing feature is Google's Pixel Launcher, which would replace the Idol 5S' standard app-drawer icon with sleeker swipe controls. But since there are a number of ways to customize your launcher on the Google Play store later on, this absence is not really a big deal.Everything was going to so well for the Idol 5S, until we got around to testing battery life. The problem stems largely from the phone's 2,620-mAh battery, which is significantly smaller than those on other phones. On the Tom's Guide Battery Test (continuous web surfing over T-Mobile 4G LTE), the Idol 5S lasted just 7 hours and 39 minutes.MORE: Smartphones with the Longest Battery LifeThat's more than 2 hours behind the current 9:40 smartphone average and even further off times from the Idol's competitors, including the Moto G5 Plus (11:31 from a 3,000-mAh battery), ZTE Blade V8 Pro (12:08 from a 3,140-mAh battery) and ZenFone Zoom 3 (16:49 from a 5,000-mAh battery).The standard retail price for the Idol 5S is $280. However, this phone is also part of Amazon's Prime Exclusive device portfolio, which knocks the price all the way down to $200 in exchange for putting ads and special offers on the phone's lock screen.For those thinking about buying the phone outright and bringing it to their carrier, currently, the Idol 5S will work only on AT&T and T-Mobile. Alcatel says Sprint- and Verizon-compatible versions are on their way, but won't be available until later this summer.At its standard retail price of $280, the Idol 5S seems a bit expensive. Staying in that general price range, you could spend a bit more and go with the $330 Asus ZenFone Zoom and get double the battery life, a vibrant AMOLED screen and way better cameras.But when you look at the $200 Amazon Prime-exclusive model — which lops $80 off the price — things suddenly get a lot more interesting. Now, the Idol 5S costs just $15 more than the $185 Moto G5 Plus and offers a significantly more colorful screen, better speakers and a much more stylish design, while matching the G5 Plus' processing power and offering similar camera performance.The one issue is the Idol 5S' decidedly worse battery life, which makes the ZTE Blade V8 Pro and Moto G5 Plus much better options for people who care about longevity. Unfortunately for the Idol, that's pretty much everyone. It's a real shame, because otherwise, the Idol 5S could have carved out a sweet niche between competing budget and midrange phones.Credit: Shaun Lucas/Tom's GuideCarrier: Unlocked Phone Display Size: 5.2 Display Resolution: 1920 x 1080 Form Factor: Candybar Touch Screen OS Family: Android Operating System: Android 7.1 CPU: Snapdragon 625 Processor Family: Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 RAM: 3GB Memory Expansion Type: microSDHC Display (main): 5.2-inch 1920 x 1080 LCD Bluetooth Type: Bluetooth 4.2 Wi-Fi: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Front Camera Resolution: 8 MP Rear Camera Resolution: 12 MP Ports: 3.5mm Headphone, USB Type-C Size: 5.85 in x 2.79 x 0.29 in Weight: 5.14 ounces"
