0,Sony Xperia 1 III,"October 27, 2021","The Xperia 1 III is another Sony phone aimed at camera fans. It sidesteps software processing tricks, popularized by phones like the Pixel series, instead showcasing Sony’s camera smarts in features like focus tracking and fine-grain controls. The gorgeous 4K screen can run at a smooth 120Hz, but specs like this come at an almost prohibitive price, making it harder to recommend against the best smartphones from Samsung and Apple.  ",Mat Smith,81
1,Google Pixel 6 Pro,"October 25, 2021","For hundreds less than the competition, the Pixel 6 Pro offers everything you’d expect from a flagship and more. It has a lovely 120Hz screen, excellent cameras and a beautiful UI. Plus, Google’s clever AI makes voice typing easier and adds fun photography features. The in-display fingerprint sensor requires patience, but it’s easy to forgive for the price.",Cherlynn Low,91
2,Google Pixel 6,"October 25, 2021","The Pixel 6 is hands-down the best Android phone for the price. For $600, you’re getting excellent cameras, top notch voice recognition, a speedy AI assistant and a 90Hz screen. Fans of smaller phones may miss the old Pixels, and the fingerprint sensor requires patience, but ultimately the Pixel 6 is a steal.",Cherlynn Low,89
3,Microsoft Surface Duo 2,"October 21, 2021","Upgraded hardware and a new Glance Bar don’t mean much when the Duo 2 is still plagued with inconsistent, finicky software. The new triple-camera array is held back by an atrocious camera app, and thermal issues cause the device to hang. All told, the Duo 2 isn’t worth the $1,500.",Cherlynn Low,63
4,Motorola Edge (2021),"October 12, 2021","The 2021 Motorola Edge isn’t without compromises but in adding a fast 144Hz display, a more consistent fingerprint sensor and better software support, it addresses many of the shortcomings we found with its predecessor. If you can get past its sometimes middling camera and the fact it’s missing wireless charging, there’s a lot to like about this phone. ",Igor Bonifacic,82
5,Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max,"September 24, 2021","The iPhone 13 Pro Max is one of the heaviest phones around and outweighs not only its predecessor and similarly large smartphones. If you don’t mind that, you’ll enjoy the Pro Max’s roomy, speedy display, super long-lasting battery and versatile cameras. ",Cherlynn Low,92
6,Apple iPhone 13 Pro,"September 24, 2021","The iPhone 13 Pro, not the regular iPhone 13, is the phone iPhone 12 owners should upgrade to this year. Its ProMotion display alone will make just about everything you do on a phone look buttery smooth, and the powerful A15 Bionic chip blazes through most tasks. Though the camera updates aren’t the main reason the 13 Pro stands out, it still offers high-quality photos and videos, as well as fun features like Cinematic shooting and a macro mode. ",Cherlynn Low,93
7,Apple iPhone 13 mini,"September 21, 2021","The iPhone 13 mini is great for one-handed use, packing a top-tier processor and excellent cameras into an entry-level Apple phone. Unfortunately, it barely lasts a day on a charge. ",Cherlynn Low,86
8,Apple iPhone 13,"September 21, 2021","Though the iPhone 13 doesn’t appear to offer major updates from its predecessor, features like Cinematic Mode and improved HDR processing give its cameras a boost. The A15 Bionic provides ample muscle for all your tasks while squeezing more juice out of the bigger battery, too. If you’ve never used a non-Apple phone, you might not mind the 60Hz display, but anyone else who’s accustomed to higher refresh rates will find the iPhone 13’s screens drag. Still, the iPhone 13 is an excellent flagship that those on iPhone 11 or older will enjoy upgrading to.",Cherlynn Low,91
9,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3,"August 27, 2021","The Z Fold 3 is an impressively refined foldable, with water-resistant hardware that feels sturdier than before. It offers nifty S Pen support, faster screens, capable cameras and some helpful software. But using its outside screen as a regular smartphone is uncomfortable, and its internal display isn’t great for casual texting or browsing.",Cherlynn Low,79
10,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3,"August 19, 2021","The Z Flip 3 is a satisfying upgrade from the original, thanks to water resistance and a larger, more useful Cover Display. Its $1,000 starting price puts it in the same class as flagships from Apple, Google and Samsung itself, too. While it mostly behaves like a regular modern smartphone that you can fold in half, the Flip 3 is held back by battery life and potential durability issues. ",Cherlynn Low,82
11,Google Pixel 5a,"August 17, 2021","The Pixel 5a is basically the Pixel 4a 5G but with added water and dust resistance and a larger battery. It’s about as boring as a phone upgrade can get. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. By worrying less about sourcing the latest chips or designing a phone from the ground up, Google instead focused on performance optimization and extending the battery life to absurd proportions. However, the competition has gotten stiffer in the last year and Google no longer clearly owns the mid range.",Terrence O'Brien,86

13,Google Pixel 5,"October 14, 2020","The Pixel 5 is one of the best small Android phones we’ve used in quite some time, and Google’s clean, feature-rich approach to Android remains  alluring. That said, we’re not sure it’ll make Pixel fans out of people who didn’t already prefer them. That’s partly because of unusual missteps like a lackluster speaker setup and still camera performance that doesn’t beat out the competition the way it used to. More than anything, though, the Pixel 5 is a victim of circumstance: It’s a mostly solid smartphone that would’ve rated higher if some of its rivals weren’t such great values.",Chris Velazco,82
14,Apple iPhone 12,"October 20, 2020","This year’s iPhone 12 is a huge leap by almost every measure from the iPhone 11. And better still, the gap between the 12 and the Apple’s Pro iPhones has closed dramatically. The iPhone 12’s blend of design, performance and price make it as close to a no-brainer as possible, though people who loved the iPhone 11’s battery life will be a little disappointed. Even so, we have no doubt that for most people, the iPhone 12 is absolutely the right choice.",Chris Velazco,91
15,Apple iPhone 12 mini,"November 09, 2020","People who want a smaller phone will be hard-pressed to find a device as compelling as the iPhone 12 mini. That's because Apple took nearly everything that worked well in the larger iPhone 12 including its high-powered A14 Bionic chipset and excellent cameras and packed them into a pint-sized frame. The catch: While the mini offers the same great performance as the larger model, its battery life leaves much to be desired.",Chris Velazco,84
16,Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max,"November 09, 2020","Apple's iPhone 12 Pro Max has a lot in common with its smaller sibling. Think: a new design, expansive 5G network support and amazing performance, to name just a few. Because they're so similar, we think the smaller iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are better options for most people, but if you can handle an enormous screen, the Pro Max's better battery life and more flexible cameras make it Apple's most capable new model, and an all-around fantastic smartphone.",Chris Velazco,92
17,Apple iPhone 12 Pro,"October 20, 2020","Compared to the iPhone 12, the new iPhone  12 Pro is a considerably tougher sell. But it still might be worth it for some. It packs the same great performance and display as the standard 12, but with more storage at the base level, a much more flexible camera setup, and LiDAR for improved augmented reality experiences. It’s worth the step up if photography is your priority, but you still want a relatively compact phone. But if you simply want the best of the best, camera-wise, you should wait to see how things shake out with the iPhone 12 Pro Max.",Chris Velazco,89
18,Samsung Galaxy S21,"January 21, 2021","The Galaxy S21 is the smallest and cheapest of Samsung’s latest trio of flagships and it offers an intriguing mix of features for the price. You’ll get the same top-tier processor as its two bigger stablemates and the same 120Hz refresh rate, but a lower resolution. It has one fewer camera than the S21 Ultra with less-sharp sensors, but otherwise still offers a versatile imaging system. Plus, it has a brand new look, a long-lasting battery and most of Samsung’s useful software. For the money, you’ll have a hard time finding a better Android flagship.",Cherlynn Low,88

20,Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra,"January 21, 2021","Samsung’s Galaxy 21 Ultra might not pack many dramatic upgrades, but it’s a polished powerhouse that’s remarkably competent on all fronts. Bear in mind, that doesn’t mean it’s perfect -- some of its features aren’t as immediately useful as we had hoped, and the loss of expandable storage could be tough for some power users to swallow. The Ultra’s price and size still might put it out of reach for some, but if you can justify the cost -- or don’t mind waiting for a deal -- the good far outweighs the bad here.",Chris Velazco,89
21,OnePlus 9 Pro 5G,"March 23, 2021","OnePlus has been churning out solid smartphones for years, but the new OnePlus 9 Pro is a true flagship — with a high price to match. Between its impeccable display, excellent performance, thoughtful software and improved camera experience, all of the premium smartphone features are present and pleasant to use. Fans of bells and whistles may want to look elsewhere — perhaps at devices like the Galaxy S21 Ultra — but anyone who values the feeling of speed above all else will find a lot to like here.",Chris Velazco,88
22,OnePlus Nord N200 5G,"June 24, 2021","For $240, the OnePlus Nord N200 5G offers compelling features like a 90hz screen and triple camera system -- but only on paper. In reality, there are caveats like an LCD panel and sluggish performance that make it an average budget phone.",Cherlynn Low,68
23,Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders,"August 16, 2021","The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders was made for Qualcomm’s fans who should appreciate fast screens, large batteries and great performance. But important features like high-res audio support and cameras are pending a software update that will only be available later, making it hard to evaluate those aspects. Even then, there are better alternatives for even the most specs-obsessed power users, and the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is ultimately a concept phone or reference design not suitable for most.",Cherlynn Low,62
24,Microsoft Surface Duo,"September 10, 2020","The Surface Duo is decent as a phone, quite bad as a tablet, and somewhat functional as everything in between. That is, when the software works as promised. But bugs and app incompatibility plague this $1,399 device, which will need monthly updates from Microsoft to fix its numerous issues.",Cherlynn Low,71

34,Google Pixel 4a 5G,"October 14, 2020","If you want a new Pixel with a bigger screen, wide-angle camera, 5G and a headphone jack, the Pixel 4a 5G is the phone for you. But most budget conscious shoppers will find the $350 Pixel 4a a well-rounded option while those who can spend more should get the Pixel 5 for the peace of mind that water resistance buys. With its capable cameras, all-day battery and $500 starting price, though, the Pixel 4a 5G is a good phone for the few people who have such specific needs.",Cherlynn Low,86
35,OnePlus 8T,"October 14, 2020","OnePlus’ latest phone is basically the OnePlus 8 Pro’s top-notch screen refresh rate and battery stuffed into a smaller body. Then there’s the awesome 39-minute fast charging tech, to sweeten the deal. The OnePlus 8T is only marred by subpar cameras and a less unique design.",Richard Lai,84
36,Sony Xperia 1 II,"July 13, 2020","The $1,200 Xperia 1 ii is many things, but a crowd-pleaser it is not. In fact, its charm derives from how niche it is. It has a screen meant for movie nerds. Its cameras are meant for film and photo nerds. And thankfully, it’s more than solid in all the other departments that matter, like performance, battery life, and overall software quality. Ultimately, it's that unabashed geekery that will either win you over or drive you away. For people who relish the thrill of laboring over camera settings to get just the right photo or snippet of footage, the Xperia 1 ii scratches that itch like no other phone.",Chris Velazco,86

41,OnePlus Nord,"July 27, 2020","OnePlus’ return to mid-range smartphones presents  some strong competition to both older flagships and the current crop of budget devices. It has a big 6.4-inch screen that can run at 90Hz for a smoother software experience. OnePlus has also packed in enough camera tech to ensure the Nord takes decent photos, with all the flexibility of a four-sensor setup. With 5G and a just-about-good-enough processor, the price is right, even if this phone is unlikely to make it to the US.",Mat Smith,85

It also offers helpful Pixel-only tools like Live Caption for Calls, Call Screening, Recorder and Personal Safety features.  Though it only comes in one color option and just a single rear camera, the Pixel 4a still manages to be the best phone for the price.",Cherlynn Low,91

46,Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra,"August 18, 2020","The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra feels a lot like a phone for the one percent -- and not just because it's expensive. It's because the things the Note 20 Ultra excels at, like note-taking tools and wireless desktop features won't really matter to most people. If you want a Samsung phone with a big screen and great performance, you could find a great deal on some like a Galaxy S20 Plus. If you just want something fast, buy a OnePlus 8 Pro. But Samsung is counting on the fact that some people out there still get viscerally excited by ungainly displays and high-performance everything and, yes, smarter ways to take notes. If that's you, the Note 20 Ultra fills that niche like nothing else can.",Chris Velazco,86
47,Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2,"September 11, 2020","With the Galaxy Z Fold 2, Samsung might just have the first great foldable. Its design has been fortified significantly. Both of its screens are bigger and better than before. It uses the fastest smartphone processor you’ll find in an Android phone today. And best of all, the Fold 2 is even more capable than the last one. When it comes to hardware, Samsung did a fantastic job. But the future of devices like isn’t just about hardware. Some of Samsung’s software choices continue to confuse, and getting the most of the Fold 2 requires plenty of time and effort. Beyond that, lingering app compatibility issues mean devices like the Fold 2 still feel inconsistent. Samsung did the hard work of making hardware that’s worth using — now we just need developers to start taking these things seriously.",Chris Velazco,77

52,Motorola Edge+,"April 30, 2020","On paper, the Motorola Edge Plus has everything it needs to compete with the best phones out there right now. The reality, however, is a little different. Motorola’s first flagship in years offers first-rate performance, clean software (once you get rid of Verizon’s bloatware) and some truly excellent battery life. Unfortunately, the phone’s marquee feature -- its spacious Endless Edge display -- feels like an example of style over substance, and could make the phone difficult for some to use. All told, the Edge Plus gets enough right to make it a competent flagship, but one that won't best its competition. ",Chris Velazco,79

Well, more consistent performance, for one. Despite using a reasonably powerful chipset, the A51 is often plagued by slow app launches and laggy animations, to the point when it sometimes feels like a device that costs much less. Battery life wasn’t as good as we had hoped for, either.

Don't be fooled, though: Between its excellent performance, well-thought-out software and one of the best smartphone screens we've ever seen, the OnePlus 8 Pro is a fantastic smartphone that's well worth the price of admission. Don't assume everything is perfect here -- some of the company's camera choices are questionable and a slightly bigger battery would've gone a long way.

75,LG V60 ThinQ 5G,"April 10, 2020","By itself, the V60 ThinQ is a fascinating exercise in compromise. To get its price under $1,000 (the current standard for a flagship), LG went with a lower-resolution screen, fewer rear cameras and less RAM than it rivals. That sounds like a great way to build a mediocre smartphone, but these compromises are easy to live with. Chances are you’ll wind up with a free dual-screen case too. Calling this thing polished would be a stretch, but if you’re willing to put in the work, it can be a very useful add-on. All told, the V60 offers solid performance, plus some of the best battery life we’ve seen so far this year, all for less money than competing devices. It’s still a little rough around the edges, but it’s nothing if not a good deal.",Chris Velazco,81

We can't deny that flipping a phone open and closed in 2020 comes with a unique sense of satisfaction, but the compromises Motorola had to make here -- dim, low-res screen, mid-range chipset, purely average battery, lackluster cameras -- make the Razr nearly impossible to recommended. (That it's a Verizon exclusive isn't great either.) Ultimately, the Razr is an undeniably cool phone; it's just one that doesn't act or feel like it should cost $1,500.",Chris Velazco,61

It also features a trio of advanced cameras on its rear that can shoot up to 108-megapixel-sharp pictures, 8K video and get as close as 100x to a subject. But Samsung’s camera software is pretty rough. Plus, the Ultra’s size and weight make it unwieldy and basically impossible to fit most pockets. The S20 Ultra is a good phone, But for a whopping $1,400, it needs to be more than good. And sadly it falls shy of greatness.",Cherlynn Low,80

The doodling experience is hampered by a lack of palm rejection, but the fact that the option remains to take quick, handwritten notes will compel some to consider it. Aside from the pen, the G Stylus is almost identical to the Moto G Power and it has solid performance plus a great 14-hour battery life. It takes its best photos in good lighting and, while the included macro lens is a strange choice, it ultimately adds a unique flare that makes it stand out among other mid-range smartphones. However, the G Power’s lack of NFC, disappointing Night Mode photography and its plastic design prove that sacrifice is necessary when opting for a more affordable handset.",Valentina Palladino,76

Attach its Dual Screen case, though, and things suddenly get more interesting. Combined, these devices offer a taste of the multi-screen life other companies have attempted to popularize, and they’re surprisingly good for multitasking. After all, the G8X and its second screen often act like two entirely separate phones. Where LG falls short is polish: Some experiences that use both screens can be finicky or feel limited. If you can find a good deal on a G8X and its second screen, it’s definitely worth consideration.",Chris Velazco,74

120,Samsung Galaxy Fold,"October 14, 2019","Samsung’s Galaxy Fold is one of those devices that inspires adoration and annoyance at the same time. Its foldable design means you can carry around a tablet in your pocket and get plenty of work done along the way. The Fold’s power and flexibility nothing short of intoxicating, but as a commercial product, it leaves much to be desired. While closed, it’s chunky and clumsy, and we have serious concerns about how well its main screen will hold up over time -- our review unit's display developed dead and stuck pixels out of the blue, and we've seen a few other units with more pronounced blemishes. The Galaxy Fold offers a glimpse at the future of smartphones and gives Samsung a potent foundation to build on, but almost no one should consider buying one right now.",Chris Velazco,70

126,Google Pixel 4 XL,"October 21, 2019","The Pixel 4 XL packs all of the same new features as its smaller siblings, and on the whole, these additions should be enough to excite even wary Pixel fans. It’s fast, thoughtful, and benefits from additions like a big, 90Hz screen and the ambitious Motion Sense system — when it works correctly, that is. Beyond all that, though, the Pixel 4 XL’s real draw is its bigger battery. It’s still doesn’t last as long as some of the Pixel’s rivals, but it’s noticeably better than what the standard Pixel 4 is capable of. If you’re enthusiastic about Google’s new additions and don’t mind a bigger phone, the Pixel 4 XL is clearly the model to invest in.",Chris Velazco,85
127,Google Pixel 4,"October 21, 2019","Google’s Pixel phones have a reputation for thoughtful software and impressive cameras, but this year’s Pixel 4 represents a step in a new direction. Motion Sense makes it possible to control the phone without touching it, and some key improvements make Google Assistant faster and more capable. When everything works the way it’s supposed to, the Pixel 4 feels like a taste of the future. It’s too bad, then, that some of its most important new additions don’t work as well as they’re supposed to, and that the phone’s small battery can be limiting. While those issues don’t disqualify the Pixel 4, they mean this smaller model is harder to embrace than in years past.",Chris Velazco,83

137,Apple iPhone 11 Pro,"September 17, 2019","Apple’s new flagship is packed to the brim with new components, but the changes that really stand out are its flexible triple camera and the significant improvements to battery life. Day-to-day performance is faster than last year’s premium iPhones, but often only just, and many will be hard-pressed to spot the differences between these new Super Retina XDR displays and the ones we got last year. The iPhone 11 Pro represents Apple at the peak of its smartphone game, but it might not be a must-buy if you’re a frequent upgrader.",Chris Velazco,90

That’s not a bad thing, though: It offers a trio of solid cameras and top-of-the-line performance (though you might not notice the difference much if you’re coming from a recent iPhone). iOS 13 packs plenty of handy new features too, though it doesn’t do anything new to take advantage of the Pro Max’s big, 6.5-inch screen. All told, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is well worth the upgrade if you need a big phone, but be sure to try out the fast, cheap iPhone 11 before you pull the trigger. ",Chris Velazco,90
