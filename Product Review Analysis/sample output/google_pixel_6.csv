0,Toms Guide,https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/google-pixel-6,"Google's new Pixel 6 is a big improvement over last year's Pixel 5. The phone's price depends on where you buy your phone. At Verizon and AT&T, you'll pay more for the Pixel 6  $699 at Verizon and $739 atAT&T. The reason for the price discrepancy comes down to 5G. The Google Pixel 6 has a larger 6.4-inch display than the iPhone 13 and Samsung Galaxy S21. At 7.3 ounces, the Pixel 6 is pretty hefty, too; the OnePlus 9 weighs in at 6.77 ounces. The Pixel 6 offers an adaptive 90Hz refresh rate, scaling up when your on-screen activity would benefit. Both phones did well at night, with their respective night modes able to cleanly capture some Halloween decorations perched in an orange tree. The Pixel 6's Night Sight has the more realistic shot, with a cooler color cast that retains the shadows on the skull. Motion is a new mode that takes flat, static images and livens them up with blurs to denote movement. The Pixel 6's Tensor chip is a step or two behind the Qualcomm Snapdragon X60 modem found in current flagships such as the iPhone 13 and Galaxy S21. With its 90Hz refresh rate enabled, the Pixel 6 lasted for 8 hours and 13 minutes on T-Mobile's 5G network. The Pixel 6 can take comfort in how it performed in a real-world test where we use Adobe Premiere Rush to transcode 4K video. The Pixel 6 introduces the world to Android 12, Google's latest software update for Android phones. Android 12 introduces us to Google's new Material You interface that's baked right into the Pixel 6. The most valuable implementation is an interpreter feature that lets the Google Assistant listen to and translate spoken text. The excellent Recorder app now can record and transcribe German and Japanese. The Pixel 6 is the best phone Google's ever made. But that doesn't mean it's necessarily ready to supplant flagships from Apple and Samsung. Tensor seems like a welcome addition to the Pixel lineup. Android fans who want the best out of Google's software would do well to consider an upgrade."

It has a new look, a chip designed to Googles spec, and a completely new camera sensor. But how does it compare to the other big Android hitters like the Galaxy S21 Plus, OnePlus 9 Pro and Apples latest iPhone 13 Pro? The Pixel 6 has a 6.4-inch HDR OLED panel with an in-display fingerprint scanner. The screen has a refresh rate that can switch between 60 and 90Hz, and a 1080p resolution. The phone comes with an IP68 rating, which guards against any water-based accidents. It is also small enough to slide into decent-sized handbags and back pockets. The Pixel 6 is the first phone to use Googles Tensor chipset. It also features a number of elements that Google has been refining over the years, including a focus AI and ML (machine learning) Tensor should give Google more control over the phone and its likely one of the reasons the search giant is now promising a minimum of five years of security updates. The Google Pixel 6 runs Android 12 and the Material You theming engine. This is the biggest year-on-year jump I have ever seen in a phone. Theres 5G support too and 8GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB of storage. There is no charger in the box so you'll have to provide your own. The battery life is good but not among the fastest around. The Google Pixel 6 is the latest Android phone to be reviewed by Trusted Reviews. The Pixel 6 has an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front-facing camera. The phone is priced at $599 and is available for pre-order from Google.com. It is not available for sale in the UK but is available in the US. Google Pixel 6 Pro, 6.7 inches, 128GB, 256GB, 50MP + 12MP + 48MP. Android 12, 12 inches, 8GB, USB Type-C. Google Tensor, $849. Android 7.0, 8.0 inches, 5.5 inches, 3.9 inches."
2,T3,https://www.t3.com/us/reviews/google-pixel-6-review,"The Google Pixel 6 is the first phone from Google that can truly go up against the likes of Samsung, Apple and Huawei at the top end of the premium smartphone spectrum. It's available now for 599 in the UK and $699 in the US. The phone is officially IP68-rated, meaning it's able to survive being submerged in water at a depth of 1.5 metres (nearly 5 feet) for up to 30 minutes. Google claims that the main image sensor captures 150-percent more light than the Pixel 5. Google has added a few new tricks in the form of 'Motion Mode' which aims to make everyday shots more epic with action shots and long exposures. Face Unblur helps to clearly capture faces even in the toughest conditions, as well as 'Real Tone' If youre only looking at Android phones then theOnePlus 9could be a good choice. It's around the same size, with a 6.55-inch screen, housed in a slim and lightweight handset. Its a very impressive phone all around, and it's about the same price, too."
3,Nextpit,https://www.nextpit.com/google-pixel-6-review,"The Google Pixel 6 marks a real break compared to its predecessors, if only visually. The horizontally arranged camera module that Google has dubbed as the camera bar has everything to become a signature of the Pixel range. The 6.4-inch Full HD+ (1080 x 2400) AMOLED display is quite smooth. Tensor is a custom-developed system on a chip (SoC) that is the first in the world to feature not one, but two large Cortex-X1 cores in its processor. Tensor is supposed to be an AI-focused SoC rather than a graphics-focused one. This explains why the SoC finally heats up little but also why it barely exceeds its competitors in computing power (CPU) With the Pixel 6, I've found the cropping to be very clean. Even the tiniest strand of hair in my ugly mane doesn't escape Google. The PIxel 6 is able to shoot in 4K at 60 FPS and offers 4 types of stabilization depending on the use and situation. Google's Pixel 6 is a flagship phone for $599. It has a powerful processor that outperforms its competitors. It also has a telephoto lens and 128GB of storage. Not everything is perfect, though. Fast charging is a little too slow for my liking, and the 3 years of major Android updates are far from revolutionary."
