0,apple iphone 11,"Just like last year, Apple released three new iPhones in 2019. The Apple iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max are priced upwards Rs.99,990, whereas the iPhone 11 retails for Rs. 65,000. In fact, it is priced less than the launch price of its predecessor - the iPhone XR.Rating: 4.5/5PROS  Camera PerformanceGaming PerformanceBattery Life    CONS  Fast Charger Not Included In The BoxLow Resolution ScreenWith an almost similar looking design, the iPhone 11 might not look a much of an upgrade over the iPhone XR. But, the iPhone 11 brings a few notable upgrades. The internals are exactly similar to the Pro series and promises to last longer than the iPhone XR. So, how does the iPhone 11 perform in the real world? And how it is a computational powerhouse? Should one spend over Rs. 65,000 on this device? I've tried explaining the same in this detailed review.Design  Subtle Changes That Make A Lot Of Difference From the front side, the iPhone XR and the iPhone 11 look exactly similar to each other. However, turning these devices to the rear side reveals some of the design changes. The iPhone 11 comes with a bigger Apple logo and the obvious dual camera setup. The phone uses a glass sandwich design with an aluminum frame and ships in six interesting colors, including black"
1,apple iphone 12 pro,"Apple might have delayed the iPhone launch this year but it pretty much made up for it by this year's lineup. The company introduced four new iPhone 12 models which are now available for purchase in India, powered by the latest A14 Bionic chipset with 5G networking capabilities.Rating: 4.5/5PROS  Excellent design5G support5nm A14 Bionic processorMagSafe    CONS  ExpensiveCharger not included in the boxFor those who want the most compact iPhone, there is the iPhone 12 mini, for those who are looking for the most value-for-money iPhone, there is the iPhone 12. For those who want the best of everything, there is the iPhone 12 Pro Max. And for those, who want a little bit of everything, there is the iPhone 12 Pro.The iPhone 12 Pro is similar in size to the iPhone 12. However, it has few attributes that gives it an extra edge. Unlike the iPhone 12, the base model of the iPhone 12 Pro offers 128GB internal storage and retails for Rs. 1,19,900, and the price goes up to Rs. 1,49,900 for the top-end version with 512GB internal storage.I have been testing the Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro with 512GB internal storage for the last few weeks, and here is my take on the newest flagship smartphone from Apple."
2,apple iphone 13,"The iPhone 13 (from $799) doesnt seem very new when you first look at it. But when you start using this flagship, you realize that it delivers a lot more than a smaller notch. The new iPhones display is brighter than its predecessors. The battery life is longer. And Apple has improved an already great camera with new sensors and computational photography features that make you feel like a pro (even on a non-Pro phone).Yes, the A15 Bionic powering the iPhone 13 is once again the fastest chip in the land. But its more about what this chip lets you do. This includes Cinematic mode, which adds depth of field to your videos while automatically shifting focus, and Photographic Styles for changing the look of your pics.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.Check out our iPhone 13 mini review if you want all the same features of the iPhone 13 in a smaller design. Want a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom? See our iPhone 13 Pro review. And our iPhone 13 Pro Max review is the place to go if you want the biggest screen.Of course, if you decide you want"
3,apple iphone se,"In what was perhaps the worst kept secret in company history, Apple on Monday announced the 4-inch iPhone SE, a phone that looks similar to the now nearly four-year old iPhone 5, but boasts innards that are identical to the current flagships iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus.The launch event was held at the Apple campus at 1 Infinite Loop in Cupertino, and compared to most iPhone launches of the past, it was a relatively small affair. Gadgets 360 was there at the event and we hope you enjoyed the live updates that we brought you from the event. We got some chance to spend some time with the iPhone SE and other new launches like the smaller iPad Pro at the hands on area after the event and here are some quick thoughts worth sharing.If, like us, you've been using a big phone like the iPhone 6s Plus as your primary device, the iPhone SE feels really light by comparison. We were really surprised at how light the device felt when we first held it in hand - the feeling was like holding a smartphone where someone hadn't put the battery in yet. When you consider that at 113 grams the SE is a gram heavier than the iPhone 5s, the feel is more a testament to how we've gotten used to bigger, heavier phones, than anything truly new or revolutionary about the iPhone SE's design.Having said that, the iPhone SE"
4,asus rog phone,"As games like Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds continue to reign supreme on our phones, companies like Asus are betting that consumers will want a smartphone with a little more oomph to handle the influx. Enter the ROG Phone.Priced at $1,099, the ROG is one of the most powerful phones on the market, thanks to its overclocked Snapdragon 845 processor. And thanks to some cleverly placed haptics and a bright, beautiful OLED display and loud audio, it's ideal for gaming or just watching a movie. I'm still not sure if the world wants or needs a dedicated gaming phone, but the ROG Phone is one of Asus' most compelling to date. See all of our top picks for best phones.The ROG Phone's design is definitely polarizing. Made from a mix of glass and metal, the mobile device is  leaning into the whole ""gamer phone"" look. When I passed the phone around the office, my colleagues called it aggressive and over-the-top, words you'd seldom hear used to describe a smartphone. But I think the look is rather refreshing.You get the first inkling that the ROG isn't like the other phones when you take a look at the front. A pair of copper accents breaks up the monotony of the black top and bottom bezels. A few"

Think about it. Which is going to get more use: A device that you have to hook up to your living room TV for games and movies, or a device that you can take with you absolutely anywhere and use for any number of productivity and leisure activities?And yet, the ROG Phone 3 isn't just the best gaming phone available right now; it's arguably one of the best handheld gaming consoles out there  provided you like Android games, at any rate.As a gaming device, the ROG Phone 3 succeeds in just about every way. It plays high-"

After all, since these devices use the same system on chip as the other best Android phones, what advantages could they possibly offer over a regular handset? The improvements seemed marginal, at least to me.But gaming phones have thrived, in part by pushing features like fast-refreshing displays to the mainstream. And so Asus is back with a new generation of its ROG phone, which will be available in three different colors"
7,asus zenfone 5z,"Asus wants a slice of the pie. No, not that Pie  the company hasn't updated its smartphones to the latest version of Android quite yet. Rather, it wants to edge its way into the budget flagship niche market that OnePlus and Honor have dominated in recent years.That explains the $499 Asus ZenFone 5Z, a Snapdragon 845-powered handset with looks reminiscent of the iPhone X and a hodgepodge of features containing ""AI"" in the label.That may as well describe half the premium Android phones we've seen this year, but it's hard to be cynical about that price  the ZenFone 5Z costs $30 less than the $529 OnePlus 6 and boasts the kind of power most companies typically demand hundreds more for.However, specs tell only half the story, and the ZenFone 5Z's knockoff looks and nonintuitive software won't have you mistaking it for a $1,000 iPhone X. If you can put up with that, Asus' latest offering is a terrific value.The ZenFone 5Z costs $499 and comes in a single configuration featuring 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The latter can be expanded by up to 2TB with a microSD card, though using external memory consumes one of the phone's dual SIM slots. Two colors are available  Midnight Blue and Meteor Silver  and the phone"
8,asus zenfone 6,"Global sales of smartphones may be slumping, but that's working out pretty well for folks like you and me. Phone makers, desperate to get us to buy their devices, are increasingly cranking out models that offer as many premium features as possible without also driving up the price so high that it turns off would-be customers. Asus' latest flagship phone, the ZenFone 6, fits squarely in this category of aggressively priced premium handsets, and it's one of the best unlocked phones you can buy.The ZenFone 6 is now available to order in the U.S., where you can buy the base model (6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage) for $499. In addition to Asus' store, you can get the phone at Amazon, B&H and Mobile Advance. B&H lets you opt for the 128GB configuration for an extra $100. Asus also makes models with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, though we're not seeing those on sale as of this writing. (A microSD slot lets you expand storage to 2TB on the phone if you're so inclined.)The ZenFone 6 is available unlocked. It only works with GSM-based carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile as well as the many prepaid and discount carriers that use those companies' networks.It's impossible to talk about the ZenFone"

Asus may be a big name in the computing world, but its quite the underdog when it comes to phones. A few years back, the company rejected camera notches and cutouts, turning to a flipping camera module on the Zenfone 6. But the Zenfone 8 takes a more conventional approach to smartphone design and refines it. It does this in a small, compact frame with a ton of horsepower, a great display and good cameras.With a large battery, a fast-refreshing display, and a headphone jack,"
10,asus zenfone zoom,"Innovation tends to reach a saturation point after a while, which bogs down pretty much ever facet of technology. What do you do when those eureka moments start drying up and you find yourself looking for something new to wow your audience with? Putting a fresh spin on old technology seems like one way to go about it. Smartphone cameras with optical zoom have been around ever since Nokia launched the N90, way back when. This didn't exactly catch on since no one likes carrying a bulky camera in their pockets, which is what these phones essentially were.Samsung has toyed with this idea a bit, with its last attempt being the Galaxy K Zoom over two years ago. The 10X optical zoom was the highlight of this phone but it was still more of a digital camera than a smartphone. Asus has never known to shy away from experimenting with hybrid devices and its latest incarnation is the ZenFone Zoom. This is its attempt at a smartphone with optical zoom and thankfully, it hasn't compromised (too much) on it being a smartphone. Can the ZenFone Zoom breathe new life into this non-starter of a segment? Let's find out.Look and feelThe ZenFone Zoom is priced at a premium and it's certainly dressed for the part. The unibody aluminium frame looks good and also gives the phone a good grip. The rounded sides make it very comfortable"
11,black shark 2,"We buy consoles and PCs built for gaming, so why not buy gaming-focused smartphones, too? This is the philosophy behind some of the past year's most interesting handsets, from the likes of Asus' ROG Phone and the Razer Phone 2. And now, a new contender has joined the fray.You may never have heard of Black Shark, and that's for a very good reason: the company was founded only in 2017. Chinese tech giant Xiaomi owns a 46 percent stake in the firm, though Black Shark is adamant that it and Xiaomi don't utilize the same production lines or research and development personnel.Black Shark's first handset came out almost exactly a year ago and made it outside China only last November, when the phone went on sale in the U.K. and Europe. Now, there's a second device out, and it won't land on American shores either. However, at the low, low price of 479 ($625)   50 less than the OnePlus 6T  the Black Shark 2 is a bargain of a flagship handset that might just be worth the frustration of importing.Black Shark 2 SpecsBlack Shark hasn't completely ruled out sales in the U.S., but like many Chinese phone makers, the company is staying out of North America for now. That said, you can import the Black Shark 2 to the States, and it will work on some phones"
12,blackberry key2 le,"When TCL released the BlackBerry Key2 earlier this year, we were impressed by Chinese phone maker TCL's second stab at building a BlackBerry with a physical keyboard. But we weren't as enamored with the handset's price: $649, which was $100 more than its predecessor's for reasons we found hard to justify.Perhaps TCL saw the error of of its ways, or maybe just an opportunity. Because shortly after the Key2's debut, the company announced a less expensive and less powerful variant named the Key2 LE. This BlackBerry downgrades its processor, RAM, cameras and battery size and trades its aluminum construction for polycarbonate. In doing so, it manages to hit a much more reasonable price of $449  $200 less than the Key2.But with all those compromises working against it, can the Key2 LE remain a worthy contender for enterprise users? Here's what the new phone brings to the table, and where it succeeds and fails against its pricier rival in the BlackBerry family.TCL announced at CES 2019 that the BlackBerry Key2 LE will soon be available through Verizon for that carrier's business customers. We've updated the availability section of this review to reflect that.The Key2 LE normally costs $449 (349) but is available for $429 from Amazon and Best Buy as of this writing. Like the regular Key2, this new version will"
13,blackberry keyone,"Let's be blunt: We will never return to BlackBerry's glory days, when phones stamped with that company's logo ruled the mobile world. But that doesn't mean that BlackBerry has to settle for being a distant also-ran in a world dominated by phones from Apple and Samsung. TCL now makes phones under the BlackBerry banner, using that company's security-focused software and branding on an Android device. And with the $549 BlackBerry KeyOne, TCL has produced a phone that will remind you of BlackBerry's glory days.The KeyOne blends a very powerful physical keyboard with an all-day battery in a phone that a lot of productivity addicts will be happy to use, both around the office and at home. The processor inside the KeyOne feels a little underpowered and that price tag seems steep, but this is a phone that ultimately helps you get the job done. A new model of the BlackBerry KeyOne, the Black Edition, is now up for sale in the U.S. through Amazon and Best Buy. The KeyOne Black Edition retails for $549 and features 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, compared to the 3GB and 32GB in the standard KeyOne, respectively. The Black Edition was previously sold internationally late last summer, but is only now being offered stateside.TCL has packed a lot of phone around a fairly minimal screen. The KeyOne"
14,blackberry priv,"We've been following BlackBerry's journey from the top of the smartphone market to the bottom, and it has been extremely tempting on multiple occasions to declare the company effectively dead. Poor decision after poor decision has resulted in the company's products - which were the absolute must-have status symbols of an entire generation - being seen now as relics from the distant past. There are holdouts, no doubt, but their number is diminishing every day.`BlackBerry, the company formerly known as Research in Motion, has had many chances over the past few years to set its course right, but has instead launched one outlandish product after another; trying anything that might work. We liked the unusually shaped Passport  (Review | Pictures), but it was never going to be a mass-market success. More recently, the Classic  (Review | Pictures) represented a U-turn in strategy to cater to everyone who hated BB10's touch interface, and the Leap (Review) tried to appeal to budget-minded fans but missed that mark spectacularly.We now have yet another strategy shift, in the form of the BlackBerry Priv. The company has finally caved to pressure and adopted Android, turning its famous business-first ecosystem into a collection of apps and services. However, priced at Rs. 62,990, this phone has its work cut out for it. Is the Priv finally going to give BlackBerry the same"
15,coolpad mega 2.5d,"While the battle for supremacy in the sub-Rs.15,000 smartphone segment rages on, there's a new one brewing in the sub-Rs.10,000 price bracket. Xiaomi recently added fuel to the embers when it launched the Redmi 3s and Redmi 3s Prime (Review), two excellent options that deliver great bang for buck.Coolpad, another Chinese company known for disrupting the budget segment, announced its answer to Xiaomi's offering with the launch of the Mega 2.5D. Available only through the flash sale model for now, the Mega 2.5D is a selfie-focused smartphone with big emphasis on design. Although it might seem like major competition for the Redmi 3s, we feel the Mega 2.5D is poised to be an alternative for those looking at a larger display in this segment.But is it any good? Can Coolpad's new offering make a strong enough case for it to sway buyers away from the obvious choices here?Design and buildThe Mega 2.5D is certainly an attractive looking phone in its gold avatar and we can see Coolpad has paid close attention to the build as well as fit and finish of the chassis. The 2.5D in its name refers to the curved glass on top of the display. This is manufactured by NEG (Nippon Electric Glass) and we can expect a certain amount"
16,coolpad note 3 lite,"The Coolpad Note 3 Lite, as the name suggests, is a toned down version of the Coolpad Note 3 (Review | Pictures) that launched back in October last year. It was one of the first phones in the sub-Rs. 10,000 price segment to sport a fingerprint sensor, and today, the company is bringing this feature available at an even lower price segment. (Also see: Coolpad Note 3 Lite vs Coolpad Note 3)Our initial impressions of the Note 3 Lite were fairly positive but that was after using it for just a short while. Let's see if Coolpad will be able to disrupt the entry-level Android market with its latest offering.Look and feelThe Coolpad Note 3 Lite has all the hallmarks of a budget phone but a few good design choices help it stand out. The gold trim running along the edges of the body, camera lens, and fingerprint sensor jazzes up the phone a bit. The quality of the plastics and the overall fit and finish of the parts is quite good, and the phone feels sturdy and durable on the whole.In the front, we have a 5-inch HD IPS display with scratch protection. The screen has a noticeable thick black border running around it, which detracts from the otherwise sleek edge-to-edge appearance of the display. The capacitive buttons for navigation are responsive, but sadly lack backlight"
17,gionee a1 plus,"Gionee launched its A series in India earlier this year, and theGionee A1(Review) was aimed at the youth of the nation. At launch, Gionee stated that devices in this series will focus on better selfies and good battery life. We now see a new model calledGionee A1 Plus. Gionee had announced both the A1 and the A1 Plus at MWC in March earlier this year. While the A1 was quick to launch in India, the A1 Plus arrived only last month.As its name suggests, the A1 Plus is bigger than the A1. It packs in a bigger battery and sports dual cameras on the back. The internals seem to have gotten a bump as well, but does that make it a winner in its price bracket? Keep reading to find out.Gionee A1 Plus designThe first thing that struck us about the Gionee A1 Plus was its sheer size. This is a big phone and it feels bulky as well. The 6-inch display means that the A1 Plus is tough to hold in one hand at times. The fingerprint sensor is positioned on the front and is flanked by capacitive touch buttons. You can swap what the capacitive buttons do but they arent backlit which make them hardto find in the dark.This phone tips the scale at 226 grams and"
18,google pixel 2 xl,"Googles Nexus devices gaveAndroid fans the experience of a stock UI, at a time when manufacturers and carriers were forcing heavy custom skins and bloatware onto the devices they sold.The Nexusphones found their share of fans bystriking a good balance between price and performance.With a loyal user base already in place, Google decided to try playing in the big leagues with the Pixel series last year. The philosophy of providing the best Android experience remained, but the emphasis was more on premium features and performance than affordability.Compromises that had been made previously were abandoned, and most notably, the originalPixel and Pixel XL had arguably the best cameras of their generation. This direction continues with the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, though Google is taking slightly different design approaches this time around, which makes for some interesting differences between the two.The Pixel 2 XL is what we have for review today, and it is the larger and prettier of the two. It is priced starting at a steep Rs. 73,000, which puts it right against the Apple iPhone 8 Plus(Review). Of course, it also competes with other flagships includingSamsungs Galaxy Note 8(Review) and LGs V30 (which is yet to launch in India).It's also hard to ignore all the bad press thisphone has received ever since it went on sale. Were going to keep an open mind on"
19,google pixel 3,"For all the Pixel 3's implementations of AI  and there a lot of them  this isn't a phone that asks anything unwelcome of its users. There's no learning curve here, no alphabetized list of features buried in submenus to memorize and no sacrifice required to get the most from the hardware. In a way, the Pixel 3 is the anti-Android phone.Here, Google has built a device that bends to you, not one that forces you to bend. And that makes the Pixel 3 one of the best smartphones available. It's delightfully intuitive and easy to live with, yet infinitely capable. In other words, it's the smartphone that will remind you of the very first time you used a smartphone and all the fascination and promise that came with it.Now that the Pixel 4 is launched, stock of the Pixel 3 is dwindling. Google recently cut the phone's price to $499, though those supplies quickly depleted at the Google Store. That means you'll have to look elsewhere to nab last year's model at a good price.Still, if you can track down a bargain, the Pixel 3 remains a compelling value. If you're looking for a great camera for less money  and you're willing to give up some performance  check out our reviews of the cheaper Pixel 3a ($399/399) and Pixel 3a XL ($479/469).Update Nov."
20,google pixel 4,"The camera may be the Google Pixel 4's headline feature, but there's a lot more on offer with this phone. Especially when compared to the new, but also less impressive, Pixel 5. Whether it's the silky-smooth 90Hz display, super-secure Face-Unlock, and so much more.Unfortunately, as forward thinking as the Pixel 4 may be, Google still repeated a lot of the same frustrating mistakes. Plus, with the Pixel 5 not really having that wow factor, we've had to look forward to see if Google ever has any intention of fixing common Pixel problems like underpowered hardware and weak battery life.The Pixel 4's battery is too small, has a much shorter lifespan you'd expect, and that's why so many people have taken interest in the larger Pixel 4 XL instead. The base storage is also a concern, plus it's quite clear that the screen has a brightness issue. Even if it does look really nice.It's enough to make you want to buy a Pixel 5a instead. While the phone still has the same Snapdragon 765G chipset as the standard Pixel 5, Google managed to solve the battery issues with a phone that clocked in at nine hours and 45 minutes during our testing. And that would only set you back $449.Weak battery life is one foibles that are the most frustrating, because as our Pixel 4 review showed"
21,google pixel 4 xl,"Spend a few minutes with the Google Pixel 4, and you'll quickly realize that while the Pixel phones may be leading Google's charge into hardware, software remains at the heart of these devices.Like the smaller Pixel 4, the Google Pixel 4 XL adds a second rear camera lens, but it's the software-powered computational photography that continues to place Google's devices among the best camera phones. There's a new radar sensor on the front of the phone that recognizes gestures and helps unlock the Pixel 4 XL quickly, but it's working with Google's software to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Even a hardware feature like a display with a faster refresh rate is smart enough to adjust itself dynamically, depending on what it is you're doing.Are all these changes enough to help this phone break through a crowd of Android also-rans to challenge Samsung and Apple?  After conducting my Google Pixel 4 XL review, I came away wishing the display were brighter and that the phone lasted longer on a charge.Those who prefer a cheaper price and smaller display should check out our Google Pixel 4 review. But overall, Google has created one of the best phones, offering an excellent mix of good hardware and intelligent software. The Google Pixel 4 XL starts at $899 and its release date was Oct 24, 2019. That price gets you a phone with a fairly skimpy 64GB of storage. For 128GB,"

The result isnt simply the best cheap phone on the market; its one of the best phones, period, even as we get closer to the first anniversary of its release.In fact, after testing the Pixel 4a when it shipped last year, I personally wouldnt hesitate to choose it over the iPhone SE. While the iPhone SE is more powerful and has conveniences like wireless charging and water resistance, Googles midrange offering tops Apples in several other areas, including a larger and brighter OLED display, more modern design and double the storage out of the box. There'a a reason the Pixel 4a topped the iPhone SE for best phone value in our Tom's Guide Awards 2021."

Particularly for U.K. customers where the 5a isn't currently sold.While the basic Pixel 4a was for people who wanted the best camera phone in the cheapest possible device; the Pixel 4a 5G aimed for people who want a competitively-priced camera phone but also 5G connectivity, better performance and a larger display.There are a slew of other mid-range 5G phones which the Google Pixel 4a 5G goes toe-to-toe against  an LG Velvet here, a Galaxy A71 5G there.

But there's no denying that the Pixel 6 is different from any Google phone that's come before it, from the distinctive new look to the Google-designed Tensor processor that now powers the company's flagship handsets. The affordable $599 price is yet another way the Pixel 6 stands out, though you'll pay more through certain carriers.So yes, the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro command your attention.

We found out in our full review.Honor 10 designThe Honor 10 has a 2.5D curved glass back and a highly polished metal mid-frame for rigidity, making it bear some resemblance to the iPhone X (Review). The glossy glass back looks and feels premium but is slippery and gets smudged very easily. Despite having a glass back, there is no wireless charging, which seems like a missed opportunity.The Honor 10 has minimal screen borders and an impressive 86.2 percent screen-to-body ratio.

The company focussed mainly on the budget segment, with good designs and efficient hardware. We also got the Honor Play, a powerful gaming-centric smartphone aimed at budget-conscious buyers. The first smartphone for 2019 from the Chinese manufacturer is the Honor 10 Lite. It is powered by the relatively new Kirin 710 SoC and has a big display with a small dewdrop notch. What is interesting is that the Honor 10 Lite price in India puts it in a hot segment, where multiple manufacturers are already exchanging blows. Can the Honor 10 Lite deliver the knockout punch? We review it to find out.Honor 10 Lite designYou know this is an Honor phone when you first look at its glossy back panel. Honor is known to use this kind of finish on its devices, and the Honor 10 Lite comes in three different glossy colours: Sapphire Blue, Sky Blue, and Midnight Black. We had the Sapphire Blue variant for review, and it reminded us of the Honor 8X(Review) and the Honor 9N(Review).While the back does attract a lot of attention, it also picks up smudges very easily.

Still, braving these odds, Huawei subsidiary Honor recently launched its new Honor 20 series of phones, including the Honor 20 Pro, Honor 20, and Honor 20 Lite.The Honor 20, which we have for review, is a premium phone. It has only slightly downgraded camera hardware and a different design compared to its flagship-grade sibling, the Honor 20 Pro. Barring that, the Honor 20 is a high-end phone that packs a top-of-the-line SoC, quad rear cameras, modern design with a hole-punch front snapper, and the feature-heavy Magic UI 2.1 Android skin.The Honor 20 falls squarely between the OnePlus 7 (Review) and the OnePlus 7 Pro (Review) in terms of pricing.

How well does it perform in day-to-day usage? We find out in our review.Honor 20i designThe Honor 20i has a polycarbonate rear panel which flaunts a gradient design. Honor claims that the finish has been achieved through a 3D photolithography process. We have the phone's Phantom Blue option for review, which is a royal blue shade at the top and gradually fades into a bright purple hue towards the bottom.The Honor 20i also comes in Phantom Red and Midnight Black colour options, but the latter lacks a dual-tone finish and looks more understated.

Naturally, it's targeted at developing markets such as India, and the phones have managed to generate enough buzz and attention to make Honor a significant player in the budget and mid-range smartphone segments in India.The newest product from the Honor stable is the Honor 5X. This mid-range smartphone has a little bit of everything that you might be looking for in a smartphone. With a fingerprint sensor, 4G dual-SIM connectivity and the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 SoC, the Honor 5X has a lot to offer for Rs. 12,999. There's also Huawei's reputation, which got a significant boost after the Chinese company was chosen to manufacture the Google Nexus 6P (Review | Pictures). Does the Honor 5X live up to or even exceed typical mid-range expectations? We find out in our review.Look and feelOne of the Honor 5X's key features is the fact that it has a metal body. The debate as to whether metal or plastic is better for a smartphone will continue to rage on for as long as the Earth revolves around the Sun, but for those of us who prefer having a more durable material, this is obviously a good thing. Having said that, the device's finish looks and feels more like plastic than metal. The"

Honor has produced some notable smartphones in the past year, of which, the Honor 8 (Review) is one example.The Honor 6X is yet another metal-clad smartphone vying for attention in a very crowded segment. It boasts of dual rear camerasand is powered by Huaweis custom silicon under the hood. It will compete against heavyweights like the Moto G4 Plus(Review) and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4(Review), both of which have proven to be solid performers. Lets see if Honors new offering manages to deliver as good an experience, if not better.Honor 6X design and buildWeve been using the Honor 6X for the better part of a month now and so far, our impressions of the build and finish have stayed pretty much consistent with when we first got our hands on it. The metal chassis has a satin-like finish which feels really good when you hold it. On the flip side, it does make it tricky to grip this phone, and it can easily slideout of your hand. The gentle curves around the sides don't help much with grip either, although aesthetically, this phone looks very good.The 5.5-inch display on the Honor 6X"

The Honor brand allows the company to compete in the crowded budget market, and offer high-quality, well-specified devices at affordable prices without affecting the 'premium' brand image that Huawei has built for itself in China and the world over.That is exactly what the new Honor 7 brings to the table. It's packed to the brim with features, and has top-spec hardware. With a specifications sheet that could put most flagship devices to shame, the Honor 7 hopes to win over a lot of high-value buyers with its Rs. 22,999 price tag. We go into the details in our review.Look and feelWith a 5.2-inch full-HD IPS-LCD screen, the Honor 7 sits in the flagship smartphone sweet spot for displays. It's bright, detailed and suitably large, without breaching the 5.5-inch mark that is arguably considered to be the point where a phone becomes a phablet. The front is 72.4 percent screen, with on-screen soft keys, narrow borders and the front camera and flash on either side of the earpiece.

But, overall, the Honor 7x is a very good bargain.There's only one model for U.S. buyers  a unit with 32GB of storage and 3GB of RAM  and the phone comes in either blue or black. Amazon sells the Honor 7x now. The Honor 7X is an unlocked device, though it's compatible with only GSM networks, such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket and MetroPCS.Clad in stealthy matte aluminum, the Honor 7X follows and improves on the aesthetics of its predecessor. The device sports curved edges and sloping 2.5D glass, to make for a seamless contour from the face to the back. It's certainly premium-feeling for the price, if a little unoriginal. It's no longer uncommon to see even sub-$200 handsets employ metal over plastic, so as much as I appreciate Honor's reluctance to cheap out on materials, the novelty has worn off a bit.However, the Honor 7X has one advantage you'll struggle to find at this price: it"

It was a well-crafted phone with good performance across the board, except in the battery department.A year later, the company has launched a successor called the Honor 8. Unlike its predecessor though, the new model is positioned in the upper mid-range smartphone segment, which puts it in the crosshairs of the OnePlus 3 (Review) and the Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE553KL) (Review), both of which have proven to be excellent choices.The OnePlus 3 has been our de facto recommendation around this price segment for a while now, but can the Honor 8 change that? More than ticking specifications boxes, does it offer the kind of good experience which has earned the other two such high praise?Honor 8 design and buildHonor has overhauled its design completely, and the new model looks striking. There are elements of Samsungs 2016 A-series aesthetic here with a metal frame sandwiched between two sheets of curved glass.

The Honor 8 Pro sports dual rear cameras and is priced to go up against the new kid on the block, the OnePlus 5 (Review). So does this phone have what it takes to dethrone one of the most popular models around? Lets find out in our Honor 8 Pro review.Honor 8 Pro designThe design of the Honor 8 Pro is slightly different when compared to its sibling, the Honor 8. The older model has a glossy glass back, whereas the Honor 8 Pro gets a metal unibody. It's available in two colours, Midnight Black and Navy Blue, and youll be happy with either one. The smartphone is quite sleek, measuring just 6.97mm in thickness, and has curved sides. What is surprising is that Honor has managed to cram a 4000mAh battery into this body.At the front, there's a 5.7-inch LTPS panel, with super-slim side borders. The top and bottom are thicker, and there's an Honor logo below the screen."

Let's see if the Honor 8C can compete with such heavy hitters.Honor 8C designThe body of the Honor 8C is all plastic and the build quality is satisfactory, but this smartphone does not feel as premium as its glass- and metal-backed rivals.

The new Honor 8X is aimed at the competitiveRs. 15,000 price segment, where the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) has been quite popular for quite some time.But that's not the only smartphone that the Honor 8X is up against. There are other great options such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power (Review), and the Realme 2 Pro (Review). So, does Honor's latest launch deliver enough performance and featuers to take on the might of these heavy hitters, all of which have received positive reviews from us? We put the Honor 8X to the test.Honor 8X designOne of the marquee features of the Honor 8X is its design, something that differentiates it from the others in its price segment. It boasts of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, especially for a phone that starts at just Rs. 14,999. Honor calls this a visual grating effect and says it has used multiple layers of glass to achieve it.However, the glossy back on the Honor"

This isnt the companys first attempt at a quad-camera smartphone -we first saw it attempt to wow buyers with the Honor 9i(Review). However, the company is now taking this feature a bit more mainstream as the 9 Lite enters the market priced at just Rs. 10,999. The 9 Lite doesn't rely solely on its cameras; it also seems to check all the right boxes in terms of specifications. Our first impressions of it were fairly positive,and its now time to see if the Honor 9 Lite can indeed raise the bar in the budget segment.Honor 9 Lite design and build qualityThe Honor 9 Lite reminds us a lot of the Honor 8(Review), which was the companys flagship in 2016.

The screen isnt the only interesting thing about this new phone. It also sports four cameras making it quite unique. While the specifications look good on paper, do they translate into a good real-world experience? We've got the answer.Honor 9i designIf you have been tempted by phones with huge displays and thin bezels, the Honor 9i will pique your interest. It packs a huge 5.9-inch display with slim borders all around. Dont let the screen size put you off, since the 18:9 aspect ratio means that the phone overall is roughly the same size as most current 5.5-inch phones. The big display means that the metal earpiece, sensors, and front cameras have been pushed right to the upper edge.

It's just as well, as some of the 9Xs other specs simply dont match those of rival budget phones.  Despite some missing features, the Honor 9X is a a solid  phablet for someone who isnt concerned about the latest and greatest from fancier phones.In the UK, the single 4GB RAM and 128GB storage model costs 249, and has been in sale from Nov. 13.

It seemed obvious that HTC was waiting for a supply of Qualcomm's hot new Snapdragon 835 processor, and so we advised anyone interested in the HTC U Ultra for its looks to hang on for a little while before spending Rs. 60,000. As it turns out, we were exactly right. The HTC U11 is already hereand not only is it a lot more powerful than the U Ultra,but italso costs less.With a launch price of Rs. 51,990, the HTC U11 is significantly more appealing than the U Ultra was at Rs. 59,990. It's also got HTC's brand new ""squeezable"" Edge Sense feature to set it apart. One big thing that the U11 lacks compared to the U Ultra is its secondary screen. However, this makes it slightly smaller, which a lot of people would, in fact, consider a good thing.

HTC created a beautiful device with the U12+, which is almost better than it has any right to be.But absolutely awful pressure-sensitive buttons and lackluster battery life prevent this phone from being a must-buy, and without carrier retail availability, the U12+ probably wont threaten Samsungs Galaxy S9.The U12+ is available to unlocked in the U.S. on HTC's website and Amazon. A 64GB version comes in Translucent Blue and Ceramic Black for $799, and a 128GB option in Translucent Blue is $849.The phone is compatible with AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon's networks, but will not be available to buy through a carrier.As every smartphone maker under the sun follows the notch design trend set by Apple's iPhone X, it's refreshing to see a flagship phone in 2018 that goes its own way. What's troubling is how the buttons feel (hint: not like buttons at all).HTC's new flagship eschews a notch at the top of its screen in favor of slim bezels surrounding its Gorilla Glass-coated display. The screen's forehead houses the phone's earpiece and two front-facing cameras for face unlocking and portrait selfies. The chin is a little thick, given that it's unused by even a logo, but"

The P20 Pro was a camera king, making use of Leica-branded lenses.Alongside the Google Pixel 3, the P20 Pro remains the camera phone to beat  and that's exactly what Huawei hopes to do with the new Huawei Mate 20 Pro. And, boy, does it have fun trying  complete with a design that puts Samsung on notice, an in-display fingerprint sensor and a battery so big that youll have enough juice left over to wirelessly charge other phones.The news that the Mate 20 Pro won't be sold in the US is utterly disappointing.

The cameras, display and design have all undergone significant changes for the Mate 30 Pro, accompanied by new software features and hardware that round off the upgrade. But while the engineering may be innovative, there are good reasons to steer clear of this smartphone. First, Huawei's continuing problems with the U.S. government have given the Mate 30 the dubious honor of being barred from using Google apps. Second, as with recent Huawei phones, U.S. users will not be able to buy the Mate 30, although Huawei will likely sell the phone in the U.K. at a later date. These obstacles, plus a few smaller issues with the handset, are not unbeatable. But why bother when there are already fully functional Android phones that more readily available? You'll need to be truly in love with the Mate 30 Pro's hardware to pick this over a Galaxy Note 10 Plus or Google Pixel 4 XL.Editors' Note: We are reviewing a Chinese 4G version of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, which may differ from final 4G version or 5G version, both of which are expected to launch in Europe in the coming months.Huawei hasn't revealed release dates or prices yet.

The Huawei P20 Lite is one of the two new smartphones launched by the Chinese giant in India, the other being the P20 Pro(Review). Despite sharing the P20, the Lite has little in common with the Pro, though it features a glass-and-metal body, dual rear cameras, a 19:9 display, and runsAndroid 8.0 Oreo out of the box.Priced at Rs. 19,999, the Huawei P20 Lite aims to take on the likes of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, Oppo F7, and Honor 9i. Is Huawei's smartphone a 'notch' above the competition? Let's find out in our full review.Huawei P20 Lite designThe Huawei P20 Lite has a glass back and an aluminium frame for rigidity. The smartphone has a very sleek and clean design with no antenna lines at the back, smartly integrated dual cameras, and minimal screen borders up front. Thanks to the 80.55 percent screen-to-body ratio, the P20 Lite is quite compact and pocketable.

The P20 Pro won't even be offered in the United States, but the phone has still captivated worldwide interest, precisely for its quirks.It's a far cry from Huaweis last high-end handset, the Mate 10 Pro  which strangely enough is sold here, but has struggled to get noticed by American consumers, due to a combination of geopolitical distrust and a lack of truly distinctive features.But standing out isn't a problem for the P20 Pro. Unlike the Mate line, which Huawei aims squarely at business types, Huawei's P-series flagships are designed for creatives. And that focus shows: the P20 Pro is more fun: to look at, to show off to your friends and to use  especially when snapping memories of a night on the town.The P20 Pro isn't perfect, but it is a step forward for the globe's No. 3 smartphone maker, and the device it should have relied upon to boost its U.S. profile.Update (Aug. 31): Huawei has introduced new colors and configurations for the P20 and P20 Pro.

For every iPhone XS or Galaxy S10, we get an iPhone XR or S10e that trades some features for a more affordable price.Enter the Huawei P30, a slightly stripped-back version of the excellent P30 Pro. The P30 loses few of the headlining pieces of tech found in the Pro model in exchange for a /$200 or so price cut. Many of the good things about the P30 Pro are still present on the P30, making it easy to recommend the lower-cost model. If you can control your feelings of jealousy toward P30 Pro owners, you'll likely be pleased to have the Huawei P30 in your pocket.In the U.K., you can buy the P30 from a few places, including Carphone Warehouse, EE, Three and O2. But the best deal is from Amazon UK, which sells the model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage that I tested for this review for 599. Thats 100 less than the P30's list price.

The Huawei P30 Lite borrows design elements from the Huawei P30 Pro and offers competent hardware, at least on paper, at a starting price of Rs. 19,990. At the Huawei P30 series' launch event in India, we had a brief hands-on experience with the Huawei P30 Lite, and here's what we think about the Chinese smartphone maker's latest mid-range offering.The Huawei P30 Lite, despite being a budget-friendly smartphone that costs less than one-third of the Huawei P30 Pro's asking price, doesn't skimp on the flashiness and still looks gorgeous. The gradient finish on the Peacock Blue variant exhibits wavy patterns and catches the eye when light falls on it at different angles. There is also another variant called Midnight Black, which sports an understated glossy black finish.In addition to aesthetics, the Huawei P30 Lite also offers a nice in-hand feel with a decent grip thanks to the curved 3D glass exterior.

For the third year in a row now, the Chinese giant is aiming to outdo Apple, Samsung, and other players in the high-end smartphone space specifically in terms of camera quality and features. After experimenting with unique sensors, lenses and software features with the Huawei P10 and P20 families, we now have with us the brand new Huawei P30 Pro, the flagship of the new P30 lineup. The defining feature of this phone is its 5X optical zoom capability, which beats everything else on the market by a huge margin, and shows that Huawei's R&D and manufacturing capabilities are among the best in the world.What's even better is that the cleverly engineered zoom lens isn't the only impressive thing about this phone's cameras or about its features overall. With an asking price in India of Rs. 71,990, the new Huawei P30 Pro has practically every feature and capability that you could think of having in a smartphone today. It will go right up against the iPhone XS Max (Review), Samsung Galaxy S10+ (Review), and Google Pixel 3 XL (Review)  not to mention Huawei's own Mate 20 Pro (Review).

Many times, taking the risk pays off, and were better people for it.Its an analogy that fits the Huawei P40 Pro. Buying it means cutting off your ties with Google and trying something different.Ive spent several weeks with the Huawei P40 Pro. Heres what happened when I took the risk.This phone is beautiful. Having spent the last weeks juggling the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus, the OnePlus 8 Pro, and various other modern smartphones, the Huawei P40 Pro stands above them all in terms of spot-on styling, a clear identity, and sensibly made design choices.The greatest is the choice of frosted, matte-finish glass on the back. Yes, the OnePlus 8 has something like it, as does the Xiaomi Mi 10 Pro, but they dont look as fabulous as the P40 Pro.My favorite part? The way the Huawei logo reflects deep into the glass. The curved sides of the body catch the light, and the frosted silver color seen here morphs between blue, gray, white, and silver.The elegance is blighted by the monster camera bump, which gives the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra a run for its money in the its how big? stakes.

That ban hit the Huawei Mate 30 Pro particularly hard, as last falls release fell flat.The P40 series  and specifically the P40 Pro  has had more time to adapt to a life without the Google Play Store, and Huawei has had the chance to improve on last years features. The result is once again a phone that could crush the competition when it comes to photography, but will cause headaches in the software department. Our hands-on Huawei P40 Pro review demontrates that Huawei has closed the gap with the Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus and the iPhone 11 Pro. If you want the best hardware at any cost, you'll want the P40 Pro. But if you value convenience, you should still look elsewhere.The Huawei P40 Pro, with its single 8GB RAM/256GB storage version will cost 999 euros ($1,095/912 converted), and will be available to buy from April 7.

This has now changed, with the launch of the new Huawei P9.Priced at Rs. 39,999, the Huawei P9 is a flagship phone with a bit more to offer than most in terms of camera performance. It features dual 12-megapixel primary cameras co-engineered with German optics maker Leica.

That's not because I've ignored Apple's latest iOS update  I installed it the first day the public beta became available on the iPhone I use as my every-day mobile device. Instead, I haven't thought that much about iOS 12, because the new OS has performed pretty well for me these last three months, with its major enhancements fitting nicely into my daily workflow.That's an important thing to keep in mind, now that iOS is ready for anyone with a compatible iPhone or iPad to download. iOS 12 isn't an exactly a ground-breaking update for a mobile OS, but it's not a phone-breaking update, either, and I think the latter was more of Apple's goal this time out.iPhone owners don't face the same waiting game that you have to play with an Android device, where your phone might not get a major OS update until long after Google releases. If you have an iPhone that's capable of running of a new iOS version, you can download it the very day Apple makes the update available.In the case of iOS 12, that's a lot of devices.

The cameras are very good, thanks to an ultra-wide lens and a Night mode for better low-light performance.As you'll see in our full iPhone 11 review, Apple upped the ante with greater video-recording quality while also delivering superb battery life. At $799, the iPhone 12 is a great option with its 5G support and an even faster A14.

The industry is at a point where there isn't much more that a smartphone can do  our personal devices already handle text and video communication, music, movies, games, Web browsing, news, social networking, banking, health tracking, smart device management, and even the occasional phone call. We haven't seen any significant new functionality or any new use case that demands a leap in performance. Foldables aren't really taking off, VR has limited appeal, and although 5G is faster and better, it isn't yet changing usage habits.So it's no surprise that upgrade cycles have lengthened and attention has shifted to lower price segments, which are benefiting from trickle-down feature improvements. Even Apple is taking a year off from significant overhauls, instead delivering subtle refinements and quality bumps in key areas with the iPhone 13 family. While the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max(Review)are the new top-end flagships that you'd buy if you want the absolute latest and best, the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini are aimed at mainstream buyers who want a brand new model, but don't need advanced camera capabilities or don't want to spend quite so much.The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini are very similar to the iPhone 12(Review)and iPhone 12 mini(Review) from last year.

If you glance through their spec sheets, these are the two key hardware specifications that set this year's iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max apart from their predecessors, and neither one of them is pathbreaking. In fact, both these features have been common on sub-Rs. 20,000 Android phones for quite a while now. So what is it exactly that justifies spending well over Rs. 1,00,000 on either of these two new iPhones?The answer to that is a bit abstract, and potentially frustrating  you pay for the overall experience that only Apple has so far managed to achieve. These aren't necessarily things that get listed on spec sheets; they're capabilities that arise from tight integration between the hardware, software, services, design, and manufacturing process.

The anticipation for the tenth anniversary iPhone started last year, well before the usual time for the iPhone rumour mill to start whirring. While the launch itself may have been without too many surprises - thanks to the generous number of leaks, the biggest from Apple itself - that didnt stop the iPhone X from grabbing everyones attention, not least because it made Rs. 1 lakh phones a reality.The iPhone has never been about specifications, and thats never been more true than with the iPhone X, which shares most of its internals with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, but is nothing like any other iPhone - new or old - in terms of design or how you interact with it on an everyday basis. With Face ID and a UI paradigm reimagined without the Home button, Apple says the iPhone X is the future of the smartphone.The first time we saw the iPhone X from the back, it reminded us of older iPhone models, specifically the pronounced rounded corners and general chunkiness of the iPhone 3GS. No, the iPhone X is nowhere near as thick as the iPhone 3GS - thankfully - but at 174g, its a fair bit heavier than any iPhone model to date that hasnt carried the Plus moniker.

You get a roomy 6.1-inch display, swift performance from Apple's A12 Bionic processor and good camera quality in a colorful design. Most important, the price is a very reasonable $499.There are some features you don't get here with the iPhone XR, such as a Night mode for the camera, 5G or an OLED display. If you can handle a smaller phone, the 4.7-inch iPhone SE is even cheaper while offering a faster processor. But based on my iPhone XR review, Apple's big-screen phone is worth buying for those on a budget.Some may want to wait for the iPhone 13 to see what Apple has to offer this fall, but those phones will likely have a much more premium price. The iPhone XR gives you pretty much everything you could want in an affordable phone with minimal trade-offs. The iPhone XR went on sale Oct. 26, 2018.

This smartphone a perfectly sized screen thats usable with one hand, on top of meaningful performance and camera upgrades  all of which makes it the best iPhone yet.The iPhone XS is almost indistinguishable from an iPhone X. We say nearly, because there are a few tells. If its in gold, then its the iPhone XS. The new color adds an elegant shine to the edges of the phone, though the rear looks paler  almost pinkish. The back can also slightly change color in different lighting, which is a nice touch.At the very bottom, youll notice Apple has cut the number of holes on the left edge of the phone from six to three.

The Chinese company has been one of the few companies that has been launching 4G-enabled smartphones in India for a long time.In 2015, the company claimed it had a 30 percent share of the 4G smartphone market in the country. Lenovo's dominance however has been challenged by other vendors, even as the market grows thanks to Reliance Jio's 4G network and other telcos making big investments in 4G as well. Lenovo has been dealing with solid competition from other Chinese counterparts including Xiaomi, which has for the first time made it into the top five in India.The recently unveiled Lenovo K6 Power tries to further strengthen the company's portfolio in the sub-Rs. 10,000 price segment. The company already offered a slew of models in this segment including the Lenovo Vibe K5 (Review), Lenovo Vibe K5 Plus (Review), and the now-dated Lenovo Vibe K4 Note (Review). The new Lenovo K6 Power features an all-metal body and comes with a fingerprint scanner.

91,lg g4,"As smartphones have evolved, it has become increasingly difficult for companies to sufficiently differentiate their products from the competition. One company that has managed to do this - with varied degrees of success - is LG, whose flagship products have been following a design language that's very much their own.With the G Flex, LG really pushed the boundaries in terms of design by moving physical buttons to the back. While the'self-healing' phone may not have been a commercial success (at least in India), LG felt encouraged enough to retain the design template in subsequent phones like the G Pro 2 and last year's flagship, the LG G3. The LG G4 aims to build on the success of last year's flagship, which managed to carve a following of its own thanks to some unique elements. So is the G4 a step in the right direction? Let's find out.(Also see: LG G4 vs. LG G3)Design and displayThe LG G4 takes most of its design cues from its predecessor. Buttonless sides were undoubtedly the most distinctive feature of the G3, and LG's new flagship continues this tradition.

92,lg g6,"It's hard not to feel just a little bad for the LG G6, going up against the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+(Review). There was a brief window of time following the G6's launch announcement at MWC 2017 when it did get a bit of attention, but even then, everyone was more focused on Galaxy S8 leaks and Samsung's decision to launch later with a more powerful processor. LG was able to pull off an early launch because it decided to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821from last year instead of waiting for the delayed Snapdragon 835 - a very interesting move.However, it means that LG knows the G6 can't compete toe-to-toe with the flagships releasing over the next few weeks and months. Instead, it has to rely on its visual appeal, cameras, software,durability, and the idea that it can deliver a unique overall experience. Let's see what LG brings to the table, and how the G6 stacks up against its current and near-future competition.LG G6 designThe first thing you'll notice about the LG G6 is that it's quite chunky. It isn't actually all that big compared to current-day phones with 5.5-inch screens, especially the iPhone 7 Plus(Review), but it feels thick and bulky. That might be because of the dated styling, with flat sides and"
93,lg g7+ thinq,"LGs smartphone endeavours havent quite hit the same stride as its Korean rival Samsung in recent times. Globally, LG still has a big portfolio of smartphones, but of late, India seems to be getting fewer launches. Take for instance its flagship for 2018, the G7 ThinkQ. LG launched this model just before Google I/O this year, where it partnered with the search giant to launch the first Android phone with a dedicated hardware button for Google Assistant.Three months in, and LG has quietly snuck the G7+ ThinQ into India without any fanfare, which is really odd considering its aggressive price of Rs. 39,990. This puts it smack against the 8GB version of the OnePlus 6(Review), and on paper, it appears to offers even better specifications. The OnePlus 6 has been our solid recommendation so far at around this price, although weve always felt that features like wireless charging and proper waterproofing would have complemented the package nicely.

The G8 actually makes me mad: It has a beautiful display, powerful performance and AI-boosted cameras that get the job done. A new Night View mode impressed me more than a similar feature on Googles Pixel 3. It's definitely better than last year's G7 ThinQ. But by putting novelty ahead of function, the G8 sabotages itself, which is why it doesn't make our list of best phones.Cheat Sheet: What's new in the LG G8 ThinQ?Price and AvailabilityThe G8 ThinQ goes on sale April 11, beginning first with Verizon, and then rolling out a day later on AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint.

We've liked a lot of what we've seen, and these phones have impressed us with their cameras, displays, and overall performance. More importantly, LG seems to put a lot of thought into its products, with various little features and conveniences that stand out in an increasingly homogenous world.The new LG G8s ThinQ has arrived in the Indian market quite a bit later than we would have expected for a 2019 flagship device, and so it doesn't win any firsts in terms of specifications. Is this phone good enough to win over buyers who are looking at the current value flagships from OnePlus, Xiaomi, and others, or even more premium models from Samsung and Apple? We're about to find out.LG G8s ThinQ designLG isn't breaking any new ground with the design of the G8s ThinQ. In fact, it could almost be considered dated, with relatively chunky screen borders and an enormous wide notch. Most other manufacturers have already evolved to sleeker designs. One thing that jumps out immediately is the off-centre earpiece. This was probably necessary in order to accommodate a larger"

The South Korean company is now trying to make a mark with its own take on a foldable smartphone, with the LG G8X ThinQ. This new device can work like an ordinary smartphone, but also lets you double your screen space with an add-on display case that is bundled in the box. The G8X ThinQ is priced at Rs. 49,999 in India, including the display case, and this is the first time such a product had made it to our market. Is it useful or just a gimmick?

Despite it being a very good smartphone, the company hasfailed to translate that into good sales. In addition to the premium tier, LG hasnt had any breakout hits with its budget or mainstream offerings either. Now, with its new Q series, LG is hoping to attack the mainstream market with features trickled down from the G6. The big highlight of its first offering is the taller FullVision display.LG launched three variants of the Q6 with different amounts of RAM in early July, andIndia has received the Q6 with 3GB of RAM. The smartphone is priced very attractively under Rs. 15,000, which LG hopeswill attract value-conscious buyers who want to stand out. However, can the display alone be enough to make the Q6 a hit? Lets find out.LG Q6 design and build qualityThe LG Q6 is definitely one of the most comfortable 5.5-inch smartphones weve used recently, thanks to its extremely slim screen borders.

In just the past three years, this company has famously put buttons on the back of its devices, launched a series of flexible convex phones, and created a standard for modular accessories. Now, LG is trying to popularise the idea of a second screen. Following the last years LG V10 and this years mid-range X Screen(Review), LG is shooting for flagship status with the new V20.We liked the LG X Screen but found that everything other than its secondary display was too underpowered. The V20 might fix that problem, but it might also go too far in the opposite direction. Does LG need another flagship phone in 2016, and does the V20 genuinely bring anything useful to the table?LG V20 look and feelLarge phones are the norm these days, and the V20 fits right into that mould. It has a 5.7-inch primary screen, but theres also a strip above that for the secondary screen and another below for symmetry. While LG has tried to reduce space around it, the phone is still pretty chunky.

99,lg v30+,"LG is a perennial underdog in the smartphone industry, constantly overshadowed by Samsung and others. To its credit, the company knows this, and keeps trying new approaches that might appeal to niche audiences - things that capitalise on its in-house expertise and that no other company is doing. That's how we got the gloriously impractical G Flex(Review), the V-series with dual screens, and last year's modular G5(Review). LG also hopes that features such as high-quality audio playback and recording will attract buyers who really value that kind of thing above all else. Unfortunately, most of its devices have rough edges, and haven't been priced competitively.When it comes to flagships, LG has had a split strategy for the past few years. Its G-series phones, usually launched around March, are more typical flagships, while the V-series models launched towards the end of the year are more experimental and offbeat. Last year's V20(Review) had a secondary screen, dual cameras, reinforced aluminium body and high-end audio. We didn't mind having any of those features, but they didn't exactly make us want to run out and buy it either.This year there's a new strategy at play. The main features of the LG V30+ are its top-end hardware and focus on design - in fact, this might be the best looking phone"

We're betting on cameras  specifically, the number of cameras arranged on the front and rear of a phone. The days of single lenses are over, but LG's new V40 ThinQ ($920 to $980) proves five shooters may be overkill.LG's V-series lineup is where the company tends to introduce features designed for serious content producers. The V40 continues that trend with three rear and two front cameras, with a slew of novelty photography features designed to get the most out of all those lenses.But in our testing, five cameras didn't necessarily deliver more amazing results than three lenses  or even two, for that matter.LG says that pre-orders for the V40 ThinQ start as early as today (Oct. 3) in some locations, though most carriers we've talked to seem to be starting pre-orders next week. The phone goes on sale beginning Oct. 18. T-Mobile is offering the phone for $920 ($30 a month over 24 months with a down payment of $200), Sprint for $960 (or $20 a month on an 18-month lease for qualifying users), Verizon for $980 (or $40.83 a month over 24 months) and AT&T for $950 (or $31.67 a month"

Its fun to watch a nearly 2GB game download in 25 seconds, but the next-gen network technology is not worth the price of admission. Yet.The LG V50 ThinQ doesnt change that. It doesnt offer much new over last years LG V40 ThinQ, which makes it dull, and the competition offers better features for less. Its the first phone from LG to support 5G, which is why its $1,152 price (on Sprint) is so high. Thats why you should skip it.Ok. Lets talk 5G.The V50 ThinQ is a 5G phone, but its only available through Sprint and Verizon right now. Theres no unlocked version. Its also not interoperable, so if you buy the V50 ThinQ from Sprint, it will not work on Verizons 5G network (and vice versa). Thats because Sprints V50 utilizes mid-band spectrum while Verizons model opts for millimeter wave (mmWave).

102,lg v60 thinq 5g,"It goes that if something isn't broke, you don't fix it. Evidently, LG feels that way about its flagship smartphones. The Korean tech giant has taken a very iterative approach with its premium mobile line over the last two years and change, and that philosophy has flowed into its latest offering: the LG V60 ThinQ 5G.Mind you, iteration isn't necessarily a bad thing, and our LG V60 ThinQ 5G review found that this phone isn't entirely the worse for it. This is a very complete handset  arguably more complete than even the Samsung Galaxy S20, given that LG appears to be one of the few phone makers left that's committed to the headphone jack. The V60's battery life also marks a satisfying step forward for LG, whose devices always seemed to lag behind the competition's in endurance.Nevertheless, LG's continued emphasis on evolution, rather than revolution, has produced yet another flagship that feels like a refresh of a rehash rather than a candidate for one of the best phones you can buy right now. And while other phone makers are innovating with camera hardware, fast-refreshing displays and exotic materials, LG seems quite comfortable immersed in the status quo. Sure, the V60 is good enough, and its battery life lands it firmly on our list of the longest-lasting phones. But this phone offers nothing we haven't seen before"

Launching a new product in this segment today is risky as not only does it need to match the expectations that's been set but it should have something unique enough to make a mark.LG aims to capture a sliver of this market with its newly introduced X screen smartphone, which boasts of a second 'ticker-styled' display similar to what we first saw on LG's premium V10 smartphone last year.Design and buildThe 1.7-inch secondary colour LCD display (80x520 pixel resolution) stays on all the time, even when the phone is off, so you can view your notifications without having to turn on the main display.

The front is made of Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection against scratches. The rest of the phone isn't too exciting to look at and won't be turning heads.

For that amount, you get 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a fingerprint sensor, which not many manufacturers offer. It also has some throwback features such as a removable battery, which we don't see much these days. Armed with a modern design and decent all-round specifications, should the Moto 6Es be your top budget pick? It's time to review and find out.Moto E6s designThe design of the Moto E6s is pretty simple and basic. The display gets a notch on the top and pretty thick borders all around, especially the chin, which is not unusual to see on budget smartphones. The volume rocker and power button are on the right side. The buttons don't have a lot of travel but they are easy to press.

Things have changed a little though since Motorola has done away with numbering its smartphones in the usual ascending order. Now, the new G series has two new models, the Moto G10 Power and Moto G30. So has Motorola retained its charm? I got my hands on the Moto G30 and here are my first impressions.The Moto G30 is positioned higher than the Moto G10 Power and is priced at Rs 10,999 in India. This smartphone is well designed and looks like it can withstand daily use quite well. It sports a 6.5-inch display with a 20:9 aspect ratio and a dewdrop notch at the top. The aspect ratio makes the phone tall and narrow. Holding it in one hand isn't much of an issue but I found it difficult to reach the top of the display. You get an HD+ resolution which is acceptable, but it also has a 90Hz refresh rate. The dewdrop notch feels like a step in the wrong direction since the Moto G9 Power had a hole-punch display. You get thin bezels on the Moto G30 but the bottom chin is relatively thick. A thin earpiece sits between the frame and the 13-megapixel camera"

Both promise new features and upgrades that will help Moto stay competitive. The company has been on a launch spree this calendar year, bringing new Moto E, Moto C, and Moto Z devices to the Indian market, plus the Moto X4 internationally. The reason for the rapid refresh of the G series, according to Lenovo, is that the Rs. 15,000 and above segment is seeing a steady rise in demand, and there has been a change in consumer spending. Will this strategy work this time around for Lenovo? Let's try to find out.Moto G5S Plus and Moto G5S designFor Lenovo, Moto G devices are more about providing value for money rather than promising top-notch specifications at dirt cheap prices.

The result is still another great choice among midrange rivals, but one that hardly pushes any boundaries for the segment.Price and AvailabilityThe Moto G6 costs $249 both unlocked and through carriers, including Verizon (where it's actually a bit cheaper, at $240) and prepaid services like Republic Wireless. For that price, you'll get 32GB of storage paired with 3GB of RAM. A microSD slot lets you expand space for additional apps and media, but the phone won't accept anything beyond a 128GB card.The Moto G6 comes in three colors  Black, Deep Indigo and Blush  and works on both GSM and CDMA networks.

The highly polished metal midframe and circular rear camera module have been carried over from the Moto G6, but the glass on the back has been replaced by what Motorola calls 'polymer glass'. Marketing-speak aside, the back panel is made of plastic with a high-gloss finish that's trying to imitate glass. It does not feel as premium, but is claimed to be less prone to breakage.

That's alarming at first glance, but only until you recognize the lengths to which Motorola goes to justify the added expense.From its surprising performance to its stunning display and premium software, the Moto G7 packs value that's rare to find, even at that higher price. It's not quite the midrange alternative it once was, but the Moto G7 is still one of the best phones you can get for the money.The $299 Moto G7 is the most well-equipped model in a family of three phones that also includes the $249 Moto G7 Power and $199 Moto G7 Play.

However, Motorola has confirmed it won't be releasing a more powerful Force variant of the Z4, as it has with previous entries to the Z lineup. That means the Z4  with its humble Snapdragon 675 chipset  is the range-topping Motorola device for 2019, at least in North America where the company's Motorola One line isn't available.In fairness, though, the Moto Z4 can do things other phones can't. It supports the full range of Moto Mods, so it can work on Verizon's 5G network with the help of the 5G Mod.

Motorola One Vision is the latest phone from the company and it aims to be more premium than the bread-and-butter Moto G-series. This new model ups the ante with a more modern design and upgraded camera hardware, while still retaining a competitive price.The phone's hole-punch camera is a feature that is still usually seen only on high-end phones, while the 21:9 display is being touted as multimedia-friendly.

You'd have to spend hundreds more on a flagship from OnePlus or Samsung to get a phone with both ultrawide and telephoto shooters like the Motorola One Zoom has. However, the Zoom's versatility doesn't necessarily translate to great images in every scenario. The result is a decently well-rounded midrange contender, albeit one that doesn't quite find a home among the best camera phones or the best smartphones overall.The Motorola One Zoom costs $449 and is sold unlocked from Motorola and Amazon. The phone works on only GSM-based carriers, like T-Mobile, AT&T, Metro and Cricket  meaning those who belong to CDMA networks, like Verizon and Sprint, are out of luck here.There's only one configuration of the Motorola One Zoom, and it comes with 128GB of storage and 4GB of RAM.

These smartphones offer decent performance and features considering their low prices. The Infinix Smart 3 Plus, for example, is one of the few phones to sport a triple camera setup with a dedicated low-light camera sensor. HMD Global seems to be eyeing a spot for itself in the sub-Rs. 8,000 segment, and has launched the Nokia 2.2 for this reason. Is this smartphone capable of pulling it off, or will it fall short?

This budget-friendly model is priced at Rs. 11,999 in India. It hasa more modest Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 processor and a smaller 4,000mAh battery, which might put it at a disadvantage compared to others at this price level, but what it has going for it is the promise of guaranteed software updates, which is rare.

That question has gotten harder and harder to answer in recent years, as handset prices have continually risen.Fortunately, HMD Global isn't blindly following trends with its introduction of the 5.7-inch Nokia 4.2. At $189, I'd venture a guess and say it's below most people's threshold of what constitutes cheap  especially as some low-cost rivals, like Moto's G7 series, have crossed the $300 barrier.And yet, for how little you're paying for the Nokia 4.1, you still get minimal bezels; dual cameras at the rear packed with special effects to add a bit of pop to photos; a reasonably priced, 3,000-mAh battery; and pure, up-to-date Android One software, as Google intended.The Nokia 4.2 is a respectable, cheap phone  nothing more, nothing less.

I like the big 6.55-inch display on the Nokia 5.3, and knowing that it has some sort of protection is reassuring.

However, the market is crowded, and as most other smartphones were moving to the 18:9 aspect ratio, last year'sNokia 5, Nokia 6(Review) and Nokia 8(Review) looked dated in comparison.So when HMD Global had an event at MWC this year, people were expecting more from the brand. The company delivered with better specifications at multiple price points, and an updated design for its Nokia 7 Plus. With an 18:9 display, the new 7 Plus is the first Nokia-brandedsmartphone to follow this trend. HMD Global has also packed in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor and enrolled into Googles Android One programme. The smartphone has quickly made its way to India with a price tag of Rs 25,999.

Now, HMD Global, which sells phones under the Nokia brand, has finally rolled out a successor: the aptly titled, identically priced Nokia 7.2, that mostly picks up where its predecessor left off  for better and worse.Sure, the Nokia 7.2 is better in lots of little ways, but the midrange smartphone market isn't the same as it was a year ago. Today, the Finnish brand has Google's Pixel 3a and its flagship-class camera to contend with, as well as Samsung's bold reentry into the segment with the well-rounded Galaxy A50. And although the Nokia 7.2 is once again compelling enough to land on our list of the finest budget handsets, in that company, it struggles to rise to the level of the best Android phones overall.I'm of two minds about the Nokia 7.2 from a design perspective.

This device is the realisation of a long-held dream of many enthusiasts - a Nokia-branded Android smartphone with flagship-class specifications.The Nokia 8 packs the Snapdragon 835 SoC - a chip that nearly all current-generation Android flagships are built around - and comes with near-stock Android. That means theres little room for differentiation in terms of specifications or software. Instead, like many other OEMs, HMD is pinning its hopes on the camera to act as the big selling proposition for its most expensive smartphone till date.To that end, HMD has revived Nokias iconic partnership with Carl Zeiss AG - the brand that lent its name to many famous Nokia camera phones back in the day - for the front and rear cameras of the Nokia 8.

While Android Go was introduced with the intent of bringing Android to sub-Rs. 5,000 devices with 1GB of RAM or less in 2018, it did not really take off in India.

The company set out to make a 'flagship killer' that offered high-end specifications at half the usual price, and delivered on that promise - at least on paper.(Also see: OnePlus 3 Review)The OnePlus One's modest success was helped by Google's decision last year not to subsidise Nexus phones anymore, which meant the Nexus 6 didn't get the kind of patronage from geeks that its predecessors had received. Combined with some clever marketing - most notably the invite system - it's no surprise that the One found its share of admirers, despite some long-term reliability issues.The OnePlus 2 aims to build on that success, and even though it sports a price tag that's greater than the One's, there's enough to keep the specifications-obsessed happy. For a smartphone that's clearly targeted at technophiles, the OnePlus 2 has some notable omissions: the lack of a microSD slot, NFC, and fast charging come to mind.

We aim to answer these two burning questions in our OnePlus 5 review.OnePlus 5 design and build qualityNow before we get started, we need to address the elephant in the room  design. From the front, this phone looks very similar to the OnePlus 3T (Review), but with more rounded corners and slight curves on the top and bottom. Given a fleeting glance, it would be hard to tell the difference"
149,oneplus 5t,"If you've just released a pretty good product but come up with an improvement just a short while later, should you release it immediately, or wait for some time to pass? The advantage of going ahead is that you can keep up with competitors who might have released products with new features and capabilities since your launch, and you get to create a whole new hype cycle. The downside of course is the backlash from buyers who picked up your earlier product and would feel let down or even betrayed by such rapid forced obsolescence. That's exactly the position OnePlus was in, and from what the company has said, it didn't hesitate at all to launch the OnePlus 5T just five months after the OnePlus 5.This is a company that has built its identity on delivering more than the big guns can, and that too at lower prices. Samsung and LG both had the same idea earlier this year - make phone screens taller instead of increasing their size proportionately, and that way you can stretch them without the awkwardness of an overgrown phablet. However, Samsung and LG are gigantic multinational corporations that manufacture their own displays. It took a while for third-party suppliers to catch up, but Vivo, Oppo and Honor are already shipping 18:9 models. OnePlus just couldn't afford to not be playing on the same level. That's why the OnePlus 5 is now on its way out despite the"

It was a pretty safe bet that as long as OnePlus made the requisite annual updates, like improving the device's processor and dual cameras, the OnePlus 6 (starting at $529) would be another hit.Sure enough, OnePlus has defined this year's flagship killer, with all the performance and features you could possibly want from any smartphone, rolled into a package that costs hundreds less than top-tier offerings from Apple, Samsung and Google.

The $549 entry-level 6T remains about half the price of other flagship phones with edge-to-edge displays and cutting-edge specs, and you don't even have to sacrifice great photos or solid battery life to save all that money.And a new carrier partnership with T-Mobile widens the availability of the 6T, which will make OnePlus more competitive with the likes of Google, Samsung and even Apple.

The company has consistently launched powerful smartphones with top-of-the-line hardware at relatively affordable prices.

While more expensive than some fans would have liked, the OnePlus 6 still offered great value for money compared toestablished brands such asSamsung and Apple, helping OnePlus capture a huge portion of the premium smartphone market in India.OnePlus' six-month upgrade cycle then resulted in the launch of the OnePlus 6T(Review) which managed to further strengthen its position. In addition to premium build quality, it also offered an in-display fingerprint scanner, which wasn't very common at the time of its launch.With Samsung having now retakenthe top spot in the premium smartphone market with the Galaxy S10(Review) series, OnePlus is using a two-pronged approach by bringing in the OnePlus Pro to compete at the top end of the market, while the OnePlus 7is intended to maintainthe company's hold over the lower-end of the premium smartphone segment.We have already testedthe OnePlus 7 Pro(Review) and we were impressed with the power it packs.

The OnePlus 7 (Review), positioned well below the superior 7 Pro, has already been refreshed. The new OnePlus 7T (Review) has borrowed many features from the OnePlus 7 Pro (Review), and its design, cameras, and display have all been improved, making it nearly as good as its more premium sibling.So now, with the launch of the OnePlus 7T Pro, has the company made equally big changes to its higher tier model in just four months? Well, the short answer is no. The new OnePlus 7T Pro is a minor refresh with a slightly faster processor, a marginally bigger battery, and faster charging.

These days, flagships are routinely launched at prices north of Rs. 1,00,000, and OnePlus has kept pace. The new OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro were just introduced with starting prices of Rs. 49,999 and Rs. 64,999 respectively, putting them well and truly into the premium tier. Unfortunately, for many people, purchasing power has not risen quite as much. The kind of buyer who felt like they were getting a great deal when, say, the OnePlus 5 launched at Rs. 32,999 in mid-2017, is unlikely to feel the same way about the current generation when it's time to upgrade.And so, the company that promised us we'd never settle is now asking some of its most loyal fans to do exactly that. The OnePlus 9R is a response to rising prices and an attempt to cater to people who want something fresh and don't mind a few cut corners, relative to the OnePlus 9(Review) and OnePlus 9 Pro(Review).

The company uses an innovative invite-based system for distributing limited quantities of its devices while creating hype and a level of demand that far outstrips the supply. The marketing department of OnePlus is run by absolute geniuses.Soon after launching this year's 'flagship killer', the OnePlus 2 (Review), the company launched a more budget-friendly model, the Rs. 16,999 OnePlus X.

Oppo has quietly launched updates to its value-focused A9 (Review) and A5 smartphones, called the A9 2020 and A5 2020 respectively. The names might indicate that they are slight refreshes over their predecessors, but there are significant changes under the hood that warrant a close look.These new models are of course meant to help the company stay current in the face of newer models from sister companies Vivo and Realme as well as Xiaomi, Samsung, and others. Both, the Oppo A9 2020 and the Oppo A5 2020, share a lot of common features, including their processors and batteries.

While there has been wide adoption of notches from every phone manufacturer, it seems as though hole-punch and pop-up designs are slowly gaining steam. The Oppo F11 Pro is the newest smartphone to sport a pop-up selfie camera, and it is priced considerably lower than some previous examples such as the Vivo Nex (Review) and the Oppo Find X (Review). Should that be the only reason for you to consider buying this smartphone or is there more to it?

The Oppo F11 Pro isn't an exception, and is available in Thunder Black and Aurora Green. Our unit was the Thunder Black variant.

But what about the rest? Even though there isn't too much competition, there are some heavy-hitters such as the Redmi K20(Review), and the more recent Realme 7 Pro(Review), both of which directly compete with the F17 Pro.

Shortly after, we got the F1 Plus, which was a more premium model. The company has been marketing this new series aggressively, especially in offline retail channels.It's been more than six months since the launch of the F1, and to be honest, it feels a bit dated today given how the competition has marched forward. The F1s is a much-needed upgrade, in terms of both design and features, in order to give it a fighting chance. The focus however, continues to be on the front-facing camera. Let's see how it fares.Design and buildIt would be easy to mistake the F1s for the F1 Plus since they look virtually identical from the front. The mildly curved edges of the display offer a pleasant feeling when you hold this phone, and the slim bezel adds a bit of style. The phone has a pre-installed screen guard which attracts scratches fairly easily, and we think this could have been done away with since there is Gorilla Glass 4 for protection.The 5.5-inch IPS display produces rich colours, and the maximum brightness level is much better than the Oppo F1 could manage.

In order to achieve price point, Oppo has made a few compromises in the materials used for the chassis, the rear camera, and the processor under the hood. Lets see if the new Oppo F3 can still deliver good value despite these reductions.Oppo F3 design and build qualityIf youve use the Oppo F3 Plus or at least held it, then youll instantly appreciate the smaller size of the Oppo F3.

173,oppo f3 plus,"Oppo has had a good run with its photography-centric F series ever sincethe Oppo F1 (Review) launched in February last year. Since then, weve also had the F1s(Review) and the F1 Plus(Review) smartphones to fill different gaps in the mid-range segment. Oppo is still promoting this series heavily today, both online and offline, and were pretty sure it has been a major contributor to the companys strong position in the Indian market.In 2017, Oppo is hoping to expand its reach with the new F3 series, of whichthe F3 Plus is the first model. Selfie-obsessed buyerscontinue to be the target here and for that reason, Oppo has outfitted this phone with dual front cameras. Unlike Vivos V5 Plus(Review), the second camera isnt used for depth of field. Instead, the Oppo F3 Plus has a wide-angle lens for group selfies, which actually seems like a much more practical idea that's likely to have awiderappeal (punintended).Oppo usually caters to people shopping in the sub-Rs. 20,000 price segment, so the sticker price of Rs. 30,990 for the F3 Plus might be a little difficult to digest. Has Oppo done enough to justify this kind of a price premium? Lets take a look"
174,oppo f5,"Like it or not, taller screens are apparently the biggest smartphone design trend of 2017. Not every company can pull off curved glass, and metal bodies are expensive, but apparently it doesn't take that much effort to stretch out a display panel. We started off this year with Samsung and LG bestowing their flagship Galaxy S8(Review) and LG G6(Review) models with the first two examples of taller screens, but more recently we've seen low-end smartphones such as the Micromax Canvas Infinity(Review)and several mid-range onestrying to capitalise on the attention.Oppo has done exactly the same thing with its latest launch, the F5. The design even overshadows Oppo's usual emphasis on its front cameras with the F-series, even though there's also a whole new ""AI-powered"" selfie enhancement feature to brag about.Maybe that shouldn't be surprising, because this is an improvement that you can see immediately, and a lot of people will first be attracted to this phone for this reason. No matter whether you're more interested in the new Oppo F5 for what's on the surface or what's lying within, we're going to be examining it in great detail.Oppo F5 designMost companies that have adopted taller 18:9 screens have stopped somewhere short of achieving a true borderless look, and the F"

In a world of increasingly generic-looking phones, and manufacturers all racing to copy the same design cues, Oppo has decided to be a little different. The F9 Pro is instantly noticeable and recognisable, no matter which of its three very different finishes you choose - and no, there is no sober, low-key option. If you want something that will work unobtrusively in a corporate environment, or if you don't like getting curious glances when you're out in public, there are plenty of other smartphones that will suit you better.While looks will be the primary consideration for buyers, Oppo is prioritising fashion as well as features. There's a new, more subtle notch; the promise of excellent battery life plus quick charging; and of course Oppo's usual emphasis on selfies. All these things combined might earn the F9 Pro a few fans - and it needs to play up every advantage it can draw on, now that the Poco F1(Review) has completely rewritten the rules of the Rs. 20,000 - 30,000 price bracket.Oppo F9 Pro designUnlike most phones these days, the emphasis here is on the back.

""This is a damn clever way to do a full-screen phone,"" I said to myself. And then I said something else: ""Is this just a gimmick?""Yes, Chinese giant Oppo has found a way to obliterate bezels without copying the iPhone X's notch. The 6.4-inch Find X (about $850 unlocked, if you track it down from overseas) is also arguably the most beautiful phone ever made, thanks to its 3D glass design and stunning Glacier Blue or Bordeaux Red color.But Oppo also shamelessly copied features from both the iPhone X and latest Galaxy phones, and the dual rear cameras didn't blow me away as much as the design. Here's what I like  and don't like  about the Find X.The Find X is an absolute revelation of a design compared with the sea of iPhone X clones out there. The first thing I noticed about Oppo's phone was the lack of a notch or any bezels up front, as this flagship boasts a screen-to-body ratio of 93.8 percent. Thats because the front and rear cameras are hidden inside a sliding mechanism that's whisper-quiet (more on that below).I absolutely love the Glacier Blue back, which"

The Find X has a motorised module at the top which would rise to reveal it's front and rear cameras, allowing for a big display without a notch.Oppo is finally adding new phones to this series after a long break. The new Oppo Find X2 and Oppo Find X2 Pro are designed conservatively in comparison to the Find X, but can they take the legacy forward? I got to spend some time with the Find X2 Pro, and here are my first impressions of it.The Oppo Find X2 Pro is clearly the new flagship from Oppo, and it looks the part. It is well designed and in line with current trends. Just like the Oppo Find X(Review), the Find X2 Pro has a big display with curved sides. The display measures 6.7-inches and has thin bezels all around, giving this device a 93.1 percent screen-to-body ratio.

Oppo's RX17 launched in the United Kingdom earlier this year, but that device had launched in China in August of last year. The Reno, the company's new, photography-focused smartphone, is the first (roughly) simultaneous product launch the make has had, with the debut coming just two months after the Chinese launch.In the last 12 months, we've seen both the Huawei P30 Pro and the Google Pixel 3 dominate the market for best camera phones, and the OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S10 have upped the ante for flagship features. The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom, the high-end version of Oppo's latest smartphone product line, doesn't initially look like it could compete with those handsets. But with some neat ideas of its own and a few more cribbed from rivals and stablemates, Oppo has shipped a convincing competitor to the established brands, adding a few features that will really turn heads.You can buy the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom and the standard Reno from a handful of online retailers, including Amazon, from 545 (roughly $660 when converted) for the lowest-spec version (6GB/128GB).

The Reno 2 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G SoC, boasts of a quad-camera setup, and has a shark-fin pop-up selfie module.

The Oppo Reno 2 stands out a bit thanks to its shark fin pop-up camera module. At the front, the smartphone sports a 6.5-inch AMOLED display and has thin bezels all around. The shark fin module on the Reno 2 swivels up to reveal the selfie camera. This module also houses the secondary microphone and the earpiece.

If that wasn't bad enough, its price of Rs. 34,990 for the sole 8GB RAM configuration isn't sitting well with a lot of people, especially since it uses an SoC we're used to seeing in phones under Rs. 20,000.However, if you look past the processor and pricing for a moment, you'll find that there's a lot to like about the Reno 4 Pro. It managed to make a good first impression on me a few weeks ago, and now that I've spent a decent amount of time using it, I'm ready to decide whether good looks can make up for the lack of power, even if that comes at a high cost.Oppo Reno 4 Pro design and display: Its best featuresThe premium design of the Reno 4 Pro helps it stand out from the competition and is easily one of its best attributes.

Thats why I was pretty excited about the Pixel 5, which concentrates on the camera, battery life, software, and most importantly this year, the price.Ive been using the Pixel 5 for a little while, and frustratingly, Google has gone a little too far in its normalization efforts. Gone are the quirks that made some warm to old Pixels, and while the camera is still a winner, it hasnt moved the game forward in the way the Pixel 4 did. Im getting a bit ahead of myself here, so lets go into detail.Google has never been one for giving the Pixel a wild design, but it is very good at making a sensibly sized phone, and the Pixel 5 is exactly right. The metal body is welcome, as its warm to the touch, doesnt get covered in fingerprints, and should be durable too. The nicely rounded sides make it easy to grip and hold, and the overall size and 8mm thickness  similar to other well-proportioned phones like the iPhone 11 Pro  is just right. Its also astonishingly light at just 151 grams.All this makes it very easy to live with, and the Pixel 5 will appeal to anyone who finds many phones released recently too large to hold. Most people"

The company has launched the Poco F3 GT in India as the next model in the F series, and this smartphone too focuses on performance.

Going by the name, it wouldn't be wrong to assume that it's a more powerful version of the Poco M3, which it is in a few ways. However, in order to offer these upgrades while keeping the price under control, Poco has made some compromises too such as the removal of stereo speakers, and the use of a lower capacity battery.The Poco M3 Pro 5G is currently the company's most affordable 5G offering, and as I stated in my first impressions article, it competes directly with the Realme 8 5G and the Realme Narzo 30 Pro 5G  two other affordable 5G smartphones in India at the moment.

The Poco F1 was all about its high-end processor and made no apologies about lagging in other departments. With a new focus on the youth market, Poco has chosen a slightly different approach for the X3 Pro.

Xiaomi has long been dominating the mainstream smartphone segment in India, which makes it the biggest competitor to Realme.The Realme 3 Pro has some pretty big shoes to fill, considering its predecessor, the Realme 2 Prowas and continues to be a solid option in its price segment.

Armed with an impressive resume of features, it's time to see if the Realme 5 can deliver an equally impressive Android experience.Realme 5 designRealme has updated its design language a bit with the Realme 5. The phone still uses a polycarbonate body with a laminated plastic back, but it's taller than the Realme 3 and features a larger display.

However, since its launch, we've seen several competitors come along, most notably the Vivo U10 and Redmi Note 8  all vying for the top spot in that coveted sub-Rs. 10,000 market.Naturally, Realme wasn't going to sit idly by, and now we have the Realme 5s. As its name suggests, it's a tweaked version of the Realme 5, with the big changes being a 48-megapixel primary camera and a new Crystal Red' colour.

While the Realme 6 was a good smartphone at launch, its price has gone up thanks to recent currency value changes, putting it out of reach for a few people. The Realme 6i borrows some key hardware from the Realme 6 but starts at a much lower price of Rs. 12,999. With toned-down specifications and the lowered price, has Realme managed to strike the right balance? I review the Realme 6i to find out.Realme 6i design: Identical to the Realme 6Realme has been launching smartphones with the i suffix for some time now. Its strategy has been to take an existing model (the Realme 6 in this case) and change a few key specifications to get to a lower price. Because these are minor changes, the overall design and dimensions remain identical. Realme has tried to distinguish the Realme 6i by offering it in Lunar White and Eclipse Black colour options.

From my perspective, the Realme 7 brings in three main upgrades  a new SoC, a bigger battery, and a new primary camera sensor. Let's see if these upgrades are enough to make it worth recommending.Realme 7 design and display: Somewhat newNo new Realme smartphone is complete without a fresh design for the back. The Realme 7 features a mirror-split design, which creates some interesting patterns when light hits it. The colour option I have is called Mist Blue, but there's also white.

The most notable ones are the use of an AMOLED display, stereo speakers, and 65W fast charging, which sounds very impressive.The Realme 7 Pro starts at Rs. 19,999, which is quite a bit higher than the price that the 6 Pro launched at. Its main rivals right now include the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max(Review) and the Poco X2(Review), and to some extent, higher the variant could compete with the Redmi K20(Review) and Oppo F17 Pro.

I'm referring to the recently launched Realme 8, which launched alongside the Realme 8 Pro. The company has managed to cover pretty much every single price point under Rs. 20,000, but the sheer number of phones it now sells, including the 7 series, X-series and Narzo models, means that there's a lot of overlapping, with just minute differences between many of them.The Realme 8 starts at Rs. 14,999 and going purely by specifications, is essentially a slimmer Realme 7 with an AMOLED display. The Realme 7 itself is essentially a Realme 6 Pro with a MediaTek SoC instead of Qualcomm, and both these models are also still on sale at similar prices. The top-end variant of the Realme 8, which I'll be reviewing, costs Rs. 16,999. This means it competes directly with the Realme Narzo 30 Pro, which happens to have a 5G SoC and a 120Hz display.

I put it to the test to find out.Realme 8s 5G price in IndiaThe Realme 8s 5G starts at Rs. 17,999 in India for the base variant which has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, while the higher variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage is priced at Rs. 19,999. Interestingly, these are the same prices and RAM/storage configurations that the Realme 8 Pro sells for, though there are many other differences between these two models. You can buy the Realme 8s 5G in Universe Blue or Universe Purple.Realme 8s 5G designThe Realme 8s 5G looks nearly identical to the Realme 8 5G, which might have been the base to build this new smartphone on. Just like the Realme 8 5G, this new phone sports a 6.5-"
199,realme c11,"The new Realme C11 comes as a solution to the problem of rising prices across the industry. It is priced at Rs. 7,499, and is positioned below the Realme C3, which until now was the company's most affordable entry-level phone. The budget end of the market, which is perpetually squeezed in terms of margins and flexibility, is of course the worst hit by cost revisions. If your budget is less than Rs. 10,000, even a difference of Rs. 500 between models and variants could swing your decision.The Realme C3(Review) was launched starting at Rs. 6,999 at the beginning of this year, but multiple revisions later the same unit now costs Rs. 8,999. The very similar Narzo 10A(Review) was meant to be a step up, but its price of Rs. 8,499 announced in May has now become Rs. 8,999 as well. That has not only caused confusion, but also left a gap at the bottom of the market to be filled.It's unfortunate that you aren't getting as much for your money anymore, but the past few years have seen such intense competition that the overall standard for the budget segment has risen considerably, and you should still be able to get a good deal. Is the Realme C11 the right phone at the right time? Read on to find out."
200,realme c12,"The Realme C12 and Realme C15 have been launched in India, not too long after Realme introduced the C11(Review) roughly a month ago. The recent GST hike in India has impacted all smartphone manufacturers, forcing them to increase prices. In Realme's case, this left some big price gaps in its budget portfolio, that these two new models will fill. The Realme C12 is priced at Rs. 8,999 for 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage,while Realme C15 is priced at Rs. 9,999 for 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and Rs. 10,999 for 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.Today, we'll be checking out the Realme C12, which isn't too different from the C11. This means it also has a lot in common with the Realme C3 and Narzo 10A. The main differences are to do with a couple of areas such as the battery and cameras. The Realme C12 and the Realme C15 are not meant to replace any of the existing C-series phones, as Realme emphatically tells us, but rather complement the current models.I initially planned on giving you my first impressions of both phones, together, since they are so similar. Unfortunately, Realme has slightly delayed the higher priced model, so it will be a"

202,realme gt master edition,"The Realme GT Master Edition seems to offer everything that anyone could ask for in a mid-range smartphone. It has a high-quality Super AMOLED display, a new processor, and a battery that charges up from zero to 100 percent in about 35 minutes. It's got slightly better hardware than the OnePlus Nord 2, so it might be an interesting alternative within the same price segment. Then, there's the recently launched Motorola Edge 20, which is priced a few thousand Rupees higher, but offers a lot more in terms of hardware plus near-stock software, in a slim and sleek package. The GT Master Edition is the most affordable of these three, but will that give it enough of an edge?Realme GT Master Edition price in IndiaThe Realme GT Master Edition is available in three variants, but not all of them can be bought in all the colour options that have been announced. The Cosmos Black, Luna White, and Voyager Grey finishes are available if you choose the 8GB RAM and 128GB or 256GB storage options, which are priced at Rs. 27,999 and Rs. 29,999 respectively. There's also a 6GB RAM and 128GB storage variant, which is only available in Voyager Grey and serves as the base variant, priced at Rs. 25,999. So, if you were looking to grab the Realme GT at Rs. 25,999"
203,realme gt neo 2,"The Realme GT Neo 2 is the third smartphone in Realme's new GT series of devices to be launched in India. Despite its premium looks, it sits comfortably between the mid-range Realme GT Master Edition (Review) and the premium Realme GT (Review).Considering its more approachable price, the Realme GT Neo 2 is missing the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 from the GT, as Realme decided on the Snapdragon 870 instead. There are no fancy Maglev Triggers, dedicated gaming button, or RGB lighting like on the Poco F3 GT (Review), but this new phone's AMOLED display is equipped with a high touch sampling rate that gamers will like. With a more subtle design, can the Realme GT Neo 2 attract gamers as well as the non-gaming crowd? After using it for a short while, here are my first impressions.The Realme GT Neo is officially priced starting at Rs. 31,999 in India and is available in three finishes: Neo Green, Neo Blue, and Neo Black. I have received the signature Neo Green unit for review. The phone is available in two variants, onewith 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage priced at Rs. 31,999, and the second with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is priced at Rs. 35,999.

204,realme narzo 10a,"Realme Narzo 10A is the more affordable model in the new Narzo series, and is getting quite a lot of attention thanks to a high-profile launch. Priced under Rs. 10,000, the Narzo 10A doesn't promise quite as much as the Narzo 10,but should be a solid addition to your list of choices if you're looking for a new budget phone. Even before we got the phone, we couldsay with some confidence that the Narzo 10A will do well in its review, since it's very nearly identical to the Realme C3, which was launched at the beginning of this year and has dominated our buying guide.Luckily for Realme, prime competitor Xiaomi has yet to launch its Redmi 9 series in India. The company might have chosen 10 as its product name just to mess with Xiaomi, because the Narzo 10A will go up against the Redmi 9a whenever it is launched.However, anyone who has recently bought the Realme C3 (Review) will probably be annoyed since the Narzo 10A costs just Rs. 500 more and fixes one big complaint that we had with it. Read on for our full review.Realme Narzo 10A designThe Narzo 10A is exactly the same shape and size as the Realme C3, and in fact it's imperceptibly slimmer than the the Red"
205,realme narzo 20,"When Realme launched its Narzo series earlier this year, the company said it was meeting customer demand for low-cost phones with powerful processors, even if that meant compromises in other areas such as camera quality. The Narzo series was meant for a different audience, rather than a specific price segment, and so some amount of overlap with other models was expected. However, the Narzo 10 and 10A turned out to be renamed versions of the Realme 6i and C3 respectively with barely any differences. Now, we have the new Narzo 20, 20A, and 20 Pro  but will the same story play out?The new Narzo 20 is extremely similar to the Realme C12 and Realme C15 in terms of design and features, and we'restruggling to see the segmentation when it comes tospecifications. It's priced starting Rs. 500 lower than the Realme C15 and offers a superior processor but at the cost of some potential compromises when it comes to the cameras.What's going on here, and is Realme making things too confusing for buyers? Who should buy one of these models, and who should buy the others? I'm going to attempt to answer these questions in my review of the Realme Narzo 20.Realme Narzo 20 price and specifications: Dj vu?The primary thing that sets the Realme Narzo 20"
206,realme x,"Realme introduced a new premium X' model back in May, as its first proper flagship in the Chinese market. With the Realme X, the company has tried to incorporate many flagship-level features while still hitting that sub-Rs. 20,000 price segment, in which it currently has some pretty popular phones, such as the Realme 3 Pro (Review). The Realme X is now in India, and while it might lack a true flagship-level processor, it tries to balance that out with a modern, notch-free design, pop-up selfie camera, and in-display fingerprint sensor  all at a very affordable price.We currently have some really good options under Rs. 20,000 such as the Samsung Galaxy M40 (Review), Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review), and Vivo Z1 Pro (Review), so the Realme X has some tough competition. On paper, it seems as though Realme has covered its bases pretty well, and now it's time to see if can deliver the kind of results we're expecting in day-to-day usage.Realme X designThe Realme X scores well in terms of design, and apart from the striking looks, it even feels premium.

207,realme x2,"Realme X2 hit Indian shores earlier this week, and we've reviewed the latest mid-range smartphone from the Chinese brand. We've known since September that Realme would be launching the Realme XT 730G this month, and that time has finally come. Now known as the Realme X2, this is the company's answer to Xiaomi's Redmi Note 8 Pro, which is one of the most powerful current-gen smartphones that you can buy for less than Rs. 20,000.The Realme X2 comes in at roughly the same price points as the Realme XT(Review), but features a much more powerful processor, quicker charging, and a higher-resolution front camera. All in all, it seems to be a pretty decent upgrade on paper. The main attraction here though is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G SoC, which is targeted at gamers. This SoC is said to offer better graphics performance than its counterpart, the Snapdragon 730, as well as better overall performance compared to the Snapdragon 710 and 712. The Realme X2 is also the first phone in this segment to be built around this chip, thanks to aggressive pricing from Realme.If you're one of the many people always looking out for a good smartphone priced under Rs. 20,000, you'll be wondering whether the Realme X2 is the best offering right now."
208,realme x2 pro,"Realme is stepping up its game with its latest offering, the Realme X2 Pro. With a starting price of Rs. 29,999, the Realme X2 Pro offers many of the features found in higher-priced mid-range flagships, which automatically boosts its value proposition. This is also the company's first true' flagship offering,and is the first time that Realme is venturing above the over-Rs. 20,000 price segment in India. So far, the company has earned a reputation for making budget-friendly phones, but with the X2 Pro, can it convince its fanbase and new potential buyers to spend this much money for its top-end offering? We've been testing the X2 Pro for about a week, and it's now time to see if this premium smartphone has managed to pull it off.Realme X2 Pro designWe've covered most of the design and usability aspects of the Realme X2 Pro in our first impressions of it, so we'll be brief here. Realme has finally moved beyond the polycarbonate bodies we've seen so far on its phones, for an aluminium body with Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back. This makes the X2 Profeel very good to hold. Everything is put together nicely. The device can be a little slippery and the glass back attracts smudges easily, but it"
209,realme x3 superzoom,"Realme has once again raised the bar for what consumers should expect from a mid-range premium smartphone with its new X3 and X3 SuperZoom devices. With prices starting at just Rs. 24,999 for the Realme X3and Rs. 27,999 for the Realme X3 SuperZoom, you can expect a top-of-the-line 4G SoC, a fast 120Hz display, and high-quality optics. Today we'll be checking out the X3 SuperZoom, whose highlight feature is an impressive-looking telephoto camera that's capable of 5x optical and 60x hybrid zoom. Periscope-style camera systems have so far been used in more expensive Android phones, but with the X3 SuperZoom, Realme is bringing this tech to a wider audience.Simply looking at the specifications and price, the Realme X3 SuperZoom seems all set to be a great all-rounder. Should you buy it rather than other similarly priced offerings such as the Realme X2 Pro(Review)or the OnePlus 7T(Review)? Let's find out.Realme X3 SuperZoom cameras: Great in daylightThe main difference between the Realme X3 and the SuperZoom model is the telephoto camera. The X3 SuperZoom features an 8-megapixel periscope-style camera with"
210,realme x50 pro 5g,"Is India ready for a 5G smartphone? The short answer is no. We have no commercial 5G networks and no clear indications that they will be rolling out in India in the near future. Major telecom operators are struggling after having slashed tariffs thanks to price wars over the past few years, so we can't be sure that any of them will undertake major infrastructure upgrades across the country this year, and then of course there's the massive cost of 5G spectrum blocks. When 5G rolls out, it will likely cost more than we are all used to paying now, and it will be a while before 5G-enabled phones are commonplace.The long answer is that 5G is coming anyway, and if you want to be one of the first to be able to use it when towers do light up, you might as well have a 5G phone now. Realmeand several other companies are hoping to capture this early adopter market. Besides, it doesn't make sense to develop 5G-capable flagships for some parts of the world and entirely different products for others. The Realme X50 Pro 5G is not only Realme's most expensive model yet in India, but it's also the first 5G phone and the first one with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865 processor to officially be launched in India.We won't be able to test its 5G functionality but we can say"
211,realme x7 5g,"The new Realme X7 5G and X7 Pro 5G are aimed at the mainstream and flagship killer market respectively, and both are priced to bring some serious competition to longstanding favourites. We've just seen what the higher-end Realme X7 Pro 5G(Review) has to offer, and now it's time for a full review of the more affordable Realme X7 5G. Launched at Rs. 19,999 for the 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage variant and Rs. 21,999 for 8GB of RAM with 128GB of storage, it will have to contend with the Mi 10i(Review), Samsung Galaxy M31s(Review), and even the Realme 7 Pro(Review), amongst others.While many of these competitors have gone all-out with the cameras, Realme is focusing more on design and performance with the new X7 5G, which has just been launched. There are a few little touches that add value, but also some interesting choices that might cause potential buyers to think twice. Read on to see if this is the right upgrade option for you.Realme X7 5G designNo one can say that Realme has played it safe with the X7 series, but whether that's a good thing or a bad thing will be a matter of personal taste and a very subjective call.

212,realme xt,"Realme is adding a new expert' member to its smartphone family, called the Realme XT. The main highlight of the Realme XT its 64-megapixel sensor, which is a big step up from the 48-megapixel sensors we've been seeing of late. The name XT' would lead you to believe that this phone is a successor or at least part of the Realme X line, but it's more of a souped-up version of the Realme 5 Pro. The Realme XT is positioned between the Realme 5 Pro and Realme X, thereby plugging in whatever price gaps exist between those two models.As for competition, there isn't any at the moment, if you consider the phone's main selling point. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro, which is another 64-megapixel camera phone, is yet to launch in India. This gives the Realme XT free reign in its price segment and a ripe opportunity for Realme to make the most of it, until the true competition arrives. So, is that 64-megapixel camera everything its hyped out to be? It's time to put the Realme XT to the test and find out.Realme XT designFirst, let's a talk a bit about the design.

However, all of this comes at an increased price: the Redmi 10 Prime starts at Rs. 12,499, higher than the launch price of the Redmi 9 Prime. Is the new Redmi 10 Prime worth the price it commands or should you look elsewhere?

214,redmi note 10,"With the new Redmi Note 10 family, Xiaomi is offering more premium features than ever, but prices have also risen. The Redmi Note series has been massively popular so far in India, where everyone loves a good deal and buyers are very particular about every last feature and specification. If a smartphone has a big screen, high-capacity battery, fast processor, and lots of RAM and storage, but still manages to cost less than Rs. 15,000, chances are it will be successful. That's where the Redmi Note 10 comes in.Priced at Rs. 11,999 (4GB RAM/64GB storage) and Rs. 13,999 (6GB RAM, 128GB storage), the Redmi Note 10 doesn't have a massive 108-megapixel rear camera like the much more premium Redmi Note 10 Pro Max(First Impressions). It also doesn't have a 120Hz display like the middle sibling, the Redmi Note 10. Still, the three share a lot of features and design touches, and you might be surprised by what the complete package has to offer.Redmi Note 10 designXiaomi has introduced a new Evol design language which freshens up the Redmi Note 10 series a bit.

The Redmi Note 10 is still a capable smartphone and it managed a good score in our review. Xiaomi claims to have improved upon the Redmi Note 10 by using a different processor, more RAM, and a higher resolution primary camera sensor, all for a small bump in price. Should you pay the premium for the Redmi Note 10S, or spend this money elsewhere? I put the Redmi Note 10S through our tests to find out.Redmi Note 10S price in IndiaThe Redmi Note 10S commands a premium over the Redmi Note 10(Review) and is available in two variants.

216,redmi note 9 pro,"The Redmi Note 9 Pro has just been launched in India, and its starting price of Rs. 12,999 is surprisingly low because Xiaomi has made a few very interesting decisions in terms of positioning and features. It isn't easy to stay ahead of the game, and the Redmi Note 9 Pro goes up against the formidable Realme 6 and Samsung M30s. Longtime fans of the series might be surprised at how Xiaomi has actually held back a little with this model, since expectations are always when a new generation of Redmi Note smartphones is announced.Previous models, most notably the Redmi Note 8 Pro(Review), have been defined by their positioning above the standard Redmi series and the aspirational features they offer. While prices are still very reasonable, Xiaomi has made a habit of delivering things that people will be tempted to spend a little more money on, such large displays, high-capacity batteries, multiple cameras, premium styling, and class-leading specifications.The tradeoff for that new low price is that the Redmi Note 9 Pro does not offer many of today's most buzzworthy features  a 90Hz display, extremely fast charging, and high-resolution cameras. This phone is more about core specifications and the overall usage experience. In an interesting shuffle, though, some of these features can be found in a new higher-tier device, the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max."
217,redmi note 9 pro max,"The Redmi Note 9 Pro and the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max look virtually identical and share a lot of hardware, but the more premium Max model has better front and rear cameras, more RAM, and faster charging. This is a change of strategy as well as naming and pricing conventions for Xiaomi's Redmi series, which we can all agree has established itself as a leader in the budget smartphone market. Its grip is so strong that it has at least one smartphone for pretty much every price point between Rs 7,000 and Rs. 20,000. The Redmi Note 9 Pro and the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max are the successors to the Redmi Note 8 and the Redmi Note 8 Pro respectively.This begs the question  are the extra features of the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max worth paying more for, or would you be better off with the Redmi Note 9 Pro instead?

And it actually looks pretty sharp for a bargain, too.Once upon a time, we would have named it our go-to sub-$400 phone in a heartbeat.

219,samsung galaxy a50s,"We began this year with an avalanche of affordable Galaxy M-series and A-series smartphones from Samsung as part of the company's strategy to fight Xiaomi, Realme, and others on their terms. Samsung addressed pretty much every strategic price point between Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 20,000 in a very short span of time, sometimes with multiple options thanks to the sheer number of models and variants that were launched. It's been a while now since that rush of launches, and Samsung's competitors have all refreshed their slates, so it was inevitable that we'd see a few updated models from the Korean giant.The brand new Samsung Galaxy A50s is priced starting at Rs. 22,999, which is a slight bump up in cost compared to the Galaxy A50 (Review). It joins the party shortly after the high-profile Redmi K20 (Review) was launched, and a few other flagship-grade phones have seen price cuts that place them in this segment as well.

The GalaxyA52 has so far been a decent mid-range offering, and stands out thanks to its IP67 rating, which most other phones in the mid-range don't have. With a starting price of Rs. 26,499 for the 6GB RAM variant, the Galaxy A52 still offers decent value even though it isn't the most modern phone.Now, with the Galaxy A52s, Samsung has added a couple of improved features and specifications. There's a 120Hz display, 5G, and a new Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G SoC, which performs better than the Snapdragon 720G in the A52. While the Galaxy A52s seems like an overall improvement, its higher price means it isn't a direct replacement to the Galaxy A52 (Review).Samsung Galaxy A52s price in IndiaThe Samsung Galaxy A52s, just like the Galaxy A52, is available in two variants but they are positioned considerably higher.

The Galaxy A6+ is one of four new smartphones launched by the South Korean giant in India, alongside the Galaxy A6, Galaxy J6, and Galaxy J8.Key features of the Galaxy A6+ include the aforementioned Infinity Display with its 18.5:9 aspect ratio, dual rear cameras, face recognition, and a metal unibody.

225,samsung galaxy a9 (2018),"Samsung has suddenly become a lot more adventurous of late. There's been a flurry of launches over the past few months, and it looks like the Korean giant is catching on to the fact that it needs to innovate and jump on board with trends as they happen. We usually see new top-end features debut with the flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series, and then trickle down to the mid-tier A-series and youth-focused J-series. For example, Samsung was one of the first to introduce tall, narrow Infinity Display screens, but it took ages for this well-received feature to show up on lower-tier offerings. Competitors caught on much sooner, and began selling low-cost phones that looked much more modern and sleek than Samsung's own.Now, with the Galaxy A9 (2018), Samsung is showing that it can anticipate trends  or at least keep up with other companies that do. It's quite a surprise that Samsung's first quad-camera phone is an A-series model, which makes current flagships including the very recently launched Galaxy Note 9(Review) look a bit out of date.

Samsung is heavily marketing the processing power of this phone since it has used its previous-generation flagship SoC, last seen in the Galaxy Note 10/ Note 10+ for this model which is priced much lower. It's a good move, even though Samsung is playing catch-up to companies such as Realme and Xiaomi, which have been using premium SoCs in mid-range phones for a long time. Still, better late than never.Besides the powerful processor in the Galaxy F62, you also get an AMOLED display, a good set of cameras, and a massive 7000mAh battery, all for a starting price of Rs. 23,999.

227,samsung galaxy fold,"The Samsung Galaxy Fold is a phone that elicits mixed emotions. On the one hand, theres the sheer wonder and excitement of holding a foldable phone  and seeing it transform from a 4.6-inch handset to a 7.3-inch tablet and back again. That excitement continues when you see an app that's running on the front screen instantly pop up on the larger display, and when you start running three apps at once on the bigger canvas.The other emotion is trepidation. Even though Samsung has made several enhancements to make the Galaxy Fold more durable since it delayed the devices launch, the company strongly suggests that you use a light touch when pressing on the display. Then theres the emotional sticker shock when you realize that this phone costs nearly $2,000. As I used the device for this Samsung Galaxy Fold review, I vacillated between all of these emotions  and kept coming back to a single question: Who is the Galaxy Fold made for?

The Note 10 also boasts several S-Pen enhancements (including gestures), introduces helpful video recording features and a new way to mirror the phone on a PC. Although the $949/869 Note 10 doesn't represent the pinnacle of Samsung's phablets, it should hit the sweet spot for most people in terms of size and specs. The idea of a compact phablet might sound crazy, but it actually makes a whole lot of sense when you use it.However, there are some trade-offs. You wont find a headphone jack on the Note 10, and the microSD card slot is gone, too. The Note 10s screen also isnt as sharp as its predecessor's, though you'd be hard pressed to notice a difference between them.Today the Note 10 is still a great device, even with the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 now out.

Of course, being a Note series device, it also has to have an enormous screen plus all the latest hardware.

Is it a significant enough upgrade to jump ship from your Galaxy Note 4 (Review)? Let's find out.Look and FeelSamsung has kicked it up a notch in the aesthetics department as the Galaxy Note 5 borrows many design cues from its stylus-free siblings. The phone looks premium, and is on par with the HTCs and Apples of the world. Samsung uses 7000-series aluminium and Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for the construction, which lends the Note 5 a sturdy, yet attractive feel. Unlike the Galaxy S6 Edge+, whose screen curves around the sides, the Note 5 has a more subtle curved back. This leaves you with sides wide enough to grip comfortably so there's less chance of it slipping from your hand. It's also easier to reach the power and volume buttons. The front is dominated by a gorgeous 5.7-inch QHD Super AMOLED display. Colours are punchy and text is sharp. The screen is also very legible under direct sunlight.

According to the company, The Note 8 has seen a record number of preorders and that demand has been equally strong in India too.

The answer, then,is the S Pen, which Samsung is now leaning heavily on. Over the years, it has become slimmer and more sensitive, and now it has gained a whole new set of functions.We're curious to see whether there's anything else to this phone that we haven't seen before, and whether the S Pen really elevates Android to a place that none of Samsung's competitors can reach.

Gone are the days of excessive chrome, plastic and faux leather - the new Samsung is all grown up and sophisticated. Roughly six months ago, the company launched the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, which were in such high demand that Samsung had trouble keeping up. To meet the voracious appetite of consumers, Samsung began manufacturing its two flagships in factories across twenty countries, and India was one of the chosen ones.Cut to the present and we now have two new additions to the flagship Galaxy series - the Galaxy S6 Edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5. Both follow the same design language that the S6 family set, and it seems as though Samsung will iterate on this formula for a while. Unlike the Galaxy Note Edge (Review), the Galaxy S6 Edge+ is not a companion to the Galaxy Note 5 and doesn't have any of the special features like the S Pen.

Sony isn't playing that game.Instead, the company is going after film buffs with a trio of phones that promise cinematic experiences thanks to ultrawide, 21:9 displays.The midrange Xperia 10 ($349) and 10 Plus ($429), released earlier this year, underwhelmed us with terrible performance and finicky cameras.

Ultimately, it's that unabashed geekery that will either win you over or drive you away.

The Xperia 1 II (yes, thats one two, as in the sequel to the Xperia 1) isnt a curvy all-screen phone, it doesnt have an in-display fingerprint sensor, and to get the most from the camera, it expects you to know your camera tech already. It does follow the herd with the price though, coming in at a hefty $1,200.Its refreshing to use a phone thats not a clone of another this year, but while Sony gets a lot right, the direction it takes in its effort to make the phone stand out is a little too niche.

In a departure from last year's XA2 series, the company is outfitting its latest midrange handsets, the Xperia 10 and 10 Plus, with narrow and tall displays that adopt a cinema-like 21:9 aspect ratio when used in landscape mode.That probably sounds like a gimmick, but it's actually the greatest thing about these devices. With a 21:9 screen, you can see more, when reading or watching certain videos, or do more, when you're flipping between tasks and running apps side by side.

261,sony xperia xz,"Not too long ago, Sony was one of the most revered smartphone manufacturers in India, and most regions across the world. Now, however, Sony finds itself on the fringes of the mobile market. Part of this is down to Sony's refusal to compete at the budget end of the market, where most of the action now lies. The company now operates in only a handful of markets, selling a smaller portfolio of products, and while that seems to have produced results in the short term, there are question marks over the long-term viability of Sony's mobile business.In India, for example, the sub-Rs. 15,000 and sub-Rs. 30,000 price points are arguably the two most competitive segments in the smartphone market right now, and Sony doesn't have any recent launches in either price band. The latter price bracket of course features self-proclaimed 'flagship killers' from the likes of Xiaomi and OnePlus, among others, which have undercut high-priced smartphones from the established brands by claiming to offer similar specifications and experiences at nearly half the cost. What's really hurt the likes of HTC and Sony is that phones like OnePlus 3 and Xiaomi Mi 5 deliver on these promises for the most part.Sony made its intentions of staying away from the budget segment pretty clear a while ago, so it's imperative that the likes of the Xperia XZ leave their mark in the premium segment"
262,sony xperia xz premium,"While the Sony Xperia XZs (Review) was a treat to reviewthanks to its wonderful camera,it was still tough to recommend to anyone, because of how much it overheated all the time. Now, Sony has launched an even higher-end offering in India called the Xperia XZ Premium, which costs roughly Rs. 10,000 more than the Xperia XZs.For this premium (pardon the pun), you get the brand new Snapdragon 835 SoC, making this the first phone in India to feature Qualcomm's latest and greatest,as well as a 4K HDR display, which is the first of its kind in the world. The Xperia XZ Premium is the successor to the Xperia Z5 Premium, which was the first phone to ship with a 4K display. That was two years ago, and nowSony has added HDR into the mix to keep up with the times.The pricing of Sonys new offering is true to its name,and at nearly Rs. 60,000, it competes directly with the Samsung Galaxy S8+(Review). It's time to see if Sony's new offering can stand up to Samsung's flagship, but more importantly, has Sony managed to fix the overheating issue thats plagued Xperia flagships for the past few generations? Lets begin.Sony Xperia XZ Premium design and build qualityAesthetics is a very subjective matter, but"
263,sony xperia xz1,"Sony releases two flagship smartphones every year, and though that might seem like an oddity, its not very different from what several other Android OEMs do. Samsung releases Galaxy S and Galaxy Note flagships roughly six months apart, and LGs been doing something similar with the G series and the V series.Both Samsung and LG, however, try and cater to different audiences with their two flagship ranges. Samsungs Galaxy S series is clearly meant for a mainstream users, while the Note range with its S-Pen stylus and bigger screens targets professionals focussed on productivity. Similarly, while LGs G series is the flag-bearer of its smartphone range, the V series has recently been used as an opportunity to experiment with different designs and form factors.Sony doesnt seem to have any such philosophy, and its second-half offerings can at best be considered incremental upgrades to each years main flagship, with minimal changes. Its no surprise then that the Xperia XZ1 looks virtually identical to the Xperia XZs from the front. This time, however, Sony has done enough to ensure that the Xperia XZ1 feels like a bit of a refresh over its predecessor, even though it lacks the narrow bezels and 18:9 display that became a popular trend in 2017.First up is an all-new metal body that gives the Xperia XZ1 a definite leg up over the other members of"

It starts with the cream of the crop, the Sony Xperia XZ2, which features a design motif the company calls Ambient Flow. Its meant to emphasize curves and ergonomics  a stark contrast from the angular designs of Sonys previous phones.The Xperia XZ2checks off a lot of boxes. It has fantastic performance, good battery life, and its camera is more than capable. But its held back by a few software bugs, and its new design language needs to go back to the drawing board for a little more refinement.The bezel-less trend where the edges surrounding a smartphones screen are minimized  kicked off more than a year ago, but Sony apparently just noticed. It has finally trimmed down those edges on the Xperia XZ2, but theyre still not as slim as most of the competition. Even the OnePlus 6, which is $270 cheaper, has thinner bezelsthan the XZ2. The front of the phone is a marked improvement over Sonys previous devices, but it still manages to look a tad dated among the rest of the smartphone market.Thankfully, Sony goes against the grain with dual front-facing stereo speakers, an uncommon sight among flagship phones. The earpiece doubles as a speaker at the top, and the second speaker is hardly noticeable"

When I picked up this phone for the first time, however, I fell in love. It's just so damn cute.Cute isn't a convincing reason to spend $600-plus on anything, but this pint-size phone has a lot going on under the hood, too.

It arrives no more than five months since the Xperia XZ2 hit the shelves, and three months after the XZ2 Premium.Given the short turnaround between devices, it comes as little surprise that the XZ3 is a very familiar smartphone, right down to what's underneath its metal-and-glass enclosure. With a new OLED display and slightly increased battery capacity, though,the XZ3 seems like the device the XZ2 should have been in some ways.However, those improvements demand a higher price. The $899 Xperia XZ3 is $100 more expensive than its predecessor, while still asking owners to make compromises that rival phones don't. Sony could have righted those wrongs; instead, it delivered yet another flagship that fails to meet the standard set by the best Android handsets on the market today.The $899 Xperia XZ3 is available for preorder now through Amazon and begins shipping Oct. 17.

271,vivo nex,"Ever since we first saw them, screen notches have been a contentious issue in smartphone design. What cannot be denied is that the notch is a compromise - conceived in order to make the narrow-bordered smartphones of today a reality. The front camera, earpiece and sensors have to go somewhere, and notches have so far been the solution.In order to get rid of the notch, Vivo has made some bold and risky design choices. The fingerprint scanner has found its way beneath the display, and the front camera is housed in a pop-up mechanism. The earpiece has also been replaced with a motor that vibrates the front glass, and the ambient light sensor lives below the display.The Nex is undoubtedly Vivo's most ambitious smartphone to date. It has been priced at Rs.44,990in India and is definitely one of the most unique smartphones available right now. Can it compete with flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S9 (Review), OnePlus 6 (Review), and Asus's recently launched ZenFone 5Z (Review)? Let's find out in our full review.Vivo Nex designLet's cut to the chase - the Vivo Nex is the most beautiful smartphone that Vivo has ever released. As with all 2018 flagships, you get a premium blend of glass and metal. The glass back has a grey speckled pattern and strikes the right balance"
272,vivo u20,"Vivo brought the Vivo U10 in India in late September to compete with Xiaomi and Realme at the budget end of the market. The Vivo U10 is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor as the Redmi Note 8 and the Realme 5. With the competition churning out phones at such a high rate, it was time for Vivo to push out an update, and now it has, with the Vivo U20. The naming clearly suggests that this is a higher-end model than the Vivo U10, and we are expecting this smartphone to keep the competition in the market alive.Equipped with a powerful Snapdragon 675 SoC, this phone could have an edge over its competition. Will this be enough to sway your choice in its direction? We put the Vivo U20 to the test to find out.Vivo U20 DesignWhen we got our hands on the Vivo U10(Review) we had pointed out that it was boxy and bulky. The new Vivo U20 isn't a whole lot different, as it weighs 193g and is 8.9mm thick. We think that some people will find it too unwieldy for daily use. The display has grown in size, and the IPS LCD panel on the Vivo U20 measures 6.53 inches. It has thin bezels on the sides and a"

Among the crowd, Oppos F series and Vivos V series havestood the test of time, as both companies continue to iterate and refresh them. The company's latest offering is the Vivo V11 Pro, an iterative update to the Vivo V9(Review) which was launched about six months ago. This is the first V series phone to sport an in-display fingerprint sensor, which debuted on the Vivo X21(Review). In many ways, the Vivo V11 Pro is like a selfie-centric version of the X21, andapart from the fingerprint sensor, it also has similar specificationsas its higher-end sibling. Priced at Rs. 25,990, does the V11 Pro have enough to differentiate itself from its rivals? Lets find out in our Vivo V11 Pro review.Vivo V11 Pro designGiven the fact that theres only been a short interval between the launches of the Vivo V9 and V11 Pro, its no surprise that the new model looks pretty much identical to its predecessor. The buttons, SIM tray, ports, and even the rear camera module have virtually identical placements. This phone is also very light thanksto its all-plastic body."
274,vivo v15 pro,"Vivo has shown that it can step up when it comes to smartphone innovation, with devices such as the Vivo Nex(Review) and Vivo Nex Dual Display Edition. New offerings such as the Vivo Apex 2019 are continuing the streak. The Chinese smartphone maker's latest launch in India, the Vivo V15 Pro is meant to bring aspirational and useful features to a more affordable segment, and offers a pop-up selfie camera as well as an in-display fingerprint sensor and triple rear cameras. Launched at Rs. 28,990, the Vivo V15 Pro has a lot going in its favour, including an attractive design, stacked hardware, impressive cameras, and the latest version of Android. Can the Vivo V15 Pro justify its price tag, especially when 2018 value flagships such as the Asus ZenFone 5Z(Review) and the Poco F1(Review) can be purchased for as much or less?Let's take a look at what the Vivo V15 Pro brings to the table and find out.Vivo V15 Pro designThe Vivo V15 Pro is a looker and will draw a few second glances, but not in the same way as many other smartphones out there right now, which have eye-catching designs and colours.

275,vivo v17,"Vivo has been launching smartphones at a rapid pace in the latter half of this year. One recent launch, the Vivo U20, managed to make headlines for its price-to-performance ratio. Surprisingly Vivo has launched yet another smartphone, this time in the V-series, called the Vivo V17. You can look at this new smartphone as a lower-priced version of the Vivo V17 Pro. It lacks the dual pop-up selfie camera module and goes with a hole-punch design instead. Can it justify its Rs. 22,990 price tag in a market crowded with great low-cost devices, including some of Vivo's own? We review to find out.Vivo V17 designThe Vivo V17 looks gorgeous, especially in the Glacier Ice colour finish that we had for this review. We like that Vivo has managed to keep the bezels slim and the camera hole small. The back also packs a compact quad-camera modulethat doesn't take much space. We have seen a similar finish on the Realme XT(Review), which was called Lunar White. If you aren't fond of white phones, you could opt for the Midnight Ocean colour variant instead.We like that the Vivo V17 has super slim bezels at the top and sides of the screen. Vivo has opted for a hole-punch design"
276,vivo v7,"The Vivo V7 is the companys latest addition to its selfie-focused series, and follows in the footsteps of the V7+(Review). This new model is very similar to the V7+ in terms of design and specifications, but with minor reductions to its battery capacity, storage, display size, and of courseprice.The V7 and V7+ are currently Vivos hero products in India, which is evident from the aggressive online and offline marketing campaigns the company has been carrying out. The new Vivo V7 is priced at Rs. 18,990 and hopes to undercut rival Oppos recently launched Oppo F5(Review), which is also a selfie-focused smartphone. We liked the Oppo F5, but lets see if the Vivo V7 is a more compelling offering.Vivo V7 design and build qualityWeve reached a point where metal-bodied smartphones are pretty commonplace in the budget and mid-range segments, but sadly, Vivo doesnt seem to have gotten with this programme. From afar, the body looks like it could be metal, but theVivo V7 has a plastic body, just like the V7+. Even so, we didnt have any issues with the fit and finish of the chassis and buttons. The tapered edges dont offer the best grip but the overall size of the phone makes itcomfortable to hold.The Vivo"
277,vivo v9,"There is no denying that some smartphone manufacturers like to take inspiration from Apples designs. In the past, we have seen dozens of phones designed to look like the iPhone. Now that Apple has made a big design change with the iPhone X(Review), it was only a matter of time before other manufacturers followed suit. Asus was the first one to showcase the Zenfone 5 (2018) and Zenfone 5Z with a design heavily inspired by the iPhone X. Vivo has also taken the same approach withthe Vivo V9, and since Asus hasn't launched its offerings in India yet, Vivo V9 has becomethe first Android smartphone in the country to launch with a notch.The Vivo V9 is making headlines thanks to its thin screen bezel and the notch that sits right at the top. While the device looks pretty interesting, does it have the hardware to justify its Rs. 22,990 price tag? We put it to the test.Vivo V9 designLooking at the tall and narrow display on the Vivo V9, you might assume that its aspect ratio is 18:9 like many others. However, power it on, and thenotch at the top is revealed. The notch is a lot smaller (in width) than the one on the iPhone X, and houses an earpiece, a selfie camera, and the proximity and ambient light sensor"
278,vivo x50 pro,"The Vivo X50 Pro is the first addition to the company's X-series in a very long time. The last phone to be added to the X series was the Vivo X21, which I reviewed way back in 2018. The new Vivo X50 Pro features a gimbal camera system, which is the first of its kind in a smartphone, and is meant to help stabilise video and still shots by compensating for the movement of your hands. I put the Vivo X50 Pro to the test to find out if it's worth your moneyVivo X50 Pro design: Premium lookingThe Vivo X50 Pro is very well designed. It looks premium and feels sturdy in the hand. Vivo has opted for a curved display with thin bezels all around, which give it the impression of having an edge-to-edge display. At first glance, you could mistake it for a Samsung device, as it has a curved display similar to many premium Samsung smartphones, but the similarities end there.Vivo has gone with a thin, metallic frame for the X50 Pro, which is sandwiched between the curved display and the curved rear glass panel. This phone looks sleek and gets cold to the touch in an air-conditioned room. Vivo has used Schott's Xensation Up glass on the front and back for scratch protection. I like the look"
279,vivo x60 pro,"The Vivo X50 Pro was the first smartphone to launch with a gimbal camera system in India. This enabled the primary camera sensor to move physically in order to compensate for shakes and wobbles. Vivo has now launched the Vivo X60 Pro, the successor to the X50 Pro, which claims to improve upon the original. The Vivo X60 Pro also packs in the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 870 SoC which should help it deliver on the performance front as well. I put the X60 Pro through all our usual tests to see how it fares.Vivo X60 Pro price in IndiaThe Vivo X60 Pro is priced at Rs. 49,990 in India. It features 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This smartphone is offered in two colour options, Midnight Black and Shimmer Blue.Vivo X60 Pro designThe Vivo X60 Pro looks similar to its predecessor, the Vivo X50 Pro(Review). While the design is largely unchanged, this isn't an issue since it still looks appealing. The Vivo X60 Pro has a 6.56-inch AMOLED display that curves on the sides just like the older Samsung Galaxy S series smartphones. This makes the side bezels look small, giving the panel an edge-to-edge feel. The top and bottom bezels are slim too and Vivo has added"
280,vivo x70 pro+,"Vivo has been trying to make it into the premium segment for a while with its X series of smartphones. These high-end devices focus on the camera but past models have often fallen short of expectations in other areas, given their premium pricing.The Vivo X50 Pro (Review) introduced a unique gimbal stabilisation feature, but had a mid-range Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G processor at a premium price. Vivo fixed this performance gap with the X60 Pro+ (Review), but it offered no IP rating, wireless charging, or stereo speakers.With the new X70 Pro+, Vivo seems to have done its homework. It's priced at Rs. 79,990 in India, which means it competes with the iPhone 13 (First Impressions), Samsung S21+ (Review), Mi 11 Ultra (Review), and top-end variants of some other premium Android models. Vivo has filled in the gaps of the X60 Pro+ and also upgraded its camera system. After using this phone for a week, it's easy to conclude that this might be one of the best smartphones in the flagship segment.Vivo X70 Pro+ designThe Vivo X70 Pro+ plus ditches the faux leather back that the X60 Pro+ had. Vivo has instead gone with a matte glass finish and a skinny metal frame. The phone is available in a black"

The company has tried on multiple occasions to bring in its premium Mi series models, and the latest one is the Mi 10T Pro. This is a successor to the Xiaomi Mi 10, but comes at a somewhat more affordable price of Rs. 39,999. However, has Xiaomi cut more than just the price? We put Xiaomi's latest flagship to the test to find out.Xiaomi Mi 10T Pro designXiaomi Mi 10T Pro looks and feels premium. Lift the device and you'll instantly feel its 218g weight, which is a bit on the heavier side. There are a few changes to the Mi 10T Pro compared to the Mi 10(Review), the most important of which is the display. You no longer get a curved AMOLED panel; instead, there's a flat LCD. The display measures 6.67 inches and has a camera hole in the top left corner. While the flat LCD panel might seem like a downgrade, Xiaomi has increased the refresh rate to 144Hz. This does make animations appear smooth and makes browsing through the menus feel fluid.

284,xiaomi mi a2,"Xiaomi has launched the Mi A2 as its second Android One phone in India.Google originally started the Android One programme to deliver the stock Android experience on entry-level handsets in developing markets. However, there were no new products in India after the initial launchesfrom Karbonn, Micromax and Spice. Google later revived Android One in 2017 to offer users smartphones running stock Android without any manufacturer customisations. The first of these in India was the Xiaomi Mi A1(Review) which launched last year.More manufacturers have enrolled into the program since then, but very few devices have made it to India. Nokia, an HMD Global brand, was the first to announce that its entire Android lineup would adopt Android One and all the smartphones that it announced at MWC 2018 have now launched in India. The new Mi A2 promises better hardware while still running bone-stock Android. So should the Xiaomi Mi A2 be the first choice for an Android purist on a budget? We put it to the test.Xiaomi Mi A2 designThe Mi A2 is a well-designed smartphone. It has a metal unibody that gives it a premium feel in the hand. The first change you will notice compared to the Mi A1 is that it has a big 5.99-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, which makes the phone tall and thin"
285,xiaomi mi a3,"The Mi A1 (Review) was the first smartphone from Xiaomi to be a part of Google's Android One programme. It had powerful hardware for the price like most other Xiaomi smartphones, but ran stock Android instead of Xiaomi's own MIUI. While the device did not generate the same amount of buzz as its Redmi siblings, it did find some takers. Xiaomi launched a successor a year later in the form of the Mi A2 (Review). While Xiaomi Mi A2 was arguably one of the best camera smartphones in the sub-Rs. 20,000 segment at the time, it had a few shortcomings. It lacked a 3.5mm headphone jack, and storage wasn't expandable. Xiaomi has now launched a successor to the Mi A2, aptly called the Mi A3. This new model makes up for the shortcomings of the Mi A2, but has Xiaomi skimped on anything else? We review the Mi A3 to find out.Xiaomi Mi A3 designThe Xiaomi Mi A3 has a glass sandwich design, a change compared to the metal-clad Mi A2. There is Corning Gorilla Glass 5 at the front and back, as well as on the camera module, which should help the device resist scratches from day-to-day usage to some extent.

286,xiaomi mi max,"There was a time, not too long ago, when it was not uncommon to see people carrying 7-inch tablets around as their primary phones. As ridiculous as it looked, it was a trend that caught on and we have Samsung's affordable Tab series to thank (or blame) for that. Last year, we witnessed Lenovo attempting to get in on that action with the Phab Plus (Review), and today, we have Xiaomi taking a stab at this niche market with the Mi Max.Just like Lenovo's offering, the Mi Max focuses purely on content consumption (and perhaps a bit of creation too), be it videos, games, or even apps. Given its feature set and specifications, the Mi Max can be considered a larger rendition of the Redmi Note 3 (Review), another very popular phone. But has Xiaomi got the formula right with the Mi Max? We've spent nearly a week with the device and here's what we think. Look and feelIt's not rocket science to make a large-screened smartphone, but the ability to achieve a balance between size, weight, and ergonomics is what sets the good ones apart. The Mi Max features a 6.44-inch full-HD display with Gorilla Glass 3 and the company's proprietary Sunlight Display tech for better outdoor legibility. Make no mistake, this screen is massive, and the Mi Max manages to make the"
287,xiaomi mi mix 2s,"Those who hate the notch might just love the Mi Mix 2S, the latest premium smartphone from China's Xiaomi. While that name might be unfamiliar to most in the U.S., Xiaomi has garnered a worldwide reputation in recent years for innovative design, powerful hardware and low prices, even though the bulk of the company's products never make it out of Asia. And there's no better example of those traits in the company's portfolio than the Mi Mix series, which manages a mostly bezel-free look without relying on an unsightly notch.Like all of Xiaomi's wares, the Mi Mix 2S is technically unavailable on our shores. However, while most of Xiaomi's other phones lack support for Western networks, the Mi Mix 2S is a truly global device, with support for GSM networks everywhere, including AT&T and T-Mobile in the U.S.But here's the real question: Now that U.S. customers can finally use one of China's hottest phones, should they go through the trouble and expense of importing this device? Unique though the Mi Mix 2S inarguably is, it makes too many compromises for us to put it among the elite tier of Android mainstays, such as the Galaxy S9 and Pixel 2.The Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S starts at 3,299 yuan, which translates to a little less than $530.

288,xiaomi mi mix 3,"For smartphones, this is shaping up to be the year of the wandering selfie camera. After the controversial Age of the Notch, lots of phone makers are trying to find ways to keep the front-facing camera's utility without resorting to bezels or sacrificing other areas of prime display real estate.You've got the Honor View 20 punch-hole approach, the Oppo Find X motorized pop-up camera, as well as some phones for which the manufacturers doubled down on the notch, like the Google Pixel 3 XL. But could there be another way? Xiaomi thinks so.The Chinese phone maker has decided to redevelop the slider design from the pre-smartphone era of cell (mobile) phones and use it to give you a completely clean display that still allows a dual selfie camera. Combined with another twin camera array on the back, some powerful memory and processing within and a large screen, the resulting Mi Mix 3 offers great performance for a comparatively paltry 499 ($640). Xiaomi's new midrange phone is largely successful, but because of some of the Mi Mix 3's features, it won't be for everyone.Apologies to our U.S. readers: The Mi Mix 3 isn't on sale in your country, at least outside of imports (and buying imports carries its own set of risks).

This phone brings a tonne of upgrades, both minor and major, over its predecessor  the Redmi 6A  without the price hike that often comes with a new-generation device. Starting at Rs. 5,999, the Redmi 7A aims to further solidify Xiaomi's dominance in the entry-level segment, but competition has intensified now.A new design, faster processor, larger battery, and better camera are among the many upgrades introduced by Xiaomi in the Redmi 7A.

291,xiaomi redmi note 3,"Xiaomi's Redmi series has been wildly popular over the past few years and for good reason. The low prices and good features have really set these models apart, and even other Chinese players have found them hard to compete with. Thanks to this competition, you can get a lot more in a budget or even mid-range smartphone than you used to be able to a few years ago.After pushing powerful components and cutting prices, manufacturers have started focusing on premium aesthetics and build quality, which appeal even more to customers. We've seen a lot of metal being being used by companies rather than plastic, such as with the recently released Honor 5 X (Review) and Le Eco Le 1s (Review). In terms of specifications, 3GB of RAM is not something to boast about anymore, and Coolpad has proven to everyone with the Coolpad Note 3 (Review) that even fingerprint sensors are not restricted to premium phones.In light of all this, the Redmi 2 series feels a bit dated, and so Xiaomi is right on time with the new Redmi Note 3. We had a first look at the device back in December, although that was the original version running on a MediaTek processor. The one launched in India sports a more potent Qualcomm chip which should make it more competitive. Just like the Xiaomi Redmi 2 Prime, the Redmi Note 3 will also be made in China"

One recent example of this strategy was the predecessor to the Redmi Note 6 Pro. With the Redmi Note 5 Pro, the Chinese manufacturer has been very hard to beat around the Rs. 15,000 price mark thanks to the use of the Snapdragon 636 SoC. The device has been extremely popular, so naturally, that increases the expectations we have from its successor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro.Xiaomi seems to be playing safe and has retained the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor.

The first few phones from the online-exclusive brand were the original Yu Yureka, Yu Yuphoria, and Yu Yureka Plus, which showed just how much a buyer could get for relatively little money. The brand claims to have sold over 3 million phones so far in India.International Data Corporation (IDC) data shows that until March last year Micromax was the second-highest selling smartphone vendor in India, with a strong offline as well as online presence.

Pot-shots aside, it's clear that Yu is going after the Chinese manufacturers like OnePlus, Xiaomi, Gionee and Oppo who have long been offering ""flagship killers"" without having to empty your bank account. The aptly named Yutopia is an imagining of what a perfect smartphone should be like, while still being affordable to the masses. Yu has certainly got the ingredients right but how it all comes together in the end, is what really matters. Is the Yutopia every bit as good as it looks on paper? Let's find out. Look and feelThe aluminium and magnesium chassis is one of the highlights of the phone. It feels incredibly premium and has good ergonomics. The phone is also comfortably slim and heavy enough to not feel like you're holding a toy.
