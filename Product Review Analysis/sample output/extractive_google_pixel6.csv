0,google pixel 6,"It's also a shame that this device has grown and there's no longer a compact size option from Google.But they're easy things to look past  the reasons you would buy this Pixel phone continue to be the reasons you would buy any Pixel phone: primarily, speedy Android updates for the next few years, a bloat-free software experience with some nice Google-y tweaks, and a camera that's going to outperform most of the others on the market at the moment.One of the best phones for most people is still the iPhone 13, with a 6.1-inch screen, or theiPhone 13 Miniwhich has an even smaller screen at just 5.4-inches.You can read our Pixel 6 Pro review to see them in action.Google's clever software now also features Face Unblur which helps to clearly capture faces even in the toughest conditions, as well as 'Real Tone', and it means portraits taken on the Pixel 6 should reflect all skin tones more accurately.In terms of front cameras, the Pixel 6 has an 8-megapixel sensor with a /2.0 aperture and an 84-degree wide field of view.The Pixel 6 supports 5G and runs on Google new Tensorprocessor, which is paired with an ample 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage (with no memory card expansion slot).Google claims Tensor gives up to 80-percent faster performance than Pixel 5, so apps load quicker and gaming is more responsive.The Pixel 6 has achieved an average Geekbench 5 score of 2837  which is good, but not as good as other flagship phones.From gaming to photo editing to email, we didn't notice any lag or stutter from the Pixel 6 during our time testing it.The Pixel 6 display and stereo speakers work well for watching shows and movies, and although the screen isn't huge, it's perfectly fine as a media player.It also makes the phone top-heavy and unbalanced.However, it does stretch the entire width of the phone case, so it doesn't rock when put on a flat surface.It's certainly not a major issue, but it is an odd design choice.The phone is officially IP68-rated, which means it's able to survive being submerged in water at a depth of 1.5 metres (nearly 5 feet) for up to 30 minutes, which gives you some extra peace of mind.There's no headphone jack here, just a USB-C port.Ever since the first Pixel, these phones have shone in terms of photo-taking  not in the raw specs, but in the quality of the image processing that Google is able to apply through its software.That's not the same thing as Android software updates, where it sounds like you're still going to get three, but it's a step toward providing the kind of lengthy support that Apple gives its iPhones, meaning you'll be able to hold onto this device longer.The Pixel 6 is the best phone Google's ever made."
